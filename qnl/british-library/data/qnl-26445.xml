For the reason© given in my record of the discussion© at . miaan, I now think that Trans- Jordan has a strong case, subject to the consideration that the nationality of the j.tm, (and indeed th# other sections of the Huwaltat) derives from habitat in the ifaba- ( p&amp;sm area, I think we should resist Xbn daud , s elala but in auch, a way as to throw on 'him the onus of stating the grounds on which he claims the /tun. It may prove that he is relying on the theory that all persons in the 4qi*bft~Mast&amp; district are ^ i8 subjects, if h# definitely takes this line, it will he open to us to argue that the Juridical question 1 - r * abeyance but that under the modus vivandl such persons M.fjot© under the jurisdiction of Trans-Jordan and that we arc entitled to protect their interests on that ground, &lt;$, As regards (b) the issues now seem to resolve themselves into the followings- (1) Xfen ©id does not appear to contest the view (theugh Ibn u-attd might do so) that camels covered by the lee onmll finding,/.-inking no longer hm el«|med from the present holfera m A&amp;mtf* He r^ata hi a e*®« for the retention of certain of th@ Atim oimela on tm allegation that they wer® looted aubeequently to august 1, imo.

If the principle of this suggestion im approved, l would propose to prepare a draft note for eons Id® ration here and at the Colonial Office, dareh 4th 193c,December 2nd, His Majesty’s Government have learnt that the raid on the Atun was discussed between Sheykh Abdul-Aziz I bn ?;eid and I 0attain Glubb at their meeting on January 8th and 9th. It appears that that discussion did not turn on the question of the nationality of the Atun but broke down owing to a disagreement on other points, notably the question whether the local authorities had been right in allowing the raiders to retain certain of the camels looted from the Atun on the ground that they were ,: 'Araif n ' and in assigning certain other camels to soldiers as a reward for their services. The first of these questions depended on whether, if the camels claimed by the raiders as their rightful property were in fact l *Araif% they had come into the possession of the Atun before or after August 1st, 1950. Captain Glubb held that the Atun, who had been in peaceful possession of the camels in question before the raid of September 28th, were in the/the position of plaintiffs and -were entity in accordance with tribal law and custom, to offer proof that they had acquired the camels before August 1st, 1930, in which case any camels which might have originally fallen to be regarded as Araif would have become their property in virtue of the finding arrived at by His Majesty’s Government as a result of Mr* MacDonnell’@ investigation. It was also a subject of discussion whether, even if the local authorities believed these camels to have been acquired by the Atun subsequently to August 1st, 1930, they should have been left in the possession of the raiders pending the conclusion of the meetings between Captain Olubb and Ibn £eid. In this connexion Captain Glubb invoked an understanding, which he had come to with Oheykh Ab&amp;ul-As&amp;is last June, to the effect that the authorities on both sides should refrain from depriving tribes in their territory of camels alleged to have been looted until the two representatives had arrived at a decision, A#/4 */ T ] fc* regard© the coriels given to soldiers by ray of rewardj Captain Glu'bb drew attention ;o proceedings on the part of the local Uut l *^rities which seemed to Mm to be open to jriticism. h It is entirely in accordance with the rrequently expressed opinion of His Majesty’s to vernment that all such questions should be lealt with between the local authorities on &gt;oth sides of the Transjordan frontier in a spirit of co-operation and mutual assistance, 'hey consider that Captain Glubb was right in regarding the Atun as the plaintiffs and also In his interpretation of the understanding of Last June, which was on the lines of the proposal made by the Hejassi Government them selves in a note which Your Koyal Highness addressed to- Sir A* By an on June £Snd last. Is regard© the camels assigned to soldiers, fHis Majesty’s Government consider it mdeslr&amp;ble that any deduction of this kind should be made when the authorities on either side have occasion to restore loot.4 I am instructed by my Government to request that aheykh Abdul-^ziz Ibn 2eid may be instructed to accept Captain Glubb 1 s views on the above points and to continue the discussion | oi the case with him. My Government are impress ed by the importance of an early settlement of the question, as the capture of so many Atan camels by Hejdi tribesmen has created considerable feeling among the Howeitat and may, unless speedy restitution on &amp; full scale is effected, lead to a renewal of raiding contrary to the wishes of both Governments. My Government are confident that, if the matter is dealt with in this manner, it will prove possible question of nationality. If, however, it were necessary to pursue this question, they can only say that they are at a loss to understand on what ground the Atun are now claimed as Bejasi nationals .! The authorities in Transjordan lay u no claim to Audah Al-Atna and his personal party, who were mentioned in the course of Sir G. Clayton’s negotiations in 1927 and who are to dispose of it without further reference to the ^ understoodunderstood to have been .permanently established /I In Hejazi territory since that time. The information in the possession of His Majesty’s 1 ■&gt; Government leads them to believe on the other hand that the generality of the Atun, a section of the howeitat Ibn Jazi, have, like the other sections of this tribe, always been regarded as Transjordanian tribesmen and have long had their main residence in territory administered by His Majesty the Amir of fransjordan and his GovernmentHot# by $lr &amp;«ly&amp;n on bl® €seloner for 1729 with the *932 * ^ -Vi+rHfV. .«Mt • I iiae » good deal of general dLmuaalon with Oeaaral faaohope during ay stay la Jeruaalen, Apart tram ttile we reviewed on February 16 the aoet laportant.

With reference to my telegram Ho. 245 of the 4th December, regarding the Atun section of the Howeyt'at, whose camels were raided on the 28th October by the Beni Atiya, I have the honour to transmit herewith a record of all recent mentions of this tribal section found in the 1928 to 1931 raid-files of the Legation 1 s archives. I have had this record made in order to determine as accurately as possible how the family of Atnas has been regarded in past years by the Trans-Jordan and Hejas-Hejd Oovernments. Most of the attached evidence is unfortunately inconclusive. Atnas have promiscuously fallen under a general heading of r Trans-Jordan trioes u or 'Trans-Jordan Beduin 5f in a number of Hejazi protests which contained long lists of miscellaneous raiders (see extracts Dos. 7,8,9,12, 13,14,16,18,20). This can hardly be talien as conclusive evidence that the Hejazi Oovernmerit have renounced them as their subjects, for there is precise evidence to the contrary. They seem rather to have included them loosely under this heading for convenience and to have intended it in a territorial rather than a national sense, since all raided from Trans-Jordan territory. It is to be notea, indeed, that whenever a Hejazi protest has been made against a single Atna raid, the phrase 'Trans-Jordan Beduin r has been avoided (see extracts Hos. 10,11,21), excepr m one instance (extract Ho.15), where Sufian el Atna was precisely stated by the Hejazi Government to be a 'Trans-Jordan subject'. 3.3. Apart from this evidence, most of which I take to he inconclusive for the precise purpose of establishing national status, it seems clear from the rest of the record that from 1928 until the beginning of this year the Atun section, if this is indeed the section headed by the famous ^.uda al Atna, was regarded as Hejazi. As early as February 1926 camels were recovered by the Trans-Jordan Government from Auda al Atna and returned to the Hejazi authorities (see enclosure S in His Majesty 1 s Governments memorandum of the 2nd October 1930). In May 1928 (Extract No.l) Sir G. Clayton informed Ibn Sa T ud that the Trans-Jordan Government regarded Auda al Atna as one of the Chiefs of tribes resident in the Hejaz and not as one of their subjects. In June 1928 (extract Ho.4) the Hejazi Government complained of a raid made by the Beni Sakhr against Al Atna. In December 1928 (extract Ho.11) the Hejazi Government admitted that Auda al Atna was one of their subjects, but pointed out that he was a notorious criminal whom both the Hejaz-Hejd and the Trans- Jordan Government had agreed to catch. At the beginning of 1929 the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to Al Atna as Hejd subjects (extract Ho.13). In the autumn of 1930 Auda al Atna and Mutloq al Atna moved into the Hejaz and the Hejazi Government were advised to bring them to account (extracts Bos.22 and 24). In February 1931 (extract Ho.25) the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan stated that certain raiders were members of the Atun section ana that pending the conclusion of enquiries the Trans-Jordan Government could not!admit that Trans-Jordan Beduin were responsible) I cannot however trace any relevant result of these enquiries. Until the beginning of this year, then, it seems clear that the Atun section of the Howeytfit, in addition to or under Auda al Atna, were regardefl by both Governments as Hejazi subjects who had for years been raiding the Hejaz from Trans-Jordan territory. 4.1 a ^ will be noticed however that in June of this year ulie High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan for the first time used the phrase T the Atoon section of the Trans-Jordan howeitat ' (extract No. 26), in connection with a Hejazi raid on one Salim at Atna; the Hejazi Government in reply asserted their inability to agree that Salim al Atna and his party were Trans-Jordan subjects. In October, the acting High Commissioner for Trans-iJordan wrote of IT Sinian el Atnah of the Trans-Jordan Howeitat rT (extract No. 27), which produced the categorical Hejazi rejoinder that TAl Atha are subjects of His Iviajesty the King and Thinian al _tna is naturally one of them 11 . 5. I am no conversant v^ith the tribal genealogy of the Howeyt&amp;t nor can I find any reference in any of the official tribal lists or handbooks to an Atiin section of the Howeytat. If it is true,however, that the At.un section is that headed by Audu al Atna and referred to by Sir G. Clayton, there appears to have been a change in the Trans- Jordan view of their status between February and June this year, whereas the Hejazi view has been consistently maintained, with the one clear exception of Sufian al Atna. Having received a further despatch from His Excellency the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan on the subject of Sinian (or Thinian) al Atna T s camels (extract No. 27), a copy of my reply to which is attached, I shall be grateful for instructions as to what attitude I should adop^ vis-a-vis of the Hejazi Government in regard to the various raiaers and victims of the Atna family. 6.

It will be noticed from the report that Ibn Zeid did not advance the theory that the Atoon are not a Trans-Jordanian tribe which has been the reason advanced by the Hejaz Government for refusing to restore the looted camels to the Atoon. 3 # Discussion also turned upon the levying of taxes by Nejdi officials on Trans-Jordan tribes and in this connection I would refer to correspondence ending with my despatch Confidential dated 16th January, 1932. 4.

Amiaan 18th January, 1932. Your Excellency, I have the honour to forward herewith a letter from the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion No.ALC/50/fi of the 15th January, 1932, giving an account of the meeting of the 7th January, 1932, between Captain dlubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeid. 2. 1 have thought it well to obtain and forward as well Captain Glubb's own report since this latter j\ .| j document gives a more complete picture of the situation and will prove of greater value to His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah than the summary which Colonel Peake has compiled. 3. It is interesting to observe that Ibn Zeid has not attempted to justify the retention of the looted animals on the ground that the iitoon are not a irans- Jordan tribe and one can only assume that Ibn Saoud has forgotten to instruct him as to this fallacy or that from j|| very shame he could not maintain it. 4. As stated in precious correspondence, with one or two exceptions the ’araif' amongst the camels looted j from the Atoon were acquired by that tribe prior to the 1st August, 1930 and such 'araif should, as a result of the award of His Majesty's Government following on the MacDonnell investigation, be returned to the Atoon il regardless of the question of nationality or of the manner of acquiring the camels. See my letter Ko.RN/13 of the 29th December, 1931, paragraph 4, and my letter 38/Sec &gt;£ the 25th November, 1931. IfIf the statement that these camels were acquired I by the Atoon prior to the 1st August 1930 is questioned by the Hejd Authorities, the Atoon should be required to prove their case in accordance with tribal custom as defined by Captain Glubb. 5. As regards any of the ’araif* acquired after the 1st August, 1930, these should be returned if Ibn Saoud accepts the true and just contention of the Trans-Jordan Government that the Atoon are a Trans-Jordan tribe by virtue of the fac that they have spent the majority of their time in that territory for the past five years. Otherwise the Atoon claim can be written off as a bad claims debt as has so frequently been the case with Trans-Jordan in the past and in that case 1 ask that Ibn Saoud’s complaints be not listened to if the Trans-Jordan Government takes from the Sherarat and other Kejdian tribes, when they enter Trans-Jordan, araif which have been looted since 1st August, 1930. 6. As regards claims arising from raids after 1st August, 1930, which Captain Glubb declined to discuss, I would refer to the ooinion expressed in the ultimate paragraph of my letter lo*3B/3ec of the 25th November, 1931, which I still hold. Generally, I would state that there is little prospect of these meetings between the Hejd and Trans jordan Representatives leading to the final settlement of such claims so long as the llejd delegate is denied all authority by his principal. 7. As regards taxation, I have repeatedly asked lour Excellency to cause the question of the injustice of these collections to be taken up with Ibn Oaoud but so far without result. 8. The extent of Ibn Saoud's dishonesty and unwillingnessunwillingness to cooperate for peace on the frontier will I hope he realised; and it will further he understood that, though these frontier meetings are most useful, no settlement of frontier difficulties can he honed for when the Hejdian delegate is hound bj detailed orders from which he dare not depart. 9. I venture to draw Your Excellency's attention to the feat accomplished hy Captain Glubh in so far preventing the i.toon and other Howeitat from embarking on retaliatory raids in spite of the losses they have suffered.

On 7.1.32 1 iaet Ibn 2eid by appointment at Thamilat EUOaXDA, a point on the frontier between RADITHA and RA3IBALHA. We each pitched tents about two hundred yards anart. We entertained Ibn Zeid ana his followers to dinner while myself and the police with me lunched with him on the morning of 8.1.32. Phe proceedings were exceedingly amicable. As this is our third meeting we are now quite old friends, both with Abdul Aziz Ibn Seid himself and with his oriyate retainers. The only trouble with Ibn Seid is that he is unable to negotiate at all. He presumably receives precise instructions from Ibn Saoud, and reoeats them to me verbatim. Should I disagree or make an alternative suggestion, he is unable to even express an opinion, but is obliged to postpone the matter until the next meeting to enable him, in the interval, to report to Ibn Saoud and receive fresh orders. It must not be thought from this that the meetings are valueless. Even by such methods negotiations on the spot are better than correspondence through London and Jeddah. Again the mere fact that apparently amicable meetings are taking place between the two parties impresses the tribes and promotes law and or er. Unfortunately Ibn Zeid f s position is weak. He is a man of clerkly profession, of low birth and a former employee of Ibn Bashid, who are always open to suspicion under the Saod regime. Moreover the Governors of Tebukand Jauf both Sadairis of noble family and related to I bn Saoud himself (his mother was a Sadairi) are exceedingly jealous of the fact that external relations are solely in the hands of Ibn Zeid, and, it is said, lose no opportunity to maligne him and report to Ibn Saoud that he is disloyal and intriguing with the English. This renders Ibn Seid exceedingly cautious, and especially afraid to make any concession or show himself too amenable lest such an action confirm the reports sent to Ibn Saoud of his disloyalty. m kmr MOTE . In Arabic, the verb S! araf n means to recognise or know, and amongst beduins the term tT araif n 'kW * is applied to camels, formerly raided from him, and which he finds and recognises in the possession of some other persons. In this report I shall use the word ?l araif H as being shorter than writing* 'camels recognised as . « having been formerly raidei from them”. One of the first subjects mooted was of course that of the camels raided on 28th September last from the Atoon Howltat at Mudawara. It will be recollected that the Atoon claim to have lost 192 camels, of which 36 were returned by the Amir of Tebuk. In addition a number of camels were raided at the same time from the Beni Atiya at HAS, the exact number not being known to us, as the victims were regarded to be Hedjaz subjects. It is believed, however, that about 18 were returned to them. Ibn Seid, asked about the affair, replied that he could not give exact figures as the case had been originally dealt with by the xmir 0 £ Jauf. He stated verbally, however, that he believed the following figures to be virtually correct TotalTotal looted (from Beni Atiya and the I toon) Returned to Tebuk for return to owners (Beni Atiya and A toon) TO Retained in Jauf t araif of the Sh&amp;rarat, about 40, say Commission taken bv soldiers in Jauf, dead and miscellaneous 1 125 !4QTK . The number 70 sent to Tebuk appears to be exact. The Amir of Tebuk accounted tor these as follows Returned to A to on Returned to Beni Atiya Died Miscellaneous or 1 forget what 36 18 10 PRF!YT ..ills At our previous meetings, Ibn Aeid and myself had reached certain verbal agreements, of which I reminded him on this occasion. He did not deny them. They were as follows:- (a) AlLai^ • For several years and until December 193'J, * *-he Sherarat and Howeitat had been raiding one another without * cessation. As a result about half the camels now in possession of the Howeitat were raided by them in the past from the Sherarat and vice versa, fhen Ibn ^eid and I held our first meeting last spring, the Sherarat were camped near Kaf and were desirous of entering irans- Jordan to buy grain, but were afraid of doing so, lest the Government seize the Howeitat camels in their possession and return them to the latter tribe. Ibn 2eid therefore proposed that we make mutual agreement not to seize araif which we might find in the possession of the tribes such to the other Goverm.ent. is myjdesxre was to secure oeace and good order for all. which such seizures wouldwould undoubtedly upset, I agreed, although at that moment the agreement was entirely in favour of the Sherarat. The latter accordingly circulated freely and unmolested in Trans-Jordan the whole summer with hundreds of camels in their possession formerly raided from us. similarly several sections of the Howeitat have been camped for the past two months in the hadi Sirhan, and camels, formerly raided from Nejd, in their possession have not been taken from them. Subsequent to our verbal agreement, arrived the decision of His Majesty’s Government on the M&amp;cDonnell Arbitration, that all claims for loot taken prior to 1st August, 1930, are buried. Hence all animals looted prior to this date have now become the legal property of the looters and there can be no 'araif” from them. Again Ibn Zeid and 1 agreed that all camels looted subsequent to 1st. Hamadhan (17th January 1931 I think) should be immediately returned. Thus the only loot left in possession of both sides, the ultimate disposal of which is still uncertain, is that taken between 1st August 1930 and the 17th January 1931. This loot is still governed by our verbal agreement not to seise ?l araif n ♦ Either all this loot will be returned or it will all be buried, but both sides have agreed not to seise it when found. With all the above Ibn £eid agreed and concurred that our verbal agreement was still in force. He stated, however, that this agreement did not include 'araif” brought in as loot. He admitted that neither Government had the right to seise n araif found in possession of camps, or caravans. 1 replied that this was obviously a ridiculous position. What his attitude amounted to ms that 'If you see camels formerly raided from■ • ■ 'I J from you, in possession of tribesmen subjects of the other Government, we, your Government, cannot recover them for you. But if you then raid the tribesmen in question you may retain the 'araif 1 ® which come with the loot, and return the balance”* Ihis, I said, was obviously preposterous and a direct encouragement to raiding* there were so many ’araifs” with all the tribes that, under this theory, raiding would b© well worth while* Zven, if, when we ^reed not to seise n araif H we did not specifically include f araif ?l found amongst loot brought by our own tribes, yet we did not exclude them either, and, failing a specific exclusion, the agreement covered all 'araif”, and, anyhow as stated above, the very last type of 'araif' which ought to be permitted were obviously those brought illegally as loot* Ibn Zeid was rather stumped by this, but changed his tactics and said that, whether preposterous or not, this procedure had precedents. In January 1931, the Howeitat raided the Hedjaz and before returning the loot, I had taken from it one camel which was recognised by the Howeitat as having previously been raided from them. This I admitted, although 1 pointed out that the precedent was not set by me. In September 1930, the Sherarat raided 120 camels from the Howeitat and the Nejd Government returned only 80, stating that the rest were 'araif”. The point was, however, that both these cases occurred prior to our verbal agreement. Conditions at that time were very different, the tribes were virtually at war and raid followed raid back and forth across the frontier. How things had completely settled down, and we were, praise be to Allah, sitting side by side discussing matters in the most friendly manner. In the interval, we had reached aa friendly gentleman’s agreement which now bound us both. To say thatboth sides had made violent seizures a year \ ago before this agreement was reached, did not establish a precedent. Ibn Zeid was again rather non-plussed by this, and as a matter of fact, of course, the poor fellow had no case at all. He, however, once more had recourse to the argument, dealt with above, that our agreement did not specifically include 'araif* found amongst loot brought by raiders. (b) In addition to this verbal agreement regarding ?1 araif f1 we had reached, at a previous meeting, a verbal agreement regarding the procedure to be followed in the event of a raid. This was that the Government to which the raiders were subject should immediately and without delay collect all the loot it could fxnd, and send it across to the Government to which the victims were subject. If the victims claimed that they had lost more than this amount, and that the Government of the raiders could not find any more in the possession of the latter, then ne (Ibn Zeid) and I should meet, bringing the raiders and the raided with us, and, by confronting the two parties, that we should endeavour to ascertain the truth. I pointed out to him that the Atoon alone claimed 192 camels, while the Arair of Jauf stated that he had only found 125 camels with the raiders, including those looted from Beni Atiya. In this matter, however, it was impossible to say who was lying, but was ready to follow the procedure previously agreed to between us, and hold a meeting at which the raiders and raided should confront one another. I must, however, ask Ibn Zeia first to ..ana over the forty odd camels now in possession of the Amir ofof J&amp;uf, according to our previous agreement not to take ?, araif H , ihis was th© corKjlusion of our disoussions on »lb3 f.i tb t day* xhinking th© irntter ov@r at night, however, I decided to make a concession* Although, as explain©,! above, the f'lejd Government had no right to take any ,f araif ?l at all, yet H araif !t from loot taken between August 1st 1930 and 17th January 1931, was governed only by our verbal agreement • Being an clous to secure a solution, 1 decided to waive our rights under the verbal agreement. To this 1 was partly induced by the following cons iterations. Although I cannot guarantee that 193 camels were actually raided from the A toon, yet I know that the two principal victims danaiyan and Marauq al Atnah, had between 70 and 80 camels between them* Marsuq enlisted last year as a policeman, and was posted to Mudawara. His faadly and that of his cousin, Sanaiyan came and camped outside the fort, and remained there for live months. Their camels daily watered at the well, and both myself and all the other people (police) came to know them well. How of these 75 odd camels only 12 were returned. Again San&amp;iyaa was formerly a famoue raider, and during the summer of 1930, he was imprisoned for raiding* When he was released, he was made to report to the police every seven days, to make sure that he was not raiding again. By this and other enquiries 1 m fairly certain that neither Sanaiyan nor Marsuq raided between lat August 1930 and 17th January 1931. On the other hand, both were noted raiders in the past, and have many camels raided from the Sherarat prior to 1st August 1930. 1 was therefor© fairlvfairly confident that if the 45 odd camels still in Jauf are ?, araif n t they were all or practically all, raided prior to 1st August. When we met next morning, therefore, 1 enquired from Ibn Zeid whether the n araif !t claimed were raided 'before or after 1st August 1930. He replied that all the claimants alleged that they had 'been raided after that date. He agreed that there could be no f, arai£ ft prior to that date, as both sides had buried all such claims. To this I replied that I was willing to make a great concession and waive our gentlemen’s agreement. If he brought up the camels, we could hold another meeting and &gt; I would bring the Atoon and they would be asked to establish by witnesses or oath, that each of the camels in question had been raided by them prior to August 1st., 1930, or had not been raided by them at all, as the‘case might be, anyhow that it had not been raided by them subsequent to August 1st 1930. Any camels which proved to have been raided subsequent to August 1st 1930, I would make him a present of, in spite of our gentlemen’s agreement. To this he replied that he could not agree to this procedure, but that he agreed to suramon the bherarat, who should establish by witnesses or oath, that all the camels in question had been raided from them since 1st August 1930. To this I replied that this ms to make a laughing stock of us all. The Sherarat would bring half a dozen other Sherarat, who would for twenty piastres would swear that all the camels were raided after 1st August. Ibn beid replied that, if the Sherarat were liars, he had no reason to believe that the Howeitat were angels fr m heaven. I readily admitted that both tribes had an unenviableunenviable and not undeserved reputation for mendacity, but that the Atoon were the plaintiffs, and that Arab custom invariably gave the plaintiff prior right of bringing witnesses. (Under tribal custom, both sides do not bring witnesses and the judge decides!* The Plaintiff has prior right and if he brings forward satisfactory witnesses, he wins the case. Only if he fails to produce witnesses has the defendant the right to bring witnesses). Anyhow the benefit of the doubt should undoubteily be given to the Atoon, who had done nothing wrong, rather than to the Aherarat who had committed a flagraat breach of the neace in broad daylight, when raiding had ceased for many months and the situation was peaceful and quiet. Ibn Seid, however, replied that the Sherarat were the ulaintiffs, trying to recover the camels brutally raided from them after 1st August, 1930. As Ibn Zeid was unable to accept any proposal other than that the oherarat should bring witnesses and their testimony be accepted as conclusive, I withdrew my previous concession and we agreed to differ. It seemed to me quite futile to agree to such terms, from which we should probably recover absolutely nothing, Uut, by previously agreeing to it we should forfeit all our rights. The feet is that Ibn 2»eid had probably instructions from Ibn Baoud to offer a meeting at which the Sherarat should produce their witnesses before ooth Governments. This appears to the unwary, a fair concession, whereas in reality it is little more than a trick to keep our camels with our consent. Anyhow, I may repeat that the right to keep «araif' at all, even if taken after 1st August, is negatived by our verbal agreement of last May. aim11)11 2eid then said that this was anyhow a small matter of a few oaraels, and now we discuss the whole question of loot taken between 1st August 1930, and 17th January, 1931. To this 1 replid that there was not much hone of our recovering camels looted 18 months ago (nearly all the raids in question were in August and September), if we could not effect restitution of those taken 3 months ago. He then asked me regarding 10 Anaizah camels at Mudawara, whose history is as follows:- Last summer, Beni Atiya raided Anaizah in the Hedjaz. Both parties were Hedjazis living in the Hedj&amp;z. Ten of the looted camels were however sent off secretly by one of the raiders to be sold in Palestine and were intercepted by the Trans-Jordan desert Police en route. In October, when 1 sent the Atoon owners to Jauf with a letter to Ibn Zeid to return their animals, I, in all good faith, informed him of this affair. Had it not been for my letter, the Mejd Authorities knew nothing of these animals. Ibn Zeid now asked me if I was prepared to hand them over. 1 replied that all such would settle themselves, if we could reach an agreement on the Atoon camels. He took the hint and dropped the matter. Actually, one of these camels is dead and nine are with the Atoon victims of the raid, who are otherwise destitute. I then complained to Ibn Aeid oi the actions of the Hejd tax collectors in the Ladi Lirhan. ihe l rano Jordan Government, 1 said, did not admit their right to tax Trans-Jordan tribes in the Wadi Sirhan at all. Apart from this, however, the time honoured procedure in such matters was for the Government in question to 'wait untilforeign tribes had entered and camped in its territory for sorne mouths or at any rate a reasonable period, before demanding a year's taxes. The Hejd collectors had however been demanding a year's taxes from people for the privilege of watering their camels beyond the frontier, although camped in nrvigrazing in Trans-Jordan - Agair a man of the Koweitat camped near Maan had lost camels, which strayed when out grazing. They were found by a man who subsequently moved camp and settled across the border. The owner heard of them and followed and recovered his animals. Before taking them away, he was obliged to pay a year’s tax on them to the Nejd collectors. Again some Beni Sakhr were recently camped at Hasim. A flock of camels belonging to them was grazing near the frontier, when the Nejd soldiers arrived and demanded a year's tax. Ibn Zeid replied that the tax collectors were not under him ani that he was unaware of these incidents. I then protested against the hostile language used by the Nejd detachments in regard both to the English and to Trans-Jordan, and pointed out that such statements, made in public before ignorant tribesmen were calculated to injure the public peace. Ibn Zeid replied that such reports must be incorrect, as the Nejd Authorities were inspired by only the most cordial sentiments. I then informed him that 1 had heard that the Nejd Authorities expend certain sums on spi3s, and moreover that many travellers from Kaf have informed us, that, on crossing from Trans-Jordan, they are closely cross-questioned regarding the progress of the Baghdad Railway and Pipe Line, and the strength of the desert Police. I said that I regretted to see good money wastea on soies, who usually lie, but that if there was anything hehe wanted to know, I could probably give him better reports than the spies, and that in view of the genuine affection in which 1 held him, I should be truly gratified if I could thereby be the cause of his gaining any Kudos with Ibn Saoud. He assured me that such matters did not come within the sphere of his duties. 1 then referred to the cases of la*si, a native of the Qaraiyat and Hajjaj, a Jaufi, who had been removed to an unknown destination in chains on a charge of being spies in my employment. He replied that hJi was fully aware that the British Government was not in need of such persons to further its policy. The emphasis on the fact that he himself was aware seemed to contain an allusion to the ignorance and stupidity of the Governors of Kaf and Jauf, who are deadly jealous of Ibn Beid. bath of them have the spy mania on the brain. Ibn Zeid was suffering from a touch of malaria, which he has had on and off for 9 months. 1 was able to give hira a supply of quinine, with directions i:)r use. There is of course no doctor in Kaf or Jauf. Before parting, I suggested that we hold more frequent meetings in future, as 6 months had elapsed since we met last, fe agreed provisionally to meet again at the end of Ramadhan (say mid-February). In conclusion, I said that I would like to be permitted to express my regret at the fact that no punishment had been inflicted on the Sherarat who raided the Atoon but that on the contrary the Nejd Government was leaving no stone unturned to allow them to keep a large part of the loot. Quite apart from the losses of Atoon, such action was not calculated to secure the obj iot which we had both laboured so heavily to encompass, a cessation ofof frontier raiding. He replied that it was quite true that the raiders had not been punished, but the reason was that they had only raided after their camels had been looted from them. To this I answered:- (a) That if this principle were admitted, raiding would never cease. Every raider always claimed that his action was merely a reprisal for some former raid on himself. (b) Secondly that the 25 camels raided from the Sherarat had been taken by Billi, a Hedjas tribe subject to Ibn Saoud, wnereas the Sherarat had retorted by raiding the Howeitat, subjects of Trans-Jordan. One other point I wished to mention. He said that the Amir of Jauf had kept H about 40 camels 1 * as 'araif'. Had the Amir of Jauf still got forty camels alive? Ibn Zeid replied that he did not know how many were still alive. This was the number taken by the Amir last October. I pointed out that caraels, kept in this maniier under 'Government supervision in charge of paid herdsmen, who had no interest in them, usually died like flies. 1 had asked Ibn Z.eid to meet me last October and he had only replied 3 months later. I could not but consider the Mejd Government responsible for any camels which might have died. fie parted cordially. I really have quite a liking for Ibn Seid, but he had a hopeless case to defend, and yet was undoubtedly not empowered to depart from his instructions or make concessions. I sincerely trust that We have the course taken by me will meet with approval, a perfectly concrete case, but if Ibn Sand is beaten m argument, he just won’t play. (Ogd) J.3, GLUBB.mm. ALC/50/6. » ■» The British Resident, Amman. ix&amp;lasurg-JJJL. Jamtarr i G / . v ) GTH IBM ZEiD QH 7.1.1932. I beg to report that is Seim Glubb Bey met Ibn Seid at Thamilat Husaida, a point on the Frontier on 7.1.32. iaeh entertained the other to a meal and the proceeding were amicable, though unfortunately the attitude of Ibn Seid precluded any possibility of an agreement which would have been fair to Transjordan Tribes. The meetings are useful in suite of the fact that Ibn Seid is given very precise instructions as to •« what he may say, and consequently is unable to express any opinion of his own, when there is any divergence from the line which he has been told to take; For this reason cases have always to be left outstanding till the next meeting, in order that he may obtain fresh instructions. The first subject mooted was the raid on the ^toon, Ibn Beid saying that the Emir of Jauf had dealt with the case but that he believed that 125 camels had been looted, of s?hieh 70 had been returned to owners, 45 kept at Jauf as ^ABAIF” (or camels recognised as belonging to another tribe), and 10 commission taken by soldiers. At a previous meeting it had been verbally agreed that 'ABAIF' should not he seised and this was the suggestion of the MacDonnell Arbitration as regards all camels taken uo to 1.8.30.; and it was subsequently agreed byby Glubb Bey and Ib|t Seid that loot taken after 17th Janaary, 1931, should be at once returned. Thus the only lent governed by the Glubb Ibn Zeid agreement re 'AR IF* is that taken between Au;just 1930 and 17th January, 1931. Ibn Zeid, however, after confirming the original agreement re 'aRAIF” said that it did not cover Araif brought in as loot, but admitted that neither Government had the right to seize ”Araif f1 found in camps or caravans. . It was impossible to agree to Ibn Zeid f s contention, as the very last type of 'Araif s which ought to be permtted is that brought illegally as loot. Ibn Zeid replied by citing &amp; precedent for his contention;- That before returning the loot taken by the Howeitat in January 1931, the Arab Legion had taken one camel 'Aralf'. This was admitted, but as it took place before the agreement with Ibp Zeid re 'Araif', ibn Zeid had to drop his case. The meeting for that day then ended. The next day in order to try and arrange matters, Glubb Bey decided tomive the agreement re 'Araif', in regard to the Atoon case, and informed Ibn Zeid that he would do so, on condition that, in accordance with an agreement made at a nrevious meeting, Ibn Zeid agreed to him bringing the plaintiffs before Ibn ^eid and himself in order tha^they might establish by witnesses or oath that each of the camels in question had been either raided before 1st August 1930, or not rrided at all, or anyhow not subsequent to 1.8.31. This Ibn Zeid refused to agree to, but offered to bring the raiders to establish by witnesses or oath that the camels in question had been raided from them after 1st August, 1930. It was then explained that this was contrary to Bedwin Custom, es if the plaintiff brings satisfac o y witnesses the case oes to him, and anyhow the benefit of anyany doubt should be given to the *Atoon, who had done no wrong while the Shararat had, having raided, Ibn ^eid refused to alter his contention and further agreement being useless the proposal to waive the concession re 'A-raif' was withdrawn. Ibn Zeid then tried to bring up the question of loot taken between 1st August, 1930 and IVth January, 1931 but was informed that it was hopeless trying to arrange matters which happened 18 months afeo when loot taken in a raid which occurred 3 months ago could not be recovered. Ibn Zeid then asked about 10 camels which the Beni Atiya had raided from the Ansibeh and which were captured by the Arab Legion while on their way to be sold in Palestine; he was informed that this matter would settle itself, when the Atoon camels were returned; he at once dropped the matter. Other matters complained of to Ibn Seid were:- (a) The taxing of Transjordan Tribes in the 'iadi birhan. (b) A man of man, who lost 5 camels which were taken to the Wadi birhan by the finder, had to pay a year's taxes on them before being allowed to take them away. (e) borne Beni Sukhr camels from an encampment at Hazim were grazing near the frontier when two Sejdi soldiers came and demanded a year’s taxes in advance. Ibn Zeid declared that he had no knowledge of these matters as tax collectors were not under him. A protest was lodged at the insuiting language used by Nejdi Officials against both the 1 nglish and Trans Jordanians to which Ibn Zeid said the reports must be untrue, the Nejd Officia s being insnired by most cordial sentiments, towards Great Britain and Transjordan.It was then Dointed out that the Sherarat had not heen punished for raiding, but Ibn Said’s rep y was to admit this and then make a futile excuse. * The last point brought out was that the Emir of Jauf had still got 40 of the ’itoon camels and that in spite of requests three months ago for a meeting with Ibn Zeid, yet the meeting had only now taken place, the Kejd Government were therefore entirely responsible if any of the camels died; no reply was given. The mee. ing ended most cordially, Glubb Bey giving Ibn Zeid a few quinine tablets to help cure him of the malaria from'which he has suffered for several months. 1 consider that Glubb Bey’s efforts to bring this meeting to a successful end are most praiseworthy, but the task of negotiating with a man who is given no powers, except to express the opinions of a master 1000 miles away, who cannot know the facts of each case, do not militate towards success.

Ryan had suggested such a visit, independently of the A tun question. The idea was originally mooted when he was on leave. As the Atun question has become so complex, it was agreed that the proposed visit should be expedited, in Older that Wauchope and Ryan might discuss it personally as soon as possible and, it is hoped, submit agreed recommendations as to pursuing the matter with the Hejaz-Nedd Government.

Your ilxcellenoy. In continuation of iay letters Ho.ai/l3 of the 13th g the 17th and the 35th of Ho?ember, 1931 f aealing with the very serious situation which has arisen on account of the action of the Hejdian officials in regard to the raid by the Sherarat on 38*9.31, I have the honour to forward a further memorandum from Gap tain (xlubb, together with a covering letter from Ucut.Colonel Peake, dealing with this subject. In my letter of the 13th Movmber above referred to I requested that pressure in regard to this deplorable ease might immediately be brought to bear on Ibn Baoud. Up to the moment of writing I have no evidence that any action at all has so far been taken in Your kaellency f s office on this urgent request and venture respectfully to point out that this delay is most unfortunate. 3. It will be remembered that for two years before the crushing raid which was carried out by iejd against the Trans-Jordan Zebn in February 1928, raiding had practically ceased on both sides, and it will be re collected that in spite of repeated warnings that if His Majesty 1 ® Government did not take strong action to compel Ibn daoud to return the loot taken mi ding would again break out on an unprecedented scale. His Majesty’s Government, however, was not to be moved by Bis jlxoellencj The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, Jerusalem. my fJ/y1 i i 'i (I of) my warnings and protests Taut merely contented herself by having Ibn Saoud informed that she confidently looked to him to have justice done. As I had foreseen Ibn Saoud in default of the application of pressure returned nothing and, from the time of the raid referred to above till Oaptain Glubb got the situation in hand shortly after his arrival in Trans-Jordan a year ago, raiding has been imeeasing. His Majesty 1 s Grovernment has spent thousands of pounds on the wrong lines trying to prevent it and many Trans jordan tribesmen have been reduced to starvation. 4. I do not consider that Captain Olubb in his memorandum exaggerates the situation and I whole heartedly support him. 5. I regsfrd it as my duty to solemnly warn Your Excellency that unless full and proper restitution is at once made by Hejd of the animals looted by the Sherarat of the EBth September the situation in regard to raiding will go entirely out of hand and British prestige amongst the Arabs will be trampien in the dust. 6. I request that this matter may be brought to Your Excellency’s personal notice and that lour Excellency will immediately urge His Majesty’s Oovernment to direct the Minister at Jeddah to cieiiiand immediate restitution in the very strongest terms; I would suggest that Ibn Idaoud should oe informed that in default of compliance with this demand His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah will be withdrawn. Y. It is essential that there should be no further delay and I therefore request that action should be taken telegraphically. I have, etc., (Signed) fl.H*F.Cox. BRITISH KESID1HT..410/50/^. My dear Uoz # ItevmUr 29, 1931, I herewith send you a long letter from Captain Glubb# (a) I m firmly of opinion that the lack of really strong protests fro fa His Majesty’s Government is not conducive to pease on the frontier. (b) (kpt.Crlubb has done all that man can do in preventing our tribes from raiding, but this cannot go on; if he is not to be supported by H.M.G., then all the work he has put in during the last year will be destroyed. (c) dealings with Ibn Saotid are not like dealings with the French Governor of Jebel druse. The latter gentleman has been brou^t up on civilised lines, while Ibn Saoud has not, if he can gain his ends by lying stealing and murdering he will not hesitate to do so. (d) There is little doubt that a really strong protest from H.U.G. will produce a packet of lies from this Monarch, because he has always found that in the end they are believed, and quite likely he does not know the truth and has no means of finding it out except through his lieutenants; H.M.G. however may rely on this fact:- that lap tain Glubb and the British Autho rities here are not lying; before stating that the 4toon lost 192 camels,every possible means was taken to verify the truth; H.M.G. will, therefore, I hope listen to the statements of her British Officials here, rather than to the protests of Ibn Saoud, which can only be founded on information given him by his Lieutenants in Jof; who have every reason to hide the truth in order to cover their own and their soldiers thieving activities.

I beg to draw jour attention to the serious situation which has arisen on the Hejd Frontier* About a year ago, I wrote a memorandum {shortly after my arrival in frans-Jordan) explaining the tragic condition of the Howeitat, many of whom were literally starving as the result of past raids by Hejd* My statements re garding the poverty of the Howeitat, were, in some quarters, severely queried* Th&amp; result of the laeJonnell investigation into lejd frans-Jordan raids prior to August 1st*, 1930, has since fully confirmed all that 1 have said. Mr*IacDonnell estimated that, after balancing the loot taken by both sides, the fpns-Jordan tribes, on raids up to August 1st*, 1930, were net losers to the extent of:~ 3,66^ camels, 5,370 sheep, £. 1,030 in cash. If anything, I believe this to be a conservative estimate. In the period from 1st August, 1930 to 1st February, 1931,the Howeitat lost about SCO camels and raided about 150 to 300,let us say a further net loss of 400 camels In the last raid at ledowara,ihey lost 193,and IB, have been returned, a further net loss of 174 camels. On the total therefore, the Trans-Jordan Be did ns» in about 5 years, have suffered a net loss to iijd of about 4,236 oamelE, afid 5270 sheep. The average Beduin family can live on 20 to 25 oamels, or.alternatively,on 200 sheep. This loss is, therefore, equivalent to the reductionreduotion of about 185 to 225 beduin families to complete destitution. Beduin famly which owns 20 to 25 camels owns nothing else in the world. for the past year,I have struggled my best to mitigate the miseries of the victims of these past raids. Over and above the Sx^eoial Service Funds at my disposal, I have given away between £500 and £600 out of my own pocket, which I have distributed in varying bums from a few piastres upwards to families obviously suffering from acute hunger and distress. It is, however, impossible to continue in this manner. Hot only so, but I am now informed that my Special Service Funds have been reduced by £500 for economy. I need only say that I v?ould not have expended over £500 from my own pocket, if the funds allotted to me were in excess of the needs of the situa tion. By these distributions of charity and by severe punishments of all raiders or thieves, the thieves, the frans^lordan tribes have been, 1 think I may say for the first time in history, definitely prevented from raiding, and this in spite of their unparalleled poverty, which would naturally impel them to raid more than ever. In return for all these efforts, I have been made the subject of venomous attacks in the Palestine Press for alleged severities in reprossing raid© by Trans jordan tribes. it the same time, nothing has been gained with the Mejd Authorities. While the raids of which they previously complained have now been completely stopped,! have nevertheless been equally venomously attacked in I bn 3aud f s newspapers, and in repeated despatches from his to His Majesty 1 s Government. The She r ami: - r £h© principal raiders on the lejd sideBide have, in tha past, been the ohararat. This tribe, formerly despised and oppressed by all, has been delibe rately strengthened, pampered and assisted by the liejd OoveriMent, in order to make them into a kind of irregular militia on the frontier. In winter, the tribe graces near Jauf in Hejd territory,but in suiamer they enter or approach the boundary of Trans-Jordan, and the numerous caravans of their tribe are obliged to visit the Trans jordan towns to buy supplies. % the end of August, they have finished their work in Trans-Jordan, and in September they normally move down the ladi Sirhan towards Jauf, re turning again in April or May. In Sep timber, 1930 , when they had finished with Trans-Jordan and moved back to Jauf, they immediately raided the Bowel tat, looting no less than 600 camels. Other minor raids continued until the end of Deca&amp;ber. All the loot taken was shared with the Governor of Jauf and the soldiery. In the spring, the Mejd authorities and the Ohara rat assumed a most friendly attitude, frontier meetings were held,and everything appeared most and cable. I must admit that personally I was taken in. Bo sooner, however, had the Shirarat completed their requirements from Trans-Jordan and moved back to Jauf, then they again carried out a large raid, this time looting 200 cartels. $ven then the writer still hoped that the Hejd Authorities would live up to their friendly pro testations made during the summer. He confidently sent the owners to Jauf with letters asking for the return of the loot. The treatment meted out to thera there has been reported elsewhere. Iventually 18 miserable camels were sent in to Medowara. faults :- Hot only has the incident resulted in a further loss of 174 camels to the already well-nigh destitutedestitute Roweitat,(the Atoon were one of the few sections still fairly prosperous) but it has, at one blow, destroyed the work of the past year. The Bowel tat have been prevented from raiding for the past nine months, not only by the severe repressive measures,employed, but by a certain recrudescence of hope, where, a year ago, all was despair. To begin with, the Writer, when he came from Iraq., had a certain reputation. Secondly, for the past ten months they had not been raided by Mejd, while he had assisted them to some extent also (in part from his private means) to keep body and soul alive. The recent incident destroyed all this moral edifice at a stroke. The Nejd tribes, in collusion with the local authorities, have started the same old game and ^got away with it 51 . Government messengers sent to Ja#f were abused, placed under an armed guard, and summarily evicted from the town, amidst the jeers of the Sherarat. Since their return, the writer has been everywhere beseiged by hostile and indignant Beduins, asking what he is going to do about it and if the English are again going to take it lying down. The Writer has frequently explained before that the only way to stop raiding is to give our own subjects a fair deal. If we do not allow them to raid,we must protect them from being raided. The whole matter is one of prestige. The reason why we have had and will have continual troubles in these deserts is because the prestige of His Majesty f s Government (and now of myself )is nil.

In the meritaime Glubb has sent letters and owners of looted animals to Jauf and Tabuk to recover their losses but only 18 animals have been restored, Xbn &amp;eid in his reply contended that large percen* tags of camels are not returnable on ground that they were previously looted by Moweit&amp;t irom dherarat. Thi® contention is inaceoptable though these animals were in fact looted from herarat by Howeitat they were looted before August 1st, 1930 and therefore under Macdonnell award as accepted by Xbn daud they became property of lioweitat, Tha Smir Jaaf states that remaining camels hare been given to his men for services rendered in their recovery from raiders, the raided section of Howeitat is destitute and unless Xbn Saud stands by Macdonnell award and restitution in full British prestige will suffer most seriously sad raiding will again get beyond control.

I added that I was glad to have an o portunity at last of giving him face to face a full reply to the allegations of June 3rd, as it offered a more satisfactory method of disposing of incidents, which should now be regarded as closed, than would a written rejoinder, to which he could haruly have forborne to add further correspondence. I then read to him enough of Captain Glubb’s report of June 14th to answer all the allegations and to meet his further questioning without having to touch upon the details about which I was still awaiting information. I concluded by stating that I was averse to further discussion of the oast when our efforts should be directed to present and future co-operation. 3. ■ Ml is majesty's irincipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.dm In this I was only partially successful* although Fuad Bey had nothing further to say about Captain Glubb’s alleged delay in meeting Ibn &amp;eyd, or about the so-called salt caravan, or about the camels of Mis 'ad al Faqir and the luulla, he fastened upon the four camels of Ibn da * dana * s uncle and maintained that, in spite of what he might perhaps be prepared to regard as exceptional circumstances, their sequestration by Captain Glubb proved his Government's contention that this officer w;is addicted to high-handed action. He denied that anything similar could be adduced against hejdi officials and asked whether His Majesty's Government condoned or supported such action. !o this I replied that it was a point which seemed hardly worth making or considering, in view of such exceptional circumstances I and so on ridiculously siaall a basis, ks a matter fact. His Majesty's Government nad not instructed me to convey any judgment on ttttfi matter, but merely to acquaint his government with the full facts for their information. 4. I am afraid that Fuad Bey will try to make further capital out of this small incident. He is by litigious and probably feels, moreover, that in Ibn sa'Sd's absence it is uo to him to give away no opportunity of cramping Captain Giubb'e style.

Dear Mr. Hope Gill, A short time ago I asked you as I have already asked Sir Andrew Ryan whether you have received any information about the first meeting of Captain Glubb and Sheikh f Abdul f Aziz so that you can discuss the same with me with a view to mutually understanding the points to which they have reached. As I understand that both parties are doing their utmost to get a good way which assures in iuture the existence of everything which perpetuates safety and peace on the frontiers, I shall be grateiul it you will be good enough to inform me the time when you will be able to discuss the same. With highest respects, (Signed) FUAD HAMZA..2099/210/257 . British Legation, Jedda, August 9th, 193].. Dear Fuad Bey, I am so sorry to have been so long in answering your letter of August 1st. It only came before ray eyes yesterday, having lain hidden in a hillock of papers with which I have been dealing recently. Yes, I have now received information about the preliminary meeting of Glubb with Sheykh 1 Abdul ’Aziz on June 3rd. The meeting seems to have been thoroughly cordial and a number of practical subjects were discussed, as you of course know, but without any decisions being taken, as the Sheykh had not by then received the instructions referred to in His Royal Highness' Note No. 7/2/49 of the 5th Safer (June 21) and your letter to Sir Andrew No.7/2/52 of the 6th Safer (June 22). I am of course always pleased to have an opportunity of discussing things with Your Excellency, hut I do not really see how we can advance matters here by discussing what was merely an exchange of views at the preliminary meeting. The main meeting is the thing, and as its terms of reference have already been so fully discussed and settled, I hope that we can now leave it to the two frontier representatives to carry on. You remember that this was the view communicated by Sir Andrew in paragraph 3 of his Note No. 116 of June 18th and acknowledged by His Royal Inghneso Safar. However, if Your Excellency particularly wishes to talk things over, lam ready at any time, here or elsewhere. Have you any news Excellency Yours Puad Bey Hamza. of the main meetings' sincerely, 0. G. HOPE GILL*copy :907/387/25) 356. Jedda. 4th September, 1931. My Lord, In a series of conversations on September 1st to 3rd the Hejazi Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs made a determined attempt to introduce a discussion of additional principles by which the series of meetings now, supposedly, being held between Captain G-lubb and Ibn Zeyd for the settlement of past raids should be controlled. 2 . In my despatch No. 330 of August 10th I transmitted copies of an exchange of private letters, in which Fuad Bey expressed the wish to discuss the results of the preliminary meeting of June 3rd, and in which I demurred to the suggestion as unlikely to advance matters, preferring to leave the two frontier representatives full liberty to continue to meet under the terms of reference already so fully discussed and settled. 3. Without referring to my reply, Fuad Bey stated that the main meeting having taken place (on August 15th I gathered), it was now necessary to agree as between Governments upon a number of guiding principles without which their frontier representatives would be unable to proceed. I expressed astonishment that he should try to introduce still more principles after the long and detailed exchange of views which took place in March, April and May and concluded with the exchange of Notes in June recording complete agreement on all the principles which were to govern the main meeting. Fuad Bey Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Bey stuck to his point and insisted that it was useless for Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeyd to meet again until the Hejazi and British Governments had agreed upon such matters as methods of inter-communication on the frontier, the scale of 'diya' or blood-money payable, and the percentage commission on loot retainable by the authorities on either side. I maintained that these were details which concerned the two representatives and refused to admit that they must be discussed with him as matters of principle, without specific instructions from Your Lordship. 4. At length, at our third meeting, I had to take Fuad Bey unwillingly step by step through the whole of the past negotiations before he would admit that the principles governing the frontier representatives* meeting for the settlement of past raids must be regarded as fully discussed and definitely fixed. He thereupon made the point that the main meeting had now taken place, and that the establishment of further principles was therefore not only permissible but . essential. After more argument I secured his sudden admission that the ’’main meeting” must necessarily be a series of meetings in order to dispose of all the raiding since 1st August, 1930 and that the whole series fell under the terms of reference already established. If, he added, I had understood him to say anything different, I had misunderstood him. All he wanted to do was to seek agreement on the principles of future co-operation on both sides of the frontier, such as methods of inter-communication, ”diya” etc. 5. I accepted his volte-face with the remarm that I still considered these to be matters of detail properly lying within the sphere of the two representatives on the spot, but that providedprovided the present series of meetings was not interrupted by consideration of them, I could not refuse to transmit his Government’s views on them for instructions. Fuad Bey preferred to put them in writing on his return to Taif. 6. I ha^e reported the incident at some length because it shows the extreme to which Fuad Bey conceived himself to be driven in order to retain as much control as possible in the hands of the central Government, and to leave as little freedom as possible to the frontier representatives. But throughout the discussions he made great play of his desire to eliminate every possible source of misunderstanding between our two Governments. 7.

The tribe moved before dawn next morning nnd re entered Trans-Jordan territory near Had!the.

Yet Your Excellency must surely he aware of the repeatedly and clearly expressed Intention of my Government that the proclamations against raiding should apply to all raids at all times and not merely to the period of the meeting. I would refer you particularly to paragraph 2 of the British memorandum of April 18th. Moreover, as Sir Andrew reminded you on July 7th, when you discussed with him this and one or two other matter© connected with the Trans-Jordan frontier, It was agreed after © definite ©xhhange of views that the proclamations of His Majesty King Ihn Ba’ud and the Amir Abdullah should apply to all raiding at all times and not merely during the Glubb—ihn Zwyd meetiiig. proclamations alone will not of course stop raiding* ihat must be effected by the measures t ken on both sides of the frontier and their coordination a@ a result of the cooperation between local authorities contemplated in Article S ox- the -aclda Agreement.

It is presumed that ob lection of Amir to a direct agreement between Governments of Trans-Jordsn and Hejaz-Nsjd is a result of his unwillingness to recognise Ibn Saud. Hie Majesty's Government do not desire unduly to press Amir in this matter; they therefore suggest that as a oompromise the agreement should take a form similar to that of the Bahra agreement of 1925, that is that it should be signed by (a) representatives of Hejas-Neji and (b) British plenipotentiary empowered to sign on behalf of Trans-Jordan Government. The correot course would in that ease app-aer t 0 he that Sir A.Ryan should negotiate and sign as plenipotentiary, Kirkbriie merely noting as his expert adviser.

The raiders killed two men of the Demaniya and made off with a number of camels ishich were, however, subsequently recovered by their owners in pursuit of the raiders. This raid will no doubt fall to be included in the settlement to be reached between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn geld.

Sir, I have the honour to request that you will be good enough to lodge a protest with the Hejas Government against a violation of the Hejas-Trans-Jordan Boundary committed by certain of its officials in the following circumstances, 2, About the middle of May, Captain Glubb, who was encamped at Amari, heard that forty camels had been looted from the Trans-Jordan Koweitat by the Syrian Ruallah. He thereupon proceeded east wards into the corridor along the Baghdad track in the hope of recovering the loot before the raiders could escape from Trans-Jordan territory* Near Jabel Htbr, east of landing ground 'H 51 , he was informed by a party of She re ri tribesmen that there was a camp of Nejdian n soldiers' just south of the track, 3 , Captain Glubb found the encampment some 500 yards south of the track. It consisted of six Nejdis under the leadership of Abdul Karim Itm Zeld, a nephew of Sheikh Abdul Asis Ibn 'eid, who explained that he had come from Kaf to see the Sherarat, asserting that he knew nothing of any raid, nor was in possession of any stolen camels. Captain Glubb pointed out that he and his men were within His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah.within Trans-Jordan territory and they roust leave it by the following rooming. This request was carried out. 4 . After the departure of the He.jdis, however, the Bherari Sheikh informed Captain Olubb that on the night preceding Captain Glub^s arrival a party of Syrian Huai 1 ah with I 40 camels, which they had looted from Jebel Druse tribes and from the Trans*Jordan Howe it at, came into the Sherari camp, thinking it was their own, and were seized. The Sherari Sheikh had then reported the seizure to the Nejdian official at Kaf who had sent Abdel Karim Ibn Zeid to take charge of the situation. 5 . The Sherari Sheikh further stated that at the very time of Captain Glubb^ arrival, the stolen camels were grazing a short distance to the south of the Nejdian camp and Abdel Karim Ibn Seid had sent an order to their guardians that the camels were at once to be sent off into Hejd territory, threatening severe punishment to anyone who should Inform Captain G-lubb of what was happening. 6 . I shall be grateful If in registering a protest with the Hejaz Government you will urge that instructions be given to the officials concerned which will prevent a recurrence of trespasses of this kind. The present incident is particularly regrettable in that both the Syrian Authorities and the Jebel Druze tribes attribute the loss of h the I ■ ''3 V ithe Syrian camels to raiders from Trans-Jordan, and a recent series of raids into Trans-Jordan by the Jebel Druse tribes probably marks this belief.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No .57 of the 13 th May, 1931* regarding the protest lodged by the Hejas Minister for Foreign Affairs against a further raid said to have been carried out by a party of Ho we it at against Hindi bin Shahbi al Balwi on the 3^d April, 1931 1 at a place between al Beda and Afal. 2. As a result of enquiries carried out in the Aqaba District, the British Resident, Amman, has ascertained the following facts with regard to this incident. Early in April, a party of the Howeitai el Tihama, a tribe, and some of the Amran tribe, set out from the Wadi Afal in the He jar, under the leadership of Hhinhin ©1 Howeiti, Hhayed Ibn Salim, Joma‘ el l^eily and Miqbil Ibn Salman, all members of the Howeitat el Tihama, to raid the Bill! tribes. Before attaining their objective, however, the raiders fell in with the camels of Hindi Ibn Shahbi and drove them off. Ibn Shahbi and his tribesmen followed the raiders at onoe and, in I;' the j| ■ i, His Majesty's Minister, Jeddah.th© fight which ensued, Ibn Shahbi was killed and two of his followers were wounded. Among the raiders, Bnayed Ibn Salim was wounded but the remainder escaped in the direction of Wadi Afal, taking with them four thoroughbred camels. The rest were recaptured by thoir owners. p. It would appear therefore, that both the raiders and the victims in this case are inhabitants of the Hejas, and that the raid took place in Hejaz territory. In the circumstances, I suggest that the Tr@ns-Jordan Government are not called upon to accept any responsibility in the matter.

During- his Speech from the Throne on the occasion of the opening of the second Legislative Council at Amman, the Amir Abdullah referred pointedly to the efforts now being made to establish peace between the tribes of Trans jordan and the tribes of Xajd. At the beginning of this month it was announced that a meeting was being held at Wadi Sirhan between Captain J. B. Glubb, representing the Government of Trans-Jordan, and Shaikh Abdul Aziz ibn Zaid, Inspector of Tribes in Najd and the Hijaz. At this meeting were to be discussed all claims arising- from raids which had occurred' between Trans-Jordan and Najd since August i, 1930, and an attempt was to be made not only finally to settle them, but also to set up some machinery between the Trans-Jordan authorities and the authorities of the Hijaz-Najd for the future prohibiting of raids. As a preliminary to this meeting, the Amir Abdullah forbade all raids by the tribes of Trans-Jordan, and King Ibn Saoud acted similarly towards his tribes. This step represented a considerable improvement in pro cedure. The last conference held at Amman, under the presidency of Mr. MacDonnell, to deal with this problem was, it may be recalled, actually interrupted by raids. These raids do not appear to have decreased greatly in importance, and the seriousness of the situation of some of the Trans-Jordan tribes, in particular, is often incom pletely realised. The respective representatives at this Wadi Sirhan conference may be fully trusted as sincere exponents of particular p lints of view : the experience of Captain Glubb in the Southern Desert of Iraq, especially, must be an asset of the greatest value to the Government of Trans-Jordan. There is no reason to suspect that either side is not profoundly desirous of peace in the desert. Misunderstandings of late have been frequent enough, but the opportunity now exists, and we hope that it will not be allowed to slip, of liquidation of the unhappy past and of provision for a better regulated future.**» 'r . , ft In any further oommu^cation on this subject, j^ease quote and address —not to atyy^person pj name, put to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

Fuad 'Ley was good enough to communicate to me on Hay 28th a draft formula embodying in a definite form the proposal of the $tfwt&amp; Government in this respect. i. immediately cofiimunicated the formula proposed by .Fuad . ey to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who had already received certain explanations from the Kej&amp;s-Iejd Mnlster in London on the subject* My Government consider that Fuad bey 1 e formula goes further than what ms originally inten ded. they appreciate the desire of His Majesty King Abdul-A sis to maintain His authority over hi© subjects in the event of their disobeying a summons to attend for the purpose of giving evidence but they regard the proposed undertaking a© being clearly intended only to apply to Sheikhs who may floe Into the territory of the other party as u direct consequence of being/ Minister for Foreign Affairs, MECCA. r breing et*Ilea on to appear or give evidence* Government suggest that this object would be attained by substituting the following words for those proposed by Fuad bey in the latter portion of the draft formula:- Subject to the condition that if one of these Sheikhs w should refuse to obey the orders of his Government to •appear or to give evidence before the representatives and } *should attempt to take refuge in the country of which he J, is not a national, the Government of that country will do ”everything in its power to apprehend and hand Mm over to 'his own Government.' My Government share the desire of the Hujasi Government that the one remaining obstacle to the main meeting between Sheikh Abdul-Asis and Captain Glu * should be removed as soon as possible* They have instructed me to make ©very effort to secure acceptance of the above proposal, which they have put forward after most carefully considering the matter in all its aspects.

They consider it goes further than what was originally Intended. They appreciate the King's desire to main tain authority over subjects in the event of dis obedience to summons but they regard proposed under taking as being clearly intended to apply only to Sheikhs fleeing as direct consequence of being called on to appear or give evidence. His Majesty's Government consider this object would be attained by substituting words for latter portion of Fuad’s formula (here insert redraft in your telegram No. 95). His Majesty's Government share desire of Hejaz Government that the one remaining obstacle to main meeting should be removed.

Note from Minister for Foreign Affairs of June 3rd, written without reference to previous correspondence, reproduces sinister information which if verified will greatly tend to destroy hopes enter tained in connexion v/ith the frontier cjiestion. Minister for Foreign Affairs reminds me of Fuad’s observations in recent conversations regarding the unfavourable effect of delay in publishing the Transjordan' proclamation and Glubb’s delay in meeting Ibn Zeid, but says the effect of these delays, however great, is weak compa-red with that of the action reported to have been taken by Glubb as follows:- 1. In November or December certain Beni Sakhr tribesmen looted 18 camels from Ibn Saadina but returned them. While he was returning with the camels Glubb met and detained him but he escaped on a camel belonging to Ibn Jazi whose gun he also took. Glubb later captured a Shararat caravan, including women s consisting of 18 camels carrying salt on the pretext of retaliation for Ibn jazi’s camels and gun. 2. Musaad el Faciir and party were recently moving west towards Hazim to obtain restitution of the camels held in Transjordania. Glubb detained him and2 and the camels dy way t£ compensation for the camels alleged to have been looted by A1 Awazi from A1 Atwat in the past, 3. It is also reported that Glubb seized 40 camels fr#m Daraan of Ru j.la by way of compensation^ he said, for the camels belonging to Abu Rukab al Sharari wh^ resides v/ith Beni Sakhr, Remainder of the note consists of comments in the usual vein on the danger of the joint efforts of the governments being compromised by local activities which manifest evil intention and which moreover prove the truth of the earlier contention regarding !! Glubb 1 s object in exciting the Bedouin and declaring to them that there is no one who can protect them against him neither Ibn Baud nor anyone else'. Minister for Foreign Affairs requests His Majesty’s Government to take immediate measures to restrain such activities and asks for very early reply but adds that the incidents do net affect arrangements for the meeting for which Ibn ZeiG has been waiting at Qariat for over a month* ('R” ends). Incidents at 1 and 2 appear to be connected with those dealt with in Transjordan despatches to me numbered C.F/735/29 of April 18th and April 9th action on which I postponed for reasons stated in my telegram to Transjordan No. 158. Informati on con tained in them does not suffice to dispose of present accusation. I cannot connect incident at 3 with anything previous. Ibn Baud’s3. Ita Baud’s hostility towards GluTih remains unabated. I fear ( 1 gp. undec.) in his general attitude unless means can be found to expedite main meeting success of which is most doubtful hut which will be at least ®pen to new phase.

Transjordan- Hejaz-Nejd frontier situation). formula in my telegram No.95 (of June 2nd), which was carefully devised to meet numerous difficulties from various quarters was intended to cover all cases in which Hejaz-Nejd Sheikhs might attempt to flout Ihn Saud’s authority in connexion with, or as result of his orders that they should attend and give evidence. It should therefore meet the King’s anxiety lest compliance with His Majesty's Government's desire ior attendance of witnesses should impair his authority over his own subjects. Cases of attempted flight after evidence had been given could only be covered however if it could be shown that flight followed on disobedience of King's orders in connexion with attendance at meeting. It was particularly desired uo cover as far as possible all such cases connected with meeting, in order that further discussion on general question of fugitive criminal's, which has no direct connexion with question of attendance or attempted escape of witnesses, might proceed independently and not cause further delay in main meeting2 . meeting between Captain Glubb and Ibn Seid. Criterion of nationality seems inevitable, since it would obviously be impossible to surrender or drive back to Nejd Sheikhs who could prove that they were of Syrian or Iraqi allegiance. It was adopted in order to avoid vague phrases to which so much exception has been taken, and I trust that you may succeed in getting Hejazi government to accept it without having to embark on further detailed explanations. In these circumstances you should present revised formula forthwith; unless you feel strongly that it is unsuitable when I will at once consider alternative,provided you can devise one which will meet objections from other quarters, as I realise danger of further prolongation of discussion, Addressed to uedda no.98, repeated to Transj ordan No.76.1 '» In any further com munition, on this subject, pldkse quote ^ n °- ^ and address —not to any person by name, bfyt to- “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. x FQ~y j THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presepta to compliments to ju and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copffj of the under-mentioned paper.

Nevertheless Ihn Saud sees frontier situation as a whole. Owing probably to internal difficulties described in other reports he now seems anxious for settlement all along the line which has also been aim pursued by His Majesty’s Government during the past year. King is however suspicious and considers certain requirements essential. One of these is that nothing should impair his authority over his own subjects. This underlay his attitude regarding witnesses. He has consented under pressue to their being heard joint ly when their evidence is necessary but in note summar ised in my telegram No.131 he emphasised danger of Sheikhs’ respect for Government being diminished and suggested that if personsin possession of loot were forced to attend they might flee. Such flights might be resorted to not only to avoid attendance but also after attendance had been ensured by compulsion if Sheikhs thought they v/ere in danger from their own side as result of enquiry. It2 . It may be argued in the latter alternative they would be in similar position to fugitive criminals. This argument is unlikely to satisfy the King. Even if assimilation were complete agreement regarding surrender of criminals is not yet complete. The King's suspicions will be increased by express refer ence to nationality in your re-draft. I had hoped this might be unnecessary in present case although it is important in formula regarding criminals which will have more extended application and must therefore be more guarded. It must be remembered that I am no longer in personal touch with Fuad nor do your instructions allow me any latitude in negotiations. If above considerations appear to you immaterial I will propose re draft in writing but I feel bound to warn you against danger of further prolongation of discussion which may result.

I submit following observations. Point 1. In my conversation with Fuad I endeavoured to follow Instructions in your telegram -O' 87. i a,voided precise definition of words n if possible ejc. on the grounds that eveiy contingency could not be foreseen but I could not avoid all discussion of their meaning. I defended them as being intended to protect Transjordan against obligations of genuine impossibility of fulfilment without defeating main purpose. I gave hypothetical example and (? gr. omitted; later to'possible difficulty of determining nationality. I emphasised fact that such words are generally used in similar connexion. Iu now appears that words have much wider sense than i supposed aid imply in effect 'so far as Power giving undertaking considers compatible with its conception of law and humanity'. Even if they have thisthis effect to general totemational usage It Is not Ibn Saud's understanding of them. if j pursue discussion with this res™t ion m ™ , i- ^c j., /dij iosn in rry mind but without giving any indication of it any subsequent attempt to give effect « it will expose me and Perhaps H1 S Majesty's Government to accusation of having bean disingenuous. m ny opinion only safe and defensible alterna tives are to use plainer language in the text or to state frankly to discussions that to spite of what I told Fuad words are to fact ve^ elastic and cover wide range of contingencies of all kinds which cannot e indicated beforehand. This would probably render agreement impossible which might not be a bad thing. Point 2. it is clear that you do not wish me to ®i-g 0 es J that ibn Send cannot be trusted to treat his ° m “I*. I must however offer som explanation of refusal to agree to surrender to case suggested by Riad.

Fuad agreed° I said if this were understood between us I would not ask for further definition of that word but I pressed strongly for in sertion after 'undertakes' of words 'to do everything in their power.'

Hi view of length and nature of frontier end limited range of forces available, it is impracticable for Transjordan authorities to give unqualified undertaking. Moreover exceptional case might occur wnere it would be impossible for Transjordan auohonties to refuse asylum for example on legal or humanitarian grounds. it is therefore undesirable, as explained in my telegram No. 87 (of I$ay 21st), to attempt to define position more closely, and it is essential that full measure of freedom allowed by present formula should be retained. You may, however, bearing these considerations in mind, discuss with Hejazi Government drafting amendments, which should be submitted to me for consideration of His Majesty's Government and Transjordan authorities. iumo 2 is an extension of original Hejazi request, and is open to serious objection. Apart xrom practical difficulties involved in capture, retention in custody, and personal deliveiy of fugitives to Hejaz-Nejd authorities, possibility thatthat captives thus handed over hy British authorities might he subjected to barbarous penalties would be unacceptable to public opinion in this country. You should therefore inform Hejrni Government that this new request cannot be agreed to, emphasising if necessary practical difficulties involved. Point 3. This request is obscure, but appears to amount to wide exten si on of original proposal. It is unlikely that Transjordan authorities would be willing to undertake to capture and surrender raiders caught red-handed in Transjordan territory and thus sacrifice complete freedom to deal with them as circumstances require. You should inform Kejazi Government that this point is not fully understood, but that in any case it appears to involve so great an extension of request which present formula is designed to meet, that it would require mature consideration and should not be allowed to hold up settlement of present formula. Meanwhile you should give no indication of attitude likely to be adopted by Transjordan authorities on this point. Point 4 appears to be met by terms of second sentence of formula.

Fuad stated th p t', „ tne tv/o parts of section 3 of note summarized in ny telegram No. 131 hung together and that intention was to agree to representatives hearing sheikhs jointly in cases where their evidence was required, subject to undertaking that witnesses taking refuge in territory of the other side would be turned bc,ck. I said we had been considering extension of formula regarding raiding criminals to cover this case. Rmd suggested this would delay meeting unnecessarily and proposed separate undertaking in simple terns that any witnesses fleeing during or soon aiter meeting should be surrendered. He is to give me written draft. D. Formula relative to raiding criminals. Fuad, who now seems anxious to clear the way for meeting, agreed that this was a separate question. I asked loiyexplanation of note summarized in my telegram Ino. 145, j eirnipi'npri ± explained v/iunoat giving precise aeiinioion that if words like 'if possible' were not used formula would be so inelastic as to produce &lt;Lnaer ° x CQ£lstailt disputes like that over Ibn l/e.shhur hich Hio iv it ,jeoty' s Government were determined to avoid, ^ed said that object of providing for surrender as alternative to expulsion was to cover cases in which representative authorities were in the position to arrest and hand over particular criminals as well as Cc.ses in which larger bodies could only be driven out tyW pursuit or other measures e.g„ pressure on their om trihos not to harbour thorn. Ke limited point 3 to cdDcb provided for in your draft formula and cases where Hejaz-Nejd subjects flee to Transjordan after committing attacks in Hejaz-Nejd territory on other persons v/nether subjects of either Government or of any third Government. I said that point 4 was expressly covered by your draft subject to words 'if possible', E. I deprecated language of last Hejaz note on alleged violation of Mejd territory by aeroplanes and cars, I said that it was merely offensive to reiterate charges v/hich had been subject of reasoned reply without adducing specific facts. Comments on above. As regards C. Fuad's suggestion is not quite in accord with explanation given by Hejaz Minister in London. 1 agree that question should be kept separate from that of raiding criminals in order to expedite meeting but I consider in case of witnesses also we should avoid any commitment which v/e are not certain of being able to fulfil. As regards D. Fuad’s explanations have reassured me to some extent although I think v/e should insist on reasonable elasticity and I still foresee disputes turning on nationality.

Lest he should think that all was well in a sunny world I remarked that one grave question over-shadowed everything else. He passed this oft, and there has been no mention of the frontier question in any subsequent conversation, although we met on the 5th and 6th March to discuss other things. . I he King and the sheikh would appear to have kept the matter within the smallest possible circle. I have had no indication that anyone outside the .ace and the Legation knows of the crisis. I doubt whether even Mr. Philby m spite of his constant frequentation of the King and his Eminence arise reputation has been told anything important. If he has, he has had the sense to keep it to himself. XT- ^ ai ? 1 ? enc ^ n g copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Maiesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

The King was attended by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who was present throughout, except for short exits to get papers. I was with the mg until about 11-45, and nearly the whole of the time was devoted to the 1 ransj or dan frontier question. r ^ ^ ven Sheikh Yusuf some days before a list of seven matters which wmhed to lay before the King in person. On receipt of my final instructions on tne 1 ransj ordan question, I decided not to detract from its importance by iseussmg other business. I made an exception in favour of the communication ad to make about the Biscoe incident. After compliments, I told the King • fiT wou ^ con fme myself to two subjects, and I disposed of the Biscoe affair in me manner recorded in a separate despatch to the Foreign Office. I then said 1 must turn to a much more difficult matter. o Jr r the King that I had addressed two communications to the Minister or loreign Affairs on the 28th February. I was instructed to see His Majesty [121 gg—3] B2 personally in connexion with both. I reminded him of my personal efforts from the date of my audience with him on the 11th June last up to that of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 3rd February to get the Trans- iordan situation placed on a satisfactory basis. I had made those efforts with the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government and under instructions. They had failed. His^Majesty’s Government had now stated their position in their own language The matter was no longer in my hands, but I was instructed to follow up the two communications in which I had reproduced the views of His Majesty’s Government by seeing the King personally. , ^ nr • 4. The first purpose of this, I explained, was to confirm what His Majesty’s Government had said about Captain Glubb. I presumed that His Majesty had seen my note, and that I need not recapitulate its contents. I emphasised, however, its importance. Most serious accusations had been made by the Hejazi Government against Captain Glubb. He had been charged with circulating false rumours and converting camels belonging to Kejdis to his own use, which might mean his own use or use in connexion with his work. Those accusations did not impair the confidence of His Majesty’s Government in Captain Glubb. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the accusations reflected on themselves, as they had specially chosen Captain Glubb for his task. , 5 My second purpose was even more important. His Majesty s bovern- ment had stated their position explicitly in the memorandum enclosed in my second note. The matter was therefore out of my hands, as I had said, but I had been instructed to supplement the memorandum and had two observations to add. &lt;1 corrected this later by saying that there was a third.) They were these (1) I was to impress on the King the extreme gravity of the situation To use the language of my instructions, I was to do this with all the force of which I was capable. (2) I was to say that His Majesty’s Government wished me to obtain a definite answer before the King left Jedda, and at latest before the evening of the 4th March, i.e., within four days of delivering the memorandum. # (3) I had to add, even at the risk of offending the King s person, that it was universally believed on the frontier that the large-scale raids from Nejd into Transjordan were carried out under his authority. 6. As regards (3), I suggested, with an explanation that what I was about to say was a personal elucidation not covered by my instructions, P 01D J which gave colour to the belief entertained on the frontier. There had been no reply to the British memorandum of last October, but in a later note the c g Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that raiding from Nejd could not D eondemned until raiding from Transjordan had entirely ceased In making y second point, I was hampered by my inability to state that His Majesty s bo ment secretly knew that Ibn Saud had himself instigated the October rai s - was that within a few days of the delivery of the October memorandum, mere had been two great raids into Transjordan, of the imminence oi W * 11C authorities at Jauf had had previous knowledge, as was shown by a teieg from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Legation sent on the day P 11 . the raids actually took place. This warning was too late because of the c irc , route by which it was sent, Jauf—Mecca— Jedda— Jerusalem-Amman, bu i that the authorities of Jauf, knowing of the departure of the raiders, con more easily have rounded them up on their return. The 800 camels these raids were, until recently at any rate, known to be kept close to the Finally, when I had on the 17th February written to Sheikh Yusuf Yasl . . alleged preparations for further raiding, he had written on the day o r , , my letter to say that the report was false. How could so swift a denial, ^ investigation, be given without suggesting that, if the report were &gt; authorities in Mecca would have knowledge of the preparations. 7. I said I had nothing to add except to repeat that the situation ^ of extreme gravity. The King listened patiently and without mterrup ^ the whole of my statement. His reply was not equally consec necessitated discussion on points as they arose. The following acooun ^ passed is based largely on notes taken by Mr. Wikeley, and gives tne g3 ^tlcugl ■S 0?1 |k accitii.

Thinking that he was going to pass my first note off irthtsTayTiXpolaied t ^ Ministers had said a great deal. He said he had not finished what he was about to say. Captain Glubb had started the matter by allegations that the Nejdi authorities were encouraging raids and distributing money Thesl allegations were false. The King rather qualified the express attribution of thlm to Captain Glubb by saying that they were false, whether it was Captain Glubb or anyone else who was responsible for them, and he tried to make out that there was no definite attack on Captain Glubb personally. I pointed out tW categorical accusations had been made in two written communications and by Yusuf Yasm m official conversations with me. ^ 9 -. The King denied that En-Neshmi any longer held any official emnlnv “TiW it SerV1C r He insi f e T d there were ™ preparations for ra“d ng and that the new Governor of Jauf had been ordered to do all in his power to stop it. He had dismissed En-Neshmi some time ago because of the views held regarding him m Transjordan and because he could not work in with the authorities there. As a matter of fact, Neshmi was probably more capable than tte new Governor whom he had sent when he appointed Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin Zeid to his present post. um ' His Majesty said! that he looked to His Majesty’s Government to deal equitably with both sides^ If crimes were committed they should be punished irrespective of side. His Majesty’s Government were much stronger than he was If they sought to rum him or wished to humiliate him, it was not the treatment he expected of old friends. Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd should receTve Sual treatment. He held his subjects as completely as the ring on his finger. q If offenders m Transjordan were punished he was ready to mete out twice the punishment to those on his own side. , i 11 ., Th ^ K } n S sai d that the suggestion that raids were carried out under his authority refiected on him personally. It was, he intimated, false. He was entitled as a King to ask for an explanation of it, and, if it could not be sub stantiated to demand satisfaction. I said that I had not made an accusation but had told him what was believed on the frontier. I stressed the importance ot such a belief being entertained. He said something to the effect that this was not an adequate excuse. I replied that I was making no excuse and repeated that ad made no accusation, but had stated a fact as to what was thought on the rentier. In order to emphasise the point without committing myself too far, l attempted again to develop the considerations stated in paragraph 6 above' When I again mentioned Fuad Bey’s note stating that raids from Nejd could not be condemned unless raids from Transjordan ceased, His Majesty asked whether tnat view was right or wrong. He evidently expected me to admit its justice. I said Wrong! ’ During this portion of the conversation the King drew some sort ot a parallel between the accusations against himself and those against oaptam Glubb. I said that the accusations against Captain Glubb were made y His Majesty s Ministers. He said that he regarded anything I said as even more official than what his own Ministers said. I replied that, in anything I 1 sa Y I certainly spoke as the representative of my Government, but pointed out again that what I had said was not that the King had encouraged raiding, but that he was generally believed on the frontier to have done so. (I was careful nroughout this passage of arms neither to express disbelief in the King’s complicity nor to assert His Majesty’s Government’s belief in it.) 12 The King said that he could impose his authority on his tribes, and rererred at one moment to the action he had taken against Feisal-ed-Dawish and others.

I told him that I remembered the note to which he referred interim reply to the October memorandum in my conversation with eikh Yusuf Yasin on the 3rd February. At this Yusuf Yasin showed visible [!21 gg—3] B 24 perturbation and tried to make out that we had been talking about something different. I scouted this and reminded him of the heads of the conversation, as recorded in my despatch No. 45 of the 4th February, 1931. 13. His Majesty remarked that the questions at issue were too long to be threshed out in a private audience and that he was not conversant with all their details. If His Majesty’s Government wished for an answer to the memorandum n of the 28th February, he would instruct his Government to prepare one, but he ’ had three suggestions to make. I at once said that, while I would communicate any suggestions, His Majesty’s Government certainly required an answer to their memorandum. I had said that I had instructions to obtain one by the 4th March. The King intimated, with a gesture more than by words, that there need be no delay and proceeded to make his three suggestions as follows (1) Steps should be taken to ascertain which side had started the raiding. (2) Each side should promise that there would be no raiding during the proposed meeting, and should take stringent measures to restrain their tribes while it lasted, whatever the time might be—he spoke of a fortnight or a month. (3) At some stage in the meeting the loot taken by each side should be mutually restored. 14. I said that I did not understand the first suggestion and that the other two seemed to come within the scope of the reply to His Majesty’s Government’s memorandum. Raiding had gone on for years. The discussion became involved, as Yusuf Yasin presently joined in a duet with the King. It emerged, however, {a) that they were speaking only of the series of raids since the 1st August; (b) that the object of the King’s first suggestion was not that the sidfe which had initiated the raids after the 1st August should be held responsible for everything that followed and should alone be called on to restore loot, but that it should be saddled with the guilt of treachery; and (c) that this should be without prejudice to the mutual restitution of loot as contemplated in the King’s third suggestion. 15. This led up to the conclusion of the discussion, in the course of which I urged two points and the King added three of his own. He said that his Govern ment would reply to the memorandum of the 28th February, if he and Transjordan were treated equally. I intimated that the memorandum called for a reply by the 4th March, and that it should be an explicit reply. His Majesty’s Government had stated their desiderata under four distinct headings and had made one offer, namely, an offer of assistance in the Wadi Sirhan. The King intimated quite pleasantly that he did not think it would be necessary to take advantage of the latter offer. I again said I would put forward any suggestions he made, but I should like to have them in writing, either as part of the reply to the memorandum or in the form of a separate paper, just as His Majesty’s Govern ment had made Captain Glubb the subject of a separate paper. The essential thing was that His Majesty’s Government desired to have explicit replies to what they had said under the four heads. I had indicated the extreme gravity of the situation. It would be graver still, and graver than I could describe, if the reply were not explicit. My further point was that I could see no reason for making the return of the 800 camels raided from the Howaitat dependent on anything else. They had been taken in raids of which the Hejaz Government had previous knowledge. They were or had recently been close to the frontier. 16. The King attempted to deny that the Hejaz Government had had fore knowledge of the October raids. I cited the warning telegram to His Majesty s Legation as proof. This drove the King on to another line of defence whic appeared to be that there had been some warning from Amman of an impending Transjordan raid and that the same principle should apply, namely, tha Transjordan, having known of the raid or raids, should have been able to round up the raiders and return the loot. As neither of us knew tfoe exact facts, tnis led to nothing definite, but I clung to my point that the loss of 800 camels taken in October had reduced the Howaitat to starvation, and that they restored, else the Howaitat could not be restrained. I asked how it was tna , 1 there was any good answer about the October raids, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had ignored the notes of the Legation regarding them; His Majesty a the reputation of giving personal attention to the petitions of the meanest o his subjects.

Reply to (A) can only be conjectural In iry opinion objections stated in paragraph 3 of Hejaz Government's note of May 11th are genuine so far as they go but rest more fundamental considerations viz: intense mistrust of Glubb and Amir Abdullah and considerable suspicion of Hit Majesty's Government and myself. These feelings are al~ most certainly stimulated by certain features of corres pondence since February e.g, violent explosion on part of signs of willingness to produce statement of his measures to control situation and to bring Article 3 of Hadda agrs ment into operation; 'offer' of military assistance in his territory; and adoption by Transjordan of fixed forma, la 'send victims of raids to Glubb\ His internal situa tion is none too secure and he has to reckon with possi bility of trouble in area B.E. of frontier if it should grow worse. All these are reasons why he should not do anything to risk his prestige with his tribues or to pro mote direct contact between them and Transjordan Dscypher.

I inferred that the King feels very strongly about tribal sheikhs. Fuad's language rather suggested that assurance to be asked for as regards sheikhs seeking refuge in Transjordan, might facilitate understanding as to how they should be heard. I said therefore that although point was new to me and must be considered I did not personally think asylum would be given in suggested contingency. Actual words of note do not imply readiness to allow joint examination of sheikhs in any circumstances. It is just possible that If assurance were given it might facilitate compromise but I am not hopeful of this.

(R). iy telegiam No. 50 (ol' March 27thi Raiding situation on Transjordan..Hejez-Nejd frontier). Following are views of His Majesty's Government regarding reply to he returned to remaining points in Hejasi Government's memorandum of March 12th. 2. As regards prevention of raiding for the future * you shoiud point cut that the Hejazi Government have failed to return adequate reply to proposal in paragraph 7 of my telegram No* 45 (of March 7th) „ They merely repeal their original statement that they are prepared definitely to prevent raids oy their subjects during meeting, and when meeting is announced* This is not what His Majesty’s Government had in mind* They count upon Doth Hejazi and Transjordan Governments to do their utmost at all times 5 and not only during meeting, to present their subjecte from raiding,. It is with this end m view, and in order to dispose once and for all 01 ^ ie amours current on the frontier that Hejazi Government countenance or have countenaced raids on iiansjorvian tribes, that His Majesty’s Government have Proposed Dublin announcement by both sides categorically forbidding and disavowing all forms of raiding by their tribesmen at all Dimes, ancl intimating that offenders reCG ive exemplary punishment®2. I Q 7^ J 3 \ AS resardB otller e ^ly important aspect of the question, i.e. that of inmediate restoration of loot, I observe from enclosure in your despatch No. 90 ( 0 f March 10th) that an important passage appears to have been omitted from your memorandum of March loth to the Hejazi Government. Section 4c of my telegram No. 45 proposed that representatives should be empowered per sonally to supervise the arrangements for the Mediate restoration of loot on either side. Reply to Hejazi Government's memorandum must trice this into account. 4. You should, explain to Hejazi Government, with reference to points (a) to (e) in paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 61 (of March 14th) that His Majesty's Government have already (albeit reluctantly) agreed to decisions reached by representatives being ad referent cm condition that the necessary sanction shall be given ^' hout undue delay , and that they do not consider it desn^ie that matters should any longer be postponed by diSCUSslon on points Of procedure and details of -dinor importance. The main thing is that the represen- &amp;oives should be enabled to start practical work and Should be empowered personally to supervise arrangements ° r mutual restoration of loot without further delay. gh 5 ' i HiS Maj2Stjr ' 8 Government agree that representatives ^ i n . ihe xirst Instance take with them all available ^formation regarding raids, but they must obviously e r nee to supplement such information from local sources. hiey will cc. •*=•. f^m as possible reach their decisions without3. without sunmoning tribal Sheikhs. At the same time, presence ol certain representative Sheikhs may clearly os necessary in order to establish the facts it would be useless oo expect the Governments concerned to investigate the truth of conflicting statements regarding what has actually occurred. The facts can only be determined on the spot. His Majesty's Government accordingly feel that in cases where the two representatives cannot agree as to the facts, it is essential that they shall be empowered to summon those Sheikhs whose attendance may be considered necessary in order to assist them in their task. His Majesty's Government appreciate danger of quarrels arising between die Sheikhs at isolated meeting place on the frontier, buo consider Ghat this could be much reduced if guarantees of good behaviour are taken in advance by two Governments from Sheikhs concerned, and if two representatives take reasonable precautions. 6. As regards scope of the representatives' discussions, His Majesty's Government are of opinion thc-t they should deal with any raids which, owing to the tote on which they occurred, fall outside the scope of the MacDonnell enquiry. vou regards one surrender of raiding criminals not affpot 1 M ia J 'to ils is a Question -which does itshnni H v, u 5 e ^ 1 ™ ieaiate issue, settlement of which Maiestvi'o p 0t be £ll ° weci to delay, but that His in &amp; qon'-^? ver:nmen i koPS'i’O able to deal with it separate communication in the near future., ’ Hejazi Government accordingly.

Announcement regarding cessation of raiding* I approve your decision reported in last paragraph of your telegram No*88 (of April 10th.) not to ma.ke communication to Hejazt government proposed by High Commissioner for Transjordan* to whom position is being explained* His Majesty’s Government have alread undertaken that Transjordan authorities shall issue announcement a,s soon as Hejazi government have done so (see my telegram No.45 (of March 7th) paragraph 7). 2. Evidence of Sheikhs. It seems preferable to omit from proposed reply to Hejazi government any indication that Sheikhs summoned by the two representatives will be called upon to give evidence on oath* 3o Date of raids to be consideredo Formula proposed is designed to exclude alleged Transjordan raid of July 26th (see your telegram No*53 (of March 4th) paragraphs 3 and 6); you will realise tnat August 1st is in fact the agreed date to which Majesty's Government must hold the nejazi government , if and when it becomes necessary to name an actual date.

Reports have been floating about recently to the effect that Ihn Baud has been strengthening forces in x.orth. i hear also of Camel Corps being organised at Medina and the Government workshops at Mecca being engaged in conversion of ordinary motor cars into ex temporised armoured cars. I cannot vouch for the last two items and the report of unusual movements of troops are (? too, omit ted) common in this country to deserve much attention. Language of last notes read in conjunction with other recent communications suggests however the bare possi bility that the King may be trying to work up justifi cation for some kind of forward action.

He asks pressingly that there may be no recurrence of such incidents which increase difficulties on frontier and foreshadow danger extent of which his government cannot know.

His Majesty’s Government’s proposal is that, while discussions continue between two Governments with a view to agreeing on details of procedure to he adopted by Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid in examining claims arising from raids since August 1st, these two officials should meet immediately even if only for purpose of making contact and exchanging information and views in order to promote co-operation in prevention or limita tion of further raiding from both sides. Points still under discussion with Hejazl Government will therefore not arise in connexion with meeting and need not delay it. His Majesty’s Government certainly insist on their view that this preliminary meeting should take place immediately. 2, High Commissioner, Transjordan, is being requested to telegraph to you suggesting new date for meeting and giving material for reply on question of use of Jauf Wireless raised in Hejazi note of 29th March.B 12 !.

I feel hound to express the opinion that combined effect of Ibn Saud's proposals up to date will deprive meeting of any practical (grp.undec:) as a means of eotabllshing the co-operation which His Majesty's Government desire. He is unwilling to give Ibn Baud power to take any important decisions. What he really contemplates is a duel ad referendum between the two backers of the respective tribes preceded, if you insist, by preliminary meeting from which discussion of joint measures will be excluded. Above appreciation is based on correspondence exchanged.

I feel hound to express the opinion that combined effect of Ibn Sand's proposals up to date will deprive meeting of any practical (grp.undec:) as a means of establishing the co-operation which His Majesty's Government desire. He is unwilling to give Ibn Saud power to take any important decisions. What he really contemplates is a duel ad referendum between the two backers of the respective tribes preceded, if you insist, by preliminary meeting from which discussion of joint measures will be excluded. Above appreciation is based on correspondence exchanged.

M We agree in principle to meeting near the frontier hut as stated already see no practical advantage in such meeting unless there is agreement between the two governments upon matters to he dis cussed because we cannot on cur side give Ihn Zeid instructions regarding matters in dispute falling within his competency before we receive final reply of British government on our previous suggestions. Ihn Zeid cannot at present for reasons already given^ discuss with (Bnbb any of the questions forming the subject of our last note. If object of meeting is that the two should reach an understanding on measures to be taheh against evil-doers to prevent tneir evil actions, the matter is simple as measures are known and necessary information can be exchanged oetween them by Jauf wireless even if they do not meet. In case British government consider meeting essential even though its object be to arrive at agreement or interchange of information only we see no oojecuion to. o •to meeting if they inform us that they insist on their view. We hope it will meet with their approval that parties should initiate exchange of information by means of Jauf wireless station from now. If this is approved we snould be glad to know telegraphic signals used by Transjordan wireless station so that Jauf station may be notified and thus enabled to communicate.

My dear Sir Andrew, I have received your reply of 17 / 2/31 (29.9.1349) which you wished to hasten to send privately before the arri of the reply of the British Government to my note No.7/2/49. subject for astonishment. He (Neshmi) is the official who you resent and state that your Government will resent accusations directed against Captain Glubb who filled that area with confusion and untrue rumours directly he arrived there. 2. His Highness the Amir assured you in his note to which I referred in my previous letter, of the falsehood of the rumour which was spread to the effect that there is a plan anged for a raid against frans-Jordan, and I, in my subsequent note, assured you of the falseness of the rumour which states that a raid is being prepared to take place at the end of Ramadhai againot irans-Jordan. I hereby once more assure you that the fresh information received by His Britannic Majesty's High commissioner in Trans-Jordan is false and groundless. No money was distributed to the tribesmen; no tribes have assembled at al-Ula either with or without war banners; and no promise was given that a raid was to be made against Trans-Jordan after the M. App that is said to this effect is false, untrue and groundless. If Your Excellency is assured of this and it is evident 0 e British Government that all such information is false 2. Your severe accusation against An-Neshmi - ar ac based on rumours which I have assured you are false — is a an accusation never at any time did anything except try to maintain security within the area for which he is responsible. At the same time security /andand meant to cause disturbance on the frontier, as is known to have taken place before as the result of the action of that officerj if you are convinced of this then the matter will be easy and there will be no room left for the British Government to resent the direction of such accusations against that officer who has filled the territory of Trans-Jordan with tear and alarm, 4. With regard to the means you suggested for the improve ment of the situation on the frontiers, X have the following views (a) You requested that the camels looted from the Howaitat in October should he returned, hut if you said in this con nection that the camels looted hy the frans—Jordan Bedouin from our subjects since Mr,MacDonnell began his work until now, most of which are at the disposal of Captain Glubb, should at the same time be returned, if you have said this, it would be just and equitable, and you would then find us ready to comply with the request. (b) So to the bringing into operation of Article 3 of the Hadda Agreement, I have already informed you verbally that we are prepared to consider the suggestions you think best for the bringing into operation of that Article of the Agreement, (c) As to the prevention on our part of preparations for raiding into Trans-Jordan, if you refer to the first part of this note and realize that the information received by the British Government in this respect is untrue, you will be sure that there is no necessity for the adoption of measures to prevent those preparations because there is no preparation for raiding which would necessitate measures being taken to prevent it, I shared with Your Excellency the view, in our /latestlatest conversation in this connection, that the co-operation of the two Governments will prevent any discord or dispute on the frontiers and I am sure that you will also agree with me that to helieve in false information and to consider it incontestible will disturb the mind of people on the frontier more than it would calm them. This is a thing to which I wish to draw Your Excellency's attention, so that you may draw the attention of the British Government to it in order that they may prevent their officials from indulging in such disturbing and useless actions. With highest respects, Yours sincerely, (Sgd) YUSSUF YASIN.Copy translation . No. 7/2/22. ministry op foreign affairs, MECCA. 22/2/31. 5/10/1349. Your Excellency I have returned to resume work after the indisposition which I had in my health. I thank Your Excellency for the kind ness you shewed hy enquiring after my health from time to time. I regret to have to begin the correspondence with a question which has inconvenienced you as it has troubled us and tired all those concerned in the work on your side and ours. It is a question of fresh raids which have recently been carried out by the Trans- Jordan Bedouin against ours. We received yesterday the following be of the Beni Atiya, because in the battle a camel having the mark of Beni Atiya was killed, raided Hammad as-Seheimi of Belli and Suleiman ibn As*as al-Atwi at a place called adh-Dheirin and Al-Atwi who was raided at once rode away to appeal to his cousins for help and to go after the looted camels with a view to restor ing them. 2. On 26th Ramadhan (Feb.13th) Mohammed al-Araj who is residing at present with his people at Bair raided four houses at Balwat and Enuz. He came to them at night and fought against bhem in the evening. The result of the fighting was that the raiders were able to loot 34 camels of which 14 belong to Balwat and 20 to Enuz. Two men of the raiders were wounded. The Balwat at once gathered together and appealed to their parties for help and went after the raiders to restore the camels looted. Excellency ^Sir Andrew Ryan, B.B.m.M inister etc.. news:- 1. looted 40 camels. One camel belonging to the raiders was killed J eddaNo further news about the result of the pursuit is received. This is what has been reported to us now, and a few days ago information was received from Your Excellency concerning a raid said to have been committed by our Bedouin against the Bedouin of Trans-Jordan a n d orders were issued for investigation to be made with a view to discovering the facts. Such matters if left to continue in this way will be lengthened and broadened. The important thing is that we should know whether there is nothing to inconvenience the British Government themselves in these raids and whether no difficulties may arise between them and us from them. If there is nothing of the sort ? the matter is then easy, and we know the Bedouin of Trans-Jordan and the Bedouin ol iraiio—c; ox-dan know us very well, and we can some day far or near settle with them, but if the matter is such iihot .l t inconveniences tne mi cish Government whom it may inter— go u oo sm such a state oi affairs stopped and such raids prevent ed, and we beg you to acquaint us promptly with the mutual measures which we ought to take for the absolute prevention of these raids. Because the continuation of this state of affairs while the British Government are in the middle of this Question is a difficult problem, because it is difficult for us that our Bedouin should be entangled with British forces in Trans-Jordan, and it is also difficult for us not to protect and defend our subjects. i am therefore impatiently waiting for the suggest ions of the British Government concerning the necessary measures for the prevention of raiding, because all measures already taken have not had the slightest effect in the prevention of raids and the raiders have been secure from punishment, a fact which has made them more oppressive and encouraged them to continue their actions.

This constitutes a flagrant infraction of the Hadda Agreement and it is deplorable that such action should have been taken by an official of the Hejas-Hejd Government, when the latter had before them a detailed memorandum of His Majesty's Government urging the closest co-operation between the local authorities on the two sides of the frontier. His Majesty’s Government must insist that, if this had not already been done, the strongest measures should be taken to counteract the effect of Em^Heahmi’ s action In giving countenance to raiding and to make it publicly known that His Majesty King Abdul Asia expressly disavows and condemns it. His Majesty’s Government have now been informed that Hn-heshmi has been appointed commandant of the tribal forces with headquarters at Jauf, In view of his previous record they trust that this report will prove to be unfounded, 7 * these circumstances His Majesty*® Government request that the Heja» Government will inform them soon as possible that they agree to the proposal for a meeting between Captain Olubb and fieikh Abdul Asiz ibn Eeid and that they will invest the latter with full powers to deal with the matters proposed including the immediate restitution of camels and other loot taken from Trans-Jord&amp;n tribes &amp;ince August 1 aptain Qlubb will also be authorized to arrange for the restitution of any loot identified as having been taken from Hejazi or Hejdi tribes, 8 * Having regard, however, to the urgent necessity and evident justice of restoring to the franJordan tribes the /largelarge number of camels looted during September and October in tbe exceptionally unjustifiable circumstanoes described above.

Department. 47&lt;J3A 5000 10 30 The Government of India's views on the reactions of a breach with Ibn Baud or the taking of coercive action against him on the Indian political situation are set out in their telegram on P.h. 1454/31, flagged. The minutes on that paper resume the developments of the situation up to 14th March. We were then awaiting Ibn Baud's reply to our latest Note. On the assumption that this was satisfactory, it looked as though the danger of a breach would be definitely averted. We have now received Ibn Baud’s reply ( p - Z - 1608/3±, ilagged). It is not altogether satisfactory. As we had anticipated, the King is not prepared to delegate full powers to his representative in the proposed local discussions between representatives of His Majesty’s Government and the Hejaz for the purpose of examining claims and counter claims. Further, he sees objection to empowering hxs representative^to summon representative Sheikhs as witnesses, etc., and he is not convinced that there is any practical advantage in the representatives of the two Governments ’’forming themselves into a tribunal, entitled to investigate and interrogate”. There is no doubt a certain amount to be said for Ibn Baud’s point of view. But acceptance of his counter-proposals is likely to protract still further the process of reaching a satisfactory settlement of c these claims and counter-claims. In particular, the absence of power to call for representative Sheikhs will reduce the chances of satisfactory proof or disproof in specific cases, while any cases reserved for/I ywv . for decision between the two Governments are only likely finally to be disposed of after much noting and counter noting on both sides. A meeting of the official Middle Eastern Sub- Committee of the C.I.D. has been fixed for 12.0 to-morrow morning to consider the reply to be sent bo Ibn Saud. It is probable that the Air Ministry will press that, in view of the not wholly satisfactory nature of the reply, recourse should now be taken to forcible sanctions. The Colonial Office, who regard themselves as responsible for the interests of Transjordan, are likely to give them a measure of support. The Foreign Office departmentally regard the reply as falling short of what-we could have wished, and do not exclude the possibility of a resort to force. It is understood that Dr. Dalton, who has seen these papers but who is not, I gather, yet fully versed in their details, was at first sight disposed to favour the a PPlication of strong pressure to Ibn Saud. The question for decision^is the line to be taken by the India Office representative. We have consistently maintained that we are not concerned with the details of these claims and counter claims, but only with the broad political reactions of the application o^ force to Ibn Saud or of a breach with him on the Inoian political situation, particularly as affecting txie Mahomedans. On this we have now the considered view of the Government of India which, I submit, ciearly indicates that forcible measures should be resorted to only in the last extremity, and if the situati is so serious that His Majesty’s Government feel obliged t risk the possibility of Moslem reactions of an unfortunate nature in India. It seems very difficult to believe 0 that/Minute Paper. m \ y* - ^ ‘ Department. 4 ' IJ3a 5000 10 that the situation is in fact of such gravity as to justify this. While the balance of right is no doub on our side, the Transjordan case is by no means watertight and, while Ibn Baud's latest reply may not be wholly satisfactory, it seems very difficult to maintain that it is so unsatisfactory as to justify a resort to sterner measures (which in any case would be very unlikely in the long run to produce the desired effect). We have unfortunately through laying, it is su gg ested, too much stress on number of relatively minor incidents, got ourselves into a position from which it is not easy to retreat with dignity. I suggest that, subject to the course of the discussion to-morrow, I might be authorised to take the line that the Secretary of State supports the views set out in the Government of India's to leer am; that he would be unable to agree to any threat of forcible - actTcui against Ibn Baudjwithout the concurrence of the Cabinet; that he is noo ff]f. satisfied, on the facts available uo him, that the situation which has developed isiof such a nature as to justify a resort to *orciole pressure, and that, in the interests of the Inciian political situation, which on a broad view is incomparably more important than the securing of our (tfis (return of the 300 camels of the Howeitat, etc., m Transjordan), he would be obliged, as at present advised, to oppose such action f at any rate at the present stage, but that he would see no objection to the sending of a fairly stiff reply to Ibn Baud,un accompanied/accompanied by threats of sanctions, in the event of his failure to accede to our wishes. yIn any further communication on tMs^bject* please quote no.

Hejaz Government note acceptance by His Majesty T s Government of principles suggested in para graph 4 of their memorandum of March 3rd. They cannot agree to suggestion that Ibn Zeid should be given full powers to settle all questions of raids definitely in view of distance which separates him from Central Government and fact that/ latter have no means of rapid communication with frontier area such as to enable Ibn Zeid to receive all necessary inform ation in good time. For this and other internal reasonsreasons Hejaz Government v/oulcl prefer that'His Majesty's Government s lion Id accept all points indicated in para graph 4 of memorandum of march 3rd. They agree that loth governments should within shortest possible time and without undue delay make their observations and accept or criticise decisions arrived at by the two representatives after they have been received. 3. Hejaz Government agree that Ibn Zeid and Glubb should examine raids from date on which MacDonnell started- work up to present time by oral exchange of information. They see no practical advantage in their forming themselves into a tribunal entitled to investi gate and interrogate. They see much ground for apprehension in this and more particularly if it is intended to summon Sheikhs in order to obtain informa tion from them during the meeting. Experience has shown that a meeting in one place of Sheiks when raids and attacks have produced spirit of hostility leads to quarrels, and such disputes in isolated frontier places may cause dangerous incidents. The Hejazi Government consider practical course to be the following. (a) Each representative to take with him all necessary information regarding previous raids. (b) Claims in respect of those raids to be examined during meeting; decisions to be taken in *ases where representatives are satisfied of the truth thereof; these decisions to be submitted to their governments by quickest means; and restitution to be effected immediately on sanction being given. (c)6 . 3. (c) As regards claims about which representa tives are at variance each shall forward to his Government summary of conversations and shall indi cate proof tendered so that the Governments may communicate with each other with a view to agreeing on best manner of settlement,, (d) Each representative to be entitled to request prolongation of meeting in order to obtain further information which he may find necessary, in the course of discussiono (e) Representative of each Government will thus act as agent for respective tribes and it will be for him to defend their rights. In this way many difficulties and dangers can be avoided which woald be likely to arise in the neighbourhood, of the frontier, if tribal chiefs should meet in remote Places, 4„ The Hejazi Government see no objection to Ibn Zei.d and Glubb exchanging information about haj.ds, and they will instruct 1'bn Zeid in accord ance with provisions of Hadda agreement. 5. Hejazi Government are prepared to act in accordance with proposal made by the King in his conversation with Sir A. Ryan as regards definite Prevention of raids on both sides during meeting 01 re P r2 sentatives to discuss raids; and they are Prepared definitely to prevent raids by their sub jects when meeting is announced.6 . Hejazi Government though strongly desirous that meeting should take place as soon as possible regret inability to fix exact date because of recent damage to wireless at-Jauf. Instrument which had been damaged was despatched some days ago by car from Jefida. At the earliest resent at which communication can be restored His Majesty's Government will be Informed of time at which meeting will be possible. Hejazi Government cannot fix place either before consulting Ibn Zeid, If His majesty's Government like to suggest place Hejazi Government will enquire of Govemorate of Jauf whether it will be convenient or whether Governorate has alternative suggestion to make A 7.

The minutes of the discussion which took place in the official Middle-East Sub-Committee of the c.I.D. on uriday, otn March, have now been received and are flagged. We have not yet received any intimation from Sir Andrew Ryan of the action taken by him on the telegram approved on P.Z.1433, but the general situation is fortunat6iy no\v nucTi ss,sier. The Government of India's reply to our enquiry as to the probable political reactions of a breach with Ton S aud is g±ven in their te 1 e g r a m ' of the 9th March, P.Z. 14 54/31, copies of which have been distributed to the official Middle-East Sub-Corninittee. The telegram makes it quite clear that the ejections from the purely Indian standpoint to a breach with Ibn Sand U- are^ at any rate JhM' the present manent j substantial^ and it is valuable to have on record this considered expression of the Government of India's view, in case the situation should unfortunately deteriorate in the near future and the question of sanctions again cone under consideration. The Minister at Jeddah has enquired (see his telegram x of 7th March 1931) whether the Home Departments concerned will make themselves responsible for keeping the Government of India in touch with the developments of a situation which, as he says, may have 'important Moslem reactions'. We have in fact sent (and continue to send) copies of all correspondence by ordinary or air mail to the Government of India. They are not really concerned with the details of the situation but only with any serious turn which it may take. Our telegram of 5th March would have informed them of the first turning- point. When we have received Ibn Saud’s reply to the propositions/ s» V R J f M X 11 propositions which Sir Andrew Ryan has been authorised to put to him, we might send a further telegram departmentally to the Government of India, informing them of the stage which things have reached and indicating that full weight would be given, in the event of any deterioration in the situation, to the considerations urged in their telegram of 9th March. {yft.UXit-Ur+AMB/FCU/AW.

A meeting of the Standing/Suh-C^nittee too* place on Friday afternoon to consider Sir Andrew Ryan's telegrams No.52 and 53 and the reply to he sent to Ihn Sand. a lengthy discussion in the course of which oir Andrew Ryan's telegram No.54, giving hia appreciation of the effect on Ihn Saud'of a threat to withdraw the Minister was considered, it was agreedjthat the best course was to concentrate on securing discussion between local representatives of the two powers of the raid claims and counter claims since the 1st August last; that we should therefore ignore the minor points on which Ihn Saud had not given ua complete satisfaction (e.g.the punishment of Neshmi) and tfai reply in rather stiff terms accepting the principles which he had suggested as a preliminary to a meeting, and urging that the meeting should take place with the minimum of delay. On a minor point it was agreed,after considerable discussion,that while we might accept the King's requirement, that th.e results of th.e discussion should be ad referendum to the two Governments? we should indicate to him that in our view local settlement was, in principle, distinctly preferable and that were not to be regarded as abandoning that principle. The meeting further agreed as regards sanctions that, in the event of a wholly unsatisfactory outcome to the proposed discussions, the question of pressure on lbn Saud would have to be considered. Sir Andrew Hyan’s telegram made it clear that withdrawal or the threat of withdrawal, even for consultationwould 'be an effective weapon if H.M.G. were prepared . to uae it. It was recognised at the same time that its reactions might, as the Minister had pointed out, he not unimportant, and that it would need careful- consideration before any decision was taken. The general feeling of the civil departments was, however, that it was in principle definitely preferable to active operations which, other objections apart, were probably likely to be distasteful,in principle,if they could be avoided, to H.M.G. It was agreed that a telegram of instructions to Sir Andrew Byan, explaining the position and communicating the text of a memorandum to serve as the basis for a communication to the Hec^jaz Government should be prepared by the IMG. and circulated for concurrence. r-LSir A» Kj&amp;n, Jedda, i Tour telegrams Vos, 53, 53, 54 and 5; of March 3, 4 ami 5v- Tranajordan-Hajaz-Sejd frontier crisis * Hi a .£&amp; Jd st j f s Oovemawmt c on s 1 der Cyfher, that esaential object ahotaid oa to hrinr* Political di Htr Ibution about Immediate meeting of frontier authorities Repeat to Transjordan. and thus to secure that question be dealt with • m d ' ; * ;• j- (at any rat© during next stage) on local an i Copies to: G #0« 1*0, A.M. and to members of Middle East Official Sub-Committee.

Ryan had on February 28th presented to the Hedjazi Government the memorandum the text of which was contained in Foreign Office telegram No.34 to Jedda, and had arranged to discuss the matter orally with King Ibn Saud on Monday %/ 9 iviarch nnd ? but that no indication had yet been received as to the Hedjazi Government ? s or Ibn Saud r s reactions. He hoped that a definite report would be received on this point within the next two or three days* Until it came m, it was difficult to consider the action to be tahen; but he considered that the primary object to be obtained was to secure an early meeting between Captain G-lubb and Auu.u.1 Aziz Ibn Zeid P since such a meeting was a necessary preliminary to the restoration of the loot, Ibn Saud ? s reply might be angry and defiant, but he thought it more probable that it would be of a somewhat temporising character ? jeossibly suggesting a compromise. SI A JOEU SHUCEBURGH seAd that the question for immediate consideration was that of the course of action to be recommended by the Committee in the event of Ibn Saud 1 s reply being wholly unsatisfactory* GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE stated that the reason the Air Ministry desired this meeting was that in the event of a b re had own in dipj.lomatic negotiations His Majesty 1 s Government, it appeared, would be faced with the necessity for taking coercive measures or else submitting to Ibn Saud 1 s terms. Assuming coercive measures were necessary it was, from a Service point of view, desirable to act with as little delay a s possible. The Air Staff thex-efore hoped to save time by (1)(2) getting aome ogreemont which would bo available for inmodiato reference to the lllnisterial Oonaixttee should thi become neoessary. Ho inatuncod the necessity for avoiding ctelay by reference to info mat ion received since the last meeting to the effect that Ibn band had moved Nejd tribes oast of the ■L^'Dl bimuitu liras it was probable alternative (a) oi the mr Staff mem cron dim was already forest ailed c Eo pointed out that once it became obvious us tnuo coercive measures were necessary, delay was dangerous as it would permit Ibn Sand to make counter preparations, such possibly as the reinforcement of his desert posts 0 SIR J Oi la SnuCEBUxllH asked If any alternative diplomatic proposals to the measures suggested by the ~ir Ministry had been considered. GROUP CAPlAlIT PAIRSR stated that the Air Staff Memorandum had been prepared on the assumption of a breakdown in diplomatic negotiations which would necessitate coercive measures as a last resource. SIR JOHN SHUOMEURGH expressed the opinion that if the somewhat stiff note that had been presented to Ibn Saul proved of no effect 5 His Majesty 1 s Government could not sit still and do nothing* He wished to consider whether any other solution less forceful than that prepared by the Air Ministry could be found. He drew attention to the difficulty in dealing with a Government such as that of the EeGjaz on the lines of Western diplomacy* He raised the question whether the withdrawal of our Minister was likely to be an effective alternative^ MR* RHIHDHL considered that the course of action to be pursued by His Majesty* s Government would oeindicated not bo muon 'by the, BoLEtcionn-; of Thn Sand ? '.s reply Int by its tone. If o. defiant attitude were adopted, strong action will be necessary. If the tenor of Ion S and -s reply were conciliatory, then more peaceful measures were indicated,. No indication had yet been received in the Foreign Office as to what were Ibn Saud T s reactions to the note. He considered that the following were the main objections tomooereive action. Before recommending such a course to the Ministerial Sub-Committee, these objections most be refuted:- (1) The Foreign. Office had opposed an incurs5 on into Kedjav;--hojd territory since this would involve a vitiation of the Hadda Agreement, which would be inconsistent with the appeal which we were making to Ibn Sau&amp; to implement that Agreement 0 If, on the other hand, Ihn Sand refused to respond to that appeal, we could represent the Agreement as having temporarily lapsed, and this argument would no longer apply. (S) An incursion into Hedja.z-Nejd territory might give Ibn Baud or his tribes an excuse for violating the Trane j or dan frontier e2.se where. Borne of Ibn Baud T s advisers were still urging him to recover the disputed area ox Akaba and Maexu f lie re had oeen reports of tribal concentret2.o.'.is on the disputed frontier and 2.t was iiioporoanx that any danger ox this kind should be fully rcaixsed. (3) •There might be an adverse reaction on the^ relations between Ne id and Iraq,.. Tue j.ragx Prune Mini a _ was about to proceed to Jedda to ^ carry out dxxfiouj. and important negotiations, and it would ue un fortunate if this effort to pur relations 6oVc.cn the two countries on a satisfactory basis snouxd break do?/n^ (4) The risk of the expedition proving ^successful must he considered. In oveno, « m o -•- » ■ ixueditiou might become necessc*iy, ^nu. j ^ difficult to say where the mat'oer would end. SIB JOHN SHPCZBUHGH pointed out that we % wo: to protect the tribes in our mandated we should lay ourselves under obligation territory. If we foiled uO ao so, Gene\'a and. elsewhere which it would p.;,c-r e wa s the further consideration for reasons which need not open to criticism au be difficult to meet that at the are sent raomu.-o ?be gone into, Arab feeling in 0: rang Jordan and Palestine w somewhat embittered againsb the Mandatory, It was most undesirable that thus reeJ.;,;:,.g cx hostility should be increased y part id uiar ly as,, j.n -.ns not impossible con tingency of Arab trouble in Palestine* the support and co-operation of the Emir Abdulla and the Transjordan Government would be of the highest importance 0 M.Ro HEHDEL considered that the withdrawal of HAA Minister would be exceedingly unwelcome to Ibn Saud, whose prestige would be much damaged thereby,. In reply to a question as to the practical effect on our relations with Ibn Saud, he thought that, since Ibn Saud was so seldom at Jedda, the v/ithdrawal of the Minister would not necessarily prove as serious an inconvenience as at a pos where personal relations with the responsible Government we re c ontinuous, SIR JOHM SHUCSBURGH as lea if there were any commercial. mea-sures by which pressure could be brough's to bear, GROUP CAPTAIU PEIRSE stated the Air Staff had reviewed the possible economic courses, such as inter cepting the Rualla tribe during their annual migration, hut that as the Rualla were a Syrian tribe the effect on Ibn Saud would not necessarily be consideraoie anu difficulties with the Trench would proDaoxy ensueo A. certain amount of trade between Uejd and Maan and Amman could be intercepted., but this course could only oe looped upon as sue s id i a rye SIfl JOEH SHlTCKBTJriG-H reminded the CoEinxttee that a proposal had ocen made some years ago xcn. olocl.&lt;-deof Bm S&amp;tid ? « Persion Oii.Tf T&gt;ort^ ^ J - P y - LC ’“-'° celxeved tnat the Government of India hod been aopoBed to the 3 ,ag^ t ion* Idi, hAir&amp;xkl'ZM eaid that this wn? a proposal which had originally been made in 19 E 4 and revived in 1923 by tto 0 emails loner in Irac^ fhe Government of India had o.a the latter occasion taken strong exception to iwp or. ac^ono.t or its prejudicial effect on Indian trade, and of the facts that an effective blockade would have to j.xj.cI- do tiite Red Sea as well as the Gulf, and that a hxcsx blockade ox tne t) 6 iiirat—el—Arab vrould be likely to have an unfortunate effect on Indian Moslem feeling* It seemed unlikely* in the circumstances, that progress could be made along these lines* 31K dOEt v ShLTO.KBUBGH was strongly of opinion tJ'.at laiding could 'best be dealt with locally* He doubted whether tl ia re wor no. he much Improvement until a party of raiders had actually been intercepted in Transjordan territory and severely pun is he d* Apart from that he was all in favour of co-operation between local officers such as Captain Glubb and Abdul Asiz Ibn Zeid, with a view to the settlement of details* Ee thought it urgent that some effective action should be taken* Otherwise there might be a recrudescence of raiding on a large scale, MR* WARNER stated that Mr* Macdonell had reported that such raids should be settled inter^-t rib ally 9 Hence the proposed meeting of Captain Glubb and Ion Zeid, GROUP CAPTAIN PEI REE again drew attention to the fact that the Air Ministry proposal had only been put forward for enforcement in the event of Ibn Baud refusing to negotiate.part of Ton. Send would much o trough non the argument for strong action* GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSEj referring to the earlier objections to coercive action raised by Mr. Bendel, pointed out that In arriving at the proposals in the Air Staff Memorandum the Air Staff had fully appreciated the situation and given careful consideration to the counter measures open to Ibn Sand and the possible strength of his forces. They were satisfied that the means for carrying out their proposals were avallaole ana adequate. Risk was a factor which had to be expected in any operation. The occupation of Kaf, as suggested, was a comparatively simple matter. He anticipated ample warning should Ibn Saud instigate any counter offensive measures for the recapture of Kaf.. In this connection an opinion had been sought from the iuChC. Palestine, ..'ho, independent of Air Staff views, selected the occupation of Kaf as the most practical means of attaining our eiiuS.

Lii.I r fHviAITE, in reply to an enquiry as to the view which the India Office were likely to take of active measures against II,n Baud on the lines discussed above, said that the narter had not yet been considered closely by ohe secretary of State for India, and that he was unabfa r,o say what his feeling was likely to he. The India Ofrice were interested in this matter principal.:./ oecciiise o± the potential political reactions in India and on Indian Moslem feeling of an open breach with Ibn Sand and offensive operations against him. It was true that both parties in this case were Mahomedans, and that would ease the situation* Further, Ibn Saud represented a puritan and ascetic sect which had probably few, if any, Indian followers, and which certainly was far from popular with many orthodox Indian Moslems. In these circumstances, it was conceivable that, i^ Kis Majesty i s Government found themselves in the last resort obliged to take active measures against Ibn Saud, difficulty need not be expected in India. But the Government of India had in the past been very sensitive on this subject, and it was possible that the Secretary of State for India, even if himself disposed to concur in action of the nature contemplated, might think it q . desirable before finally agreeing to take the precaution of consulting the Viceroy. Unscrupulous agitators, if they wished to take the opportunity afforded by active measures against Ibn Saud to embarrass us by re^res^ntin t , His Majesty 1 s Government as hostile to Moslem aspirations, would not be deterred from doing so by any consideration of the merits of the case. ss t that in these circumstances It was agreed to sugge age, i should the Secretary of State for Inaia on consideration it would be of advantage, in the interests of expedition,(9) deem that course necessary, if he ware at once to consult the Viceroy as to the probable effect on the Indian political situation of of fens- ^ _ ^(‘uiun against Ibn Saud, OO^OTJS.IO^: (1) The general feeliino’ n f t&gt;,p ■ -•, L e .p t » n,“° LX blLe meeting was that T7 x n - 0uLl ^ 3 re ply is decidedly unsatisfact o-rv 1 1 may be r e c e s s a tv t n f - v o ^ v u —.^eccory no pjT'r t0 o^ssoic measures au ue_LOv; — enner (l ' h P h TEC i i0 - actioa each as the withdrawal of ohe Minister from Jed.da: (ii) or aIternatirely Active^coercive measures on the lines 3 /? r a y; 3 fAir Ministry Memorandum wicii^iOJ v i z; - a) In the event of intelligence revealing the presence of any hejd tribes grazing within if 13 ^ northern, or middle area of the a force of armoured d &lt; r c r, F 0 supported by aircrait recoiinaissance will round up the tribes and drive off any Iiowe it at camels or others up to the numbers of those looted'(i e e, 800).

Main point of audience. I strongly emphasised youf views regarding Gluhh. I said that your memorandum regarding general situation was statement of position of His Majesty’s Government in their own language and that matter v/as out of my hands hut that I was instructed to add communication regarding (a) extreme gravity of situation (h) wish of His Majesty’s Government for definite reply before the evening of March 4th and (c) universal belief on frontier that large raids from Nejd were carried out under King’s authority. I indicated as from myself facts which lent colour to this belief. King accused Glubb of starting false allegations but qualified this by half admission that he might not have originated them and disclaimed intention of attacking Glubb. He denied that Neshmi now had any official employment but intimated that he bad only been dismissed because he was in bad caour in Transjordan:. . He asked that His Majesty’s Government should treat both sides equally and expressed readiness to ly preceding telegram;- inflictinilico q.w ubl6 pux 1 l.sbn 102 j.lj on hl.s own sriibiocljs jLx criminals in T nans Jordan ■. wo no oimisbsd. icssnoGd suggesoion ubal he was pensonal,ly ret,po.asioxe foi raids* As a King he was entitled to explanation and, failing proof to satisfaction, x ScJ.cl rhcxu I was not makirig accusations but stating facos as to belief on the frontier. I again referred to colourable reasons for the belief beginning with Fuad 1 s note of November 20th refusing to condemn raiders from Nejd until raids from nans Jordan nad entirely ceased. The King asked if thau view was rignt or wrong. I said it was wrong« ihe King said he could not see his subjects robbed ana plundered. I reproached him with the failure to answer British memorandum of October. He quoted Buad’s interim reply which I refused to take serious ly a nd with which I had in any case dealt in conversation of February 3rd with Yusuf Yasin. discussion became more and more diffuse. At intervals I reverted to the gravity of the situation and need for explicit reply to the last memorandum* The King premised one but put forward his own suggestions viz. (1) steps should be taken to ascertain which side started the raid after August 1st and that side should bear the guilt of treachery; (2) no raids to take place during proposed meeting and stringent measures to be taken by both sides to restrain tribes; (3) mutual restoration of loot at some stage of meeting which he seemed to think3 . might last some time. I promise to r^t ^ ' U ' b ^ T '° Pux lorward. any suggestions rnads in v/riiln^ hnt out again urged tPe necessity of explicit reply to your desiderata under lour distinct headings accompanied by offer of assist ance in Wadi Sirhan. The Kino- n^n+ ne llln S Politely refused the offer. I specially stressed the importance of restoring 800 camels to starving Howoltat. The King expressed (1) desire for good relations; (2) ability to control his subjects and readiness to inflict merited punishment and (3) inability to accept that his subjects should be treated Inequitably„ i then brought the discussion to an end fl 2, Summary of reply of March 3rd regarding GlubD c Confidence cf Kis Majesty s s Government in Giubb and his appointment to any post whatsoever concern only His Majesty 5 s Government„ Rumours of impending raids from Nejd are untrue whatever their crislru Tnls denial does not reflect on His Majesty 5 s Government, Best proof of falsity of reports is that Ramazan and feast have passed without raids taking place 0 His Majesty-s Government have complained about besnmi and Hejaz government have complained about Giubb 0 Tills does not constitute illegitimate attack aud is to be attributed to the interest friends have in avoiding causes of dispute, 3, Summary of Hejaz counter memorandum March ord 0 (l) King declares his desire to bring article 3 of Haddar agreement into force as stated by Yusuf -asin on February 3rd. (2) as regards liquidation of claims4. claims, when His Majesty’s Government declare their readiness to satisfy elates of Hejaz subjects as from July 26th to a present date viz. 1198 camels, compensation for seven deaths, 620 dollars and one rifle as notified to the British Minister, the King will order proved claims Of Transjordan tribes to be met* 4. As regards principles to be observed bv representatives the King suggests to take place at or near frontier following: (a) meeting as agreed upon from time to time, (b) Telegraphic communication be maintained ty means of Jauf wireless, (c) Representatives to exchange information regarding all raids, (d) Raids in the nature of theft to be immediately reported and criminals pursued by government in whose territory the crime took place and stolen property to be returned against receipt, (e) Representatives to exchange information regarding big raids and to meet if necessary with a view to settlement, bach representative to submit proposed settlement to his government for sanction in order to ensure its effectiveness, (f) Representatives to confine them selves to matters relating to raids and to deal with nothing else* (g) Representatives to treat each other w ith courtesy and meet as equals* On receiving assent °f Kis Majesty's Government to the above it will be Possible to instruct Ibn Zeid accordingly. 5* Paragraph 5 of British memorandum speaks of inability of Transjordan to guarantee maintenance of improved situation unless camels captured'.t captured from their tribes are restored. When similar langutige was used in a note from Hejaz Ministry of Foreign affairs his Majesty’s Governmeni did not agree and British Minister also Insisted during his recent audience that this theory was wrong (this is a specious attempt to pervert my criticism of note of November 20th). King thinks it surprising that what on his side is wrong is accounted acceptable on the other side. King agrees that by Arab standards raids should have ceased during Macdonnell enquiry but it Was Transjordan that failed to respect this principle, iheir trices began to raid as soon as Macdonnell embarked on his mission as is proved by raids of July 26th, August 21st, September 1st and September 2nd. Their raids have since gone on. Transjordanian tribes began and Nejd raid (of September presumably) came later. Although it was a matter of reciprocity investiga tion was made; number of camels looted proved to be only 120; 86 of these which belonged to Transjordanian tribes were restored the rest being returned to Nejd owners. This proves that treachery was not on Nejd sl.de but on that of Transjordan. 7. The King cannot a sation against Nesiimi6 Neshmi who merely worked for security of those for whom he was responsible, He was removed from his post only to avoid controversy with His Majesty's Government ne did his best for peace but Transjordanian tribes have always beer the beginners of evil conduct and Nejdls have sometimes had to defend themselves. 8 * King is P re Pared to instruct Ibn Zeid to meet Glubo vhen he receives reply of His Majesty's Government. As for restitution of loot to Transjordanian tribes it cannot be undertaken until start is made with restoration of property belonging to King's subjects. 9. The King infoims His Majesty's Government, with thanks for their offer of assistance in Wadi Sirhan, that he has power, thank God over all his subjects. If he needs any help it is the promise of His Majesty's Goverrment to hand over criminals if they fled from punishment into Transjordan. King awaits reply in order that he may send necessary instructions to Ibn Zeid.

The India Office are not directly concerned and in the ordinary course take no part in the discussion of policy. They come in on the present occasion only because there is some danger that matters may reach a point at which His Majesty's Government may be forced to consider the taking of drastic action against Ibn Saua. This is of possible importance to us in vi6w of i uS poiiont/isii roricfions on ‘Lh t ■ Indisn political situation and on Mahomedan opinion m that country. It is difficult to judge what might be the reactions on Indian political opinion of a breach with Ibn Saud. He represents a puritan and ascetic form of Mahomedanism which is far from popular with many of his Indian coreligionists, and it is conceivable that difficulty with him leading to the use of force against him might not prove embarrassing tcTus.^ On the other hand, he holds the Holy Places and controls the Pilgrimage; he is one of the great Moslem potentates of the world; our opponents and critics in India have never/p never been slow to turn to advantage any opportunity givei them of embarrassing us by representing us as being hostile to Islam; and it seems desirable to go rather carefully in a matter such as the present. That is more particularly so as, on the facts available, our case is not quite watertight. The general impression given by it is that we may be 75%right, but that there is certainly 25% on the Hejaz side, and it seems doubtful whether, even if we fail to get satisfaction from Ibn Saud by diplomatic means for our present demands, the case for more active measures against him - having regard to the possible react of such measures - is conclusive. The Foreign Office are disposed to favour strong pressure (though they are uncommitted as to any specific form of forcible action), ions n : I since they regard His Majesty’s Government as having a responsibility as mandatories. The Colonial Office are moire strongly inclined to favour active measures, because they have had trouble with Ibn Saud in the past: he has not beejn a goo q neighbour from their point of view either in Iraq or iransjoraania, ana they feel that they have an obligation oo the i rans Jordanian tribes. The Air Ministry are, of course, concerned solely as the instruments of the Civil Departments, but from the purely Service point of view regard active measures as the right course if diplomatic measures fail. They are not concerned with the possibility of political reactions. 4* I was asked the view of the Secretary of otate as to probable active measures, and indicated in the Standing Sub-Committee that he had not yet considered the matter in any detail, and that it would be impossible, therefore, to say what his view would be rrom our point of view the matter w?as of interest solely in connection with possible political reactions in India. J cUx i U.u, it/Minute Paper. Department. It might well be, therefore, that, if the worst came to tn- worst ana active operations against Ibn Baud had to be considered at a later stage, the Secretary of State xor India would think it desirable to consult the ovcrnriunt of India as to probable reactions on Moslem opinion before he committed himself. The meeting, having reached the conclusion that the alternative methods o f dealing with Ibn Saud were - (a&gt; diplomatic, such as, e.g., the withdrawal of the Minister from Jedda; (b) active coercive measures on the lines suggested by the Air Ministry, decided to invite the Secretary of State, if he considered this necessary, to consult the Government of India immediately as to the probable effect of these measures on Mahomedan opinion should a situation arise necessitating closer consideration of them. I submit a draft telegram for consideration. U- L *■« A- tm, r%—rm t - /—«. * ft lurL /av* ^ . rCuOtj ac ^ ' £x 4-7^-: &lt;u A C&amp;. ^ Q- OU 7 iirx ^ ^ | Tt&lt;A serious situation has arisen as between King Ibn Saud of the Hejaz and His Majesty's Government as mandatories for Transjordania in connection with trans frontier raids. Raiding and counter-raiding is endemic in this area, but His Majesty's Government since their acceptance of the mandate .have done their utmost to keep .the Transjordan trices under control and to secure that a corresponding control should be applied by Ibn Saud to his tribesmen in the Hejaz and Nejd. An agreement, known as the Hadda Agreement, concluded with Ibn Saud in 1925, provides a machinery for dealing with such raids and their results, and lays down one general principles to be observed in the matter by the two Governments. But for various reasons full effect has. not so far been given to it. Raiding from Nejd appears to have reached a particularly serious point towards the end of last year, a,nd it is alleged that some 800 camels stolen from, iransJordanian, tribes were at one point on the Nejdi side of tne border. Owing to the superior control exercised by His Majesty’s Government, we have been able to prevent the Transjordan tribes to a large extent (from raiding m search of these camels, but the result of this has been to fray the temper of the tribes in question, more especially as we have not succeeded in securing restitution from Ibn Saud by diplomatic means. The situation, is complicated by the fact that intercepted information appearsto indicate that in one case at any rate Ibn Saud himself was privy to a Nejdi raid, and that in others one of his local Governors (sine© transferred to another post) encouraged the raiders in the name of the,King. Ibn Saud meets our requests with allegations (for which there is.some foundation) of counter raids/raids by Transjordan, and by the denial of minor allegations made against him and his officials. The situation was considered by the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government at the beginning of February. As a result the Foreign Office telegrams, Nos - 20 ~ 22 ’ of 6th February, on P.Z. 764/31, flagged, were sent to Jedda. They explain* the situation. The Minister at oedda replied on 10th February (P.Z. 895/31), criticising the instructions in question on certain points; emphasising the need for going carefully with Ibn Saud; and suggesting that a note of protest would sufficiently meet the case. He intimated that he was making personal representations in his onvate capacity to the Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs. On 24th February he telegraphed the Hejaz Minister's reply (P.Z. 1149/31). It is worth reading, as indicating the line which the Hejaz Government are likely to take. This reply was followed up on 2 / 2nd February by a further official note of protest.against'the raiding activities of the Transjordanian tribes (P.Z. 1200/31). •“■he whole question of the policy to be adopted m the light of Sir Andrew Ryan's representations and of these developments was considered by the Standing Official Sub-Conmittee for questions concerning the Middle East, on 25th February. .Minutes of their proceedings are flagged. There was general agreement that a strong protest should be made to Ibn Saud, but it was decided that an Air Ministry proposal to include in the proposed communication a definite threat that we would use force if the looted camels were not returned would certainly need Cabinet approval, and was in any case of doubtful soundness. Reference is invited to the proceedings, and particularly to the remarks made by Mr. Rendel on pages 1 and 2. A compromise was found and the telegrams on P.Z. 1181/31 were despatched/despatched to the Minister at Jedda. On 28th February Sir Andrew Ryan sent m, in accordance with his instructions, the memorandum the draft of which had been telegraphed to him and which was worded in strong terns, to the Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs, requesting an audience and intimating that he was instructed to obtain a definite reply as soon as possible. An audience was fixed for early on March 2nd. the King remains to be seen. In the meantime a further meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee has taken place to consider certain Air Ministry su^estions as to the action which may be called for on the part of His Majesty’s Government if Ibn Saud proves recalcitrant and His Majesty’s Government decide that it is necessary to employ forcible means in order to secure their desiderata. After exhaustive discussion of the various alternatives, the conclusions flagged-were reacned.

' Ai ’ Ihe general feeling cf the meeting was that if Ibn Sand’s reply is decidedly unsatisfactory it may be necessary to take drastic measures below - either U) “ **“ •* «» or alternatively (2) Active coercive measures on the lines indicated in Air Ministry Memorandum (M.E.(O) 2), viz;! (a) In the event of intelligence revealing' the piesence of any Nejd tribes grazing within the northern or middle area of the Wadi Sirhan, a lorce of armoured cars with T.J.F.F, supported bv aircraft reconnaissance will round up the tribes ano crive off any Howaitat camels or others up to the numbers of those looted (i.e. 800).

(b) In the more likely event of the withdrawal of heja tribes during this period of strained relations, Kaf to be occupied by a force of armoured cars and Transjordan Frontier Force supported by aircraft. The Committee decided to invite the Secretary of State for India, if he considers it necessary, to consult the Government of India immediately as to the probable effect of these projected measures on Indian Moslem opinion. Pending further information as to Ibn Saud’s reception of the representations made by Sir Andrew Ryan, the Committee are unable to make further recommendations.~ 1 ~ 7 s R C 3 E T K tJoLAi. copy no (mii mEog m pasRiji. dspekce ^^^^MJLSS&amp;CraailTI-EE FOR QUliSTIOFS .

Government if we are to compel him to comply with our ternsu ' &lt; ^ Vvsv — In uhe first instance&gt; the Air Staff view was that a threat .should have been embodied in the note which Sir Arthur Ryan was instructed to hand to Ibn Sand* The threat they would have wished to embody* was, in effect, that unless the camels taken from the Eowatvn; in September and October were returned within a specified time, n His Majesty v s Government would take such action as they thought good to recover the loot, TT The India Office, Colonial Office and Foreign Office were definitely averse to the embodiment of any threat in view of the possible repercussions in the Moslem world and the unforeseeable magnitude that punitive measures might assume. In any case, they insisted that a threat was a matter which only the Cabinet could sanction. In this connection, Sir Arthur Ryan had stated in his telegram Ho, 35 to the Foreign Office dated the 18th February., 1931, TT Unless you contemplate drastic punitive action in the event of.refusal on delay, I doubt efficacy of couching our demands in extreme terms In view of Hedjaz Government T s counter-accusation and similar insistence on the return of loot. Doubtless you willalso. d--aAK e;r 0: ^ cr^ea'tixig 'unfavourable atmosphere for ' impending Iraq negotiations^ . (6~&amp; \i/h list j therefore, the Departments referred to take the line that any threat uo I bn Sand is a matter of great gravity, the -Aar Staff, although not minimising the seriousness of the situation, feel that the occasion is one on which, provided a firm and prompt line of action is taken, Ibri Sand will realise the futility of bluff and accede to our just demands. They do not regard the threat as one of aggression against the Ncjd-Hedjaz involving Tt drastic punitive action”, but urge that it should take the form of a clear indication that, since Ibn Saud is either unwilling or unable to make just reparation for the depredations of his tribes and unless he chows a definite purpose to implement Articles 3 and 5 of \ the Hadda Agreement, Holic Government propose themselves to adjust matters by such means as appear to them most likely to ensure expeditious settlement of their claims. For these reasons, the Air Staff do not regard the threat that EUM* Government proposes ”to take such action as they think good to recover the loot” as being on a par with a punitive expedition which implies definite agressive measures such as ?T drastic punitive action” against recalcitrants such as, it is thought, that the other interested Departments visualise as being foreshadowed or likely to natericilisi**g m this case. On the contrary, the measures proposed by the Air Staff are definitely such as to reduce the chance of bloodshed to a minimum and, moreover, whilst they are designed to shoo Ibn Saud that H.M. Government are in earnest in their determina tion to protect Transjordan tribes, the steps taken will be such as to make it abundantly clear that aggression in the full sense of the term is not their '.intention. - 2 -on In conformity with the foregoing, the acti proposed by the Air Staff would be (a) I of t ^r V tjpM of yteni g ence revealing the presence carfln'h 6 ? Wadi ' f ° rce of loured car., with T°JoFoi &lt; 0 supported by aircraft oti any Hov»a:.uat oamels or others up to the tfbfh h h ° + n 1 ° 0ted (i -e. 800), These camels to he held by the Transjordan Administration as postages against the return of those stolen from the Howaitat. (b) In the more likely event of the withdrawal of Held rr.bes during this period of strained relations, :i: ad occupied by a fa^ ce of armoured cars and iransjordan Frontier Force supported by aircraft. ihis latter course, apart from the dislocation of the thriving salt trade between Kaf and Jauf, would be a very severe blow to the prestige of Ibn Saud and one calculated, in the opinion of the Air Staff, to cause him to comply with our demands. In additions Kaf commands the northern part of the Wadi Sirhan and would thus deny grazing to liejd tribes in this area* Provided the occupation of Kaf is conducted as a surprise operation, the likelihood of bloodshed is almost neglibible. There is one fact which must be borne in mind when considering any active measures against Ibn Saud and that is the vulnerability to counter measures to which those Transjordan tribes, which, at this time of year graze in the Tadi Sirhan., are exposed. Is a forerunner, therefore, to the steps which the Air Staff propose, it will be necessary first to recall all Transjordan tribes well within Transjordan borders. In these circumstances, it must be pointed out that an inevitable delay will occur even after the decision ua,s been taken to sanction a threat before the threat can be translated into action.In the unlikely contingency that Ibn Saud might take active counter measures against our forces at Kaf or any of our posts, Maan or Amman, or against Transjordan tribes, the Air Staff are or the opinion that the air and armoured car forces in falestme and Transjordan reinforced, if necessary, by mechanised units of the Transjordan Frontier Force are sufficiently strong to deal with any retaliatory action that Ibn Saud might take. m addition, reinforcement from Egypt by ono flight of heavy transport aircraft would prove a valuable aid to desert operations. In cone lust on, as the Air Staff have already pointed out, it is their considered opinion that a display of firmness on the part of H.M. Government will convince Ibn Saud that they are determined to carry out their Mandatory obligations towards the Transjordan tribes. The contingency of retaliatory action against British forces just referred to they consider remote, especially as Ibn Saud is well acquainted with the potentialities of modern weapons, armoured cars and aircraft. In these circumstances, they further and consider it unnecessary to envisage/more drastic punitive action at this stage. Air Staff,7^^ ^ &amp; CDAiELj.i'£-dj i-ciE under ooiisid€rat»ion tlie draft)s of x' three teiegicuiis (A) ,; (ii) and (G) which it was proposed /C'? should he sent by the Foreign Office to Sir A. Ryan ; the British Represent at 1 %'e at Jedda, dealing with the question of raids by Hedjan tribes into Trans-Jordania. ivLH. RANDAL explained that the question of the situation on tne Frans jo rdan-Hediaz Ncjd frontier had hitherto been considered departmentally. It appeared probable, however, that certain points would now have to be referred to the Cabinet Committee for co-ordinating policy in the Near East, It had therefore seemed desirable to call a meeting of the standing official Sub-Committee, to be attended also by the representatives of the Departments with whom the matter had hitherto been discussed, in order that, if necessary, recommendations to the Cabinet Committee might be made without delay. Decisions were new required on two main issues. The first was whether any communication to be made to Ibn Saud or the Hedjazi Government should be accompanied oy a threat, and il so, by what threat. The second was the method which should be adopted to mane the necessary communication at Jedda. As regards the question of a threat, Mr. Rendel reminded the meeting that it had been agreed at the inter-departmental conference of February 2nd that no threat should then be made, and the original draft communication to the Ilecgazi Government telegraphed to Sir A. Ryan on February 6 th therefore contained no threat, The Air Ministry were now strongly pressing for the inclusion in the communication wnien it /vas proposed make to the Hetdazi Government of a definite threat that we would use force if the looted camels were not returned. The India Office considered that a threat, which His Majesty's Government might not be prepared to implement, would do more harm than good, and, in view of the importance of the reper cussions which the implementing of such a threat might have on Moslem opinion in India and elsewhere, they wore disposed tosee strong objection to that proposal. Mr. Rendel explained that the Foreign Office had always been opposed to the idea of a threat, and desired to support the India Office objections. It was clearly undesirable to use a threat unless His Majesty's Government were prepared to carry it out but it would be impossible to guarantee that any military operations in the Wadi Sirhan would be localised. They might not only prove unsuccessful but lead to a general conflagration, and the Foreign Office could only contemplate such a possibility with grave misgiving. m any case it would be quite impossible for the Foreign Office to agree to a throat being made (since this would imply a contingent concurrence in the eventual use of force) without the definite approval of tho Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, as Mr. Henderson would not be back in England for several days at least, it would be impossible to obtain this approval in time to include the proposed threat in the communication now proposed. Mr. Rendel understood moreover that the India Office would not be prepared to concur in the proposed threat without the sanction of the Cabinet or the Cabinet Committee on the Middle East. He therefore suggested that the question of the threat to be made, or the ultimate sanctions to be applied, should be left over for subsequent discussion and eventual submission to the Cabinet Committee, and that the question of the communication now to be made to the Hc^jazi G-cvernment should dealt with separately. AIR COMMODORE BURHETT (D.C.A.S.) stated that the Air Ministry had suggested an alternative course of action to a threat at this stage which met with the concurrence of the India Office. He suggested that in .telegram (B) the following should be included -'Having regard, however, to the urgent necessity and evident justice of restoring to the Transjordan tribes the large number of camels looted during September and October in the exceptionally unjustifiable circumstances referred are prepared to above, His Majesty’s Government (feel convinced that) should the Hedjaz Government find themselves faced with any practical difficulty in the to offer immediate restitution of loot, (they will welcome) the co-operation of British assistance in the Wadi Sirhan to secure a speedy settlement.” Brackets represent original wording. Pinal wording is as written above brackets^/ BIB. FLOOD said that he had spoken to Sir Samuel Wilson. It had not been possible to submit the matter to Lord Passfield, but Sir Samuel Wilson had stated that he could not agree to the insertion of any threat without the approval of the Secretary of State. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office were concerned in this question only in its most general aspect, viz., possible political reactions in India. The alternative now suggested by the Air Ministry was one which was unobjectionable from their point of view, and which they were prepared to accept. In form, at any rate, it was an offer of assistance on our part to Ibn Saud to recover the camels and not an intimacion that we might contemplate .crossing his border without consent. If Ibn Saud refused the offer, he might dt any rate feel obliged to indicate that he was prepared to make his own arrangements Apart from this, if -2 A-(3) stronger action should ultimately he necessary against nin and papers had to bo laid, our position would be stronger both in this country and in India if we could ehOn that v,e had first taken every possible step to 168.0x1 an 8 .co oihliocl at;ion in a fniGndiy way© nii-L pLiiiliDdiili stated that the Foreign Office would not oojeot to this although it was most improbable that Ibn Saud would agree &amp; 'There was however one danger. if ip^i Saud should agree to British forces crossing the frontier he would almost certainly only do so on condition that his forces were allowed into Transjordan* This would raise the whole question of right of armed pursuit acrwss the frontier which had already been discussed in connexion with raiding on the liejd-Iraq frontier. The question on that occasion had been left somewhat in the air, as we had returned no reply to Ibn Saud T s claim to be granted the reciprocal right to send his forces into Iraq. It was agreed that this question could be considered further if and when Ibn Baud's reply was received or in connexion with the subsequent discussion in regard to sanctions. AIB COmiODOHE BUKNETT ashed that the question of measures to recover the loot be considered by a Cabinet Committee, so that should action oe required, some definite proposal could be made. HR. HSHDEi agreed that the hypothetical question of what measures might be necessary to enforce th^ return of the stolen camels couj -1 oe considered, xcr sub- reference , if necessary, to the ministerial/committee. Any question of ultimate sanction raust., i-.c.. u - 1 , bi. considered by that Committee.MR* LXITffi/AlTE pointed out that Ihn Sand would be in Jedda to-morrow, 2Gth February. Sir Andrew P.yan could see him at onoe and would be in a nositior to report on his attitude in the near in cure &lt;, iiH, KSNDEL stated that as regards sanctions, if Sir Aa By an reported that Ion Baud's reply was un*~ satisfactory it would strengthen the arguments for obtaining authority to coereive measures 0 As regards the procedure, the original proposal — had been to telegraph to Jedda the tent of a note from His Majesty's Government for Sir A* Ryan to haul to the Hedjazi Government a Sir A. Ryan had now,, in his telegram No., 42, definitely recommended that he should be authorised to deal with the matter orally will the Zing.

Sir L. Oliphaat joined the meeting and after some further discussion it was agreed that this compromise should he adopted. Sir A* Ryan being authorised, if he thought it desirable. to Teavp w » - ave a copy 01 the meraorandum with the King AIR COi&amp;IODORE DtJRHETT urged that the reference to Ibn laud's personal complicity in the raids should be retained. IQ. KSHPEL said that he would much prefer that thxs should be omitted* Sir A. Byan had put forward strong objections on this point f and even if the King knew he was guilty h* would demand full explanations. In these were given we should have to refer to the sources of our information which would be most embarrassing* If they were withheld our position might prove even more awkward. In any case to make this accusation at this stage would not further a settlement, might produce a fatal personal reaction on the King himself and obscure the main issue, which was to obtain some kind of early settlement on the frontier. It was eventually agreed that the point should not be pursued. CONGIBSIONS: It was agreed: ( 1 ) m 0 telegraph a verbatim memorandum for Sir A* Ryan to give orally to Ibn Saud in. such form as he thought fit, but in no case in any weaker terms than drafted. He might leave a copy of this memorandum, with Ibn baud should he consider it desirable. (2) To instruct Sir a reply within representat 10 ns by Monday next, A.

It was considered that there might be some delay owing to the necessity of the Trans-Jordan authorities referring to G-lubb, who might be in the desert. It was agreed that a telegram should be sent to the High Commissioner, Trans-Jordan urging expedition and suggesting that an aeroplane might be used if necessary to accelerate communication.

His Majesty's Goverment are convinced that such early meeting for disposal of claims since August 1 st and ex- cnange of information regarding the present state of affairs is only means of removing grievances and suspicions on both sides,end bringing about improvement of present dangerous situation* 5- As Yusuf Yasin has recognized there has recently been a short lull in raiding. As regards raiding from Trans jordan, this lull was due to the increased effectiveness of the new measures for the control of the Transjordan tribes of wrach information has already been given to the Hejazi Gov ernment. The Transjordan authorities cannot,however,guarantee to maintain this situation unless immediate steps as proposed above are taken to arrange for return to Transjordan of the large number of camels (about 800)which have been taken in raids by Hejazi or Nejdi tribes since August 1st,and most of wnich are,or at any rate were until recently,known to be grazing in the immediate vicinity of the frontier. The fact uhao this loot has not been returned and that measures of Transjordan Government prevent Transjordan tribesmen from re. covering it by force is naturally greatly resented by latter, o« Their resentment ie aggravated, by the following facts connected with these raids which have been brought to n otdce of His Majesty's Goverrment and have made a deplorable impression on them. (a) by all Arab standards raiding should have ceased while Mr. Macdonnell's tribunal was in session. Large Nejd ralj - of Sepoemoer 17un, onree days after opening session,is therefore regarded in Transjordan as a particularly flagrant act of treachery. (b)3# (Id) as a result of preventive measures taken by His Rjesty’s Government, such Transjordan frontier raids against Hejaz-Nejd as have taken place since August 1st have been of minor character, but the raids from Nejd in Septembei* and October were of large dimensions with the result that the trioes under British protection are now threatened with ruin and starvation. (c) it is generally known on both sides of the frontier that el Neshmi while Governor of Jauf openly encouraged the Bejd tribes to raid and took a share in the loot* Latter fact was admitted by Hejaz-hejd Agent during Mr. Macdonnell's investigation, percentage of looted camels retained by Hejaz- Nejd officials being more than once quoted as evidence of amount of loot actually captured. El Neshmi also stated publicly that King Ibn Saud permitted raiding Into Transjordan. Latter statement has found wide credence and has not been effectively disproved. His Majesty’s Government are glad to learn that el Neshmi has been removed from governorate of Jauf and to receive denial contained in Yusuf Yasin’s letter to Sir A. Ryan of 18th February respecting truth of recent reports regarding preparations for a raid by el Neshmi at end of Ramazan. The evidence referred to above of el Neshmi's activities before his removal from the governorate of Jauf is of a different character from these recent reports and so circumstantial and definite that His Majesty's Government have no choice but to accept it as true that during a considerable period when he was the chief official in the neighbourhood he was inciting the tribes to raid and sharing in the loot. This constitutes a flagrant infractioninfraction of Hadda Agreement and it is deplorable that such action should have been taken by an official of the Hejazi Government when that government had before them a detailed memorandum from His majesty's Government urging the closest co-operation between the local authorities on the two sides of the frontier. ills Majesty's Government must press that, if this has not already been done, the strongest measures should be taken uo counteract me effect of el Neshmi's action in giving countenance to raiding, and to make it publicly known that King Ibn Baud expressly disavows and condemns it. His Majesty's Government m)dt have now been informed that el Neshmi has been appointed to command tribal forces with headquarters at Jauf. In view of his previous record they trust that tills report will prove unfounded. 7. His Majesty's Government request therexore that Hejazi Government will inform them at an early date that they agree to proposal for meeting between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid and that they will invest the latter with full poweis to deal with the matters proposed including the immediate restitution of the camels and other loot taken from Transjordan tribes since August 1st. Captain Glubb will also be authorised to arrange for the restitu tion of loot identified as having been taken from He;jazi or Nejdi tribes. 3.

Transjordan authorities are ready in the same spirit of cooperation to receive and reply to reports regarding impending raids which may be referred to Captain Glubo ey Ton Zeid or to Transjordan Government through Sir A.

I think we can ignore the tone of Yusuf yasin's reply as it is merely a tactless echo of my own very categorical language and Hejaz government are being studiously polite in other directions. Ky letter has Probably served its immediate pur pose of imposing caution on Ibn Saud in the Insnedlate xuture. it is clear however that he will not give way as regards camel looting in October except under the strongest pressure and he may easily again postpone bringing into operation of Article 3 if he is told that direcu communj.cation must be with Glubb and especially if it is added as suggested in Transjordan telegram No. 15 that all meetings after the first should take race in Hejaz territory. It would be futile to continue personal corres pondence. in my opinion the choice lies between action suggested in penultimate paragraph of my telegram No. 35 or communication of a strong memorandum drawn up by uis Majesty's Government themselves. I still prefer the former course. If the latter is adopted it seems necessary (a) that we should be absolutely certain of2 . mi our ground and clear in our minds that the King has no counter-case worth considering and (h) that His Majesty’s Government should have clear view of their further action in the almost certain event of Hejaz government failing to give full and immediate satis faction, In that case I consider that the only ef fective means of pressure would he to tahe punitive action or to withdraw me temporarily doth of which would he very drastic remedies. Attitude of Hejaz government is further illustrated hy note summarized in my telegram No. 43 which, though much more polite in form, in effect revives the old suggestion that if His Majesty’s Government cannot put an end to raids from Transjordan, Ihn Baud and his tribes should have a free hand.

JO- I have received note from Minister for Foreign Af fairs dated February 22nd beginning with polite reference to my enquiries during his recent illness and expressing regret that his first business on resumption of work should be to complain of fresh raids. He then complains of two raids by Transjordan tribes on February 10th and February 13th. In the first case party believed to be Beni Atiya captured forty camels whereupon one of the raided party went to seen help of nis relations in pursuing raiders. In second case party of TransJordanians looted thirty-four camels and people raided went with their partisans in pursuit with results unknown. I am telegraphing full details to Transjordan which will doubtless be forwarded to them in usual way. Note ends with reference to raid mentioned in Transjordan telegram No. 11 which is being investigated and with general observations of which following is sum mary. Begins: If matters remain in this state situation will take greater extension. Important thing is oo know whether this will not inconvenience His Majesty's Government themselves and cause (?gr.omit.) between them. Otherwise the matter is simple as we know Transjordan Bedouins andthey know us and we can settle with them sooner or later. If, however, your government are concerned to stop raids owing to inconvenience to themselves please state what mutual measures should he taken to prevent them completely. Failing this interposition of British between parties constitutes troublesome problem because it is difficult for us either to see our tribes entangled with British forces or to refuse them our protection, i impatiently await suggestions of your government because measures hitherto taken have not produced the slightest effects and immunity of raiders encourages them in evil actions.

Following is summary; begi Your severe indictment of heshmi based on rumours, of falsity of which I have assured you, causes astonish ment. Neshmi never did anything but try to maintain security in area for which he was responsible. At the same time you resent, and say that your government will resent, accusations against Glubb who immediately on arrival filled the area with confused and untrue rumours. Mnister for Foreign Affairs assured you in note to which I referred of falsity of first rumour and I assured you in my subsequent note of baselessness of report regarding raid expected at the end of Ramazan. I once more assure you that fresh information received by Ugh Commissioner is groundless. No money was distributed; no tribesmen assembled at Alula with or without standards; no prospect was held out of a raid on Transjordania after February 27th. All such reports f als e• If you and your government grasp the fact that all this information is baseless and designed to cause disturbance...hU disturbance similar to that known to hav before from Glubb's action pt* wi 11 -h ^ uu uicu, Known to nave resulted o action matter will be easy and your government will nave no occasion to resent formula tion of accusations against that officer who has filled Transjordania with fear and alarm. xis regaxus measures suggested by you for improve ment of the situation my views are these. A. You reQUest return oi camels looted from Howeitat in October. If you had said in this connexion tnat camels captured by Transjordanian tribes since the beginning of the MacDonnell enquiry most of v/hich are at Gluob’s disposal would be returned simultaneously request would be just and equitable and you would find us ready to comply. B. I have already informed you orally that we are prepared to consider suggestions you thinh best for bringing article 3 of Hadda agreement into operation. C. If you will refer to the early portion of this letter and realize falsity of reports you will see there is no need for preventive measures because there are no preparations for raids requiring them. In our recent conversation I shared your views that co-operation would prevent discord and dispute. I am sure that you will agree on your side that acceptance of false information, as being will do more to disturb minds on frontier than to calm them. I mention this so that you may draw attention of your government to it in order that they may restrain their officials from disturbing and useless actions. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 41.

Yours sincerely,I'OREIGM OFFICE, S.W.l. 23rd February 1931 y Following on our conversations over the telephone about Kyan's telegrams hos. 35 and 36 on the subject of the Transjordan-Hejaz-Eej&amp; frontier situation, I send you herewith three draft telegrams to Jedda which we have prepared in reply and which have been provisionally approved by our higher authorities here, subject to your concurrence. You will see that we propose to adopt the method suggested by Hyan himself in the final paragraph of his telegram Ho. 35 and to send him by telegram the text of a note or memorandum for him to communicate verbatim to the Hejazi Government. We feel that after all that has passed during the last few weeks this will be the best method of putting the position forcibly to the Hejazis and we hope you will concur. The Air Ministry have .again sfrongly pressed us * 1 v J. G. Laithwaite Esq to-2- to include in our communication a definite threat that we weuic^ go and fetch the Howeitat camels ourselves unless the Hejazi Government would give us satisfaction. You will see that the possibility of using this threat is dealt with in the first of the three draft telegrams which I enclose. But we feel that the objections to using this threat at this stage are no less serious than they were when it was first proposed at the Inter-Departmental conference of February 2, and that there is the further disadvantage that if it were now made the camels would almost certainly be immediately removed from such points in hejdi territory as are accessible to our armoured cars, etc., so that we might merely end oy reducing the chances of effective action should it prove necessary to take such action later on. On the other hand you will see that, while, in deference to Ryan’s strongly expressed recamendations, we have placed the question of cooperation,on the lines of the Hadda Agreement, in the forefront of our camunication, we have closely followed the lines of our original telegrams (Bos. 20, 21 and 22) of Feoruary 6 to Ryan, of which copies were sent to you officially (in our printed letter Bo. E 615/387/25) at the time. I. • • •I hope that you may he able to concur in the enclosed drafts without serious modification, and if so I hope we may be able to get them sent off early to-morrow.

In paragraphs three and four of my Note I have made use of the information contained in Your Excellency's despatch of November 25 and your two d espatches of December 31 all numbered 735/89 and have referred to my previous Note of January 3, based on your despatch of December 16 under the same number.

I have not gone into details as in the first case the loot had not been recovered up to the time of Colonel Cox 1 ® report although the raiders have been punished, and in the second case it was con sidered doubtful whether effective action could fee taken.

I agree also as to continued importance of of disavowal and punishment. Your further statement regarding public knowledge of incitement to raid partly removes my objection to Government still have to appraise in judicial capacity the value of all evidence given to investigation and might do better not to commit themselves explicitly to acceptance of it at this stage. I still feel very strongly that direct accusation against the King however justified by secret informa tion would do more harm than good. You will remember I narrowly escaped acute quarrel with him when I wrote to him in July about this frontier question. His conscience may be guilty but he is quite clever enough to repudiate charge of personal complicity and ask reasons for it. Neshm^ but Ibn Sand can invoke his dismissal as proof using this argument. My point was that His Majesty T s InIn Vlew of He J a2 Government's counter accusation eiiia Slrnilar lnsistenc e on the return of loot I doubt exxicacy of couching our demand, in extreme terms unless you contemplate drastic punitive action in the evviit Ox refusal or delar.

On the other hand I felt on February 17th that further papers referred to in paragraph 1 above necessitated action oj. some kind before Moslem festival which begins 19th Feoruary, I therefore addressed personal letter to i usof lasin. Part 2 of my immediately following teu.egx cin gives full summary with the exception of polite phrases which attenuate it only slightly, iv.y letter is fairly strong.

Following are sunxnaries mentioned in my immediately preceding telegram. Part 1. Yusuf Yasin’s note to me of February 15th. Begins:- Raid recently complained of by Hejaz Government probably took place between February 3rd and February 7th. I have read with surprise report of Neshmis* projected raid. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on January 25th and I have since spoken to you about falsity of similar previous rumour. I can assure you that new rumour is equally false. Neshmi| has been dismissed and has no further connexion with Governor of Jauf. I remind you of what I said about attitude of officer imported from Iraq. He evidently wishes to create state of disturbance on Trans Jordanian frontier similar to that produced by his earlier activities in Iraq. First consequences are these false rumours and reports received by ny Government that on arrival he started collecting camels looted from our tribes and usingdsin^ them in hl.s work instead of returning them. s»e Ccimou aaimt such action and 'believe your Government wi11 not allow it. Please ask authorities concerned to do the necessary to avoid crisis; to put a stop to false rumours; and to ensure return of csmels belonging uo our trioesmen which have been collected in Transjordania. Ends. Part 2. % personal letter to Yusuf Yasin of February 17th. Begins I prefer to reply privately to your note which raises two immediate important points. 1. Report to v/hich I drew attention on February 12th was new end could not be disposed of by answer regarding similar earlier report. I realised that Neshmi^ was no longer governor. His dismissal of which I heard with satisfaction does not end his activities. It would be a great boon to remove him from the frontier region. 2. I see no foundation for accusation against Glubb. Ivy Government will strongly resent such accusations based on mere (? supposition) directed against specially selected officer. I have now received even more serious report. (Here follows paraphrase of Transjordanian telegram No. 12). I cannot conceal the perturbation of ny Government though I prefer to say this by private letter pending instructions. Howeitat are in great misery owing to non-return • • •»•non-return of carnels taken Hejaz and Nejd G-overnments in Octo'Der raids of which hod advance knowledge though they were too late to prevent them. In my personal opinion situation can only he prevented from hecoming dangerous hy (1) immediate return of those camels (2) immediate bringing into operation of Article 3 of Hadda agreement (3) very strong measures hy King to prevent preparations for further raids into Transjordenia. Our recent conversation filled me with hope better things. I consider still that closer co operation on frontier and direct exchange of inf tion would result in less danger of further raid Ox orma- s and less difference of opinion as to value of reports received hy both sides.

To HEJAZ-NEJD . Cypher telegram to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda), Foreign Office. 13th February, 1S31. No. 26. 11.30 p.n. Your telegrams Nos. 27 and 28 (of the 10th February: proposed protest to Hejazi Government on raiding situa- tion) • Although my telegrams Nos. 20, 21 and 22 were 4 c t7 GI &gt; -fi 7 * drafted before receipt of your telegram No. 24 and of your despatch No, 25, these did not appear to necessitate any modification in policy already decided on. Recent detailed reports contained in Transjordan despatch No. 4640 of the 3rd January (copy to you by beg of February 5th) show necessity of obtaining immediate restoration to Howeitat of loot taken since August 1st, and this is unlikely to be achieved except by strong representations on lines proposed. I had not overlooked points which you raise in paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of your telegram. As regards (b) raids of September and October are main subject of complaint, which is directed more to particularly disgraceful features of these raids referred to in paragraph 3 (a), (c) and id) of my telegra. No. 20 than merely to their size or fact of their occur rence. His Majesty’s Government have only recently been informed of seriousness of these raids and of gravity of consequent situation in Transjordan, Paragraph ...(2). Paragraph 2 (c) jf your telegram. There seems no reason to refrain from complaining of acus of ilesumi because he has since ceased to he Governor of Jauf. Paragraph 3 (1) of your telegram. Transjordan authorities state categorically that it is common knoA- ledge on both sides of frontier that Neshmi publicly encouraged raiding and Nejdi raiders made no attempt to conceal fact. This statement is reinforced liy our knowledge that at least one raid was directly ordered by Ibn Saud himself. Paragraph 3 (2). Hejazi agent himself made admission to Macdonnell and I see no- reason why it snould not be quoted. As regards personal accusation against King, know ledge that His Majesty's Government are aware of his instructions t-» raid should surely have salutary expect on His Majesty, who, while no doubt denying statement, will realize its truth and may hesitate to repeat pro ceedings. I appreciate yrur arguments, but more vigorous measures than polite protest seem essential if immediate return of loot taken from Howeitat is to oe secured. My own inclination then is still to address note to Hejazi Government or to King himself substanti.axxy an outlined in my telegrams Nos. 20, 21 and 22, while leaving you discretion to defer action pending receipt of details in Transjordan despatch of January 3rd and to make such minor changes an may be necessary to bring your representations into harmony with recent develop- merits ...—-developments, especially with your recent conversation with Yusuf Yasin regarding Article 3 of Hadda Agreement. If, however, after weighing above considerations you adhere to opinion that situation would he aggravated by such vigorous protest as originally drafted, I ,shall not take amiss further representations by you, before giving you final instructions.

In the absence of reference I am uncertain whether you had received my telegram No.24 end my despatch No. 25 before despatching telegrams under reference. In view of more favourable turn taken !y discussions here I fear any attempt to force the pace to the extent contemplated in your instructions may do more harm than good. I venture to draw attention to- the following considerations; (a) Nejaz Government took prompt action regarding raid of September 17th and eighty odd camels were restored, remainder being claimed as property of Neidis. I understand this was the same raid regarding which resident Amman expressed satisfaction in report to High Commission of September 30th. In subsequent report of November 5th he stated that balance of one hundred and seventeen camels was still outstanding but I have not yet received detailed criticism of statemenus -*-n ^.iimster for Foreign Affairs 1 note enclosed in my despatch No.289. (b) Analysis of protests show Trans Jordanians completed of four raids including above as moving occur red from August to December and Hejaz Government complajn- edcomplained rightly or wrongly of fourteen for the seme period. irennJordan!a complained of none in Novernher and -^ecember; Hejaz of only one in December. Unless tnere has been serious recrudescence since January 1st gravity of situation would appear not to consist in the present raid but in sufferings of Koweitat in conse quence of October raids. (c) If person described as Governor of Jauf is Neshrni he seems to have been dismissed judging by what Yussuf told ire and High Commissioner’s telegram to me No.7 repeated to Colonial Office No,9. I should be glad of any further information from Amman regarding his present position. Contents of your telegram No.32 seem to be affected by rry telegram No.24 and by action which I have already taken regarding October raids on mowsitat as recorded in my despatch No.25. I do not quite see on what one can base statement that Hejez Government have now public ly en cour a ged attack on Transjordanian tribes unless (one) there has been some recent public incitement of which I am unaware, or (two) the liejas agent was party to admission by 9 Hejaz representative^ during NacDonneli enquiry and His Majesty’s Government regard such admission in the course of the proceedings which are still sub judice as constituting public encouragement. The fact that His majesty’s Government themselves occupy judicial position seems to me to make it un desirable that they should use evidence given at investigation in this wayI suggest sufficient immediate action would be to .ui^te j. urine r note with reference to recent conversation c,gc-.in urging importance of restitution of loot taken from Howeitat and proposing early meeting between Captain Gluob and Abdulaziz. ('R M ends) ' 0v ' • LDn Saud appears to be more amenable personal accusation against him, which we could not substantiate without disclosing nature of our inform ation, could in rry opinion only envenom the situation. In any case it would be difficult not to reveal by inference actual raids we have in mind as they could only be those which occurred in September and October unless there have been further raids this year regarding which you have similar information.

R he gljig: - Reports received from British officer recently appointed to necluin Control Board (see paragraph 6 (a) of memorandum in my despatch No. 360 of October 2nd last) show that situation in frontier districts of Transjordan has become exceedingly grave. its a result of raids from Hejaz-Nejd culminating in serious attacks in September and October important sections of Koweitat tribe of Transjordan, having lost most of their camels, are in state of acute distress and in many cases are on verge of starvation. About 000 Transjordan camels have been taken since august 1st,,most of which are, or at any rate were until recently, known to be gracing in Nejdi territory in vicinity of frontier but increasingly effective measures introduced by His Majesty’s Government to prevent raiding from Transjordan into Nejd preclude Howeitat from recovering them. Meanwhile situation has been much aggravated by following facts: (a) By all Arab standards raiding should have ceased while Mr. Macdonnell’s tribunal was actually In session. Large Mejd raid of September 17th, three days after opening session, is therefore regarded in TransjordanTransjordan as particularly flagrant act of treachery. (°) a res dlt of effective preventive measures tuuen hy his Majesty’s Government, such Transjordan counter-raids against Hejaz-Nejd as have taken place since august 1st have been of very minor character, but raius from Nejd have oecome of increasing importance, vion result that trices under British protection are now threatened with ruin and starvation* (c ) It is now generally known on both sides of one frontier that Governor of Jauf is openly encouraging Nejdis to raid and is talcing a share of the loot. Latter fact was openly admitted by Hejaz-Nejd representatives to Mr. Macdonnell during investigation, and percentage of looted camels retained by Ibn Baud’s officials was more than once quoted as evidence of amount of loot actually taken. Governor has also publicly stated that Ibn Baud has now permitted raiding into Transjordan, (d) His Majesty’s Government have recently obtained definite evidence that at least one important raid was carried out on direct instructions from Ibn £&gt;aud himself. End of Fa Provided statement is kept in this form, and actual raid and source of information are not divulged, I have no objection to your making this statement, which is of great import ance, to Hejaz Government, notwithstanding instruction to the contrary in my despatch No. 497 of December 29th. H begins; ~ His Majesty’s Government take most serious view of3 of above situation. . They had hoped that holding of Macdonnell enquiry and institution of measures to check raiding from Transjordan and renewed appeal for institution of corresponding measures and for co operation on part of Kejasi government contained in memorandum in my despatch No. 360 of October hnd would produce favourable response. There has been no response from Hejazi government e On the contrary they have now publicly encouraged attacks on Transjordan tribes. Grave danger to prosperity of Transjordan tribes makes it essential that situation should be remedied without delay* appointment of Captain Glubb as British Intelligence Officer on Tribal Control Board renders it possible to deal with situation in accordance with spirit of Article 3 of Hadda Agreement, end His Majesty’s Government must call on Ibn Saud to fulfill his obliga tions under that article. They therefore propose that Captain Glubb should proceed forthwith to Wadi Sirhan 3 in order that immediate arrangements may be made by him for restitution of loot taken from Transjordan tribes since ..rugust 1st with the Governor of Jauf or other official fully empowered by Ibn Saud for the purpose. Captain Glubb will also be authorised to deed with claims of Hejazi and Nejdi tribes in respect of loot proved to have been taken by Transjordan tribes during the same period. His Majesty's Government can no longer acquiesce in the failure of Ibn Saud to \ meet) 4. meet his obligations under the Had da -agreement and must press him strongly to issue necessary orders to Kejazi frontier authorities, in fulfilment of Article 3 of Hadda .agreement, to co-operate with Glubb and would he glad to learn as soon as possible that this nas been done. They must, however, make it clear that they demand the immediate restitution to ,xOweitat of all camels stolen from Howeitat in course of Nejdi raids since August 1st and public withdrawal and repudiation of orders issued to flejdi officials of Jauf condoning or encouraging raids. You should at once address communication in strong terms on above lines to Hejasi government or to King Ibn Saud himself, explaining that matter is one of urgency, to which His Majesty’s Government attach great Importance.

Most of this correspondence consists of copies of letters and telegrams between the Foreign Office and the British Minister at Jedda, Sir Andrew Ryan, as well as translated copies of correspondence between Ryan and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd (later Saudi Arabia). The volume also contains India Office correspondence with the Foreign Office and Air Ministry.The correspondence is chiefly concerned with reported raids carried out on the Transjordan frontier by tribes from Nejd and Transjordan. Much of the Foreign Office correspondence discusses the efforts of the British to arrange a meeting between Captain John Bagot Glubb (recently appointed as British Intelligence Officer attached to the Transjordan Bedouin Control Board) and his counterpart, Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeid [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Zeid], in order to resolve respective claims regarding raids from August 1930 to February 1931, and to make arrangements for the future intercommunication of information.Also discussed are the following:An alleged crossing into Hejazi-Nejdi territory by British aircraft and cars from Transjordan.A proposed extradition treaty between Transjordan and the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd.Reports of meetings between Glubb and Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeid.The question of nationality in relation to certain tribes on the Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd frontier (namely the Beni Atiya [Banū ʿAṭiyya] and the Atun, which Ryan describes as being a section of the Howeitat [Banū al- Ḥuwayṭāt]).In addition to correspondence the volume contains copies of minutes from meetings in early 1931 of the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, which discuss possible measures (such as the withdrawal of the British Minister at Jedda) that the British could take in the event of Ibn Saud returning 'an unsatisfactory answer' to British demands relating to the situation on the Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd frontier. Also included are copies of memoranda from Glubb, one of which responds to complaints made against him by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Hejaz and Nejd.Other correspondents besides those already mentioned include the Secretary of State for Colonies, the Colonial Office, the High Commissioner for Transjordan (Sir John Robert Chancellor, succeeded by Arthur Grenfell Wauchope), the British Resident at Transjordan (Charles Henry Fortnom Cox), and His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires at Jedda (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill).The volume includes three dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year.
