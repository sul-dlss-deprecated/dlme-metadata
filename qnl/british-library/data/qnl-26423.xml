Transit rights for United States military aircraft* 1» The United States Etrfbaaay have infor^ied the i^orelgn Office that it la the intention of the United Stutee Government to obtain directly from the Government of Bunta in due course confirmation of the existing validity after the independence of Burma of the existing arrangements. They have asked that wo will convey to the appropriate Bumese authorities at an early date the substance of the agreement insofar ae it relates to Buraia in order to facilitate direct conversations between the United Utates and Burmese authorities. 2 0 on the assumption that Ministers have not yet been informed of the arrangement it neems possible that to mention the matter to them at the eleventh hour in the way suggested might provoke suspicion, whereas if they coins to learn of it simply as an exist lag arrangement which the new Government of Burma might reasonably be expected to continue on tho‘transfer of power, it would not be called in question. On the!other hand, we do not want to provoke any suspicion in the mind of the Bormans that there may be agreements or undertakings which have not been communicated to them and which may come to notice only gradually, &amp;a occasion arises 9 after the transfer of power. There ie no other agreement, so far as we are aware, of this nature, and that is perhaps strong argument for informing them quite frankly and at once* 3. \io shall be grateful for your views. If in your Judgment wioe course would be at once to iafom Thakin Nu or Tin Tut of position as suggested by Americans, you have full discretion to do so. If, on the other hand, you wish to discuss tactics further before taking action, please do not hesitate to come baok* Tow will real lee from paragraph 3(g) of our telegram 3206 of 10th August, 1946, that we took stops to safeguard the rights of independent Buraia in the mnttsr, and indeed this is doubtless the reason why the Americans intend to raise the question with the Government of Burma. 4.

Sir, I am directed to refer to the aide memo ire dated 21st July, 1947, which was placed by the Deputy High Ccraraissioner for the United Kingdom in India before the Hon’ble Member for External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations in the late Government of India. The aide memo ire reads asfbllows:- M It is understood that, at a recent meeting of the Partition Council, His Excellency the Viceroy mentioned that it would be necessary for His Majesty's Government to come to sane arrangement with India and Pakistan in regard to defence matters. 2. General negotiations for such an arrangement cannot be initiated at the moment and in any event will take time to conclude. There is however one issue which requires immediate consideration: it is that of the continuance of facilities for the transit of military aircraft engaged in carrying mail, troops and Government passengers to and from the Par East. His Majesty’s Government regard it as essential that there should be no break in the continuity of these facilities, and trust that it will be found possible to reach an agreement in the matter forthwith. 3. The air routes in question are:- (a) that now flown by long range aircraft via Mauripur to Ceylon and thence to Singapore; and (b) that for short range aircraft via Mauripur - Palam - Dum Dum to the Par East. 4. The facilities which His Majesty’s Government seek are:- (i) continuance of the present arrangement whereby the Royal Air Force in India maintain staging posts at Mauripur and Dum Dum, and whereby the Roual Air Force in ! 9 47 /the • • •-r the Par East are permitted to operate navigational, meteorological; ^3^ emergency landing facilities at PORT BLAIR (ANDAMANS) or at CAR NICOBAR for emergency use on the long flight between CEYLON and SINGAPORE; and (ii) continuance of the present arrangement whereby the Royal Air Force and Civil Aviation in India operate radio and radar navigational aids and air traffic control on a common user basis, and whereby service aircraft are permitted to land at D.G.C.S. airfields (and civil aircraft at service airfields) in emergency or by arrangement. His Majesty’s Government therefore would be grateful for consent, in the form of a standstill agreement, to the continuation after 15th August 1947 of the existing military aircraft facilities set out above, it being understood that negotiations for their further continuance will form part of the later general negotiations about defence matters and that the standstill agreement shall hold good until such general negotiations have been concluded.” 2. ^he Government of I n dia agree, by way of a standstill agreement, to the continuance after the fifteenth of August 1 9A7 of the existing military aircraft facilities as set out in paragraph four of the aide memoire quoted above, it being understood that negotiations for their further continuance will form part of the later general negotiations about defence matters and that the standstill agreement shall hold good until such general negotiations have been concluded.

The present military routes carry mail, troops and Government passengers to destinations in the Far East. It is essential that there should be no gap in the continuity °f tlie provision of these facilities and arrangements to this end should, therefore, be concluded with the minimum of delay. Otherwise we stand to face withdrawal of facilities, involving a complete cessation of service on some routes, and in others a temporary stop ubtil alterna tives can be arranged. 2. x ^ The Viceroy has agreed that this is an issue that must be dealt with immediately. His No. 1800-S - of 7th July refers. He has suggested that you should negotiate forthwith with the Party leaders, as representing future successor authorities, with the object of obtaining their consent to continuation, after August 15th, of present facilities, in form of a stand still agreement. 3 - 4 ., 4 ., t 4,. wi] 4 y 2 u ’ therefore, initiate negotiations with the Indian leaders at an early date to secure a stand still agreement for the continuation of the existing military aircraft transit facilities after August 15th. Before opening negotiations you should consult the A.O.C. m C. and ascertain his requirements:- (a) For locating R.A.F. personnel and equipment (b) For facilities from D.G.C.A.H - 2 - to permit the continued operation of existing Military aircraft transit facilities. 4. Negotiations for the continuance of air transit rights after the expiry of the stand still agreement will form part of the general negotiations for the securing of British strategic requirements, which, it is hoped will take place later.

(2) The use of .^alam for night-stops has been agreed to only for so long as Palam remains under tlu control of the Air Forces in India. It is regretted thai. accommodation for military air crews will not be available at this airfield when it is taken over, as is intended, by the Director-General of Civil Aviation in India. .3) A copy is attached of papers relating to customs, health and^passport examination of R.A.F. aircraft. she proposal of the United States Government that the Agreement should automatically be renewed unless/-...........2 unless 6 months' notice is given by either party amounts in effect to a suggestion that this should be a permanent agreement terminable only at 6 months* notice. The Government of India regret that they do not f^el justified in entering into a tontinuing commitment of this kind at present and would prefer that the duration of the permission granted far these operations should be limited to 2 years in the first instance, subject to 6 months' notice of termination on either side. The facilities enjoyed by the U.S.A.

In practice, therefore, the places where the United States will require the facilities in question amount solely to Mellaha airfield in Tripolitania, where it would be a matter of continuing the facilities which the United states authorities already enjoyed during war time, and to a couple of airfields in Burma where the field, felngalodcn, which the Americans particularly desire to use is one in which they also had war time facilities though they made little use of them. 4. The American requests were considered in detail by the Chiefs of btaff, who attach considerable importance to concluding an arrangement on the lines proposed by the Americans, subject to certain specific conditions, and by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. These conditions were duly /putf i put to the United states authorities, who have been able to meet all of them with one exception, namely a request by us that American military aircraft passing in transit in accordance with these facilities would not carry fare- paying passengers, and that they would only carry non-fare- paying passengers travelling on duty. The best that the Americans can do on this head is to assure us that, under a regulation permitting the revenue carriage of United states Government officials and other national Interest traffic on military aircraft (which had expired on October 24th last but has been renewed for six months), such traffic can be carried only when United states Civil air services are not available, and that it is normal practice in such cases to use foreign civil airlines if available. 5. The Ministry of Civil Aviation are apprehensive on Uiiia point and, while not wishing to stand against the advantage on strategic grounds of caching agreement with the Americans, have asked us to safeguard the position as far as possible. &lt;ie should propose to do this by taking note in writing of the American assurance mentioned in paragraph 4 above, and by saying orally to the United states embassy here /thatthat we 8haU feo1 14 necessary to watch carefully the working of the agreement on this acore and, if we find that it is being abused, to request them to take steps to put matters right as otherwise we may feel bound to exercise our right to terminate the agreement. 6.

This is a matter affecting military aircraft only, 3* At a fairly early stage in the negotiations it was ascertained that the United States were in fact already carrying on negotiations direct with the Government of India in New Delhi to cover the Indian part of the scheme, and no objection was raised from the British side to the negotiations as regards India continuing through these channels. In practice, therefore, the places where the United States will require the facilities in question amount solely to Uellaha airfield in Tripolitania, where it would be a matter of c ntinuing the facilities which the United states authorities already enjoyed during war time, and to a couple of airfields in Burma where the field, Mlngalodon, which the Americans partic *larly desire to use is one in which they also had war time facilities though they made little use of them, k* The American requests were eonsiderea in detail by the Chiefs of Staff, who attach considerable importance to cincluding an arrangement on the lines proposed by the Americans, subject to cei’tain specific conditions, and by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, These conditions were duly putto the United States authorities, who have been able to meet all of thera with one exception, namely a request by us that American military aircraft passing in transit in accordance with these facilities would not carry fare paying passengers, and that they would only carry non-fare- paying passengers travelling on duty.

I feel it desirable to ask for your &amp;pprovs.l to go ahead on this basis in view of the considerations which you had in mind when examining the arrangement very recently made about reciprocal use of naval facilities. When agreeing to the arrangement regarding reciprocal naval facilities, you directed that we should not for the time being take up the Chiefs of Staffs* desire to negotiate for analogous reciprocal sviation facilities, but you agreed that there was no objection to our taking note of the readiness of the Americans, and agreeing to continue in being certain reciprocal air facilities existing as the result of the war time arrangements in various parts of the world, (these appear to be mostly eonc&lt; rned with methods for arranging clearance of flights and permission to land).

I sent you oi\ the 5th iiopteoiber a copy or my letter of the same date to Gallraan at the American lamhassy conveying the views of his Uajesty’s Government on the question of military air transit rights for the United states Government on the route to the Far iast. I now enclose a copy of his reply. 2* You will see that he makes no reference to hie last paragraph of ray letter expressing our confidence that we can count upon reciprocity should the need ever arise. We had frankly never expected that we should get a categorical agreement on this point, and v;e would favour letting thing stand without; any farther Specific approach, which would probably only result in a negative answer, . r { , 'is : . 3, The important point, owever, concerns paragraph 6 (b) of my letter (dealing, you will remember, with the question of fare-paying passengers), Gallma^s letter certainly reads as though the effect of the new order will not be extensive, and of diminishing signi ficance: nevertheless the 'national in teres t' 'may well be interpreted to include ordinary commercial interests* You will no doubt wish to consult the Ministry of Civil Aviation about this. If they consider that there is a serious risk, as the result of what the Americans now contemplate, that American commercial travellers will through the existence of this route get a substantial advantage over others, we ought perhaps to ask pretty Hadclon, Cabinet Offices, S.b.l. /stifflystiffly that the new order* shoiild not be issued. Ue recently gave the United States Military Aviation Departnent very valuable and unsolicited help in Iceland and we are entitled to expect them not to press for unfair advantages along this other route. he should nevertheless be sorry to lose the whole understanding on account of this point. It is a matter which we ought to make up our minds about rather urgently, as we are rapidly approaching the date of October 24th. 4.

As you know, the present position with regard to the former Italian Colonies is that the Council of Foreign Ministers have agreed, so far as they are concerned that, pending a definite aolu- ^Aon of the future status of these Colonies, the present British Military drainisjtration shall c ntinue. The Foreign Ministers’ Beputiea are to try to reach an agreed recommendation on the future of the territories and to report to tee Foreign Ministers.

His Majesty’s Government cannot fore tell how long their assurance will remain effective* 6* The detailed conditions referred to in paragraphs 8 and 4 above are: (a) The facilities enjoyed by the United dtates X Government shall be confined to United states military aircraft, bearing the appropriate titarvice markings and manned by service air crews in uniform and on duty; (b) In accordance with the explanation given in your letter of July 12th to me, it would be under stood that Araerican service aircr ft passing in transit in accordance with these facilities would not, as from October 24th, 1946, carry fare-paying passengers, and that they would only carry non-fare- paying official passengers travelling on duty; (c) If the scale and type of the traffic carried by the Araerican aircraft was found to be such as to lead to an increased commitment for the British aut oritiea either in personnel or construction, such increases would be subject to the agreement of the British authorities and to the readiness of the United tea Goverarent to make an adequate financial contribution; (d) The United states authorities and their air craft would normally use the radio air traffic control, raetereological facilities und other aids to navigation, provided by the loyal i * i'orce* The United Btates authorities would not install their own equipment or organisation to supplement / theseth' se services and facilities except by prior agree* raent with the British authorities; The British outhorities would be given by the United btiites authorities an estimate at' the normal and maximum traffic which it is contemplated would pass under this arrangement.

August 1946 Many thanks for your letter (to Nevile Sutler) of August 6 th in which you explained the position of the United states Government with regard to conversations with the Government of India about military air transit rights through India on the route to the Far Fast. «e have 2m he appreciate that the United states Govemroent arc anxious to conclude their negotiations for the necessary facilities on this air route as soon as possible. I am authorised to make to you the following comraunica tion regarding the territories on the projected route for which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are responsible or with which they are specially concerned. 3* fhe general osition of His Majesty’s Government is that they welcome the establishment of this American mili ary air route and will gladly do what lies in their power to help in making available the necessary facilities. As regards India, I am to say that the point made in your le$^r of the 6 th August that there is no need at present for direct intervention by His Majesty’s Government, is fully accepted and that His Majesty's Government are content that negotiations should be continued direct vitk the Government of India at Hew Delhi* Ioan, however# add that Hie Matty's Government will he glad to use their good offices with the Govern 'n of India should this prove necessary* ' 8 regaw3a ^rma# correspondence is still procee ding with the Government of Surma and I hope to be able to let you know the situation at an early date. In order# however# that the Government of Surma may be able/estimate the situation in connection with air-fields in their country, I am asked to say that it will be of particular importance to receive an estimate, in the same way ns io suggested in paragraph 6 (o) XKtsx of this letter below regarding Tripolitania, of the normal and maximum traffic which it is contem lated will paas through Burma under this arrangement, as well as to receive the longest possible prior notice of any exceptional scale of traffic. 4. Th© other territory on the projected route# wit} which His iiajesty’s Government are concerned, is Tripoli tania. ills Majesty’s Government understand that the air-field of Mellrfia in Tripoli tania is at present entirely operated by the United States authorities and I -m able to assure you that His Majesty’s Government will be glad to see the United States authorities continue# subject to the detailed conditions set out below# to enjoy facilities there so long as His Majesty’s Government remain responsible for this administrati on of the territory. you know, i the present position with regard to the former |!| Italian Colonies is that the Council of Foreign Ministers have agreed# ao far as they are concer ned that, pending a definite solution of the /futurestatus of these Colonies, the present British Military Administration shall continue. Ibe i’oreign Ministers 1 I'Cputiea are to try to reach an agreed recommendation on the future of the territories and to report to the Foreign Ministers. If the latter cannot agree within one year of the coming into force of the Treaty of tfc ce, then the four Governments agree to abide by thfe ffimtil decision of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This procedure and time-table will presumably come before the present - eace Conference in ^aris, and we cannot, 01 course, for tell what effect the discussions there may have upon it. 5. The United States Government will appre ciate therefore that, in expressing their readiness to give facilities for the United states military air route in Tripolitania, His Majesty’s Government cannot foretell how long their assurance will remain effective. 6* The detailed conditions on which this assurance is given is as follows:- (a) The facilities enjoyed by the United States Government shall be confined to United States military tiro raft, bearing the appropriate Service makings and manned by Service air crews in uniform and on duty; (b) In accordance with the explanation given in your letter of July 1; th to me, it would be understood that American Service aircraft passing in transit through Tripolitanla in accordance with these facilities would not, ae from October 84th, 1946, carry fare-paying passengers, and that they would only carrynon-fa'fe-paying official passenger© travelling onddiijryj (c) 1 3 ^ the Beale and type of %be traffic carried by the American aircraft was found to be such as to le d to an increased cootnitraent for the British authorities either in personnel or construction, such increases would be subject to the agreement of the British authorities and to the readiness oflihe United Btates Government in principle to make an adequate financial contribu tion; (d) The United states authorities and their aircraft would normally use the radio air traffic control, metereological facilities and other aids to navigation, provided by the Royal Air Force. The United states authooitfes would not install their own equipment or organisation to supplement these services and facilities except by prior agreement with the British authorities; (e) The British authorities would be given by the United btates authonitlajs an estimate of the normal and maximum traffic which it is contem plated would pass through Tripolitania under this arrangement# The United States authorities would also give the longest possible prior notice of any exceptional scale of traffic, in order to enable the British authorities to plan administrative and maintenance arrangements on the field. (f) Customs regulations affecting Royal Air Force personnel, stores and equipment, would apply equally to American aircraft using the route# df# I should explain that while His Majesty’s Government do not intend that the use of theoe /fac ill tiesfacilities in Tripolitania 'by the United States G-overnraent should he conditional upo# reciprocal rights in territories under the control of the United States Government, they count comffjxfently upon any such request for reciprocity which might he addressed to the United States Government, should the necessity arise, receiving the most sympathetic consideration* &lt; |fplLE COPY | e^t 5 * 5/^2 /• 1'V S ECRET.

From the note of the discussion on the 21st June and from the Aide Memoire of the 29th June it does appear quite clear that negotiations for flights of American aircraft on a 'special mission basis' have been nearly concluded in Delhi, and therefore I agree that we cannot interfere in their conclusion. It does, however, seem a pity to slam the door on any future agreement for air transit rights on a common basis as desired by the Chiefs of Staf'. Could not the Government of India be asked to consider these if the Americans should require them in the future, and on the conclusion of Sjyvi ^ the Chiefs of Staff have stressed the importance of all American - M I [flights being along an R.A.F. controlled route, and in paragraph 10 (a Uamended) they say that the R.A.F. apparently are now proposing to use Palam (Delhi) and Dum Dum (Calcutta) as opposed to Agra and Kharagpur. Whilst the Government of India naturally must designate the airfields which they propose to make available, would it not be preferable for them to designate airfields in R.A.F. use in order to avoid difficulties in flying control, etc. ? the agreement which is now being negotiated for six months only ?

As from October 24th next, these aircraft should carry only non-fare-paying official passengers travelling on duty. Airfields should be on a recognised R..A*B\ route, actual airfields to be used being subject to agreement. If scale and type of traffic Americans propose is such that it would lead to increased commitment for us either in personnel or construction, such increases must be subject to British agreement and American readiness to make an adequate financial contribution.- Americans would normally utilise radio air traffic control, .meteorological facilities and aids to navigation provided.’ They would not install their own equipment or organisation to supplement these services and'facilities except by agreement. an guI a »&gt; r e s s i g1ve an estimate ofnormal and maximum traffic they envisage would use the roll te They should agree to a set period of notice for any exceptional scale of traffic, fithout this data, necessary administrative and maintenance planning ' cannot proceed* ( f ) customs regulations affecting our own personnel, stores and equipment should apply actually to Americans.

The Chiefs of Staff have been considering the further steps which should be taken in connection with the U.S. request for military air transit rights on the route from Africa via India to the Par East. The Chiefs of Staff regard it as of considerable strategic importance that this request should be granted and are informing the Foreign Office that they hope that negotiations will be continued as regards those territories for which His Majesty T s Government is in a position to accept a commitment, i. e. Tripolitania and Burma. The Chiefs of Staff note that negotiations have been in progress between the Government of India and the U.S. Government. They hope that the Government of India can be pressed to resume these negotiations and to modify their conditions so as to bring them as closely as possible in line with those v/hich we ourselves are putting forv/ard. Furthermore, they suggest that it should be pointed out to the Government of India that we do not propose to insist upon the Americans granting us reciprocal rights. The attached paper, J.

We examine below i- (a; u-eneral considerations affecting the whole route, (b) Considei’ations affecting particular sections of the route. GhnERnh CONSlfhniiTlQhh ifThCTlisIG THE WHOLE ROUTE Military (Jonslderations • ilie Chieis of Staff have expressed the view that „ — ’’hn essential featui-e of our general policy is to associate the ^mericans as closely as possible in the defence of our interests throughout the world, and particularly in the defence of the Middle East. It is therefore distinctly to our advantage that they should retain an active working interest in this route v/hich will allow them to reinforce us in the Middle Erst and elsewhere in jisia and the Mediterranean, in case of need.” Iron a military point of view, therefore, iavour of granting the Americans military air on any estatblished R.h.E. route, subject only arrangements being made to enable us to handle traffic involved, and to ensure that the U.S. not operate to our disadvantage. we are in transit rights to adequate the scale of Services do We are ox tne opinion that it is important to convince tile iuaericans as soon as possible of our wish to co-operate and not to give the impression of making difficulties. we therelore think that we should now tell the Americans the conditions on which we would be prepared to grant them the rights ior which they a.sk and to couch our reply in as favourable terms as possible. Civil .aviation iisoect 6. 1 aero however, the possibility that this request has some bearing on American civil aviation interests.' It is, therelore, important that any military air transit agreement should be kept quite separate from any civil negotiations and should contain safeguards necessary to ensure that no loophole exists ior the U.S. to further her civil aviation interests. Conditions ^t'fre light of the above, we consider that the i oil owing Scil eguards should be included in any military aviation transit agreement s- (a) The rights granted to the Americans should be coniined to military aircraft bearing the appropriate military markings, manned by military air crews in uniform and performing military duties. We also should ask the Americans to agree that as from October 24th 194b, these aircraft should carry only non-fare- paying official passengers travelling on duty. x COC (46) 97th Mtg..

The ivlinistry is in agreement with the sub- paragraphs as now drafted. Reciprocal Bights 8 ' . The foreign Office expect some difficulty in our obtaining reciprocal rights in return for granting the iuierican request. Ahile the grant of such rights would be advantageous to us in the future, we have no immediate requirements ior them. tve do not therefore consider that this should be made a condition but we should express tne hope to the iniericans that such requests iroui us, should the necessity arise, v/ould receive sympathetic consideration. ue do not believe that on the military level there would bo any uiiiicuity in obtaining reciprocal rights. In this connection, local agreement has been reached, whereby Australian and Rev/ Zealand aircraft make use of * controlled airfields in the Philippines and ex— Japanese islands en route to Japan.It war, previously planned that llauripur, A^ra (Delhi) a ^ lci ^ h ?5 ae ? ur should be ^asignated as the R#A.P. ata^ng airfields in India* It is now likely that the H.A*F* will continue uo use Palam (Delhi) and Dum Buri ('Calcutta), which are more suitable from the K#A*P* point of view. it is desirable that the Indian Government should naninate for American use the same staging airfields as those to be used by the H*A.F.CQI'ISIDi^ATlOdb Qj 1 FAivTlUJLAK SECTIQ^G Q.b 1 THE ROUTE Tripolitan!a • 9. The Auiericans have requested that they may use Mellaha aii-field for their military route. This airfield is at present operated entirely 'by them. An American request to use this airfield for their civil aviation was not granted and they are obliged to operate through Castel Benito* which is run hy the R.A.P. and designated as the civil airport at Tripoli. From the military point of view* the arguments against allowing the Americans to use Mellaha are not very strong* the only one of any importance is that it might involve us in a slightly increased security commitment. It might well be to our advantage in the long run for two airfields to be maintained in Tripolitania. If* however* the Ministry oi Civil .aviation feel strongly that the continued use of Mellaha should not be conceded to the .Americans* we could accept their military traffic at Castel Benito. India 10. On doth April the U.S. Commissioner in India put forward a request for military air transit facilities at certain airfields in India* with attendant rights set out in similar terms to those in the request to the Foreign Office. The Grovermicnt of India replied to the U.S. request for military air transit rights* giving the conditions under which they would be prepares to negotiate an agreement. / The U.S. Commissioner then asKed if the Government oi India would be prepared to allow current UoS.AoA.F. operations to continue* while the Indian reply was being examined in Washington. He also asked which were to be the designated airfields which the U.S.A.A,F. might be allowed to use in In in* and in particular* whether Karachi and Agra could be used. The Government of India replied that they would be prepared to discuss forthwith the continuance of U.So/xoAoFc operations across India on a 11 special mission basis’* * on the understanding that no U.S. ground crews would be stationed in India. The Government of India nominated the following airfields Mauripur (Karachi) Agra Barrackpur •nd/or Kharagpur (Calcutta) 11. The present position is that the negotiations for definite U.S. .ailitary air transit rights between India and the U.S. are temporarily held up. Discussions with regard to the UoSoA.^-cFo flying across India on a ^ special mission basis” are proceeding* but these need not affect the other negotiations. + Appendix II to CoO.3.(46) 194(0) / C.0 .S . ( 46) 204(0) -4-x,.,. _G jyui' Ln ii. r .. ; r ; Uonclitions . We h°ve exarjined the cunditions which the Governnent of India have proposed to the Americans for military air transit rights. These are in general in line with those we heave set out in paragraph 7. above* with the following exceptions s- (a) The Indian Government have not specifically mentioned a prohibition on carrying fare- paying passengers. (b; The Indian Government makes no mention of a possible American liability for financial assistance. (c) The Indian Government make no mention of an agreed scale of traffic. (d) We have proposed that the agreement should be terminable at six months’ notice* while the Indian draft limits the agreement to six months in the first instcoace. (e) The Government of India state that they require reciprocal rights for Indian military aircraft to use .merican udliti ry airfields as a condition for granting the U.S. request for military air transit rights. We do not propose to insist on this. Burma .lo. The u.S. Government desires to use Mingaladon airfield* near Rangoon* for their military air route. It should be noted that this airfield will take heavy bombers in emergency only; normally* it is limited to twin-engined aircraft and extensive strengthening would be required if this airfield were to be improved for regular use by heavy bombers. CONCLUSIONS 14. From the strategic point of view it is of considerable importance to us that the negotiations with the U.S. Government should, proceed and that the U.S. request should De granted. We should* therefore* wish the Foreign Office to take the matter up with the U.S. Government welcoming the proposal insofar as territories for which we can commit ourselves are concerned. These are Tripolitania and* subject to the agreement of the Burma Office in consultation with the Government of Burma* Burma. we consider that in relation to the above two territories the Foreign Office should indicate our willingness to negotiate on the basis of the conditions set out in paragraph 7 above. As regards Tripolitania from a military point of view we are not averse to allowing the Americans to continue to use their own airfield* but if the Ministry of Civil ^yiation feels strongly that this should not be ceded we can accept the U.S. military traffic at Castel Benito.ue &amp;o not intend to make the question of* obtaining reciprocal rights a condition ot granting the American request but hope that similar requests from us, should the necessity arise, would receive sympathetic American consideration.15. We cannot coLiuit the Government of India to any agreement regarding the Indian portion of the route. In view? however 9 of our common strategic interest in granting the American request 3 it would he desirable for the Government of India to proceed with their negotiations with the U.S. Government on a basis corresponding as closely as possible with the t which we have proposed above. vV T e suggest that the U.S. Government could be informed that we were very willing, to use our good offices with the Government of India to assist the progress of negotiations if the Americans so desired. We consider that the India Office should be asked i- (a) To press the Government of India to reopen negotiations with the U.S. Government for military transit rights as opposed to rights 'on a special mission basis” only. (b) To press the Government of India to modify the conditions they have proposed so as to conform as clusely as possible with those set out in paragraph 7 above. (c) To inform the Government of India that we do not propose to press for reciprocal rights. RhCOimxnMBilTIONS 16.

The Chiefs of Staff regard it as of considerable strategic importance that this request should be granted and are informing the Foreign Office that they hope that negotiations will be continued as regards those territories for which H.M. Government is in a position to accept a commitment 9 i.e. Tripoiitania and Burma. 3. The Chiefs of Staff note that negotiations have been in progress between the Government of India and the U.S. Government. They hope that the Government of India can be pressed to resume these negotiations and to modify their conditions so as to bring them as closely as possible in line with those which we ourselves are putting forward. Furthermore 3 they suggest that it should be pointed out to the Government of India that we do not propose to insist upon the Americans granting us reciprocal rights. 4. The attached paper, J.P.( 46 ) 142 Final, gives in further detail the views of the Chiefs of Staff on this subject and sets out in paragraph 7 the conditions whith they propose should be put forward to the Americans.URGENT TOP SECRET Mr, Uongt Id son, Herewith fc cooy of J.P.(46)142 FINAL for your retention. This paper will probably be taken by the Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday, 6 th August. It is highly improbable that there will be any India Office representation at this meeting. I think the paper now meets our requirements, but you will note that the directors of Rians still wish us to ask the Government of India to re-open negotiations for military transit rights on the basis of the conditions proposed. I explained to them that^ as far as we know ythe Government o f ’ India are not prepared to go any further than concluding agreement for flights M on a special mission basis” only, but the Directors were of opinion that we should ask them to negotiate for military transit rights as a link in the general chain of American military air services to the Par ^ast. ?rd August, 1946I4 We examine below (a) eeneral considerations afrecting the whole route, (b) Considei’ations affecting particular sections of the route.

V/e consider, however, that it would be preferable to state the conditions' under v/hich v/e would be prepared to negotiate a military air transit agreement especially since this course has already been adopted by the Government of India. Civil aviation Factor 5. ^ We have shown in paragraph 2 above that from the military point of view it would be in our interest to grant the American request. There is, however, the possibility that this request has some bearing on American aviation interests. It is therefore important that any military air transit agreement should be kept quite separate from any civil negotiations and should contain such safeguards necessary to ensure that no loophole exists ior America to further her civil aviation interests. S afeguards to be assured 6 . In the light of our previous paper and of the factors set out above, we consider that the following safeguards should be included in any military aviation transit agreement (a) The rights granted to the Americans should be confined to military aircraft bearing the appropriate military markings, manned by military air crews in uniform and performing military duties, carrying only non-fare-paying official passengers travelling on duty. (b) Navigational and radio facilities may only be established by the Americans where adequate facilities of our own do not exist, and the Americans should obtain permission of the Government concerned before installing any such facilities. (c) Customs regulations affecting our own personnel, stores and equipment should apply equally to the Americans. (d) In view of the uncertainty of political developments in the countries concerned, a clause should be inserted to allow the agreement to be terminated at six months notice. Sub-paragraph 6 (a) above has been drafted in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Aviation who regard it as important that sub-paragraph 6 (a) and (b) should be fully safeguarded in any military air transit agreement v/ith the Americans, so as to make quite sure that the military advantages which the Americans might gain would not farther their civil aviation interests.Comparison with Governtt-ift-nt. 0 f i n( j n ‘ fi » Conditions -4- d ie d S - requests in Delhi and.

We have no ;ther immediate requirements for reciprocal righto, and 11 mie j.. .mricans should object to granting such rights we would be prepared to drop this request. We therefore suggest that the India Office should approach the Government of India with a view to persuading them to modify their conditions regarding reciprocal rights. Consideration of U.S. Request for facilities at specified airfields ——£ 9. Tripolitania . The Americans have requested that they may use Mellaha airfield for their military route. This airfield is at present operated entirely by them. An American request to use this airfield for their civil aviation was not granted and they are obliged to operate through Gastel Benito, which is run by the R.A.P. and designated as the civil airport at Tripoli.- 5 - From the military point of view the arguments against allowing the Americans to use Mellaha are not very strong, and it might well be to our advantage in tne long^run for Mellaha to be maintained at Tripoli in addition to Caste! Benito* If, however, the Foreign Office or Ministry of Civil Aviation should strongly - oppose the continued use of Mellaha by the Americans, we would be prepared to allow their military aircraft to use Castel Benito. 10. India . In their reply to the latest U.S. request in India for facilities for aircraft operating on a ,f special mission basis”, the Government of India specified, subject to certain conditions, the following airfields:- Mauripur (Karachi) Agra Barrackpur and/or Kharagpur (Calcutta). . I ' t would be for the Government of India to say which airfields the USAAF would be allowed to use for their military air route under the wider American request. 11. Burma . ^ The U.S. Government desires to use Mingaladon airfield, near Rangoon, for their military air route. It should be noted that this airfield will take heavy bombers in emergency only; normally it is limited to twin-engined aircraft and extensive strengthening would be required if this airfield were to be improved for regular use by heavy bombers. It would be for the Government of Burma to agree to the US.AAF using Mingaladon. Conclusion 12. We conclude that:- (a) An agreement with the Americans for military air transit rights should be concluded which^would cover all the existing negotiations. The concurrence of the Governments of India and Burma to the negotiations being handled by the Foreign Office would be required. (b) The conditions set out in para. 6 above, should be safeguarded in the agreement, subject to the concurrence of the Governments of India and Burma. (c) It is essential that agreement should be reached with the Government of India on the basis for negotiation, and they should be approached with a view to persuading them to modify their condition regarding reciprocal rights.(d 1 ) Prom a military point of view we are not averse to allowing the Americans to continue to use Mel 1 aha iiirPieldj but if the Foreign Office or Ministry of Civil Aviation strongly oppose such use, we would be prepared to allow U,S. military aircraft to use Castel Benito. (e) It would be for the Government of India to say which airfields ir India the US^l.P would be allowed to use, and for the Government of Burma to agree to the USAAF using Mingaladon. Recommendations 13. We recommend that:-- (a) This paper should be sent to the Foreign Office as an expression of the 'views of the Chiefs of Staff. (b) Copies of this paper should be sent to the India Office and Burma Office, with a request that they should seek the agreement of their Government's that:- (i) the American requests for military air transit rights should be considered as a whole, and that the negotiations should be handled by the Foreign Office; (ii) the safeguards set out in paragraph 6 above are satisfactory. (c) The Government cf India should be invited to :~ (i) modify their conditions regarding reciprocal rights; (ii) nominate the airfields in India which •uhe USAAF might use. (d) The Governmen-t of Burma should be invited to agree to the USAAF using Mingaladon. (e) A copy of this paper should be sent to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

STATES OF AMERICA. Dated 12.6.46. 1L1 PS M EMPIRE The Aide Memoir© dated May 23. 1^46, Bent to the American C amissi ner, New Delhi, by the External Affairs Department of the Ooyernment of India* hus receiTed the el se and urgent attention of the various interested agencies of the government of thr* United States. As noted in paragraph 4 of the Aide Memoire in question, a fin?ncial agreement was signed in U shingt « ( n May 16, 194b), which did not fcke into consider?'ti n the civil and military air rights which the Govanmant of the United States, h ^pes to obtain from tie Government of India; and. therefore, joint consideration of financial and ovation relations, as envisaged in the * ide Memoirs of the /.merican Commissioner of April 30, 1946, is no longer in quest! n. The Government of the United St?.tea naturally wishes to press forward in the negotiation t f mutually satisfactorily arrangements with respect to avic ti n. With the imminent cheng© in the ATC program from scheduled flights to a special mission basis ito end from India, the urgency of esta blishing c aaraercialAir services between Indie and the United States becomes e'ven greater than before. In his Note No. 86 dated May 30, 1946, the American C ommissi ner pr posed th? t, due t o unfortunate delays m reaching? mutually satisfactory agreement on Air Transport, a provisional arrangement be made under which a restricted number of flights by TOA ^nd PANAM might be inaugurated. This would appear to be especially desirable since tie extension of BOAC air services bey nd' India is understood t o h^v© Hfe.de it almost impossible for non officials to travel to end from India by this service. &lt;23*V From the May %nd Aide Mem ire it is noted tb t the Government of India has set forth certain prerequisites to the neg tiati n of a civil aviati n agreement with the Govemaent of the United Sb.tes, namely: 1&gt; Agreement n weather end inf ona? ti n aids installed by the liuted states Air Forces at i irfields in India. This ouesti n, it is believed, has been settled, nd the transfer of possession of these aids has already been acc mplished or is in the process f acc mplishment. In this connection a cmaunicati n fr m the External Affairs Department to the American Connies! ner dated April 26, 1946, stated that it is the intent! n of the Government of India to maintain md operate the United States Air Force signals equipment for the purpose of improving the organizati n of the air routes in India, including mteraati n&amp;l air r utes crossing Indian territ ry; *nd it is als^ the Government of India’s policy to accord uniformity of treatment to all aircraft auth rized to fly in India in the matter ^f air r^ute facilities nd charges, and nm-disorimint tory practices in this matter are enjoined in the Convention on International Civil Aviati n to which India is a s ignat ry. The Aide Memo ire of the External Affairs Department of May 23, 1946, m p ragraph 5, confirmed the above p licies of the Government of India with reoard to this equipment.2) The return to the Government of india of the p^Bseeaion and operational c ntr 1 of t irporte at Karachi.

Aide Memo ire of the •External Affairs Departraent. and what is considered ?*, suitable basis for neg tif ti n is outlined. These prop sals e re receiving the careful nd urgent study of both the State and War Departments of the United States. The American 0 jamissioner hopes th t in the near future he will be in a position to cooraunio&amp;te in ad efunite manner with respect to t he proposals in quest! n. It would be i ppreciated if further inforaatlun c old be furnished n the following points: a) Since the airport facilities menti ned ab ve (paragraph number m l m ) cund the airports (paragraph number have been turned over to the Government t India, or will be turned over by definite dates in the raaediute future, it is hoped th t current operations of military aircraft of the United States to the extent required can continue as at present pending the a nclusion of an rgroemant on rights to be accorded military aircraft of the United St tes. b) The May 23. 1946, Aide Mem ire states that the rights in question w uld be conceded e t design-ted airfields i rom those under the o ntrol of the Air P roes of India. It would be appreciated if the mines of the arifields at which such rights would be permitted could be given. Paragraph 6 of the Aide Mem ini mentions th t Agra and Barr&amp;ckpore are to be taken over by the Air F rees of India and th t the latter, md also Kh ragpur, can continue to be used by the United States kmy Air Forces under the c nditi ns proposed. Can Karachi be used and also Agra? Are the British Air Forces to be restricted t o the use of tirports under the c ntrol of the Air F roes of India and f if this is n t the case and the BAF will control cert in fields in India, cm United States military aircraft also use such f ields or certain of them to be design ted by the Government f India? The h pe is repeated the t the question f military rights can be res Ived rapidly i.nce answers to the above quest! ns are received ana studied by i ho interested agencies t the United States Government in 'ashingtm. With agreement on this quest! n believed! be merely a matter of * short time, . nd agreement on the return of airfields and on weather and navigation aids , 1 ready refiched and rapidly being imple mented, it is h ped th? t the Government of India will consider that impediments no longer stand in the way f the conclusion of an Air Transport Agreement, as an interim measure, and pending the c Delusion of such an egreomont, it is hoped that temporary pe miss in can be granted for the operation of bi-weekly scheduled flights by TWA uid PANAM. especially in view of the imminent ana critical shortage of all types of transportation between India and the United States. JUne 12, 1946.r ^ ■ “w ii_ijj.ii ifi ^ Government of India, External Affairs Department. The Government of India have considered the aide memoire presented by the United States Commissioner, New Delhi, on the 12th June 1946. Having regard to the progress made in the transfer to the Government of India of weather and information aids installed by the United States authorities and in the return to the control of the Director-General of Civil Aviation in India of air fields loaned to the United States Army Air Forces for the duration of the war, the Government of India are prepared to discuss forthwith on the lines indicated below :- (a) the temporary continuance of tea United States Army Air Forces operations to and across India on a special mission basis, (b) pending the conclusion of a Civil Aviation Agreement, the grant of temporary permission for the operation of scheduled flights by TWA and lANAVA 2. It is noted that operations of United States military aircraft will now be on a 'special mission' basis to and across India, and it is understood that there is no longer any question of American ground crews being located at airfields in India. The Government of India have no objection to such 'special mission' operations on the following understanding. The airfields at which facilities will be available for the United states Army Air Forces are as follows :~ Mauripur Agra Barrackpore and/or Kharagpur / UShAFUnited states Array Air Pbrces aircraft may enter India at Mauripur In the west or Barrackpore or Kharagpur In the east, and Agra may be used for Intermediate landings. (Naturally any aerodrome may be used m an emergency.) The Government of India win be glad If night stops Ire confined to one particular airfield which should be designated, and If 48 hours' notice of each flight Is given to Air Headquarters (India). The same facilities as are available to the Air Fbrces In India In respect of servicing, accommodation, messing and transport will then available to the United States Array ..ir Forces aircraft at these airfields, and the standard practice applicable to Royai Air Force military aircraft as regards mstoms, health and passport examination win be applied, it Is suggested that details be finalised by a representative of the united states Army Air Forces with Air Headcparters (indla). This arrangement win be temporary and for 6 months In the first Instance, 3. Pending the conclusion of a civil Aviation Agreement, the Government of India are prepared to negotiate a provi sional agreement to cover scheduled flights by T«a and PnNaivi in accordance with the terms communicated In their letter No. d. 4437-FWR/45 dated the 3rd January 1S46 and on condition that these flights win terminate at Karachi! The provisional agreement win be negotiated for a period of three months only, subject to renewal by agreement for further periods of three months tin the conclusion of a final civil Aviation Agreement, it is suggested that the first period of three months should commence one month after the evacuation of the last airfield by the United States military authorities, i.e., on the 25th July 1946.It is requested that a representative! of the United States Mission will place himself in touch with the Posts and Air Department for discussion of details under this head, 4. In regard to a permanent Civil Aviation Agreement the Government of India have already- stated a basis for negotiations in their letter of the ord January mentioned above. The United States Mission in reply proposed an agreement on the lines of the Bermuda Agreement between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, The Government of India regret that they do not regard the Bermuda Agreement ^s a suitable basis for discussion and would prefer that resumed negotiations should proceed on the basis of their letter of the 3rd January.

(46) 142 (S’) (Preliminary Draft ) 23RD JULY, 1946 CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE JOINT PLANNING STAFF U.3. REQUEST FOR MILITARY ^IR TRANSIT RIGHTS Draft Report by the Joint Planninp; Staff In anticipation of instructions, we Lave examined a letter* from the Foreign Office, giving the U.S. Government s replies to a series of questions which were_asked to elucidate the American request for military air transit rights. 'Je have taken into account an hide Memoire - ^ on this subjec prepared by the Government of India, and haye consulted the India Office and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The United States Request 2. The American request was considered in our previous paper. Our conclusions were as follows:*-* it ^ ... there are some advantages to be gained by granting to the Americans the rights for which they ask, and there do not appear to do ^ny strategic disadvantages. The one cardinal point to be gained in negotiations with the Americans is that they should make use of R.A.i'. airfields and not establish and equip fields of their own. How far this will be practicable depends on further investigation and, therefore, before wve agree to the American request, there are .certain other questions to which v/e shall require to know the answers”. The questions which were put before the and their replies are given at Annex I. replies are evasive and unsatisfactory. United States Gove*mment In general, the3* The details of the U•3* request are by no means clear; it would appear that the airfields which they wish to use are as follows:- Tripoli Me11aha Airfield India • Karachi, Agra and Dumdum The Americans also wish to exercise rights at Barrackpore, until A.T.C. operations can be moved to Dumdum, and at Kharagpur airfield for aircraft too large to be accommodated at Dumdum. NOTE: Dumdum, Barrackpore and Kharagpur are all in the vicinity of Calcutta, Burma Mingaladon (near Rangoon) At Annex II we consider in detail each airfield at which the Americans have asked for military air transit rights. Other Negotiations 4. In addition to this request through diplomatic channels in London which 'we have been asked to consider, the Americans have made the following approaches;- (a) To the Government of India direct in New Delhi. The U.S. Commissioner in India has put forward a parallel request for military air transit facilities at the airfields in India shown in.paragraph 3, with attendant rights set out in the same words as in the request to the Foreign Office, The Americans linked this request in India to negotiations which were proceeding in Washington regarding the termination of Lease-Lend and to the satisfactory conclusion of a Civil _.viation Agreement with India, and stated that in their view these negotiations were rglated. The Government of India have already replied^ to the U.S, request for military air transit rights, giving the conditions under which they would be prepared to negotiate an agreement. The progress of the negotiations in India was not known, when our previous paper was written on this subject. (b) Various requests from the American Minister in Egypt and other American authorities in the Middle East to allow American civil airlines to use Mallaha airfield in Tripoli. This request was referred to London and has been’refused. Future Action 3 . We are of the. opinion that all the American requests for military air transit rights should be considered as a whole, and that the Americans should receive the same answer in London as in Delhi. The concurrence of the Governments of India and Burma to the negotiations being handled by the Foreign Office v/ould be required. / Appendix II to C.0.S#(46) 194 ( 0) -2-It might be argued that, since the American replies to the questions put to them are unsatisfactory, we should return with a further set of questions*. We consider, however, that it would be preferable to state the conditions under which we would be prepared to negotiate a military air transit agreement, especially since this course has already been adopted by the Government of India. Before considering these conditions, there are two factors v/hich require special consideration, civil aviation and reciprocal rights. Civil Aviation 6 . The India Office have drav/n attention to the fact that the discussions in Delhi cover a large field of unrelated subjects mainly concerned with civil aviation facilities. They consider that the questions of civil and military aviation facilities should be kept quite separate. We are in full agreement v/ith this view.. The Ministry of Civil iiviation also welcome this suggestion but since any military air transit agreement may well have implications on the civil aviation aspect, the agreement must contain safeguards which v/ill satisfy the Ministry , of Civil Aviation. Reciprocal Rights 7. We note that the Foreign Office are somewhat apprehensive about our seeking reciprocal rights in return for granting the American request. While the grant of reciprocal rights would be advantageous to us, we do not consider that it should be made an over-riding condition for granting the U.S. request. It would *&gt;e sufficient if the Americans^were to agree to receive sympathetically any request we might make for similar facilities, v/hich should also apply to aircraft of all the Dominions. We do- not believe that on the military level there would be any difficulty in obtaining reciprocal rights. Furthermore, local agreement has been reached whereby Australian and New Zealand aircraft make use of U.S. controlled airfields in the Philippines and ex-Japanese islands en route to Japan. Conditions under which U.S. request should be granted 8 . In the light of our previous paper and of the factors set out above, we consider that the following conditions should be safeguarded in any military aviation transit agreement:- (a) The Americans should make use of British or Indian controlled airfields, subject to there being no overcrov/ding. (b) The /mericans should agree to consider sympathetically any request which we might make for similar facilities, which should also apply to aircraft of all the Dominions.- 4 - (c) The rights granted to the Americans should be confined to military aircraft bearing the appropriate military markings, manned by military air-crews in uniform and performing military duties, carrying only non-fare-paying official passengers travelling on duty, . (d) Navigational and radio facilities may only be established by the Americans v/here our own facilities do not exist, and the Americans should obtain permission of the Government concerned before installing any such facilities* (e) Customs regulations affecting our own personnel, stores and equipment should apply equally to the Americans, (f) The period of the agreement should be limited to six months, in view of the uncertainty of political developments in the countries concerned# 9, ^ We have examined the Aide Memoire + from the Government of India in reply to the U#3# request in India# All the points given in para, 8 above are covered by this Aide Memoire# Regarding reciprocal rights, the Government of India have stated that they require reciprocal rights for Indian military aircraft to use American military airfields as a condition for granting the U#3. request, which goes further than our requirements. Sub-para* ^(c) above has been drafted in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and is fuller than the Government of India’s paragraph on this point. The Ministry of Civil /-aviation regard it as important that sub-para., ${c) and (d) should be fully safeguarded in any military air transit agreement with the Americans, so as to make quite sure that the military advantages which the Americans might gain v/ould not further their civil aviation interests. Special Considerations 10, Me11aha Airfield ; This is at present operated entirely by the~~Americans. An American request to use Mellaha airfield for their civil aviation was not granted and they are obliged to operate through Castel Benito, which is run by the R.A.P. and designated as the civil airport for Tripoli. We are of'the opinion that to grant the Americans the right to . use Mallaha for their military route would provide them . with an excuse to reopen the v/hole questioh of designated airfields, which would be undesirable both to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and to the R.A.F.. We therefore consider that permission for the Americans to use Mellaha for their military services be refused and that they should instead be permitted to use Castel Benito# In view of possible overcrowding at this latter airfield it would be necessary to limit the + Appendix II to C.0#3. (46) 194 (0)number of U#S. military aircraft. We sujgest that if a top limit of 5 aircraft per day, which should bo quite possible on this airfield, was suggested to the Americans we would bo able to gauge the scale of traffic by their • reaction to this limitation. As the continued use of Mollaha is contrary to our policy (see paragraph 2 above) we further suggest that the Foreign Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, should approach the Americans to inform them that we wish to return Mcllaha airfield to local agricultural or industrial purposes now. 1 1• airfields in India and Burma t If the American requests for military air transit rights are to be considered as a whole, the concurrence of the Governments of India and Burma to the conditions given in para. 8 above will be required. Provided these conditions are agreed to, it would be for the Government of India to say which airfields the Americans would be allowed to use in India and for the Government of Burma to agree to the U.S.A. A.F. using Mingaladoru Conclusion 12. We conclude that:- (a) iUi agreement with the Americans for military aircraft transit rights should be concluded which would cover all the existing negotiations. The concurrence of the Governments of India and Burma to the negotiations being handled by the Foreign Office v/ould be required. (b) The conditions set out in paragraph 8 above should be safeguarded in the agreement.

(t&gt;) Is it entirely clear that full control is to be exercised in the airfields by the nation exercising sovreignity, mandate or trusteeship? (c) Would the United States be prepared to grant their reciprocal rights on certain of their own military routes in China and across the Pacific? (d) Do the United States intend to allow any paying passengers in their military aircraft? (e) What is the likely scale of their traffic to Sl be flown ever the route? AMERICAN AftELIES (a) We are told that in addition to the requirements in Burma which have previously been made known to your Government, similar rights are desired at the Mellaha airfield in Tripoli. (b) Yes. (c) The State Department point out that this question has not been considered; that a specific request of this nature would have to be referred to the appropriate military authoritie (d) Under United States law the military aircraft are permitted to carry until 24 th October, 1946, fare paying passengers, but only along routes where the commercial service is inadequate. (e) The State Department say that it is impossible to give an answer to this question, but^ presumably this is dependent upon the military requirements of the occupation forces.1 AIRFIELD PRESENT USER AIRFIELD GAPj : J3ILITIES REMARKS Mellaha U* S * A# F* Heavy Bombers 3 Runways 6 miles E® of Tripoli Karachi India (Director General Civil liviation) Very Heavy Bombers 1 Runway Civil airport for Karachi.

Having regard to the progress made in the transfer to the Government of India of weather and information aids Installed by the United States authorities and in the return to the control of the Director-General of Civil Aviation in India of air fields loaned to the United States Army Air Horces for the duration of the war, the Government of India are prepared to discuss forthwith on the lines indicated below :- h ( a ) th e temporary continuance of fltoe United States |j Army Air Forces operations to and across India V on a special mission basis, (b) pending the conclusion of a Civil Aviation Agreement, the grant of temporary permission for the operation of scheduled flights by TWii and thttbiVi , 2, It is noted that operations of United States military aircraft win now be on a M special mission' basis to and across India, and it is understood that there is no longer any question of American ground crews being located at airfields in India. The Government of India have no objection to such 'special mission' operations on the following understanding. The airfields at which facilities will be available for the United States Army Air Forces are as follows Mauripur Agra Barrackpore and/or Kharagpur / USAAF-J - VMtea states Army Air Jbrces aircraft may enter India at Mauripur in the west or Barrackpore or Kharagpur In the east, and Agra may be used for Intermediate landings.

In regard to a permanent Civil Aviation Agreement the Government of India have already stated a basis for negotiations in their letter of the 3rd January mentioned above. The United states Mission in reply proposed an agreement on the lines of the Bermuda Agreement between the United states of America and the United Kingdom. The Government of India regret that they do not regard the Bermuda Agreement as a suitable basis for discussion and would prefer that resumed negotiations should proceed on the basis of their letter of the 3rd January.

Note was teikan of tne fact that future operations of the U.S.A.A.F. through India would be on a 'special mission' basis and that there will be no regular U.3.A # A•F. service. It was agreed that in these circumstance? American ground crews would not be necessary ana the U.S. representatives statod that it was not intended to have any. The usual facilities for messing, accommodation and servicing will b« available at all airfields under the control of the Air Forces in India, and stocks of spares can also be hela at these airfields for the U.S.A.A.F. (It was made clear that military airfields in India are available to all aircraft, whether of the HaF or RIAF, l^n the Indian Establishment). It w*?s pointed out that ground crews at thvsa airfields wixl not be able to service U.S.A.A.F. air craft of types which the Air Forces in India flo not posses. It was, however, understood that this wauld present no difficulty because American air crews generally do their own servicing. No special arrangement in respect of customs, health and pass port examination will be necessary as the standard practice applicable to military aircraft will oe followed. The United States authorities undertcod as a general rule to give Air Headquarters (India) 48 hours* notice of eacn flight, and it was agreed that night stops should as far as possible always be made at the same airfield. 2.

I agree with Mr* Ledwidge that it may be that the American approach in Delhi is a deliberate piece of tactics designed to bring pressure to bear on H.M.G. in respect of the parallel approach made in London and reinforced in Paris; but it is also possible that, owing to the extreme secrecy with which the earlier representations were surrounded, thet the request for facilities now made in respect of military air transit rights may have been made in ignorance of the earlier approaches for the operational use of airfields in India. The fact that the Americans ha\fc disclosed to us in London that they have instructed their Commissioner in Delhi to open the matter there certainly seems to support the former hypothesis* I attach a revised draft for you to send to Mr. Butler.DRAFT LETTER EXT. if2 84/46 Neville Butler, Esq., C.M.G., C#V.Oo, Foreign Office, S.W.l. / Gt ftUW Copy for air Lv Hollis, Cabinet Office, Sir (J.Laithwaite, TOP SECRET PERSONAL In my letter of the 15th June about facilities for United States military aircraft at airfields in India I told you that we had telegraphed ?he Viceroy about the negotiations at New Delhi which were mentioned hy G-allman in his conversation with Mason on the 11th June. I sent you a copy of our telegram of 15th June and now enclose a copy of the Viceroy*s reply and of the papers mentioned in it. Froa these you will see that the discussions in New Delhi cover a large field of what should be entirely unrelated questions mainly concerned with civil aviation facilities. You will notice, however, that the exchange of notes also includes a request by the Americans for limited facilities /torfor U.S. military aircraft for the specific purpose of transit through India ”to return U«S«personnel i • from or through the Par Sast or the Near and Middle East, and to serve U.S#occupation forces in the Par East”. This request, though prima facie distinguishable from the original suggestion in respect of operational bases, seems clearly to be, at least potentially, connected with it^ Might it be worth while, when next you are discussing the matter with the .American Embassy, to point out that the questions of civil and military aviation facilities, both of which are included in the Delhi negotiations, should in our view be kept quite separate? Otherwise, confusion will result and lines will become crossed# At the same time it would be helpful to elicit from the Americans, if possible, what connection there is^between the approaches made simultaneouoly in London and in Delhi in regard to facilities for military aircraft at Indian airfields# ' ll - —I am sending a copy of this with its ( k ^ eno ^° 3ures to the Cabinet Office ffv/p ■If-* ^ with reference to JP(46)115 (Pinal) which I see has now been approved by the Chiefs of Staff.MB•'V* ISH) Sir D.

I think that what has happened is not that the Americans have made a wholly unconnected approach in Delhi, but that they ■Zl followed a technique which they rather favour in dealing with the Governments of the British Commonwealth - that of making parallel approaches to H.M.G. and the Dominion Government corwernedjwithout informing either of the line taken with the o her, and then revealing the more favourable answer to both parties and suggesting it as a basis for further negotiation. .'.light it not therefore be as well to make it clear that we ave fathomed this American technique by leaving out the bracketed please in paragraph 3.and amplifying paragraph 4 so as ° s ress the point which it is most in our interest to establish - 3 #e *. a °dly civil air questions should be discussed in New Delhi, and that the matter of military rights should be reserved for negotiation between the U.S. Government and H.M.G., who can en consult the Government of India as appropriate, and concert policy with them. 9 ^ It is rather a portent that the Americans have begun to adopt with the Government of India methods previously reserved for the Dominions, They are sure to do so more frequently when a popular government is formed in India.TOP SECRKT Ext. 4284A6 General Mayne; U.S.S,. P so The Viceroy has now replied to our telegram of the 15th June saying that all the airfields in India hitherto occupied by the American military authorities have been handed back to the Government of India but that ^negotiations are proceeding with the U. S. Commissioner in Delhi/particulars of we had received but had transferred to T^he C. &amp; 0. Department v since they appeared to relate mainly to civil aviation matters) It now appears that the American request^made in an aide memo ire of 30th April, was for rights for military aircraft at Karachi, Agra, Dumdum and Barrackpore airports n for as long as is necessary to return U. S. personnel from or through the Par East or the Near and Middle East, and to serve U.S. ^ I 1 forces in the Par East.

We have taken into account comments from the India Office and have incorporated the views of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, U«S» Request 2. The American Government have approached His Majesty f s Government expr ssing a desire to obtain, for strategic reasons, certain military air transit rights along the Africa - Far East route, for the period during which the U.S. has occupational forces in Germany and Japan. The proposed route is from Liberia to Indo-China through Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Burma and Siam. The rights requested^ include the right for military aircraft to fly ovir and land, with the following attendant rights:~ (a) To instal, maintain and operate such aids as may be required* (b) To operate seaplane tenders in the vicinity of specified seaplane landing areas. (c) To -employ and station personnel and maintain the necessary stores free of imposts. (d) To exempt Americsn personnel and all types of equipment in transit from imposts and inspections. (e) To contract locally for services and supplies. +C. 0. S. f 46V 88 th Meeting, Item 2. /C. 0. S. (46) 152 (0) and C. 0. S. (46) 164 (0). /Appendix ’B' to Annex II C.O.S. (46) 152 (0) -* 1 -; 4. An essential feature of our general policy is t© associate {% the Americans as closely as possible in the defence of our - interests throughout the world, and particularly in the defence ^ r of the Middle East* It is therefore distinctly to our advantage that they should retain an active working interest in this route which will allow them to reinforce us in the Middle East, and elsewhere in Asia and the Mediterranean, in case of need. Other advantages are:-The War Department is willing to rurnowe all uniformed personnel at an early date rovided their requirements can be met by the use of civilian personnel. o. If thu facilities they request are granted they would o -tain the foilov;ing ad vant agos: - (a) An alternative to the Pacific route consisting of relatively short stages by which it would be possible to fly short and medium range aircraft from U. S. A. and Germany to the Par East and elsevh re in Asia. (b) The presence of American personnel and equipment in countries along the route would strengthen their position both commercially and politically. In this connexion account must bo taken of the possibility that this request has some bearing on the furtherance of American civil aviation interests.

In particular this might assist our present negotiations with Egypt. (c) If we back the American r-.quest with foreign countries we might reasonably expect them to support any request of this sort which we might wis to make to foreign governments in the future. (d) Cerbain additional facilities would be available eitner ior our use or* at any rate, to augment our own system. 5« On the other hand:- (a) In countries where we are responsible for internal oecurity wo could not accept any additional coinmitmunt for safeguarding American personnel ana property and there can bo no question of them providing guards thornselvos. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Americans to use airfields which are garrisoned by us. This may result in difficulties, overcrowding and aernand for additional facilities in certain ox the airfields.(b) Laoour aifficulties arise where the Americans employ local man-power. ^at present put forward the American request Liia±it result in the U.

How far this will be practicable depends on further investigation and therefore before we agree to the American request, there are certain’ opher questions' to which wo shall requike to hnow the a „ 0 w e «. - 3 -9. Wo think these questions shealcl be:- (a) V/hich airfields in each country do the ijnorioans v^ish to use? (b) Is it entirely clear that full control is to be exercised in the airfields by the nation. (c) Would the United States be prepared to grant us reciprocal rights on certain of their own military ro i ~ n China and across the Pacific? (d) Do the United States intend to carry any fare paying passengers in their military aircraft? (e) '.'That is the likely scale- of their traffic to be flow over the route? On receipt of the answers to Ghese questions it would be possible to frame the conditions under which the American request could be granted. 10.

The Aide Manoire expressed the view of the U.S.Govt. that the two sets of negotiations should bo linked, 2. It will be convenient to recall that the following negotiations have been or are now in train between the Govt. of India and the Govt, of the United States either in India or in Washington, (a) the financial negotiations in Washington attendant on the liquidation of Mutual Aid. (b) the disposal and operation of American owned air navigation a nd weather infomation aids established by the Govt, of the United States on Indian airfields during the war, (c) the return to the Govt, of India of airfields placed at the disposal of the U.S.A.A.F. for the duration of the war, (d) temporary facilities for military aircraft of the United States Air Transport Command to operate in, across \ away from Indian territory, (e) the conclusion of a Civil Aviation Agreement between the Govt, .of India and the Govt, of the United Sts, to s # 3.

Tho Govt, of India worn rncontly informod by thoir negotiators in Washington that tho Govt, of tho United States no longer sought to connect tho financial negotiations in Washington with tho prior or concurrent conclusion of a Civil Aviation Agronmont, or with other intangibles, In fact agroemont on those financial negotiations has already boon roachod and made public. £, Concerning tho disposal and operation of weather information and navigation aids installed by tho U.S.A.A.F. on airfields in India the Govt, of India have already communicated thoir views on those matters in thoir letter Mo. D 1 2124-P_W46, datod tho 26th April 1946. In tho view of tho Govt, of India tho toms and conditions for tho disposal of this surplus property have already boon settled in tho bulk sale agreement, and thoir ownership and the financial liabili ty attaching theretoboon settled in tho Washington negotiations referred to above, which cover all American owned surplus property in India. It may bo added, with reference to tho Mission's letter No.69 dated tho 9th May 1946, that tho Govt, of India letter of tho 26th April refer rod to immediately above convoyed in tho second paragraph a definite statement of intention in regard to this equipment, which may be accepted as such. 6. Concerning the return to the Govt, of India of tho possession and operational control of Karachi Air Port, the Govt, of India f s views have been communicated to the Mission in their letter No.F. 10(5)-'PWIV / 46, datod the 22nd April 1946, There are certain other airfields in the occupation or partial occupation of tho U.S.A.A.F. in India of which tho Govt, of India are anxious to regain inmodiato unconditional possession and operational control. These are as follows:- Bum Pum^jj^rpcrt -Tho Govt, of India regret that they /cannot—cannot accommodato tho U.3.A.A.F. at this civil airport and roquost that all accommodation still in possossion of tho U.S.A.A.F. bo handed over forthwith to roprosontativoe of tho Govt^ of India. AfiHa ~ Tho Govt, of India dosiro to tako ovnr full control and occupation of this airfield immediately for the accommodation of Air Forces in India, and it is therefore requested that tho necessary orders to this effect may bo issued by the United States Govt. Iknraskppre “ This airfield is intended for tho occupation of tho Air Forces in India, and it is desired to take over full operational and administrative control as early as possible. This airfield may, however, continue to be used for U.S.A.A.F. operations subject to tho conditions in para graph 7 below. .All personnel now stationed at Dum Dun idivil ^airport should be transferred to Barrackporo. Misirairfield may also, subject to the conditions In SfnnAf k low ’ ^ r 3Uch U*S.A.A.F. aircraft as cannot be accommodated at Barrackporo. 7. Tho Govt, of Indie aro willing to nogotiato with tho Govt, of tho Unitod States for certain rights to bo accordod to militar U iror a ft of the Govt, of tho U.3.A. on certain Indian airfields for a limited period( say six months in tho first instance), as soon as tho possession and control of tho afore mentioned Indian airfields have boon transferred to tho Govt, of India. Tho Govt, of India cont&lt;*nplato tho following as a suitable basis for negotiations in this matter. (1) The right of military air transit of agreed froquoncy and of technical atop would bo granted to tho U.S.A.T.C. at airfields designated by tho Govt, of India, but including tho right to land in rmorgoncy a t any airfield. The Govt.of India, would reserve the rignt to withdraw this permission if in their opinion special circumstances rendered it necessary.Tho grpnt of thoso rights to tho U.S.A.T.C. would bo oonditional on tho grant of rociprocal rights for military aircraft on tho Indian ostablishn&lt;-nt to oporato through Apiorican-controllod torritorios and to uao American military airfields in those torritorios. No to 1, Those rights would apply only to military aircraft, bearing tho appropriate military markings, manned iDy military aircrews in uniform and performing military duties, frl pto.2. It is the intention of the Govt, of India that tho airfields to bo designated en this behalf should bo from among the se under the control of tho Air Forces in India. (2)(a). Tho U.S.A.T.C. would utilise the radio, air traffic control and meteorological services and aids to navigation, provided by tho Govt, of India. They would not install their own equipment or organisation to supplement those services and facilities, except with the consent of the Govt, of India. (2)(b). Tho right to operate seaplanes and seaplane tenders at seaplane landing areas designated by the Govt.of India would be accorded in conformity with the conditions set out under sub-paragraph (l) above. (2)(c). The right to station U.S.military personnel at tho designated airfields and seaplane landing areas would bo given, subject to agreement with tho Govt, of India as to the strength of personnel to be accommodated and subject to accommodation being available. The right to store technical stores and equipment necessary for the operations concerned at tho designated airfields and seaplane landing areas would be given subject to accommodation being available. The right to import, free of customs duties essential technical stores and equipment for the operations of tho /A.T.C.A«T,C* sorvico would bo grantod. This right would bo . cU. C#**- ^ subject to the product!on^of a cortificato of a competent U*S«authority that the goods are imported for the operations aforesaid. This right does not include the right to import free of duty, food, liquors etc. for the use of the U.S* personnel stationed in India or in transit across India. (2) (d). Military personnel, aircraft stores and equip ment in transit would bo exempted from customs duties subject to the right of supervision of the customs authori ties.

All aircraft, their personnel and contents would be subject to examination for quarantine purposes, (2)(e). Tho right to contract with persons, companies or Government agencies for services and supplies for tho purpose of A.T.O. operations would be granted. 8. In the matter of negotiating a Civil Aviation Agreement between tho two Governments, the views of the Govt.of India wore communicated in their letter N0.D.4437-PWR/45, dated tho 3rd Jany. 1946, in reply to which the Mission's further corranuniCation No,52 dated the 8th April 1946, has boon received.

In Washington a delegation of the Government of India i s • negotiating with officials of the Government of the United States wnat it is hoped will become a mutually satisfactory liquidation of the financial relations between the two countries. _ In IIew Delhi negotiations have been in progress between officials of the Government of India and the American Commissioner of several questions relating to aviation, the most important of Which is &amp;n ^-fraqs port agreeme nt.

In the view of the Government of the United States the two sets of negotiations are related. In the negotiations now in progress in Washington, the representatives of the United States Government have proposed to J Indian delegation that, in order to assure the enjoyment of mutually profitable relations with India in the post-war period, and with an understanding of the political factors involved, ' (1) lend lease and reciprocal aid accounts should be mutually cancelled, and (2) United States surpluses in India should be sold, to the Government of India in return for real property to house the American diplomatic and consular offices and staffs ln Indi&amp; ’ a rupee cultur al relat ions fund, and certain intangibles. *j? p hin» t» .t.v .hi hii a The ENOLuy tic.

It must be stresseo that a liberal lend lease settlement could only be justifies to the United States Congress, in terms of intangible benefits and particularly air rights and the American Commissioner has been instructed to bring the close relationship between the two sets of negotiations to the attention of the Government of India with the minimum delay in order to expedite the conclusion in Washington of a lend lease settlement. It is believed that the United States Armed Forces will declare surplus to their needs all airfields in India a s rapidly as operational requirements permit. The Government of the United States proposes to ba se its proposal for the lend lease settlement upon the prior or con current conclusion of an air transport agreement together with assurances of most favored nation treatment for United States civil aircraft at airfields which have or may be designated by the Government of India as international civil airports, including the fields in which the United States has made investments; together with an aviation facilities service agreement and a n agreement with respect to Miliary rights for United States aircraft. i An earller Note from the American Commissioner to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department outlined in general the rights for military aircraft which are desired after the inactivation of the India-Burma Theater. More recent instructions indicate that rights for such aircraft are desired at the Karachi, Agra and Dum Dum awirarP+y airports with the right to exercise such rights at Barrackpore until ATC operations can be moved to Dum Dum and at the KharaQjur airfield for such aircraft a s are too large to be accommodated at Dum Dum. The American Commissioner ha s been instructed to seek the conclusion of an agreement with the Government of India conferring certain rights for a s long a s is necessary to return United.....tJnited States personnel from or through the Far East or the dear and Middle East and to serve United States occupation forces in the Faf East. The rights the American Commissioner has been instructed to request are as follows: 1) Right of military air transit and technical stop which means the right to operate military aircraft into, over and away from India, to land at the air ports specified to refuel, effect repairs or due to unfavourable weather, without restriction except as mutually agreed between the United States and India. 2) The following attendant rights: a*) to install, maintain and operate such aids to navigation, communications and weather reporting facilities as may be required subject to mutual agreement. « b) to operate where necessary seaplane tenders in the territorial waters of specified seaplane landing areas, such facilities to include the use of anchorage facilities in such waters by the vessels in question, without restriction except as mutually agreed. e; to irrport, station, store in. or remove from designated airfields the minimum personnel, supplies, and material necessary for transit operations, free ^ ol customs, duties, taxes, and imposes of any kind. the exemption of United States official personnel, aircraft, supplies and equipment in transit from customs, duties, taxes and imposts, and inspections otner than those required for quarantine or similar purposes. * ©) to contract with persons, companies, or government agencies for services and supplies locally required. The United States would withdraw all uniformed personnel as quickly as possible, providing necessary servicing arrange ments with either United States or Indian personnel can be made. Since, in the view of the United States Government, the two sets of negotiations are closely interrelated, it would appear that either both negotiations should be oarried on in Washington or, alternatively, the air negotiations be completed in New Delhi as rapidly a s possible in order that, on the basis of such concluded arrangements, the financial negotiations now in progres in Washington can also be concluded. Shouldi. m -:4j- Should the Government of India prefer to have the two sets of negotiations carried on simultaneously in Washington, the suggestion is made that possibly the Government of India may wish to send to Washington one of its officials thoroughly conversant with the air plans of India who might either negotiate the agreements m question or, should the Government of India wish to transfer such negotiations to the Indian Agency Genera,! in Washington, such an official could serve as an expert adviser. The Department of State has inquired whether the Director General 0 f Civil Aviation in India, Sir Frederick Tymms, is attending the PICAO meeting in Montreal on “ ay 21 » 1946 » arid whether the Government of India might wish to consider having him visit Washington beforehand to participate in air negotiations should they be transferred there.

It certainly seems somewhat surprising, if true, that there should have been some direct discussion . between the United States authorities and the authorities in India on this subject, and I wonder if you have any information on this point. You may remember that when the United States approached us on the subject of the Indian airfields at the end of last February through our Embassy in Washington and also through Mr.James Dunn, they indicated that if we were unable to support their requests with the Government of India they would be prepared to approach the Government of India direct: I do not know whether (in the absence of any reply to the February approach) they have decided to implement that warning or whether they feel that, as they would be approaching other governments direct which were situated along the North Africa-India-Burma route they were justified in making such a direct approach to D e lhi. Have you also any information which would suggest that the American Consul at Rangoon has in fact said anything to the Government of Burma about Mingaladon?

It will be recalled that the letter of the 16th May desired that the rights as :od for in general should be exorcised, with respect to Burma, at the airfield at fingaladon, the airfield in Burma regarding which (along wiuh throe airfields in India) we have had earlier representations from tashington* 3* Mr* Gallman also gave m© to understand that the united States consul at Rangoon had boon informed that the embassy in London wore about to put forward request* of the nature outlined in Mr* Gallman’s letter of the 16th May which would cover, ao far as Buraia was concerned, llinguladon, with the understanding that the Consul could inform the Governient of Burma accordingly if he thought fit. The Consul at Rangoon, hr* Oallm&amp;n said, would havo received this notification from /ushiagton on or about May Uth. I must have raised my eyebrows at this, since Mr* Galim&amp;n- explained with some embarrassment that the original communication ' from Washington which was eventually developed into Mr. Gallman’s letter of May 16th had in fact been received in the embassy at tho beginning of May, and that it had boon held up in the aabnsay by juniors on points of procedure without Mr* Gallman hi is elf knowing of it until some days later. 4« The short telegram which Mr* Gallman showed me, as mentioned / above, also gave the embassy to understand that in respect of the airfields in Inala to be covered by the proposals in his letter of the loth May, there had been some direct contact between the United States Government and th» authorities of the Government of India already 5 Indeed the telegram spoke of tho * Indian authorities having made some counter proposals which the United states authorities were now considering; and it mis because of this fact that they were anxious to get on as regards tho airfield in urma. Mr. Gallman was unable to elucidate this fur&amp;her. I expressed some surprise on hearing of this and said that it was mows to me that there had boon any ouch direct contact or that counter that the United States, when making their communication about th« Indian airfields through r« Balfour and Mr. James 1 at the ei of last February, had intimated that if we were not ouruclves prepared to moves the Government of India in the sense then sug gested, the united States Ooeernnent would be quite prepareu to approach India direct). 3 .

Dear Paul, After seeing you last Friday, I asked the State Department for clarification of the points you raised in connexion with our desire for certain military air transit rights along the Africa-lndia route. I have now received the Department^ reply. The Department says that the route over which these rights are desired extends from Liberia through Morocco, Algeria, Tripoli, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, B urma. Siam, to Indo-China. Negotiations with several of tEe Govern ments involved have been undertaken. While we do not anticipate requesting your active assistance it is, never theless, hoped that your Government will, in the event its advice is sought, indicate lack of opposition. The Government of the United States, the Department adds, is not opposed to making public the agreements reached, as but we would, of course, defer in this to the wishes of the Governments concerned. these agreements are related to the duties of occupation I hope this clears up the points you had in mind Sincerely, (Signed) WALDIE GALLMAN.

It is not, as you will notice, very precise as to the specific airfields involved, but I think we ought to take it that Mr. Byrnes still had in mind the four airfields regarding which he approached us at the end of last February (as briefly recorded in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Foreign secretary’s paper for the Defence Committee of April 13th (D. 0. (46) 58)) , particulars of which are given in the correspondence referred to by Monteath. 3* It is worth noting that Mr. Byrnes’s approach in Paris is not quite on all-fours with that which he made at the end of last February in which, as you will recall, (the correspondence was sent to Jacob at the time), he asked for our acquiescence in an American share in controlling the mintenance of the airfields in question. vhat the later approach seems to contemplate is that the Government of India should maintain the airfields and that the Ameri cans should have landing rights in them, which would perhaps somewhat simplify the issues at stake. 4. 7«/ Major General sir L.C.

London, May 16, 1946. .A Dear Nevile, The Embassy has been requested to discuss with the Foreign Office the desire of the United States Government to obtain^certain military air transit rights along the North Africa—India route, which are considered by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff to be highly desirable because of strategic considerations. The State Department desires that negotiations be undertaken with the British Government to secure these rights for the period during which the United States has occupation forces in Germany and Japan. It is the belief of the United States Govern ment that these rights are essential to the fulfilment of obligations assumed by the United States as a result of its participation in the war and in order to secure the victory by providing essential communication facilities between occupation forces. The rights desired are defined by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff as follows; 1. The right of military air transit and technical stop is the long-term right to operate military aircraft into, over and away from a designated territory, and to land at one or more specific airfields or seaplane landing areas therein to refuel, effect repairs, or avoid unfavorable weather conditions, without restriction except as mutually agreed between the United States and the nation exercising sovereignty, mandate or trusteeship. Nevile M. Butler Esq., C.M.G. ,C. V.O. , Assistant Under-Secretary of State, The Foreign Office, London, S.7.1.2. In the exercise of the above right, the United States to have the following attendant rights: (A) To install, maintain and operate such aids to navigation, communications, and weather reporting facilities as may be required, subject to mutual agreement. (B) To operate seaplane tenders, as required in the exercise of the rights accorded, in territorial waters in the vicinity of specified seaplane landing areas, suc|i operations to include use of anchorage facilities in those waters by such vessels, without restriction except as mutually agreed. (C) To import, station, store in, or remove from a designated airfield the mini mum personnel, supplies, and material necessary for transit operations, free of customs, duties, taxes, and imposts of any kind. (D) Exemption of United States official personnel, aircraft, supplies and equipment in transit, from customs, duties, taxes, imposts, and inspections other than those required for quarantine or similar purposes. (E) To contract with persons, companies, or Government agencies for services and supplies locally required. With respect to Burma, it is desired ladon airport. The United States War Department is willing to remove all uniformed personnel at an early date pro vided it is assured of arrangements for adequate maintenance and operation of airports and facilities,and provided adequate servicing can be obtained through United States or local civilian personnel. The Embassy will appreciate the comments of the Foreign Office on the above proposals. Sincerely, (Signed) WALDI G-ALLMAN.Possible questions arising from Mr. Gallman*s letter of 16th May. (a) ,/hat countries, if any, are involved besides India and Burma? The North Africa-lndia route might in volve (taken at random) Casablanca, Gibraltar, Castel Benito, Benghazi, Cairo, Transjordan and the Persian Gulf. If so, the proposals would deal not only with our own terri tory, but with future trusteeship territory (Cyrenaica) and foreign countries, as regards foreign countries, it is not clear whether we are asked to support a united States approach to the Governments concerned. Alternatively, the present letter may merely constitute an approach to us about our own territories and an intimation that the United States is going to approach other Governments, e.g. Egypt, direct. (b) What are to be the designated airfields in each country? (c) Are the designated airfields to be military air fields or civil airfields? If the former, is it clear that commercial aircraft will not share the facilities required? (d) Is it entirely clear from this document that full control is to be exercised in the airfields by the nation exercising sovereignty, mandate or trusteeship? i e) In what way do the United States contemplate that their proposed organisations in the airfields, for which they apparently contemplate exercising responsibility, should dovetail with the main authority responsible for controlling and maintaining the airfield as a whole? (f) Is there to be a public agreement or agreements?Extract from enclosure to letter from United Kingdom Delegation, Paris, dated 6th May, 1946 . fgap in original text.) 6.

It is observed from Henniker-injor’ s letter that the intention is to ignore the American suggestion that they should be entitled to a share in maintaining the airfields; but it seems clear from the second/second paragraph of Washington telegram 1265 that the phrase ,f 2vlilitar^' rights of air transit' is interpreted by the Americans as implying continuance of their 'rijht and responsibility to assure proper maintenance of these fields in conditions suitable for military use'. lir, Henderson thinks therefore that the Secretary of.State for Inuiu and the Viceroy would find difficulty in accepting the revised forr-ivi. . a it s t a -ids * 1 lie _v /f ^^r-sriy es t that in its last sentence the wor^s 'the fields maintained in proper condition' should be replaced by 'they s^duld maintain the fields in proper conAitjLe*r'for military use'^ -&gt;r. Henderson thinks moreover that Lord Fethick-Lawrence and the Viceroy should have an opportunity of seeing the new formula and offering any comments which may occur to them before the Foreign Secretary is authorisedm to put it to Hr.

It is,tnerefore, not easy to see quite what reply is to be given to Mr. Byrnes’ approach.

( Sgd.) J. P. iS. C. Hi^IKBR-IIAJOR « H.ODRAFT FORMULA. The approach made by Mr* Byrnes on February 27th last with regard to four airfields in India and Burraa has been most carefully studied in consultation with the Viceroy and with the ^ Governor of Burma. ( As Mr. Byrnes knows, the whole constitutions! position in India is at present under discussion, and it is, therefore, impossible for His Majesty 1 3 Government or the Government of India to consider entering into any undertaking which could be held to limit the freedom of action of any future independent Government of India. Moreover, it is probable that in the event of the present constitutional negotiations succeeding, an interim period will ensue prior to the setting up of an independent Government, arid Mr. Byrnes will understand the reluctance of His Majesty's Government to undertake engagements of a nature to tie the hands of the Government of India during an interim period of this kind, when intervention of any kind will clearly raise specially delicate issues. His Majesty’s Government recognise fully, however, the interest which the United States Government have in being informed as to the future of their rights in these airfields, especially as regards the two fields on which they have under taken large military expenditure. They understand (subject to any technical comments on this point from the United States authorities concerned) that the United States Government attach particular importance to ensuring that they continue to enjoy military rights of air transit therein: they are ready/ready to recommend to the Government of India and the Government of Burma that these rights be continued and the fields maintained in proper condition for military use: they will also be willing to use their good offices for this purpose with any Government which may be formed in India during an interim period of the kind mentioned aboveB(X)U19 26th April, 1946.

The Governor confirms that the Americans have done no developcaent work at ^ingaladon and* while it seems that the American Air Transport Conkiand still enjoy the purely temporary right to which 1 referred in my letter of the 2nu April to use Mingaladon as a staging post* this involves only the right to land and there is no American ground etfJtf whatever there* nor is the airfield in regular use by the Americans. Apart from the American Volunteer Group who were in Burma in 1941-2* the only other Araerican connection with kingaladon has been that a detachment of the American Air Transport Command were there from ^ay to November, 194fc. incidentally the Governor says thau he believes that it is more than doubtful whether Mingaladon could be adapted to handle really big machines. 3 .

Nor can we, at this stage, commit the Government of India of tomorrow to ary agreement as regards these airfields.

Moreover much might depend on the length of time that may be taken to conclude the discussions. X should be grateful for your views on this point, and on the draft letter below whichi^s being prepared in accoraance with Mr. Donaldson's intentions. I do not think that it would be right to attempt to put all this to the Viceroy in a telegram. It will moreover almost certainly be necessary to cornmunicate in writing to Sir R.

As the reply to the -nitieriof^s must cover *.Iingaladon as well as ;he three Indian airfields no time would be saved therefore even if we were to telegraph to the Viceroy. it / - as it stands. In the first place I should have thought that it is up to us to decide where the discussions** s held, i.e. whether in Delhi or London.DRAFT LETTER From: IvLr. Henderson To: Lord Pethick-Lawrence / telegram No. 1264 of 27th February at flag X (passages marked) flag Y ri I n TOP SECRET You will remember writing privately to //ave 11 on 14th December last about an American request for facilities at two air bases in India. The U.3. Secretary of State again reverted to this matter at the end of February in a conversation with Balfour, our Minister in Washington, and an oral message fromB him was simultaneously delivered to the Foreign Office by Dunn of the American Embassy in London. I enclose a copy of the relevant extracts from the Washington telegram* reporting Byrnes’ con versation, and a copy of the record of the conversation* between Nevile Butler of the Foreign l Office and Dunn. 2. Since those discussions were held, the American Embassy have at our request informed us li that the four airfields in India and Burma mentioned in Byrnes’ message are those at Karachi, Agra and Dudle-^undi (near Kharagpur in Bengal) in India, and at Mingaladdn in Burma. 3. I expect that, in view of the relation which the American request has to future constitutional developments in India you will wish to discuss the 1 question with the^Viceroy and perhaps also with your colleagues of the Cabinet Mission, so far as it concerns the airfields in India. (I am writing 1 separately to Dorman Smith - see paragraph 6 below -■ about MingaladlJtn). In the meantime, Bevin is anxious that alilg^reply of some kind should be returned as soon as possible to Byrnes, since it is clear that the matter is very much on his mind at present. This is the reply which the Foreign Office now suggest for this/ purpose 'H.M.G. will certainly enter into consultation with the U.S. Government with regard to the facilities new enjoyed by the American military authorities at the three airfields in India ^/and they would be grateful to learn if the U.S. Government wish to nominate experts for such discussions either in New Delhi or in London. Pending the conclusion of any such discussions the status quo in these airfields will be maintained. It must be made clear that the Government of India^7 will not be able to commit any future Indian Government in whom control of these airfields may vest as a result of the constitutional changes now envisaged'. 4. The advice which I have recei.ved here confirms n$r view that this formula goes rather further than the Government of India could be expect ed to go at the moment Gf should, ti»ej»ofog*c, have preferred that the formula should take the form I originally suggested to the Foreign Office; this did not include the passage shown in square brackets above, the second clause of the statement being merely introduced by the words 'but they'. The Foreign Office amendment strikes me as being possibly dangerous if we were to be committed to maintaining the « status quo ca£ these airfields until technical discussions with the Americans had been concluded. Indeed^I do not see any advantage at this stage i=er a discussion between experts of what is, after all, essentially a matter of high policy. 5. As the Foreign Office are anxious to get off some sort of reply to the Americans as soon as possible I should be very grateful if you could let me have your observations bjA. tr t+h 1 Hfformula, after you have had an opportunity of discussing them with Wavelland your colleagues on the Cabinet Mission. I would then report to the Prime Minister and seek his instructions. 6. You may like to know that the case of ^lingaladUn is, so far as our information here goes, rather different. The Americans were not installed there at any time during the war, nor have they dene any development work on the airfield. The only right they enjoy - and even this may now have expired - is the purely temporary right conceded last autumn to use this airfield as a staging post for a /Transport Command Servic^from Calcutta to Singapore. I am, therefore, suggesting to Dorman-Smith that Mingaladdn might be covered by the following formula (suitably amended^, if necessarypto meet the actual position) which would the Indian bases 'Somewhat similar considerations of a constitutional nature also arise in the case of the airfield at Mingaladfiun in Burma where, however, understand that American rights have in fact been confined to the purely temporary right granted last autumn to use this airfield as a staging post on a daily Air Transport Command Service from Calcutta to Singapore'. formula eventually agreed in respect of\ KM I &amp; . •ITil M.

No. 26. TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL. Discussion took place this morning with American officials and Service representatives on subject of official Bases. Result will be reported in Embassy telegram to Foreign Office but this may not be sent for another day or so since written confirmation by the Americans is awaited on certain things. Since, however, there are some points of special Dominion interest, I am reporting these now, because I leave for Atlantic City tomorrow. 1. Manus - The Americans desire long term rights on this Island to the exclusion of nations other than Australia. It was definitely stated, however, by representative of State Department that there would be no objection to the extension of rights enjoyed by Australia to United Kingdom or other Commonwealth countries. It was made clear that United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries were to be in a special position since it was expressly stated that rights were not to be extended to other countries except by agreement with the United States when they would apparently normally be accordedaccorded only if requested as the result of decision by the Security Council of U.N.O. The long term rights granted to the United States over their present bases would not preclude the establishment of additional British bases but it was assumed in latter connexion that there would be consultation b/ Australia with the United States from time to time on the subject of defence of Manus and use of bases. It is hoped by the Americans that since they have paid for the establishment of the existing bases these would be maintained by Australia. It should be added that the Americans gave above information without prejudice to the subsequent discussion of Manus with the Australian Government. They had investigated what they needed at Manus more carefully than what they needed at the other Islands mentioned in their list and information was given primarily as example of way they were thinking. 2. Ascension - Americans proceeded to indicate what they wished to obtain at Ascension though it was made clear that United Kingdom representatives had not been instructed on this subject. I elicited from State Department representative that there would be no objection to United Kingdom joint rights being made available to Union of South Africa if this should be desired by United Kingdom. 3. Upolu - Americans made it quite clear that here as at Manus their joint long term rights would be for period preferably-3- preferably of 99 years, but certainly for not less than 50 years; that the existing base would be put on a care and maintenance basis and that New Zealand would be responsible for maintenance of such sections of it as might be mutually agreed to be necessary. The American understanding was that Mr. Fraser saw no difficulty in principle to the conclusion of an arrangement on the lines which had been suggested, though the matter was complicated by the possible necessity for the conclusion of a trustee ship agreement. I hope to return from Atlantic City in time for the next meeting with the Americans. O.T.P,(11704) Wt.-iOOOO/KaSi 10,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 Si'STi ■ Minute Paper.

I explained that we were in a difficulty in suggesting a form of words for this (which we should in any case have to get the Viceroy to agree to) without knowing which were the airfields Mr. Byrnes had in mind. ^ ^ iyjr rm now mentions four airfields in India and Burma and neither he nor Mr. Byrnes could give their names. Hitherto we have had mentioned one airfield at Karachi (presumably the Karachi Civil Airport, now in U.S. occupation) and one 'outside Calcutta'. Neither Colonel Carter nor the Air Ministry,whom he has consulted, .can throw any light on this matter and it therefore seems necessary before we address the Viceroy to ascertain from the Americans the precise location of the airfields they have in mind. We should do this very non-committally, without displaying any interest in the American request or any indication of our probable attitude towards it. I attach the draft of a letter which I might write to Mr. Butler or perhaps I might be authorised to speak to him on these lines. Gmt c*n+c*J*r$.

Halifax suggests that as matter is evidently SEND.. much in B's mind it might be well to give him a DESPATCHED 19 temporising reply. I have been asked to suggest a form of words. 4. Subject to your concurrence I am disposed COPY TO to propose to Bevin that reply should be to the effect that H.M.G. assume that the two Indian airfields in question are (a) Karachi Civil Airport and (b) an airfield outside Calcutta.

Please telegraph whether you agree or if you have any comments.t&amp;'p sreanR-r*&lt; Sir D e Monteath. I agree with you that the problem is, at a conservative estimate, 909o political. My 10^ contribution to a discussion with the Foreign Office would be to say that I disagree with Mr. Byrnes that two Indian airfields would be enough for the purpose indicated in telegram 1264 from Washington to the Foreign Office. To deal with such a contingency we should want many times that number of airfields. I feel that the India Office 'expert' should certainly come from the Political Department. If he would like to take a member of the War Staff with him I would send Colonel Carter or Major George; but I doubt if it is necessary. I cannot see that anything has happened or that anything has been said to alter the decision given by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 14th December, with which the Viceroy and General Auchinleck have agreed. /- V^' ^ V' - 4. f ^ 1 to*.

Lord Pethick-Lawrence will also recall that at an early stage certain requests were put forward in regard to bases in India. These were dealt with in a Defence Committee Paper, D.0.(45)38 of the 29th November last, and discussed at a meeting of the Defence Committee (D.O.(45)16th Meeting) on the 7th December, your Secretary of State being present. 3. We thought that these requests in relation to India had been dropped: but I enclose copies of Washington telegrams 1264 and 1265 of the 27th February from which you will see that Mr. Byrnes has now again put forward requests dealing with bases in India (and now, apparently, in Burma too) comprising four bases (as opposed to the original 2), their names not being specified. The instructions foreshadowed in these two telegrams were in fact imparted to the Foreign Office on the 27th February by Mr. James Dunn, Assistant Secretary of State in the United States State Department, who is over here for the meetings of the Deputies of the Council of Foreign Ministers. A copy is enclosed of the record of the meeting. top secret basis with the United States Government M. J. Clauson, Esq., India Office.' 4. /4.

We v/ondered, however, v/hether, as a first step, some one from the India Office would care to have a talk with our ov/n experts here, so as to get the full background of recent developments in this very complicated bases problem. There is some reason to think that, as the result of recent developments concerning relations v/ith Russia, this question of bases in India iset the moment looming large in Mr. Byrnes' mind, but there are, of course, many other sides of the bases problem with which this particular side has to be related. . 5. If you agree, and will tell me the name of your expert on this subject, I v/ill put him in touch with the people concerned in this Office. 6.

R. 2.45 a.m. 28th February, 1946. /////// IM PORTANT TOP SE CRET Folowing from Balfour. My telegram No. 1251 of the 26th February. After I had headed him away yesterday from talking abou+ British owned Pacific Islands^ Byrnes volunteered to me I 7 that he had asked United States Embassy in London to convey a message to you regarding the wish of the United States to secure base facilities on two Indian airfields about which he had already spoken to His Majesty’s Ambassador some &amp;— time ago A see Washington telegram No. 7516 of 9th November and paragraph 7 of your telegram No. 11501 of 16th November lastj^ 2. Byrnes thereupon led me up to a map of Asia hanging on the wall and remarked: 'If we and the British had the use of these two Indian airfields (when I asked him to specify them he could not do so) my experts tell me that we should have no need to be so interested in the little old Pacific islands for defence purposes if there were trouble from this” quarter” (here he plumped the palm of his hand down on Siberia). 'Naturally I could not put this in my message to Mr. Bevin but I want you to know how we feel about it'.3. It seems evident from this episode that the United States Government attach particular importance to securing base facilities in India as an advanced outpost on the periphery of the Soviet orbit. I confined myself to remarking to Mr. Byrnes that the matter was clearly one for decision by the Government of India. 1. Mr. Byrnes was incidentally at pains to assure me that the United States Government did not contemplate action in this matter which would be unrelated to the Security Council. He has since sent me a paraphrase of his instructions to the United States Embassy which are con tained in my immediately following telegram.

Following is paraphrase received from Mr. Byrnes of instructions sent to the United States Embassy in London about base facilities in the Azores and India. Acquisition of joint rights by the United States and His Majesty’s Government for long term continuation of the use of Santa Maria and Lagens Fields in the Azores by military and civilian planes of both nations has been the subject of correspondence between Bevin and myself. You are familiar with this correspondence which took place in November and December of 1945. A limitation of the negotiation to an agreement for commercial air fields was suggested by Bevin in the last oral discussion, but our military people are not satisfied v/ith such an arrangement. The present agreements have therefore been extended until June 2nd and Bevin was advised of this extension by a telegram from us sent on January 31st through the British Embassy. A further extension and modification of these agreements is desired so that, should a call be made from the Security Council, Portugal maintaining complete sovereigntysovereignty over the Islands, may be in a position to offer both fields fully equipped and ready for military use to the Security Council. We wish to approach the Government of Portugal on this extension and modification. It would be made part of our agreement with Portugal that should Portugal offer these fields at call of the Security Council our rights and those of His Majesty's Government would be subordinated to the agreement between Portugal and the Security Council. Part of the Portuguese contribution would be all appurtenant facilities. It would be appreciated if you would again have a discussion with Bevin re this proposal and indicate that we plan to discuss the subject independently with Portugal if His Majesty's Government does not wish to join in this negotiation with Portugal and in the responsibility for maintenance of the fields. On February ligth a communication was seen from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which it was requested that if possible military rights of air transit and technical stop at four — - ' air fields in India or Burma be obtained by the Department of State. We have made large expenditures on two of these air fields and our rights are about to expire on them. Recent events seemingly strengthen the belief that transit rights, including the right and responsibility to assure proper maintenance of these fields in condition suitable for military use, must be shared by other governments with the Indian Government if these Indian air fields are to be available to the Security Council at its call. A provision would-3- would be made in any agreement with the Indian Government that rights of the United States and of the United Kingdom would be subordinated to such agreement in case of an offer of these air fields by the Indian Government to the Security Council on its call. There now seems to be a possibility that during the settlement of present disputes His Majesty’s Government might insist on such rights on its own behalf and that of the United States. Should His Majesty's Government not do this, we are willing, in order to continue such rights to the Government of the United States, to approach the Indian Government. Please let me know what position Bevin adopts after you make these suggestions to him. O.T.P.United States Request for Bases. Record of a Meeting between Mr. James Dunn and Mr. N.Butler (Foreign Office) on the 27th February 1946. After Mr. Dunn had today delivered to Mr. Butler the message for the Secretary of State about the Azores (which is being recorded separately) he said that he had a further message to give on the subject of some bases in India and Burma. According to Mr. Dunn, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff had requested the State Department to take up the question of military rights of air transit, including maintenance for military use, in four airfields in India .and Burma (Mr. Dunn did not have the names), in two of which the” United States had undertaken large military expenditure and were now faced with the fact that their »rights in them were about to expire. Recent events had shown that, if these fields were to be made available to the Security Council 'on call', the rights therein, including the right of maintaining the fields in proper condition for military use, must be shared by other Governments with the Government of India. It was according ly felt that such rights might now be insisted upon by His Majesty's Government and the United States Government during the settlement of the present disputes (a somev/hat obscure phrase v/hich puzzled Mr. Dunn but which he took to mean during the discussions about to be conducted in India with regard to India's future status). Such rights, it was ! thought, should be made subordinate to any agreement which might be concluded between the Government of India and the Security Council. In the event that His Majesty's Govern ment were not ready to approach the Government of India for such rights either for the united Kingdom or the United States, the United States Government would be ready to approach the Government of India with a view to obtaining them for themselves. Such was the message which Mr. Dunn had been asked to pass on. Mr. Butler reminded Mr. Dunn that, when the United States general request for bases had first been put forward in November, a request had been made in respect of two bases in India, one at Karachi and the other an air base outside Calcutta, which the United States Government wished to see us control, and which they had asked whether we would be prepared to keep or get under our control. The Secretary of*State had told Mr. Byrnes at the time that he would find great difficulty in handling India in the way suggested /- 2 - suggested since it was virtually a sovereign state, and Lord Halifax had pointed out that these bases in India were already under the control of the Government of India and that ,the situation would presumably have to be handled through United Nations machinery. Mr. Butler, while saying that of course the message would be duly passed on to the proper quarter, suggested that it v/ouid be a tricky business for His Majesty's Government to ask the Government of India that maintenance oi their bases should be shared with other Governments. The Government of India might well retort that, while they fully acknowledged their responsibility to maintain these bases in proper shape, it was their business to take up the issue direct with the United Nations Organisation. Moreover, as the result of the discussions about to be undertaken, it was obviously possible that the status of the Government of India might be considerably changed, and this would be a diiiicult issue to inject into the midst of the constitutional discussions. ^Jr. Dunn suggested that in the latter respect the position might be eased if it were provided that any arrange ments now come to would be subject to confirmation by whatever new Government came into existence in India as a result of constitutional changes.

The United States Army Air Force (USAAF) had enjoyed transit rights for its aircraft for the duration of the Second World War (1939-1945), and desired to continue these rights for the duration of the military occupations of Germany and Japan. It contains aide memoires, correspondence, memoranda, and notes related to parallel negotiations between the Unites States and the governments of India and the United Kingdom (UK).Two copies of a report –JP (46) 142 (Final)– on these proposals prepared by the Joint Planning Staff, a subcommittee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, can be found on folios 123-135 and 137-145. They include appended maps of the route: see folios 134 and 145. A few preliminary drafts of the report can also be found within the file.Papers relating to customs, health, and passport examination of Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in India can be found on folios 27-39.Towards the front of the file are a small number of papers regarding the need for the UK to enter into negotiations with the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan in order to ensure continued air transit rights for British military aircraft.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: officials of the Burma Office (A F Morley, and Leonard Brian Walsh-Atkins) officials of the Cabinet Office (Sir Leslie Chasemore Hollis and Lieutenant-Colonel T Haddon), officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, representatives of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India, and representatives of the United States in both London and New Delhi (including Waldermar John Gallman). The file also contains a number of telegrams sent to/from the Governor of Burma and the Viceroy of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
