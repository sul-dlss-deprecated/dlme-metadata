(K 8732/2083/234). No. 99/46/44. British Embassy, Tehran, 8 th August, 1944. Dear Department, Your despatch No.124 (K 3747/2083/234) of 28th May about consular representation in Persia and India. The question has been raised again by the Persian Government - please see their note of which a copy is attached. We do not feel that the Government of India* s case is at all sound for refusing to associate themselves in the proposed formula of assurance. On the other hand, the Persians have failed to put up, on paper, a sound case on their side, and we think that it may be possible to crush them once for all by a reply on the lines of the attached draft. You will see that we have worked in at the end, with a view to pacification, a modified version of the formula already proposed by you, making it applicable to the United Kingdom only. The modification is due to the following considerations. In its present form, the ,, as3urance ,, is merely a sop which commits us to nothing beyond ’’sympathetic consideration”. When the time comes for us ’’sympathetically to consider”, we can if we like insist on reciprocity. But, in respect of the United Kingdom, as distinct from India, we have already far exceeded our most favoured nation rights, and we therefore feel that the less we talk of reciprocity the better. . In view of the line which the Persians are taking | it seems necessary to emphasise that Bandar Abbas is [subordinate to Bushire. This was stated in the Ambassador*s original Letter of Appointment issued to Rogers as Consul, but we observe that nothing is said of it in the Royal Commission. The Persians have not as yet pointed out this discrepancy, and we hope they will not do so; but if they ever do, it will presumably be necessary to issue a fresh Royal Commission making the point clear. Quite apart from our argument with the Persians, we have always regarded it as desirable that Bandar Abbas should be under Bushire (though unfortunately we do not seem to have made this point clear in our previous correspondence with you); and it would hopelessly vitiate that argument, and look very fishy, if we had now to admit to the Persians that our Letter of Appointment was incorrect in so important a respect. We should be grateful for your telegraphic approval of the draft or instructions for its modification. Yours ever, (Signed) J.S. Comers Cocks. The Consular Department, Foreign Office London, S.W. 1.TRAM SLAT IQIV. PROM: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Protocol Department. TO: HBM Embassy Mo. 7178/901. Dated 11th Khordad, 1323. 1st June, 1944. Date of Receipt: 4th June, 1944. Memorandum, - • The MPA present their compliments to H.M. Embassy and in sending the Royal Gommission appointing Mr. T. E. Rogers as British Consul at Bandar Abbas, together with.a Letter of Recognition have the honour to state as follows:- 1. After conversation made with Mr. Heppel in the Protocol Department concerning the opening of a British Consulate at Bandar Abbas; and aide memoire from the Embassy Mo.4 of the 7th Azar 1322 (29th November, 1943) stated the following: 'His Majesty’s Legation are now authorized to state that, in the event of the Imperial Government desiring to .raise any of their Vice Consulates in the United Kingdom or in India to the status of a Consulate, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or the Government of India, as the case may be, will raise no objection. It may be pointed out that according to international practice, once the creation of a consular post has been agreed upon, its grade or status is generally regarded as a question of domestic organisation and therefore as the concern only of the Government on which the post depends'. 2. As the Embassy are aware, since 1933 when the British Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas y/as closed dot/n and absorbed into the British Consulate at Kerman, H.M. Government maintained no independent Consular officer at Bandar Abbas; a single chief clerk (under the superintendance of the Kerman Consulate) was responsible for the work of the post, and since the 9th Bahman 1321 (29th January 1943) he has been carrying out his duties as Vice Consul under the superintendence of the British Consul General in Bushire, following the Embassy’s proposal and the Imperial Government’s agreement (The first Letter of Recognision in favour of Mr. Rogers was issued in this sense). 3. Information w a s given in the Embassy’s letter No.186 of the 15th Isfand 1321 ( 6 th March 1943) that local Consular rank had been bestowed on Mr. Rogers, and a new letter of recognition y/as asked for. The MPA reported the matter to the Imperial Government and asked for instructions, and on the 29th Shahrivar 1322 (21st September 1943) the Imperial Government’s decision on'? : \0i ■ on the observance of the reciprocal negotiation Y/as notified to Mr. heppel. Secretary of Embassy, in person, when he*called at the Protocol Department. • ' ■ ~~ &lt; • 1 ' ■ ■ ■ j ' 4 . It will be noted from the above that the discussions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Imperial Government’s request about the principle of the reciprocal negotiations concerned, not the elevation of a dependent Vice consulate to a consulate, but the actual establishment of a Consulate. 5 . Under the circumstances the Imperial MFA requests H. M. Embassy to confirm that the Imperial Government may reserve the right of establishing in future a consulate in one of the towns of the United Kingdom or India against the establishment of the British Consulate at Bandar Abbas. Sealed MFA. a a dm ’ r 3.1 r •. L ©‘lie ■' ’. ore.-.: u/i.^ ' Md.A. 4. 6.44.His Majesty 1 s Embassy present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and have the hpnour to acknowledge the receipt of the Ministry’s note No.7178/901 of the 11th Khordad («June 1st) concerning the British Consulate at Bandar Abbas. 2. The Embassy regret that they are unable to follow the line of argument in this note. The relevant facts appear to them to be as follows (1) A British consular post was maintained at f Bandar Abbas until 1935, when it was closed because the then existing circumstances did not warrant its continued nBihtenance; (2) n^he post was reopened in 1943 as a Vice-Consulate under the superintendence of the Consulate-G-eneral at Bushire, war conditions having rendered its reopening necessaryj and the Imperial Government duly issued a setter of Recognition to the incumbent, Mr. Rogers, without raising any question of special compensatory assurance on the part of His Majesty’s Government; (3) Later in 1943 it was decided by His Majesty’s Government to grant to Mr. Rogers the local rank of Consul; and a new Letter of‘Appointment incorporating this change of title was communicated to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in accordance with the normal px’ocedure, with a request for a nev/ Letter of Recognition. In the Letter of Appointment it was specifically indicated that Mr. Rogers would continue to function under the superintendence of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. 3 . In their note under reference the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while obligingly furnishing the Letter of Recognition asked for, apparently seek to maintain that the grant to Mr. Rogers of local rank as a Consul constitutes the opening of an independent consular post, and should therefore be compensated by an assurance on the lines adumbrated in the last paragraph of the note. 4. As stated above, the Embassy cannot follow this reasoning. The local rank which His Majesty’s Government see fit, for domestic and internal reasons, to accord to their consular representative at a given post does not necessarily affect the dependent or independent status of the latter as previously defined; and from (3) above it will be seen that Mr. Rogers remains in fact subordinate to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, under whose superintendence he has been specifically placed in the Letter of Appointment. In these circumstances, It is not understood why the Imperial Government, who recognised Mr. Rogers as a Vice-Consul ?/ithout any request for special assurances from His Majesty’s Government should make that request now that he has been granted the local rank of Consul. Nevertheless, with a view to satisfying the Imperial Government, the Embassy have already,already, in their aide-memoire of the 29th November last, furnished an assurance exactly corresponding to the only new factor in the case: they have, that is, stated that ”in the event of the Imperial G-overnment- desiring to ’’raise any of their Vice-Consulates in the United ’’Kingdom or in India to the status of a Consulate, ”His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or ’’the Government of India, as the case may be, will ’’raise no objection”. It seems to the Embassy that this was the utmost that, on any reasonable basis, could be expected of them in the circumstances, since it confirmed - albeit the confirmation was hardly necessary - that the Imperial Government were free to take action precisely similar, mutatis mutandis , to that taken by His Majesty’s Government, in the case under discussion. 5. The Embassy venture in this connexion to emphasise that the consular post at Bandar Abbas is not a new one; that, when it was closea down for a while, His Majesty’s Government neither requested nor desired the closing down of any Iranian consular establishment as a counterpart; and that it has now been reopened to meet the pressing exigencies of the war in which Iran is engaged as an Ally of Great Britain. It would seem entirely unreasonable, in these circumstances, that the Imperial Government should expect a generalised guarantee of British concurrence in the opening by them of a new consular post at some unspecified time and in some unspecified place. Nevertheless the Embassy have no doubt that, in the event of the Imperial Government desiring to open a consular post at some place in the United Kingdom where their interests were such as to render expedient the permanent residence of an Iranian consular officer, the proposal would be examined by his Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with all possible sympathy. —' ■ i——— — FJN0L03URE IN AW MAIL LETTEfc (to. -6 21 OCT 1^44 fflOM SECRETARY, bXTERNAL DEPT,, INDIA OFFICE ^(K 3747/2083/23i+) • FOKSIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 28 th May, 1 ^: Sir, i I Q -/ 5 ^ i With reference to my despatch.No 0 17th March, I have to transmit herewith a copy of a telegram addressed to the India Office by the Government of India on the subject of consular representation in India and Persia. 2.

The revised fonii^projjosed by the Foreign Office seems unobjectionable, and gives little if anything away* As regards the question of , including India, we have meanwhile received the Government of India/Express Letter of the 7th January, which makes it fairly clear that the Government of India are not in favour of any further assurance being given, though they connect the Persian Government request perhaps too closely v/ith the Bandar Abbas Consulate question which has now been settled, arguing that in the circumstances there is no need for any further assurance.

R. 1.00 p.u. 21st December, 1945. an 2. .,hen aide mfemoire was handed to hiia Chef du Protocol said he agreed that the question of the elevation of the status of^ the post was a matter of internal organisation and undertook to recommend the issue of the necessary Letter of Recognition. 5. At the same time he expressed the hope that His Majesty's Government would see their way to giving the Persian Government assurance that they would allow Persia to open new Consulates ihThe United Kingdom and in India if at any time she wishes, - as she did not at present Wish - to do so. The reason for this I desire on the Persian Government's part was,he explained, that they v/ished to put the brake on the expansion of Russian Consular representation/ If His Majesty's Government were to give the proposed assurance the Persian Government could invoke it v/henever they were asked by any Power to agree to the creation of new Consulates in Persia and could urge that any such expansion should be on similar terms. M. Sami'i made it clear that he did not expect that this would lead the Russians to allow Persia to^ create new Consulates in Russia, but he did think that, it might make^ it easier for the Persian Government to resist the expansioiR of the Russian Consular Service in Persia, which appears to be giving him some concern. 4 . I should be glad to learn whether in these circumstances you consider it advisable to give the Persian Government a written statement of what our attitude would be to any proposal to create new Consulates in the United Kingdom or in India; much would, no doubt, depend on whether other Powers had been allowed to open Consulates in the place selected and on whether Persia had any tangible interests there. I assume, however, that some formula could be found v/hich would satisfy the aim of the Persian Government without committing us too far. 5 . I consider that it would be to our advantage to meet the wishes of the Persian Government over this if we can. If we do not, we shall encounter difficulties v/henever we wish to establish new Consulates in Persia ourselves. On the other hand, if we do, we shall possibly make Soviet penetration in Persia slightly more difficult.■ MH COPY No.4 BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN • 29th November, 1943.

The appropriate letter was issued by Fia Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs and forwarded to His Majesty's Legation under cover of note No.32062/3841 of the 23rd February. 2. In the meantime His Majesty's Governaent had decided to raise the Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas to the status of a Consulate and to confer the local rank of Consul on Mr. Rogers; and in his note No.186 of the 6 th March His Majesty's Minister asked that an amended letter of recognition should be issued. 3.

The reasons for our x^oposing to revive the Consular Agency at Lingah and the Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas are explained in the minutes at Ext.1139/43 and Ext.6882/42 respectively. It will be seen from Tehran Saving telegram No.140 below that the Persian Government have now requested an assurance that they would be allowed to open a new Consulate in any British controlled territory before agreeing to the revival of Tihe Consular Agency and the grant of the local rank of Consul to the Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas. The Government of India’s telegram No.9390 and the Political Resident’s, telegram to Tehran No.429 suggest that we should take a strong line in pressing the Persian Government to agree to our proposals. Article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857 quoted by Sir R. Bullard reads as follows: 'The high contracting parties engage that in the establishment and recognition of Consuls-General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls,Consular Agents, each shall be placed inTOominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured Nation’’. It is not clear what is behind the Persian Government’s request that they may be now allowed to open a new (o &lt;&gt;J&lt;- would seem possible that they might have the Persian Gulf z. states in mind.

A Consular Office v/as estaolished at Bandar Abbas and the Consul at Kerman was to spend some months in the year there. In Junte; 1941, the Government of India suggested the reopening, with officers from India, of certain Vice Consulates in Persia, among them Bandar Abbas, and invited the views of the Political Resident and His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. The Political Resident replied that in his opinion the ’’reopening of a Vice Consulate at Bandar Aooas is fully justified by extra work entailed in Navy Certificate system'. His Majesty*s Minister, however, said that 'His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman holds that the reopening of the Vice Consulate at Bandar Aboas would not be justified either by economic warfare work or by political advantages' and suggested that a Vice Consul should be appointed at Kerman who could be detached for periods of duty at Bandar Abbas, which would have the advantage of not requiring the agreement of the Persian Government. The Government of India, therefore, when they put their proposals to His Majesty's Government, suggested only 'one officer as assistant to P.Z.137/34. Ext. 3664 / 41 . Ext.3780/41. Consul, Kerman, agreement as Vice Consul being sought later, would cover Bandar Abbas'. This proposal was sanctioned. This A recommendation by the G-overnment of India that the Vice Consul, Kerman, should be paid on the time scale of the Indian Political Service with various allowances was sanctioned in December. In July this year His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, in a telegram to the Foreign Office stated 'now that R.A.F. aerodromes are being made in South East Persia we need a Vice Consul for Bandar Abbas'. The Government of India have now telegraphed proposing to revive the post of Vice Consul, Bandar Abbas, on the same terms as before, to be superintended from Bushire with recess in Kerman. His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, has agreed to the proposal and considers that direct superintendence from Bushire might be an advantage so far as shijjping matters are concerned. The Government of India propose that the post of Vice Consul, Kerman, should be abolished, the present incumbent, Lieutenant P.F.G-. Nicholson, being sent to Bandar Abbas. They are sanctioning the post of Extra Assistant, Kerman, presumably under the present arrangement by which His Majesty's Government and the Government of India can each sanction expenditure up to ,£1,000 without reference to the other. The Government of India's proposal does not appear to involve the sanctioning of any expenditure by Ills Majesty's Government/ It is suggested that subject to the views of the Foreign Office this proposal might be approved. A draft letter to the Foreign Office asking for their concurrence is submitted. Ext.4049/41. Ext. 4144/41. Ext.4877/41. Ext.7433/41. Ext.3287/42.

S.W.1. 27th January, 1944. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in which he reports that the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs have asked for an assurance that the Persian Government would be permitted to open new Consulates in 'the United Kingdom and in India, should they wish to do so. 2. Mr. Eden does not consider that the reason advanced by the Persian Government in support of this suggestion, namely that it would assist the Persian Government to resist demands by the Soviet Government for the establishment of Soviet Consular posts in Persia, is in fact a strong one. The policy of the Soviet Government in this matter (and the ability of the Persian Government to resist it) is in Mr. Eden ? s opinion, unlikely to be seriously influenced by an assurance from His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom on the lines proposed. 3. The question can therefore best be judged in the light of the immediate interests of His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. It will be noted that, in Sir Reader Bullard^ view, to withhold an assurance on the lines that he suggests would make it more difficult in future for His Majesty’s Government to obtain the Persian Government’s consent to the opening of new British consular posts. So far as His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are concerned, it is doubtful whether the need is likely to arise to open any further consular posts in the near future. The Persian Government have already given their agreement to our proposed consular arrangements for Bandar Abbas and Lingeh; and from Tehran telegram No. 1152, of the 9th November last, it appears that His Majesty’s Minister is not in favour of pursuing the proposal to open a Vice-Consulate at Khwash or at Charbar. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for India, therefore, Mr. Eden is doubtful whether the giving of an assurance on the lines suggested by the Persian Government would in fact serve any useful purpose. 4. It is, moreover, not easy to determine the exact form that any such assurance should take. Under the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1357&gt; His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government each enjoys most favoured nation rights as regards consular representation in the territories of the other. Thus the Persian Government already have the right by treaty to open a Consulate anywhere in the United Kingdom or India where other foreign Consulates are established. Thus to give satisfaction to the Persian Government, any assurance that might ,now be given would have to grant rights more favourable than those v/hich the Persian Government already possess. At the same time, His Majesty’s Government have in practice been able to establish consular posts in certain localities in Persia where no other loreign consulates exist. Mr. Eden therefore feels that His Majesty’s Government would probably stand to lose more than they would stand to gain by any re-definition of their rights and those of the Persian Government in the matter of consular representation. 5. Subject to Mr. Amery’s views, Mr. Eden would therefore propose to put the above considerations to His Majesty’s Minister and enquire - whether/ 'iilJo.PfL- iwhether he wishes, in the light of them, to re-consider the proposal in paragraph 5 of his telegram. If, after further consideration, it should seem advisable to make any statement to the Persian Government,’Mr. Eden considers that, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the following form of words would be unobjectionable 'His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom offer 'no objection to the establishment, on a basis of 'reciprocity, of Persian consular posts' in the United Kingdom 'in districts where the interests of the Persian Government 'are such as to necessitate the permanent residence of a \ 'Persian consular officer'. 6 . Mr. Eden would be glad to learn the views of the Secretary of State for India on the foregoing generally, and in particular on * the possibility of making, on behalf of the Government of India, a statement covering India in similar terms to that suggested in, paragraph 5 above.

It is suggested that the grant of local rank of Consul to Mr. Rogers might be used by the Persian Government to secure general permission to open new Consulates in the United Kingdom or India whenever they wish. But the Persian Government have already been informed that 3 in the event of their desiring to raise any of their Vice Consulates in the United Kingdom or in Inaia to -the status of a Consulate 3 there would be no objection 3 (c.f. Tehran despatch No v 3 ik J^98/29/4;3 dated 39th November 1943 to India), and this assurance would appear to be the most that can be said to be justified, by the present case. Should any other Government seek to base a claim To expand its Consular representation in Persia on v he analogy of Mr. Roger^s'casej the facts That a British Consular post was already in existence at Bunder Abbas and that the decision whether it should be of Vice Consular or Consular status was a matter of internal organisation should be found to provide the Persian Government with a sufficient answer* Subject therefore to the....•••• 1Kxt.6268/43. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, 18th Novemher, 1943, Dear Hutcheon, / Would you please refer to Tehran Saving telegram O.140 of October 1st, about the proposed revival of the bandar Abbas Consulate and the Lingah Consular Agency. I enclose copies of the Government of India’s telegram 9390 and the Political Resident’s telegram Ko.429 to Tehran on the subject, both of which have already been copied to you officially. e are glad to see from Tehran telegram 1168 that the Persian Government have now recognised the Consular Agent at Lingah. As regards the Bandar Abbas Consulate the most satisfactory solution would seera to be that recommended by the Political Resident and the Govermaent of In. ia, namely, that the incumbent should hold the local rank of Consul, as was the case in the past in this particular post, and if the Foreign Office see no objection we would recommend that this course should be followed. This procedure would, as Prior points out, not involve the raising of the status to a Consulate and would therefore obviate the necessity of saying anything as to the Persian demand for reciprocity. We should in any case see considerable objection to any general assurance to the Persian Government that they would be allowed if they wished to open a new Consulate in any British controlled territory, and we would not go further than the assurance suggested by Bullard that in any place where Persia already has a Vice-Consulate, we should not object to the raising of its status to Consulate* Yours sincerely, h A.B.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs granted letter of recognition to Rogers as Vice-Consul Bandar Abbas on 23rd February, On receipt of India Office telegram under reference we asked for an amended letter recognising him as Consul (local rank). Ministry of Foreign Affairs now inform us orally that they regard this as amounting to the creation of a new Consulate and before granting it they wish to be assured that they would^be allowed if they wished to open a new Consulate in any British 7 (' controlled territory. 2, Before recognising revived Consular Agency at Lingeh they wish to have similar assurance. 3. Treaty position appears to be that the United Kingdom and India enjoy most-favoured-nation rights as regards consular representation in Persia, and vice versa (Treaty of 1857* Article 9, reaffirmed in exchange of notes attached to Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928), Persia also has the right .^ denied to most countries, of maintaining a consular officer at New Delhi, Question now arises as to what assurance if any regarding the opening of Consulates or Consular Agencies in places in United Kingdom and India not covered by their existing rights can be given to Persian Government. 9J K, The ease of Bandar Abbas could no doubt be covered by an assurance that in any place where Persia already has a Vice Consulate we shall not object to the raising of its status to Consulate, I have assumed that it is your inteniiion that^ Bandar Abbas should be a Consulate and not a lice Consulate m which the incumbent has the personal rank of Consul, li this assumption is incorrect the problem disappears so far as Bandar Abbas is concerned. 3* Question of Lingeh is more difiicult and if His Majesty s Government and Government of India are opposed to giving ^uy assurance I can only suggest that Persian Government should be told that they must be content with their existing most-favoured-nation rights and pressed to agree to proposed appointment/z iO ^ rO?^ ' ) f\\S- u . fi W Vu&gt; K.J ft}, n^,o INVifARD TSLEGRAM n / ^ SBCHET 41243• ( I: f ^ any case the communication of the contents ofdocument to any person outside Government Service is authorised, it must 'be paraphrased)-. .Allotted to External Department* CYPHER TELEGRAM From To Rptd*to Dated Received 9590, Addressed Secretary of State for India repeated to Minister at Tehran 530 and British Consul General Bushire* Government of India, External Affairs Department, Secretary of state for Indie.

In view of the present political situation in Iran and the urgent necessity for an increased number of officials possessing a knowledge of the country, Mr. Eden strongly supports the proposals now made by the Secretary of State for India. 3 . I am, therefore, to express the hope that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction, at a very early date, the creation of the four posts enumerated in India Office letter under reference and to approve that the financial details may be left to the discretion of the Government of India on the understanding that the expenditure involved will be shared between Imperial and Indian Funds in the usual manner.

It will be seen that the Government of India propose the creation of the following appointments (a) One officer as Assistant to H.M. Consul at Kerman, it being understood that agrdment to his appointment as Vice-Consul should be sought later. This appointment would cover Bandar Abbas. (b) One officer as Vice-Consul at Meshed.

If we are to he in the position to lend qualified officers with experience of current affairs it is essential that ?/e should plan at once to place as many officers in training as cadre limitations, financial implications end Iranian suspicions will permit. We recognise that actual volume of existing work does not justify all the appointments hut considerations stated above must outweigh this factor. We hope to reduce possible difficulties (?with) Iranian Government by only filling posts already (?recognised) or by creating posts not requiring recognition.; • 3, iVTter consulting representatives concerned and with full support of the General Staff Government of India make the following definite proposals for placing Indi^i^ Political Service Officers in Iran. / (a) One officer as Assistant to Consul?

Sir With reference to your despatch No.63 of the 6th February last relative to the issue of Royal Commissions for certain Consular Officers in Persia, I have to inform you that Commissions have been prepared for His Majesty’s Consul at Bushire and His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Duzdab and these documents have already been despatched to you. 2. With regard to His Majesty’s Consul at Bander Abbas no trace of Mr. G.A. Richardson’s appointment at any time can be found and I have to request you to furnish your views as to whether he should now be appointed and if so what district should be assigned to him, whether his rank should be that of Consul, Consul, local rank, or Vice Consul and whether in the last event he should be regarded as subordinate to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire whose jurisdiction appears to include the district which, it was hitherto assumed, was assigned to Mr. Richardson. 3. Your attention is invited to Sir P. Cox’s telegr No.951 of November 7th, 1918, and to subsequent correspond ence relative to the appointment of Mr. G.A.G. Mungavin, from which it would appear that Mr. Mungavin was given the local rank of Consul and was assigned the district of Bander Abbas up to the Khamir Boundary, the Districts of Shamilet and Minab, and the Islands of Hormuz Larak, Kishma and Henjam. The subsequent records in this department show that when Mr. Mungavin went on leave in November, 1920, Mr. A. W. Fagan took charge at Bushire (as Acting British Vice-Consul) Sir Robert H. Clive, K.C.M.G., etc., etc., TehranVice-Consul). It would appear from Sir Percy Loraine’s despatch No.390 of August 30th, 1923, that Mr. Richardson assumed charge of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate on Mr. Fagan’s departure, and his status hitherto has, therefore, been strictly that of Acting British Vice-Consul in charge of a post of which the titular holder has the local rank of Consul. I am, etc., (For the Secretary of State) (Signed) Ernest F. Gye.So. 233. British Legation, Culhek, 30th May, 1930 Sir With reference to your despatch o. 22E (IC E696/466/234) of 5th May 1930, regarding the status of Mr* G.A.Riohardson at Bander Abbas, X have the honour to inform you that it would appear that the appointment of that officer was made by the Government of India and that no notification was sent to your Department. In Lieut-Ool^nel ITnox T s despatoh No. 66/13S7 of July 26th 1923 (a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of Sir Percy Loraine’s despatch No. 390 of August 30th 1923} Mr# Mchardson 1 s rank is given as Tiae»Oonsul. I would suggest, therefore, that Mr. Richardson be now appointed Tice-Consul with the local rank of Consul, under the orders and supervision of Itis Majesty's Consul- » General, Bushire, and that the district mentioned in paragraph 3 of your despatch under reference, be assigned to him. 2, Copies of your despatch under reference and of the present reply are being sent to His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire for any observations which he may wish to fhrnish on the subject• I have the honour to b© with the highest respect Sir Your most obedient humble Servant (Signed) R.H.Clive.
