Small ears and a loop-like curl on top of the head enhance the alert expression conveyed by the eyes with their incised radiating lines. The nostrils and the mouth are also incised. The head and neck had broken from the body of the pot in antiquity and were reattached by thongs or wires laced through the holes bored at the base of the neck on either side of the break. A short-necked mouth with a beveled rim braced at the back by a small circular handle rises from the top of the animal's back. On each side of the vessel is an oval jar with a narrow mouth and beveled rim. A small vertical form on the round rump suggests the tail.", "medium": "Clay", "dimensions": "5 7/8 x 10 1/4 x 13 1/4 in.
