He urges me to move His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz to press Pars Government. At present the Eastern Rug Company estimates its losses at about 94,000 Tomans, but there is a rumour that all except horses loads were at one time safe at Daulatabad. Company has sent out investigators. I would suggest that Persian Government be pressed to send urgent instruc tions both to Pars and Kerman Governments to take immediate action. Gov ernor-General of Kerman might be ordered to move in force against the robbers whether or not in Pars territory, Pars Government if necessary bearing the expense.

C--'' a February 7th, 1915. f / 6 ^ 1 /^ i r ^ I am instructed by my Directors to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.2365/13 of the 28th ultimo, in regard to British trade with Persia. With reference to the apparent inconsistency be tween my letters of 15th January last and November 21st, 1912, I am to explain that the allusion to North Persia in the latter communication was meant to denote that very large trade in British cotton goods which up to a few years ago was centred at Tabriz, end which is to day extinct. Moreover, although a portion of the British imports which find their way into Persia through Bagdad are destined for what may be regarded by your Depart ment as the North of Persia, the bulk of then go to Kermanshah, Hamadan, Sultanabad, Isfahan, &lt;&amp;c. respect * Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrespect of the former Tabriz trade, and the Bagdad im ports which go in a southerly direction, there is, there fore, nothing incompatible in my previous correspondence ets to Russian trade. Concerning the figures relating to the imports into Culf Ports, put forward by you to prove an increase in trade despite the unsettled state of the Bouthern roads, I am to say that although the Trade Returns show an in crease of such goods, they were to a large extent only landed at the ports and could not reach their destination in the interior. Thus, whilst their value was included in the imports, the goods themselves could not and did not circulate in the ordinary way of trade, and instead of proving profitable were, indeed, a source of consider able loss. In support of this, I am to say that 424 bales landed in Bushire in December 1911 and some 1,800 bales which arrived there between January and June 191k, were on the 29th December 1912 still lying at that port, it having been impossible, ov/ing to the insecurity of the roads, to convey them to their final destination at Shiraz and Isfahan. The value of these 2,224 bales is at least £ 26 , 600 , and this is only one of many instances. I am further instructed to say that the Consular Report1 Report on the trade of Persia for the year 1911-li; (Cd. 6005-kilO) juBt iBBued, confirmB our experience that it iB just in thOBe districts where there iB any great amount of Russian trade that the roads have remained open and undisturbed, and that 'disorders in the West entirely affect British Trade and hardly touch that of our great competitor Russia'. The imports of goods from the British ftnpire (including India) during the year ending March 191&amp; show a total increase in value of £6*iO,776 over the previous year, whereas the increase in the case of Russian trade is £964,774, but, as explained above, many of the goods of British origin have been stranded for months either at the Coast or along the Roads, whilst Russian goods have circulated freely.

Sir:- I am instructed hy my Directors to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant re lative to the loss of trade in Persia. In their view the figures in the Official Report of British Trade with Persia as with other markets are not reliable and never can he hy reason of the various routes over which goods are carried. For example, this Association^ exports to Persia are largely in excess of the amount shown hy the Board of Trade Returns hecause the imports of British Trade into Persia whether they are via Bagdad, via Bombay and Karachi or via Constantinople and Trebi&amp;ond do not appear in arriving at these figures 6 lajesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. hut are included in the returns to Turkey and in a1666 degree to India* My Directors have always understood that quite 80^ of the shipments to Bagdad are destined for Persia* The Board of Trade is no doubt unaware that goods are now being shipped from Manchester in parcels bound in leather and sent through Russia to Persia at a cost of 2s. 9d. for 40 yard lengths'. But quite apart from this con sideration they think it most misleading to base an argument upon figures which would have been greatly increased had the security of the roads been effective and had not an enormous trade in the north been given away for no ap-parent benefit. Further, the decrease in the important export trade from Persia to this country which has suffered from the same cause has been instrumental in con siderably reducing the Persian purchasing capacity for Lancashire textiles. My Directors trust that the Foreign Office might yet be induced to recognise the importance of British Trade with Persia and take effective measures before it is too late to prevent it slipping away to countries who are more than alive to the great value \ itFrom No. Z88A- E . ft.

India Office to Foreign Office—(Received March 21 .) Sir, India Office, March 20, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 16th instant, regardingthe scheme prepared by Colonel Hjalmarson for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be preferable that provision should be made first for the protection of the whole road between Shiraz and Bushire. But Kunar Takhteh is apparently the last stage in the hilly country, in which caravans are most likely to be attacked, and shortly after it the road crosses the Kotal-i-Malu and drops to the plain; and it is probably Colonel Hjalmarson’s view that with a post at Kunar Takhteh*the road as far asDalaki, at the foot of the hills, would be sufficiently protected, and that the plain might be left to such a force as the Governor of Bushire may possess. Lord Crewe would deprecate any avoidable interference with the Swedish officer’s discretion, and he would suggest that His Majesty’s Government might acquiesce in the proposal on the understanding: (I) that the post at Kunar Takhteh patrols as far as Dalaki; (2) that the Governor of Bushire is made personally responsible for the safety of the rest of the road to Bushire. It will be remembered that in this last section is the village of Borasjun, a dangerous place, the khan of which is a notorious evildoer. Sir E. Grey may like to consult the political resident, Persian Gulf, before arriving at a decision. Lord Crewe observes that no provision is apparently made for the protection of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road, which, already disturbed, is likely to become more so as raiding ceases to be profitable between Bushire and Shiraz. Representations have repeatedly been made by His Majesty’s consul, Kerman, and by the firms whose propeily has suffered, and his Lordship would suggest that the Persian Government should be pressed to take measures for the restoration of order on this road as well.

After careful consideration His Majesty’s Government consider it essential at once to obtain a degree of security for British and Indian trade between Bushire and oniraz, and ^ou should therefore urge the Swedish colonel to revise his scheme by reverting to his original intention of patrolling the whole road from Shiraz to the coast, even if such a course should necessitate the temporary abandonment of the proposal to create a post to the north of Shiraz. You should also warn the Persian Government that if the Khan of Borasjun proves obstructive to the gendarmerie scheme it may become necessary for His Majesty s Government, in view of his bad record in the past, to take forcible measures against him. As regards the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road, His Majesty’s Government recognise that it would be useless to press for protective measures at the present juncture, but as that road lies within the British sphere, it has an especial claim on the attention of His Majesty s Government, and you should therefore keep steadily before the Persian Government the necessity for restoring order there at the earliest possible date.

Sir, We have the honour to place the following facts before you for the information of the Government of India and in the hope that vigorous steps will be taken to re establish order and so prevent further losses to British commercial interests concerned in the trade of Eastern and north Fersia. 2. A considerable trade is carried on with Eastern and northern Persia via Binder Abbas, mainly - so far as Karachi is concerned, by Indian Traders with headquarters in Shikar pur and Karachi. These Indian Traders deal with and are supplied by Firms like onrselves. The trade is negotiated, financed and worked from Bombay and Karachi. 3 . For many months Past, owing to the insecurity of the caravan routes inland from Bunder Abbas, this trade been very seriously hampered and ^reat difficulties and dangers have been met with in getting caravans through to Kirman and the districts beyond. 7/e have now just received from twelve of our Indian constituents at Shikarpurf\ m i) ' a Joi-t letter Wiiieh shows that trade has been brought to a complete standstill. &gt; 0u r agents', they OT i te&gt; -at Kerman and other places advise us not to despatch to them any goods on accoimt of robberies and threatened v/ar ...

In view of the serious check to British trade i which the above state^ of affairs in southern, Eastern and northern Persia involves, we beg that the Government of India will take as scon as possible the necessary stex^s to protect British commercial interests in those i J £irts, and put an end to the long continued insecurity which means not only serious delays and heavy losses to those immediately concerned but which at the same time prevents all further legitimate trade development in localities where until quite recently British trade has been supreme.
