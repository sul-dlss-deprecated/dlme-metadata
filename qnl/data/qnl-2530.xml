Rice and wheat continued to be in acute short supply in India and the Persian Gulf countries and subject to Government of India quota arrangements and other export and import controls. British and Bahrain Government officials discuss mainly the public procurement of rice supplies from Persia (Iran), India, Egypt and elsewhere. They also discuss extensively the implementation of regular reductions to Government of India monthly wheat and barley quota imports for Bahrain and the Trucial Coast, equivalent to the total quantity of their rice imports, including private importations made by merchants and others, such as the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (BAPCO), as food rations for its employees.The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent, both Sharjah; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire; the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain and the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain; the officials and representatives of the Middle East Supply Centre (later the British Supply Mission, Middle East) in Baghdad, Cairo and Tehran. A large proportion of their correspondence consists of regular reports to each other about the quantity and price of rice and wheat imports, existing stock levels, new shipments and the names of the exporters and importers involved. This information is discussed in relation to planning future cereal requirements and the purchase of new supplies, as well as for regulating the landing, onward distribution and pricing of these rationed food commodities at Bahrain and also the Trucial Coast ports of Dubai and Sharjah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Middle East Supply Centre</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Supply Mission (Middle East)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food resources</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wheat</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rice</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c5#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c5#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
