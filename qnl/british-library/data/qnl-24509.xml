Adminutratiou of Cvsloms in the Fenian Gulf.-T\w year has been rmrkpd bv tlie general extension ol the authority ot the Imperial Customs Administration throughout the Gulf, several of the minor ports where the Customs were in the hands of the Local Chiefs, having been taken over by the Department. Some captures of arms have been made in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas -md elsewhere There is little doubt that the gradual extension of the Customs Administration under European management is making the smugglhig of arms into Persia more difficult. The new Persian steamer the Mazafferi has done some useful work for the Customs Department during the year. It will be seen from the Trade Report that the new tariff has not as yet affected British trade adversely. Tea, on which the duty was greatly increased, shows a fair increase ; and indigo, on which the duty was also considerably enhanced, shows an improvement. The decrease in the import of Manchester piece -goods is probably due to an overstocked market. 5. Settlement of Claims— new Karguzar referred to in last year's Report proved unsatisfactory and did nothing towards the settlement of out standing claims. Some of these, however, have been disposed of during the year by the efforts of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 6. The Viceroy's visit to the Persian Gulf. —The most noteworthy event during the year was the visit to the Persian Gulf of His Excellency Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India. His Excellency the Viceroy in the R.I.M.S. Hardinge escorted by H.M.S. Hyacinth, flagship of Rear -Admiral Atkinson-Willes, and H.M.S.S. Fox, Po^oweand Argonaut, arrived at Maskat on the 18th November. At Maskat a grand durbar was held on board the Argonaut at which His Highness the Sultan of Maskat was invested with the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. The next place visited was Shargah on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, where the Viceroy with the escorting squadron arrived on the 21st November. A durbar was held on board H.M.S. Argonaut and was attended by all the Trucial Chiefs who were awaiting His Excellency's arrival at Shargah on board the Indian Government Telegraph Ship Fatrick Stewart, which had been deputed to collect them. Bunder Abbas was reached on the morning of the 22nd November, and here His Excellency was met officially by Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, who had come to meet the Viceroy and accompany him during his tour. His Excellency the Salar-i- Moazzim, Governor of Bushire and the Gulf Ports, was present here, having come in the Fersepolis to welcome the Viceroy on behalf of the Persian Government. After visiting the adjacent islands and the British station at Bassidore, the Viceroy proceeded to Lingah, which was reached on the 24ith. Bis Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim was here entertained to dinner on board the Hardinge. Leaving Lingah on the 25th, the Hardinge, escorted by the Pomone and the Sphinx, proceeded to Bahrein, which was reached on the 26th. Sheikh Isa, Chief of Bahrein, was received by His Excellency the Viceroy on board the Hardinge, and in the evening Lord Curzon paid an informal visit to Manameh, where ne was received by the Chief. Bahrein was left on the 27th and Koweit was reached on the 28th, where the rest of the escorting squadron had already arrived. Sheikh Mubarek, Chief of Koweit, accompanied by his eldest son Sheikh Jaber, paid a visit to the Viceroy on board the Hardinge, and on the following day Lord Curzon landed at a point three miles from Koweit, where he was met by the Chief, with a large following of mounted men. A carriage was in waiting for His Excellency who, accompanied by the Chief, was driven to the Chief's house in Koweit. The route throughout was lined by crowds of Arabs, and His Excellency's visit was marked by much enthusiasm. The Hardinge, with the squadron, arrived at Bushire on the 2nd December. Here, unfortunately, a hitch in the arrangements ordered by the Persian Government for the reception of the Viceroy prevented His ExcellencyAGENCY FOR THE TEJE IfOS-WOl. from landing.

B 24 administration report on the persian gttlf political VI I.—Persian Arabistan. m Matters at Koweit have been generally quiet and the Wahabi success is likely to strecgthen Sheikh Mubarek's position. His Royal Highness the Salar -ed -Dowleh has been Governor- General of Arabistan throughout the year. The state of the province is said to have been worse than ever, and the Shushter and Dizful districts have been very unsafe. His Excellency the Sirdar Arfa, Governor of Mahommerah, has been for the last few months in camp on the Karun, where he is engaged in making an arrangement with the Beni Truf Arabs for the payment of their outstanding revenue. At one time it seemed likely that hostilities would be resorted to, and some soldiers with guus have been sent from Bushire and Shushter to join the Sirdar Arfa. Later accounts seem to point to the likelihood of the Beni Truf submitting and an amicable arrangement being arrived at. Mr. McDouall, H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul, proceeded on leave in June and was succeeded by Major Burton, 17th Bengal Cavalry, who left again for India on Mr McDouall's return in February. Lieutenant Lorimer, I.A., was appointed His Majesty's Vice-Consul for Arabistan, and arrived at Ahwaz to take up his appointment in the end of January. The Russian Consul-General at Bushire visited the Sirdar Arfa in March and presented him with the Russian Order of St. Stanislas. viii.— Pars and (1) Shiraz. —The Asaf-ed-Dowleh left Shiraz on the 26th March 1903, being Persian Coast. saccee ^ e d by the Ala-ed-Dowleh, who arrived in Shiraz to take up his appoint ment as Governor-General on the 17th April 1903, accompanied by the Kawam-ul-Mulk. The new Governor-General soon showed his strength and the town and surrounding districts have not been so safe for many years. It was entirely due to the Ala-ed-Dowleh's firm attitude and judicious proceed ings that there was no outbreak in Shiraz during the summer of the Babi troubles, which took place in other towns of Persia. The new Governor-General also showed himself to be most energetic in the way of carrying out sanitary reforms in Shiraz, and generally repairing the palace and other Government buildings which were rapidly falling into ruins. The Ala-ed-Dowleh left Shiraz for Bushire, where he arrived on the ISth November, having been deputed by the Persian Government to meet His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India at Bushire. He return ed to Shiraz on the 23rd December and left for Tehran on the 21st Eebruary, 'having been summoned to the capital to attend the meeting of Provincial Governors which had been convened for the purpose of considering certain finan cial reforms. It is not known yet whether he will return as Governor -General for the New Year. A deputation from the Aligarh College arrived in Shiraz early in Septem ber for the purpose of explaining to the Shirazis the advantages of the educa tional system at Aligarh. They returned to India in October with a few pupils who wished to join the college. Mr. George Grahame, the newly appointed Consul for Shiraz, reached Shiraz in November. The Resident visited Shiraz in June, returning to Bushire at the end of September. (2) Ling ah. —Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah bin Saeed, the ex -Arab Chief of Lingali, arrived from the Arab Coast with 12 followers in the end of July, and went into the mountains near Lingah. He then wrote to the Deputy Governor, the Residency Agent and others, stating that he had no in tention of creating disturbances, but merely wished to lead a quiet life and he asked them to Intercede with the Persian authorities on his behalf, so that he might be allowed to settle down in some place near Lingah. Later on he asked Syed Hashim, the leading Mulla, to obtain a safe conduct for hitu* Ihis uas done but the Sheikh refused to trust it without some further guaran- e8 ^ 1S sa fety. Some sirbazes with the Mujir-es-Sultaneh, the brother or t le Governor of Bushire, were sent to Lingah.

B ushiee ; The April 1904.8 p AET ji —ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MASKAT POLITI CAL AGENCY, 1903-1904 The tribal In tlie matter of internal politics the year under review would have politics of furnished a generally satisfactory record had it not been for the sinister 0man ' activity of the sons of the Sultan's old enemy, the late Saleh-hin-ali-al-Harthi, leader of the rebellion of 1895. Since their father's death in 1896, his three sons, Aysa, Ali, and Ahmed have seldom allowed many months to pass without seeking unpleasant notoriety of one kind or another, and making themselves a source of expense and anxiety to the Sultan. The two younger brothers are restless ne'er-do-wslls of a troublesome type but possessed of littie personal reputation or influence except among such kindred spirits of their own and allied clans as are ready to respond to their call when any convenient opportunity arises for committing depredations upon ill-protected or unsuspecting neighbours. The eldest of the three, Aysa, takes after his father, and is certainly a more dignified and serious character than his brothers. He has a considerable reputation for asceticism and piety of a somewhat bigotted type, and has no small confidence in his own astuteness as a politician, but though he affects to disapprove of the turbulent vagaries of his brothers and even writes apologe tically of them, he appears unable or disinclined to put any check upon them, even if he does not give them secret encouragement. As before stated the family seldom remains in the back ground for long together, but the last occasion, upon which they made themselves especially conspicuous, was in 1901, when the first expedition was undertaken on the Sultan's behalf to explore the reported coal bearing tract in Jaalan. It will be remembered that on that occasion, realising that organised obstruction to the geologist's movements afforded a convenient means of annoying and black mailing the Sultan, the brothers collected a considerable retinue and for some weeks altogether barred the progress of the exploring party, finally contriving a treacherous ambuscade which only good luck prevented from being fraught with serious consequences. During the present year it was in the month of August that the brothers first drew public attention to themselves. During that month His Highness the Sultan had proceeded to Soor to endeavour to settle certain dissensions between the two clans inhabiting that port which bade fair to develope into a sanguinary feud which might have continued indefinitely, but he had hardly taken the matter in hand when he was obliged to hurry northwards again in the rsoor-ul-Bahr' owing to the receipt of a disquieting report to the effect that the sons of baleh-bin-Ali had suddenly migrated from the Sharkiyeh with a stiong following, and were plotting to possess themselves of the strongholds of Jlazm and llostak. It was in the first place well understood that, were they o succeed in this enterprise, they would make the Ports a base of operations or organised annoyance to the Sultan, and it was further freely rumoured that } sa aspired to set up a religious Imam in the person—if not of himself—of some puppet who would be in the leading strings of himself and his following. It may here be explained that the Ports of Hazm and Rostak with their environments have been held for some generations past by representatives of fi 6 \} Z ; Zan c3 ' Ka i s ,' collateral branches of the reigning family 's clan, ie i - ju-Seyyid.

On receiving this news His Highness at once left Maskat in the Noor-ul-Bahr for the port of Mesnaa, the nearest point on the coast to Kostak, and, having arrived there, forthwith put the loyalty of his brother-in-law to the test by sending a special messenger to him inviting him to a conference on the u Noor-ul-Bahr ' As was expected, Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim excused himself qn the plea of indisposition, and proceeded to join Aysa-bin- Saleh, who was by this time encamped outside the Fort of Eostak. The Sultan's next move was to depute Wali Suleiman with 150 men to strengthen and hold the Fort of Awabi, from which point, in the event of hostilities breaking out, Aysa's line of retreat could be menaced. Seyyid Taimoor was simultaneously posted in the Fort of Mesnaa with an increased srarrison, and, encamped outside, were a number of professedly friendly Sheikhs who, with numerous followings, had gathered round the Sultan, and were contentedly awaiting developments and being maintained at His High- ness's expense. During this time. His Majesty's ship Sphinx made frequent trips to various points on the Batineh coast, to enable the Political Agent, who was sometimes on board to remain in close touch with the Sultan, and, at the same time, to safeguard with her presence on the coast, the lives and property of British Indian subjects residing there. Though most of the latter sent their valuables into Maskat for safety, none of them were sufficiently alarmed to follow themselves, and, fortunately, matters never became serious enough to call for the issue of any general orders for their exodus. In fact, both ilysa-bin-Saleh and Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim addressed courteous letters to the Political Agent expressing friendly sentiments and their intention to use their best endeavours to see that no harm fell to British subjects or property. There was no change in the position of affairs for some time, during which the two confederates were engaged in negotiations with the object of obtaining peace able possession of Hostak fort from the party of Beni Buwaheh tribesmen who garrisoned it. Ostensibly these men garrisoned the fort on behalf of Hamood- bin-Azzan, but whereas the latter had at once evacuated his quarters there and thrown in his lot with Aysa and Seyyid, the Beni Buwaheh had other ideas, and for a long time refused altogether to admit the intruders. In the end, however, probably on the receipt of a sufficiently remunerative bribe they agreed to hand over possession of the fort to Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim. On gaining their object so far, both Aysa and Seyyid wrote letters to the Sultan in patron ising terms, informing him of their success as if it were a matter of which he would be very pleased to hear, and both went on naively to inform him by clear insinuation, if not in so many words, that Seyyid had been chosen ' Imam,' or as they put it, invested with the affairs of Muslimeen.' It is easy to imagine that the ambitions of Aysa and Seyyid must have clashed somewhat at this juncture, but Aysa must soon have realized that he himself, whatever his religious qualifications might be, was not of sufficiently aristocratic descent to gain the approval of the majority, and, that next to his own candidature the selection of a weak candidate like Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim, who would be a puppet in his hands, would be the best alternative. Nevertheless, had Aysa himself been put forward, there can be no doubt that he would have received a good deal of active support from his own part of the country, and it was well known, moreover, that, had any general call to arms resulted, Aysa s reputation for devotion to the faith was such that several influential Sheikhs had openly given out about this time that though they would not support him against the Sultan, they would refuse to take up arms against him.^ I rom the moment however that it became apparent that Seyyid -bin-Ibrahim was the best candidate that could be got to come forward, it was a foregone conclusion j ! i10 that the movement would be abortive, for the latter has neither the moral nor religious reputation to win general support from the people of Oman, whose formally expressed approval is a sine qua non of the confirmation of any candi- date as ^Imam.' While the above negotiations were in progress at Eostak, Aysa's two brothers busied themselves elsewhere, and with a small following of black le^s made raids in several directions including the outskirts of Barka, where they attacked the summer quarters of the Sultan's stable manager, killed his son wounded two of his women kind, and carried off two servants and some horses. Finding that the latter were the Sultan's property, Aysa had then sent back with a condescending letter from him to His Highness. The forts of Hazm and Rostak being now in the hands of his ally Sevvid and the suggestion of the latter as Imam having met with little or no response' it was expected that Aysa and his attendant tribesmen would now return to their country, but this they showed no signs of doing probably owin^ to the fact that prolonged drought had made the conditions of life difficult in their own villages, and that in their present quarters they were living free, either at the expense of Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim or the people of Rostak. Nevertheless, by the first week in October the Sultan, who had for nearlv two months been incurring very heavy expenses for the maintenance of a large force of friendlies on the Batineh coast and its outposts, now felt able to draw in his horns, and to limit his precautions to the retention of strengthened garrisons at the posts most liable to attack. His Highness himself now returned to Maskat leaving his two elder sons, Taimoor and Nadir, to represent him on the coast. ' From this time, although as long as Ayea and Seyyid remained together there could not be an entire absence of anxiety or sense of security, matters generally quieted down and trading operations which had for a Jong time past been paralysed were once more resumed. It was not till the month of Febru ary that Aysa-bin-Saleh returned to his country, but for the last four or five months previous he had ceased to be a source of anxiety. Apart from the above the only tribal incidents of sufficient interest to call for mention were in connection with Soor, which in some way or another seldom fails to fie-ure in ih* Administration Reports of this Agency. Soor. —The annual hostilities which almost invariably break out in the slack season between the Ghafiri and Hinawi elements in Jaalan, were pursued with no less regularity than usual during the year under review, and durino- the course of them the truculent old Amir of the Beni Bu Ali had reason to believe that his Hinawi enemies were being supplied with the sinews of war by his own dependent tribesmen of Soor. He accordingly betook himself to the^coa^t with a large following, and having encamped on the Aigeh side of the creek summoned the Sheikh of the port and gave notice that he intended to close the entrances to the port by land and sea until such time as the Sheikhs ffave him an undertaking to restrain their followers from supplying provisions to his enemies m the interior, and also paid a fine for recent offences of this nature He was as good as his word, and while he continued to press his terms upon the elders, the port was placed m a state of close blockade and trade was brought to a standstill. 110 was While the negotiations were proceeding one of the tribesmen expressed his intention of taking his dhow out of the creek under cover of the French fla? and persevered in the attempt in spite of a warning from the Sheikh that S t0 Pass. The result was that the vessel was fired at bv Sheikh Abdulla s men, and the flag itself was said to have been struck. -l? 1 ' 6 i ! 1C 3? ent at once beca tfie the subject of a claim for compensation hv have r™tcfZTrl UPOn h HiS mghnesstSultan, who is unde^d to have replied that much as he regretted the occurrence it was an accidental outcome of ordinary tribal feud such as is of every day oco Jrence to Oman Thfir P fn ®, Rould not h ° ld himself responsible to the French Government AeTnterTor ended - 8heikh Abdullal ' ^on re™d to the interior, but the ill-feeling between him and the Soori sections of his tribe contmued for some months, and eventually the town became rided agaSRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1901 itself to such an extent that early in August, when the Political A^ent paid one of his periodical visits to the British Indian community there, he found the two tribal factions inhabiting respectively the Aigeh and Mu ^reimatein divi sions of the port separated by the Soor creek, on the point of openins' fire on one another. Having succeeded in persuading the parties not to open hosti lities for 48 hours, Major Cox returned to Maskat to inform the Sultan, who at once proceeded there in the Noor-ul-Bahr and was in process of settling between the parties when he was recalled by the more important news of the ' incursion of Aysa-bin-Saleh. His visit, however, had the desired effect, hosti lities were staved off for the time, and a little later the parties were able to settle their differences through the medium of the Sheikhs of some neutral clans in the neighbourhood. The latter half of the year under review has been particularly free from tribal discord.

The approach to the harbour of Maskat from the open sea offers to the traveller a panorama which nature has endowed with an exceeding picturesque- ness of a rugged type all its own. Apart from this valuable asset the town lends itself with difficulty to any embellishment, but so far as its limited possibilities allowed, His Highness spared no effort to satisfy himself that the town and approaches should at all events look their best and in this regard it was also gratifying to remark the readiness with which the Maskat public responded and did their best, each according to his lights, to put their houses in order. It was about 10 on the morning of the 18th November 1903 that the fine R.I.M S. Hardinge bearing Their Excellencies, escorted by five men-of-war of the East India Squadron appeared in the offing and the vessels presented a truly imposing spectacle as they approached the mouth of the harbour from the north. The Sultan's flag was saluted with 21 guns as the flotilla came abreast of the signalling tower and gun for gun was returned by the Maskat Battery. As soon as the ships had taken up their billets a further salvo of 31 guns was fired as a welcome to His Excellency the Viceroy. The Sultan's Palace, his steamer, the Noor-ul-Bahr, the Forts Jalali and Merani, were profusely decorated with bunting and at His Highness's wish, in order to place in special evidence the community of interests and sentiments which bind the two Governments, the flag-staffs of the Sultan's Palace and the British Consulate were linked together by a graceful arc of bunting 300 yards in length. The French and American Consulates were also dressed as well as several of the chief buildings in the town. Shortly after the ships had dropped anchor, a deputation from the Sultan, headed by His Highness's brother, Seyyid Mahomed bin Turki, and consisting of Seyyid Taimoor-bin-Faisal, Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Azzan, Seyyid Badr-bin-Saif, Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Nasi, proceeded on board the Sardinge to convey the Sultan's compliments. A metrical welcome in Arabic was read by one of the deputation, which with drew after the usual inquiries after Their Excellencies' health, Seyyid Maho med receiving a salute of 13 guns. Shortly after they had reached the shore His Highness the Sultan em- barked in person to visit the Viceroy accompanied by his suite and by the12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Political Agent. After steaming round the entire squadron and acknowledgino the compliments of the crews of His Majesty's ships, His Highness drew up alongside the Hardinge, where he was received by the Foreign and Military Secretaries and members of the Viceroy's Staff, and was by them conducted into His Excellency's presence on the quarter-deck of the Ilardinge, which had been fitted up as a state reception room. Greetings were exchanged and a short conversation took place after which the members of the Sultan's suite were severally presented to His Excellency. Eefreshments were then served and a few minutes later the Sultan took his departure under a salute of 21 guns. Between 12 and 1 o'clock the Consuls of France and America at Maskat proceeded on board to pay their respects and were accorded interviews by His Excellency, and the salutes of their rank on departure. About 2 o'clock the Viceroy, accompanied by His Excellency Rear Admi ral Atkinson-Willes and Statf, landed at the jetty which had been temporarilv erected for the purpose at the customs wharf and were received there by the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent. As His Excellency disembarked the ships of the squadron were dressed and manned and the Viceregal salute of 31 guns fired. From the jetty the Viceregal party walked through the narrow but gaily decorated street to the British Consulate!, where the Political Agent was honoured by their company at lunch. At 3-15 p. m. a representative deputation from the various denominations of British subjects and protected persons dwelling in the Sultan's territories waited upon His Excellency with an address which was read in English by Mr, Purshotam Dhanjee, representative of a local Hindoo trading firm. It was then presented in a silver casket of local design and manufacture representing a led camel standing beneath the shade of a palmtree, the trunk of which lormed the receptacle for the vellum. Having accorded a pregnant and sym pathetic reply to this representation, Lord Curzon returned by sea to the jetty at the head ot which he was received on arrival by the Sultan. A Guard-of- lonour or British Marines with a band were in attendance at the customs w lart and from that point the street through which the partv would pass was lined on both sides by the Sultan's Arab Askaris His Highness thence con- UC ' 6 i .t! 6 1 ® ero 7 # aD ^ Ms suite to the Audience Chamber in the Palace and on a f 1 f 1 1 va ' , 101 e ^ ^ uest to a seat on his right on a raised dais at the head pi • /ru« m * were P rov ided for His Excellency's suite and the Sultan's aie cers of kState along the two sides of the room while in the further-end ana body ot the hall were accommodated 70 or 80 Sheikhs and representative mtn rom various parts of the interior who had been in vited in for the occasion. A striking feature in the room were a number of loyal inscriptions in English capitals on coloured ground which freely adorned the walls.

Fortunately nature too was at her best and graced the occasion with a smootli sea and most perfect weather, the absence or which would have made a very great difference to the comfort and eniov- ment ot the darbaris. IT.M.S. Argonaut, a fine 1st class Cruiser of 11,000 tons and the largest vessel present, was chosen as the most suitable place for the assemblage, and had her quarter-deck transformed into a gorgeous Darbar Hall bv the help of the famous kinkobs of the Viceroy's establishment. ^ ln » to fretted was that accommodation was not possible for double the number of persons, but as it was, there could not have been less than 300 present. The ceremony was notified to commence at 11-30 a. m ., but for an hour before that time boats conveying native darbaris continued to reach the Argonaut, and as the appointed hour drew nigh the booming of cannon announced the arrival, first of the Admiral, then of the Sultan, and finally, when all were seated in their places, of His Excellency the Viceroy. On the Viceroy's right, on the large raised dais, was seated His Highness the Sultan, and on His Excellency's left the British Minister in Persia, the JNaval Commander-in-Chief, and their respective staffs. Below the dais were seated the IS aval Officers of the squadron and other British Officers on duty in Maskat in full dress, and opposite to them an equal number of the Sultan's Officers of State and Notables of Oman. In the centre of the arena on either side of a large gun were accommodated the non-official darbaris and specta tors. The magnificence of the trappings and the galaxy of uniforms made the scene an exceedingly brilliant one which must have impressed itself indelibly on the memories of those present. The Foreign Secretary having by His Excellency's permission formally opened the Darbar, the Chief Arab Notables were brought up in turn and presented by the Political Agent, after which an Arabic address rich in expres sions, of sentiments of the most hearty welcome to the Viceroy and loyal friendship tor the British Throne and its representative, was read aloud on His Highness's behalf by Sheikh Rashid-bin-Ozaiz, Governor of Seraail, His Hi^hness's most erudite official; and afterwards rendered in English by the Political Agent. In reply His Excellency rose and delivered a speech which was received by all present standing', and on its conclusion was read in Arabic by Khan Bahadur Abdurrahman Hakim, Native Attache of the Foreign Depart ment. ^ The English text will be appended to this report. While the whole of it was full of interest to those present, and listened to by the darbaris with the keenest attention, the culminating point to them was no doubt reached when at the end of his address His Excellency announced that he had that morning received the gracious permission of His Majesty the King-Emperor to confer upon His Highness, Seyyid Faisal, the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Indian Empire. With'this auspicious announcement, which was received with much applause, the Darbar was declared closed, and His Excellency then retired to a robins room to prepare for the immediate investiture of His High- ness. A few minutes later lie returned to the throne on the dais dressed inADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL his robes of a Grand Master of the Order, and the Chapter having been formally opened the Sultan was conducted before the Viceroy with the usual ceremony by the Eoreign Secretary and duly invested with the Ribbon, Badge, Star and Collar of the Order. The gathering then broke up, His Excellency leaving under the same salute as that which greeted his arrival, followed by the Sultan and Admiral a few minutes later. After leaving the Argonaut the Sultan proceeded direct on board the Hardinge for a short personal interview with Lord Curzon, and also to take leave of bim, as His Excellency proposed to leave in the course of the afternoon. The two days of the Viceregal visit had been observed as a public holiday in Maskat and the fete culminated in the afternoon, while the squadron was preparing to get under way, in a series of native dances on the strand in front of the British Consulate, where some 20 or 30 bands of nimble dancers in grotesque costumes and disguises disported themselves until nightfall. Thus ended a most august event in the history of Maskat which the Ruler and his subjects have every reason to remember with the liveliest pleasure. As the principal addresses which were delivered in the course of the visit have a permanent interest and importance, the full text of them is here ap pended for facility of future reference. I. Address presented to Sis Excellency the Viceroy hy the Community of British subjects and other British protected persons in Maskat. M ay it please Y our E xcellency, We, the entire community of British subjects, Hindu, Muhammadan, Parsi, and other British protected persons, settled in the towns of Maskat and Mattra, most respectfully beg, on behalf of ourselves and our fellow subjects residing in other parts of His Highness the Sultan's dominions, to offer Your Excel lencies a most heartfelt welcome on the occasion of your visit to Maskat. In doing so, we venture to congratulate Your Excellency, with much respect, on being the first Viceroy and Governor-General of India, since the passing of the destinies of the Indian continent to the British Crown, to visit these distant shores, and to have thus inaugurated a new and vigorous political departure in a sphere where so many Indian interests are involved; and it has been a source of enhanced gratification to us to know that since Your Excel lency's happy decision to accept an extension of your term of office (a decision which has been received by all classes of His Majesty the King-Emperor's subjects with lively satisfaction), the first great act of policy which Your Excellency has undertaken has been this most auspicious tour in the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. Accustomed as the races peopling these shores are to receive impressions from outward appearances, we cannot but feel confident that this happy under taking will prove to be an epoch-making event in the progress and enhance ment of British prestige and influence. It will serve, too, as an abiding demonstration to the inhabitants of the littoral that the preponderating influence of Great Britain in these waters is no shadowy or remote force, but a lively and dignified reality, and that the Viceroy of the King-Emperor, who holds benevolent sway over the millions of the vast continent of British India watches with no less zeal and keen interest the welfare of His Most Gracious Majesty's subjects scattered all over the Gulf. Except to give Your Excellencies a respectful and hearty welcome, and to give expression to our loyalty and devotion to the great Government whose subjects w 7 e are, we have little cause to trespass on Your Excellency's time, acd, so far as our own local and particular needs and circumstances are concerned, have an encouraging tale to tell.residency and mask at pol itical agency foe the year 1903.1901. 15 Wg enjoy in Maskat the rights and nriviles'ps nf fvm c t our interests are carefully guarded by our 0 Consular authnrit' ^ tl0D ' experience complete toleration in matters of reliaion There t t W f unnecessary litigation amongst us, British suliipnte ,,,, ,1 • , . . absence of promptly obtainable in the .Agency Court!

T . ha ?! iS t0 f the Ti filant activity of successive Political Agents and of Bntish Men-of-war at seasons of unrest, there is little actual danger to the hves and properties of these our fellow-subjects, but the detriment to their trading operations and ours is great, and we venture to hope that Your Excel- lency s Government will see its way, either by strengthening the bands of the ruler, or by active interference on the coast where necessary for the preserva- tion ot British interests, to take measures which will deter the unruly tribesmen of Oman trom disturbing the commerce of the country by their dissensions. dnnW C - &gt;mmerce generally, we continue to prosper, and though Indian imports nde^tlie inarket DOt wanting of foreign competition, There is one depressing factor, however, of comparatively recent growth 0 which we make bold to draw Yonr Excellency's benevolent attention, and that as the demoralising fluctuations in the silver exchange. Since the closing of the Indian mints in 1893, and the consequent fall in the price of silver, the local Dollar exchange has not ceased to exhibit remarkable fluctuations, which greatly prejudice and impede the local import trade, from the fact that the currency value of the rupee is fixed and that of the Maskat Dollar is not. We therefore humbly commend the matter to Your Excellency's wise consi deration m the hope that, in co-operation with the local Government, some means may be devised of bringing about a better state of things. ... If 1000 elusion, we beg to reiterate our welcome, and to assure you that ins Visit of Your Excellency and your gifted Consort will be a landmark in lie history ot Maskat and will live green in our memories ; and it is our earnest prayer before the Supreme Being, in whose hands the destiny of all or us lie, to vouchsafe to Your Excellency a continuance of bodily health and strength to enable you to render further great services to the Empire and to bind fresh laurels on your brow. We beg to subscribe ourselves Your Excellency's most humble servants. II. ■His Excellency'8 reply to the foregoing. G entlemen, It is with much pleasure that 1 have received the loyal and well composed address which has just been read, and that on crossing the sea from India to16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL flip shores of another country I find a large and prosperous community of the hipcts of His Majesty the King-Emperor existing and plymg their trade Win conditions of security and contentment. I have made some attempt fo ascertain the numbers of British Indian subjects who are thus to be found in Mnskat and other parts of Oman, and I find that they amount to no fewer than 1 300 persons, the majority of whom came originally, or come now, from the opposite shores of Sind and Kathiawar. The fact that these two coasts face each other at so inconsiderable a distance and the well known aptitudes of the particular communities that you represent sufficiently explain the close mercantile connections that have grown up during the last century between Maskat and India and leave one in no surprise at the commercial predominance of Great Britain in the trade and shipping of this State. Gentlemen, the political stake of one country in another is sometimes measured by its commercial interests, but does not always lend itself readily to precise or mathematical definition ; on the other hand, the commercial stake is more easily reduced to figures and calculations, the effect of which is not open to dispute. I will take, for instance, the time in which I have been connected with the Government of India, namely, the last five years, when I find that during that period the British proportion of trade with the port of Maskat has averaged 84 per cent., and that of the total number of steamers that have entered and cleared from this port in the same time the average British percentage in each year has been 97* I am satisfied that the predominance of Great Britain in the mercantile interests of the State is supreme and incontestable, and I realise that in addressing you I am receiving a body of gentlemen who represent a not unimportant outpost of British commercial enterprise in the East and whose labours have contributed and still contribute in no small degree to the material welfare of Oman. I am glad to hear from you that in the pursuit of this peaceful avocation your interests are safe guarded by the successive Political Agents—and by none I am sure more diligently than by Major Cox—who have been sent here to represent the Government of India. That you obtain justice, that you abstain from litigation, and that you enjoy complete religious tolerance-i-these conditions are all favourable to the success of your operations, and they leave you with little ground for complaint. In one paragraph of your address you have spoken of the disturbances that sometimes spring up in the interior and which occasionally travel down to the coast ports and affect the security of the places in which you reside. The British Government have never embroiled them selves in this internal strife which appears to be a hereditary legacy in Oman, but undoubtedly if it were to reach a point that seriously menaced the interests or imperilled the lives and property of British subjects, lawfully trading upon the coast, we should feel called upon to intervene for their protection, and by no one I am sure would such intervention be more loyally welcomed or more cordially assisted than by His Highness. You have referred in your address to the depreciation in the local exchange. This is a matter which I will take into consideration. Gentlemen, I am obliged lor the kind words in which you have welcomed me to Maskat. I understand that among those who present the address are representatives of other communities, such as the Portuguese of Goa, who enjoy British protection in this State, To all of you I wish a continuance of the conditions under which your trade exists and flourishes in Oman, and I rejoice that there has been presented to me the opportunity, while I am the head of the Government of India, of testifying the interest which I feel in this outlying Colony of Indian influence and trade. It only remains for me to thank you for presenting your addiess in a specimen of silver work so characteristic of the tastes and customs of the locality. It will always be a memento of this agreeable meeting on 6 occasion of my present visit to Maskat. His Highness Seyyid Faisal's pnhlic address to the Viceroy at the opening V the Darhar on II,M t S. Argonaut. Youn E xcellency, I trust it will not be amiss if I take advantage of this auspicious occas ^ ( to convey to Your Excellency some public expression of the pleasureRESIDENCl AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903 -1904 ] 7 honour which it affords to me and minp in flia i 7V, welcome Your two Excellencies and His Excellencv the Admfral 0 and vn ^ imposing and distinguished escort to our modest capital of Oman, and in the second place to be thus afforded an opporlunity of manifesting our sentiments ot sincere friendship and attachment to that Great Government of Ind a wMch Your Excellency directs and to His Majesty the King-Emperor of happy name whose Viceroy and proxy you are m these far off climes. appy name It is now more than a century since my forefathers first entered into treaty relations with Great Britain and that an English Resident his represented the Great Government in our Territorv anH o i • j before that Maskat had been in constant commercial 'touch and in^rcoart with the English through the trading ports of India. n^icourse Buring that period the Rulers of Oman have been on terms ot the closest riends np with Great Britain and at many of those hours of need and difficulty which are wont to arise so suddenly in an Eastern State I and my forebears haye been lie greatful recipients, on innumerable occasions, of that mora and substantial support which the British Government in the person of the Viceroy of India has been ever ready to afford. I am therefore in no wav diffeient from my predecessors m owing a large debt of gratitude to the iceroy ot India, but there is one point in this connection in respect of which I do stand alone among the Seyyids of Oman and that is in experiencing the great honour and pleasure of being able to welcome a Viceroy of India in person to Maskat and to express my feelings to him face to face: and it is with grateful appreciation and with the knowledge that my relations and my lova subjects will fully endorse what I say that I declare that at no time in Maskat history and from no Viceroy has greater sympathy and kindness been extended to us than by this great Viceroy, Lord Curzon, whom I am privileged to address to-day I consider myself particularly fortunate therefore in being able to testify before this august assemblage to the reality of our obligations and the sincerity of our appreciation of them. More than this I be| Your Excellency to believe me when I declare that neither I nor my brother nor my children should they be called upon to follow after me will ever cease to be mindful of the claims of that strong and ancient friendship which in time past has kept secure the bonds of union existing between Great Britain and ourselves, and that we will at all times remain loyal to those ties. I am afraid that Maskat offers few attractions to the experienced traveller, and except to put our houses and highways in order as far as circumstances have permitted and to proclaim a general holiday during Your Excellencies' august presence here there has been little that it has been possible for us to do in honour of this great occasion. In this regard I can only ask Your Excellency to call to mind the sentiments of the poet who sang— It is not every thing that a man wants that he can achieve; nor can the speeding barque command the wind that she listeth.' At any rate I hope that Your Excellency and your fair and precious Lady, Her Excellency Lady Curzon, will not carry away with you from Maskat any but kindly recollections.' IV. Sis Excellency the Viceroy's reply to the ahove. Y oijii H ighness, Y our E xcellencies, and G entlemen, Your Highness has already addressed me yesterday in terms of warm welcome to your Capital and State, and to-day you have anticipated much of what I desired to say in the Speech which you have just spontaneously delivered, in which you have spoken in feeling language of the historic con nection between the British Government and the State of Oman. It was Your Highness's own great grandfather with whom the first treaty was concluded with the East India Company 105 years ago. As you have further reminded me, for more than a century has a British Representative been stationed at DIS ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Maskat, and during that time the friendly intercourse between the two Governments has been demonstrated by a series of treaties or conventions of which I can trace no fewer than nine, and which have provided for the closest political and commercial relations as well as for the suppression of the siav trade and of piracy, and for the extension of the electric telegraph. This series of agreements not only sufficiently testifies to the connections that have grown up between the two Governments and that have linked the State of Oman to the British Government by quite exceptional ties, but thev have also been strengthened, as Your Highness has pointed out, by the support which has been given on critical occasions by the British Government to successive Rulers of Oman, while a further and natural bond of union is supplied by the facts that Maskat lies just opposite to the shores of India, that its trade is not only for the most part with India, but is largely in Indian bands, that a large number of British Indian subjects reside here, and that the prosperity of the State is mainly dependent on these conditions. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government of India should feel a particular interest in this place, or that a Viceroy of India should desire to visit it and to make the acquaintance of its Ruler. His pleasure in doing so is greatlv enhanced when he learns from Your Highness's own lips that you and your children will ever be mindful of these strong and ancient obligations and that to them you and they will always remain loval. These arp wnrrlc which I shall cherish in friendly recollection, not only on my owa behalf, but on behalf of the Government which I represent Your Highness has now ruled your State for fifteen years. I had the pleasure of visiting it when you had only just succeeded fourteen years ago, and I am glad to congratulate Your Highness on the progress that has since been made. The volume of your trade is steadily increasing, the wise step which the Government of India so strongly urged on Your Highness a few years a^o of taking over the customs of your State in preference to farming them' to others, has been attended with largely increased profits, and it gave' me much satistaction, two years ago, with Your Highness's permission, to brino- your capital into still closer connection with the outer world bv lavino- a tele^ranhio cable from Jask to Maskat. I also personally selected Major Co? asau o&amp;cer m whose discretion and ability I had perfect confidence, to represent the Government of India at your capital, and Your Highness has already assured rne that you have found in him a prudent councillor and friend. At Delhi m January last, though Your Highness was unable to accept mv in vitation to the great ceremony that we held to celebrate the Coronation of His r r ^ est y j King-Emperor, I had the pleasure of welcoming your son, iaimur, and of conversing with him about the condition and welfare of Oman. ave re ened to the fact that the British Government have extended a peculiar measure of protection in the past to the State of Oman and its u ers. I iey have on more than one occasion intervened to save it from rebellion or disruption. Your Highness may rest assured that this policy will fv, • f e J )ar e rorn * So long as the Rulers of Oman continue to observe ui lea y engagements to the Government of India, and to administer this r? 1 ^ enmeu ^ ant i justice, they will continue to receive the support e n is i overnment, which is interested in preserving the peace of the ^ r 16 secui 7 t ^ ^ ^ ts tra de.

I have still one agree- pei orm. Only yesterday I received the gracious permission■ tyf RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE TEAR 1903 -1904 18 of His Majesty the King-Emperor to confer upon 'iour Highness tl,p l ;„ l honour of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Indian Empire This rtk tinetion will he a proof to Your Highness of the sincere sentiments of friend ship which are entertained towards you by the British Government and it is also a recognition of the loyalty to which 1'our Highness has given such fervent expression on more than one occasion in the course of yesterdav and to dav It will now he my pleasing duty as Grand Master of the Order to nrocsed tn the due and solemn investiture of Your Highness. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel C, A. Kern hall, Resident's C.I.E., visited Maskat in Apul 1j03 and again in November a few davs A s eut ' s visits before the arrival of His Excellency the Viceroy. ' L The Political Agent made several short trips to various coast ports during Political the year, including Khor Fakan, Mureir, Shinas, Saliam, Sohar, Suweik tours Khaboora, Mesnaa Barka, and Seeb on the Batineh coast and Soor to the south of Maskat. No inland tours were found practicable this year, as in the spring and at the beginning of the cold season, the two most favourable times for touring, important events were taking place which necessitated the Political Agent's remaining in Maskat. The administration of the Maskat and Mattrah customs, which continue Administration to be under the direct management of the local Government, has been satis- of customs, factory so far as the relations between the Customs Superintendent, his staff, and the trading public are concerned, complaints from merchants having been few during the year and easy of adjustment; but a system by which sudden calls on the State Exchequer are met by drafts upon the Customs Superintendent is obviously unsound, and liable- to place that official in frequent difficulties and to prevent him from doing full justice to his charge. Judging from the trade returns which the local Government is good enough to supply, the revenues calculated on the volume of trade must again this year have reached the highest figure they have yet touched chiefly owing to a strong boom in arms just at the end of the year, the causes of which are not quite apparent. With such an improving revenue, if the Sultan's fiscal administration could be conducted on somewhat more business like lines, the financial position of the Euler would be on a sounder footing than ever before. His Highness Seyyid Eaisal has in the last few years shown such a ready inclination to profit by Western ideas in details of his Adminis tration, that there is every reason to hope that enlightened progress will ultimately be introduced also in the direction under reference. Meanwhile it is a pleasure to record this year a continuance of the great improvements (the inception of which was mentioned in last year's report) to the customs premises under the direction of the new Superintendent. The new storage warehouses, sheds, and offices have now been completed, and the merchandise of importers is well protected against the elements, and the ingenuity of those light-fingered gentry who formerly so frequently levied toll on it. The temporary pier run out for the Viceroy's visit found so much favour with the public that the idea of having a permanent structure has been mooted, and it is hoped will ultimately take shape. That it will be an expen sive undertaking goes without saying, as nothing but very solid work will with stand the force of the Sliamal winds and heavy seas which are prevalent in the harbour during the winter months. The cost should not be prohibitive, however. This branch of administration has continued throughout the year to be Gwadur a frequent source of worry to the Sultan and to the offices of the Political Custom8 - Officer for the Mekran coast and the Political Agent at Maskat. Ever since the late Khoja contractor was ousted from the customs farm, and the collection of customs dues resumed by the Sultan, there have been constant dissensions between the mercantile community and His Highness's customs officials regarding the tariff. In time past this had been fixed without any method, and numerous privileges and complicated customs had gradually crept in which the merchants are now very loth to change or give up, and which at the same time are extremely difficult to administer. The efforts of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and the Political Agent to hold the scales and assist towards an amicable settlement have proved abortive and at last in the month of February His Highness the Sultan proceeded to Gwaduu D 220 ADMINISTHATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL and spent some time there himself, and it was confidently hoped that he would then arrive at a satisfactory understanding with the Gwadur public and fix a workable tariff. Unfortunately just at the close of the year a fresh batch of disputes have arisen which will further delay settlement, meanwhile the Sultan has lost and is losing a considerable amount of revenue and on the other hand the merchants there remain dissatisfied with the state of things and are inclined to transfer their trade to other ports. Seif -bin-Yaarub, who has acted as Wali at Gwadur during the year, seems to be giving satisfaction in the discharge of his duties, and the frequent complaints which were made against his predecessor do not appear to arise against him. It will be observed from the trade returns that the volume of trade in arms and ammunition increased considerably during the year, the total value thereof being 861,810 dollars, repre^nting an increment of 427,900, or 93 per cent,, on the previous year's figures. The local market was normal during the first nine mouths of the year, but during January, February, and March, the demand suddenly increased and exceeded the supply to such an extent that during January the ordinary retail rate per rifle in the bazaar rose from 32-35 to 50-55 dollars, and consignments in transit from Europe were sold in advance at r.ites varying from 42 to 48 dollars per weapon. In consequence of this sadden boom practically no stock in hand remained on the mercliants' books at the end of the year under report. The following are the proportions of the trade taken delivery of by the several nationalities concerned in it: — Per cent. Arab subjects , , , , , , .15^ British do. ........ 35| Foreign do. 49 These figures tell their own tale. Maskat has remained quite free from epidemic disease of any sort and the public health has been on the whole good. Strict quarantine has been maintained against India, the duties of Health Officer being performed as usual by the Agency Surgeon, under whose careful supervision preventive measures were carried out with an entire absence of friction. One unpleasant incident, however, occurred at the beginning of the year under review. Early in April three Soori subjects of His Highness the Sultan who had arrived in Maskat as 2nd class passengers by the mail steamer from Bombay, broke quarantine while undergoing the usual period of detention under medical observation and absconded after dark in a native sailing boat, intending to make for Soor. On the way they called at Bander Jisseh evidently in pursuance of a pre arranged. plan, and picked up two fellow tribesmen who had accompanied them irom Bombay, but who being deck-passengers had been sent to the quarantine lazaretto a couple of miles down the coast. On their fiight being reported to the Sultan in the morning he requested that His Majesty's ship J?erseu8, which was then lying in harbour, would place her launch at his disposal for the pursuit of the truants. This request was acceded to, and His Highness's Arab quarantine Superintendent was despatched in her m pursuit. There had been little or no wind during the night and the launch came up with the small dhow containing the Sooris about SO miles from Maskat. As the steam-cutter hove in sight the Arabs made for the shore, but weie unable to escape owing to the precipitousness of the coast, and were sa e y brought back to Maskat, and in the morning were awarded a term of imprisonment by* the Sultan. It turned out, however, that three out of the \e c aimed to be exempt from the Sultan's jurisdiction on the ground that ley owned dhows flying the French Flag, and a representation was forthwith mace ytheirench Consul demanding their release as French proteges. To us request, however. His Highness did not feel able to accede, and consulted .tie British Government in the matter, with the result that it was discussed e ^en His Majesty's Foreign Office and the French Government, and an arnica e arrangement arrived at, by which it was settled to refer the wholeI ' le H 10,6 of fL 'I- Nut of % sfied,!,!, ''it ttb ''S- duti Cr fin '^'Ufirfv 5 l fle Tear, ^ - istket T.feka Pf'no niia ifle in ®f fl ier remained ie taken . . 351 3 disease of aojswti Jtrict qoaraoiiae k :er beinjperfoislii sion prereiitirs k ]er rerieff, Bombay, under nteiidio^o ■ in io harbour, This r&lt; ptbenl^ 1 . 5 ns ^ 'i'l'S (i fer, ion on 11 esen^ 1 ' 00 .easfre 1 i Gorers 1 rfedt 0 EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904 21 question of the French Flag in Oman to arbitration by the Ha-ue Tribunal On receiving this satisfactory news His Highness the Sultan was pleased, on the advice ot the Government of India, to release all five delinquents from confinement after a month's incarceration.

Owing, however, to the difficulty experienced in importino 1 masons^ and coolie labour from Karachi as the result of stringent emigration regulations in force there, it was found necessary to extend the .period of the contract, and a good deal of work still remains to be done. Improvements have been carried out at the coal depot, including the Makullah eova reclamation of a piece of the foreshore from the sea in order to replace the loss of storage space resulting to us from the presentation of a moiety of the original space to the French Government for storage of their coal. A stone jetty has also been thrown out from the sea wall which it is hoped will expedite coaling operations by saving coolies fatigue of wading. The wreck of the S.S. jLwjItojX Gucydon, In JVIay last a large French liner, the Amiral Gueydon, bound from Havre to the far east with passen gers and cargo, caught fire when in the neighbourhood of Socotra owing to an explosion in her fore hatch, and her Commander decided that the only chance of saving the lives of his passengers and crew was to turn the ships head to leeward and run her ashore on the coast of Southern Arabia. This he was successful in doing, and he could hardly have chosen a better spot than that chanced upon, namely, the soft sandy strand under the lee of Eas Hasek near Dhofar in the Sultan's territory. The Monsoon having by this time com menced, communication by native craft with Maskat or elsewhere was impos sible owing to the heavy sea running, and a messenger sent overland never arrived, so there the unfortunate mariners had to remain until the season opened again. For four months the ship's company and passengers consisting of 350 men, one lady and two children were encamped on the strand alongside of the smouldering ship in rough tents made of awnings, etc., and provisioning themselves from the ship's stores. During that time they appear (from the account given to the press hy the Commander) to have been treated with surprising humanity by the wild Gara and Mahri tribesmen who inhabit that inhospitable coast. After they had been there a short time the news of their shipwreck reached the Sultan's Governor at Dhof'ar, and he at once joined them in person and gave them the protection of his presence until the monsoon sea subsided, and it was possible for him to hire dhows to take the party to Maskat. In due course, on 12th September, he procured three dhows and the whole of the shipwrecked persons after storing a large quantity of provisions in the dhows left in them for Maskat escorted by some representatives of the Wali. On the voyage thither, they were encountered by the Russian mer chantman Trouver homew r ard bound, taken on board, and safely landed at iVden a few days later. It is interesting to note that the Amiral Gueydon was ultimately raised by the salvage steamer of the Perim Coal Company and reached Perim safely at the end of December, at which time she is said to have been still smouldering, seven months after she caught fire !Navy.

Eighty-eight fugitive slaves took refuge at the British Consulate. Of these, 84 were freed with the consent of the Sultan, two were found not to be entitled to freedom, and two left the Consulate while their cases were under enquiry. The gang of Soori slave runners, whose capture to the number of about 150 at Mozambique was mentioned in last year's report, were sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment and deported to Angola'in West Africa. This should have a salutary effect on the Soor community. Major P. Z.

A. KEMBALL, c .I .e., HIS britannic MAJ- ESTY'S ACTING CONSUL-GENERAL FOR FARS KHUZISTAN ETC. General remaps—Contrary to the hope expressed in the previous Tear's report, there was a considerable decline in the amount of imported woods in the year under review as compared with the previous year; but despite that fact the yeai 190o may be said to have heen more favourable for operations. The harvest was normal and the cultivators were in a position to put the market their surplus stuff at fairly remunerative prices. The consequent improved condition of the cultivators comhiced with the introduction of the new Tariff proved a welcome boon to importers who netted handsome profits on the previous year's stocks and otherwise did fairly good business in new goods. Thus, taken all loundj the year 1903 may be safely said to have given satisfac tion generally. Customs Tariff. —The unpleasant feature of the new Customs Tariff is the difficulty and delays which are experienced by the merchants in clearing their goods, owing to the bulk of the imports having to pay duty by weight.' This system is more harassing to Persian and British Indian merchants, who find it difficult to understand the intricacies and details of measurement, etc., and are thus left at the mercy of the Customs officials. Apart from this it does not appear to have in any way affected the trade of the Gulf. As an example of this it may be pointed out that Tea and Indigo, which are heavily taxed, have held their own in the year under review. Imports. —The net decrease as gathered from the statistics is E52,28,730, of which Bushire is responsible for E22,53,644) and Lingah £51,63,631; while there is an increase of El,88,545 in the imports into Arab Coast. The principal articles which contributed towards the decline in the imports of Bushire are : cotton piece goods R 19,40,000, rice R3,50,000, porcelain and Chinaware R43,500, provisions R3,00.000, loaf sugar R2,72,800, and soft sugar R9,93,500. The following articles show an increase in Bushire, viz., Indigo E2,26,000, Hardware R3,09,600, Matches R65,800, Candles R42,800, Metals R2,00 s 000, and Specie E5,36,400. The chief articles which contributed towards the decline in Lingah are Pearls R22,95,000, Wheat R2,98,400, Barley R74,100, Rice 8,87,400, Provisions E83,000, and Tobacco R43.100. The following arti cles show an increase in Lingah, viz.. Coffee E2,06,000, Sugar loaf R27,800 and Sugar soft R48,800. Tea. —According to the new Tariff the duty on Indian tea is 6 krans per batman of 6| lbs. which works out at about 50 per cent., while the duty on white tea is 10 krans per batman, and the percentage works out more or less to the same figure. But it may be noted that the Batavia tea, which is coming into favour and forms the bulk of import under China tea, pays duty at about 38 per cent. This is due to the fact that for duty purposes a chest of Batavia tea is taken to contain 20 per cent, of white leaves and 80 per cent, black, and thus two rates of duty are charged, viz., 10 krans per batman on the former propor tion and 6 on the latter, or, in other words, a chest taking it to contain 10 bat- mans pays a duty of 68 krans. Roughly speaking', the price of Batavia tea is about 18 krans per batman and that of Indian 12 krans. It will be thus seen that the former enjoys a decided advantage over the latter, but it would be premature to hazard an opinion as to the ultimate effect which this differentia tion of duty will have upon the import of Indian tea. There is, however, this much in its favor, that it is consumed by the mass of the people who find it stil). comparatively cheaper and are not therefore likely to favour tue superior sort. * ■24 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL In the year under review the Indian tea has held its own and the total imported as shown in the statistics is R9,74,034, or an ircrease of E52 s 474 over the previous year; ^virile the total quantity of Batavia tea imported is fi3,83,104 or an increase of 111,80,288. Xud/icjOt—1 he duty on this articlej according to the new Tariff works out at about 31 per cent, instead of the 5 per cent, ad valorem yhidh used to be paid in former years. Notwithstanding this heavy duty, the imports into Bushire amounted to R32,00,000 or an increase of R2,26,130 over the previous year. This substantial increase shows that the duty under the new Tariff is not likely to affect its importation injuriously, and the more so because of the strict pro hibition enforced against the importation of aniline dyes, which to a great extent used to affect the trade in this article in former years. Exports. —There was a marked increase in the exports from Bushire and Arab Coast amounting in the former place to E12 3 32,605, and in the latter to 1^10,77,375. The items which contributed towards the increase in Bushire are : Horses R30 5 000 5 Coffee HI,15,700, Grain fil,15,200. Gum and Mastics E2,05,000, Hides and Skins E65 5 900, Opium R4,81,000, Tobacco 1160,700, and woollen piece goods E2 ,43,500. The increase in the Arab Coast is mainly due to pearls, viz., R10,00,0u0 ; while in the exports from Lingah there was a net decrease amounting to E84,26,970, of which pearls alone are responsible for E33,00,000. The decrease in the exportation of pearls from Lingah is due to their having been sent direct to India from the Arab Coast, instead of being brought to Lingah and then re-exported as used to be the case in former years. The reason for this direct shipment was to avoid the payment of 5 per cent, duty which the Customs authorities demanded instead of the nominal dutv which used to be paid formerly. But the chief cause which induced the direct shipment was the imposition at Lingah of 5 per cent, duty on dollars, which used to be largely imported there for the purchase of pearls. The Customs authorities having found out their mistake, abolished the duty, but the abolition does not appear to have had the desired effect, as direct shipments from the Arab Coast continued on a larger scale in the year under review. Exchange. —The highest point reached in the Sterling exchange was krans 59J in February, and the lowest in October krans. Rupee exchange varied between 398J krans in February and 368J krans in October per RIOO. Bar silver to the value of R19,95,000 was imported through Bushire for despatch to the Imperial Mint at Tehran. Also krans 46,85,000 were sent up-country to the various branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Iramport—Ovf'mg to the abundant supply and cheap prices of fodder, mule hire from Bushire to Shiraz has not been so high as last year. The year opened with a quotation of krans 150 per 100 maunds of 775 Tbs. It dropped to 75 krans in February, but rose again to krans 130 in April. In the begin ning of May, mules were not available and the rates rose to as high a figure as krans 170, but were not maintained at this figure for a long time. In June the rates dropped to 85 krans and touched the lowest at 65 krans in December. It is said that the cessation in forwarding of telegraph stores up-country relieved the pressure on transport and consequently the rates fell. Freights. —The three British lines of steamers plying in the Persian Gulf having formed a combine, the freights which had fallen so low as 14 shillings in the previous year, rose to 25 shillings in the beginning of the year, and con tinued steady during the first seven months, when they dropped to 20 shillings for a short time rising at the end of the year to 27s. Qd. It is said that freights have been fairly remunerative throughout the year, and if the combine con^ tinues, will pay all the three lines in the end. Freights to India are charged according to different articles, such as general cargo at R10 per ton scale, skin and leather R25, dates in baskets R12, rosewater in cases R1 each, in carboys annas 8 each, and horses fi35 each.

The total value of trade for the year according to the figures furnished bv His Highness the Sultan's Customs Superintendent, is returned at 6 390 420 dollars as against 5,711,950 dollars of the last year, showing an increase of 678,470 dollars. This amount represents an increment of $675,145 on the import side and $3,325 on the export. The imports exceed the exports by 1,371,100 dollars, and it would appear, therefore, that the balance of trade is against the country to this extent. This, however, is not the case, for owing to its geographical position and facility for call of steamers from Europe, Maskat serves as a port of entry for certain poods such as arms and ammunition, sugar, and piece goods, which are again exported to the Persian Gulf ports and about 30 per cent, of the sugar imported is despatched to Cutch and Kathiawar ia India. The Customs authorities keep no record of this re-exportation, there being no duty leviable in it, and the figures given in the Return are consequently only approximate to the real exports of the country. The last year's Return showed an increase over that of the previous year of $208,747 on the import side ; and this year's imports again give an increase over the last year's of |675,145 or 21 per cent.

P ART VI.— TRADE REPOUT OE BUNDER ABBAS FOR THE YEAR 1903. , .. year 1903 has been a good one for Bunder Abbas. There was a General better rainiall, ana consequently the condition of the people improved. This has Remarks - reacted on the imports which show a marked improvement. The imports for 1903 amount to £449,145 against £399,291 last year, and an average of £430,991 for uhe past five years. The exports have increased also, owin 0, princi pally to the abolition of export duty on the principal commodities. The exports for 1903 amount to £138,632 against £97,331 in 1902, and £148 499 average export for the past five years. Great Britain and India supply 72 per cent, of the imports and 58 per cent, of the exports of the port. The substitution of a complicated tariff by weight in lieu of the old 5 per cent, ad valorem tariff does not seem to have affected the trade of this port till towards the end of the year under review, when trade became very depressed. 2. The opening for export of sulphur suggested in last year's report seems Openings for impracticable; the mines are farmed as a monopoly and are some distance from ;British Tee the coast, the cost of carriage is great, consequently the rates for shipping the sulphur are prohibitive. There should be an opening for direct trade in Kerman carpets via Bunder Abbas to England. There is a considerable export of raw cotton and wool, almonds, raisins, and asafoetida from this port. All these articles are free from export duty under the new tariff, and British Indian merchants might, perhaps, turn their atten tion to developing this trade with advantage, whenever the Indian market seems favourable for these commodities. 3. Bunder Abbas is primarily the port of entry for goods for Kerman, Mistakes of Yezd, and Central and Eastern Persia. Caravans also proceed to Seistan and British Meshed. There is practically no local market, so that merchants trading with thSr^ore^gn^ this port should study the markets of Central Persia and the Consular reports Competitors, from Yezd and Kerman to ascertain their mistakes, if any, and what articles are in demand. 4. The import of tea from Java appears to be steadily increasing. The Progress of reason for this increase is not clear, but as any such increase must be at the T rade. expense of Indian and Ceylon tea, Indian tea merchants might well look into the matter. A considerable quantity of the Java tea is white tea,*' which is preferred to black tea by the better class Persians.^ Eour steamers of the newly established Russian line from Odessa to the Persian Gulf Ports called at Bunder Abbas during the year and brought a considerable quantity of petroleum and sugar to this port. The sugar is cheap but of poor quality and is not appreciated by the people, who prefer Erench sugar. Russian kerosine seems to have always been used in the Persian Gulf, but was previously brought in British vessels. 5. The arrangements for landing cargoes are still very unsatisfactory. Difficulties in Thefts from lighters are frequent; the customs pier and godowns offer very ^® d ^ ay of poor facilities for landing and storing goods, and finally the charges for landing, carriage, and storage are very high. The security of goods after receipt by the Agents of the Customs Department has greatly improved during the past year, and it may be hoped that cheaper and better arrangements for landing and storing goods will shortly be made by the Customs Department, as the matter is under consideration. Sugar, grain, flour, etc., in sacks are the commodities principally stolen from lighters, A considerable quantity may be removed without any chance of detection by piercing the sack with a fine-pointed scoop. Some form of cheap bag which reduces the possibilities of this method may, perhaps, be on the market; if so, it would seem advisable to use such bags for shipments to the Persian Gulf. 5354 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL with Traders.

An extension of the land line from Jask to Bunder Abbas would be a great boon to the port. Communication 6. The Vice-Consul is ready to place British merchants in communication with local traders, or to give them any information in his power (subject to tiie general rules) on receipt of any enquiry. 7. On the 14th February 1903 a new tariff was introduced by which im- port duties were in the main increased and export duties reduced &gt; The import duties on wine and spirits, tea and indigo, and the export duty on opium were very largely increased. Import of indigo was greatly reducpd during the last year. The import of tea and export of opium, however, do not seem to have been affected until the new Tariff had been in operation about six months. Trade in both commodities was very brisk at the beginning of the year, but fell off greatly at the end of the year. During the first two months of this (l904i) year trade in tea and opium has been practically at a standstill. Merchants trading with Persia have doubtless studied the new Tariff Regulations, and noticed that with few exceptions the new duties are charged by weight and that such weights include the weight of all wrappings, boxes, bottles, barrels, etc., which according to ordinary trade custom change hands when the commodities are bought and sold. Merchants have doubtless taken steps to reduce any unnecessary weight in all coverings which are usually sold with the commodity. To facilitate passage of goods through Customs it would seem advisable that merchants and shippers should take steps to have the weight with wrap pings marked on piece goods, etc., and to show the weight of goods as well as value in invoices. * 8. Means of communication are very bad. The roads to Kerman and Yezd are by no means safe, though robberies were less frequent in 1903 than in for mer years. The Persian Government Post was robbed once or twice during the year, rates for carriage were comparatively low during the year. The rate to *£5-15 to £7-13 Yezd varied from 30 * to 40 tomans per 100 Yezd maunds, that is about 1,400 lbs. t £3-1 to £3-9 ^ 10 ra ^ e ^ errn an varied between 161 to , , 18 tomans per 100 Tabriz maunds of 7 lbs. each, about 700 lbs. At the date of writing (March 1904) rates to Kerman and Yezd are 8 and o tomans, very low owing to no merchandize having arrived here lately. 9. Exchange here is mostly with India, and rupees are in common circula- lon. Sovereigns are rarely seen. Exchange varied from krans 3J to krans s per rupee. In the annexed tables exchange is taken at 3i krans per rupee equal to 52} krans per sovereign. 10. The shipping table annexed shows the increase in tonnage of British shipping during the past year. In addition to the Steam Ship Companies men tioned in last year's report, the West Hartlepool Company has established a sen ice of steamers from England to the Gulf, which call occasionally at this port. Freights from Bunder Abbas to London have varied from 25 shillings per ton or gum, etc., to 36-6 per ton for carpets and valuable articles. Freights rom Bombay to Bunder Abbas from E10 per ton to 1112 per ton. A. P. TEEVOR, His Britannic Majesty's Vicp-Constd, Bun'ler Ahhas. Communica tions. Exchange. irticH 0oi«« ' Otbrt K*' Otbaicrt!

The trade of the Bahrein Islands has made a pronounced upward move ment during the past year and shows an increase of over forty lakhs of rune ' on that for 1902. The exports having risen by R 19,27,210 and the imports by R20,92,850. The improved condition of the inhabitants of Katraudthe decrease of lawlessness in the A1 Hassa District have contributed lar^elv towards this satisfactory result. 5 ^ Cotton textiles nearly regained their former condition. About 20 percent of the cotton piece goods imported are of Indian manufacture and 80 per cent of Manchester goods imported through Bombay firms. There is also an increase in yarns and twists. About 70 per cent, of the quantity are 6 S of Indian make imported for the manufacture of sail-cloth or canvas and the balance is composed of 20 S. of Indian manufacture and 30 S. of Lancashire make for weaving into lungis, dhotis, and bed sheeting for native use. Rice was also imported in larger quantities. The stocks of rice held at the close of the year were below the average quantity usually on hand at such seasons, and consequently it ought, in the absence of disturbing conditions to show a further improvement in the future. 5 The transactions in coffee show a decline which ought not to have been the case. In the latter half of the year importers failed to arrange for the arrival of the bean in time to take advantage of the demand obtaining at the termination of the pearling season, as well as in the month prior to the Muham- madan fast when large purchases are made for the A1 Hassa and Katr markets A large stock was found on hand on the 31st December owing to late shipments from Europe. Better results are expected in the current year. T' 1 . 6 manufacture of lanterns out of sheet glass and tin plate by Persians settled in this country within tie past two years has affected detrimenta!lv the importation of lamps and lampware. The trade in sheet-glass, however, benefited by it. o » j The Bahrein pearl banks proved less productive. The high prices paid bv the dealers for the pearls made up the difference to the divers. The Katr hankswere, however more prolific and are said to have produced about 40 per cent, more pearls than the preceding season.
