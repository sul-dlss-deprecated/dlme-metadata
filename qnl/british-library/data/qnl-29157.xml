D.O.No, 780-3 of 1931. 7-% British Hesidency, Bushire, the Blst hovember 1931. ifly dear Howell, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with Government of India telegram No. 1235-N of 8th November 1931. As you will see from my endorsement No. 771-3 of 20th November, I have had to modify my tour programme. I originally intended starting from iionammerah and working down the Gulf, but as tne '(Jhakla ^ has to come from Calcutta I cannot now leave till the 29th November, and this would have made me ratner late reacning the Trucial coast and would have been inconvenient both to the Air Officer Commanding, who is accompanying me, and to the Senior Naval Officer. I am therefore proceeding direct to the Trucial coast and on to Auscat and Sur, and then up tne Persian coast and back to Bushire. as you will see I go to M©hammerah between Christmas and tne New Year and Bahrain about the 3rd January. xhere I can let the *Chakla H go and return to Bushire either by the slow mail or in a sloop, as she has to be back in Bombay on the 13th January. Actually this programme fits in also better with my personal arrangements, as it enacles me to spend 2 or 3 days at Bushire for Christmas and tor the New Year. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H. V. Biscoe. E. B. Howell, Esquire, C.S.I., Eoreign Secretary to the Government oi India, New uelhi.{w-i Your telegram of the 8th October No.2502 to Secretary of State for India. Gould you kindly let me know when Chakla will be available. It would be convenient if I could have her about 20th November since this will suit Air Officer Commanding and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf who will accompany me. Telegram No.567, dated the 5th November 1931. From - Resident, Bushire, To - Foreign, New Delhi. My telegram No. 548, October 27th and your letter of 26th October No.F.8-N/31. Following is tour programme. Moharamerah 2 days, if quarantine permit. Kuwait 1 day. Bahrain 4 days, ^atar and Trucial coast 10 days. Batinah coast 2 days. Muscat 4 days. Probably (group mutilated) 2 days. Bandar Abbas and Henjam one day each. Returns but time spent in getting from one port to another totals about 32 days. But this may have to be curtailed if the ship comes from Calcutta as voyage from Calcutta to Bushire and back to Bombay would presumably take about 28 days and ship would also have to go to Basra to coal. Jt is important that I should proceed at early date as Muscat affairs and arrangements for air route on Trucial coast should be settled as soon as possible. Moreover later in the year landing on the Trucial coast is often difficult and for several days communication with shore may be impossible. I should be glad to know if British India Steam Navigation Company will provide launch on 'Chakla H for going ashore, as at many places in the Gulf ships anchor many miles out.

In the early part of this year he had an attack of what j is thought to have been false angina, which necessitated his taking leave earlier than he might otherwise have done. He has been in the Gulf since November 1929, practically without a break save for a short visit to India on duty and a couple of days’ recess at Shiraz. In the circumstances we need take no exception to the application. But it will be necessary to secure the concurrence in his leave of both the Foreign Office and Colonial Office. I have sent a preliminary letter to them, of which copies are below. Q The present Political Agent at Muscat, Major Fowle, has an unusual record of service in Persia and Arabia, and was a definite success from the Colonial Office standpoint, as well as our own, at Aden. Details of his previous service are given in the demi-official letters to the Foreign Office and Colonial Office, of which copies are attached. He seems, in the circumstances, an entirely suitable choice. 3. The onrJ-y alternative is Lt.Col. H.R.P.Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait , whose experience is more specialised and who not a permanent member of the Department. It may be assumed that the Resident has carefully considered, in consultation with the Governmen of India, the arguments for and against his present selection, and we need not, I think, take $ny exception to it. Postings are primarily a matter for the Government of India and we should not interfere unless there special reasons, C, GU ^ ^ Usul.
