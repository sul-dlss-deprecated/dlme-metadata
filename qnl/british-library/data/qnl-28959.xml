They include ten mining engineers, one oil geologist, one hydro-electrical engineer and one railway engineer. The Embassy state that your Polish colleague has already approached you about the possibility of employing these men and have asked for our support. 2. The Embassy have also asked us to consider whether employment could be found in Persia for a number of Polish railway engineers, formerly employed by the Polish State Railways, who are at present in Russia. We have replied that the services of these experts may be very useful and have asked the E-mbassy to prepare lists of the men concerned. 3. Railway engineers and technicians seem more likely to be useful than mining engineers at the manent, but you will no doubt consult with your Polish colleague as to the best means of making use of any of these technicians who may be suitable for work connected with the railways or roads.

I am replying to your letter to Crosthwaite of the 19th August (Ext.4840/41) about the possibility of certain Polish engineers being employed either in Afghanistan or Persia. If - as is by no means impossible - the Afghan Government should decide that recent events in Persia make it desirable for them to reduce the German colony in Afghanistan, some of these men might take the places of any German engineers who may be expelled. As regards Persia, there may also be openings for Polish engineers to replace the Germans who, we hope, will be expelled in the very near future. Meanwhile /we E.W.R.
