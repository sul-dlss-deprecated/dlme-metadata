Ho. , Sir, ADEN. 16th March, 1932* I have the honour to refer to Lord Pasafield’s Confidential despatch dated the 18th August 1931, and to state that I have for some time been 'giving consideration to the intended substitution of a single comprehensive treaty for the six existing treaties with individual Chiefs of the Upper Yafa* tribe. 2* This proposal originated with Sir Stewart Symes, who desired thereby to counteract the centrifugal tendencies of this tribe which is ethnically a single unit. hen he broached the subject to the Upper YaxaJ* Chiefs they appeared to be more concerned with the practical difficulties than with the principle of collective engage ment, and it was anticipated that they would accept the annulment of their individual treaties without much difficulty. 3* Since then their opposition to the change has hardened. In July 1931 they addressed a joint letter to the Protectorate Secretary in which they have expressed their unanimous dislike of it. I decided to take the opportunity of their presence at the L&amp;hej Conference to discuss the matter further with them, and at a meeting with them on 1st March 1932 I allowed them to explain their point of view fully. They urge that in all questions affecting the tribe as a whole, such as defence against a common enemy, they are in practice already united, but that in HIS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, LONDON.in internal matters they are by custom and tradition separate from each other with no single over-ruling authority to control their affairs. They contend therefore that their existing treaties with His Majesty 1 s Government are in conformity with their tribal practice, and that insistence on a form of unity which is at variance with it will breed internal difficulties and dissension. However divided they may be on matters of minor importance it is evident that on this question, which affects the tribe as a whole, they are entirely unanimous. 4. In considering this subject I am impressed by the views expressed by the Viceroy of India, which were communicated to Sir Stewart Symes in Lord Passfield’s secret despatch dated the 30th July 1930. His Excellency observed that the Government of India’s own experience led them to doubt whether cohesion could be forced upon tribes like the Ahl Yafa from without, except by a considerably greater measure of interference in their internal affairs than it would be convenient to exercise or could be obtained by subsidies only. In my opinion these doubts are justified, and I consider that a unitary treaty which is at variance with the traditional tribal system of the Upper Yafais will in practice be more inconvenient to work than the multiple treaties to which it is theoretically preferable. 5. I am opposed on principle to the annulment of tribal treaties except on very strong grounds. The treaties with the various Chiefs of the Protectorate are the basis on which the Aden Protectorate exists. These tre&lt;* ! -ies were made by mutual consent, and in my opinion they should not be abrogated except by mutual consent, unless one of the parties to them fails to observe their terms, or unless the circumstances in which they were made areare so altered that their continuance is clearly unnecessary or impossible* There are no such reasons in the case of Upper Yafa 1 , and the termination or modification of its treaties should therefore be a subject of agreement and not of compulsion* It is now evident that the alteration which has been proposed cannot be obtained by willing agreement. To force it on the Chiefs against their wishes will be difficult, and will raise apprehensions in the minds of other treaty Chiefs in the Protectorate. 6. In the circumstances the doubts as to the wisdom of proceeding with the revision of these treaties \ which I have entertained for some time have been converted into a definite conclusion that the disadvantages that it will entail are greater than the possible advantages I therefore recommend that the policy of His Majesty’s Grovernment with regard to this question be reconsidered, and that the existing treaties with the Upper Yafa* Chiefs be allowed to continue. 7. I have no fear that this change of policy will be regarded as an indication of weakness or vacillation on the part of His Majesty’s Government. '* On the contrary, I believe that it will be welcomed and appreciated not only by the Upper Yafais but also by the other Chiefs and tribes of the Protectorate who value their treaties with the British Government as the guarantee of their security and freedom.

Sultan Muhammad Salih of Upper Yafa. After compliments, We entertain good opinion of you and wish you prosperity since we have heard of your good behaviour and that of your people and their attachment to you. We are also aware of the attitude maintained by vour prodecessors towards the descendents of the Prophet. Your father Sultan Salih had gone to the Imam and was given his desire. He was also given the administration of Juban, Hubei ate in and other countries. Over and above this he achieved honour both in this and in the next world for having attached himself to the descendents of the Prophet, but after his return to Yafa he was (as God said) ’misled by Satan and made to forget the mention of God etc.’ and he went over to the enemy of Islam. You are aware that God said, ’he who agrees to their rulership, is considered to be one of them’. May God guide all of us to the proper path and cause you to adhere to the right, and its people, and to the acceptable way ? and to follow the descendents of the Prophet, and to avoid all that is degrading such as joining the infidels whose dealings both you and ourselves know, and attachment to whom is but unavailing repentance both in this and in the next world. We ward you not to adhere to any one other than i'^aster, the Amir of the Faithful. We also warn you’not to be unmindful, and not to hink that the Imam will neglect the Islamic countries because^Islam has the supremacy and nothing can surpass it. W© have written this to you because we have received authentic news that the Mutawakilite forces will proceed against all parts, and each force will be under the Command of one of the sons of the Imam, may God increase their number and save them. The people of Murad have tendered their submission as also Eani Dhabyan, Abide and all other Eastern parts. You must have heard of the Whatever documents or undertakings were given to him in the past, will be fulfilled on our responsibility, and we will see that he is given authority over Juban and ^obeistein, as also undertakings concerning A1 Had etc., at 0! i r x? iee ^ ln S&gt; which should be arranged before the rmvement of the forces. Hemember that your country extends from A1 Had, as far as the borders ofMupeis, the distance of some days journey. The first incidents will take place against your border, and against other parts of Yafa thereafter. the descendents of^the Prophet, the rulers of Islam, and our sufferings to which the Zaraniq have been put, until they wholly submitted.

Lord, I have the honour to refer to Your Lordship^ Secret despatch dated the 1st of December 1930 and to report that at Aden, on the 18th and 19th instants, I discussed with all treaty Chiefs of the Upper Yafa tribe the question of their future relation? with his Majesty’s Oovernment. 2, I informed them that their present treaties were considered unsatisfactory and out of date inasmuch as they did not provide for common action by signatory (sectional) Chiefs in respect of the conduct of external affairs of the tribe. His Majesty’s Government therefore had decided to rescind them but were willinp that they should remain in effect for a period of two years to permit of negotiations for their substitution by a single treaty. I explained to them the purport of the bilateral engagements in the draft attached which comprised the more important provisions of their present treaties, and said that an additional clause would be necessary to cancel these latter and also to provide for future revisions of the new treaty. 3. The Chiefs present, including two non-treaty Chiefs, asked for time to consider the matter and leave to return to their country whence they wo/uld send me their reply. Discussion with them was quite friendly. They asked for assurances that certain personal benefits nownow received by them would not eumnarily be withdrawn. They seemed to be concerned more with the practical enpa^ement. 4. I did not show the Chiefs the draft of the penultimate clause quoted in the enclosure with my despatch No. 75 of the 9th of April. From preliminary conversation with them at Lahej 1 inferred that provision for an early revision of the treaty would, in their present frame of mind, 8Uf r / r est lack of permanency - and so, from their standpoint, of security - in the new treaty arrangements. Mindful of this, and subject to Your Lordship’s consent, I propose to amend the draft of this clause as under:- ' 'The above treaty supersedes all previous treaties with individual Chiefs of the Upper Yafa tribe end shall have effect from this date. It shall remain in effect and shall not be liable to changer by either p' rtyfor a period of 5 years/and provided thajj.4a formal notice of an amendment snail have been made by the one to the other periods of five years each and subject to the same provision for foxa&amp;l notice before the ena of each period. difficulties than with the principle of a col ective party not less than 6 months before tne end of the i \ period.

The suggestion of the Secretary of State for Indip. thet the phrase 'maintenance of public security 1 * in paragraph 3 of the draft might intclve an undesirable commitment has force.

As Your Lordship is aware the insertion in Clause 1 of reference to these treaties was due to insistence by the Chiefs themselves. Its effect is to make their military co-operation with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Coloniest London. To2 . fi iJ His Majesty’s Government conditional on the mainuonance of the treaties but it does not affect tae obligation of inter-tribal co-operation which was the primary object of the Pact. A purpose of the new treaty with the Upper Yefa Chiefs is, by promoting tribal solidarity, the better to secure fulfilment o this primary object; and this as well as the obligation (not expressly mentioned of military co-operation are clearly implicit in the terms of the treaty. This will h f ve to be explained to those Upper :‘afa Chiefs (and others) who subscribed to the Pact and who will be required to become signatories of the treaty. As re ards (2) - the practical difficulties - I а. m fully alive to the need for cautious negotiation, the more so as, contrary to our hopes, the prospect of a satisfactory settlement with the Imam is still very uncertain. 5* The Air Council’s assumption that grants for the making of roads and landing grounds could be comprised with benefits promised by paragraphs of the second part of the treaty is correct in principle. I air, however, advised that the mountainous nature of the Upper Yafa territory precludes the liklihood of any landing ground being established there presently. б. I would ask that, if possible, Ypur Lordship’s final instructions reapeetinr* the draft of the proposed treaty might be communicated to me before the middle of December next when I have invited the principal Chiefs, signatories of the Pact, to meet me again at Lahej, I hope that most of theUpper Yaf© Chiefs will attend this - second - Conference and should like to take that opportunity of discussing with theis their future treaty relations. Unless I can ?arn them that their present individual treaties may be moribund they will certainly refuse to discuss a new treaty on the lines now proposed. This discussion alone may reveal whether their fear of the Imam can outweigh their objections to the proposals for a collective engagement and suppression of their stipends. 7, I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Foreign and Political department of the (/overnment of India. 1 have the honour to be, Lord, lour Lordship’s moat obedient, humble servant.

Considerable uneasiness has been felt here in the past on the first point taken P. 7J5/30 and the minutes on P. 3247), but Sir Stewart clear (compare paragraphs land 3) that he proposes to go slowly with the Yafa Chiefs; that the new Treaty is only to be concluded after cautious negotiation; and that he contemplates personal discussion on his return to Aden with as many as possible of the Chiefs concerned.

Apart from formal innovations, this draft would substitute a collective engagement by the Chiefs for their individual undertakings in the several existing treaties, and associates this engagement with the execution of inter-tribal obligations imposed by the Lahej Pact (see my despatch dated 10th April 1929 ). It abolishes payments of fixed stipends for general services. It defines the practice of 'gracious favour and protection' as meaning political support, military aid of native opposition to foreign aggression, and discretionary grants of money (for native services) for the maintenance of public security and communications. It indicates procedure for future amendment or abrogation of the treaty. 3 . I apprehend that several features of the new draft treaty - notably the a do lit ion of stipends to individuals - will not prove readily acceptable by the Chiefs, and need for cautious negotiation is imposed by the undesir . bility of giving an impression to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. v 8 S g? -4© to them and othors that we are about to repudiate all serious concern with their future welfare.

J \ In his despatch No. 14 of the 30th January, 1929 (P. 1859/29), Sir Stewart Syraes suggested that the time was ripe for the consideration by His Majesty’s Government of a constructive policy for the Aden Protectorate and our relations with its Chiefs. The line of action which he proposed is set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his despatch. The India Office - subject to the views of the Government of India - agreed that it was deserving of encouragement and that, pnma facie , the scheme outlined by the Resident was worth a trial. They remarked that Sir Stewart Symes would no doubt feel his way slowly, and that no question e.g. of determining the existing treaties of the Protectorate Rulers, or any of them, would arise until His Majesty's Government were satisfied that the policy suggested t definitely represented the right line on which to proceed. The Government of India expressed the view that the time was ripe for some degree of peaceful c penetration, and that their own experience encouraged the making of cautious experiment on the lines proposed by the Resident. In these circumstances, his recommendation was approved, and in the spring of 1929 he attended a conference at Lahej, at which the leaning Chiefs of the Protectorate were present to consider the future organisation of the territory tP. 3252/29). The proposals then made by him apparently met with a generally friendly reception, and an undertaking in general terms, subject to an assurance that signature would not eo facto invalidate their individual treaties with His Majesty’s Government, was signed by the Rulers. 3818a 5000 8/29 Sir/2. Sir Stewart Symes now recommends the adoption o the next stage in his policy, with a view to making it « clear to Chiefs and tribesmen that continuance of British protection, and its contingent benefits, will be dependent on their co-operation and compliance. The details of his proposal are set out in paragraphs 5. 2. 'This is an important step, but if it is to be taken, the circumstances appear to be as satisfactory as can be hoped for, and the Resident, before submitting his proposal, has made enquiry of the Sultan of Lahej and of the Sultan of Lower Yafa, with apparently satisfactory results. The question of policy is no longer one for us, but for the Colonial Office, who are prepared to approve the Resident's proposal. They are presumably satisfied that the general policy adumbrated in January of last year' has so far sufficiently proved itself, and on that assunption action on the lines now proposed would clearly be the next step. I submit that, in the circumstances, we may concur in their view, and that we need not consult the Government of India before doing so. It will be remembered that Colonel Reilly, with his great experience of the Aden hinterland, is still First Assistant at Aden (he is to act as Resident during the summer); he is, as we know, kept in close touch with the political side of th^ administration; and it may be assumed that, before making a move so important as this, the Resident would have fully aiscussed it with him. It is unlikely that India could contribute much of value to consideration of the problem. ^ A letter to the Colonial Office, concurring subject to the concurrence of the other Departments of his majesty’s Government, is submitted. u /o~c ^ Cor any further conun unication on this subjeat, please quote N °- tea*) S and address —noi to any person by nai/tr, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. com THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his piiments to and, by direction of tYie Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop££) of the under-mentioned paper.

I hare the honour to refer to ny deeoatch Ro. 14 dated the 30th January last, relating to nolicy in the Aden Protectorate, and to submit further observations on the conduct of its tribal affairs. They ara concerned principally withthe zone described in paragraph 3 of my despatch, as co/rtact*ith tribes men to the east and in the interior of the Hadhranaut is scarcely more than by an occasional exchange of letters or opportunity for conversation afforded by the chance visit of an individual to Aden. 2. Our relations with the tribes have been founded on the policy of no taxation and favour. Favour has been expressed in grants of stipends, presents of arms and money, and entertainment of supposedly influential persons to retain their goodwill. Native Home rule has been generally respected, and interference with it, even under strong provocation, the rare exception. By this system - if it may so be termed - has been preserved, and even accentuated, a native conception of independence that is not political, as we understand i , but rather one of voluntary subjection to a Government that demands no material service from its subjects nor puts restriction on their personal liberties. Our treaties pith T individual chiefs, which provide &gt;*»• constitutional basi s Lbasis of the 'system* realised t is conoeotion in so far as they conferred benefits of Protection etcetera in return for, in most cases, scarcely more than a friendly obligation on the ^art of a chief and his tribesmen, 3. The system has preserved a hinterland of tribes who are passively and, in places, actively well disposed to us, but it has failed to checJc and may ocoasioiMilly have favoured these disintegrating processes which are tha bane of all Arab Societies. In any case he territory o-day presents an illumi nating, if unedifying, example of exaggeration of the principle of personal liberty. Apart from the miniature native States of Lahej and r, akalla, few tribal units possess an effective organization for the conduct of relations with neighbouring units or »the Government* at Aden. With several exceptions rule by a paramount chief is nominal only, and the authority of subordinates is uncertain. Political, social and geographical conditions have led to multiplication of individual units and local authorities to a degree that gravely complicates the regulation, of inter-tribal affairs and renders combination between them for any purpose - even common defence - almost impossible. 4. This state of disintegration of a population primitive and armed with modern rifles, prevents the success of attempts, unless by compulsion, to maintain public security and improve communications: in fact, to carry out any measure for the general welfare. Any such attempts by us must reckon with the (cynical)(cynical) orinion that it is sometimes well to leare 111 alone, and also that a situation apt to a nolioy of diTide et iamera may hare its advantages. But this oninion ignores the contingencies of &amp; stronger Yemen and an eventual modus vlvendi between its Government and the Shafei majority beyond our borders, and the disturbing influence thataMftsr or both these contingencies would exeroise in our Protectorate. On the other hand, our assistance to achieve organic and other reforms should be made conditional on practical evidences of desire on the part of the tribes to withstand absorption with the Yemen and to improve their state. In other words, our policy being one of tribal affiliation and pacific relations, we must make clear to ohiefs and tribesmen hat continuance of our Protection and contingent benefits will be dependent on their co-operation and compliance. 5. I should like to exemplify this at an early date and for the purpose to select the Upper Yafa tribe, centrifugal tendencies in which are admittedly a source of tribal weakness and embarrass ment. In this tribe, that is ethnically, and oug it to be politically, a single unit, the paramount Sultan, who is a cipher, has beenacknovledged by us and we have separate treaties with him and five other influential chiefs of sections. I propose to notify these chiefs^that their treaties will be annulled within two years and that their replacement afterwards by a single instrument will be conditional on the existence of a single chief or council of ohiefsoMef* coo-'eteiit to ropresent the tribe and aeoure fulfilment of all obligation* under the LaheJ pact, to which the indiridual chief* have already subscribed (3ee ray desnatch o. 57 of 10th of April last). 6. I have made di acrest inquiry from, among others, the Sultans of Lahej and Lower Yafa as to the probable effect of a formal notification of this kind on the Upp^r Ya/a tribe and its neighbours, and am persuaded that it would be salutary. The evils resulting from lack of unitary organisations in the Protectorate are as apparent as is the difficulty of a remedy for them. External pressure and the introduction of a time limit are essential to reform in this rssosct* Both of these will be provided by the means 1 now advocate, and there is an advantage in selecting for this experimental treatment a tribe flanked by others in treaty relations with us who could, if necessary, close its lines of communications with Aden. Thers remains a risk that disturbance in the tribe resulting from dissensions among its 1 adsrs might lead to Zeidi penetraiion. This risk is inhersnt but, 1 think, may be taken. In existing circumstances ws can put little reliance on any organised co-operation by these tribesmen with air action. The same causes, reinforced by general dislike of the Zeidi s, would almost certainly prevent any general movement by the tribesmen in their favour. 7. I propose, subject to Your Lordship’s consent, to take a suitable opportunity to notify thethe Chiefs of the Urmer Yafa trihe in the sense of oaragraph 5, and in due course to submit for Your Lordshio’s approval the draft of a single instrument to replace the present treaties with then and to serve as a guide to other treaty revisions which may require to be made in pursuance of the policy suggested in paragraph 9 of my Secret despatch of the '30th of January last.

It was Sir S.Symes 1 ^ intention to take the opportunity of his meeting with the Chiefs at Lahej to make discreet enquiry as to the extent of co-operation in an elementary organization, primarily for defence against Zeidi aggression, that might he expected, and also as to the federal system which might be evolved in the near future. Actually he had been able to go considerably further, and a Pact was signed by the Chiefs present at the meeting on 6 April. By this Pact the Chiefs agree to confer with each other (and with such other Chiefs as.join the conference), in respect of co-operation with E.M.G. in defence, the safeguarding and improvement of communications, settlement of disputes by arbitration, and other matters of mutual interest; it is provided that existing treaties between the Chiefs and H.M.G. are maintained. Arrangements were discussed for co-operation Si**]*'*’ in a frontier defence scheme and also for arbitration by the Sultan of Lahej in certain inter-tribal disputes. Though Sir S.Symes was able to make greater progress than he had apparently contemplated, the Pact, by which the Chiefs agree to meet each other in conference on certain matters, does not go beyond the stage of cautious experiment in the direction of developing a native organisation which in favourable conditions might evolve into some form of federal system. The C.O. have informed the Resident of their appreciation of his action, and propose to circulate u /28 the correspondence with a brief covering memorandum -2to the Cabinet, This proposal is made subject to any observations which the Secretary of State for India may have to offer.

Sir, 1 have the honour to report that, at rny suggestion, the Sultan of Lahej issued invitation? to a number of the leading chiefs of this Protectorate to assemble and confer at Lahej between the 1st and 7th instants, his igchness's invitation was accepted by the following:- The Upper Yafa Sultan and his father. The Naoibs of the Mausatta, and the Hadhrami, Dhubi and I uflahi Sheikhs, all of Upper Yafa. Th® Lower Yafai Sultan. The Fadhli Sultan. The Haushabi Sultan. The Amir of Dhala. The Lower Aulaqi Sultan. The Qotaibi Shiekh. The Alawi Sheikh. 2 . I opened the conference ceremoniously at the Sultan’s Palace on the morning of the 1st instant, and represented to the assembled chiefs the need for unity and co-operation between them in order to withstand \ Zeidi penetration and for the better organization of the territory, I said that the degree of assistance they could expect in the future would depend on evidences of their desire and capacity to make a good use of the independence which was secured to them by the His Majesty’ g Secretary of State for the Colonies,the Protection of His Majeaty 1 * Government, and suggested the desirability of a formal statement of their good intentions. The matter was subseouently discussed by the chiefs among themselves and also at a further meeting vith at which 1 was asked for • and &lt;*ave - assurance that their signature of a pact or statement o** this kind would not eo facto invalidate their individual treaties with His ^taie8ty , s Government. Agree ent on the principle and formula was reached eventually, ■-iiid a pact - of which the English version is attached - was eigned by each chief in ray presence on the afternoon of the 6th instant. 3. Opportunities were taKen during the week to discuss with the chiefs arrangements for their co operation, collectively and individually, in a simple frentier defence scheme, and also for arbitration by the Sultan of Lahej in respect of certain inter-tribal disputes which have prevented peaceful development of cultivable lands in the Abian region between the Yafa and Fadhli tribal districts. 4. Proceed in *s were generally harmonious, and the assembly, besides promoting a better understanding between individual chiefs, has I think led to a clearer realisation by them that existing treaties involve obligations as well as benefits, and that cohesion between the tribes is a common interest. 7 Jr The presence of Lahej of a number of the Subeihi chiefs who lately submitted, but who were excluded from the meetings and social gatherings, afforded mute but tangible evidence of the ability of Government in case of need to assert authority by other means than arguments.5, The arranwmentB made by the Sultan of Lahej for conference and hospitality were excellent and His ,T i^iness f B personal ascendency with his fellow chiefs was shown on several occasions, I have, &amp;c, # (Suyied! 0.

POLITICAL This is an important despatch containing Sir Stewart Symes’s proposals on the policy to be pursued by His Majesty's Government in the Aden Protectorate. It is also urgent, as the Resident is anxious (paragraph 10 of his despatch) to convoke a meeting of as many as possible of the leading Chiefs in the latter half of March, when, if the general line of his proposals is approved by His Majesty's Government, an opportunity would be afforded for a general discussion of Protectorate affairs and for discreet enquiry as to the attitude which the Protectorate Rulers would be outlined by him. It has been recognised for some time past that careful consideration would sooner or later be called for of the future policy of His Majesty's Government in relation to the Protectorate Rulers. The most definite recent proposals on the subject are those contained in the memorandum enclosed in Sir Gilbert Clayton's letter of 6th April, 1926, printed on pages 56-60 of the Colonial Office print flagged 'C below. In connection with those proposals there should be read the Air Ministry letter to the Colonial Office of 22nd January on P. 945, and the covering despatch from the Colonial Office of 31st January on the same paper transmitting it to the Resident at Aden. We may, I think, agree with Sir Stewart Symes as to the alternative courses open to His Majesty's Government. These are, in his view, - (a) to leave matters as they are; likely to adopt towards a policy such as is now (b)/a: (b) the renunciation of our protectorate over the greater part of the protected area, the inhabitants being left to the mercy of the Imam; (c) a simple form of direct administration of the Protectorate, or of such parts in the vicinity of Aden as will be required for the protection from sudden attack of the base and Settlement; (d) his present proposal - a solution along native and - as there is no local family which possesses attributes of sovereignly - federal lines... Sir Stewart Symes contemplates the possibility of constituting eventually in the Protectorate one or more Chiefs’ Councils on the lines of the Tribal Councils in Baluchistan, to be the central authority for the settlement by arbitration and otherwise tribal affairs, and to become the principal and indigenous instruments of our political direction. The Sultan of Lahej v/ould be a possible Chairman. One effect of this policy, if it could be successfully introduced, would be the revision of our treaty position in relation to the Protectorate Rulers (see — paragraph 9). ^ (a) is far from satisfactory, and, as Sir Stewart Symes points out, the present moment, when we have driven the Imam out of the Protectorate (and when, incidentally, a change of higher control has taken place at Aden), is a favourable one in which to introduce any new policy which may be considered ■ necessary. r. To (b) and (c) the objections stated in paragraph 7 of the Resident’s despatch are, I think, conclusive. The policy suggested in (d) and examined in detail in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the despatch, is a definite departure from anything which has been contemplated/Paper. POLITICAL Department. contemplated in the past. But prima facie it is, I think, well worth the trial which the Colonial Office suggest that it might now be given, ajid in considering it it should be remembered that Colonel Reilly, who has very great experience of the Protectorate and of Aden problems generally, is now again at Aden as First Assistant, and that it is very probably he, rather than Sir Stewart Symes, who is the originator of the proposals (compare reference to Baluchistan - Sir Stewart Symes has no experience of India). It remains to be seen whether the policy would be a success, but it would presumably be introduced gradually, and there would be no question, at any rate until its success was beyond question, of determining our treaty engagements with the various Protectorate tribes. The objections to anything which would expose us to a charge of bad faith or of abandoning our proteges when they had ceased to be of immediate value to us, are patent. I submit, in the circumstances, that we might write to the Colonial Office as in the draft now put forward. P. in *7 2871 5000 0.28Draft Paper. POLITICAL Department.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^ * (3b. -1853 The Residency Aden 30th January, 1929 Sir i nay9 the honour to eutaiit that the tiae is ripe for consideration by Hie Majesty** Government of a constructive policy for the Aden Protectorate and our relations with its Chiefs. That the problem is, essentially, more an Imperial and Arab than an Indian concern has been recognised by transfer of control of Protectorate affairs to the Colonial Office. Nevertheless the existence of the Protectorate has hitherto been regarded as essential to the security of Aden Settlement which remains legally a part of British India and administratively under the Bombay Presidency. Where Imperial and Indian interests are so closely interwoven, and not always identical, as at Aden, X have apprehended that their proper reconciliation may be complicated if, at a future data, tae Provincial (Bombay) Cover ament were to be given a largely increased measure of autonomy. With this contingency in mind and also for administrative 1 convenience 1 have suggested to toe Government of India the desirability of making the Aden Settlement \ a local Government with a separate budget, and dependent from the Central Government at Delhi. 2. In any case while Aden retains importance as a fuelling base md port of transit - an^ 1Immediate raaeon for its decline - ite eecurity from attack by land and relatione with tna interior are matters of vital concern. Tde puxposee for mulch the Protectorate wae instituted were:* (1) To interpose a barrier, or neutral sone of friendly tribes between tne Yemen and Aden Settlement* (2) A point d’appui for commercial ana otner relations witn soutn-weet Arabia* (5) An ineurance against occupation by a koreign power of ports or coastal tracts near tne main line of our marina communications. 3. Before considering the extent to wnich tne so purposes are being, or are still required to bs, acnisved it will be relevant to describe vary briefly tne origin and circumstances of tae existing Protectorate system* in 1728, tne Governor of Lahej - of tne fibafei eeot * tnrew off all allegiance to tne Zeldi imamate in tne Yemen, seized Aden and became independent in alliance with tne noignbourlng (Snafei) tribes* In 1839, wnen tne Britisn occupied Aden, a treaty mad t wl tn the Abdali Sultan o f Xahej stipulated that uis Majesty's Government should pay tne stipends previously made by tne Sultan to the ladhli, Yafai, Hauehabi and Amiri tribal chiefs in order to secure their cood-will. Tnis was tne beginning of the system of treaties wnich has provided the fabric of our Protectorato. Subsequently, some 30 separate treaties were made with local cniefs whereby,(0 whereby, in return for *graciou« favour and prot•ction ,, and a fixed etipend, a cnief engaged neither to have relatione wi tn nor to alienate territory to a foreign Power* Pi re of theee treatise impose the further obligation on a chief to protect trade routes in hie territory. more immediately felt may be said to be comprised by a semi^cirole having a radius of about eighty miles with the Aden peninsula for its centre, in thie zone are included the territorial districts of tne tribes and tribal groups quoted in the previous paragraph. Beyond the zona to the east mid in the Hadramaut, but especially on the sea ooast* Or eat Britain was regarded as a kind of paramount power wuicn while recognizing dome rule yet was ready to prevent alienation of territory to foreign nations and inter tribal disputes wiicn threatened the public peace and commerce* The district of Behan, one of mose chiefs is in treaty relations wi tn us, is isolated to the north-east of the zone. lokotra Island is 300 miles distant by sea from Aden. Protectorate was rarely exerted by force* Usually we relied on grants of stipends and presents of arms and money to tna more authoritative chiefs to promote our occasional interventions on behalf of public security and neighbourly relations. Our practice in this The zone within w dch British iniluence was 4. Prior to tne war British influence in the / respect at times came near to indiscriminate buying off© off potential public nuisances* as witness a list of annual *presents and entertainment' received hy 100 beads of families in the small but troublesome Subehi tribe, flavortheless treaty relatione with the chiefs were maintained and the boundary of our Protectorate as delineated with the Turke in 1904 was kept inviolate until the war when the Turks over ran the greater p*rt of tne zona referred to above* 2*idi soldiers of tne Imm who occupied a lesser part afterwards were ejected mainly Air operations last July. 5. In either a geographical or an ethnological sense the Protectorate is an artificial institution. Its boundary wi th the Ysmen follows minor tribal divisions and separates a minority of the 3hafel • a 'Sunni-ssot of Islam from tae majority of their fellows who pay unwilling allegiance to tae held!

Me have thus been required to deal with the problems of a congeries of tribes and sub-tribes, several uncertain tribal confederations, and of two districts only - tne Sultanates of Lahej and Mokalla (iiadramaut}IttAdraamut) - which prosont the eemblaoce of an orderly natiro J5tate* The tribewcen for tae jaoet part are wild t intensely conservative and used to modern firearms* The authority exercised by their chiefs is local and often precarious* &amp;ven a British officer travelling on duty has usually to obtain permission to enter a tribal territory and is expected to make presents in cash for the most trifling assistance he may receive* In these circumstances trie continuance of a policy of aloof indifference diluted with bribes will be difficult* and the success of our endeavours by diplomacy and* on occasion* Air force to ensure quiet - if no progress or trade development • in our Protectorate seems very problematical* It is* 1 consider* essential to decide on our future policy and to begin its execution at a time when* by the tardy fulfilment of our treaty obligation of protection* our prestige is higher than it was and other local circumstances are not unfavourable* 7. A possible policy* in view of tne growth of the Arab National Movement and the emergence of an independen t Yemen State* would be to renounce our Protectorate over the greater part of tne territory and leave the inhabitants to the - not very tender - mercy of the 2eidi ruler* however satisfactory the effect on our immediate relations with the Imam* the inevitable consequence of this would be to make enemies of tribesmen who are now passively our friends and to leave them to a government which is 1 think incapable* so far away from its centre, of preventing their enmity finding constant expression in interferenoe with trading caravans and other aggressive acts against ue*A more eerioue objection is tmt it would be a flagrant violation of our treaty engagements with the chiefs and prejudicial to our good name and prestige in 3*W. Arabia. Similar objections can be urged against ary considerable modification of the present boundary with the Yemen, Another possible course would be to introduce a simple form of direct administration of the Protectorate or of such parts in the vicinity of Aden as may be required for tne protection from sudden attack of the Air baee and settlement. 1 feel aure that this would impair, if it did not altogether destroy, two of tna sore solid bases of our Protectorate system, vis: dome rule and no taxation. J It would certainly prove costly in view of tne unproductive nature of the country, and troublesome on account of the unruly character of the inhabitants. 1 do not recommend it. ! 8. uy view of the situation is briefly this. If we are to remain securely at Aden as o f right and not on sufferance by an Arab ruler, a friendly / hinterland in which our political Influence will be paramount is necessary. The Pro tectorate comprises all * perhaps more than - the hinterland required and provided it could be given a suitable political system f would adequately fulfil the three purposes quoted in paragraph 2 of this despatch. If we decide to maintaiit our Pro tectorate, the main problem will be now to promote such coheeion amon^ the tribes as will enable them, with such assistance as we can afford, to present a common front against Soldi agression and for the betterhotter orgaaloaUwA of tho territory. The solution of taxs problem must, 1 think, bo eougnt along natire and, as there is no local family wuicn poeeeesee attributes of sorereignty, federal linos. Its approach is bound to bo slow, but can be facilitated by a policy of giYing consistent support to those paramount chiefs who, in our or inion, are necessary for the proper ordering of tho tribes, and by encouraging tnem to enter into closer relations witn each other and with us. By these relations may be cultirated the sense of common interest and spirit of mutual confidence snioh could provide the basis for more regular and effective co-operation. It is note worthy that in Baluchistan, where local conditions are not very dissimilar, tne metnod of government by Jirrau or tribal councils, has given good results; and 1 conceive that it may be possible eventually to constitute in this Protectorate one or more Chiefs' councils to be tne central authority for the settlement by arbitration and otherwise of tribal aifairs and to become the principal - and native - instrument of our political direction. tfe have a valuable agent for the promotion of such a policy in the present Sultan of Lahej who by ais hereditary position, personal quail ties and proven loyalty is well fitted to preside, as primus inter pares , over any Council that may be assembled. 1 think tnat the consummation of a policy of this kind would not necessarily preclude, and might even increase, toe likelihood of a future amicable settlement of the frontier and other questions now at issue between us and the Imam of the Yemen.9. The off act of tuo Policy on our treaty arrangement# would raquiro coniiideration. Ciroum- etancea hare changed since the treaties wore made. But it was felt tnat revision of them could not be undertaken while Turks and Zeidis were in occupation of tribal lands and also that coneideratione other than mere expediency enould not be ignored. We have for our own purposes encouraged political separation of those tribes from the Yemen and it would not be right to withdraw our protection without first giving them an opportunity to organise for the maintenance of tne independent status they profess to desire but, in many instances, have done little to ensue. If, however, tribal chiefs could successfully combine to form a native organ for the control oi Protectorate affairs a single treaty imposing a collective guarantee might replace the present separate engagements. If not, we should consider ourselves free, after due notice had been ^dven, to annul or amend the existing treaties in accordance with our needs, It is probable that knowledge of our intention in this respect would be a further incentive to tne chiefs to become amenable to our policy ana requirements of tnem. 10. 1 intend in tim latter half of l f arch to convoke a meeting of as many ue possible of the leading chiefe in order to make their acquaintance &amp;nu confer with them collectively as to tribal dispositions for defence of the territory against any renewal of aggression from the Yemen. This meeting, which would+ j, be almoet the first of its kind, will probably take place at Lahej and would provide a suitable occasion to discuss Protectorate affairs in general and to make discreet inquiry as to the extent of co-operation in an elementary organisation hat may be expected from individual chiefs, and also as to tne federal system which might be evolved in the near future. Before 1 embark on an inquiry of tuis sort i should be grateful to receive, if possible by +- telegraph, your sanction and general observations on the tentative policy for the retention of the Protectorate and a better organisation of the territory wnich i have outlined in this despatch.

Sir, I am oonaandacl by the Air Counoil to inform you that they hare had under ooneideration your letter of Deoember 6th (59318/28) enolosing a copy of a letter addressed to the foreign Office and India Office on the prooedure to be followed as regards the recognition of new Chiefs upon their succession; also your letter of December 10th (59307/28) forwarding a copy of desoatoh 80.204 dated November 1st 1928, from the Resident at Aden, which conveyed the substance of an answer given by him to 3heikh Ahmed ?atini in reasons© to an appeal for assistance against the Imam. The Air Council have no observations to offer upon the action taken or proposed in the above letters, but they desire to lay before Mr. Secretary Amery certain considerations touching the general attitude of His Majesty’s Government in its relationships with the minor chiefs in the Aden Protectorate and the sphere of influence beyond it. These considerations are primarily political, but they h*sv© direct bearing upon THE UN91R B^CRSTART 0? STATS , COLONIAL OmOB, 8.1.1.upon our military ooramitraants* The Air Oouncil^ view is tJaat in general it is desirable to avoid, so far as possible, entering n sup-nort or recognition for them is deemed to he advantageous, it is preferable that it should be afforded not by subsidies as such, but by payments for services to be rendered in. the way of maintaining emergency landing grounds or keeping roads in repair* The amount of work thereby imposed on the chiefs would be small, and to the ohiefs themselves the immediate effect would be much the same as the payment of a subsidy based on a specific treaty relationship. From the point of view, however, of His Majesty’s Government, the arrangement would, it ia suggested, have the advantage of minimising the obligations of His Majesty's Government to support a particular chief if, owing to external aggression or other causes, hs became unable to carry out his part of the undertaking, and of avoiding the implication which has sometimes arisen that the honour of His Majesty's Government is engaged to protect any minor ruler to whom a treaty has been extended at some p&amp;sttime. The Air Council suggest that the adoption of this policy whenever practicable is in general more consistent with that 'fluidity* of political groupings in South Western Arabia which the Colonial Office consider to be endemic to conditions in that area (vide paragraph 13 of C.l.B, Memorandum 748-B, October 1926), The Air Council's suggestion is, in short, treaty relationships with these chiefs, and thatr\ J:k u n 0- -(mu- that so far as possible any new engagenents with ohiefs should be on the basis of the third category of those set out in C.P, 231(27) (Aden Hinterland: Obligations to Tribes) where the stipend ia granted T in exchange for the protection of trade routes and not on the basis of the first and second categories which provided for treaties of peace and friendship.

I appreciate that for budgetary reasons it may not be expedient to incur expense on this present but I should like to amplify the information contained in my telegram No.290 of the 10th October 1928, in order to explain the considerations on which my recommendation was based. It may be said, not only of the Abdali, but of all those tribes who helped us during the recent operations that they did so in their own interests; but while the support afforded by other chiefs in the Officer in the field, that given by the Sultan of Lahej was spontaneous and proved to be the keystone of the tribal movement, that, consequent on air action, -Apart from the as si stance he rendered on this occasion the present Sultan of Lahej has qualities of loyalty and statesmanship which have made him a successful arbitrator and a reliable intermediary for the settlement of inter-tribal di ffi culti e s.

Sir, I have the honour to submit this my report on my Mission to the Imam Yahya of the Yemen at San'a. Introductory. 2 . Having satisfactorily concluded my conversations with King Faisal and the ‘Iraq Government on the subject of the Agreement* concluded with Sultan ‘Abdu’l-‘Aziz ibn Sa‘ud with regard to frontier questions between ‘Iraq and Nejd, I left Baghdad by rail on the 4th December, 1925, arriving at Basra the next morning and embarking on the same day on the British India Company s s.s. “ Varela ” for Bombay. I was accompanied by Mr. George Antonius, for whose appointment as Secretary to the^ Mission your approval and the concurrence of the High Commissioner for Palestine had been received. Arrival in Bombay. 3. We reached Bombay on the 12th December, and I imme diately visited the Political Secretary to the Government of Bom bay—Mr. J. E. B. Hotson, C.S.I., O.B.E., who kindly placed his official records on the subject of the Aden Protectorate at my complete disposal. I also had the advantage of an inter view with the Governor of Bombay, the Right Honourable Su Leslie Wilson, G.C.I.E. Delay in India. 4 . I had taken the opportunity afforded by the steamer calling at Karachi to send a telegram from that place to the Resident at Aden, asking him to inform me by telegraph to Bombay oi the progress of preparations for the journey of the Mission to San‘a and of the date on which it would be required to leave /yden. On arrival at Bombay I received a reply to the effect that no answer had yet been received from the Imam on the subject of the proposed mission and that, in consequence, pre parations for the journey could not yet be completed. I had intended feaving Bombay on the 19th December and arriving at Aden on the 23rd December, but on receipt of the information contained in the Resident’s telegram I decided to postpone my departure from Bombay for another week. I did not wish to find myself delayed indefinitely at Aden pending the arrival of a communication from the Imam, thereby giving colour to pos *Cmd. 251S6.sible suggestions that I was awaiting his pleasure. Moreover, I found that the Government of Bombay were concerned only with administrative matters in respect to Aden and that to inform myself as to the political aspect of the question I must go to the Government of India at Delhi, which the extra week in India enabled me to do. Accordingly, after reading up all the relevant information available in the Political Office of the Government,^ of Bombay, I proceeded to Delhi with Mr. G. Antonius^ arriving there on the evening of the 17th December. Visit to Delhi. 5. At Delhi I had the advantage of conversations with Sir Denys Bray, K.C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and Lieut.-General Sir Andrew Skeen, K.C.I.E., Chief of the Staff, and was furnished with copies of official correspondence by means of which I was able to bring up to date my knowledge of the subject with which I had to deal. Departure from Bombay. 6 . I reached Bombay again on the 24th December and sailed for Aden in the P. &amp; O. s.s. “ Razmak ” on the 26th December, accompanied by Mr. G. Antonius and by Mr. R. V. Kaikini, whose services as clerk and stenographer to the Mission I had been enabled to obtain by the kind assistance of the authorities in Bombay. Arrival at Aden. 7. My arrival at Aden on the 30th December was well timed, as on the same day a letter was received b\ the Resident from the Imam Yahya consenting in cordial terms'to receive the Mission and stating that all necessary arrangements for its journey would be made as soon as the date of its arrival at Hodeida was notified to San‘a. Route to San'a. 8 . The Resident had suggested to the Imam that the Mission should proceed by the land route, through the Protectorate and via Mawia, Ibb, \ arim and Dhamar, but the Imam having ex pressed a decided preference for the route from Hodeida to San a I naturally fell in with his wishes without demur. ' — ' w ^ w r vvxj J -S ’ J w r riv y _ _ _ , _ # 9. After discussion with the Resident, and allowing sufficient time for the notification to reach San‘a and for the subsequent completion of the Imam’s arrangements, the 17th January was fixed for the arrival of the Mission at Hodeida and a message to that effect was despatched to the Imam Yahya. The RIMS Cornwallis ” was normally due to start from Aden on the 12 th January on her monthly visit to Perim, Kamaran and the light- houses m the Red Sea, calling at Hodeida on the morning? of the 17 th January. It was therefore settled that she should also carry the Mission, an arrangement which enabled me to visit lenm and Kamaran and to arrive at Hodeida on the appointed* Annexure 1. f Annexure 2. 5 Stay in Aden and Visit to Lahej. 10 . The intervening days were fully occupied in a careful study of the records in the Residency Office at Aden and in compre hensive discussions with the Resident, Major-General J. H. K. Stewart, C.B., D.S.O., who had communicated to me on my arrival the instructions contained in your telegram to him of lj^24th December, 1925,* and your despatch of the 4th Sep- te 4 .oer, 1924. f I was also given the opportunity of visiting Sir Abdul-Karim ibn Fadhl, K.C.I.E., Sultan of the Abdali at Lahej, where I also met Nasr ibn Shaif Saif, the Amir of Dhala, whose territories though lying within the .limits of the Protec torate had been occupied and taken under direct administration by the Imam. Departure from Aden, and Composition of Mission. 11 . The Mission sailed from Aden in R.I.M.S. “ Cornwallis ” on the evening of the 12th January, as arranged, and consisted of the following persons: — Sir Gilbert Clayton, Head of the Mission. Mr. George Antonius, Secretary to the Mission. Lieut.-Colonel M. C. Lake, LA., Adviser on Local Affairs. Lieut.-Colonel M. S. Irani, I.M.S., Medical Officer. Mr. R. V.

After calling at Perim we arrived on the 14th January at Kamaran, where I remained till the 16th January while the “ Cornwallis ” was visiting the light-houses at Jebel Tier, Centre Peak and Abu Ail. This arrangement afforded me an oppor tunity of visiting the Quarantine Station and harbour and of making a tour round the Island. H.M.S. “ Endeavour ” (Com mander Geary Hill, R.N.) was at anchor in the harbour in con nection with hydrographical survey work at Kamaran and in the vicinity. Arrival at Hodeida. 13. We left Kamaran at 5 p.m. on the 16th January and arrived at Hodeida at 7 a.m. on the 17th January. The British Political Clerk, Hasan Kanjuni, came on board to meet me and was fol lowed by representatives of the Kaid (Military Commander) of the district and of the ‘Amil (Local Governor) of Hodeida. On disembarking I proceeded to the house which serves as Office of the Political Clerk and then paid a formal call at the local Government Office, where the Mission was received very cor dially by the Kaid and the ‘Amil. Journey to San‘a. 14. The transport animals and an escort of an officer and 44 N.C.O’s and men of the Yemen Army being in readiness, our baggage and servants were sent off to Bajil (the first stage onthe journey) on that same evening and on the following afternoon the Mission proceeded to the same place by motor-car. From Bajil we proceeded on mule-back, making the journey in five stages and arriving at San‘a shortly before midday on the 24th January. Throughout the journey we were well received and every effort was made for our comfort by the Imam’s officials; indeed, at the towns and larger villages, especialb-*'** Menakha and when nearing San‘a, our welcome assumed official aspect, guards of honour were provided and a certain amount of ceremony observed. ’ Arrival at San‘a. 15. About five or six miles from San'a we were met by an escort of some fifty Imamic cavalry and by a pair-horse carriage which had been sent especially for my use by the Imam, and outside the gate of the city a guard of honour, of a battalion of Imamic infantry, was drawn up and paid the usual compli ments. We then entered the city and, accompanied by a large throng of all classes of the population, proceeded to a com modious stone-built house in the Bir el-‘Azab (the residential quarter), which had been prepared for our accommodation. Official Welcome at San'a. 16. About half-an-hour after my arrival I received a visit from four of the Imam’s principal officers: — Sayyid Abdullah ibn Ibrahim, Principal of the Theological College. Sayyid Ahmad al-Kibsi, Amil of Bilad er Rus. Raghib Bey, 2nd Secretary and Chamberlain to the Imam, and Qadi Abdul-Karim, 3rd Secretary to the Imam, who had been sent by the Imam to convey an official welcome to the Mission; and through them I sent suitable messages and thanks to His Highness. Official Meeting with the Imam. 17. As the Imam had intimated his desire to receive me with some degree of ceremony, for which a certain amount of pre paration was necessary, it was arranged that I should defer my visit until the 26th January. At 9 a.m. on that day, therefore, I proceeded by motor-car to the Palace, where I was received by a guard of honour, the street leading to the Palace being lined on either side by troops. The meeting was purely formal and, after the presentations had taken place, I read my letter of appointment in English, which was then translated into Arabic. The Imam caused a reply to be read by his Chamberlain and, after a few minutes’ general conversation, withdrew to his private apartments. Basis of Discussion. 18. After studying the history of the negotiations with the Imam Yahya, as recorded in the correspondence with which 1 was furnished by the Government of India and by the Resident, Aden, 1 had formed the opinion that the task which I had before7 me involved considerably more than the mere “ clearing up of a few outstanding points ” envisaged in Foreign Office telegram No. 279 of the 18th November* to Lord Lloyd, Cairo, for Sir G. Clayton. A careful perusal of the Imam’s letters in the original Arabic by Mr. G. Antonius gave the impression that, far from agreeing to the principle set forth in Article 3 of the raft of August, 1924,f as suggested in the Resident’s telegram o. 48 of the 10th January, 1925,J he intended to press for a recognition of the rights which he claims, on historical grounds, to suzerainty over the tribes inhabiting the present Protectorate of Aden and to maintain the hold which he has established over certain districts on the Aden side of the boundary. Moreover, the situation had altered materially since August, 1924. When the Draft of August, 1924, was drawn up, and during the whole course of the negotiations which led up to it, a prominent factor in the situation was the proposal to induce the Idrisi, by means of persuasion and a grant of money, to relinquish Hodeida, which was then to be handed over to the Imam as a quid pro quo for his recognition of the Protectorate boundary and his withdrawal from the districts which he had occupied in the Aden Protectorate. Further, in the early stages of the nego tiations the Imam’s representative at Aden had been given to understand that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to consider the grant of a subsidy to the Imam. The situation has now been radically changed by the occupation of Hodeida by the Imam without British intervention or assistance; by the decline of the Idrisi’s power, which is not at present so serious a menace to. the Imam; and by the decision of His Majesty’s Government to the effect that the grant of a subsidy can no longer be considered. I therefore found myself in the position, in the light of the instructions contained in your telegram of the 24th December, 1925, § of having to face the Imam with what amounts to an ulti matum in regard to the question of the Protectorate boundary, without being able to offer any compensating advantage which would incline him to accept a proposal to which he is strongly opposed as being a renunciation of what he considers his right ful claims and also a serious blow to his personal prestige. With these considerations in mind I formed the opinion that it would only be possible to secure the Imam’s signature to the Draft Treaty by persuading him that it was in his best interests and those of his country to secure the permanent friendship of Great Britain, even at the price of certain sacrifices, and by em phasising, in general terms, the regrettable situation which would arise if he refused to meet His Majesty’s Government on a point of principle which they were determined to maintain. Preliminary Discussions with the Imam. 19. My first two discussions with the Imam, which were held on the 28th and 30th of January, confirmed the accuracy of the appreciation of the situation which I had previously formed. He gave no sign of relinquishing his attitude, and it was only at the conclusion of the second meeting that he agreed to send repre- * Annexure 3. Annexure 2. J Annexure 4. §Annexurel.Annexure 5. f Annexure 6. 8 sentatives to discuss the question in greater detail with my representative, Mr. G. Antonins, in the hope that some way might be found of adjusting our conflicting points of view. Discussions between the Imam’s representatives and Mr. G. Antonius. 20 . Conversations lasting for nearly a week then took plar-^—. between Mr. G. Antonius on my part and Sayyid Abdullah ib w Ibrahim and Qadi Abdullah el ‘Amri on behalf of the Imam, but little progress was made. The Imam’s representatives were either unwilling or afraid to advance from the position which the Imam himself had taken up at the earlier meetings, and it was only after lengthy discussion that they eventually submitted, informally and subject to the Imam’s approval, a counter-draft* of Article 3, which I was totally unable to accept either in prin ciple or in detail. Having been informed to this effect, they retired and, after an interval of three days’ consideration, they returned on the 6 th February with a complete counter-draftf of the treaty which, as will be seen, is so entirely in conflict with the principles on which the Draft of August, 1924, is based as to be impossible of acceptance and hardly susceptible even of discussion. Knowing something of the methods and mentality of Arab diplomatists and making full allowance for the peculiarly remote and secluded conditions in which these particular persons have been born and bred, I had been reluctant to hurry matters and anxious to give full scope for the development of the arguments which the Imam wished to put forward. A fortnight had now elapsed, however, during which lengthy discussion had produced no result beyond the presentation by the Imam’s representatives of an entirely unacceptable counter draft, the terms of which showed no advance whatever on the part of the Imam towards meeting the requirements of His Majesty’s Government. I decided, therefore, that the time had come when it was necessary for me to place the issues clearly before the Imam himself and face him with the necessity of giving me a definite answer on the main question of principle on which alone the proposed treaty could be based. Discussions with the Imam. 21. I, accordingly, requested an interview with the Imam at which I laid the main issue clearly before him, pointing out that no agreement was possible unless it was based on his recog nition of the Protectorate Treaties and the boundary as demar cated in 1903, 1904 and 1905, and on his undertaking to with draw from districts which he had occupied on the Aden side of that boundary. If he found himself unable to accept these premises no agreement was possible, and the only course open to me was to take my departure at once and return to London to report to my Government. I added that failure to reach an agreement now would be most regrettable, as it would aggra vate an already sufficiently unsatisfactory situation and 'must* Annexure 7. 9 postpone indefinitely the promotion of those friendly relations which were sincerely desired by His Majesty’s Government and which—I ventured to think—were in the best interests of the Yemen. I urg'ed the Imam, therefore, to reflect very carefully before letting pass a chance, which might not recur for a long time, of laying the foundation of permanent amity and co operation with a Power which was his immediate neighbour and hich was bound by vital interests to maintain a position of predominance on its main line of Imperial communications. The Imam appeared impressed but still insisted that, though he. sincerely desired agreement with Great Britain and was fully sensible of the advantage to the Yemen of her friendship and co-operation, he was quite unable to sign any treaty which might be interpreted as a final and definite surrender of rights which had been maintained by his country for over 1,000 years. He begged me earnestly, however, before breaking off negotiations finally, to reconsider the question very carefully and see whether I could not find a formula which w r ould help him to overcome a difficulty which at present appeared insuperable. 22. I was now convinced that there was no chance of obtain ing the Imam’s signature to an agreement unless I was pre pared to modify the terms of the Draft of August, 1924. Apart from his own feelings in the matter, he was obviously afraid of public opinion and unable to face any diminution of the personal prestige on which his authority is based. I was therefore faced with the responsibility of choosing one of two possible alternatives. I might act on the strict letter of my instructions and break off negotiations, thereby closing the door to further discussion and producing a situation which could only be dealt with by forcible measures and which must almost certainly develop into one of passive, if not active, hostility along the whole boundary of the Aden Protectorate. On the other hand, I might, by modifying the draft to suit the existing circumstances and deferring the Imam’s claims for future dis cussion and settlement, without prejudice to the standpoint of either party, secure the Imam’s signature to an Agreement which would follow, in other respects, the lines of the Draft of August, 1924, and would, for the period of that Agreement, secure the interests which His Majesty’s Government were deter mined to maintain. After a careful review of the situation in all its aspects I had no hesitation in taking the responsibility of adopting the latter course, and some of the considerations which influenced me in taking that decision are developed in fuller detail in a memoran dum which I am submitting under separate cover. 23. On the following day, therefore, 1 sought another inter view with the Imam, and Mr. Antonins read to him a provisional draft* of a Preamble and certain Articles of a suggested Agree ment, making it quite clear that, subject to modification on minor . points, I had advanced as far as possible in the direction of meeting his point of view and that it was now for him to decide10 whether, or not, an agreement was possible. The Imam seemed to think that he might find himself able to accept these proposals, but asked if he might have twenty-four hours in which to think them over. I therefore left the provisional draft with him on the understanding that he would give me his reply on the follow ing day. 24. On the 11 th February I again visited the Imam and aske^* him for a reply on the subject of the provisional draft which T had submitted to him on the previous day. His Highness replied that lie had considered it and that, in view of his sincere desire to come to an agreement, he was prepared to accept the draft with a few verbal alterations, but that he would greatly prefer that the Article dealing with his withdrawal from occupied districts in the Aden Protectorate should not appear in the treaty but should be made the subject of an exchange of letters. As the Article in question does not appear in the Draft of August, 1924, I saw no objection to acceding to this request. 25. The Imam then said that there was one point on which he found himself absolutely unable to give way. He could not possibly agree to withdraw from the district of Dhala and those other districts where his regular administration had been in existence for some years, was now fully established and had resulted in a state of good order and security hitherto unknown to the population. I replied deeply regretting a decision which was in direct opposition to my instructions from Plis Majesty’s (jovernment and which would, I feared, render the conclusion of a treaty impossible. I he Imam, however, maintained his attitude firmly, though he showed considerable concern and urge'd me to see whether I could not suggest some way out of the difficulty. I was very reluctant to break off negotiations there and then, and so nullify all the progress which had been made up to date; moreover, I wished to see how far the Imam was prepared to meet me on all other points. I therefore informed His High ness that 1 would discuss this specific question with him finally at a later date provided we could in the meantime come to an agreement in regard to a complete draft of a treaty. The Imam concurred and agreed to send his representatives at once with a view to completing discussions on the various Articles of the Draft of August, 1924. 26. After lengthy discussion lasting for three days, Mr. Antonius succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the Imam's representatives to a draft of the treaty which was substantially m accordance with the Draft of August, 1924, with the exception ot some five or six points on which agreement was not arrived at and which were therefore reserved for discussion between the Imam and myself. anu au^ccucu ni reaenmg agree nient a ! 1 ^ three important points, which were his recog Protectorate Treaties, the definition of the frontie J he . lan g ua §: e m which the treaty was to be concluded. Oi e first two points the Imam was most persistent and producecj II various formulae in an endeavour to meet my point of view, while avoiding definite recognition of the Protectorate Treaties and of the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Agreement, instruments to which he maintained that he had never been a party. In regard to the question of the language, he insisted that it must be Arabic and was quite firm in refusing to put his name to any document which ^^was not in a language which he was able to understand. I met the third point by agreeing that the Treaty should be drawn up in English and in Arabic, each party signing in his own lan guage, but the interview came to an end without any definite settlement having been arrived at in regard to the first two points. 27. On that same evening, however, the Imam sent me a com plete draft* of the treaty purporting to embody the results of all our discussions up to date, with a message to the effect that he hoped that agreement had now been reached. On studying this draft I found to my surprise and disappointment that no notice had been taken of the various points on which agreement had been reached and that the draft, far from being based on that of August, 1924, differed very little from his first draft, which I had already stated was entirely unacceptable. We were, therefore, back again at our starting point, and I realised that the time had now come when I must consider seriously refusing further discussion and breaking off negotiations. 28. I was still reluctant, however, to break off negotiations until no other possible course was open; so I determined to see the Imam again and to resume discussion at the point which we had reached at our last interview, ignoring altogether the last draft which he had submitted unless he himself alluded to it, in which case I would inform him that it was entirely unacceptable and that I could not even discuss it. This course of action proved successful and a very lengthy discussion took place on the wording of Article 4 of my draft,f during the course of which I took the opportunity of telling His Highness quite frankly that, though prepared to defer his claims for future dis cussion without prejudice to the point of view of either party, I was quite unable to admit into the treaty any clause which would question or weaken the present position of Great Britain in the Aden Protectorate. Eventually, we reached a stage to wards agreement which put me in a position to say that I would now put forward to the Imam a final draft of the treaty, which would represent my last word and which must either be rejected or accepted without alteration or amendment. 29. Accordingly on the 16th February, I submitted a complete draftj to Plis Highness under cover of a letter in which I made it clear that I deprecated further discussion and begged him to inform me as soon as possible whether or not he was prepared to accept the draft. The Imam replied on the same day by a letter in which he still urged reconsideration, without specifying any particular points, but as I had already discussed with him fully the wording of those articles which embodied questions of * Annexure 8. ■j- Annexure 6. X Annexure 9.12 principle and had gone as far as I considered possible towards meeting his objections, I did not hold out any hope of altering a text which had been decided upon after full consideration of all the arguments. 30. At our next meeting, on the 18th February, we discussed my draft* of the 16th February at great length and the Imam made a number of requests for amendment, raising several points which had never been mentioned at any previous con- ^ ' versation, either with him or with his advisers. I was aware, however, that on the previous day he had submitted my draft ^ J ar £rc meeting of notables and had been somewhat severely criticised in various quarters, so I realised that many of the points raised did not originate with the Imam himself. 31. As a result of this conversation I agreed to see what alterations, if any, I could make in my draft with a view to meet ing the difficulties which I knew that His Majesty was encoun tcring from some of his advisers and from an extremist but influential section of his people, and to submit them to him un officially and without committing either party to their adoption. 32. At the same time I reminded the Imam that the crucial question of his evacuation of Protectorate territory still re mained to be settled. He had informed me definitely that he was unable to consider the evacuation of any of those territories in which he had established a regular administration, but he bad given me to understand that this refusal did not include districts which he was only occupying in a military manner in order to defend himself from alleged aggression by the tribes men. Before we could profitably discuss this question or I could seek any way of surmounting the difficulty which he had raised I must have a definite statement from him of the dis tricts in which he held that he had established a regular ad ministration. I therefore asked him for a detailed list of those districts. 33. On that same evening I submitted, unofficially and unac companied by any covering letter, certain suggestions-}- for amendment of the draft with a view to ascertaining finally whether the Imam was really disposed to meet me on ground which promised any possibility of agreement. 34. On the 20 th February I saw the Imam again and asked him whether he considered that my suggestions afforded a pos sible solution in regard to the question of the treaty. I was once more met with further requests for amendment on minor points but agreement was reached on all the clauses in which questions of importance were involved. I therefore turned to the question of evacuation of those territories of which he was in occupation and which lay within the borders of the Protectorate. I informed him that His Majesty’s Government had instructed me to make it quite clear that his evacuation of those districts was a necessary corollary to the treaty and that I could not, therefore, admit his point of view or allow anything to be inserted in the treaty which could in any way weaken the position * Annexure 9. f Annexure 10.*3 of His Majesty’s Government in regard to this question. I had agreed to defer the general settlement of his claims for the duration of the treaty, but I could not agree to prejudice the British claim in regard to that settlement by admitting in any way whatsoever a position which His Highness had obtained by- force and in the face of constant protest by His Majesty’s Govern ment. ihe most that I could do was to report this difficulty to &lt;Ais Majesty’s Government and to make the whole treaty subject 10 their ratification, thus leaving open the door for a possible removal by friendly arrangement of what was at present a bar to the conclusion of a treaty. I was only able to do this, how ever, if His Highness was prepared to meet me on all other points and also to give proof of a spirit of accommodation in regard to the question of evacuation. 1 had studied his list of those territories regarding which he maintained that evacuation was impossible, and it contained a number of dis tricts which 1 was unable to admit as falling within the category of districts in which he had established a regular administration. I quoted particularly the Radfan tribes (which include the Kutaibi, the Ahl Murra, the Mahalai, the Hajaili, the Dairi and the Bakri), the Alawi and also the Subeihi country in which he had en croached on various villages v/hich lay on the Aden side of the frontier. The Imam maintained that he could not evacuate ap portions of those tribal districts of which he was now in occu pation, and he laid a special stress on the villages of the Subaihi district, in reference to which he stated that he could not recog nise the frontier in any cases where that frontier included within the Protectorate villages or districts which he held to be under his jurisdiction. ' In other words, he endeavoured once more to substitute for ihe demarcated frontier which he had already im plicitly accepted a tribal boundary defined—to use his own words —as “ the well-known boundary recognised by tribal usage be tween the Subeihi tribes and our own province of Mokha.” 35. I had now gone as far as was possible towards meeting the Imam’s point of view, and from his whole attitude during the course of this interview I saw that he was still trying to evade recognition of the demarcated frontier. He had, throughout, endeavoured to secure my agreement to a vague boundary based on tribal areas in place of the frontier demarcated in 1903, 1904 and 1905, but I had as consistently opposed any such suggestion as being contrary to my instructions and unsatisfactory in practice. Break-off of Negotiations. 36. I now realised that further discussion would only confuse the main issues, and I informed His Highness that, much to mv regret, I had come to the conclusion that agreement was impos sible without one party or the other giving way on questions of principle which they were determined to maintain. I was there fore forced to the decision to break off our conversations and return to London to report to my Government. The Imam ac cepted this statement without any attempt to dissuade me from my decision, from which I gathered that he shared my opinion. He expressed deep regret at our inability to reach an understand-ing, but hoped that I should realise his position and explain his point of view fully to His Majesty’s Government. He empha sised his desire to come to a friendly understanding with His Majesty’s Government and expressed the hope that our failure to reach an agreement now would not prevent the desired object from being attained in the future. I replied that our meeting had at least resulted in a frank interchange of views which Would serve to clarify the situation and prevent future misconceptii^* and took my leave in an atmosphere of protestations of mutifal friendship and regard. Departure from San‘a and Return to Aden. 37. On the following day I paid my farewell visit to the Imam, which was marked by a considerable amount of ceremony and every indication of a desire to pay all possible honour to a repre sentative of His Majesty’s Government. The street leading to the palace was lined on either side by troops with bands and colours, and inside the gates a guard of honour was drawn up. The Imam was exceedingly friendly and reiterated his desire for friendly relations with Great Britain, expressing the hope that the explanations which I was’now in a position to give to His Majesty’s Government would lead to eventual agreement. I assured His Highness that, while unable to say what attitude His Majesty’s Government would take up, 1 should not fail to put his point of view before them; at the same time, I urged him to refrain from further encroachment and, if possible, to withdraw at least from those districts in which he had not established a regular administration, as I was convinced that proof of a con ciliatory disposition on his part would tend to relieve the situa tion which had been produced by our failure to come to an agree ment. 38. On the afternoon of the 21st February the Mission left San‘a ana returned to Aden by the land route via Dhamar, Ibb and Mawia. The Imam furnished an escort of eight mounted men and twenty-five infantry, who accompanied us as far as the frontier of the Protectorate, where we were met by a detachment of the Aden troop under the command of Major T. M. Carpen- dale. The Mission reached Aden on the afternoon of the 3rd March. 39. Throughout the return journey the Mission was received with even more respect and consideration than on the march from Plodeida to San‘a. At every town—indeed at nearly every village —we were met by guards of honour, parades of troops and large crowds of the local population. It was evident that the Imam had issued special orders to the effect that every possible honour should be paid to us, and I was informed on several occasions that no foreigner had ever been given such a reception in the Yaman. 40. I remained in Aden for a week, which was occupied in liquidating the affairs of the Mission and in explaining fully the situation to the Resident, and embarked on the 10th March in the P. &amp; O. s.s. “ Maloja ” for Marseilles, arriving in London on the evening of Saturday, the 20th March.— ■■■ 15 41. I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of the services rendered by all the members of the Mission.

General Observations. 43. I regret that I have been unsuccessful in attaining the main object of my mission, but I feel that, bearing in mind the change which has taken place in the situation since the Draft Treaty of August, 1924, was drawn up, it was impossible to negotiate any treaty strictly on those lines. I strained my instructions to the limit in an endeavour to reach agreement—indeed, I may perhaps be held to have gone too far—and, although the Imam’s refusal to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the evacuation of those districts in the Aden Protectorate of which he is now in occupation, rendered it impossible for me to reach any definite conclusion, I venture to think that my discussions with him have not been entirely fruitless. Personal contact has been established for the first time and the Imam’s views and as pirations, which no amount of correspondence could have dis closed, have now been ascertained. Moreover, the result of my conversations with him in regard to the text of a treaty indicates the lines on which alone he is likely to conclude a formal agree ment.i6 44. It is clear that the Imam is determined to maintain two definite points (if principle, namely, he will not put his name to any document which he considers can be interpreted as a renun ciation of any of what he terms “ his historical claims to suzerainty over the whole of the Yemen,” including the Aden Protectorate and the Hadramaut; he will not accept any clause which may be taken as in any way infringing his complete in dependence and liberty of action. 45. I do not consider, however, that either of these two points of principle need necessarily present an insuperable obstacle to the conclusion of a treaty in the future, and the lines on which the provisional draft,* to which he implicitly agreed, is framed, are an indication of the manner in which the difficulty might be surmounted. 46. A more serious complication is caused by the Imam’s defi nite refusal to withdraw from the Aden Protectorate. If he is allowed to remain undisturbed in territory which he has occupied in tiie face of British protests, he will be convinced of the efficacy of a policy of gradual encroachment and will doubtless continue to follow it; the reactionary and anti-foreign party in the Yemen will gain strength; the Imam and his people will lose a large measure of respect for Great Britain; British prestige in the Aden hinterland and throughout south-east Arabia will suffer greatly. On the other hand, the Imam has shown what I believe to be a genuine desire for friendly relations with Great Britain, and I incline to the opinion that he would not offer very obstinate re sistance to measures for his forcible expulsion, provided he were convinced that His Majesty’s Government were determined to carry the matter through and had provided the means wherewith to do so. Forcible action combined with the clear announcement of an objective strictly limited to the re-establishment of the Protectorate boundary would not, I think, surprise or render him permanently hostile, especially if he were assured of a willingness to enter subsequently into friendly relations on generous lines; tiie influence of the party in the Yemen which is insistent against any foreign connexions would be weakened, and the way would be paved for a future treaty by promoting a feeling of healthy respect for Great Britain as a Power which, though tolerant up to the furthest possible point, does not hesitate to maintain its rights when the limit has been passed. 47. I realise, however, that for various reasons His Majesty’s Government may find it impossible to undertake military opera tions on the scale which would be required for the immediate expulsion of the Imam from the whole of the Aden Protectorate. If this be the case, I can only suggest as a not very satisfactory compromise that the military resources at the disposal of the General Officer Commanding, Aden, be increased, especially in regard to suitable aircraft, to an extent which will enable him to repel promptly and with energy any further encroachment by the Imam’s forces and by steady and continuous pressure to secure their retirement from those districts of which they are * Annexure 10.i7 only in partial occupation. When these results have been at tained it may be possible to extend similar and progressive action to Dhala and those portions of the Protectorate in which the Imam has a more firm footing. It will be necessary simultaneously to reorganise and strengthen the civil administration in Aden in order that the Political Resident may be in a position to assume ^dequate control over the protected tribes, with a view to securing kme measure of cohesion for purposes of self-defence and of useful co-operation with His Majesty’s forces. 48. At the same time I suggest that it be made clear to the Imam that the desire of His Majesty’s Government for ultimate friendly relations with the Yemen remains unchanged; that any hostile action against him within the limits of the Protectorate is designed merely to safeguard rights, which have already been fully explained to him; and that no aggression is intended against the Yemen itself, the independence of which is fully recognised. In this connection, I should deprecate for the present any form of naval action, other than mere demonstration, against Hodeida or any of the Imam’s ports, though it might be hinted to him that a blockade is always possible and may become necessary if he persists in a policy of opposition to the rightful claims of His Majesty’s Government. 49. In conclusion, I venture to recommend that the attitude and policy of His Majesty’s Government be explained quite clearly to the Imam before any definitely hostile action is taken. I have, etc., GILBERT CLAYTON. ANNEXURE 1. 57516/25. The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Political Resident at Aden. [Telegram.] 24th December, 1925.

(b) Except for minor points Imam accepted Draft Treaty at previous negotiations, and present negotiations follow same lines. * Annexure 2. t Annexure 4.i 8 Point raised by Board of Trade should be considered and endeavour should be made to obtain desired modifications, vide my despatch of 30th April, No. 27.* Insistence on withdrawal of Imam’s troops from Protec torate before signature is not absolutely necessary. That withdrawal of all his troops from Protectorate is necessary corollary of the treaty to which he will then be a party shoul^* however, be made quite clear to him.” Ends. Above instructions are for Sir G. Clayton. Copies of all correspondence will doubtless be supplied to him by you. I leave it to your discretion in consultation with Clayton to decide how instructions of His Majesty’s Government regarding the question of Sheikh Sa'id may best be carried out.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Political Resident, Aden. Downing Street, 4th September, 1924. (Secret.) Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Secret des patch No. 99 of the 31st July,} with which was enclosed the Imam’s counter-draft to the draft of 25th October, 1923. This counter-draft has been carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government, and a new draft which may be referred to as the “ Draft of August, 1924,” is transmitted herewith, in which as many as possible of the Imam’s suggestions have been adopted. 2 . Before proceeding to treat with the draft treaty Article by Article, there are two general points which arise in more than one Article and which it will be convenient to deal with at this point. These are:—(a) the necessity for His Majesty’s Govern ment to avoid being compelled to act in conflict with any inter national obligation by which they are or may be bound; and (b) the desire of the Imam to protect himself against delay or un reasonable refusal on the part of His Majesty’s Government to supply material aid which the Imam agrees by this Treaty to apply for to His Majesty’s Government alone. His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot undertake any obligation in this Treaty which shall override their international obligations. As regards the second point, in the event of His Majesty’s Government finding them selves unable for any reason to meet any specific demand for the material aid referred to above, they would be prepared to agree that the Imam shall, after due warning has been given and a reasonable period of time has elapsed, be free to apply elsewhere for his requirements. * Annexure 2. } Annexure 2. § No. 53083/25 : not printed. } No. 38336/24 ; not printed.*9 Article 1. 3. His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to define in this instrument the exact territory over which the Imam exercises authority; nor are they prepared to adopt his alternative word ing, which is unsatisfactory and ambiguous. The wording of the draft of 25th October has accordingly been retained. Article 2. The Imam’s draft has been accepted but the words “ the British Government ” at the end of the Article have been altered to “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Article 3. The object of this Article is to define the territory within which His Majesty’s Government are bound by their Protectorate treaties not to permit the interference of the Imam, i.e., to obtain the Imam’s recognition to the boundary of the Aden Protectorate. His Majesty’s Government cannot admit that the Imam has any rights whatever within the Protectorate and ‘have accordingly rejected his draft. They observe that even in the first of the two parts into which he proposes to divide the Protectorate, he makes his own non-interference conditional upon the administra tion of justice by the local Chiefs in confonnity with the Moslem religion, and they agree with the Acting Political Resident that it is clearly his intention that he should himself be the judge whether or not this condition is being fulfilled. His Majesty’s Government will admit no condition of this kind in either of the two parts into which the Imam proposes that the Protectorate should be divided, and must insist upon this Article containing a clear and unmistakable definition of the territory within which no interference of any kind can be permitted. They have accord ingly adopted the wording previously submitted to the Imam by you and reported to Mr. Churchill in Article 12 of Appendix “ C ” to your Secret despatch of the 6 th July, 1922.* You will observe that the word “ recognises ” has been adopted instead of the word ” acknowledges ” since it is desirable that the Imam should bind himself not merely to acknowledge the existence of the Protectorate Treaties but to recognise their validity. His Majesty’s Government have retained the words “ not to send any of his armed forces across the frontier,” but it should be explained to the Imam that he is expected not merely to refrain from send ing further forces across the frontier, but also to withdraw forces in the Aden Protectorate at the time, as soon as the Treaty has been signed. Article 4. Plis Majesty’s Government has restored the proviso relating to their international obligation, but apart from this they have accepted the Imam’s draft for this Article with the exception of the last sentence, which has been redrafted in accordance with the principles laid down in paragraph 2 of this despatch. You should explain to the Imam that the Clause in this Article, as also in No. 34727/22 : not printed.-Cv 20 Articles 6 , 12 and 14, which provides that the Imam should await His Majesty’s Government’s acknowledgment of his notification that he proposes to make other arrangements has been inserted to provide for his satisfying himself that his notification has actually reached the British Authorities. His Majesty’s Govern ment will, of course, acknowledge his notification without delay. You may, however, at' your discretion omit the words “ and awaits their acknowledgment thereof before doing so ” in th'^ articles referred to if the Imam is unwilling to accept them. v Article 5. In view of the Acting Political Resident’s comment, His Majesty’s Government have decided to retain the original draft of this Article. Article 6 . His Majesty’s Government accept the Imam’s draft with the addition of a sentence corresponding to the last sentence of para graph 2 . 1 Article 7. No remarks. Article 8 . re [ erence to ^ rt i c ^ e 9 has been misplaced in translation. 1 ms has been corrected in the fresh draft. No remarks. Article 9. Article 10.

The wording of this Article in the Draft of October, 1923, was very carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government, who cannot agree to any alteration in its scope. His Majesty’s Government have, however, accepted the recommendation of the Political Resident at Aden and have adopted the phrase “ for the /■Nurpose of the complete achievement of the longed-for peace.”* fhey have also slightly altered the wording of the original Article in order to meet the Imam’s objections. Article 12. In view of the last sentence of the Acting Political Resident’s comments on this Article, you should again present to the Imam the British draft, with the slight modification in its concluding sentence which is shown in the fresh draft, and which conforms with the general principles laid down in paragraph 2 above. Article 13. See paragraph 2 . A reference to the international obligations of His Majesty’s Government has again been inserted in the fresh draft and must be insisted upon. Apart from this the Imam’s draft has been accepted. Article 14. His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the Imam’s counter draft as it stands and would much prefer to retain the original draft. 1 he draft suggested by the Imam would place him in a position to blackmail His Majesty’s Government into granting whatever terms he considered fit in regard to the lighting of the Mokha Lighthouse. You should, therefore, press for the original draft, and if you are unable to obtain this you should press for some such wording as the following for the last sentence of Article 14: — His Excellency the Imam will give priority to His Britannic Majesty’s Government in this matter, and after mutual agreement as to the manner in which the lighting is to be arranged His Excellency the Imam will not enter into any agreement with any other Government in this respect. If no agreement is arrived at His Excellency the Imam will then be free to make other arrangements, provided that he gives prior notice to His Britannic Majesty’s Government of his intention to do so, and provided that he grants to no other party more favourable terms than those offered to His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Article 15. If the Imam is not prepared to accept the Draft of October, 1923, His Majesty’s Government consider that this Article should be omitted altogether, and that the question should be dealt with in connexion with the cognate subject of Extradition by means of a separate agreement. No remarks. Article 16.22 r' Lower Aulaki Sultan. Haushabi. I &gt;huaib (Haura). Wahidiof Bir AH. Wahidi of Balahaf. Aqrabi Sbeikh. Fadli Sultan. Atifi Sheikh. Alawi Sheikh. Lower Yafai Sultan.

His Majesty’s Government agree that the term of the Treaty should be extended to ten years, if the Imam so desires. 4. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to leave it to your discretion whether the “ Draft of August, 1924,” should be pre sented to the Imam as the last word of His Majesty’s Govern- •ment or not. There appears to be distinct advantages in adoptin' - ** this attitude, but they do not wish to decide the point in advance': 5. With regard to the question of Hodeida, no financial pro vision has been made in this financial year to compensate the Idrisi for the retrocession of that port. I remain, however, of opinion that the conclusion of an agreement with the Idrisi should be reached simultaneously with the conclusion of the Yemen Treaty, and His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to ask Parliament to revote the £ 20,000 which lapsed owing to the death of the late Idrisi. I have, &amp;c. (for the Secretary of State), HENRY LAMBERT. Draft of August, 1924. 1. His Britannic Majesty’s Government acknowledge the ab solute independence of His Excellency the Imam in all political and administrative matters internal and external and his authority in the territories which are under His Excellency. Nothing in this clause is to be considered as a contradiction of what is stated in Article 2. 2 . His Excellency the Imam shall not correspond with or make any engagement with any Government or with anyone on any matter prejudicial to His Britannic Majesty’s Government and similarly His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall not corre spond with or make any engagement with any Government what ever or with any one on any matter prejudicial to His Excellency the Imam’s Government. His Excellency the Imam is at liberty to correspond or enter into engagements with any Government whatever on matters which are not prejudicial to His Britannic Majesty’s Government. 3. His Excellency the Imam recognises the Protectorate Treaties made by His Britannic Majesty’s Government with the tribes of the Aden Protectorate as shown in the margin. He undertakes not to send any of his armed forces across the frontier demarcated by the Turkish and British Governments in 1904 or to interfere in any way with the peoples inhabiting the Aden side of the boundary line. A 4. Plis Excellency the Imam will apply only to His Britannic Majesty s Government for the arms and ammunition, war materials, &amp;c., that he may need for the organisation and defence of his country, and His Britannic Majesty’s Government will supply him so far as their international obligations permit at easy and fair lates and as soon as possible with a sufficient quantity23 of what is mentioned. If for any reason His Britannic Majesty’s Government are unable to meet His Excellency the Imam’s re quirements, they will so inform him without delay, and His Excellency the Imam shall then be free to make other arrange ments provided that he gives prior notice to His Britannic Majesty’s Government of his intention and awaits their Uppe^AuiaiTi.^acknowledgment thereof before doing so.

If for any reason His Britannic Majesty’s Government are unable to meet His Excellency the Imam’s requirements they will so inform him without delay, and His Excellency the Imam shall then be free to make other arrange ments provided that he gives prior notice to His uritannic Majesty’s Government of his intention and awaits their acknow ledgment thereof before doing so. 7.

These rights and privileges shall be agreed upon after the decision as to the places at which the agents of the two Governments shall reside. 8 .

In the event of any dispute arising between His Excellency the Imam and any such Arab chief His Excellency the Imam shall inform His Britannic Majesty’s Government as soon as possible in older that His Britannic Majesty’s Government may advise the Arab Chief concerned to refrain from such aggression If the Chief does not accept their advice, then His Britannic Majesty s Government undertake to restrain him by all peaceful and practicable means in their power.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident, Aden. Downing Street, 30th April, 1925. (No. 27.) Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 32 of the 18th of March,* on the subject of certain additions which the Board of Trade have suggested should be incorporated in the proposed Treaty with the Imam of San a, and to transmit here with, for your consideration, a copy of a further letter which has been received from the Board of Trade on the subject. 2 You will observe that the only point on which there is now any question of altering the text of the Treaty is as regards the wording of Article IX. I am of the opinion that it would be undesirable to make a formal communication to the Imam regard-26 No. 14434/25 ; not printed. ing an alteration in the text of the Treaty, but I should be glad if you would consider whether, if and when negotiations on the subject are re-opened, it might not be possible to make some small addition to the text so as to cover the point raised by the Board of Trade. 3. I desire further to direct your attention to the last paragraph of the enclosed letter. I concur in the view that no agreemej«v should be reached under Article XIV of the Treaty without fu. consideration of the question by His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c., (For the Secretary of State); W. ORMSBY-GORE. Commercial Relations and Treaties Department, Board of Trade, Great George Street, London, S.W.l. 27th April, 1925. C.R.T. 1126/25. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 1st April,* transmitting copy of a despatch from the Political Resident at Aden, on the subject of the proposed Treaty with the Imam of San‘a, T am directed by the Board of Trade to state that they now under stand that the expression “ dues ” as used in Article VIII is intended to include only charges levied on the transport of goods, while the “ taxes ” on goods referred to in Article IX would be of the nature of customs or consumption duties. 1 he Board would still prefer, should this become practicable, that Article IX should be amended to secure most-favoured-nation treatment in terms for British goods as distinct from most favoured-nation treatment for British subjects who may import them, but failing this it might be feasible to make it clearer that the “ taxes on the subjects ” referred to in Article IX do in fact include duties levied on the goods imported by such subjects. As regards Article XIV, the Mokha Lighthouse is one of the four lighthouses for the Red Sea, the construction and main tenance of which was conceded in 1899 by the Turkish Govern ment to the Administrative Generale des Phares de 1 ’Empire Ottoman. 1 he future of the other three lighthouses is, as Mr. Secretary Amery will be aware, now the subject of correspondence between the foreign Office and the French Ambassador, and it is accordingly desirable that nothing should be agreed under this Article XIV or otherwise, in regard to the future of the Mokha Light without full consideration of the bearing of any such agree ment on the question of the other lights.

Foreign Office (279) to the High Commissioner for Egypt. [Telegram.] \ 18th November, 1925. Following for Sir G. Clayton from Secretary of State for the Colonies : — Begins: You will have seen from my earlier message tht^ I approve your proceeding, to Jerusalem and Bagdad to com plete the good work already done by you with ibn Sa‘ud. It has occurred to me that you might perhaps be willing during your stay in the Middle East to undertake another negotiation for which your experience and qualifications suit you. As you probably know, we have been trying for the last three years to conclude a treaty with the Imam of Yemen. For various reasons, amongst which the most im portant was the temporary occupation of Hodeida by Idrisi, these negotiations have not yet come to a successful issue. The Imam has asked that a British envoy should be sent to San'a in order to clear up a few outstanding points. Present position is that he is actively if not openly encouraging his followers to encroach upon the Aden Protectorate and that air action has had to be taken in support of the Protectorate tribes. This action has not proved entirely successful and His Majesty’s Government are anxious to use every effort to establish permanent conditions in the hinterland of Aden without recourse to armed force. They therefore desire to accede to the Imam’s request and to send an envoy to San‘a. It is clearly desirable that the envoy should proceed with the least possible delay in order that further complications on the Protectorate frontier may be avoided. If you would agree to extend your period of employment under the Colonial Office for this purpose you might proceed by sea to Aden from ‘Iraq after completing your discussions with the High Commissioner and the ‘Iraq Government at Baghdad and the Resident at Aden, to whom this telegram is being repeated, would in the meantime be able to make the necessary arrangements for your journey to San'a and your reception by the Imam. I should explain that the pro posed mission has the support of the Resident at Aden, who has asked His Majesty’s Government to nominate an officer for the purpose as no local Political Officer can be spared. If you accept, full instructions will be sent to you in due course: Ends. Please repeat to Aden.* No. 40896/24 : not printed. 29 1828/25. ANNEXURE 4. The Political Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. [Telegram.] (No. 48.) (Secret.) ^^IOth January, 1925. In reply to your telegram of 8 th nuary,* I have to report that the draft terms of August, 1924, having been communicated to him on 29th September, the Imam replied on 26th October with a query as to whether Government would further discuss some of the terms together with a recon sideration of the draft he despatched on 3rd Zilhijja (3rd July). My reply, on the 15th of November, pointed out the impossibility of reconsideration of a draft on which was based the one approved by Government. Further, 1 maintained that his draft had re ceived the most friendly and fullest consideration. Without allowing further discussion of the draft of the 29th Sep tember, which had been approved by Government, 1 asked him to notify me if any particular words of doubtful meaning could be replaced by others without changing the sense, with a view to expressing more clearly the desire of both Govern ments. I also reiterated the anxiety of Government as well as his own for the completion of the Treaty. On 2nd December the Imam wrote me a somewhat ambiguous letter, which after consultation with the Sultan of Lahej I took to mean that Government’s draft was acceptable to him but that he would prefer Article 3 to bear no reference to the Turks, the right of whose claims to his country he never recognised. Also in Article 4 he would like a limit of time fixed for the receipt of a reply, and his own wording in Articles 6 and 12 he would like restored. • I replied to him on 8 th January in the following terms : — I was aware that he never recognised the Ottoman in his country, and explained that the reference to the Turks in Article 3 was in no way intended to convey the recognition of Ottoman rights, but was for the purpose of describing conveniently the actual frontier, determined by expert officers, that we wished him to recognise, the boundary between the territory administered by him and that of those tribes with whom he had, by the Treaty, promised not to interfere. I suggested this addition to Article 4 :—“ this acknowledgment will be despatched by His Britannic Majesty’s representative within ten days of receipt by him of His Excellency the Imam’s letter of notice.” I suggested that, as he had agreed to the principle embodied in Article 4, the same as that in Article 6 and 12, he should accept Government’s wording with the same addition as I now suggested for Article 4. With reference to the words, included by Government in Article 12 but left out in the Imam’s wording of July, 1924, “ to inaugurate any scheme in any port or place,” I pointed out that30 the British, being essentially a seafaring nation, have, as such, a peculiar knowledge of the requirements of shipping in harbours and ports. The Imam urged the necessity of a gathering of the Chiefs of his tribes so that, to allay suspicion and prevent re-discussion afterwards, he might lay before them the whole matter. While allowing him to be the best judge of the necessity of this, reflected that considerable delay would be the outcome of sue. a gathering. ANNEXURE 5. Imam’s Counter-Draft of Article 3 of the Draft of August, 1924. His Highness the Imam consents to the retention by His Majesty’s Government of the town of Aden so long as friendly relations and treaties are maintained between the two parties. His Highness will similarly consent to the continuance of the present administration in those territories in which it is necessary to safeguard the interests of the Aden Government, on condition that the inhabitants of those territories will always act within the bounds of justice and law, and ensure the freedom and security of communications. His Highness will further help by prevent ing the advance of any armed force to any of those territories (as shown in the list at the end of this Article). As for what is actually occupied by the Imam’s troops, this shall remain in status quo without discussion, but His Highness will have regard for the Chiefs concerned and will compensate them suitably.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government recognise the absolute y^dependence of the Imam in all matters political and administra- ve, internal and external, and his sovereignty in the territories handed down to him (i.e. by inheritance). Nothing in the present Article is to be considered as invalidated by the provisions of Article 2 . Article 2 . His Highness the Imam shall not enter into correspondence or agreement with any Government or individual on any matter prejudicial to His Britannic Majesty’s Government. Similarly His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall not enter into corre spondence or agreement with any Government or individual on any matter prejudicial to the Government of His Highness the Imam. His Highness the Imam will be at liberty to enter into correspondence or agreement with any Government on matters which are not prejudicial to His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment. Article 3. [This Article is identical Tuith the Imam’s counter-draft form ing Annexure 5, and is not reprinted.] Article 4. The fact that the territories referred to in the preceding Article are placed under a particular jurisdiction (such as Aden, which we have allowed to come under the temporary occupation of Great Britain), may not be interpreted as implying any change in their dependence on the Imamate, which remains the original and natural sovereign authority. On the contrary, it will be incumbent on His Britannic Majesty’s Government to compel the Rulers and peoples of those territories to establish good relations with the sovereign authority within two years, while His Britannic Majesty’s Government undertake to abstain from supplying those territories with any arms or other supplies which may cause controversy. The Rulers and Chiefs of those terri tories will be required to rule with justice, while the judges, who must belong to the Shafe'ite persuasion, will be men of tried integrity, to be appointed by the Imam. Further, should those Rulers and Chiefs fail in putting an end to dissensions and blood shed among their tribes, it shall rest with the Imam to take all possible action to restore order and prevent hostilities and destruction. Article 5. His Britannic Majesty’s Government and His Highness the Imam shall each have an official representative in the territory of the other, and each of the two representatives shall have the same rights and privileges as are accorded to the other, such rights and privileges to be agreed upon when the localities at which each representative is to reside will have been fixed.32 Article 6.

Neither Hj^ Britannic Majesty s Government nor His Highness the Ima v shall impose any duty on commercial goods other than the pre scribed transit (land and sea) dues which are known to each Government. If any change is made by either Government in the prescribed dues, they will be bound to inform the other Government of such change immediately. Article 7. His Britannic Majesty’s Government and His Highness the Imam shall each remain absolutely free to impose such duty on goods in their territory as they may wish; but they both under take not to impose higher duties on the goods, of their respective subjects than is imposed on the goods of the subjects of any other Government. Article 8 . His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not interfere in any way in the dominions of His Highness the Imam; while His Highness the Imam declares that he will not permit the interference of any foreign Government in his dominions whether by sale, or mortgage or gift or any other form of ownership. Article 9. In order to achieve the desired peace completely, His Britannic Majesty s Government undertake to refrain from giving neigh bouring Arab chiefs who may be in treaty relations with them (with the exception of those mentioned in Article 3) any aid or assistance or reinforcement. In the event of any of those Chiefs attacking His Highness the Imam, or in the event of any difference arising between His Highness the Imam and any of those Arab Chiefs, it will be incumbent upon His Britannic Majesty s Government to advise and oppose the said Arab Chief with a view to checking his aggression. Should His Highness the Imam desire to construct a railway m Ins dominions and to entrust its construction to a foreign com- pany. u will be open to His Highness to inform His Britannic Majesty s Government of the offers made by foreign companies so that, in the event of British companies wishing to undertake the contract on terms more acceptable, cheaper, and more ex peditious than those of other foreign companies, preference and p onty will be given to them. His Highness the Imam will not place such orders with other than British firms so long as British firms offer the required facilities.

Article 13. All questions arising within Imamic territory between subjects of His Highness the Imam and recognised subjects of His Britannic Majesty will be settled in Imamic courts and in accord ance with Shari'a law. Similarly any claim arising in British territory between subjects of His Britannic Majesty and subjects of His Highness the Imam will be settled in British courts and according to the dictates of justice and of equality before the law.

Record of Proceedings. Preliminary. I arrived at San‘a at midday on Sunday, the 24th January. I was accompanied by Mr. G. Antonins, the .Secretary of the /‘M.ission, and by the following gentlemen in their various opacities: — Lt.-Col. M. C. Lake, as Adviser on local matters. Lt.-Col. M. S. Irani. I.M.S., as Medical Officer. Mr. R. V. Kaikini, Reporter in the Legislative Council, Bombay, as Stenographer. Sheikh Muhammad Salim, of the Aden Residency Office, as Interpreter. Sheikh Yislam Ba-Ruwais, as Transport Officer. There were also four servants in attendance. 2 . I had started from Hodeida on the afternoon of Monday, the 18th January, and proceeded by motor-car to Bajil, where I stayed the night. There we exchanged the motor-car for the mule, which became our only means of locomotion for the rest of the journey. Leaving Bajil early on Tuesday, the 19th, we reached our destination in five stages, spending a night at each of the following places:—‘Obal, Wish Menakha and Matna. Transport, consisting of mules and pack-camels, and an escort of 44 N.C.O’s and men of the Yemen Army, in the charge of Sayyed Muhammad al-Mutah had been supplied by the Imam. The attentions and displays shown to us by officials on the way showed clearly that the Imam had spared no effort to give the Mission a friendly reception. On arrival at San‘a we were taken to the house which had been allotted to us as a residence. Within half an hour the following gentlemen called to welcome the Mis sion on behalf of the Imam : — Sayyid Abdullah ibn Ibrahim, President of the Theological College. Sayyid Ahmad al-Kibsi, ‘Amel of Bilad al-Rus. Raghib Bey, Second Secretary to the Imam. Qadi ‘Abdul-Karim, Third Secretary to the Imam. In conversation with Raghib Bey, I understood that the Imam was anxious to organise a display on the occasion of my first visit, and asked that I should postpone it so as to give time for arrangements to be made. The visit was accordingly fixed for the morning of Tuesday, the 26th January. First Meeting. 3 At 9 a.m. on Tuesday, the 26th. I proceeded to the Palace in the Imam’s car, accompanied by Mr. Antonins and the inter preter. The reception was marked by a certain pomp and a large guard of honour paid the usual compliments. I was shown into a reception-room and, shortly after our arrival, the Ini am came in In attendance upon His Highness were the Oadi Abdullah al-‘Amri, Chief Minister, Sayyid ‘Abdullah ibn Ibrahim and Raghib Bey. After the presentations and a brief exchange ofF 44 greetings, the Royal Warrant was read out by myself and an Arabic translation by the interpreter. The Imam’s reply was then read out by Raghib Bey. Its purport (in brief) was as follows: — “ We note the contents of His Majesty’s letter with ex treme satisfaction and are particularly gratified that His Majesty should have seen fit to send so experienced ana*^ tried a person as yourself. . . . We believe in the fuller manner in the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government towards us and in their desire to recognise the rights and indepen dence of our nation whose existence, for over orte thousand years, has spread itself over all those territories which form its inheritance. . . . You have been invested with wide powers enabling you to establish our clear rights, and we confidently hope you will be successful in your mission. We believe that an Agreement between us will pave the way for friendly sentiments in the Yemen towards Great Britain. . . . . We extend to you a more cordial welcome than is dictated by official custom. . . .” The reading of the Imam’s reply was followed by a further exchange of amenities, and the Imam thereupon withdrew, leaving us to exchange informal conversation and partake of refreshments with the members of his suite. Second Meeting. 4. The second meeting took place at 9 a.m. on Thursday, the 28th January. I had previously asked the Imam’s leave to present to him the other senior members of my party, Lt.-Col. Lake and Lt.-Col. Irani. Accordingly, they accompanied me and were for mally presented to the Imam, who said a few suitable words of welcome to each, after which they retired. I was then informed by Raghib Bey that the Imam had expressed a desire that the opening of the negotiations, which was due to take place at once, should be attended by the Imam, myself and Mr. Antonius, to the exclusion of anyone else. Thereupon everyone withdrew, and the three of us were left alone. 5. The Imam opened the conversation by stating that he con fidently hoped that our discussions would be fruitful, and that he believed that the question at issue was a simple one. It resolved itself into a question of mere justice. The independence of the Yemen throughout the ages was a patent fact, more especially since the country had, some 1,060 years ago, fallen to the lot of the present ruling House. It was true that the Turks had occu pied it and that they had behaved as if they were masters of it. But it was equally true that the people had always resented and opposed the Turkish usurpation and that on three separate occa sions the Turks had been driven out with great loss. He wished to appeal to my sense of justice, and he had no doubt that, thanks to the very wide powers with which I was invested, I should be able to conclude an agreement based on an impartial recog- nition of those rights which, in the view of all those who knew the history of the Yemen during the last 1,000 years, must be held to be clear and indisputable. He wished also to ask that f f45 I should give special consideration to his own position towards his subjects, and hoped that the demands of the British Govern ment might be confined to matters which would be acceptable to his people. He concluded by saying that, from what he had heard of my record, he looked upon me as a person who had had con siderable experience of, and was sympathetically inclined towards, Arab peoples; and that he wished me to consider the ques- ons at issue with the eyes of an impartial arbiter and a friend. 6 . I replied by thanking His Highness for his kind references to me, and by expressing the belief that, since he had placed the discussion on such a plane of friendship and goodwill, agreement would be considerably facilitated. I then pointed out, with reference to His Highness’s remarks about my powers, that, although these were wide, they were governed by a policy which His Majesty’s Government had laid down after very careful con sideration. With regard to independence, I assured the Imam that there was no question of His Majesty’s Government not recognising him as a fully independent ruler. The mere fact of their sending an envoy armed with such powers as those which I possessed showed clearly that they looked upon him as the ruler of an independent country. Moreover, the Draft Treaty which had been communicated to him contained specific recog nition of his independence. 1 added that, if the proposed 1 reaty were to be signed, similar recognition by other Powers would be facilitated, and His Majesty’s Government would no doubt give the Yemen every possible assistance towards securing the tangible results of such recognition in regard to postal and tele graphic communication and like matters of international import. 7. The Imam replied that he was much gratified to hear my assurance. The whole question, he repeated, was one of justice and fair treatment. He would ask me to look upon his country as an ailing body and on myself as its physician, and he was will ing to leave it to me, to my knowledge and sense of justice, to apply the proper remedy. He would suggest that 1 should consider the matter afresh in that light, and let him know in a day or two the conclusion to which I would come. He urged that the question of the protected tribes was one which could best be settled by a frank admission of the Imam's rights over them. 8 . I replied that I was much fiattered by the trust which His Highness seemed to place in me, but that I should be doing him a disservice if I accepted his suggestion and left him with the impression that the Draft Treaty was liable to radical revision. It would not be right to raise false hopes. The draft was the outcome of long negotiations and represented the con sidered policy of His Majesty’s Government. Like all drafts, it was liable to certain modification; but there were two points of principle which could not be abandoned. These were the Pro tectorate Boundary and the Protectorate Treaties. His High ness had said that the question of the tribes could best be settled by allowing him to extend his rule over them. In saying this he overlooked the fact that His Majesty’s Government had certain definite obligations towards those tribes, which they felt found to honour.46 9. The Imam said that he fully appreciated the point, and he believed the honouring of pledges to be a sacred duty. He believed this in spite of the fact that Great Britain had found it possible to establish the Jews in an Arab country, contrary to Arab wishes and in the teeth of previous pledges solemnly made to the Arabs. But he did not wish to press that point. All he wished to say now was that he requested me earnestly to tre^ him as a friend and to examine the whole question with the eyes an impartial arbiter who had the interests of both parties at heart. 10 . In my reply 1 thought it preferable to ignore the Imam’s reference to Palestine, and contented myself with a general state ment about the position and interests of Great Britain in the Red Sea, emphasising the fact that His Majesty’s Government were not moved by any desire of acquisition, and hinting that His High ness was sagacious enough to recognise the importance to his country of friendship with Great Britain. 1 added that I looked upon my Mission as one in which it was my duty to consider His Highness’s interests as well as those of my country. 11 . His Highness then thanked me and asked me to name a time for another meeting. 1 said that I was at his disposal and that, were it not Friday, 1 should have suggested a meeting on the following day. The Imam said that he would prefer Saturday morning at the same hour, and 1 thereupon took my leave. Third Meeting. 12 . The third meeting took place at 9 a.m. on Saturday, the 30th January. 1 was accompanied by Mr. Antonins, while the Imam had Raghib Bey in attendance throughout the interview. The Imam began by asking me whether I had considered matters and could give him the result of my examination. He jokingly added that he and his country were invalids and that he looked upon me as the physician who could cure their ailments. In reply 1 said that further consideration had further convinced me that it lay with the Imam himself to take the step which, by leading to the conclusion of an Agreement, would establish the relations of the two countries on a peaceful and a friendly footing. I reiterated my previous statement that the Draft of August, 1924*, represented the considered policy of His Majesty’s Government, and made it clear, once more, that it was based on principles which Great Britain had every intention to uphold. I went on to say that, in considering whether or not to conclude the proposed Agreement, His Highness was surely aware that the choice before him lay between a continuation of the present unsatis factory state of affairs, possibly aggravated by a rupture, and a state of affairs in which, while retaining his independence, he would gain the friendship and the help of Great Britain and strengthen and improve conditions in his country. 13. The Imam replied by expressing his satisfaction with what he understood to lie the intentions of His Majesty’s Government towards him, and then followed a somewhat long and diffuse dis course, interlarded with a flow of compliments, which left no doubt in my mind that it was not His Highness’s intention at this meeting to embark upo n a business-like discussion of the ques- * Annexure 2.47 tions at issue, and that he was only continuing the process of sounding me. I therefore asked him what proposal he had to make for the opening of negotiations on the specific points, and he replied by asking me whether 1 would agree to appoint a dele gate on my part, and name one to represent him (the Imam) for the purpose of examining the question in committee. I replied iiaming Mr. Antonins as my representative, but declined to sug- .“'^st who the Imam’s delegate should be. His Highness said that he would consider the choice of his own representative later and would let me know. 14. When the Imam had withdrawn, I asked Raghib Bey to inform him that Mr. Antonins would be ready to meet His High ness’s representative as soon as was agreeable to him. In spite of my hint, however, the gentlemen appointed by the Imam did not present themselves till two days later. Fourth Meeting. 15. The Imam’s delegates were three in number: — Sayyid ‘Abdullah ibn Ibrahim, Oadi ‘Abdullah al-‘Amri, and Raghib Bey, and the fourth meeting was held in our house at 9 a.m. on Mon day, the 1st February. I opened the meeting with a few words of welcome and then said that I proposed to leave these gentlemen to discuss matters with Mr. Antonius, who was fully conversant with my views and with the facts of the case, and would be able to conduct the con versation in Arabic, a great saving in time. Thereupon, I with drew, adding that I should be in the house in case the necessity for reference arose. Subsequently, Mr. Antonius submitted the following report of the conversation which had taken place: — Report by Mr. Antonins. 16. The meeting lasted two hours. Sayyid ‘Abdullah opened the proceedings by a long discourse in which he repeated the familiar arguments relating to the Imam’s historical rights. I replied to the effect that the question immediately before us was whether the Imam was prepared, in principle, to come to terms on the basis provided by the Draft of August, 1924*. I said that the Draft represented the considered policy of His Majesty’s Government and rested on principles which they had no intention of abandoning. In spite of the fact that the Draft had been presented some sixteen months ago, no definite expression of opinion had been received from the Imam with regard to its contents. The first step, therefore, seemed to me to find out what and where the differences were, and I suggested that this could best be done by taking the Draft and examining it together in committee, point by point. To this the Oadi ‘Abdullah replied that it would be preferable to negotiate without the Draft so that we might approach the question with a clear vision. He went on to say that the points of difference were not numerous, and he hoped that agreement could be reached notwithstanding those differences. From the Imam’s point of view, the question was a very simple one of justice and truth. All that he asked for was * Annexure 2.48 the due recognition of his ancient rights over the whole of the Yemen, including Aden. if only this were recognised, he would he prepared to concede various points which now formed a stumbling-block to agreement. 17. I replied by suggesting that we should concentrate on the facts rather than on the historical rights or wrongs of the case. I said that I did not think it profitable to embark upon a c&lt;^^ troversy about the historical side of the question, but that i begged them to consider, rather, the hard facts of the situation. Then 1 spoke about Great Britain’s position at Aden and her obligations towards the tribes in the Aden Protectorate. I added that these were two facts which for practical purposes had as much value as volumes of historical arguments, because they were concrete facts which no one could overlook. And I pointed out that the Draft of August, 1924, did not ask the Imam to do more than recognise what every observer could see for himself, namely, the necessity of facing those two facts. I begged of them to think this over and to believe that there was nothing in the intentions of the British Government that contained any but the most friendly intentions towards the Yemen and the pros perity of its people. I also impressed upon them the advisability, since they could not obtain all their demands at once, of content ing themselves with what they could obtain, leaving it to time and to their friendship with Great Britain to bring about a fuller realisation of their aspirations. Finally, I pointed out to them that the choice before them lay between the conclusion of an agreement with all the tangible benefits that would accrue to their country, and between a rupture of negotiations with all the unfor tunate consequences that that might entail. 18. Sayyid “Abdullah replied by saying that my statement had given them additional reason to believe in the good intentions of the Mission, and that he would like to think matters over with his colleagues. The meeting then adjourned until the following day. G. A. Fifth Meeting. {Report by Mr. Antonius.) 19. 'The fifth meeting took place at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, the 2 nd February, and was attended by the three delegates and myself. Sayyid ‘Abdullah made a statement of a general nature in which he said that he and his colleagues had considered the subject of yesterday’s conversation very carefully and had discussed it with the Imam. They were authorised by the Imam to say that he had every confidence in the intentions of the Mission and that he looked to the Mission to devise some form of agreement which might reconcile the conflicting demands of both parties. The Qadi ‘Abdullah then added that the Yemen was an invalid and the Mission the physician to whom the country looked for a cure. I was then invited to make a statement. 20 . It seemed clear by that time that the line of conduct of these gentlemen, wherein they probably took their cue from the Imam, was to avoid showing their hand and continue the process __49 of sounding us. Even when questioned directly, their answers were enveloped in an opaque tissue of polite generalities that lacked any tangible meaning. It appeared necessary, therefore, at this stage to press effectively for a clear expression of opinion on their part. 21. I said that the Imam had already referred to the Mission the physician for the country’s ailments, and this was a distinc tion which was very flattering to the Mission. At the same time, I could not help noticing that the invalid Yemen had not only refused the prescription prepared for him in the shape of the Draft of August, 1924, but had also failed to explain his objec tions to it. I added that if they persisted in not formulating their objections on specific points, I failed to see how any progress could be made. I pressed them to consider the Draft Treaty point by point and to indicate their objections wherever they lay. The Qadi ‘Abdullah replied that they would do so and would communicate with me on some future date. T answeied that there was no need for postponement, since I had a copy °f the Draft at hand. This was brought out and when the Qadi ‘Abdullah had read it out aloud, slowly and.deliberately, discus sion began. 22. By common agreement, Article 3 was taken first, and for the remaining hour the discussion centred round its contents. The delegates were of opinion that this Article meant the signing away of the Imam’s rights to the Southern Yemen m perpetuity. I held that it contained the minimum that would satisfy the principles laid down as fixed by the British (government, an endeavoured to lead the discussion along the lines of seeking some other wording which might be acceptable to the delegates. At length, the latter said that they would consider the wording by themselves and prepare a counter-draft which they would bring on the following day. Thereupon, the meeting came to an end (12.15 p.m.). r . Sixth Meeting. (Report by Mr. Antonins.) 23 The sixth meeting was held at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, the 3rd February, and was attended by the three delegates and myselb On mv asking- for the promised counter-draft, Sayyid Abdulla said that lie had spent a long time with this colleagues on the previous* day searching for a XfhaTthL^re points of view, but without success; and that they had therefore decided°to ask’ the Mission who had so ' 1 ^%more exper,e„ce t i ian they had to provide the required draft. This seemed onl&gt; ano’ther^illustration of the policy of ^-ion and I r b , asking- firmly for the counter-draft. The delegates consuuea among themselves, and then said that they would there and then prepare their counter-draft. 24 \fter half an hour of whispered discussion, which took p ac. while I sat on one side, the delegates handed me them counter- draft to Article 3. Its terms will be found m Yi TTsatisfaction 1 had read it, one of the delegates expressed h.s satisfaction50 that a formula had at last been found which satisfied the two points of view. Thereupon I said that I had not intended to express an opinion without reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton first, but that since such astonishing optimism had been expressed, I felt bound to say there and then that, in my own opinion, the counter-draft before us was unacceptable and did not even provide a basis for discussion. I asked them, however, to await a hnaljg^ opinion after reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton and I requested that, in the meanwhile, they should prepare a complete counter-draft of the whole treaty, so that their opinion might be placed on record. The meeting then rose (10.30 a.m.). G. A. Seventh Meeting. 2 o. The seventh meeting was held on Saturday, the 6 th February, and, as Mr. Antonins was unfortunately ill with an attack of fever, I received the Imam’s representatives myself, Sheikh Muhammad Salim being present as interpreter, t opened the proceedings by stating that Mr. Antonins had informed me of the result of theij previous discussions and that the attitude which he had taken up was fully in accordance with my views. I further informed the representatives that I was unable to accept the draft of Article 3 which they had submitted to Mr. Antonins at the last meeting and that I had hoped that, after three days’ deliberation, they would be in a position to put forward proposals which would form a basis for discussion. 26. Qadi ‘Abdullah then made a long and rambling speech, in which he repeated much of what he had already said to Mr. Antonius at the previous meetings. He was followed by Sayyid ‘Abdullah ibn Ibrahim who spoke in a similar strain, but who also failed to produce anything in the shape of concrete proposals or even suggestions. 27. I felt that these vague generalities were probably a prelude to something more definite and my surmise was proved correct when, at the conclusion of Sayyid ‘Abdullah’s discourse, the Qadi produced a document which he informed me contained their counter-draft of a complete treaty (Annexure 6 ). 28. I did not read or discuss this document at the time, but informed them that I would consider it carefully and discuss it with the Imam himself. I then closed the meeting by giving them a brief statement of the principles which His Majesty’s Government had instructed me to maintain and on which any agreement must be based, expressing the hope that the terms of their counter-draft would not prove to be incompatible with those principles or differ materially from the Draft of August, 1924, which had already received the considered approval of His Majesty’s Government. Eighth Meeting. 29. The eighth meeting was held at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, the 9th February. There were present the Imam, Raghib Bey, Mr. Antonius and myself. I opened the proceed ings by informing His Highness that the counter-draft presentedi 'i 51 by his delegates on the previous Saturday, far from meeting the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in a practical manner, had shown that there was a wide divergence between the two points of view. I regretted to have to say that it did not even provide a basis for discussion. That was why 1 had interrupted the con ferences with his delegates and had asked for an interview with ^/•■yHis Highness himself. It was my painful duty to inform His Highness that I could not see my way to any agreement, if that counter-draft really did represent his considered reply, and that 1 must reluctantly take my leave. 30. The Imam replied at some length and with a certain dis play of concern, and begged me to explain to him in what par ticulars he could amend his attihide so as to make it fall in with the views of His Majesty’s Government. He reiterated his pro found desire for a treaty of friendship and his conviction that there were no insuperable difficulties in the w r ay of our concluding such a treaty. All that he would ask was that due regard be had to his position among his subjects. There was a considerable and powerful public opinion in his country, and there was a deeply-ingrained belief among his subjects that the Aden Pro tectorate was an integral part of the Yemen. His Highness argued that he could not possibly go beyond a certain point against that current. He would go as far as he could, and he would willingly sign and respect a treaty of friendship and peace; but to sign away the rights of the Yemen to portions which his people looked upon as of their inheritance was a thing wdiich he could not and would not do. He concluded by appealing to me to consider the matter again and to try to find some means of reconciling the two points of view. He was confident that, since both sides w r ere anxious for a friendly settlement, it ought to be' possible to come to some understanding. 31. I replied that since blis Highness had expressed himself so warmly in favour of an agreement, I could only hope that some agreement would result. But the only possible way would be by discarding the counter-draft presented on his behalf by his dele gates, and accepting, as a basis for agreement, the draft presented by His Majesty’s Government. I added that in deference to His Highness’s request I would again review the whole situation and endeavour to suggest a practical solution within the next twenty- four hours. His Highness depressed his gratitude and a meeting was fixed for the foliowing day. 32. I then referred to the subject of our departure and asked His Highness whether he would kindly give the necessary orders to enable us to leave by the beginning of the coining week. I pointed out that, whatever the outcome of our further delibera tions, whether or not an agreement was concluded, we ought to be in a position to leave in a few days. I also asked him whether he had any objection to our returning to Aden by the overland route. His Highness replied that he had no objection whatever, and that he would give all the necessary orders. Our departure was then fixed for Monday, the 15th February. -*«s52 Ninth Meeting. 33 . The ninth meeting took place at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, the 10th February. There were present the Imam, Raghib Bey, Mr. Antonins and myself. I made a statement in which T informed the Imam that, after a very careful review of the position, I had drawn up an alternative draft which went a long way towards meeting the wishes he had expressed at yester-JJfe day’s meeting, in that it specifically reserved for future settle ment his claims to suzerainty over certain territories, without, however, admitting their validity in any way. I then asked Mr. Antonins to read out an Arabic translation of my proposal (see Annexure 7). After a short conversation, in which I explained to the Imam that this draft was to be considered as my final offer, to be accepted or rejected without further discussion of the prin ciple embodied in it, I took my leave on the understanding that another meeting was to be held on the following day at which His Highness would give me his reply. Tenth Meeting. 34 . The tenth meeting was held at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Thursday, the 11th February, with the same attendance as pre viously. The Imam stated that he had read my last draft and that he considered that, in principle, it met the case. He had, however, two observations to make. In the first place, he would prefer the clause about evacuation to be removed from the Treaty and to form the subject of a separate understanding. He would ask for this only in case the proposed Treaty were likely to be published; but if it were to remain a secret treaty, then the clause might be retained in its place. The second point was that he felt unable to evacuate the Dhala region. He argued that the feeling in the country made it out of the question for him to give it up after five years of occupation during which the administration had been organised on permanent lines, order had been restored to a degree unknown before in the history of Dhala, and the people of that region were unanimous in wishing him to remain. On the other hand, he was prepared to consider the rights of the Amir of Dhala, who had a treaty with His Majesty’s Government, and he was willing to reinstate him in his Amirate and restore his former prerogatives as far as possible. 35. I replied that, with regard to the question of publicity, there would be no objection to removing the clause relating to evacua tion from the body of the Treaty and making it the subject of a separate undertaking. But with regard to the Dhala region, I pointed out to the Imam that non-evacuation would be a breach of one of the principles laid down as fixed by His Majesty’s Government, namely, withdrawal from the Protectorate, and that I could not consent to it. A discussion ensued, and at length it was agreed that the work of drawing up a joint draft for sig nature should proceed at once, while I would have a further meeting with PI is Highness on the subject of Dhala on the follow ing Saturday. I then asked the Imam to arrange for his repre sentatives to meet Mr. Antonins as soon as possible so that the work of drafting might begin without delay, and suggested also53 that, although the next day was a Friday, the task should proceed without interruption. His Highness agreed and said that he would send his representatives in the afternoon, and I thereupon took my leave. Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Meetings. {Report by Mr. Antonins.) W 36. The subsequent three meetings took place in the afternoon of Thursday, the 11 th February, the morning of Friday, the 12 th and on Saturday, the 13th. They were attended by the three former delegates with the addition of the Qadi ‘Abdul-Karim. The primary object of those discussions was to draw up a new draft treaty based on the offer made by Sir Gilbert Clayton to the Imam. I suggested that the best procedure would be to take the Draft of August, 1924:, clause by clause, and consider what amendments would be required to bring it into line with the principle of the offer. This was opposed by all the delegates in unison, but after some discussion the suggestion was adopted. 37. The principal obstacle to progress lay in the insistence of the delegates on obtaining some kind of acknowledgment of the Imam’s suzerainty over the Protectorate. They reiterated the usual historical justification of their claim and laid stress on the fact that the Yemen had never accepted Turkish rule and could not recognise any of the obligations incurred by the Ottoman Government as binding on the Imam. They declared that, in their opinion, Aden and its hinterland belonged to the Yemen, and that they could not consent to any treaty that did not contain some more or less explicit recognition of that fact. 38. As will be seen, the attitude of the delegates was even more difficult to reconcile with the views of His Majesty’s Government than that of the Imam himself, and called for a clear and un equivocal statement of the position. I told these gentlemen that I was surprised, after the liberal offer made by Sir Gilbert Clay ton and its acceptance by the Imam, to hear them advance such claims. I explained to them, in as temperate a wording as I could find, the futility of their extending their claims to Aden. I also thought it necessary to try and restore their argument regarding the invalidity of obligations incurred by the Ottoman Government to a more exact perspective. I pointed out that, while it was recognised that the Yemen had always resented and opposed Turkish domination, it was equally true that the in habitants of the country had accepted to elect deputies to repre sent them in Constantinople, and that members of the leading families of the Yemen* who had been thus elected, had not ab stained from taking their seats in the Ottoman Chamber on exactly the same footing as other representatives of vilayets of the Ottoman Empire. The argument that the Turks were never recognised in the Yemen was therefore one which could not be pressed beyond a certain point. I ended by appealing to the delegates to approach the questions at issue from the more prac * Among those was Sayyid 'Abdullah ibn Ibrahim who had been returned twice as a deputy lor the Yemen.54 tical point of view of how best to devise an agreement based on the principle suggested by Sir Gilbert Clayton and accepted by the Imam. 39. The discussions occupied three long sittings and resulted in a certain measure of agreement being reached and a draft prepared. A few of the outstanding points were reserved by the delegates for reference to the Imam, and it was agreed th^w^ the next step would be for Sir Gilbert Clayton and the Imam t hold a meeting for the liquidation of those differences. G. A. Fourteenth Meeting. 40. The fourteenth meeting was held at the Palace on Sunday, the 14th February, with the same attendance as previously, namely, the Imam, Raghib Bey, Mr. Antonins and myself. I informed the Imam that Mr. Antonius had had long discussions with his delegates during the previous three days and had even tually come to agreement in regard to a draft of the Treaty with the exception of a few points which they had decided it was necessary to defer for discussion between His Highness and myself. I should, therefore, be glad to go through those points with him and endeavour to come to a settlement in regard to them. Two or three of the points, which were not of particular importance, were satisfactorily settled, and we then came to the sentence in Article 4 in which the Imam agreed to recognise the Protectorate Treaties. This question gave rise to a long discussion and the Imam still maintained that it was not possible for him to recognise treaties which had been made at a time when he was unable to exert those rights that he claimed to be his. I maintained, however, that I could not admit any wording which would place in doubt the position of Great Britain in regard to the tribes with which she held these treaties, and I begged that His Highness would think over the question very carefully and see whether he could not find a way of meeting my views. 41. The next question on which a serious difference of opinion arose was that of the language in which the Treaty should be concluded. I had proposed that it should be drawn up in English and in Arabic and that both versions would have equal validity, but that in case of any difference arising the English version would prevail. The Imam expressed himself with some vehemence as entirely unable to subscribe to this proposal as he must refuse quite definitely to put his name to any document which was written in a language which he did not understand. He urged that Arabic should be the only text, in view of the fact that there were no persons in the Yemen who were suffi ciently conversant with English to enable them to appreciate the meaning of an English version. I informed His Highness that this was an important point on which I could not give way to his views, but that I would consider it carefully and see whether any compromise was possible. 42. The other points raised were those concerning two articles which the Imam’s representative had wished to insert, the first emphasising the independence of the Yemen by enumerating anumber of spheres of action in which the Imam would be free to do as he liked, and the second stating that Great Britain would undertake to assist the Imam in the matter of the repair of the submarine cable between Sheikh Sa'id and Perim. After some discussion the Imam agreed to leave out both these articles, as I pointed out to him that the first one was unnecessary and ^^/ould only make the Treaty cumbrous and overloaded, while the second one was a matter which could more suitably be arranged by correspondence between the two Governments. Fifteenth Meeting. 43. The fifteenth meeting was held at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Monday, the 15th February, the attendance being as usual. The previous evening I had received a complete draft treaty from the Imam, which purported to embody all the points on which agree ment had been arrived at up to date, not only in the course of my meetings with His Highness but also during the lengthy dis cussions which Mr. Antonius had carried out with the Imam’s representatives. On studying this draft I had discovered that it was entirely unacceptable. No note had been taken whatso ever of many important points on which agreement had been arrived at, and the draft as a whole was scarcely different to that which had been submitted previously and which had been held to be entirely unacceptable and not susceptible even of discussion. I decided, however, to ignore this draft altogether and to carry on discussions from the point at which we had left off at the previous meeting. 44. This course of action proved successful in that the new draft did not come directly under discussion throughout the meeting. We continued the discussion of the draft of Article 4, on which no agreement had been arrived at on the previous day, and after some argument and the submission by the Imam him self of various formulae in an endeavour to meet both points of view, we eventually reached a stage at which I considered that it would be possible for me to put up a final draft representing my last word in the matter. I had taken the opportunity during the conversation of making it quite clear to the Imam that I could not admit any wording which would throw doubt on, or in any way weaken, ihe position of His Majesty s Government in regard to the Aden Protectorate; I had gone as far as to agree to a reservation of the question of His Highness’s claims for future discussion without prejudice to the standpoint of eithei party but I could not agree to any wording which would cast the slightest doubt on the present position of Great Britain. ^ Tht Imam again wished to insert the clause emphasising in detail the independence of the Yemen, and I informed him that, though I did not consider it in itself objectionable, it appeared to me awkward and superfluous. 45 The Imam then requested that a clause should be inserted in the Treaty by which His Majesty’s Government would under take to punish, and exact due reparation from, tribes who com mitted aggression into his territory from the Aden side of the boundary. He urged that if he was precluded from retaliationr His Majesty’s Government should take the responsibility of con trolling and punishing their offending tribes. The argument was a fair one and I agreed to consider the framing of a clause which would meet the case. 46. Finally, we discussed the question of the language in which the Treaty should be concluded, and I proposed that it should be drawn up in parallel columns of English and Arabic an'^s* that His Highness should sign below the Arabic column, Mr. ' Antonius adding a certificate to the effect that the two texts were, as far as it was possible to make them, identical. The Imam appeared satisfied with this arrangement, and the meeting then came to an end, having lasted over three hours. Sixteenth Meeting. 47. The sixteenth meeting was held at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Thursday, the 18th February. I was accompanied by Mr. Antonius, while the Imam had Raghib Bey in attendance. In the interval between the fifteenth meeting and this, I had pre sented His Highness with a fresh draft of the proposed Treaty (see Annexure 9). The conversation which took place at this meeting is fully summarised in paragraphs 30-32 of my report. Seventeenth Meeting. 48. The seventeenth meeting was held at the Palace at 9 a.m. on Saturday, the 20 th February, with the same attendance as pre viously. A full account of the conversation which took place will be found in paragraphs 34-36 of my report. Eighteenth Meeting. 49. The eighteenth and last meeting was held at the Palace at 10 a.m. on Sunday, the 21st February, when I went to take formal leave of the Imam. I was accompanied by Mr. Antonius, and was received by His Highness with even greater ceremony than on my arrival. Throughout the interview, the Imam main tained an attitude of the greatest cordiality, and expressed the hope that negotiations would be resumed eventually. A sum mary of the interview will be found in paragraph 37 of my report. C.8875/26. No. 2. 6 zV Gilbert Clayton, K.C .M.G., &amp;c., to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sir London, 6 th April, 1926. I have the honour in connection with my report, dated 6 th April, 1926,* on the results of my recent mission to San‘a, to sub mit a memorandum on the subject of the Aden Protectorate. The memorandum was drawn up at a time when I thought it possible that an agreement with the Imam might be concluded, but failure to achieve that agreement has not altered my views in regard to the general situation. J \ .It is true that the attitude which the Imam has taken up has, for the time being, complicated the situation, and it may well be that His Majesty’s Government will decide that no other course remains open than that of expelling him from the Protectorate by force. At the same time, I regard this as merely a passing phase. I •believe that fhe Imam is in reality sincerely desirous of establish- ing^ friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government but that various factors, which time and experience should remove, have forced him to assume an attitude which has made it impossible for me to conclude a satisfactory agreement with him at the present stage. It must be remembered that the Yemen is unique in that many of its people are highly intelligent and educated in a certain sense, while at the same time their country has re mained for centuries so remote and secluded from the world that arguments which seem obvious to the ordinary mind cannot enter into the comprehension of men who have never travelled more than a few miles from San‘a itself. Further, the military ex perience of the people of the Yemen is confined to constant revolt against the Turkish Empire, which was on the whole, and some times very strikingly, successful; an ultimately victorious cam paign against the Idrisi of Asir; and a not unfruitful policy of aggression and encroachment on the Aden Protectorate, which is held by a power which they have seen apparently penned within the limits of the fortress of Aden for something like five years by a small and poorly equipped Turkish force. Add to this the pride engendered by many centuries of domination which, though subject to various changes of fortune, has nevertheless been con tinuous, and it is not difficult to understand why the Imam has— I believe against his better judgment—been forced by public opinion to adopt an attitude which has rendered difficult for the moment the conclusion of any agreement compatible with British honour and prestige. I am convinced that, despite the present difficulties and com plications of what, as I have already said, I regard as a passing- phase, the sound policy in the long run will be to aim at friendship and close co-operation with the Imamate of the Yemen, which is one of the few societies in Arabia which is proved by history to contain the elements of stability. The immediate situation is full of difficulty and it is not easy to see how the Imam can be brought to his senses other than by a display of determination, or even of force, on the part of His Majesty’s Govemment, but I am constrained to urge that the ultimate aim should be to establish dose and cordial relations with an institution which has behind it a tradition of some 1,000 years and which shows no sign, as far as I can see, of disin tegration or decay. I have, &amp;c., GILBERT CLAYTON.5* Memorandum. An examination of the situation in the, Aden Protectorate leads to the conclusion that a policy which was formulated in the early part of the last century, when conditions were very different, no longer meets the needs of the situation. On the contrary, it entails responsibilities, which it is impossible to discharge-^ adequately in existing conditions without increased military anr administrative expenditure. 2 . The Aden Protectorate is approximately enclosed between a line running north-east from a point on the coast opposite the island of Perim and the south-eastern coast line of Arabia, the base of the triangle being closed, as far as the Yemen is con cerned, by the uninhabited desert of the Rub ‘el Khali. Apart from a limited area round Aden itself, which is definitely in British possession and under direct British administration, the Protectorate is divided into nine main divisions, and it is only on the paramount Chiefs of these divisions, all of whom draw stipends from His Majesty’s Government, that the authorities at Aden can rely for the control and direction of the tribes. The resources at the disposal of the Resident at Aden preclude any other course of action, and in theory the policy may appear based on sound principles. In practice, however, it is unworkable and Yunproductive. Each division or tribe is sub-divided into many smaller tribes, whose allegiance to the paramount Chief is fre quently only nominal and often non-existent, influenced as it is by the personal character and ability of the paramount Chief him self and the ever-changing circumstances of tribal feud and in trigue. This is especially the case in the northern districts bordering on the Yemen frontier, some of which are distant as far as 200 miles from Aden, where British control is entirely unfelt and where each tribe and sub-tribe is practically a law unto itself. 3. In these conditions it is not easy to see how the responsi bilities for the preservation of law, order and defence which are implied by the existence of the Protectorate are to be discharged adequately without a permanent, and perhaps increasing, exten sion of administrative and military activity. 4. It has been urged that the Protectorate, as it now exists, is an important factor in the defence of Aden; that it interposes a buffer against any hostile attack by land; and that it ensures timely warning of such an attack. There is some force in these arguments, but the advantages which they claim hardly com pensate for the embarrassment and even danger which is threatened by a continuance of the present state of affairs. The frontier tribes lack cohesion and have no particular incentive, other than the passing inclination or advantage of the moment, to remain loyal. They would be quite unable as at present organised to combine to resist any serious attack and would without doubt, and very naturally, adopt an opportunist policy, as was the case when the Turks attacked Aden in 1915. If these military advantages are to be secured, it can only be by establish ing real control over the tribes and having such a force at Aden59 as will show them clearly which side it is to their advantage to take. As regards the receipt of timely warning of any projected attack, the normal relations between the tribesmen and Aden, which is the commercial centre of the whole of that part of the country, should always be such as to enable an efficient Intelli gence Service to procure all the information it requires. 5- There remains the argument that Great Britain is bound *^*^0 the tribes by treaty obligations which cannot in honour be disregarded. This is perfectly true, and it is for this reason that it was essential to insist that the Imam should formally recognise those treaties and respect the boundaries of the present Protectorate. It is submitted, however, that it is not necessary that these tribal treaties should be continued indefinitely, despite all changes in circumstances and conditions. 6 . The treaties with the more important chiefs, such as the Sultans along the coast and especially the Abdali Sultan of Lahei, are of long standing and their relations with His Majesty’s Government through the Resident at Aden have been close and on the whole satisfactory. 7. The Protectorate Treaties with the tribes in the northern mountainous portions of the Protectorate, however, are almost without exception of the simplest possible nature and have the disadvantage that they throw all the obligations on to His Majesty’s Government with, as far as can be seen, little or no compensating benefit. They usually contain four material clauses only: the first extending the protection of His Majesty’s Government, with its consequent burden of responsibility and possible future commitment; the second and third binding the tribe not to enter into relations with, or cede, mortgage, lease, hire or give any of their territory to any foreign power; and the fourth requiring the tribe concerned to maintain security on the roads in return for a small monthly stipend. 8 . The reasons for the provisions of the second and third articles in the case of coastal tribes are evident, but their force in the case of the mountain tribes in the interior is not apparent; moreover, should the tribes in question fall eventually under the rule of the Imam of the Yemen, the case could be covered by a suitable article in a treaty made with him. 9. The provisions contained in the fourth clause are self-con tained and independent of . the remaining articles of the instru ments, being merely a statement of the payment to be made for services rendered. 10 . In the light of the above observations, I venture to urge that a comprehensive reconsideration of policy in regard to the Aden Protectorate is a matter of urgent necessity. 11 . Whatever the limit placed to the area of the Aden Protec torate, measures must be taken to increase the administrative and financial resources at the disposal of the Aden authorities to an extent which will enable them to exercise such a measure of control and direction over the tribes as will ensure the main tenance of law and order, and secure the defence of the frontier by promoting real cohesion and solidarity among tribes who are at present lawless, isolated and riddled with local dissension and intrigue. This policy may in the end approach very nearly to annexation and direct administration, and the expense entailed will be in a proportion to the size of the Protectorate.6o 12 . If it is decided to adopt a policy by which the Protectorate is contracted to the narrowest limits consistent with treaty obliga tions and long-standing connexions, military necessities and the capacity for proper and economical administration, then no time should be lost in formulating that policy and deciding on the methods to be employed for carrying it into effect. In any case, I venture to suggest that the first step should be a careful review of all the Protectorate treaties and of our past relations with^^^ the various tribes. On the basis of the results obtained from this examination, and taking due note of military, administrative and financial requirements, it should be possible to form a general idea of what limit to the Protectorate is essential. It will then, I submit, be necessary to fix a limit to the term of all the Pro tectorate Treaties, or at least to all those which will not indubitably fall within the revised boundary of the Protectorate. 13. The tribes will then know exactly how they stand and it will be for them, either to coalesce and form a responsible body with which His Majesty’s Government can reasonably enter into discussions regarding revised agreements, or to see their treaties lapse at the expiry of the fixed period. 14. It will, perhaps, be argued that the result will be that those tribes who drop out of the Protectorate will fall under the rule of the Imam of the Yemen. Provided really friendly rela tions can be established with the Imam, I see no grave objection to this consummation. On the contrary, it presents many ad vantages. The tribes are unlikely to do otherwise than benefit by being under a ruler of undoubted authority and one who—as far as I have been able to observe—is comparatively enlightened and desirous of promoting the prosperity of his country; more over, arrangements should be possible by which the Imam would undertake to preserve the interests of ruling chiefs. 15. The embarrassment, even menace, to Aden from a ruler in the Yemen who is nursing a perpetual grievance at being deprived of territory which he considers is his by right of history, and who has every opportunity of stirring up trouble among tribes over whom British control is either slender or non-existent, is greater than that from one with whom His Majesty’s Govern ment is on friendly terms and who is bound to Great Britain by a treaty; and who has a long tradition behind him and a considerable measure of control and authority over his tribes and who can, therefore, be held responsible for their misdeeds; and who, in the last resort, can be coerced with the minimum ex penditure of men and money by naval action against his ports on the Red Sea, and by air action from Aden and Kamaran. 16. I suggest that, if the Imam of the Yemen will show a real desire to meet the requirements of His Majesty’s Govern ment and to enter into amicable relations, it will be sound policy to cultivate his friendship, even at a certain sacrifice, and thus secure the co-operation and confidence of the only power who appears capable of maintaining peace and order on the south- . eastern coasts of the Red Sea.
