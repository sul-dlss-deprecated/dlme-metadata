The practices had included producing a kind of 'hysterical insensibility' in the people they influenced, and encouraging them to pierce their own limbs with nails, which in some cases had led to serious medical consequences.The papers include correspondence between the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave), and the Political Agent, Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway); a report by the State Medical Officer, Bahrain (Richard Henry Barter Snow); and a copy of the Order of Prohibition issued by the District Magistrate, Bahrain, prohibiting the presence of the three Omanis in Bahrain for a period of two years, under the terms of the Bahrain Order-in-Council.The date range gives the covering dates of the correspondence; the last addition to the file is an entry in the notes dated 15 November 1947.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>State Medical Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Self injury</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious activities</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000014#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000014#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
