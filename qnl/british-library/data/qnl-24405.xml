The vehicle will be available for collection at 7 BCD on March 12. 3. We will arrange with P.R.O., Basra, to have this truck collected and shipped to BAHREIN. We will notify M.I.M.E. &amp; BAHREIN date of despatch. 4. QAE add that Buick No. BS 385 will not be taken over by Army Workshops. 5. We have meanwhile been informed by P.RO., Basra (reference his letter T/7074 addressed Baghdad and. not repeated to you) that the Bedford shock-absorbers recently fitted to the Buick have provided at least temporary satisfaction an&lt;? he would prefer to hold on to the Buick until he can compare it with the Hudson (on arrival). He points out that the Hudson has already required new coil springs and once that necessity has arisen it usually means that the she on absorbers have bean doing all the work and have suffered in consequence. C. P.71.0,, Basm, will furnish us with a report on the Hudson (with copy tc M.I.M.E.) 7. We learn that a handsome offer is available in the open market for a second-hand private car and should P.K.O., Basra, prefer the Hudson, he should inform us so that we can contact the potential buyer. 8. Should the Buick prove to be the better car, we shall report to you accordingly and await your instructions as regards disposal of the Hudson. ^ ASST. PUBUO KEMTONS ATTACHE Copy to:- P.R.O., Basra.

It is proposed to transfer a Hudson Saloon car from Bahrein to Basra as a replacement for Buick Saloon, BS 335, because it is unlikely that spare parts can be obtained to repair the Buick* Upon completion of the replacement of front coll springs, which are being despatched from this office to Bahrein by air on 16 Feb 45, it is understood that the Hudson will be in good condition and arrangements will b# made to have the car shipped to Basra. However, Bahrein is in need of a 15 cwt Q* truck, to replace the Hudson, for the purpose of transporting a generator and film projector and it will be appreciated if Baghdad office will apl% to Of IQ PaIFORCE for authority to draw this truck from WD stocks and dispose of the Buick, for the best possible price, in the local market. Should OHQ PAIFORCE be unable to authorise the issue of a truck it is suggested that the Buick be submitted to Army Workshops; a BLR (beyond local repair) certificate obtained; the vehicle evacuated to a Returned Vehicle rtore and application made for a 15 owt truck as replacement.

It and its equipment all arrived in good condition and it is in use now. I am sending you the Hudson saloon as soon as possible. When I came here a month ago I was sorry to see that its condition has become so bad and I am afraid you will have trouble keeping it usable. Cars here deteriorate very quickly since the roads are so bad and particularly as excessively moist salty atmostphere corrodes metal work and has a deletirious effect generally; and the Hudson has been under these conditions for 5 years; it was two years old when we bought it here. o,- C ■ Lajbrtd16.Be&amp;hfe£ 9 ns Officer, British Consulate-General, Basrah.Public Relations Office, Persian Gulf, Bahrain, Dated 8th fay, 1945. so.
