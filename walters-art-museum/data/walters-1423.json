The top of the piece is medium high, and is incised with a very detailed design. The workmanship is good and the piece is carefully made. \r\n\r\nThe piece functioned as an individualized, supportive amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet has a royal renewal connotation, and should secure life and renewal of royal authority for this king, Thutmosis IV (1397-1388 BCE); it should provide a private owner with this king's royal patronage. It is possible that such scarabs were distributed to the officials during the \"Sed\" festival of the king.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26972", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": "Thutmosis IV (1397-1388 BC)", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.47_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.47_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.47_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.47_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.47_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
