Dear Flood, With reference to the draft despatch to the Political Resident Persian Gulf, concerning oil concessions in the Persian Gulf, enclosed with your letter of 5th October, 19^2, the Admiralty have the following observations to offer v- (i) In view of the fact that the agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh of ^atar has actually been concluded, the Admiralty presume that paragraph 2 of the draft will either be deleted or drastically altered. (ii) As pointed out in Admiralty letter IT. 01686/32, paragrapfc 7, to wV] ich no objection was raised at the Meeting on 15th September, the Admiralty attach the greatest importance to the Anglo-Persian «M1 Company bringing the Persian Gulf area within their sphere of control. In view of this fact and the discussion which tooK place at the Meeting, the Admiralty feel that paragraph 3 of the ortift hardly reflects the opinion of the Meeting and therefore suggest that this paragraph should read ^On general and strategic grounds it would-.but it is always necessary, for reasons of international^olicy, that each application should be handled with great care and that no excuse should be given for an accusation against His Majesty's Government of unfair treatment.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the correspondence in connection with the agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh of Q-tar, copies of which were forwarded under your letter of .18th October, No.98116/22. 2, Under Article V of the Treaty of 3rd November 1916 between the Sheikh of Qatar and His Majesty 1 s Government the Sheikh is precluded from granting any monopolies or concessions 'to anyone whomsoever. ••••• •without the consent of the iL^h British Government'. For the reasons given below Sir Samuel Hoare is in favour of the grant of formal approval to the agreement no T A T under consideration. But he would suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in conveying to the Sheikh approval of it, should remind him of the terms of Article V of his Treaty and should make it clear that he is not in a position to grant any concessions save with the consent cf His Majesty's Gcv ernment, and shculd suggest that he wculd be well advised in future to infom the local political authorities before actually entering into any such agreement. The Auglo- Persian Oil Company might also perhaps oe informed deici-officially of the position and advised in their own interests to keep the local political auuhori ^ie s cind His Majesty's Government in close touch with any action they may wish to take Yirith a view to obtaining fresh oil concessions here or elsewhere in the Arab Principalities of tie Persian Gulf. 5. Sir S&lt;a.mel Hoare, as Sir Philip Cunliffe-Liater is aware, attaches importance to securing that any concessicn taken Ui^ier-Secre tary' of State, out/ Colonial Office, S. W. 1,5./ j^r out in this area shall not be of a merely blocking nature, but that the concessionaire shall definitely intend to develop the field, aid that the terms shall be reasonable fran the point of view of the Siieikh. He is broadly speaking cf opinicn that exception need not be taken to the present agreement on either of these grounds. The one question of importance which then arises is the extent to vihich consideration needs to be givai to the fact that the Eastern aid General. Syndjcate are known to have displayed a certain interest in the question &lt;£ securing an oil concession in Qatar. 4, The Secretary of State appreciates the delicate nature of the position in regard to the Government of the United St-ate s of America as regards oil deposits in the Gulf# In the present case, however, the exclusive right #iich has been granted to explore for oil fcr two years is expressed as a renewal and extension of a previous permit; the Eastern and General Syndicate have shown no signs off following up ttie tentative enquiries which appear to have been made by them; the agreement itself is one which may be regarded as suitable from the point of view of tie Sheikh; and the Secretary of State is of opinion, therefore, that, quite apart from the general desirability of securing exploitation of these deposits, if they exist, by a British Company such as the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, there is no obligation on His Majesty's Government to withhold approval fran the exploration licence now granted on the chance that the Eastern aid. General Syndicate might desire to compete. Dlfiiculty ought not, in his view, to be anticipated in furnishing any necessary explanaticn on these lines to the United States Government, if any representations in the matter should be received from that Government.5. On a minor but important point, the grant of any such concession, to a fcreign company direct or through the Eastern and General Syndicate, would clearly make it of great iciportance that mail arrangements at Qatar should he under British control; that some arrangement as regards jurisdiction over, and the protection, of foreigners should be negotiated between His Majesty 1 s Government and the Shaikh, and, probably, that sane local representative of His Majesty's Government should be appointed. If hoy/ever approval, as now suggested, is given to tte agreement negotiated between the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company and the Sheikh, the matter will be of less immediate importance, and Sir Scxiiiiel Hoare would agree generally with the Resident 1 s vie?/ that it would be unnecessary formally to draw His Excellency^ attention to Articles VII, VIII aifi IZ of the Treaty of 1916. 6.

Whereas, if it could be arranged that I should send Williamson alone and after the receipt of H.M.G^s approval, in order that he might gently persuade the Shaikh that the time had now arrived to commence negotiations and that there fore he had come to ask the Shaikh's views in this connection, then, I believe, we might commit the Shaikh to commencing negotiations, producing thereafter our authority to do so, or at such time as required by him.

Anglo-Persian Oil Company Hie meeting was called together to consider the situation which has arisen in connection with an application by kr. 3ampson f an official of the Iraq Petroleum Company seconded to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, for permission to visit Q^tar. to. neam stated that Sir John Cadrnan, during his recent visit to Persia, had made a careful study of the Position in the Persian Gulf, and had come to the conclusion that the -nnglo-Persian Oil Company would he well aavised to go ahead at once and negotiate an oil concession with the Uhaikh of ^tar. ihey had, therefore, decided to send out Mr. aampson to open negotiations with ^0 Shaikh, and he was at present held up at Abudan owing 10 the intervention of the Political Resident in the ^erslan Gulf. Mr. heam explained ttet the .jaglo-Perslan 011 Company were only acting as agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company in this matter. The ^ata-r areti cams within the agreement mude between the various constituent groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company and by that agreement each/each group hud undertaken not to seek concessions mcliviciufc.lly in certain areas which inciuded Qatar. The ^nglo-Persian ^ii Go in puny could no'L f therefore, take up a concession themselves. They proposed, however, in agree ment with the Iraq Petroleum Company, to obtain the concession in their own n^me, and then assign it to the Iraq Petroleum Company. He thought that if the Anglo- Persian Oil Company aid not move quickly there was danger that tojor Holmes and his associates would forestall them end obtain a concession for /unerican interests. He was anxious to avoid the same situation arising in Qatar as had arisen in Kuwait. kr. Mendel observed that His tojesty 1 s Governiient had originally thought that tne Anglo-Persian Oil Company were seeking a concession for themselves, ana he pointed out tifct the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were merely acting on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company made it desirable, in his opinion, that His iv^ajesty's Governnent should consider at once what their position was in the light of this new information. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were an all-British concern, whereas the Iraq Petroleum Company, though it *as registered in Great Britain, was an international concern, '/^hile the Foreign Office would certainly raise no objection to the Iraq Petroleum Company obtaining the concession, there had been a good deal of difficulty in the past about non -British concerns obtaining oil concessions in the Persian Gull, knd it woula be unfortunate if # after His i-iijesty's Government had agreed to kr. Sampson negotiating a concession with the sheikh with full knowled^ that the concession was to go to the Iraq Petroleum Company difficulties were subsequently to be raised over, ior instance, such questions as the so -called 'safeguards . Mr. Starling/lb' iff. fltarlIpti sai ; Uiat as far hg ttie Fetrolijutu Depart ment was concemea, ha saw no objection to Lr. iiampson bein^ allowed to proceed to Qatar and rt. got lata with the shaikh for f the concession, it would be most unfortunate if *aJor Holmes were allowed to extend the sphere of his activities to ^atar. gipmmand 0 r ^tlv^tt-C;■.TTic'.c enquired whether the Anglo- Perslan Oil Company could not Invite the Buma OU Gompany to take u F the concession. Kir. Hearn. however, aald that this would be out of the question, as It would be regarded by the Iraq Petroleum Company as a breach of faith. aoiii., H .ndfir aiY^tt-Uarnuc then stated that If it was Impossible for an all-Brltlsh Company to have the concession, he thou^t that the Admiralty would undoubtedly regard the Iraq Petroleum Company as preieraule to tfio j merloan Interests working with Itajor Holmes. fefi iiearn was asked wnether a copy of the draft concesstoT which kr. iiampson was taking with him could be supplied to His Majesty's Government. Mr. Hearn explained that certain alterations would very likely be made locally In the draft which was sent out from London. He was, however, quite agreeable to the Political Resident asking for a copy from the local General kanager of the /nglo-Perelan Oil Company. , The meeting agreed that a telegten should be sent / x Tt Immediately to the Political Hesloent, Informing him that, ^less there were other objections of which they were not ^ware. His kajesty's Government saw no reason why Jr. Sampson should not proceed to Qatar. It was explained to Jvr. Hearn that Hla Majesty's government would wish to advise upon the draft concession In ^e same way as they had offered tnelr advice to the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with the drafts for a concession In that territory. At the same time mention was made of the safe- fcUards which His Majesty's Government wished to see Inserted ^ oil concessions granted to non-Brltlsh companies over areas In/in the Persian oult. iLesa v /ere part oi u pr ^poaed ciiange of policy j -or allowing controlled oil conipunias to operftte in ^ritisn territory, whicli haa been discabuea in general terms with Sir John Caaman and other British oil interests am accepted hy them. But if applied in the case of the Iraq Petroleum Company, .ie^m was apprehensive that there would be serious diiiiculty with the foreign groups of the Ir^q Petroleum Company, in particular the French. He mentioned that no such safeguards had been required in the case of the xn-q Petroleum Compaiy'e concession in Iraq# It was, however, pointea out, to iiliri thut conaitions in li^uq were not tUe us in the Persian Gull' ana tnut the whole circuinstancao in tiiat ca^e were aiXferent. Gomuunder alvett-Garnac tentatively' expressed tl-ie opinion that the Admiralty liii&amp;ht prefer the Iraq ietroleuni Company to have the concession, even without the eaxeguards - although he had thought that the Company stiouia rind uo difficulty in accepting trieii. - rather than that the concession should ^o to purely i\merlc?;ai interests even with safeguards. It was agreed that nothing coulu he settled in regard to this matter at the pruoent tliiyj, but ti ^t the question of safeguards would have to be considered fu/ther at a suDsequerl stage, ana that as iv .r. ^arn vvat now aware of tne possihle toand for safeguards, there was no occasion to send any written coimiunication to the /Ji^lo-Persian vil Company on the subject.It.* Kxtract pciragropho fi and 7 of India Office MeTTiorandum dated the J&gt;ncl June 1933. 6. Qatar ccnceoRlon, Mr. I^eam alluded to the dis- ouflBion which had recently taken place ahout ^atar. I eaid that T had been on leave durinpr thio meeting and jirb not fully aware of the poult ion, but a brief diBcusoion took place. Mr. Hearn, who had previounlv referred to the pofiflibility of Bone arrangement between the A.^.O.G. and the Gulf Oil Company, under which the exploitation of the Kuwait conceBBion, if it went to the A.C.,should be entirely conducted by the A.^.O.C., the American intereetB having a ahare in diBtrtbution only, and had also referred to the recent acquisition of the Hasa conceBsion by the Standard Oil Cowoany, hinted at ponsible difficulties over safeguards in connection with Qjatar, particularly having regard to the international interests represented on the traq ^etroleum Company. ''he ^rench, in particular, might Bee considerable difficulty about any ri^it of pre-emption in the event of war. 7. I said that, while X did not know what had taken p^ace in the previous discuBBionB, it was only fair to say 'hat, bo far aB could be judged, the cfuestion o^ safeguama in resTject of the Qatar area waa likely t o be o^ great import ance. Having regard to the position of the Bhaikh, his treaty commitraentB and poBsible difficulties about juris diction, it would be unfair to hold out any hope that thev were likely to be easy to surmount. A different position Might arise, indeed, if the A.^.n.C. were to develop the Qatar concession, foreign companiea having a distributi. np: interest only and all personnel, etc. being Bri1 ish.

Hy* Artide 8. Sooner or later we hope to have a regular- aerodrome in Qatar and at the moment there is a rather informal landing ground. It will be necessary to provide a safeguard in respect of this. — V foO Article 3. We should agree with the Resident's views. Article/ F.C.Starling Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street,S.W.I.2. — iCle 6 - The WOrd1 ^ of this Article seems very extensive and I think it would he desirable to make some provision to safeguard the rights of the Sheikh or limit thos of the Company under it. Article The first sub-paragraph is very wide indeed in its terms. As regards the second sub-paragraph there ought, I should have thought, to be some provision to safeguard a little more than^the draft does the rights of occupiers. Article 8. In line 4, after the words 'area and' I should be disposed to insert 'subject to the same proviso'. Ar-Licle 9^ A similar proviso to that contained in Article 8 seems desirable# - Fj*' Article 10, We should, I think, quite agree with the ^ rd 0 political Resident's criticism of this Article as it stands. We might grant exemption from customs duties for not more than 10 years in the first instance (this was a point which gave rise to considerable difficulty at an earlier stage in connection with the draft concessions submitted by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in respect of Bahrein and Koweit), leaving it to the Company to raise the matter again shortly berore the expiry of that period in the light of experience./1?^ 3. experience. I do not think ther-e is any case at this stage for a longer exemption. i also agree that it is not reasonable that furniture, food stuff, and clothing required for the use of the Company's employees should he exemptea. Some provision may also he desirable in respect of harbour dues, etc. ^ f 'OZ&gt; Article II. This is, again, stated in very general terms and will prohahly require modification. ,01.3 ArtlCle 18 - We should ' I think, entirely agree with the Admiralty as to the desirability of pressing for a British Nationality Clause. We should also agree as to the desirability or considering safeguards to cover pre-emption, refining, etc. If the Company is to have the right of forming one or more subsidiary companies for the working of the concession, the agreement should specifically provide that the terms (including British control, &amp;c.) on which such subsidiary companies are to be formed, etc. shall be subject to the prior approval of His Majesty's Government and of the Sheikh. /'' Article 15. Sub-paragraph 1. It is for consideration whether the Company should not be made specifically liable to make/t&amp;H 4» make good any damage In the event of its removing its 'buildings, etc. Article 15. In the interests of the Sheikh I think there ought to he some provision that the question whether not the delay on the part of the Company is satisfactory should be subject to the approval of e.g. the Political Resident, ^7 ^ Article 16» There is something to 'be said for eliminating this elaborate provision for arbitration and leaving any matter in dispute to the arbitration of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# We will look at the agreement more closely, hut I think; it well to send these provisional notes at once.

In view oi the difficulties which have arisen, we have thought it desirable to attempt to expound nore aillv what the Adairaity had in mind when our official ^ Z (i S.ASo'.int letter 2064/33, dated 14th August, was written. 3. In the case of Bahrein, it was proposed that the following clauses which now appear in the concession should be perpetuated in the L'inin^ Lease (1) The Assignee Company is to be regis terea in Great jaritain or Canada. (2) ihe Company's office in Great Britain is to be in charge of a British subject. (3) One director of the Assignee Company is to be persona grata to H.Government. (4) ihe local representative is to be approved by H .M. Government. (5) As mahy employees of the Assignee Company as possible are to be British, or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. In addition we proposed that the lessees should enter into certain covenants based on the ^odel ining Lease; * in brief, they should erect a refinery and that the • heikh should have rights to pre-empt ' &lt;■ oil ana tascc control of the ^orks, etc., in .ar. 4. ?Uth regard to ^atar, the Admiralty, recognising that the concession must be assigned to the :raq Petroleum/ Laithwaite, Laq., India Office, S.1K.1. 1Petroleum Company, proposed that safeguards to preven i a further assignment to a non-British Company shoulu be insertea, together with the remaining Bafe^uards for British interest? on the noael of Bahrein. The idea wa^, therefore, to apply the precedent of Bahrein, modified only so far as is essential because of the assignment to the Iraq PetroleuTi Company. 5. The logical consequence, therefore, is to amend the concession now under discussion in such a manner as to permit the assignment to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but to forbid further assignment, to any company which does not co ie within all the restrictions given in paragraph 3 above. 6. Should, however, the Anglo-Persien Oil Co. dislike th- iuea of writing ftll o the safeguards into s v the concession at this stage, we should regard it as important not to press the point too hard. American interests have already secured Hasa and Bahrein and may also secure ^'oweit, and we are therefore anxious to avoid still further American penetration and ao not wish to frighten the Iraq Petroleum Company out of Q&amp;tar. 7. le should therefore suggest the following as a second line of defence:- P- /d3 fl) Article 12 of the draft concession to be amended to orovide that, in the event of assignment by the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Assignee Company should be registered in Great Britain or Canada, and that the terns of aIi y arsi Timent should be 'ubmittea ior the approval of the - heikh• (Z) When the draft Assignaent Is received, efforts to be iade to include in it as 'iany cf the safesuards -aentioned above as may oe possible, having rejard to the constitution 01 he Assignee company. 8./m 8. I trust thlfi letter will nak* our position clear. 9. I am sending a copy to Bendel of the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, ( gd). E.A. SEAL.
