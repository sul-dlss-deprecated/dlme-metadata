Oman politics. Events subsequent to the murder of Wall Sulaiman bin Suwailira* • The politios of Oman have been disturbed during the official year 1907- 1908* by another murder namely that of Sheikh Saif bin Mohsin As Siayabi porpitratod at Bidbid. fey tvro treacherous friehdo of his.This murder was undertaken to counteract in some measure^ the great political loss IT.II.the Sultan sustained by the murder of his very able and powerful A supporter Wall Suleiman bin Suwailim which was fully described last years report and also becouse Shaikh Saif bin Mohsin refused to deliver up the murderers of Wali Sulaiman bin Suwailim,the murder having occured in his the Siayibin territoiy It was proved that the Siayibin,a Ghafiri tribe,were implicated in the murder of Sheikh Sulaiman bin Suwailim. The Sultan wrote to Shaikh Seif bin Mohsin ordering him to deliver up the murderers. Shaikh Saif bin Mohsin replied that the accur sation against his followers was false and declined to comply with the request. Thereupon Shaikh Isa bin Saleh A1 Ilarithi / offorod to fight the Siabiyin,to assist His Highness and force them to surrender the murderers. The Sultan however declinedl^&lt;. offer,tpt being obviously a trecherous one,as Shaikh Isa is his• -r r Murder of Sliaildi Seif 'bin Mohsin. w hie hereditary enemy and he had every reason to suspect his complicity in the murder of Tfali Suleiman bin Suweylim. Shaikh Seif.bin Mohsin,however prepared for even tualities by building two small forts at Nafah near Bidbid, commanding the route to the Simaiyil valley. A correspondence then ensued between Shaikh Isa bin Saleh and H.Highness in regard to whether Saiyid Taimur His Highness's eldest son,should go as an envoy to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh and arrange for the surrender of the murderers of Wali . Suleiman bin Suweylim,and at the same time make a lasting peace between the two houses. His Highness the Sultan acting on the advice of the Political Agent declined these offers as there were the strong est grounds for suspecting treachery. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh would have worked on Saiyid Taimur f s religious fervour and taken advantage of his youth and inexperience to sow seeds of discord between father and son. His Highness finally replied that Shaikh. Isa bin Saleh must write in letter firm any propo sals he had to make to him. That closed the incident. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh subsequently went to Mudhaibi and Audam where he arranged a meeting with Shaikh Abdullah bin Said El Khalili of the Bani Ruwahah,another hereditary enemy of Kis Highness. His Highness the Sultan growing tired at the policy of inaction and deceit practiced by the Shaikhs Seif bin Mohsin andand Isa bin Saleh in not delivering up the murderers of Wali Suleiman bin Suweylim determind to act boldly himself and launch an astute blow against his opponents and enemies. Shaikh Seif ,i 1 bin Ivlohain at this time was at Bidbid.IIis Higimess the oultan having secretly arranged with two old friends of Shaikh Seif bii • Mohsin viz,Said bin Khamis,the Wali of Bidbid,and Muhamad bin ' Salim El Hamdi,one of his own askarees,sent them to Bidbid in order to do away with him.Shaikh Seif bin Mohsin suspecting no thing entered a Musjid at Bidbid with Said bin Khamis and on their coming out of the door together Muhammad bin Salim El Hamdi who was lying in ambush shot Shaikh Seif bin Mohsin dead. The murderers and their followers then ran off to Semayil where Said Nadir the Sultan’s second son was waiting for them.No fighting occurod as the result of Shaikh Seif bin Mohsin’s death.

The late TCali Suleiman bin Suweylim built 4 forts near Zikki,two at K aruth and two on Jebel Karun. These were garr isoned by the Bani Ruwahah for His Highness the Sultan. About 800 &lt;fner£&gt; of the Bani Riyam suddenly surprised the garrisons at jebel Karua,overpowered them and captured the two ■ ij forts. Shaikh Abdullah bin Said El Khalili of the Bani Ruwahah i wrote offering His Highness to proceed against the Bani Riyam-* Bani Ruwahah and Bani Riyam being hereditary enemies--and aske His Highness for supplies of food and money.Ills Highness accep ted the offer and sent the supplies demanded and appointed Muzzaffer bin Suleiman bin Suweylim as leader of the expedition Thereupon Shaikh Abdullah bin Said El Khalili refused co operation saying he would never servo under the son of a slave and so tho expedition ended in a fiasco. _ Saiyid Nadir from Semayil attempted negotiations with tho Bani Riyam but they .‘were also devoid of result. The Shaikhs of the Siabiyin,Rahbiyin and Nidabiyin went to sharkiyah to see Shaikh Isa bin Saleh to ask for the pro- neighbouring tribes seek Shaikh Isa bin tection of the Hinavi tribe against His Highness the Sultan Saleh’s protection against His Highness. should the latter proceed against them for not having deliver ed up- INTER-TRIBAL QUARRELS.

In April a quarrel arose between two factions of the Bani Rasib, a Ghiafer tribe of Jaalain ? 3 men were killed and 5 wounded.Shaikh Saleh bin Yasir resigned the leadership of the tribe as the quarrel arose over his suitability for the post. This temporarily caused the hotilities to cease. Two months lattr / however, a fresh quarrel arose in which six men were killed.Shaikh Saleh then committed suicide by shooting himself .Shaikh Abdullah bin Salem, the Amir of the Bani-AH', then A seized and imprisoned 15 men of the Bani Ralisib and arranged a lasting peace among the tribe. In May two factions of the Jennebeh at Sur^the Pawaris and the Arma—fought among themselves.A Bania Seth Jairam Kisowji in the arm - u was accidently wounded by a stray bullet.The Shaikhs of uannsbdi A * compensated him 'by a payment of Rs300/- with the sanction of 1 the Political Agent,who visited Sur for the purpose of invest igating the matter. H.H.the Sultan wrote to the Shaikhs of Jennebeh ordering the two sections to make peace.The Shaikhs of the Fawaris then came to Muscat to see H.H.asking him to decide thAir quarhel with th'! Arama.They accused Shaikh oaid bin Sultan the Tamimah ox xbe Jennebeh of unduly favouring the Arama. The Sultan then sent Hamid bin Hammad to Sur in his yacht the w Nur-ul-Bahr M ,with written&amp; ’ © Bani Ruwahab and Ban! Riyan* Bani Bu All and Bani Bu Hassan* Ra^il and Wadi daawal• Dliof ar* * written terms of peace which were accepted by both the sections. Owing to the old blood feuds existing between these trite fighting frquently took place between them during the year,in the neighbourhood of Zikki and the Jobol Akhdar.There was loss of life on both sides but no signal victory was obtained by HiSi 1 either party excepting the capture of the two forts on Jebel . Karun by the Bani Riyam,already referred to. Some desultory fighting took place in Jaalara between the Bani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan, powerful Ghafiri and Hinavi t-r-lrto tribes of that district. Being heredmtary enemies they are practically never at peace. Slight local disturbances occured at Nakhl and Wadi Maawal. On 10th January,news reached Muscat that the A1 Kathir of Dhofar had killed three slaves of the late Wali Suleiman bin Suweylim. These slaves formed part of the Customs guard there. The inhabitants it was remoured had sent a deputation to the Sultan of Makalla pleading for his protection. His Highness fearing a revolt of the inhabitants,similar to that-of 1897,at once despatched his eldest son,Sayiad Taimur and the Wall of Mutrah to Dhofar in his yacht,the 'Nur-ul-Bahr', along with 40 soldiers.He instructed them to take suitable steps ensure peace and conciliate the inhabitanta.On arrival at Dhofar every thing was found to be perfectly quiet.The three slaves were found to have beon killed at the in land Customs post becouse they had continued to demand on^hancsd duty so as to line their own pockets* The Kathiris however would not visit Said Taimur being afraid of being seized and deported to Muscat. Saiyid Taimur appointed a munshi of His Highness the Sultan,named Abedin Kasim Ali,an Indian Muhammadan as Customs officer. Saiyid Tainnr then left for Muscat taking with him the Naub T, r ali of Dhofaf ard a Nubian slave of the^Wali Suleiman bin Suweylim. % H.M.S. f, Pe^seus ,, paid a visit, subsequently, to Dhofar and Obituary several of the Shaikhs went on board on the invitation of the commander.He also landed and gave a few presents to the Chief Shaikhs and made a small tour in the surrounding district. On April 12th,news was received of the death at Poona,of Saiyid Abdul Aziz, bin Said,uncle of His Highness the Sultan. The Sultan’s flag and those of all the Consulates were left at half mast for a week.This unfortunate prince was named in the life time of Saiyid Turki,by the then Political Agendas the most fitted and likely heir to succeed him. But when Sultan Saiyid Turki died and the occasion arise to grasp tho power his friends and followers who twice during the lifetime of Saiyid Turki had attempted but failed to capture Muscat for him,refused to assist him.This was due to the intri- * guing of Shaikh Saleh bin Ali El IlarejJhi who to gratify his xwi own ambition&gt; own ambition did no^ wish to seo a strong man on tiie throne of Muscat. After foeblo attempts to oust his nephew from power in which he recieved no support, fnmm the in fluential Shaikhs,Saiyid Abdul Aziz retired to India where he continued to vainly ask the Govt of.India to interfere on his behalf.of import: nee vr re node a^ainct it by Urltioh cubjoots* liovertlilooo tlie porsonnol onployod oro not esuffi clontly intelligent or oducated for tho offeoient die- diarj:© of thoir duties* Ho intolligctit oyotom of accounts are kept either of money received or paid out* Cetli Da- nod or Dharooey a Jonia ic tho nOTiinal hood of the Customs.
