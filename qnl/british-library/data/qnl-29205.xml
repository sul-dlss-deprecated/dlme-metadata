High Commissioner in India, ^igh Commissioner for India, London and Political Resident, Bahrain. Sir &gt; I am directed to refer to paragraph 3 of the Government of India's telegram to the Secretary of State for India, No. 4681 dated the 13th June 1947, and to your letter No. Ext. 1893/47 dated the 16th September 1947 and to say that the views of the Government of India regarding their future representation in the Arab States in the Persian Gulf are as follows. 2. Kuwait . As His Majesty's Government h ve already been ihformed, it is the intention of the Government of India that Indian interests in Kuwait should be supervised by a Consular post to be established at Basra It has not however been possible as yet to establish Indian Consular posts in Iraq and this proposal must be held in abey ance for the present. 3. Bahrain . In view of the objections pointed out by His Majesty's Government the Government of India are a reeable that their representative in Bahrain should be desi : ni-ted Trade Agent and not Consul. They would, however, be glad of an assurance that the Indian Trade Agent will be able to supervise all Indian interests, and to exercise normal consular functions in respect of Indian nationals, in Bthriin, Dhahran, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, and thst his functions will not be confined to m? tters relating to trade. 4. Muscat . As previously stated, the Government of India propose to be represented at ' use;t by a non-career consular officer, and they are glad to note th t their right to appoint a consular representative in Muscat under the Treaty of 1939 is recognized. They propose that their* representative at Muse t should be designated either Honorary Vice-Consul or Consular Agent, and th=t he should work, under the supervision cf the Indian Trade Age t at Bahrain. 6. The Governrent of India do not propose to ask permission to establish a separate consular court at Muscat. It is, however, their understanding that so long as India remains in the Commonwealth, Indian nationals will b* able, as hitherto, to have recourse to the British Courts in the Arab States. 6. The Government cf India will be glad to be informed as soon as possible that they may preceed with the implementation! of the arr ngements proposed above for representation in Bahrain and Muscat. 7. a copy of this ietter has been sent to the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in India, to the Indian High Commissioner in Loi don and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.\ ' ' ■f No. 6t?4«S &gt; The Hon’ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, presents his compliments to The Political Agent, The Political Agent, Bahrain, muscat , (V and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the under mentioned document* Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, the 24th March 19 48* Reference to previous correspondence: Residency Printed Letter No»608-S dated 20th March 1948* Description of .Enclosure: ■&lt;&lt;« /C; ffc' C' V w Telegram No.Misc 46 dated llth March 1948 from Uni ted K.ingdom High Comm- Gulf Agency Buildings, issioner, New Delhi.f=S3| ® 7 ]i Tel«g:ram C.T.C.

Government of India have intimated informally (and will confirm in v^^lng) that they are a g re table to transfer of Kuwait premises on April iFt. 3. They wish to appoint consuls at Bahrain and Muscat and before considering proposition further would therefore be grateful for views of Political Resident in the matter of providing accommodation for them. Can existing properties be divided in order to house both British and Indian representatives suitably? If not what would Political Resident suggest? 4. Pending decision on paragraph 4 above Government of India agree that ri.M.G. may undertake upkeep of buildings and equipment from April 1st, any necessary financial adjustment to be made-later. RilL. 2sc.mam Please note for discussion at Muscat: 'Accommodation for Indian Consul'. . ltd. V.E.H. :l/3 TtAMI m CONFIDENTIAL VjO^QUSkj: b/M EXPRESS LETTER Political Agency, Muscat. 3rd April 1948. From To Political Muscat. Prodrome Bahrain (handed to Camp Muscat). Indian representation in the Qulf Tour Printed Letters Nos. 60#-S March 20th 1948 and 654-3 March 24th 1948 on the subject of Indian representation in Muscat. 0 2. I observe that the Government of India note that their right to appoint a Consular representative in Muscat under the Treaty of 1939 is recognised. I presume that they mean recognised by His Rfcjesty^ Government and not by the Sultan who has not yet been approached in this matter and in consequence has made no formal statement of his own vieY/s in the matter. 3. As regards the matter of providing accommodation for the Indian representative, I consider that it would be quite impracticable to divide the existing Agency property so as to house both the British and Indian representatives. Should the proposals for the appointment of an Honorary Vice Consul from one of the leading members of the Indian community be agreed to however, he would already have his own private house and accommodation in Muscat and it would not perhaps be necessary to find any extra accommodation. In the event of / the person eventually appointed as Vice Consul not having his own house or property in Muscat, it should be possible to transfer the lease of the old American Consulate,which is at present held by the Residency for the use of the Residents tour clerks, to the new Indian representative After painting and repairing this property it should make quite a suitable Consulate.
