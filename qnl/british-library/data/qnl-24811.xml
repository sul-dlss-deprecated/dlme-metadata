I have spoken to Kitson of the Far Eastern department, whan I believe you knew in China, and he has told me that he will be very pleased to see you at any time to suit your convenience. fterhaps you would give him a ring at the Foreign Office and arrange a meeting.

I have asked Hiss Irdell to help in Dobson* s identification and she suggests that he is Second Lieuteraml^Tai.poraiy Captain^irthur Dobson (d.C.O.) of the Intelligence Corps, and has suggested that I might get in touch with you with a view to tracking him down. Can you help me please?

Sir Orme Sargent is in charge of the Northern Department, As neither of these have anything to do with Fi-.. Eastern affairs it would, I think, be inappropriate to send Dobson to either of them. If Dobson is to be sent to somebody of Under Secretary level at the Foreign Office he should go to Sir R. I.Campbell who is f in .c harge of the Eastern and Far Eastern Departments, I have ^discussed the matter with Sir Humphrey Prideaux-Brune and he tells me that he knows Dobson quite well; they met while the latter was in China and they seemed to have both been in India together, (As you probably know Sir H,Prideaux-Brune was for a time in the China Relations Office at Delhi). Sir Hunphrey, for whose judgment I have much respect, does not consider that it would be any loss if Dobson were returned to regimental duty and is emphatically of the opinion that it would be a great waste of Sir R,Campbell* s time for him to give Dobson an interview. He suggests that he himself is ■the right person to see Dobson - he has been specially attached to the Far Eastern Department as Adviser on Chinese matters. He added that he would be pleased to renew his acquaintance with Dobson, I suggest therefore that you might write to Sir 0, Caroe telling him that we are putting Dobson in touch with Sir H, Prideaux-Brune. The necessary arrangements can then be made with the assistance of the Military Department, If I may say so this letter affords another example of Sir O.Caroe* s tendency to regard all his geese as swans - more particularly if they belong to the Study Group, You will remember in this connection that it was only recently that he suggested that we should ask Mr, Hall-Patch to give an interview to Mr.Zinkin, a particularly callow member of the I.

Tte , I a 7 , PP ^rn No# RB / U7 - iC^&gt; * 19 45. ^ Many thanks for yers of the ISth and jOth April which are very encouraging. I am rather worried oy the prospect that almost the whole responsibility for doctoring these memoranda will fall upon myself; but I will do my best and hope to be sufficiently discreet. This matter we will now pursue and I will let you know how things go. The immediate object of this letter is to tell you that Dobson, who with V.int was conducting the Secretariat side of our Group, has just been repatriated. He had not seen his wife for six years, and as a British Service Emergency Commissioned officer I was unable to obtain service agreement for him to bring her out here and therefore had to agree to his going home in the normal course of repatriation. This is a sad loss for the work we are doing and I am rather afraid that it may have to close down. Dobson is I think in the Black Latch**and will probably be sent back to regimental duty, which seems rather a waste for a man of his calibre now that the war in Europe is over. He has been three years in China, speaks Chinese well, has had a great deal of experience through the Allies Liaison Section in working with the Chinese and Americans in Delhi, has superimposed some three or four years in India on top of his experience of China, has a clever pen and considerable social graces. It seems to me it should be possible at this juncture to use him for something more fitted to his ^particular talents than regimental duty. I believe Hall- Patch, who is doing some work connected with the Ear East in the Treasury, may have been making enquiries about him and I suggest in any case that his presence in England and some account of his experience both in China and India might be brought to the notice of the Foreign Office. r Sir Cecil Kisch, KCIE., CB., India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l. 0&gt;L</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1009</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1009</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 3331/45 'Resignation of W A C H Dobson from Secretariat of the Viceroy's Study Group'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-12-20T22:11:10</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 14; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains papers regarding the potential employment of Lieutenant-Colonel W A C H Dobson by the Foreign Office or War Office upon his return to London after serving in India in the Secretariat of the Viceroy’s Study Group.
