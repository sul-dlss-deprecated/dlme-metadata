K rO WW THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED A w a 1 i, Bahrein Island. Persian Gulf. 7^7 V No.PA-4.59 27th September, 1950. His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, The Agency, ■ S~ S Manama, Bahrein ^ B Dear Sir, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited have received a letter from Mr.J.Gordon, Senior Meteorological Officer, Meteorological Office, Royal Air Force, Bahrein, requesting a report on wind speeds between 9th and 13th June, 1950, whether these were recorded and the method employed, for the information of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. A copy of Mr,Gordon f s letter is attached, a reply to which, in view of the origin of the request, I feel should be transmitted through your office in accordance with our usual practice. In reply to the enquiry the following information is submitted (a) - Are the observations made bv specially Qualified personnel ? The Bahrein Petroleum Company have no personnel specially qualified by meteorological training for weather observation. The wind recording mechanism is maintained by the Company and operated by their Engineering personnel. The data provided by the Company's records should not be regarded as being equivalent in accuracy to records afforded by observations taken at an accredited weather station. The data obtained serves the Company 1 s purposes for which readings within a reasonable degree of absolute accuracy of average wind velocities are sufficient, (b) What type of instrument is used ? A 3-cup rotary anemometer is presently installed, where it existed during June 1950, on the roof of the Office Building, a two-storey structure. Was manufactured by - Julius Freiz &amp; Sons Inc,, Belfort Meteorological Observatory, 1230F Baltimore Street, Baltimore, M,D,, U,S«A. Serial No,133-37 Chart 1015* We understand that the Bendix Corporation have since taken over the Freiz Company and that the same mechanism is now manufactured by - Bendlx Aviation Corporation, Freiz Instrument Division, Baltimore, M,D,, U.S.A,2VS PA-4.59 - 2 - 27th Septectoer, 1950. (c) - When was the instrument last calibrated ? This instrument has not been calibrated since its installation at Awali during 1938; however, checks of the accuracy of the instrument have been obtained by two methods. The first was by cross-checking with the Meteorological Officer at the Royal Air Force base during periods of windy weather last winter. The Company was informed by telephone that the instrument at Muharraq was recording the same wind velocities within a few miles per hour as were being shown at the time on the Company's instrument in Awali. The second method was by measuring the wind velocities at the same location on the Company's Main Office roof by means of a deflecting vane anemometer which is used by the Company's air-conditioning mechanics to measure air velocities in air ducts. A comparison of the average of these readings indicated accuracy within a few miles per hour. (d) - Rough details of the exoosi^ re of the instrument, i.e tt the nroylmitv of buildings, he ights of adjacent buildipggt etp, I am attaching copies of the Company's drawings BRA-5887 and BR-308. The latter shows the natural topography of the ground in Awali and the location of the Company's building on which the anemometer is mounted. The approximate location of the anemometer on the roof of the Cornpany s office building is indicated on this drawing. Drawing BRA-5887 provides a larger scale representation of all the buildings now existing in the near vicinity of the office building. The elevation of the top of each of these buildings has been marked on this print. It is believed that these two drawings will serve to provide the necessary details of the exposure of the recording instrument. In addition to the above there is attached copies of the wind velocity records obtained by the instrument for the period 9th to 13th June, 1950. I am enclosing a copy of this letter to which is attached the prints and photostatic copies of the wind velocity records, for courtesy of transmission to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, or, if you prefer, for transmittal direct to Mr.Gordon. The Photostat copies of the wind velocity records my be retained by the Ministry but the Company would appreciate the return' of Drawings BRA-5887 and BR-308 when they have served the purpose for which supplied. Yours very truly.

I have been asked by the Chief Inspector of Accidents of the Ministry of Civil Aviation to investip^te,certain statements on weather conditions which have appeared in The Bahrein Islander'. In connection with the enquiry into the accidents to 2 aircraft of Air France in June last a representative has recently called at M.C.A. Headquarters in Loudon with a copy of the 'Islander', dated 22 # 6 # 1950. In this issue there is an item headed 'Shamaals' which quotes wind speeds of 52 m # p.h. between 9th and 13th June with a peak speed of 55 m.p.h # on 11 - 12th June. The Chief Inspector of Accidents is anxious to know if these wind speeds were actually recorded and what method was employed. In order to enable me to make a full report I should be grateful if you could provide me with the following information (a) Are the observations made by specially qualified personnel ? (b) What type of instrument is used ? (c) When was the instrument last calibrated ? (d) Rough details of the exposure of the instrument, i.e., the proximity of buildings, heights of adjacent buildings, etc» I realise that in contacting you that I may have approached the wrong source but it would help greatly if you could pass this request to the proper quarter so that I can have an early reply.
