Rainfall and JELarvest.— liL most of the districts of Southern Persia the rainfall has been above the average, especially around Bushire and in Tangistan, where it was so heavy in the early part of December as to cause great loss to life and property among the inhabitants of villages situated near the base of the maritime range, owing to the sudden discharge of violent freshets from the watersheds above. Pessimistic forecasts regarding the crops were for some time received from the Karun Districts, but timely rain in March tended to improve prospects, and a welcome fall in the price of grain has resulted. At Shiraz, and in fact throughout Ears, the severest winter recorded for many years has been experienced, but owing to the copious rainfall a bumper harvest is anticipated from all crops except opium. It is satisfactory to report that owing to the prosperous condition of the standing crops in many districts the embargo on the export of grain has now been removed. The Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf Forts. —His Excellency the Darya Begi after a prolonged period of repose at the Capital returned to Bushire at the end of April on re-appointment, and has discharged the duties of Governor throughout the year. 'Public 'Peace and Tranquility.—In the month of May, notwithstandiDg that a reconciliation had just been arrived at between Zyer Khudar and Zyer Ghulam Ali, the rival Chieftains of Tangistan, a follower of the former attacked and killed Zyer Ghulam Ali, with the result that the whole district soon became much disturbed; but it was not until October that the Darya Begi acting under orders from the Central Government, left Bushire, accompanied by 100 tofangchis, to assist the Governor of Dashti in an expedition against Tangistan. Zyer Khudar fled, and after looting and setting fire to the village of Ahmed, His Excellency the Governor returned to Bushire. The Bushire-Shiraz caravan road has at no time during the year been in a satisfactory state and at intervals has been regrettably insecure. Cases of blackmail and interference with caravans have been reported and on more than one occasion toll has been levied on the mail bags of the Persian post. There wf.s considerable excitement and unrest in Bunder Abbas in the early part of *he year, and the neighbourhood of that port, as well as the Lar bADMINISTRATION REPORT ON xx.~ — n vpw disorderly state. It was even thought at district ^ ^ itself might be raided, and though this did not 0D f occur c™ traffic was practically brought to a standstill for some actually oceai J ? nfmsp of this insecurity was the dissemination from the weeks ^he apparent 'regarding the health of His Majesty the Shah, ^ lich hanri^ tu^d out to have little foundation, but which always ' sem to Ornish the turbulent section of the community with an excuse for a display of lawlessness. _ . , . . ^ ^ OmraMne and I'ublic Health. -The Qx^mntine Admm.stration of the Island of Bushire and the Gulf Ports has contmued to be admm^tercd on behalf of the Persian Government by the Bntrsh Residency Surgeons, under whose supervision European Assistant Surgeons of the Government of Jndia are miployejf as Quarantine Medical Officers at the Gulf Ports of Mohammerah, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas. ^The accommodation for upper class passengers, European and Native, ►at Lineah and Bunder Abbas leaves much to be desired, but repeated representa tions to the Central Government have not yet been fruitful of result. The Island and Port of Bushire is the Besidency Surgeon's special care as heretofore and in co-operation with him the 1 ersian Customs Administration, which is now responsible for the disbursement of the expenses of sanitary preventive measures, continued to assist in the work. In January 1905, Dr. Paivre, a French Sanitary Expert, connected with the Paris Sanitary Convention, having been deputed to make a, tour of the Gulf ports and to examine the preventive arrangements there existing, arrived in Bushire and after making a short stay visited Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, Ormuz, and Henjam. Epidemics. —During the summer of 1904 the whole region lying within the purview of the Besidency was visited by disease in a more or less severe epidemic form, the port of Bunder Abbas being the only locality which on this occasion was spared a visitation. Plague was the first to make its appearance and during May and June threatened to become epidemic on the coast and hinterland of Southern Ears. Numerous cases occurred in Lingah and the inhabitants, taking alarm, com menced to migrate inland in large numbers and thus carried the infection with them, with the result that the disease was soon reported from the Lar district. At this time there seemed good grounds to fear a widespread epidemic of plague, but curious to relate, as soon as cholera, which had meanwhile made its appearance, had gained a footing, very little more was heard of plague, and the latter pest gradually died out without assuming serious proportions. Cholera, which had already appeared at Bussorah, now spread southwards. Early in May Mohammerah and Bahrein became affected and the authorities at Bushire realised the necessity of instituting special preventive measures if Bushire was not to share the fate of its sister ports in the Gulf. The epidemic seems to have generated in Turkish Arabia or Mesopotamia and to have travelled from thence into Persia over two well-marked circular routes, one entering northwards via Kermanshah, Tehran, and Ispahan, and the other from the south, penetrating Ears through some of the small unprotected coast ports, and after spreading contagion in Tangistan generally, making its way north by the caravan road between Bushire and Shiraz. Ispahan was probably the point on the circuit where the northern current from Kum and Tehran met the southern current from the coast of Ears and Shiraz. At Shiraz, the capital of Ears, the epidemic was especially severe, though happily not of very long duration. The total mortality was assessed at from 7,000 to 10,000 souls, and when the disease was at its height, the death -roll jis believed to have touched 1,000 per diem. The fact that the inhabitants obtain their drinking water from watercourses passing through the crowded streets of the city, which are used for all and sundry purposes, probably accounts for the readiness of Shiraz to assimilate the germ'and as, owing to the yinlence of theresidency and maskat political agency for the year 1904-1905. 3 epidemic, the innumerable dead were in many cases only superficially burieJ, there is some reason to fear that the coming hot weather may see a recrudescence. On receipt of reports from His Majesty's Consul pointing to the urgent need of the Shiraz community for the ministrations of a European doctor, the services of the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, with the concurrence of the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister, were spared for duty there, and assisted by His Majesty's Consul and other European residents, he rendered such devoted service to the stricken community as the prejudices of the latter would allow them to accept. Two Europeans succumbed, one of them Mr. Van Lennep, the able and respected representative of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Captain Condon's deputation at this critical time 'was only rendered possible by the continued immunity enjoyed by Bushire itself. Though, as before stated, the disease had evidently entered Ears through some of the small ports to the north or south of Bushire, and although the neighbouring villages of Tangistan and Dashtistan were one after another infected, the port of Bushire continued to enjoy a phenomenal immunity, only one authentic case being discovered. This, 1 consider, must be attributed to two causes : firstly, the timely and effective arrangements instituted by the Residency Surgeon as Chief Sanitary Officer for Bushire and the Gulf ports, assisted by the Customs Administration, and, secondly, to the natural advantages which Bushire possesses for resisting the ingress of epidemic disease, by which I mean its peninsular formation and the character of its water-supply, both of which render the locality a comparatively easy one to handle and protect. In July the epidemic spread to the ports of the Trucial Chiefs, and for two months raged with considerable severity. It is computed that as many as 8,000 persons succumbed within their collective jurisdictions between July and September, when the disease gradually died out. Administration of Customs in the Persian 6rwy.—During the year under report the operations of the Imperial Customs Administration have been extended and developed. Several new posts have been inaugurated and the local influence of the Belgian officials of the department, wherever they are, has been much augmented by the recent introduction of an arrangement under which they are entrusted with the disbursement of the salaries of the local Persian officials. .Among the new Customs posts opened since the issue of the Eeglement Douanier those at the islands of Kharag and Henjam deserve special mention. The Arab inhabitants of the latter islands, whose place of primary origin is Debai and other parts of the Trucial Coast, have shown the greatest resentment to an innovation which they regard as a significant encroachment upon their time-honoured privileges as a semi-independent Arab community, and were it not for the revival of the British Telegraph Station on the island (outside the immediate precincts ot which the Customs official hardly dares set foot), it- would probably be impossible for him to remain at his post at all. The following interesting episode in connection with the institution of Customs posts and Guards on certain of these islands is worth recording. Monsieur Dambrain, Director-General of the Customs of the south, proceeded on tour in the Customs Steamer Muzaffer at the end of last year, and on his return to Bushire early in April 1904, it transpired that he had landed Customs Guards on the islands of Sirri, Abu Musa and I amb, and that in the case of the last two mentioned he had taken the extreme measure of hauling down the Jowasmi flags of the Sheikh of Shargah's representatives and had hoisted the Persian flag in their place. The R. I. M. S. Lawrence, which had been despatched to the islands for the purpose, having verified the reports originally received, the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran were informed of what had occurred, and the ultimate result was that the Persian flags on Tamb and Abu Musa were removed by the Persian Government themselves and the Jowasmi flags re-erecfed and an unpleasant incident was thus avoided. As regards the third island of Sirri, though the title of the Shah's Government to place their4 administration bepo rt on the persian gclf polmcal ' , been recognised by His Majesty's Government, fulheTdSsion of this point has for the present been held in abeyance. Tbe tons expected ^ came into force on Administration as conducted under working regulations of the Persian CUjjoms^ Artiole B of tlie Allg | 0 . PeS SrS'of 9th February 1903. Attached to the Bfeglement is a ikt of the pTaces at ihich Customs posts are authorised and at the head of this s it is set forth that the said list can only he departed from by special Eeso- futions of the Ministry of Customs, which must be duly nobhed to the Br.tish L(:ga I;'' ) ''n the date of the execution of the Declaration of February 1903 up to the pre«ent time, tbe Customs Administration had been guided m tbcr work by a series of temporary rules issued from time to time from the Central Office LTTJ hoea allowed considerable scope for the exercise of discretion and for iJ l the rnles on elastic lines. Now, however, that the formal ^glement hL been issued there is little further room for the exercise of any snch discre- fen and the rigorous enforcement of its multitudinous provisions ■many of .hem nTte nnsuited to Gulf conditions) has been the cause of a good deal of difficulty and friction which, however, it is hoped will gradually subside if those Articles that are found to work specially hardly can be modified m due course. So much feeling lias been caused by the strict application of certain Articles that towards the close of the year the Persian mercantile community seem inclined to show active opposition to tbeir enforcement and to contemplate, by the wav of protest, the total suspension of their trading operations until their grievances are heard. As the greater part of the business of this community is with Bombay, such a denouement could not but have a very injurious etiect upon our own commercial interests, and every effort is being made to prevent the incidence of a complete deadlock. Since the issue of the Rfeglement, serious difficulties have several times arisen with the Customs authorities at various Gulf ports in connection with mails for the British Post Offices. In their zealous endeavours to carry out the letter of the regulations punctiliously, local Customs officials have seemed inclined at times to place the most strained interpretation on some of the Articles of tbe U&amp;rlement, and in doing so have more than once been led into taking arbitrary action which, if it did not fortunately bring about any specially untoward result, produced temporary situations of considerable local delicacy, pending adjustment by higher authority. In this connection I would chiefly allude to cases of interference with mail bags in transit. For instance, at Bushire on 1st December 1904, the British parcel mail bags instead of being taken as usual direct to the British Post Office were forcibly seized by the Customs authorities and held up for a week until the matter had arrived at a settlement through His Majesty's Legation Similar attempts were also made at Lingah and Mohammerah to gain possession of the mail bags on t'leir being landed, and at Bunder Abbas four bags v ere actually seized and only released after being opened at the Custom House. Another connection in which the Customs authorities seem to have formed erroneous ideas of their powers under the B&amp;glement has been that of arms and ammunition in transit and destined for other than Persian ports. Thus in January, although a precisely parallel case had occurred earlier in the year (on which occasion the Resident and Consul-General had refused to acquiesce in the delivery to the Customs authorities by the Captain of a British Steamer of certain arms carried by passengers proceeding to Koweit) the Director- General of Customs at Bushire called upon the commander of S. S. Goalpara to deliver to him certain arms and ammunition belonging to a party of Turkish Regulars proceeding on relief from A1 Hassa rAd Bahrein and Bushire to Bussorah. In spite of several exchanges of views between the Director-General and the Residency, the former insisted on his right to seize and eonfiscate the arms, and in the end - appeal having been made to the British Consulate-General by the Turkish Vice Consul — the -Resident saw no other course open to him thanEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1904-1905. 5 to transfer the soldiers with their arms to the fast mail steamer under a guard and to send them on forthwith to their destination. This was accordingly done. These incidents are recorded as examples of the difficulties which must inevitably arise until the public and the Customs officials have become thoroughly acquainted with the precise interpretation to be placed on the multi tudinous sections of the Keglement. Meanwhile there can be no doubt of the advisability of enforcing ^ the letter of it with reserve until the many little modifications which it will inevitably need have become manifest and have been remedied. Personnel, Monsieur Dambram, who was Pirector-General at Bushire at the beginning of the year, proceeded on furlough in May and was replaced by Monsieur E. Waffelaert Irom Mohammerah. ^The latter remained until the middle of February, when he left for Kermanshah on transfer. He was succeeded on the 29th March by M. Heynssens from the Caspian Division, Settlement of Claims.—lhQ outstanding claims referred to in last year's report have, I regret to say, made no progress towards settlement, in spite of unremitting efforts on the part ot this i^esidftncy and the representations of His Majesty's Legation. Postal Service. —^The fast mail service from Bombay to the Persian Gulf has been still further accelerated during the year under report by the introduc' tion of three fine turbine steamers by the British India Steam JSavigation Company, the first of which, the Ling a, on her maiden voyage arrived at Bushire in five days from Bombay after calling at Karachi and Maskat. Major Grey was Political Agent at Maskat throughout the year. His II—Oman, report on the year's administration forms Part II of this compilation. The proceedings in the Maskat case, now before the Hague Tribunal, are now well advanced, and it is hoped will soon be brought to a conclusion. The pearling season was not at all a successful one, the take being only in. -The about half of what it was last year, while the relative prices ruled about one- Tr ueiai Coast, third less. The maritime truce has been well maintained throughout the year. Ahu Thabi. —Sheikh Zaeed bin Kalifah has spent several months of the present year at his new T settlement of Tahali in the Bereymee Oasis, in which be seems to take more than ordinary interest. He was absent from Abu Thabi both when the port was visited by Mr. J. G. Lorimer, I.C.S., on Gazetteer duty and again when the Resident visited the coast towards the close of the year. Sheikh Zaeed has recently received a fine mare with trappings as a present from the Sherif of Mecca. Dehai —TUQ administration of this Chief is the mo^t enlightened and promising of any of the Trucial Chiefs, and is justifying the enterprise of the British India Steam Navigation Company in making Debai a regular fortnightly port of call. Apart from the prosperity which this departure seems likely to bring to Bebai itself, the frequency of steamer communication with the Coast of the Tmcial Chiefs cannot fail to have a civilising influence on their subjects generally. Shargah.~- r VhQ rule of this Chief, Sheikh Suggur bin Khalid, has not been altogether satisfactory. The same lethargic temperament, which makes him unpopular with his fellow Chiefs of the Trucial Coast, gives him little or no influence over his own subjects and dependents, and when the latter are inclined to show him contumely, he evinces a tendency to sit with folded hands and let the Residency keep order for him, while at the same time he will rot bestir himself to effect settlement of the claims of British traders. The Resi dent had occasion to speak to him very plainly with regard to his line of con duct at a recent visit, and it is to be hoped' that the Sheikh's discharge of his obligations will now show some improvement. His relations with the Headman of Eujeira have not improved in any way during the past 12 months, but nothing has occurred to bring them into relief, and there'has been peace in the hinterland! Another dependent of Shargah, the Sheikh of Hamriyeh, is now a good deal estranged from 8heikh Suggur, mainly from the same causes which have alienated the Headman of Fujeira, namely, the disinclinafon of Sheikh Suggur to take steps to give his dependent adequate protection whtn occasion demands c6 ADMINISTRATION llEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL it There has heen a change of rulers at Hamr.yeh during the year under recort The late Sheikh Saif bin Abdul Eahmau died on September 3rd and was succeeded at first by his son Abdul Rahman, but the latter feeling that his po' was not very strong and believing that there was a plot brewing for his Assassination, abdicated in favour of an older kinsman, bin Sail, the la ter, returning e vil for cood, had no sooner come to power than he commenced to intrigue agjinst Abdul Rabrum and eudeavonrel to deprive him of certain items of bis landed property, until Abdul Rahman exasperated by such treatment waited for a suitable opportunity ani attacked fcaif bm Saif by ni-ht in his house, taking him prisoner and killing his son in the process'. At this stage Sheikh lia-hid, their neighbour of brnm-el-Kowein, appeared on the scene and sbttled the matter by taking Salt bin Saif away to Umm -el-Kowein, where he has since resided. Probably these incidents might all have heen avoided if tin overlord, Sheikh Suggur of bhatgah, had his dependency properly in hand. His loose rule, however, has brought its own reward, and it was hardly a matter for surprise when a report reached the Residency of the existence of a plot to depose him and to reinstate his uncle. Sheikh Salim bin Sultan, from whom in 18H3 Sheikh feuggur had^ himself usurped the Chiefship. Sheikh Suggur was fortunate, however, m getting news )f the plot in time to frustrate it. One Mohamed bin Khadim or the Ai-i-Ali ribe a kinsman of the Sheikh's and an Arab of some local influence, was jelieved to have been at the bottom of the scheme. He was arrested with ais son and detained for some time, bat eventually escaped and fipd to Umm -el-Kowein, where he has now taken uo his residence.^ Sheikh Suggur after a time and at the request of the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein somewhat magnanimously allowed IVIohamed bin Khadim to send to bhaigah for his family and moveable property. UyiiW j ' PI ' Tt —The aged Sheikh of this principality, Ahmefl bin A.bdull3j died a natural death on the 1 ath June 1^04), and was succeeded by his eldest son Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmed, aged about 35. 'I he succession was a quiet one, Sheikh Rashid having for a long time past, owing to his father s decrepitude, acted as regent. This Chief appears to be a man of some force of character and ability and is likely to acqu're influence on the Trucial Coast. In the course of the year Sheikh Rashid paid a visit to Ajman and married a daughter of the Sheikh of that place, who is already hU maternal uncle. Zorah. —During his visit to the Trucial Coast in March the Resident took the opportunity of personally visiting the little tract of ground known as Zorah or Zoara, the colonization of which has been a long vexed question among the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast. It is not marked on the Chart, but proved to be nothing but a strip of sandy plain on the sea shore between flamriyeh and Ajman; in fact it comprises the whole distance between those two places. ^ 'i he reason why there has for a long time been such a strong desire by one faction or another to colonise it becomes apparent on an inspection of the locality. The Zorah tract is in the form of half an oval, the chord of which represents the Coast line. An inlet of the sea on either side makes it only approachable by two fords even at low water, one on the Ajman side and one near Hamriyeh. At highwater it is a complete island. It follows therefore that, given the erec tion of a couple of block-houses to command the fords, the site of Zorah would form a very strong defensive position from an Arab point of view, and if the tribe which occupied it were a powerful one, they would have Ajman and Hamriyeh at their mercy. It appeared to be clearly the case that its coloniza tion could only be safely encouraged in the event of a complete unanimity of opinion and explicit agreement on the part of all the Sheikhs as to the precise conditions on which it might be occupied. Such unanimity is an extremely unlikely contigency. iv. -Bahrein. Captain E. B. Prideaux, Indian Army, took over the duties of the Bahrein Political Agency on 18th October 1904, relieving Mr. J. C.

The slackness of Sheikh Esa's rule and the consequent absence of law and order in iManama, were a cause of a good deal of anxiety to the Residency during the latter part of the year under report. This state of things was found to be mainly due to the unruly demeanour and lawless acts of the Chief's nephew and son-in-law, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, and Ids numerous negro retainers. The first incident of importance occurred in September, under the following circumstances: Some retainers of Sheikh Ali acting under his orders endeavoured to exact Sukhra' or forced labour from some coolies actually working for Herr Bahnsoa, the local representative of the German merchant Herr 'Wonckhaus trading at Bahrein and else were. Herr Bahnson hearing a disturbance going on in his compound went down to see what it was about, and in trying to save his employes from being beaten was severely assaulted by some of Sheikh Ali'S servants and even roughly bandied by Sheikh Ali himself, who lived close by and had now joined his men. Owing to his fear of his nephew, Sheikh Esa could not be persuaded to take any substantial notice of the incident as recom* mended first by Mr. Gaskin and later by Captain Prideaux, but as the Besident was soon expected at Bahrein, he asked that it might be left for the latter's decision and undertook to abide by it. Owing to absence on tour in Arabistan, the Resident's arrival at Bahrein was delaye i until 30th November, and in the meanwhile Sheikh Ali's servants had committed themselves again, on 14th November, by taking a prominent part in, if not actually organising, a wanton and savage attack on the small community of Persian (Shial^) shop keepers dealing in groceries and dry goods in the Manama Bazar. Seven or eight of these Persians were badly hurt; fingers and wrists were broken, and one old greybeard of 80 had his skull fractured. Here again in . spite of the Political Agent's efforts the Sheikh had taken no steps whateyer to punish the offenders. As the result of considerable pressure from the Eesident, Sheikh Esa accepted his advice in the case of the assault against the German subject, exacting substantial pecuniary compensation for Herr Bahnson, flogging four of the ringleaders who took part in the assault upon him, obliging his nephew Sheikh Ali to leave Bahrein for a stated period until the orders of Government should be received as to his future, and finally undertaking to notify a prohibi tion against the exercise by petty Sheikhs of the right of commandeering labour from the employes of merchants other thnn his own subjects. In the second case., the attack upon the Persians, Sheikh Esa showed the utmost obstinacy and could not be persuaded to comply with the Besident's demands 0!' to take any alternative action of a substantial nature. A reference had, therefore, to be made to the Government of India with a view to the employ ment of force, and on 19th February the Besident was instructed to proceed to Bahrein and with the support of His Majesty's ships Fox, Sphinx, and Redbreast to take the necessary steps to enforce compliance with the demands of Government, which were: — (1) The expulsion or imprisonment of six of the ringleaders in the attack on the Persians. (2) The payment to the sufferers of compensation to the extent of rupees 2,000. (8) The formation of a special guard for the maintenance of order in Manama. (4) The banishment of Sheikh Ali for a period of five years. (5) The abolition of ' Sukhra ' or forced labour as far as the employes of foreigners are concerned. These terms were presented to the Sheikh in the form of an Ultimatum, and he was given 24 hours within which to comply. During these 24 hours Sheikh Ali and his unruly followers, probably with the connivance of the Chief, managed to effect their escape during the night to the mainland of El Katr. The remaining demands were complied with by Sheikh Esa in such a way as to make any resort to force unnecessary, and a notification was8 administration eepoet on the peesian gulf political V.—Ti'! Haa=a and El Katif. VI.-Koweit and Nejd. promuleated by him offering a reward of rupees 10,000 for the capture of Sheikh Ali. This closed the incident, ard reports which have been received towards the end of the year make it appear probable that feheikh Ah will before long surrender himself. .. t, i • In view of the enhanced status of tbe British represeutetive, the Bahrein Agency has now been furnished with a Military Guard of 24 Native Infantry under a Native Officer. _ . ^ • 4 i , T) , Sheikli Esa's second son. Sheikh Mahomed,an 1 his Vazier, Abdur Bahman, proceeded on the Mecca pilgrimage during the year, and m the course o eir travels paid a short visit to Cairo from Suez, where they were the guests of His Highness the Khedive. They spoke in most grateful terms or the kindness shown to them by His Excellency Lord Cromer. The roads between Katif and El Hassa have as usual been unsafe, and several cases of plundered caravans have been reported. The Turkish Government have leased the Ojair and El Hassa Customs for 572,000 piastres and those at Katif for 470,COO piastres, to the former lessee for one year, this being an increase of 10 per cent, on last year s lease. Captain S. G. Knox, Indian Army, assumed charge of the duties of Political Agent at Koweiton the 6fch August, when the Agency was first established, and remained up to the end of the year. The past twelve months have been a somewhat critical period in the amphitheatre of Nejd politics, in which the 'Wahabi leader and the Amir of Nejd ' have continued to play the lending parts. Imhis report for 1903-1904 Colonel Kemball mentioned that Ibn Saood had considerably strengthened his position during the preceding \ear, and towards the close of it had gained a victory of some importance over Ibn Kashid's forces on the borders of the Kaseem district. This success he soon followed up, and in April 1904 placed to his credit another signal victory over an ally of Ibn Kashid s near Aneyza. ^ Continuing his forward movement he then proceeded to attack Boreida, of which he gained possession with little difficulty in the month of June, in spite of assistance rendered to Ibn Hashid by a considerable force of lurkish troops from the Baghdad Vilayet. According to the reports received at the time the victorious TV ahabi treated the conquered garrison of Boreida with no little magnanimity, which however was probably prompted by his inability to feed prisoners. ^ He allowed them all to depart in peace and rejoin Ibn Bashid, merely depriving them of their arms. A month later a further action was reported at Thibiyeh, 15 miles beyond Boreida, in which Turkish troops were again engaged and were said to have suffered heavily. Many were taken prisoners and several of their field pieces captured. Abdur Rahman bin-Saood is believed to have received yeoman help at this time from Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani of El Katr, who supplied him liberally with the sinews of war ; and in October news was received and subsequently corroborated by eye witnesses who trickled into Koweit, that, the TV ahabi had gained a still further victory, and this time had completely broken up Ibn Rash id's force, notwithstanding that the latter was reported to have been assisted by a force of 2,500 Turkish soldiers with six field guns. A quantity of tents and other loot taken from the Turks in this encounter, which shortly afterwards arrived in Koweit, afforded corroborative evidence of the truth of the above report, as did also some Turkish refugee or captive soldiers, who told harrowing tales of the sufferings and privations which they had undergone and of the ravages of disease within their ranks. Meanwhile at the end of 1904, apparently at the suggestion of the newly appointed Wali of Bussorah, who now seemed to realise that his Government had staked their money on the wrong horse, the Sublime Porte decided upon a complete change of policy, the basis of which was the abandonment of Ibn Rashid and the conciliation of the victorious Wahabi. To this end His Excellency the Wali, with the permission no doubt of his august master, proceeded to make an offer to Abdur Rahman -bin-Sacod,resicenct AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904 -1905. 9 through Ms friend Sheikh Mubarak, to meet him at an appointed rendezvous with a view to their coming to an amicable understanding and arranging an adjustment of outstanding differences. It was a sine qua non to the proposed meeting that Sheikh Mubarak should be present. This offer was accepted by Ibn Saood, probably on Sheikh Mubarak's advice, but so sudden had been the change of attitude on the part of the Turks that the two Arab Chiefs evidently looked forward to the meeting with some misgivings and consequently elaborate precautions were taken by them to preserve their own dignity and at the same time to ensure their safety. In due course, however, the meeting or meetings, for there were two, took shape at or near Sefwan between Koweit and Bussorah on the 6th and 14th February, respectively, and with apparently satisfactory results. From accounts which have since transpired as to what passed it appears that Ibn Saood intimated his submission to the will of the Sublime Porte and expressed his readiness to accept a position of general subordination to that Government and to admit small Turkish garrisons to Ileaz and Kaseem, on the distinct understanding that, except for the above leaven of practical Turkish influence, he should be left in undisturbed possession of his country and that the Porte should guarantee to keep in check his Jebel Shamniar rival and to prevent him from ever again disturbing the peace or interfering in the politics of Nejd. Sheikh Mubarak's functions at the interviews appear to have been simply those of an on-looker and referee. The latest reports received up to the close of the year were to the effect that the Mushir of Baghdad had started with a considerable force to post the Turkish garrisons at Beaz and Kaseem, and it remains to be seen what will be the result of this measure. JSTow that the strife w'hich has been so long and so obstinately maintained between the two rival aspirants to the rulership of Nejd has for a time at all events ceased to prevail, a period of rest and peace may possibly be^ in storo for the country which will enable it to achieve some measure of internal prosperity; but this desirable end cannot be looked forward to wdth any great degree of confidence and there is a palpable reverse to the shield. Koweit affairs have for a long time past been so closely bound up with those of Nejd that when the history of Nejd politics for the year has been chronicled, little of importance remains to be said regarding the affairs of Koweit itself, the daily life of which under the strong hand of Sheikh Mubarak are usually uneventful. As Sheikh Mubarak informed.the Resident recently, the regular calling of the British ] ndia Steamers at the Port materially added to the prosperity of his territory and indeed the heavy cargoes carried there from time to time by the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels demonstrate clearly enough that the trade of the Port is expanding considerably. Such statistics as Captain Knox has been able to collect form an appendix to this report. It may be mentioned in the same connection that the regular visits of fast mail steamers to Koweit liave necessitated the verification and amplification of the charts of the harbour and approaches of the Port, and that this work has been carried out during the past cold season, by the Royal Indian Marine Survey Steamer Investigator with the Sheikh's cordial co-operations and approval. Sheikh Mubarak complained a good deal during the early part of the year under report, of the .harrassing attentions paid to Phows flying his flag by the Belgian Customs officials at Persian Ports. Mis complaints were especially loud when the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, patrolled the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab in the Muzafftr and deyoted an unusual amount of attention to Koweit craft. On one occasion a party from the steamer even fired on Sheikh Mubarak's private boom the Musallm as it entered Fao creek.at 10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POETICAL src cs inasssaRS £ s&amp;RSttSfKyst tr-zcaTSrs friction between the local Turkish officials at Fao and the Land Agent Sheikh Mubarak a VII —Persian Arabistan.

L. li. Lorimer, Indian Army, was Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, and Mr. W. McDouall, Consul at Mohammerah, throughout the year. The Azem-es -Sultaneh was appointed Governor of Ar.ibistan in succession to the Salar-ed-Dowleh, whose deputy he formerly was. He arrived at bhushter early in July. . . , , The Diztu'-Eboremahad road has been extremely insecure throughout the Tear, and it was significant that in April, when the Sagwand Lurs were leaving the Dizful district for their summer quarters, they migrated by the Pusbt-i Kuli route instead of going by the direct road towards Khoremaba^. Matters seeded to improve, however, and in the autumn Lieutenant Lorimer entered into negotiations at Dizful with a friendly and influential Mir of the Sagwand Lurs and was able to obtain through him a guarantee of safe conduct bv the Kialan route to Khoremabad, where he was to meet Colonel Douglas, Military Attache at Tehran, and return with him to Dizful by the same road. All went well on the outward journey, and Lieutenant Lorimer arrived safely at Khoremabad, but not finding Colonel Douglas there went on towards Jburuiird and meeting him about eitrht miles short of that town turned back with him towards Khoremabad. On arrival there, having received apparently satis factory assurances of their safe conduct back to Dizful, the two pmcers e t Khoremabad and falling in with their Lur escort at Shah-i-Shah, camped tiat night at Chimashk and left next day for the Eort of Kila-i-Nasn. Here an attempt was made by their escort to blackmail them, and in the course of a heated argument, during which the attitude of the Lurs was ^veiy threaten]ns-, Lieutenant Lorimer saw one of them entering his tent apparently for purposes of robbery. On his running to stop Mm the Lur closed with nm and a scuffle ensued during which a shot was fired and then the two omcers were set upon and attacked. Lieutenant Lorimer received a bullet through the hand and had his jaw badly injured by a heavy stone hurled at him, and Colonel Douglas, who came to bis assistance, was shot through the right tore- arm above the wrist, both b^nes of it being fractured. \ The two wounded officers having thus been put out of action were then robbed of everything they had, and after being provided with a few tins of their own stores, and three broken-down ponies, were hustled off towards Khoremabad whither they arrived after much suffering and exposure and thence made their way to Burujird, Here they fortunately found Lieutenant Williams, I M.8., Surgeon to the Kermanshah Consulate, and Dr. Funk, of the American Mission, w r ho dressed their wounds which had now gone eight days without ^ being attended to. It was by this time the 6th November, and not till the beginning of February was Lieutenant Lorimer able to reiurn to bis post at Ahwaz, travelling v'd Baghdad. A substantial indemnity has been, demanded from the Persian Government for this outrage, together w ith the punishment of the tribe implicated. AnRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. 11 expedition started from Kermanshah in January for the latter purpose under His Highness the Parman Parma, Governor of Khurdistan, and is still in progress, but so far has achieved no practical result, as his force is apparently not sufficiently strong for the accomplishment of the purpose in view. The waterway between Ahwaz and Shushter has been from time to time most insecure owing to the inadequate arrangements made by the Persian Government for the patrolling of the river bank, and Messrs. Lynch have in consequence been repeatedly obliged to suspend the running of their steamer the Shushan above Ahwaz. On one occasion she was actually attacked by a gang of some 30 Arab robbers, and two female passengers were killed and one wounded. Had it not been for the courageous attitude adopted by the Commander of the vessel, the pirates would no doubt have got possession of her, but as it turned out they were baulked of their object and suffered severely themselves, one of their number, believed to be the Chief, beiug shot dead, For a short period previous to the arrival of the Azem-es-Sultaneh as Governor, during ^hich the policing of the river was entrusted to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the work was most satisfactorily carried out and a considerable, measure ot security was the result, but immediately the arrangements were taken out of Shiekh Khazal's hands, matters relapsed into their former insecure state, and the running of the steamer had to be suspended. Latterly the arrangements have been more effective, however, and in January she began to run again. There were severe epidemics of cholera at Ahwaz, Lizful and Shushter during the hot weather. The distase appeared in June, and it was not until October that it died out. The Hutch Engineer Monsieur Van Eoggen returned to Ahwaz in November and has been testing the rise and fall of the river and making other investigations in connection with the scheme which he is putting before His Majesty the Shah for the irrigation of Arabistan. Messrs. Lynch regard the scheme with some apprehension, as they consider it likely to impair the navigation of the Lower Karun. Authentic news was' received in February of the sudden death of the Ilkhani of the Eakhtyaris, the Sardar -i-Muffakham, at Malimir. This is the second Ilkhani who has died within a year. Authoritative information has not yet been received as to who has been elected to succeed him. Captain H. A. K. Gough, Indian Army, was appointed to this newly opened Consulate in Kurdistan. He arrived from India in May, and travelling via Shiraz and Tehran reached Kermanshah on 5th July. Lieutenant T. S. B. Williams, I.M.S., on appointment to Kermanshah as Consular Surgeon, arrived at his destination via Bahgdad on 9th July. Captain Gough remained on deputation at Urmia through the greater part of the year, on special duty, and during his absence Mr. Eabino, of the Imperial Bank and subsequently Lieutenant Williams held charge of the Consulate* The latter was deputed in January to accompany the Farman Farma and watch the operations taken by him against the Hirakwand Lurs and the close of the year found him camped at Burujird wilh the Governor. Mr. George Grahame held the post of Consul at Shiraz throughout the year. Shiraz. —The Ala-ed-Dowleh having been recalled to Tehran on 21st February 1904, Fars remained without a Governor-General until the end of June, when His Imperial Highness the Shua-es-Sultaneh arrived from the capital on re-appointment and has remained throughout the year. The early part of the year was a very unfortunate one for Shiraz. There was an epidemic of measles to begin with, and this was followed in July by the visifation of cholera dealt with in a previous paragraph of this report. Owing to the restrictions necessarily imposed in Shiraz against caravans from the Bushire side at the beginning of the cholera epidemic, the traffic was at first much dislocated, and subsequently ceased altogether as soon as the12 ADMINISTRATION JJEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL infection reached Shiraz, for its arrival was quickly followed by a genera exodus of the Persian community which was^ maintained until the end or August, when the town was declared free from disease, O ' # The persistent levy of Rahdari dues in one form or another in the province of Pars has been a constant cause of complaint during the year, and the matter has the attention of His Majesty's Legation. The opium crop in and around Shiraz suffered a good deal from the severe cold which was experienced this winter, but fortunately the damage done is likely to be more than counterbalanced by the fulness of other crops. ' Lingah.—li was found, when the divers returned from the pearl banks, that their take during the season was only f that of last year and that t e average prices fetched were about 25 per cent. less. In January 1904 two inhabitants of the Island of Sirri, who were passen gers from Shargah on the pirate coast in a Dhow belonging to Kishin, over powered the crew and shot them and their fellow -passengers dead, except one small boy, who saved himself by jumping overboard. Among the murdered men was a Khoja British subject. Information of the murder reached the Deputy Governor of Lingah through the small boy referred to who had managed to gain the shore unhurt, and the two culprits were thus traced and subsequently arrested. As they were now in Persian custody and in Persian territory, the Local Government were asked to have their punishment carried out without prejudice to the question of the ownership of Sirri Island. 'J o this the Persian govern ment agreed, and His Excellency the Darya iiegi was instructed to have the murderers taken out to sea and drowned. In the meanwhile, however, they had been allowed to escape by their guard at Lingah. One^ has now been re-arrested and put to death in the manner ordered; the other is still at large. The Customs Administration reduced the salaries of some of their employes at Lingah owing to decrease in the revenue of the Port. In this connection the cash receipts'for the six months ending 22nd September were reported to amount to about 45,000 rupees, as against 56,000 realised for the c ^responding period last year. The Vice-Consulate at Bunder Abbas has now been raised to a Consulate. Bunder Abbas.—A. P. Trevor, held charge of the post from the beginning of the year up to the month of August, when he took up the duties of Pirst Assistant Resident at Bushire. Lieutenant Shakespear, who was appointed to succeed him, did not arrive till 20th November. During this interregnum on 21st October, the British Commercial Mission about to tour in Persia arrived in Bunder Abbas and, in the absence of a British Consular representative, had to put up with much obstruction from the Local Customs representative, which was only withdrawn after considerable telegraphic correspondence. At every important place visited except Bunder Abbas they were treated with much courtesy and attention. The Belgian official, who was responsible for .what occurred, has since been transferred. Major P. M. Sykes, C.M.G., continued to hold the office of His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman, until a few days before the close of the year when he proceeded to officiate as Consul-General at Meshed during the absence of Colonel Minchin. In May 190i Monsieur Miller arrived as Consul for the Russian Government. His Highness Zaher-es-Sultan was again appointed Governor. The most important event which occurred within the scope of the Kerman Consulate was the advtnt of the Commercial Mission to Kerman and Eastern Persia under the Presidency of Mr. Arthur Gleadow-Newcorien representing primarily the Upper India Chamber of Commerce, with whom were associated Mr. B. E. Luffman as Assistant Delegate and Mr. P. P. Ryan as Secretary. It is to be regretted that the two Parsi Delegates, who were at first nominated by the Bombay Chamber of Commeice, were subsequently withdrawn^ and theirRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1904-1905. 13 non-arrival at Kerman was no small disappointment to the Parsi community of that centre, for the amelioration of whose circumstances His Britannic Majesty's Consul has earnestly laboured during his residence in Kerman. It was at first intended that after dealing with Kerman the Mission should travel to Bampur and thence via Magasand Kuhakto Gwadur, but on turther consideration it was decided that after visiting Khabis, Bam and Jiruft the party should return to Kerman and proceed thence to Yezd, Shiraz and Bushire. At the end of the year under report the members of the Mission accom panied by Mr. Grahame, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Shiraz, were on the road between Yezd and the Capital of Fars, and hitherto had bad a successful tour. Kerman suffered from epidemics of small-pox and cholera during the year. The former raged for some weeks in September, and in October was followed by an outbreak of cholera, but happily the visitation was a mild one and soon died out. The frontier meeting which took place at the beginning of the year for the settlement of frontier claims, met with a considerable measure of success and there is good reason to hope that the meeting now in progress for the current year will be still more productive. Forty-six slaves were freed during the year. xi.-^Jave There has of late been a regrettable increase in the export of Mel&lt;rani Trade slaves to the opposite shore of the Gulf, both to the coast of Oman and that of the Trucial Chiefs. Every effort is made to trace and rescue them when heard of, but it is exceedingly difficult to place any effective check on their import as long as adequate measures are not taken on the Persian side to stop their export. B-epresentations made by His Majesty's Minister to the Central Government have not as yet had any appreciable effect. In March the Resident visited the small community of freed negroes .voluntarily domiciled at Bassidu, and found them quite contented with their lot. Not one of them was willing to leave the station. They have built themselves huts within our limits and many of them cultivate a small plot of ground, and if their means are small and their life frugal, they are at all events free from any sort of worry and oppression. No trace has been discovered of the Arabs who perpetrated the piracy on xil —Piracies- the Karachi sailing vessel mentioned in last year's report, and the efforts of His Britannic Majesty's Consuls at Mohammerah and Bussorah in this direction have been barren of result. In August the pirate Ahmed bin Selman seized a boat with its crew at Sefwa near Katif, and'proceeded to sea. He first took B2,380 from a boat belonging to Saeed bin Mahomed El Mehanadi of Khor Shagig in Katr, off Bas Bakan, He next plundered a Persian boat laden with melons. A British man-of-war was on duty at Bussorah during the date season as usual and nothing untoward occurred during that time, but later several instances of piracy occurred. Thus in December some pirates boarded a boom off Katif, killed three of the crew and carried off $200, The following morning the authorities at Katif sent soldiers in search of the marauders. They brought iu three men from Tarooth and two men from Anaaz, all of whom were imprisoned. As a sequel to this outrage, a Persian boat from Tangistan crossed over to Katif to wreak vengeance on the pirates who had murdered their countrymen. They attacked a Darein boat on the high seas, killed eight men and then left for their country. Four minor cases of piracy occurred in or near the Shatt-el-Arab—two on Bahrein and two on Koweit boats. There seems to be little falling-off in this traffic. When one market slackens another takes its place. As long as treaty stipulations preclude altogether the restriction of the import trade into Maskat, and export therefrom, so long will lucrative markets be found for the arms. From the reports of the Political Agent, Maskat, and from ind&lt; pendent information received frcm the Persian side there is reason to fear that the illicit E11 administkation BEPORT ON the P ERSIAN gplf polit ical XIV-Resi- deut's Tour. 7' . „ TTT nnr « vflT1 s DlTinj? between Mekran ports and the traffic carried on V 4 f f h d f for som e time subsided, is again being vigorously Afghan frontier, which Had xor pushed. «nf fhe clearing of native craft for Mekran Any authentic ^ • tec i forthwith to the Belgian Customs, who have with arms has been C thgCoask aild a f ew arms have indeed been captured'by t™btitCly a very small portiou of the quantity that must have entered the co autry. nl ,fhreak of cholera at Shiraz and the imminent Owing to tho*e* f or gome months existed at Bushire, the Resident prospect of ®n epidemic wmcnior so sumln er as usual.

During the year under review very few serious intertribal quarrels have p n ^.5- nal taken place in Oman and the general peace has been a welcome source of satis- 0 11CS ' faction to the Ruler, who is accustomed to find the resources at his command insufficieDt to maintain order much less tranquility throughout his dominions. Of such disturbances as have taken place the following are the most serious (1) Enmity between the Ghafiri and Hinavi tribes inhabiting Nakhl and Wadi Ma'aval produced various small conflicts during the earlier part of the year. In June, however, Sheikh Rashid bin Azaiz, who has frequently been mentioned in these reports as one of the Sultan's most trusted Lieutenants, succeeded in effecting between them a peace which practically lasted until the end of the year. (2) Towards the end of September a troop of the A1 Wahibeh, a lawless and warlike tribe of Bedouins of the Hinavi section, while on a plundering excursion in the neighbourhood of Ghor, a town on the borders of Jaalan and the Sharkiya, encountered a party of the Beni Bu Ali tribe and a somewhat sanguinary conflict Resulted. Erom among the opposing sides 26 men were killed and wounded, the former including a son of the Beni Bu Ali Chief, Abdullah bin Salim. It was feared that in revenge for his son's death Abdullah bin Salim might be led to wage war on a more lavish scale than usual, but he appears to have contented himself with (as was generally supposed) contriving for the assassination of a Sheikh of the A1 'Wahibeh tribe in the neigh bourhood of Maskat some months later. (3) On November 29th a serious encounter took place at Semmed between two sections of the Habus tribe in which a dozen men were killed or wounded. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh Al Harthi, who happened to be in Semmed at the time, intervened and arranged a truce between them, which subsequently developed into a lasting peace. A further mention of Sheikh Isa is necessary when dealing with the inter nal politics of Oman. The father of this Chief was a most malignent enemy of His Highness the Sultan, and, as is well known, headed the famous insurrec tion of 1895 against his rule. Rightly or wrongly Sayyid Eai^al credits the sons with having inherited their father's enmity towards him and is in constant dread of another organised revolt headed by the eldest, Sheikh Isa. It is somewhat remarkable that all the latter's principal actions during the past year have been, like that referred to above, ii the interests of law and order. His Highness is of opinion that Isa is only waiting for sufficient power and a favourable opportunity to make himself' objectionable, 'Whether this is so or not remains to be seen. 2. The dominions of His Highness the Sultan were visited during ^ ie SatoSes ^ summer by an extremely severe epidemic of cholera which spread from town w iJ to town and district to district with extraordinary rapidity. Erom a large number of places it was found impossible to obtain statistics, but there seems no doubt that over fourteen thousand persons perished in the Wadis of Ru^tak, Semail and Ma'aval, the Batineh Coast ports and the environs of Maskat alone. In Maskat only 43 and in Matlrah but 12 oases occurred, the escape of these towns is largely attributable to the energy and promptness with which the Agency Surgeon instituted quarantine stations, the willing assistance rendered to him by His Highness the Sultan and his officials, and the calm and sensible manner in which the majority of the people submitted tb the annoyance of detention when it was necessary. It is worthy of mention that no disturbance * »ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GTJLF POLITICAL Customs' Arms traffic. Bain. Government Buildings. SlaTe Trade. 18 worthy of the name occurred in any of the quarantine stations throughout the ^ K ks occurred, as usual, now and then during the hot weather in Maskat and Mattrah, in the most severe of which on 30th May at Mattrah some 400 houses were burnt, three lives were lost, and property to the value of twenty thousand dollars was destroyed. x , On 25th October a gunpowder explosion took place at Mattrah m which five men were killed and 13 injured. _ 3 General —The Customs administration has been carried on during the vear without any change in the methods adopted when His Highness took the management into his own hands. No complaint of any importance has been received from British subjects in this connectioo, and tne treatment of merchants generally is satisfactory, but from a financial point of view there is still much to be desired in the conduct oj' affairs. The Customs office is frequently in debt to merchants owing to sudden demands being made upon it by His Highness which have to be met by requesting merchants who are expecting consignments, to pay something in advance. This state of things is not likely to improye, particularly as a decrease in the demand for arms and ammunition has already made its appearance. The Customs revenue at Soor shews no increase. The reasons for the unsatisfactory position at this town have frequently been touched upon m previous reports; it is hoped that the settlement of the Irench Hag difficulty, which happily is shortly to be expected, wi 1 ! to a large extent remove the deadlock which it is estimated causes a loss of revenue to the Local Government of no less than sixty thousand dollars per annum. The Customs arrangements at Gwadur have been fairly satisfactory throughout the year. 4. It will be remarked that there has been an enormous increase in this branch of trade during the year and large profits have been m:ide chiefly by certain foreign firms. It is supposed that the large majority of arms sold during the past year were exported to Koweit, small quantities having probably been smuggled into Persia and the Mekran Coast. -Che demand now shows signs of decreasing and the figures for next year will probably be very lovf. 5. Good rain has fallen in Oman during the past cold weather, and it is hoped that the drought of the last few years has come to an end. 6. The new quarters to the Agency Surgeon, and Telegraph and Consular clerks have been completed and the small house situated between the latter and the Customs premises has been acquired by Government during the past year. The sea wall in front of the Consulate has been extended to the Customs wharf, whereby adequate protection against heavy seas has been given to the whole premises, ami a certain amount of land has been reclaimed. The premises of Mr. J. S. de Mello consisting of his own house, and the lines of the Sepoy Guaru attached to the Political Agencj have also been purchased. Owing to His Majesty's ships having been employed throughout the year on other duties no capture of slave dhows was effected. It is believed that the trade formerly carried on between Oman and the neighbourhood of Zanzibar has received a check, no doubt owing in a great measure to the salutary lessons which have recently been administered to persons participating therein. With regard to the large capture of slave traders made by the Portuguese cruiser Safi Ucifacl in March 1902, news was received by the Political Agent •in July last for communication to His Highness the Sultan, to the effect that the culprits had been sentenced by the Protuguese Courts to 25 years imprison ment. 1 His Highness received this information with composure, and asked that his thanks might be expressed to Government for the trouble they had taken, in making enquiries, ; No less than 105 slaves took refuge at the Political Agency during the year. Of these six were found not to be entitlecl to freedom, four left the Agency permises while their cases were still under discussion, and theRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. remaining 95 were giving manumission papers in the usual manner. Of this number 35 were Airicans, for whose disposal the usual arrangements were made, and 60 were either Persians or Baluchis who had been exported from Jask and certain Mekran ports to Sohar and other places on the Batineh Coast. In connection with this latter traffic strong measures have been and are being taken by His Highness the Sultan to deal effectively with such of his subjects as have been concerned in it. The chief offender on this side appears to have been one Jemadar Abdullah, the Commander of His Highness's garrison at Sohar, who was in league with certain Persians at and near Jask. This Jemadar has recently undergone a period of imprisonment in Maskat on this account, and has now, it is said, fled to Baluchistan; while representations regarding the share taken by their subjects in the traffic have been addressed to the Persian Government. It is to be hoped that these representations will be renewed until they meet with some result as it is dfficult to deal successfully with a matter of this kind unless both parties co-operate heartily. 8. The great social event of the year in Maskat was the marriage of Sayyid Marriage of Taimoor, the Sultan's eldest son, to a daughter of Sayyid Ali-bin-Salim-bin- Taimoor. Thowayni, His Highness's cousin. This took place in December and was accompanied with general feasting and rejoicing among all classes and com munities. His Highness the Sultan entertained each community in Maskat and Mattrah separately as well as a number of visitors from outlying stations, and invited the European representatives and their families to dinner in honour of the occasion. The Political Agent paid a special complimentary visit to the bridegroom during which he presented the congratulations of Government and a Silver Coffee and Tea Service as a token of their regard. 9. The event of the year which gave most trouble and anxiety both to Marine. His Highness the Sultan and to the Political Agent was the massacre of a boat's crew of the S. S. Baron Inverdale on Maseerah Island in August last. This unfortunate vessel, the property of Messrs. Hogarth of Glasgow, was on her way from Karachi to Aden and grounded on Kabbya Island, one of Kuria-Muria group, on the 2nd August. Three days later, the master, officers, and crew (with the exception of eight men who preferred to remain on board) with one boy passenger, embarked in two of the ship's boats, intending, it is believed, to cross over to Dhofar, and travel thence by land to Maskat or some other place of security. The total number of persons who left the ship appears to have been 23, of whom 17 embarked in the larger boat, and six in the smaller. These boats were not successful in reaching Dhofar, but were carried out to sea. The smaller of the two has never been heard of since, and was probably lost in the heavy monsoon sea which must have prevailed to compel the boats to alter their course. The larger boat journeyed on northwards, either under compulsion by the sea or with the hope of eventually reaching Maskat, and about the 15th August arrived off the Island of Maseerah. It is not known exactly what took place there, but in all probability the natives saw the boat coming and wished to plunder its contents, the occupants naturally objected, and a dispute ensued which culminated in the massacre of the beat's crew, and the confiscation by the Arabs of whatever money and supplies they found with them. It is certain that no person remained alive of the unfortu nate refugees. The first news of this tragic occurrence to reach Maskat was contained in a letter to His Highness the Sultan from Sheikh Isa-bin-Saleh (referred to in the commencement of this report), who stated that a rumour bad reached him to the effect that 17 ' Englishmen' had been massacred on Maseerah Island. This following upon a report which had reached to the Political Agent two or three days before (23rd August) regarding the wreck of the Baron luverdale raised suspicions that the two events might be connected, and the Gcvvernment- of India were communicated with the result of which was that H. M. S, Lapwing w as despatched from Karachi to the scene of the supposed crime, , and H. M. S. Merlin was placed at the disposal of the Political Agent for a visit to Maseerah- Island in company with His Highness the Sultan. Neither expedition was productive of result, the matter was successfully concealed and both parties returned to Maskat, H. M. S. Lapwing on the 8th and H. M. S. Merlin on the 18th September without having gained20 ADMIMTEATIOS REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL any farther information. Letters, however, continued to arrive fromthe interior frivinf? details of the crime, and eventual y His Highness the Sultan set off aaain in his steamer Naur-elM on the 26th September to^ make furthw^investigations. After an absence of 12 day» he retnrned having discoverd the matter, and bringing with him thirty prisoners, and a tow relics of the murdered party. It appeared that during a house to house search in the village of Ras Half at the north end of the Island, the place mentioned m most of the letters as having been the scene of the murdbrs, part ot a manner s iacket was found riddled with bullet holes and stained with blood. The search party on finding this commenced making arrests on the spot and one discovery led to another. Eventually the party returned with 9 of the actual murderersi and 21 of the chief residents of the Island including the Sheikh. From the prisoners' statements it appeared that the actual murderers were 19 in number, 14 of which belonged to Ghafiri tribes and 5 to Hinavu Of these 9 had escaped to the mainland, 1 was in hiding on the Island and could not be found, and 9 were in custody. The principal residents oi the Island were imprisoned by His Highness for having hushed up the Blatter on the occasion of bis first visit. On the return of the Nour-el-Bahr to Maskat the Government of India were communicated with at the buitan 8 request^ and. the following proposals received sanction ;— (1) That the murderers should be conveyed to the scene of the massacre for execution. (2) That the village of Ras Half should be burnt and all arms found in it should be confiscated. (3) That the principal residents referred to above should be imprisoned for a time. (4) That the Sheikh should be deported. (5) That the remaining murderers should be executed on arrest. (6) That His Highness should be asked to station a guard on Maseerah Island. The majority of these proposals have been carried out, but hitherto Hia Highness has found it impossible to arrest the culprits who are still at large. It is considered, however, that a salutary lesson has been conveyed to the Arabs, and that they will deal differently with shipwrecked Europeans in future. 10. The Political Agent left Maskat on 1st March with the hope of tour ing as far as 2ikki aud Manah, but had only arrived at Pinza, some 40 miles from Maskat, when he was overtaken by important papers which necessitated his return.

General remarhs. —A comparison of the statements of the import and export trade of Bushire for the years 1903 and 1904 con?piled from Customs House Tariff and returns demonstrates that the gross imports show an increase of £19,022 and the exports of £88,315. Imports. —The increase in imports is due to an increase of £67,896 over 1903 in gold, silver, and nickel monies which, if deducted, would cause the import trade to show a decrease of £48,873. This would be consistent with the general aspect of the trade of Bushire for the year under revision. The decrease is mainly due to two causes, firstly, an epidemic of cholera which practically brought trade to a stand-still for some three to four months of the year, and, secondly, to the generally dull state of the markets in the ioterior. Tea. —The returns show a decrease in this article of some £3,000, but this is mainly due, I am led to understand, to the high duty levied under the new Customs Tariff on more expensive teas and, therefore, cheaper qualities are imported. There is also good reason to believe thai? the high duty on this article has been a great incentive to the smuggling of the commodity through the numerous small ports along the neighbouring coast. Exports. —Exports, excluding specie, .show an increase of £74,801, the amount being principally made up by the following :—Drugs and medicines, almonds and pistachios, gum, opium, skins undressed and raw cotton, which were exported to India and Persian Gulf Ports, England, India and Germany^ England and China, India and Erance, England, India and Russia, respectively. Wheat. —Owing to the imposition of an embargo and a somewhat scanty crop practically none of this was exported during the year. Vegetable substances. —The decrease in vegetable substances is mainly due to the fact that rose-water was in 1903 calculated under the heading of vegetable substances and in 1904 under that of drugs and medicine. Exchange. —London exchange fluctuated from Krans 56 to 62J per £ sterling, and Bombay exchange from Krans 376^ to 4l7i per R^00. This was due chiefly to the cessation of all export from the north of Persia to Russia and the consequent difficulty of purchasing exchange as cover for sales. Freights. —For the first nine months freights to the United Kingdom were steady at shillings 27-6 and for the last three months at shillings SO per ton. Outward freights were about shillings 35 and those to and from India R10. Transport. —Normal transport rates averaged throughout the year from Krans 85 to 90 per hundred maunds, but during the three months of the cholera epidemic transport at any price was unobtainable. The Customs. —Although the Customs regulations in many details are quite unsuited to the peculiar local conditions holding in Bushire and other Gulf ports, they are, as applied gradually, becoming better understood by the mer cantile community. The fact remains, however, that the enforcement of the multitudinous pro visions of the Reglement taken in conjunction with the working of the existing landing and porterage system under which the Hamal Bashi or transport agent, though theoretically the servant of the consignees, is practically the nominee and employe of the Customs House, continues and will continue to generate a good deal of friction both between the steamship companies and the consignees, and between these two bodies and the Customs Administration. Moreover, the expenses, liabilities and losses from damage, etc., have according to the statements of the mercantile community increased from 20 to 30 per cent, since the introduction of the new Tariff and the R^glement Pouanier, all of which causes tend to retard the progress of the trade of the22 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT OK T HE PERSIAN GPU POLITIC AL ^ (67 per cent.) comes from the United Kingdom and w; Traders -It is found that the new Customs Tariff (with its numer- bmall J . raaf y n+,.

LT'hoir good' and to S it would be adviBable for them to, study the Ki;glement Douanier. The principal pomta to be oorne m mind are as follows :~- (1) Invoices must be carefully and correctly made out showing the exact net and gross weight of article despatched, place of origin, cost, and description. (2) Such invoices should be despatched in time to reach their agent or consignee before the arrival of the goods in Bushire so as to * enable the consignee to make out correctly the very precise declaration form, etc., required from him by the Customs House. The adoption of this procedure will save much extra time, trouble, and expense. Advice to Steampship Companies. —Steamship companies would also do well to study the Reglement Douanier, and where possible endeavour to adapt themselves a little more than they seem to do at present to ihe peculiarities o the port, its harbour, Customs regulations and landing conveniences. It is important too that they should show increased consideration for the cargo of the consignee. As it is, there seems to be a tendency on the part of steamship companies to embellish their already amply safe -guarded Bills of Lading by the addition of diverse rubber stamp adornments embodying ex^ra charges or extra conditions calculated to free them from every conceivable form qf respon sibility in respect of cargo handled. Consignees are thereby placed in a very helpless position, and there is much doubt whether such an over-cautious policy is not likely to prove^ as prejudicial in the long run to the interests of the carrying agents as it certainly is to those of importers. Shipping—One hundred and fifty-eight (168) steamers with a tonnage of 180,667 have entered and 100 steamers with a tonnage of 106,178 cleared the port of Bushire, showing a decrease of 1 steamer and 14,625 tons in tonnage under entrance and 11 steamers and 10,187 tons in tonnage under clearance. IW (4) with a tonnage of 6,012 tons were under the Russian flag. R. A.

The total -value of trade for the year according to the figures furnished by the Superintendent of the Sultan's Customs is returned at $6,098,849 as against $6,390,420 of the preceding year, shewing a decrease of $291,571, which is due to the great falling of in the articles of export especially in dates ; though there is an increase of $163,969 over the last year's figures on the import side. The total value of imports amounts to $4,044,549 and that of the exports to $2,054,300, thus shewing the import trade is nearly double the export, and consequently it would appear that the balance of trade is against the country to that extent. However this is not the case, as arms and ammunition imported from Europe, and piece-goods from the United States are again exported. Moreover the exports probably exceed the estimate returned by the Customs Superintendent, who keeps no record of the merchandise leaving the country, as it is not compulsory on the exporters to take out manifests from the Customs Office as is usually done in other countries for statistical purposes. The export figures as given by the Customs Office are therefore only approximate. The last year's return showed an increase of $675,145 on the import side, and this year's again gives an increase of $163,969. The chief items which contribute for increase are arms and ammunition, piece-goods, coffee and rice. There is a falling off in the imports of sugar, silks, silk goods, cereals, and specie. In the preceding two years the exports showed slight decreases, but the year under review shows a decrease of $455,540 over the last year's figures. This is due to the great falling of in dates which form the principal item of this country's produce for export: there was no break in the drought men tioned in the last year's report, and consequently the date produce was scanty and the lowest of the last 15 years. Almost all articles of export show at decrease with the exception of pearls and salt.

The year 1901 has been one of the worst, from a trade point of view- General Eemarks. which Bunder Abbas has yet experienced! ., , ,, , itain was good, crops were excellent and the condition of the country was such as should have natarally given consider- able impetns to trade; but the figures, compiled from the careful statistics of the Custom Department, show a very different state of affairs The valno nf the imports is the lowest yet recorded in ye^rs, for which reliable statistics are available, being £317,708 against £419,145 for 1903 or a fall of 29i per cent.; and, against ±,3-9,29/, the previous quinquennial average the fall is Si per cent. The value of the exports, notwithstanding the removal of duties on almost all goods exportedj has also fallen, being £122,165 against £138.632 or a fall of near y 12 per cent, and, against £139,097 the previous quinquennial average, the drop is also about 12 per cent. The figures for 1899, however are unreliable having been obtained more or less by guess work and are mani festly too low in the case of imports and too high for exports; the quinquen nial averages are therefore not quite true indices of the trade. The United Kingdom and Tndia supply 31*2 and 47 4), respectively or 78*6 per cent, of the total imporis and receive 6'1 and 761, respectively, or'81-2 ver pent, of the total exports. The next best countries are France with 6*8 per cent, of imports and Arabia with per cent, of the exports. The depression noticed in last year's report continued, trade being almost at a standstill until October ; it is only during the last three months of the year that any real volume has passed through the port. In view of the general prosperity of the country it is difficult to explain Customs tariff and duties. o^use of the great decrease, especially # # in imports. Local opinion does not hold that it is due so much to the rise in the Customs duties brought about bv the tar 1 ® of February 1903, as to the many harassing formalities required by the Customs authorities and to the rigorous manner in which these formalities are enforced. There are a number of stamp fees and petty dues on all goods which are incurred between delivery from the steamer and clearance from the Customs House, which must be paid before removal. These dues do not amount to a large sum on a large consignment of one article, but the propor tion paid on large and small miscellaneous consignments varies enormously and so much to the detriment of the latter that the sale of small consignments at a profit becomes a matter of some difficulty. Added to this is the fact that the very complicated rules, apparently framed on European models, are not yet properly understood by the native community. There is no doubt that many small traders have found it exceedingly difficult to continue business, some having even given up the struggle and gone elsewhere. I would repeat the warning to merchants, contained in last year's report to closely study the tariff and subsequent regulations which must be complied with, however complicated and unnecessary they may seem to traders; com pliance with the provisions will be found to save endless trouble in the clear ance of goods by consignees. The coverings of packages should be reduced to a minimum, for most of the duties are levied on gross weight; gross weights of packages should be shown in invoices as well as the values of goods; invoices and Bills of Lading should be despatched by mail as soon as possible, so as to reach consignees before the expiry of 14 days from the landing of the goods, as warehouse dues become leviable after this period ; it frequently happens that the consignee has either to let his goods remain in the Customs and incur ware house dues or have them all opened out in order to make a proper and completQ declaration for ciearance.112 administeation report on the peesian gtjle political Aniline dves and articles containing aniline are prohibited import or export. This prohibition, however, was Embargo. no t enforced until January of this year [19051. which had the effect of causing a large export of carpets, efforts being made to clear stocks before the prohibition should take effect. The embargo against the export of cereals, which was imposed some years ago still continues in force. The Commercial Mission from India has been touring over South-East and « . * 15 Central Persia from October 1904 to Opemog. tor British trade. ig05 ^ Mission . g report published should be studied thoroughly, for the markets which this port supplies are those of Soutb-East and Central Persia, and it is to these markets that merchants should look for openings. Red oxide of iron and salt are obtainable from Hormuz Island; a large quantity of raw cotton, wool, assafcetida, almonds, pistachio nuts and raisins are exported. The raw cotton and wool furnish openings which might be better utilized by merchants trading direct with the United Ivingdom, The whole of th6 export in these articles is at present to Indian ports whence, I believe, they are re-shipped to the United Kingdom. The rise during the year is due paitly to a better market in India, partly to the heavier import duties in Eussia, and perhaps also to the general dis location of trade owing to the Kusso-Japan War ; much of this trade has conse quently been diverted southwards, and could, I think, be further improved. In spite of the general depression in the import trade, Russian and . . , , German goods have advanced steadily. Progress oi nva. tra e. whilst American goods and Mauritius sugar appear in the returns for the first time. Imports from the Arab Coast have also improved. Apart from the general depression, French, Austrian and Chinese imports have declined considerably. The figures for tea are remarkable ; the import from India, China and Java has declined by 61, 80, 62 per cent, in each case. A very little Ceylon tea has been imported for the first time, but it is difficult to entirely explain the above figures. Large stocks were held by merchants before the heavy rise in duty, but large as these were, they could hardly represent over 65 per cent, of the previous year's import. The local explanation is that the tea, Indian as well as other kinds, now finds entrance to Persia by some other route, either from Quetta through Seistan or from the north by the Russian railways. It is satisfactory to note that the position of Indian and Ceylon teas is now better than that of Java tea, larger quantities having been lately imported. In loaf sugar France has suffered from German, Russian and Egyptian competition ; and British, Russian and Mauritius soft sugars have displaced a considerable amount of the Austrian article. Though much kerosine oil is now brought in Russian bottoms, the trade, from Bombay by native boats, has in no way suffered. In exports the most notable increases are to Arabia and Switzerland entirely carpets, and the Arab Coast, miscellaneous goods. The decrease has been in carpets to Turkey and Turkish Arabia. One of the greatest difficulties at this port is the want of a bank. Some Difficulties in way o£ trade. years ago the subject was opened by the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, but was allowed to drop. A bank would, I think, after a short time do excellent business , it is desired by all merchants and the facilities for drafts loans and other banking business would certainly give trade an impetus. At present all loan business is carried on by Hindus at a very high rate of interest. Again drafts on India are also entirely in their hands.h ptfl teas is in RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-190^ Arrangements for landing and storing cargo are still unsatisfactorv though thefts from lighters have ceased, and the wareliousing of goods has be™ slightly improved.

The rates during the hot months, June to September, were slightly higher than the above. The transport is by camel or donkey, a fact which merchants will find worth remembering when packing goods to be forwarded to the interior with out breaking bulk at this port. The rate of exchange at present is 4 krans to the rupee. Owing to thd ^ Exchange. absence of a bank there is no demand for sovereigns and consequently no separate rate of exchange for gold can be quoted.

An epidemic of cholera raged throughout the Islands between May and September, from which over 6,000 deaths are estimated to have resulted. A large number of the inhabitants fled to other parts of the Gulf at the commencement of the outbreak and precautionary measures, varying in degree of severity, were adopted in the Arab and Persian ports against imports from Bahrein, During the first four months of the year an embargo imposed by the Persian Customs authorities against the exportation of cattle was also felt severely here, as dates are the only staple of food which has not to be imported. On the other hand, the take of pearls has been good, and the date crop was very satisfactory. Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., of London and Bushire, have opened a new branch here, their agent, Mr. H. S. Milborrow, having commenced operations in April 1904. The business of several Persian merchants from Bushire is also said to be increasing rapidly, to the detriment to some extent of the Hindu traders who have for so many years been established in Manama and Moharrag. The German firm of Herr Robert Wonckhaus of Lingah and Bahrein was busy throughout the year, and it is believed that they contemplate opening another agency in Bushire at once. The demand for cotton textiles in Hassa is still increasing. This accounts for the large export of this material from Bahrein. The imports of rice were slightly less than in 1903. Stocks, however, at the end of the year were large. The closer supervision exercised by the Persian Customs authorities on small villages now, and the fact that Koweit has commenced to be served regularly by steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company from India are having an injurious effect upon the transit trade of Bahrein generally, and ia this commodity in particular. Of coffee the quantity imported was much smaller than usual until the latter part of tne year, when high prices in European markets showed signs of being maintained, merchants exhibited no inclination to order ahead large quantities, but held oli in the hope of a drop in prices. Consequently only sufficietit toi requirements at the close of the pearl-fishing season was imported. Stocks on hand at the close of the year were but small. Hit impoit of dates from Arab coast ports was considerably in excess of past years.^ It is estimated that 10 ,000 cwts. were on hand on 3ist December, a,waiting shipment to hgypt, Jeddah, and other Red Sea ports* The explana tion is that the caravan route beyond Hassa to the Red Sea is believed to be particularly unsafe this year. i ^ •' 1 he se f on ' s P^r!-fishing proved exceptionally good.

Returns for this local borne trade were promised by the authorities, but have not been received. 4. No comparisons are possible with returns of previous years, but all accounts agree that trade is increasing. 5. According to the figures, the imports exceed the exports by seven lakhs. To this excess, it misrht be considered necessary, to add the four lakhs of specie exported by British India steamers, but this figure has been given as equivalent to the produce of the Bahrein pearl fisheries to the credit of the Koweit pearling fleet. 6. Of these seven lakhs, three lakhs of rupees are required to pay for the arms and ammunitions imported, and it may be safely assumed that the money for payment comes not from Koweit at all, but from Persia and Turkey. 7. The only explanation received to account for the remaining four lakhs is that it comes from the Bedouins who sell the increase of their flocks and herds, camels and horses in Mesopotamia. Syria, the Hedjaz and even Egypt and come to Koweit for their yearly^ supplies. The explanation is given for what it is worth. It does not seem entirely satisfactory. S. G.

The Charitable Dispensary at Koweit was opened on the 30th October 1904. Medical treatment and advice are given free to all who come to the Dispensary from morning up to 1 p.m . The Dispensary remains open on all days except Fridays. 2. Erom the 30th October 1904 up to the 31st March 1905 the total number of patients treated was 3,976—of these 2,316 were men, 1,127 women and 533 children. The average daily attendance of patients during the same period was 82*13, being made up as follows :— Men 49*5, women 15*99, male children 9 91, female children 6*73. 3. When the Dispensary was first opened there was a great rush of patients partly due to the novelty of the thing which attracted a great number of people who had very trifling complaints only, and partly to there being a large number of Bedouins in the town at that time. Subsequently as the novelty of the thing wore off, the cold weather set in and the Bedouins went out of the town, the attendance fell off reaching its lowest level in February with a dailv attendance of 69 only, but after that, as the severity of the winter abated and caravans of Bedouins from the interior began to visit the town, the attendance began to rise again. 4. The total cost of medicines and surgical instruments supplied from the Bombay Medical Store Dep6t during the period was Rs. 873. 6 The dispensary establishment consists only of a sweeper, who is paid at the'rate of Rs. 10' per month. The contingent expenses of the Dispensary (including the pay of the sweeper) during the period amounted to Rs. 134-13-11. The postal peon, who came along with me from Bombay, has been also helping in the work of the Dispensary, and without him it would have been difficult to carry on the work with one sweeper only. 6 One hundred and eighty-one surgical operations have been performed during the same period; of these 24 were major and the rest minor. The maior operations consisted of excision of lymphatic glands, cysts, and tumouis, removal of necrosed bone, excision of internal piles^ evisceration of eyeball, site.160 ADMINISTEATION BEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 7. The diseases most commonly treated in the Dispensary were diseases of the eye, tubercular affections (including pulmonary phthisis, scrofula, tubercular diseases of bones, joints and skin ), affections of the digestive organs, rheu matic affections, intestinal worms, diseases of the skin, affections of the ear and venereal diseases. 8. Eye diseases. —The commonest forms of eye disease met with in this place are those of catarrhal and granular conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, and a number of affections resulting secondarily from the two latter, such as trichiasis, corneal opacity, pannus, staphyloma, etc. The chief causes which favour the prevalence of these diseases (which are primarily due to the action of micro-organisms) are the dry climate of the place with the prevalence of dust-laden winds, and th^ dirty habits of the people, whereby the infection is conveyed from one eye to another. Simple irritation of the eye is also caused by the use of salt water for washing, and new arrivals in the Gulf often suffer from such irritation. f J he number of blind people in this as in other places in the Persian Gulf is very large, in fact there is hardly any family in which there are not one or more blind members, the blindness being due either to senile cataract or some other affection of the eye. Eye affections are so common that the people look with utter indifference to such affections in their early stages and rarely seek for treatment until the eye is seriously damaged or totally lost. 9. Tubercular affections—AW. forms of tubercular diseases are extremely common. Pulmonary phthisis accounts for a large proportion of the mortality of this place. It is to be found at all ages except the very young. Scrofula is also very common, and though not rapidly fatal, gives rise to prolonired suffering, unsightly disfigurement, and finally kills by extension of the disease to the internal organs. Tubercular diseases of the bones, joints and skin are also common— the former often giving rise to fatal results from exhaustion brought on by prolonged suppuration. Ihe specific bacillus which gives rise to these diseases enters the body either through the food eaten or the air inhaled or through breaches of continuity in the skin. The common practice of eating together out of the same plate and drinking out of the same cup breach of which is looked upon as bad manners among the Arabs—favours the conveyance of the infection from one person to another. The dryness of the climate whereby the sputa of phthisical patients and the discharges of tuberculous sores are rapidly dried up and blown about with the wind also favours the spread of the diseases. The Negroes seem to possess less resisting power against pulmonary phthisis than the Arabs and succumb readily to the attack of the disease, but as regards scrofula the susceptibility of the Negroes and Arabs seems to be about equal. It is possible that in some cases tubercular diseases are conveyed to human beings through the milk or meat of diseased animals as no steps are taken to prevent the iTale of such articles, but at any rate this mode of conveyance plays a very unimportant part in the spread of the disease in comparison to the other methods. As to the nature of the food there seems to be a common notion among the people that fish eating conduces to scrofula. I do not think there is much truth in this, but 1 am inclined to believe tl.at fish diet supplies good pabulum for the development of the tubercle bacilli, because 1 have repeatedly seen the dis charge of scrofulous sores to increase in quantity and the granulations to assume an unhealthy character, after a fish diet. 10. Diseases of the digestive organs also very common. These are accounted for by the voracious appetite of the Arabs and the indiscriminate measure of their food. 3 he Bedouins also take food only half 5 or very improperly, cooked. j.he same causes combined with the habit of excessive coffee drinking give rise to oft repeated irritation and congestion of the liver and stagnation of blood in the portal vessels and thus favour the occurrence of piles and fistulas from which also the people of this place suffer very largely. The occurrence of these diseases is among the town-dwellers further*favoured oy their sedentary habits of life. The habit of excessive eating combined with excessive coffee-drinking, tobacco-smoking and undue sexual indulgence gives rise to another class of affections characterised by headache, lassitude, vertigo,iw ti.jji wii IM'II HI i-'i; 1 !

Soft chancre followed by suppurating bubo is uncommon. ir s is xr Epidemics-Ovlj one fatal case of cholera came under my notice in November last; although enquiries were made no reports about further authentic cases could be had. The disease did not prevail in an epidemic form; probably only afew sporadic cases occurred. - r v; 11 epidemic of measles broke out in February last and continued through March. I lie epidemic was pretty severe and generally accompanied with serious respiratory or intestinal complications. It accounted for a large number of deaths especially among children—chiefly from bronchopneumonia or noma. 16 Sanitation —The sanitary condition of the town is on the whole satisfactory, and in many respects better than that of other places in the Persian Gulf. There are no conservancy arrangements, but owing to the dryness of the climate and the proximity of the sea the occurrence of noxious eflPects from the decomposition of filth and refuse is to a great extent prevented. The people being very slightly advanced m the scale of civilisation have scant ideas of modesty, and use either the seashore, or the open plain, or the roofs of their houses or the sides of the lanes for latrine. In any case, however, the filth is either washed away by the sea twice a day or rapidly dried by the' sun and thereby rendered innocuous, and so this System is far better from a sanitary point of view than the system of well privies which is in vogue in Bushire and other places. Some people, however, are now beginning to con struct latrines in their houses, but the excreta are generally allowed to fall into buckets which are cleaned out daily in the sea. Some nice wooden latrines have also been erected lately on the seashore by the Sheikh and some of the leading merchants, in which the filth falls into the sea and is washed away by it, while at the same time the individuals are screened from public view. House refuse and dead animals are either thrown into the sea or in the roads.^ In the latter case they are allowed to rot where they lie and give rise to offensive smells. The sullage water of houses on the seaside is allowed to run into the sea—of those in the interior is either allowed to run on into the lanes or into pits dug in the courtyard. In either of these latter cases noxious smells are created, but as the soil is sandy and porous the water gets dried up soon. 17. Climate. —The climate of the place is dry and healthy. The last cold weather was exceptionally severe as in most other places, and several oases of death from sheer cold were reported both from sea and from land. The soil is sandy and porous with underlying rock. In the eastern and western parts of the town water is met with at a depth of from 10 to 15 feet, but in the central part which is on a rather higher level, it is met with at a depth of about 20 feet. The water of wells is very saltish and unfit for use, hence very few people dig wells in their houses. Water for use is brought from wells supplied by162 ^DMN. REPORT ON THE P, G.POL. RESY.

Mortality.—-Tbs mortality of the town is not high. The chief causes of death besides epidemics and accidents are pulmonary phthisis, chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, tubercular diseases of bones and joints, pneumonia, etc. The last as well as other lung affections are especially seen during the winter. Malarious fevers are very uncommon and such cases as are seen cau generally be traced to importation from other ports like Bussorah, Fao, Dillum, etc. The Arabs of this place generally live to good old age. This is partly due to the favourable climate and partly to the freedom of the Arabs from the high-pressure work and the excessive mental worries and anxieties of life in more civilised countries.
