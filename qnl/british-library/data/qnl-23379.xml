The Agency, Bahrain, Dated the 1 5til August . 193 2, From The Political Agent, BAHRAIN. To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to saj that certain tribes in Bahrain formerly enjoyed a considerable degree of inciependence and. it was their truculent behaviour and insistence on their independ ence that leiid to the expiiksicn of the Dowasir during _ajor Daly’s tour of duty here. 2# Since their reorganisation the Bahrain Government have consistently resisted these claims to independence. Indeed they are inconsistent tfith any degree of sovereignty for Bahrain-is too small to admit of any enclaves. A fresh instance of a claim to,at any rate,fiscal independence has recently come to light anc. it is this v^hich is the subject of my letter. 3. The Bahrain Government in search of fresh revenue recently imposed a Re.l/-per annum tax upon all fish traps. Muhammad bin Subah al Bin Ali of the Bin Ali tribe promptly produced certain documents,of which I enclose copies,under which he claimed exemption from all taxation and the Bahrain Government asked me wnether mere was any information forthcoming regarding tne matter on ay files. I caused a search to be made but nothing has been discovered since tne period related to about 1896 is not one covered by our records. It seems unlikely to me,however,tnat an action likely to have very far reaching effects could have been taken without a reference to Bushire and I would be glad if you would cause a search to be made and send me any information that is likely to be useful regarding the circumstances under which these- ® 7 r\ these undertakings were given. 4. Shaikh Usa was,ofcourse ? at the time precluded from making treaties with foreign powers without our concurrence but how far this would debar him Iran giving undertakings of this nature to tribal rulers is a matier on which I would be glad to learn the views of the hon T ble the Political ^sident. b. You will notice that two of the noeuments are said to have been signed by hr.Gaaki^but so far as i know the Agency iiad not^been created^and he may have signed tnem curing a temporary visit here. I have the honour to be Your ‘^ost Obeaient Servant Political Agent Bahrain.ao^'/(Tt&gt;ol 1932. British Residency &amp; Consulate-Greneral 4) Bushire, the 2 Dec ember 1932. To The Political Agent BAHRAIN SUBJECT t Claim for exemption of taxation by Muhammad bin Subah al bin Ali of the Bin Ali tribe. Memorandum . Please refer to Captain Priori letter ^o.898 of 15th August last on the above subject. I discussed the matter with Captain Prior when he visited Bushire subsequent to his letter, but without any conclusive result. I had intended discussing the matter with you on my recent visit to Bahrain, but owing to pressure of other matters, the general financial condition of the State, M over-side** delivery of cargo, and Shaikh Xaa*s death, I had no time to do so. 2. With regard to the enclosures to Captain Prior’s letter in which Muhammad bin Subah relies. In Enclosure 1, by which he - Shaikh Isa _ will treat the Bin Ali tribe with courtesy and generosity, etc. Shaikh Isa also confirms an agreement between Muhammad and Shaikh Khalil bin Ali. This does not seem in any way to support Muhammad bin Subah’s claim. Gaskin, undertakes that no taxes on the date gardens of the gVig 1 Vh Isa merely accedes to Muhammad* s request for an agreement In Enclosure 2^ Shaikh Isa, as instructed by Mr tribe • • • •- 2 - tribe shall be levied, and no diving fees shall be taken from them. The document says nothing about fish traps. Enclosure 2, with the addition of M such other privileges as were enjoyed by him and his tribal followers previously 1 *• 'dFith regard to this document. If the fish trap tax is a revival of an old form of revenue, there is nothing to show in the enclosures that the Bin Ali were exempt, and if it is a new tax then obviously they cannot argue old exemptions#if such ever existed* Moreover at the time of signing the document C11th December 1897) Shaikh Hamad was not of course Deputy Euler, and ao had no right to give any concessions whatever. 5. The matter raises some important issues and I would be glad if you would consult Mr.Belgrave and let me have your views. 4 Enclosure 3, given by Shaikh Hamad, merely confirmsPolitical Agency, Bahrain, the 21st January 1933 The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIPiiU SUBJECT*-Claim for exemption of taxation by Muhammad bin oubab &amp;1 bin Ali of the Bin-*Ali tribe. Msmor&amp;ndtufl please refer to your memorandum IT0.27CX) dated the 22nd December 1932# I will discuss the question of the claim of exemption from certain taxation made by Muhammad bin subah a 1 Bin- 1 /^!! of the Bln* * Ali tribe with Mr.Belgrave, but in the meantime I write to say that the matter seems certain to be a repercussion of the Zubarah incident of 1895* Agency, but some account of it appears in the pers'.fu Gulf Gazetteer, Volume I, Part I, Pages 923-926. The gift of documents of this sort would be accounted for by the Shaikh of Bahrain’s desire to placate the a 1 bin- 1 Ali, and the fact of Shaikh riamad having signed one of them would be likely to be connected with the succession difficulties mentioned on Pages 927 and 928. 3 . I cannot offer any useful opinion at the present stage, though personally I should be very dubious whether any undertakings which may have been given to the Al Bin-'Ali were anything more than a kind of safe-conduct. Moreover, from the dates I should say that they were given before our Naval action which led to the return of the a 1 Bin-'Ali to Bahrain, in which case they could hardly be regarded as valid, though it is quite possible that years of weakness by the Shaikh of Bahrain nay have invested them with some sanctity. There are no records of this incident in the Bahrain In the meantime, I write to ask if a search might be madewm &amp; 2 made among the Residency r ecorde connected with the Zubarah incident for possible papers which might show whether or not the Al Bin - 1 All were given any kind of promises which might reasonably be interpreted conferring exemption from such taxes as a fish trap tax. if A# J •Translation of atltttter dated tiie 13th.
