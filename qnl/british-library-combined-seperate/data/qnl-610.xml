The main correspondents include: the Political Resident Persian Gulf, Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf; Minister for Foreign Affairs of Persian Government.The file includes reports on two dhows that left Ajman on the Trucial Coast with food for pearl banks. They were stopped by the Persian Customs Director at Farur who confiscated rupees and pearls; it ordered the second dhow to proceed to Lingah with police on board. The dhow returned to Ajman and the Shaikh imprisoned the police; only the presence of a British ship prevented Ajman from sending an armed force. The Political Resident Persian Gulf noted that it was 'undesirable that Persian officials should correspond with Trucial Shaikhs'. Following discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Persian Government the matter was resolved and arrangements made for the Persian Custom Authorities at Bushire for transfer of the confiscated rupees. The file includes the Shaikh of Ajman's original letter in Arabic to the Residency Agent, Sharjah and English translation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ajman, Āl Nu'aymī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000100#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000100#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000100#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
