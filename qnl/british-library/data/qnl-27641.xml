POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, 20th November, 1949 To The Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Awali. Dear Sir, ^ v I am instructed by His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform you that in respect of the island of Arabi,Ris Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait is being addressed as follows by His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent there:- His Majesty's Government understand that the Saudi Arabian Government may be about to re-assert their claim to Arabi and possibly to take some action to enforce it. His Highness is reminded that while His Majesty's Govern ment have always taken the view that prima facie Arabi belongs to Kuwait, they have felt that Kuwait's claim is slender and have intimated to the Saudi Arabian Government that there might be discussion of the respective claims of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In the circumstances it would be difficult to take any effective action to resist any re- assertion of the Saudi claim. Embassy at Jedda has addressed the Saudi Arabian Government regarding Arabi as follows: His Majesty's Government have reason to believe that the Saudi Arabian Government have had brought to their attention the recent operations of the Bahrain Petroleum Company on the island of Arabi. They would therefore like to make their position clear to them in a frank and friendly manner. This island is claimed by His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. His Majesty's Government have no intention of taking any action 2 I am further to inform you that His Britannic Majesty's whatsoever-2- whatsoever to prejudice the status of this Island or the division of the sea-bed. They are ready to discuss this subject at any time. They suggest that no obstacle should be placed in the way of Bahrain Petroleum Company proceeding with their work on the island which is not intended to result in the production of oil there at all. His Majesty^ Govern ment assure the Saudi Arabian Government that the continuation of this work will not be used in any way as an argument in favour of the claim of Kuwait to the island in question. 3. His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait has been informed of the communication which has been made to the Saudi Arabian Government. Yours faithfully, H.B.M's PoVltical Agent. olo/ia (o^ © CCKFUr.rTlAL .

Dated, 11th April, 1950 J/Thany 22, 1369 y?* Prom The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahra in. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, 4 I Qp I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaildi Sulman has Instructed me to reply to your letter No. C/L-127 dated 28th March, 1950, on the subject of the Baina Islands. 2m These two islands are and always have 'been part of the territory of Bahrain. His Highness regards the action of the Government of Saudi Arabia in erecting a concrete slab and bronze plaque on each of the two islands as a definite act of aggression by sea against territories regarded by His Highness as his own. As His Majesty's Government is liable according to treaty to protect the Bahrain Government from aggression by sea and as the Ruler of Bahrain has placed in the hands of His Majesty's Government the right to represent him in dealing with other states His Highness earnestly requests His Majesty's Government to protect him against this encroachment on his territories by causing the Saudi Arabian Government to remove the erections which they have put up on the islands. r f ^ ^.§6t * ■ ■ i-2- tV* (3) 3. The Baina islancls were at one time, a^out 70 years ago, coneideratiy larger than they are today, since then the sea has covered parts of the islands which used to he ahove the high water level. When the islands were larger than they are now they were a 'breed ing place for turtles which came ashore during the period of the 'Bara' wind, in June and part of July. The Bu Palas trihe, of Hedd, were allowed toy Shaikh Isa, the Ruler of Bahrain, to visit the islands in order to catch turtles and to obtain turtle eggs. It was the custom of these people to go to the islands during the season and to live there in tents and huts while fishing, they obtained their water supplies from the sutomarine spring of Sharaiha which is situated off the coast opposite Barhar. The use of the islands at that time was forbidden except to people who obtained permission to go there from Shaikh Isa. There are descendants of people who were engaged in catching turtles on the Baina islands alive in Bahrain today. Neither at that time nor at any time subsequently did the inhabitants of what is now Saudi Arabia visit the islands or make use of them for fishing or for any other purpose. 4. After some years it seems that the turtles ceased from coming to the islands to lay their eggs and the people of Hedd gave up going there. The islands however are prolific fishing grounds and in addition they contain valuable deposits of guano. For the last twentyfive years and probably for longer, people from Bahrain, from Budeya and Barbar, which are the nearest villages on the coast of Bahrain to the Baina islands, have been trap fishing and removing guano from the Baina islands. Nobody from Jlaudi Arabia has set traps-3- (§) traps at the Bainas nor have they removed any of the guano deposits. The Government gardens at Budeya and Jida and the Yateem garden at Barhar have been supplied with manure mainly from the guano of the Baina islands. In the case of Jida and Budeya, since the prison was established at Jida in 1940, prisoners, in charge of police, have 'been employed in 'bringing guano to the Government gardens. All this time nohody from Saudi Arabia has gone to the islands or made any objection to their use by Bahrain. 5. In 1936 the Bahrain Government erected stone beacons on all the islands belonging to Bahrain includ ing the two Baina islands. The beacons were large and visible from a long distance, they were made of stone and cement and had numbers painted on them. They were erected by the Public Works Department. 6. Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Sulman bin Daij Alkhalifah, a member of the Ruling family, holds a docu ment, a copy of which, with a translation, is enclosed. The document which is dated 1296 Hejira, about 73 years ago, is for the sale of a portion of the sea between the west coast of Bahrain up to the shore of what is now Saudi Arabia, opposite the coast of Bahrain. During his lifetime Shaikh Sulman bin Daij used to let the fish ing rights in this part of the sea to the Dawasir of Budeya and to the Bu Palas and Bu Lahej families of Hedd. The leases were written by Almas A1 Habshi, one of Shaikh Isa's slaves who dealt with many of Shaikh Isa's affairs. Sulman bin Daij died and according to the family custom, his property reverted to the Ruler. Shaikh Isa took over the fishing rights but it appears that he —4—5— he did not continue to let them, tout retained the fish ing in his own hands. 7. Last summer, 1949, Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah went to Nejd. He took with him the document and dis cussed the matter with His Majesty King Ihn Saud. Ibn Saud, according to Shaikh Ali hin Khalifah, hinted at some sort of 'compensation' and made various remarks such as 'alhalaal wahad' (our property is in common). The king pointed out that there was no seal of a ruler or Qadi on the document. At the time that the document was written however there was no Government in Saudi Arabia other than the Turks whose authority was more or less limited to the coastal settlements and the A1 Humaid tribe was the ruling tribe on the strip of coast referred to in the document. Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah told the King that any matter of compensation would have to be dealt with by His Highness Shaikh Sulman. The island of Chus Chus is within the boun daries described in the document. The facts about the purchase of the sea in the neighbourhood of the Baina islands are given here in order to show that 70- year s ago the Khalifah owned he* not only the sea between Bahrain and the islands but the sea extending from the islands up to what is now the Saudi Arabian coast. 8. On July 29, 1913 a convention was signed between the United Kingdom and Turkey. The following is quoted from Article 13 of the Convention. 'The Imperial Ottoman Oovernment renounce all their claims with regard to the Bahrain Islands, including the two islets of Lubainatel Aliya and Lubainat-es-Safliya, and recognise the inde pendence of that country. His Britannic Majesty^ Government on their part declare that they have no intention of annexing the Bahrain islands to their territory.'Article 14 reads 'His Britannic Majesty's Government give an undertaking to the Imperial Ottoman Government that they will guard against the Shaikh or Bahrain levying from Ottoman subjects dues on pearl gishing at a higher rate than that imposed on other interested and most favoured parties. w The Convention was never ratified hut it is evi dent that at that time His Majesty^ Government re garded the islands as belonging to Bahrain, Since then there has been no use of the islands or occu pation of the islands by any Government other than the Bahrain Government. 9. His Highness believes that the action of the Saudi Arabian Government in erecting structures on the Baina islands was done with the intention of gain ing as much ground as possible in order to be in a more favourable position when the time comes to settle both boundary questions and the question of the North Jarim area. If such action is allowed to pass the domains of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain will gradually become engulfed by neighbouring states. The matter is one of very great importance as far as the future of Bahrain is concerned. His Highness has at present nobody to rely upon except His Majesty^ Govern ment for the protection of his rights and his domains and he therefore requests His Majesty^ Government to protect his rights. I have the honour to be, Sir, ^ Your obedient servant.

I regret that there was a mistake in ray previous letter, the Arabic name of 'Rennie Shoal' is NAIWAT AR*RAGAIE not Hagool, the latter shoal is between Jarim and Nauwat A^Ragaie. The Preliminary Chart, Persian Gulf, approaches to Ras-At-Tannura (1939) shows a shoal North West of Abu Saafa as RETLAWENNA, this word, read backwards, is Anne Walter. I think it may possibly have been named by a Mr. Walter Millar of Bapco and Aramco whose son and daughter were called Anne and Walter. The Arabic name of the shoal is Ghariba. I would like to suggest that the shoals around Bahrain should be given their proper Arabic names in all official charts. C AY. ser to the Government. \h^ | J LjAAS.

Amongst other things it would encourage them to use it in the dispute over the sea-bed boundary between Bahrain and Qatar where as you no doubt remember they actually carried out survey operations inside *atar territorial waters, 2. The fact that they have made this plea makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for me to press the Foreign Office to reconsider their attitude regarding the company's request to be permitted to carry out an early survey of the sea north of the Bu Sa'afah shoal, I enclose a copy of the telegrams exchanged with the Foreign Office on this subject and if you see no object- ion would be grateful if you would inform the company on the lines proposed in Foreign Office telegram No. 230 of the 20th May.lojio 13 THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY, LIMITED bahrein jscxmh, persian gulf / /' -&gt; u e. a. skinner VICE PRESIDENT 31st May, 1950. Mr. C. J. Pelly, The Agency, MiNA.Mil, Bahrein. Dear Mr. Pelly, Thank you for your letter No, C/L-200 of 29th May, 1950 regarding our 'Company^ proposal to ask Hunting Aerosurveys to make an aerial survey of the sea north of Bu Saafa shoal.' As explained to you over the telephone yesterday, it is quite evident that there is a misunderstanding regarding both the nature and the location of the work proposed. The nature of the work is simple aerial photography and not a real aerial survey. Our intention was (1) - to photograph the sea bed to assist in selecting a drilling location when the boundary dispute is settled. (2) - recording existing structures that have been built by our Company and others. The location of the proposed work was not North of Bu Saafa shoal, but South . The area outlined to you over the telephone yesterday was as follows ^ a) - Northern boundary - 27° N. Latitude. b) - Western boundary - 50 o 20 f E. Longitude. ^ c) - Eastern boundary - 50 ol K) f E. Longitude approx. d) - Southern boundary not fixed but the photographs would take in part or all of Fasht al Jarim and might extend southward to cover the northern part of Bahrein Island. We consider the area defined above is covered by the Company^ Concession. We do not consider that the proposed aerial photography could in any sense be termed exploration for oil. •3. ,3&lt;2.Mr. C. J. Pelly. - 2 - 31st May, 1950. Both Mr. Van Benschoten and I talked to you about the proposed aerial photography and in those conversations we referred to the North Jarim Are^and the Northern Area. It is quite understandable that these references were mis leading to you. We sincerely hope that you have been caused no embarrassment because we feel that we should have described the area sufficiently explicitly that there could have been no misunderstanding.

J} £.3 ? ^Copy of a note addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government. 2^ @) (After Compliments) In presenting the note it is proposed to deal only with those islands in the Persian Gulf the sovereignty over which is in dispute between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Shaikh- doms under the protection of K.M.G. namely Farsi, Arabi and Bainah. A separate note has already been addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government on the subject of the frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the Shaikhdoms on the mainland and further communications relating to the division of the sea-bed between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and the activities of Ibn Mansur are in preparation. 2. H.M.G. desires firstly to reassure the Saudi Arabian Government that it Is indeed their wish to re?ch a Just and equitable settlement of all questions relating to islands in the Persian Gulf at present outstanding between the two O Governments and that they are not irrevocable committed to supporting the claims of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with out regard to any evidence that the Saudi Arabian Government may produce in support of its claims. The Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait have, however, produced to H.M.G. what would appear to be strong evidence in support of their claims that the islands in question are part of their territories, and, until such tme as the evidence on which the Saudi Arabian Government base their counter claims to these islands becomes available H.M.G. are unable to reach any final conclusion in the matter although meanwhile they are bound to support the claims of the two ^ Shaikhs. It is for this reason that they have asked the Saudi Arabian Government to lay this evidence before them. Had H.M.G. taken the view that these questions allowed of no doubt what soever they would not have agreed, as they h«ve done, to enter into discussions with the Saudi Arabian Government about them. 3. K.M.G. are anxious that all outstanding questions between ^ the two Governments should be settled at an early date and they ^ share the Saudi Arabian Government's desire that discussions shall be on a 'practical and realistic basis'. To this end they propose that each Government should now prepare a 'memoran dum claim' setting out detailed evidence on whicl its claims to the islands Farsi, Arabi and Bainah are based. They fur ther propose that these memoranda should be exchanged two months before the day appointed for the opening of the discus sions, and that in order to allow a suitable period of time both for the preparation of the memoranda and for considera* tion of their substance the discussions should begin on or about 20th November, 1960. 4. In the opinion of H .M .G. the discussions could most conveniently be held in Bahrain where H.M^ Political Resident and His Highness Shaikh Salman would welcome receiving repre sentatives whom the Saudi Arabian Government might appoint for the purpose. (Usual ending)! Copy of a note addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government. &gt;&lt;r S (After Compliments) It has come to the notice of H.M.G. that the Saudi Arabian Government have caused plaques to be fixed to certain light beacons lying within the disputed areas of the Bahrain- Saudi Arabian sea-bed around Fasht Bu Saafah (as defined In H.M, Embassy 's note No. 41 of 8th April, 1950). These plsgpws bear In Inscription stating that the beacons to which they are affixed are In Saudi Arabian territory. H.M.G. further learn that the Saudi Arabian Government have caused a mark of sovereignty to be erected on the Island of Arabl. These actions have been taken at a time when discussions between the two Governments on the status of Arabl and On the division of the sea-bed are pending. H.M.G. do not know whether any other foreign organisation was consulted In regard to these action^, but are compelled to point out that no British authority of any kind was con sulted In spite of the fact that the Saudi Arabian Government well knew that such abjects were a matter of gre^t concern to H.M.G. 2. If the questions outstanding between H.M.G. and the Saudi Arabian Government are to be settled by friendly discussions, It is clearly essential that neither party should take, or encourage others to take, any action hastening to prejudice such a settlement. An undertaking to this effect was given in H.M.Embassy 1 s note of 2nd November 1949 and has been scrupulously fulfilled by H.M.G. 3. The Saudi Arabian Government on the other hand have not exercised the same restraint but have, even while discussions have been proceeding with H .M .G., repeatedly taken unilateral action of a kind calculated to prejudice settlement of the dis putes. Erection of the markers of sovereignty on Arebl and in the 'disputed areas' referred to above, follows on similar ac tion In respect of disputed Farsl and Balnah. H.M.G. have more than once protested to the Saudi Arabian Government against such actions and have, in their note of 16th April, 1960, urged the Saudi Arabian Government to refrain from any repetition of them. In these circumstances, and In order that the actual existence of the mark of sovereignty should not be allowed in any, way to prejudice the outcome of the discussions between the two Governments H.M.G. have had no alternative but to give instructions for the immediate removal of any mark of Saudi Arabian sovereignty which has been, or maytte erected on the islands of Farsl, Arabl and Bainah, or In the disputed areas of the Bahrain-Saudi Arabian sea-bed while discussions on these questions are pending. 4. H.M.G. wish nevertheless to emphasise that they remain willing to enter Into discussions about the questions at issue with an open mind, and In the most cordial possible spirit, and that they look forward to an early settlement in accordance with the close and friendly relations which they have so long enjoyed with the Saudi Arabian Government.
