While still talking with Sagar, Mr* Soofl returned with the report that the Sheikh was coming over Immediately to see me* In a few minutes the Sheikh arrived and appealed to me to withdraw my objection to the departure of his sons as everything had been arranged, and everybody knew they had arranged to e'cart that day and that he would be disgraced If the arrangement was altered etc.,etc. Finally the Sheikh said he had written to Bin Saud saying that his sons Hamad and Abdullah would start on Saturday, wind permitting, to pay him a private visit* I reminded the Sheikh that since I had been here I had tried to work with him In a friendly way and not to worry him with advice on all sorts of matters and that I was sorry and naturally not pleased to find that he had disregarded my advice In this mat ter. But as he had written to Bin Saud that his sons were going I thought that they had better go, to avoid possible Ill-feelingJ at the same time I had mentioned the matter to you In my last letter, and did not know what you would think of his having written to Bin Saud definitely arranging the visit without con sulting me. The Sheikh said that the visit was quite Private and his sons only went as he had always been on friendly terras Bin Saud etc., that It had no political motive, aftd that he thought It better to get It over In case the Turks might soon be sending gunboats to Katlf• It la/very unusual thing for the Sheikh here to come and see the Political Agent and,practically he never comes except on p 4 arrival and departure and King*a Birthday etc.j ( I do not knot A how this custom arose, but I think It should be changed when there Is a younger Sheikh): It was therefore very much agalm the grain that the Sheikh came yesterday and aakoa me to witCD draw ray objection.

Sheikh Abdullah said Ahmed bin Thneyan intended to oatoh last mail but missed it, and will leave for Busreh by this mailt he added that Ahmed has letters and messages for the Turkish Authorities from Bin Saud* It is beliewed that Ibrahim bin Daiauq and possibly UUsad bin Suwellim who is still here will aooompanj him* Sheikh Abdullah also informed me that Bin Saud will probably leave Katif for Hasa today leaving one of the Bu Suwellim clan as his 'ifaib* at Katif# I think there is no doubt Bin Saud is actively engaged in safe guarding his own Interests with the Turks, without waiting for any answer from the Government to his overtures. I do not know whether H«ii.

These were sent by him to Bahrein by the hand of his former emis sary. Bin Saud commences with a reference to the long-stand ing friendship which has existed between the British Govern ment and his house, and to the agreement of 55 years ago entered into by his grand father - presumably the declaration dated April 21tt, 1866, and given to Colonel Pelly. He goes on to complain of the facilities which he al leges were afforded to the Turks by the Political Agent in allowing them to use Bahrein as their base of operations. He is most anxious, he continues, to preserve the long standing friendship between us and on his part undertakes to ensure that protection and good treatment are accorded to British subjects, and desires that we should give him similar assurances. If, however, the position has changed and we no longer wish to continue the friendly relations of the past (which he says he is most anxious th4t we should continue) he asks that he may be warned explicitly in order that he may be able to take steps to safeguard his own interests.

(Translation.) Dated 8th Rajab 1331 (13th June 1913). From— Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Favsal es Saud, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire. After enquiries after your esteemed health. We beg to address your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grandfather Faysal-—may God forgive him—of the period of which fifty-five years have e'apsed and fifty-five years stiil remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have now-a days conquered the country of our fathers and grand fathers {mz), El Hasa and El Qatif, as well as their dependencies and spared the soldiers remaining there, sending them over to Bahrain because it was more convenient for them to make their way to Basrah from that place. When they reached Bahrain, however, they were assisted by some one from your side and he afforded them the necessary facilities and encouraged them to stay at Bahrain and to cause trouble in our side. We received the news of this but we did not believe it because your wisdom and justice would not agree to this. After a few days they set out from Bahrain for El Qatif but they returned in disappointment and remained for several days, having no supporter but your subjects and dependents. A few days afterwards they pro ceeded towards El Ojair and on their arrival there they experienced such a disas ter at the hands of a small party of our dependents as had not crossed their minds and they returned disappointed and repentant. Praise and thanks be to God that we do not attach the least importance or significance to them or rather to them and to the party to whom they are connected. Yes, we, the Islamic and Mohammedan Arabs, will rise to uphold our honour and will recover our rights with the last drop of our blood and we are doing this with confidence in the One Single God and also in all our Moslem brethren. We all have joined hands and there is no difference between us, we having been joined together by the cause of Islam and by the Arab sense of honour. In view of my friendly feelings I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors and (I desire that those terms) should exist between me and you after them, (my ancestors). If the relations are as before and If it is Incumbent upon both the parties to protect the subjects, we bind ourselves to you in regard to those who are in our side and to what concerns your subjects, and we will respect their honour,' protect them and be responsible for them—because there remain certain people in our side who are against you and your subjects, and we ask for similar treatment from you. If this be really the case in view of the past friendship and of laws, please give us an intimation accordingly, and if the conditions are changed and the situation is not as we expect, then please warn us, so that we may be cognisant of the same. And thanks be to God, the Lord of both the Worlds and may his peace be on our Lord, Mohammed, his posterity and companions. Greetings.

I hare now received their reply. I am authorised to inform Your Honour that the reports which seem to have reached you to the effect that our Agent at Bahrain, Major Trevor gave facilities to the Turkish Troops while halting at Bahrain, were not true. Their stay at Bahrain on this occasion was unavoid able under the circumstances, but no assistance was given them. Secondly, I am to explain that your expression of friendly feelings towards them is appreciated by the British Government, but that they do not see their way to intervene in any way m the dispute which has arisen between Your Honour and the Turkish Government. On the contrary, the British Govern ment consider it necessary to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards both sides. This was the message of Government, and I beg to add an expression of my own appreciation of the friendly sentiments which you evince towards this Residency, and also of the kind hospitality and assistance you have been good enough to accord to English travellers who have passed through the spheres of your tribes.

His Majesty's Secretary of State for India is of the opinion that Captain Shakespear was ill-advised m proceeding to so great a distance beyond the limits claimed by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and I am to say that it should be clearly understood in future that the tours of the Political Agent must, unless otherwise directed by the Government of India, be confined strictly to the limits eventually assigned to Kuwait under the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

A.C., v /hen I paid you a visit laat ' ime in Bahrein in the beginning of Janadi I, 1331, I spoke to Yusuf Kanoo to in form you about Protection^ as you are no doubt aware of our oiroumatanoes with tho nomadic tribes, and the non-defenoe by our Ottoman Government for us# Yusuf Kanoo mentioned to me that you had promised him the result after making a re ference and according to which I wrote a letter to Yuauf Kanoo asking him to request you to let him know the result. He then wrote me a letter telling me that the result was not yet obtained. Doubtless you know that in these days the Wahabl Abdul Aziz bin Saud had laid his hand on Hasa and Katif and the Ottoman n Ooverment have power to attack Katif and up till now we have been in absolute danger between the two aides. I have there fore to ask and request the favour of your placing a hand of protection din us as we are in a great disturbed condition and discomfort at present. You know of course the territory I am in, is Saihat and most of her inhabitants belong to Bahrein, and most of then are pearlers and pearl merchants and moat of their trade is with Bahrein people. Vie have come to know that if the Ottonan covemment attack Katif they will do a great molestation and therefore several lives will bo lost besides property? I for my ownself cannot leave Saihat at the present moment in order to come to you and speak in this respect. I have written and sent this letter with a trustworthy and reliable man Haji Ali bin Hamud who is one of the principal residents of the town. In conclusion I beg to request your favour and your old kindnesses to keep an eye of kindness on us, because affairs are embarrassing. I ask from r»od the help and protection.I request you will favoulj rne with a reply by bearer Ha^i All and I am at your service for anything you may require of me. Usual Ending,30th May 1913. Uv; 7 Please see your deni-official letters of the 18th and 27th May on the subject of the protection of the Shaikh of Saihat and his-people, I return the enclosures to the former letter with transla tions. It does not appear to me that we 'can possibly protect him in any way. He is an Ottoman subject and as you will see from his letter, he has evidently participated in some form, in negotiations between the Turks and Bin Saud and is under suspicion. While this fact accounts for his apprehensions, it also makes it the more evident that we cannot properly make any response to his overtures. If any other reason on which we could base a pretext for helping him occurs to you or Yusuf Kanoo strong enough to put up, do so, but short of that, I do not think any action by us in possible. Major A.P. Trevor, C.I.E, Political Agent, - Bahrein. 7 (\ \u '•'zA J v I* u(= 8th May 1913). From The Shaikh of Salhat. To Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, Bahrein, A.C. I trust that you are keeping well. We have heard from a member of our community, who had been present in your house, that he had heard the Command ant and the Government Officials accusing us and stating that the first person who offered submission and brought about this situation was this humble. By the Almighty God and His Merfiiful Prophet, this remark was nothing but a false charge, accusation and misrepresentation by enemies. When Bin Saud's party arrived, I was in the meeting of the Governor of Qatif and the Governor ordered me to go out to Saihat for the purpose of defending the town, requesting me to obtain news about Bin Saud's party and communicate the same to the Governor. My visit to Bin Saud's expedi tion was (made) by order of the Governor and I learned their intention and communicated it to the Governor and though the man whom I had sent with a letter to the Govern or was searched by the Zuz Bashi in the hope that there may be other letters with him for other persons, nothing was found on him and no room was therefore left for any accusation. I have not visited Bin Saud's expedition after the first time. Repeated rumours were being received by us that all the inhabitants of Qatif had decided on peace and submission to Bin Saud's expedition while we remained negligent. It is obvious to your honour that•submission to Bin Saud was not prompted by his loyalty to the Government but meant remainingremaining under humiliation to him, because he had threatened them with an attack and with the destructi^r! of lives, plunder of properties and violation of thei honomr. You know that the people of Qatif are helpless and have no power to defend themselves, Ytfien the people of the desert are unable to set themselves free from their (Bin Saud's ) yoke, how can these (Qatif people) be able to defend themselves against Bin Saud and his hosts? So be it known to you that their submission was against their will. Intelligent persons like you know what others do not understand. I beg of you to visit the Commandant and the Governor's staff, explain to them the facts of the case and dispel from their minds the doubts which they entertain about us and of which we are innocent. In any case, we are the slaves of the Government and you are our representative both in our presence and absence, and we depend on you in all circumstances. Enclosure . I beg of you to keep the secret and not to allow this lett er to be seen by any one except proper individual, as it is said secrets are freemen's trusts'. Everyone has his enemies and friends and a hint is sufficient to one like you. I request you to inform me of the intention of the soldiers who have arrived at Bahrein from A1 Hassa and Qatif and of what you learn concerning their future movements. My brother I think that the time has arrived for the matter about which I spoke with you, because the affairs are in a disturbed condition. Please let us know what you think advisable.Oonfldentlal Bahrein, 14th July 19IS* With refor&amp;nc© to para 834 of th© alary for this week regarding Haji Abdul Hmseln bin Jtom, I h«r© to re port that after his arrival in Bahrein* this individual who is on© of the principal aerohante in Katif, sent a message to rae saying that the inhabitants of Katif were much troubled by Bin Baud's exactions etc. and wished to ask the British Go vernment to take them under its protection. I informed hie messenger that Katif was recognised by the British Government as belonging to Turkey, and that in my opinion the Qowernment could not interfere In the manner suggested, in the dispute between the Turks and Bin Saud. I added that I was sure the answer to his request would be in the negative. The inter mediary pressed the point a good deal, espeoially with a view to my reporting Haji Abdul Husein'e request to you, and this 1 agreed to do.

He addressed the Shaikh of Qatar, while he was at Qatif, demanding that the Turkish garrison should be driven out from A1 Bida*. (2). From Kuwait. Qasr-as-Subaih has been occupied by him. (3). From the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast. A conference has taken place betv/een the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai, who are of the same tribe, and the for- mer, whose porition has become paramount in Baraimi and the vicinity since the Wahhabis withdrew, considers it certain that the activities of Bin Saud will be directed towards that locality. Fearing this it has been decided by the two Shaikhs that they will mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakht Matti, (Reference is invited to Lorimer's Gazetteer page 1200) and take tbe initiative against him. I should not think that Bin Saud would consider it was worth while to alienate His Majesty's Government by taking such a course as there was nothing of an unfriend ly nature in our reply to his communication; but at the same time, if he wishes to do so, an extremely favourable opportunity is afforded to him by the present state of Oman. The Shaikhs are being warhed by me that such a de velopment is improbable, and deterred from making thefirst hostile move, but, if be glad to reassure them as possible enterprise such as Saud which would be adopted (j I it is feasible, I should to the attitude towards a this on the part of Bin by His Majesty's Government.

Letter No.29150 dated 2nd of July from the foreign Office'to the India Office has been received in blue print. I note that a more benevolent standpoint is a a sura ed in the Secretary of State 1 s telegram dated 3rd of July, and I appreciate the pcttinence of the policy indicated therein to the full; but as regards the Foreign Office letter I venture to urge that adequate cognisance is hard ly taken of the fact that no control can be exercised by the Porte over Bin Saud at any rate for a long time to come, and that in the meantime his position affords him an opportunity of causing a very great amount of inconve nience to the Indian Government in Oman, on the Trucial Coast and in Qatar, which would be obviated by a harmless modus vivendi, which could be arranged, if necessary, with the knowledge of the Turkish Government, ^o question ari ses of any destine to interfere in Central Arabian politics. Bin Saud is now at the coast, and a new menace threatens our interests in the Gulf sphere; it is necessary for us either to render it harmless or to take steps for our pro- tection against it. Purely no logical reason exists why, because the Turkish Government is incapable of control ling one of her proteges, the interests of ours should suffer severely. Perhaps His Majesty's Government could be moved to a further consideration of this aspect of the question, if my apprehensions are shared by the Government of India.(0 0 Telegram - P, From - Foreign, Cimia.

'Jm of July, in regard to ^in Saudj on August 10th the secre- .,W ' ■ ■ ' ; ' tary of Jtats was telegraphed to as follows:- Begins. 'With reference to your telegram dated 6th of August. Some difficulty is experienced by us in expressing our opinion on the telegram from Cox, dated July 30th in con sideration of the policy which has been explicitly laid down by His Majesty's Government regarding Bin Saud. We consider, however, that it is our duty to lay before His Majesty's Government the very strong objections to which, in the changed state of affairs, a rigid adherence to that policy is, in our pa opinion, open. From the relations which exist between Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Ai Qatar and the recent reports regarding the apprehensions of the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast, it is clear that he is assuming as ever increasing prominence in the politics of the Coast of the Persian Gulf, and has thus brought him self within the sphere in which lie our interests and in fluence. ^in Saud could be ignored with impunity as long as his operations were confined to Ai 11asa. We do not, however, think that it is safe to pursue such a policy now that there is a possibility that he will interfere in Qatar, with the chiefs of the Trucial Coast, and even, it may be, in Oman where an opportunity of encroaching on the territories of the Sultan may be afforded to him by the rebellion. It appears to us, therefore, that his conci liation or estrangement must now be decided upon. The latter effect cannot but be produced if Bin Saud is threatened JI of® threatened without further parley with forcible expulsion if he makes any attempt to interfere in the affairs of A1 Qatar, while we should be compelled to undertake military operations, a c oonsutomatlom which it is very desi rable to avoid, if he were to ignore our threat. Unless some mu tual and amicable agreement can be arrived at with the Amir who has up to the present displayed a friendly spirit towards us, it is probable that we shall force him to take up an attitude of permanent hostility which cannot but react on the chiefs of the Gulf Coast in an unfavourable manner. Under these circumstances we strongly advocate, not any definite treaty with Bin Gaud, but a friendly in terchange of views in the course of which it would be in timated to him that we should expect him to forbear from interference with the territories of chiefs on the Gulf littoral with whom we have treaty or other relations. No reason is apparent to us why we should run any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities arousing their sus picions if this were done with the full knowledge of the Turkish Government to whom a clear explanation of our in tentions could be given. The Trucial Chiefs might be seriously warned not to take any provocative action against the Amir; and also be informed that our relations with the Amir are such that they have no grounds for their fears of aggression on his part; we suggest this instead of any assurance of immunity from him which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him. A telegram from Vox which has just been received ad vocating a policy on similar lines is being repeated to you M . Hinds. The telegram to which reference is made in the last sentence is your semi-official dated 7th of August. The Secretary of State wires as follows in roply. Begins.Begins, 101 'With reference to your telegram dated August 10th on the subject of Bin Saud. The considerations which you urge have impressed His -''ajesty's Government who approve of your proposed line of action, but should Bin Saud ask for our support against Turkey in return for compliance with our wishes, it must be clearly explained to him that an attitude of strict neutrality will be maintained by % Eis Majesty's Government though they are willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation bet ween him and the Turkish Government. Hakki has been in formed verbally of our intentions and has received them well. Whan the terms of your communication to Bin Saud are known the Porto will be addressed in writing, ^ou should bear in mind the last sentence but one of Article XI of the Anglo-Turkish Convention in regard to A1 Qatar'/ ^ou are requested to act in this sense, Please te legraph the terms of your communication to Bin Saud for* approval before sending it.

The communication to Bin Saud suggested In my latter above mentioned was prompted by a desire to give effect to what tha Marquess of Orewa conceived to be the policy of Sir E. Grey. That it might have tha affect indicated by the Government of India was obvious, and that His Lordship has all along realised that it is impossible in practice to ig nore Bin Saud may be seen from my lattax- of 4th June, while his preference for friendly relations with the Amir was shown in the draft telegram enclosed in my latter of 2nd July. The case is now so cogently put by Sir P. Oox and tha Govern ment of India that he ventures to invite some further con sideration of tha position in tha light of their remarks, with which he entirely concurs. His Majesty's Government are now under a treaty obligation to Turkey to maintain the rule of tha successors of Shaikh Jasim in 31 Qatar, and Lord Orawa would suggest that this fact might be made the occasion for a friendly communication to the Turkish Government through Hakki Pasha. It might be pointed out to His Hs-ighness that, owing to the death of Shaikh Jasim and subsequent events. His Majesty's Government, in order to carry(ft carry out that obligation, must make Bin Saud either their friend or their enemy; that thei' cannot afford (for the reaaona given by the Government of India) to maite hirn their enemy; and that they fcMEaSaEa therefore propose to enter into a friendly exchange of viewa with him in order to regularise the position. It muat of course be realised that Bin Saud, in return for a friendly attitude towards ua, may ask for our support againat Turkey. It will be neceaaary then to majte it clear to him that his Majesty's Government, while willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation, cannot undertake to support him, but must maintain the atricteat neutrality.

He having informed me that he would be returning coastwards after Octobe^ 611 ^ teleg3 p lm ^ o * i? 0 !, dated 23id thef'Id-ul-Haj (10th November) I wrote c 0 . e ? . to him on the 27th October saying that I intended to be at Bahrain on or about the 18th November and hoped he would make it convenient to meet me at Ojair on or about the 2 lst 3 and that I would expect news of his movements on arrival at Bahrain. The same day that I reached Bahrain however a messenger came in from Bin Saud with a letter saying that my letter had found him in Qasim at too great a distance to admit of the possibility of reaching Ojair by the 21st November, but that he was hurrying in and begged me to meet him on the 10th Muharram at Ojair. This it is impossible to do without missing the mail by which I have arranged with the permission of Government to proceed on leave, but if this meeting is to take place at all it is urgent that it should be brought off as soon as possible, and I therefore instructed Major Trevor verbally to undertake it in my behalf accompanied by Captain Shakespear. I beg^to attach a copy of my letter in that connection to Bin Saud and of the * £ sailing directions ' which I have handed to Major Trevor, and I trust that higher authority will see nothing in them to which exception can be taken. 3. I also enclose for the information of the Government of India a copy of No. C.-24, dated 18th NovcnW. a ^ fr , om Shakespear stating according to current rumour, the nature of the terms which the Porte hopes to make with Bin Saud. It seems to me that the final item, if the report proves well-founded, is one to which we should take exception, if it is contemplated to leave Bin Saud iu control of Katif and Gjair, and I therefore venture to recommend that a timely decision he arrived at as to the course we should take for the protection of our interests in case the present report, in regard to this item, is confirmed. The Government of India will not have forgotten the correspondence which has passed in recent years regarding the representation of our commercial in terests at Katif and the continued desire of British Indian traders to settle there. Our right to he represented has been recognized in principle and, apart from the capitulations, there seems no reason we should tolerate and fresh an un friendly compact between the Porte and Bin Saud, to the continued prejudice of our rights and interests in this connection. Memorandum setting forth the position the time of the contemplated It is highly important to have in mind to start with a clear understanding the policy of His Majesty's Government towards Turkey resulting from recent developments of the general political situation in Europe and the Middle East; on which policy the attitude of Government towards the question of Bin Saud and his relations with the Turks is based. The family having been relegated to Central Arabia for the last 40 years odd, the present (Amir ?) has lately ejected the Turkish garrisons from the Al Hasa sanjak and coast and descended to the shores of the Persian Gulf where he is in de facto control of the ports of Katif, Ojair and other small posts. As long as he continues in that position, practically independent of any control, he2 is a danger to GUI' general interests in the Gulf and to our relations with thp Arab Principalities, unless we have a working understanding with him. Tif is recognised by His Majesty's Government, ^ Thus the Secretary of State for India addressing the Foreign Office on the subject on 13th August, last wrote ' * * they (the Government of India) cannot afford to make him their enemy and they propose to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position. 'It must of course be realised that Bin Saud, in return for a friendly attitude towards us, may ask for our support It will b e necessary then to make it clear to him tbat His Majesty's Government, while willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation, cannot under take to support him, but must maintain the strictest neutrality.' A few days later as the result of deliberation between His Majesfy's India and Foreign Offices, the following instructions were telegraphed to the' Govern ment of India by the Secretary of State (on 21st August) 'The Amir must be made clearly to understand, if he asks for our support against Turkey, as a quid pro quo for complying with our wishes, that while we are willing to do our best to reconcile him with Turkish Government, we are unable to support him (i^., against the Turks P. Z. 0.) and are bound to keen a strictly neutral attitude Later still, this time in connection primarily with the general suhiect of Railway enterprise within Asiatic Turkey, the Government of India in making- comment on certain aspects of the negotiations, telegraphed to the Secretary of State on Sth September, as follows:— ' * • * There can be no doubt from the point of view of Indian in terests, that a strong and reformed Turkey in Asia will act as a safeguard to India from interference on the part of Foreign Powers from the west, and might even in an indirect manner result in the maintenance of Persian integrity. Now that His Majesty's Government have come to terms with the Turkish Government, as regards their respective interests in the Persian Gulf, they have nothing to fear from Turks and every advantage to gain from friendly relations with the Porte. * * * * The Government of India are there fore strongly of opinion that His Majesty's Government should spare no effort to avoid any measure likely to contribute to the partition of Asiatic Turkey either at the present time or hereafter and that His Majesty's Government shoiud pursue a consistent policy of reforming strengthening and maintaining the Turkish Empire The above extracts indicate the policy of Government sufficiently clearly. As regards Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud and the imminent meeting. It is apparent from the correspondence with him that on his part he is anxi ous to establish relations with us, but seeks a more definite exposition of our attitude in regard to his relations with the Turks than mere expressions of good-will and the declaration of neutrality. It has been suggessted to him that he should explain more fully in what way he would expect us to evince our good-will and in response to this he has replied that he would like to have a meeting with a JBritish representative and discuss the position with him in person. It seems therefore to rest with Bin Saud to open the discussion by stating frankly in what direction it is that he desires the expression of our good-will or our co-operation. On our side we have explained to the Porte that now that Bin Saud has come down to the shores of the Gulf and controls certain Gulf Port9 3 he must be regarded by us as having entered the sphere of Gulf politics and we cannot ignore him but must find a modus wivendi with him for the protection of our own interests, while at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral altitude in legard to the estrangement prevailing between Bin Saud and the Porte. It. wou.d also appear that we have expressed our willingness to promote a reconciliation it desired to do so.Hakki Pasha to whom the communication was made appeared to be grati- lied railier than offended by it, and later on, apparently at the beginning of Enclosure to Foreign Departmeut Endowment 0ctober thanking His Majesty's GoV- No. 26a7-e. a., dated 13th November 1913. ernment for their friendly offer, he stated . that the Porte was actually in negotiation with Bin Saud and would not fail to avail itself of their help if necessity arose. it may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our mediation if possible—meanwhile the meeting between Bin Saud and a British representative will be taking place. It is probable that in course of discussion Bin Saud, referring to Resident's letter No. 338 of 11th September and to our desire that he should refrain from interfering in the territory or politics of other Arab Principalities on the Coast, and co operate with us for the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, will revert to his previous suggestion and enquire whether, if he gives us satisfactory undertakings under these heads, we shall be prepared to guarantee him immu nity from attack by sea. Our recent warning to the Porte that they would not be allowed to use Bahrain as a base for attacking Bin Saud, amounts indirectly and practically to a partial substitute for such a guarantee, and if Bin Saud makes a bargain with the Turks by which he is confirmed or left in his present position and if we can also reach an understanding witn him, with the cognizance of the Porte, providing for ; (i) Non-interference in territory or politics of other Arab Principalities in the Gulf including Katar. (ii) Co-operation for preservation of Maritime Truce and suppression of piracy. (iii) Co-oparation for suppression of the illicit arms traffic. (iv) Admission of British Indian traders to Katif as of old, and accept ance if necesMary of a Residency Agent to look after them, it is possible that His Majesty's Government might See their way, especi ally in view of the fact that Bin Saud's co-operation in suppression of arms traffic prevents his arming himself, and of the practical impossibility of the Turks patting troops into Katif without using Bahrain to obtain an undertak ing from them not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Saud's control without a previous exchange of views with us,the result of which would probably be that we should be able to compose the quarrel. Lastly, it is possible that the question of Katar and the status of Bin Thani may come up in course of the discussion. In this connection I think it will be well if the text of a portion of the article of the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion relating to Katar is translated to Bin Saud :— ' The Imperial Ottoman Government having renounced all claims concern ing the Peninsula of El Katar, it is agreed between the two Governments that the said Peninsula shall, as in the past be governed by Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his successors. His Britannic Majesty's Government declares that it will not permit the Shaikh of Bahrain to interfere in the internal affairs of El Katar nor to encroach upon the autonomy of the country nor to annex it'. It might be added that as the result of this agreement the present Turkish garrison will be withdrawn in due course. Dated 22nd November 1913 (=22nd Ziihijjeh 1881).

Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Sahah appears to believe that they are well founded. 2. It is said that the Porte is prepared to recognise ' Bin Saud as ruler of Nejd and Hassa, to give him a formal appointment to that post, and to allow him to collect the revenue, paying to the Porte a fixed sum per annum for the privilege, but it is understood that two of the primary conditions which they hope to make good as part of the above arrangement are:— (1) that ' Bin Saud ' should admit Turkish troops to the coast towns of Ojair, Katif as before; / (2) that he should, bind himself absolutely to refer all matters of foreign politics to be dealt with by the Porte and to allow no foreign merchants nor agents in his territory as now recognised.

Bin Saud stated, and Captain Shakespear confirmed the statement from personal experience, that modern small bore magazine rifles are useless to Arabs m the desert, as the sand speedily makes the mechanism useless. There is also • the objection of the impossibility of re-charging the cartridges for such weapons For these reasons Bin Saud requires Martinis for his men, and for the same reasons the considerable number of magazine rifles recently captured from the Turks are practically useless to him. 5. I may add that Bin Saud gave me most explicit assurances that the arma were required solely for the use of his armed forces, and were not in any wav tor trade purposes and would not be sold. 6. If the pass cannot be granted now, I venture to suggest that it might be givan when the negotiations between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government are completed, or are in a fair way to settlement. C614FD 1 M-2 No. 24, dated Buslure, the 4tli (received the 12th) January 1914. From— J. G. L obimeb , Esq., C .I .E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, rp 0 ijjjg Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. In continuation of my predecessor's letter No. 4005-M. of 2nd December 1913, I have the honour to submit a Report by No. T.-805, dated the 20th December 1913. Major Trevor, Political Agent, Bahrain. 2. In forwarding this report to the Government of India, I would remark that our position between Bin Saud and the 1 orte is somewhat G-ifhcult. On ihe one hand we have recognised as belonging to Turkey the province of Hasa, which Bin Saud at present governs as an independent ruler, and which he wishes to retain. On the other hand, it would be imprudent to shape our action on the assumption that Bin Sand's retention of Hasa will be permanent or indeed more than tempo rary. At the same time it is impossible, rfegard being had to the local interests of British subjects and proteges, that we should continue to treat Hasa as a region politically derelict and having no administrative head with whom we can deal in matters affecting British subjects. 3. Every free bargain has two sides and must contain, if it is to be accepted, some element of advantage to bo.th parties. _ With due regard to this principle a mutual arrangement seems not impossible, in regard to certain points, between ourselves and Bin Saud ; but in respect of the practicability of an accommodation between Bin Saud and the Turks, and the outlook is less promising. 4. Bin Saud is willing that British subjects should reside and do business in Hasa. He would protect them and would, in practice at least, recognise our right to represent their interests. It appears to me that, if our subjects who are desirous of trading in Hasa take advantage of his present disposition, a valuable point will have been gained by us, and that Bin Saud will himself benefit, and will be conscious of benefiting, by the mere fact that subjects of cure whom we trust him to protect reside in his territory. He cannot but be aware that he lays us under an obligation by encouraging them and that we on our part will seek every means of maintaining a situation more favourable to our people than that which existed under the Turkish regime. British subjects who are desirous of proceeding to Hasa are now being permitted to do so, and 1 am authorising the Political Agent in Bahrain to enter into such correspondence with Bin Saud as their concerns may hereafter necessitate. In this way, perhaps, one part of the Bin Saud problem will be solved without further discussion, and in a manner making it difficult for the Turks, should they subsequently reoccupy Hasa, to resume their former attitude to British subjects there. To consolidate the position, 1 I recommend that a Native Agent be at once posted to Katif to act as medium of communication between the Political Agent in Bahrain and Bin Saud's local governors. The Turks could hardly obtain the removal of this agent if, on recover ing Hasa, they found him holding an established position in the province. 5. Other matters which, it seems to me, might be settled directly with Bin Saud at the present time are that of his relations with the Shaikhs of Katar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settle under their protection. These questions arise from Bin Saud's own position as an Arab Chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Bin Saud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Shaikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to induce them to restrain or expel refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence was shown to be injurious to Bin Saud's legitimate interests. A reciprocal arrangement of this nature should now, I venture to thimc, be proposed to Bin Saud through the Political Agent in Bahrain. 6. The crux of the present negotiations is Bin Saud's virtual request that we should intervene between him and the Turks in order to secure to him the govern ment of the province of Hasa on an assured, autonomous, and probably hereditary basis. Here it seems to me that, the views of the Porte and of Bin Saud being at bottom irreconcileable, there is small prospect of our interposing with success, and that we should, therefore, in the interests of good relations both between our selves and him and between ourselves and the Turks, not be too forward in our inter position. Bin Saud is, from the Turkish point of view, a very recent and oni}momentarily successful rebel, and nothing can be offered to the Turks on behalf of Bin Saud, so far as I can see, which would appear in their eyes at the present moment an advantage worth purchasing by the concession to him of a single point. There can be no doubt that the Turks hope and expect to drive Bin Saud out of Hasa by force of arms ; if not now, then in the course of a few years. The best line of action for them is undoubtedly to maintain their claim to Hasa as a province of the Ottoman Empire and to postpone attempting to enforce it until they feel them selves stronger,—a line which they will in all probability follow. As time passes, however, if Bin Saud remains in adverse possession of Hasa, the Porte may become disposed to negotiate with him, possibly with our assistance. Three-cornered negotiations may then perhaps take place with some hope of a settlement accept able to both parties being reached, but at present circumstances are not propitious. 7. In short the most expedient course for His Majesty's Government is, I venture to think, to take in hand at once, as indicated above, the questions which seem capable of direct settlement between their Political representatives and Bin Saud, at the same time informing Bin Saud that his position in Hasa is a question in which they can only mediate between him and the Turks with the consent of both parties, but that they will do their best to support him in this manner. In fulfilment of this promise if authorised an effort might now be made to obtain, in the words of Sir Percy Cox's memorandum enclosed in his letter No. 4005-M., dated 2nd December, 1913' an undertaking from them (i.e., the Turks) not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Saud's control without a previous exchange of views with us.' In making these recommendations, I do not lose sight of the fact that Bin Saud, if left to himself, may conclude with the Turks some arrangement unfavourable to British interests in Hasa ; but, should he do so, it will be open to His Majesty's Government to take such action as is required for vindicating the in terests threatened. No. T.-805, dated Bahrain, the 20th December 1913. From— M ajor A. P. T revor , C .I .E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to Sir Percy Cox's letter No. 3669, dated the 2nd December 1913, instructing me to proceed to Ojair in company with Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Kuwait, as soon as Bin Saud arrives on the coast, and to interview him there ; in reply I beg to submit the following report of our proceedings. 2. As already reported in my diary I had heard (through Shaikh Isa) that Bin Saud would arrive at Hasa about the middle of Moharram, so that when Captain Shakespear arrived on the 7th December, having been kindly given a passage on the flagship by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I knew that there would be some little delay. 3 On the 12th December a special messenger from Bin Saud arrived with letters for Captain Shakespear and myself, explaining his delay in reaching the coast and saving that he would be at Ojair on Monday, the 16th Moharram (15th December 1913). I at once replied by the same messenger stating that Captain Shakespear and myself were ready waiting in Bahrain and that we would start for Ojair on the morning of Sunday, the 12th December (15th Moharram) and if the weather was favourable would reach there on the same night. 4. Having obtained a ' boom ' through Abdullah al-Gasebi, Bin Saud's agent at Bahrain, I accordingly left Bahrain on the morning of the 14th December, but, owing to being becalmed for several hours en Toute, we only arrived outside he reef off Oiair about midnight. The next morning (Monday, the 15th December) when making our way into the port a little before sunrise we saw Bm Sauds camp being pitched on the sand-hills about a mile east of the Custom-House and Serai (the only buildings or habitations of any description at Ojair), an ga ered that Bin Saud had already arrived. I landed with Captain Shakespear at about 8 a.m., and we were received by Bin Saud with great politeness on the shore outside the\ o Serai. After a short interview in the Serai Bin Sa ad called for horses and to the camp with him accompanied by a large crowd of horsemen, who on tv T0 ^ e gave us an ' ardtha ' or welcoming ceremony, which consists in galloping fn ^ to and fro in front of honoured guests, shouting, brandishing swords^ fv'' y rifles, etc. ~ ' n S off 5. Bin Saud told us that he had arrived about half-an-hour before we did was exceedingly cordial and friendly. The friendly personal relations existiji h tween him and Captain Shakespear, resulting from their meetings at Kuwait a^rl the desert, put us on good terms at once, and made our subsequent interv' ^ easy. On arrival at the camp we found that Bin Saud had caused a very large w to be pitched for us, and done all he could in other ways to make us comfort Kl inter alia by getting one of the best cooks in Bahrain over and entertaini e ' sumptuously in Arab style during the whole of our two days' stay. ^ de 6. On the day of our arrival and the greater part of the next day, Tuesday (16th December), we discussed with him the points mentioned in the memorandum attached to Sir Percy Cox's letter under reply. The result of these discussions is set forth in Memorandum I attached to this letter. After we had discussed the ' points Bin Saud raised the question of the policy of the British Government in Katar and Trucial Oman with special reference to their attitude in regard to enemies of lug who might take sanctuary in these states and then use them as a base for intriguing against him, or as a retreat after inciting some Bedouin tribe to revolt against him He said that of course he had not the slightest objections to fugitives f rom y' wrath taking refuge with the neighbouring Shaikhs in accordance with the usual Arab custom, provided that they did not use their sanctuary as a base for intrigue • but if they did so he would be compelled to take steps for his own safety. The gist of this conversation is recorded in Memorandum II attached to this letter. 7. After business had been concluded at the final interview Bin Saud volun teered to show us in confidence the conditions which had been proposed bv the Turkish Government and himself as a basis for settlement of his future position. Ljie document he produced and read out to us was in the form of a draft agreement containing 11 articles, five of which had been suggested by Bin Saud himself and the other six by the Turkish Government. The terms proposed by Bin Saud in sisted on complete autonomy for the region actually controlled by him, special reference being made to his right to the coast-line and to the appointment and control of all local officials. The terms proposed by the Turkish Government ^aid down a partial autonomy for Bin Saud under the suzerainty of the Sultan with the following conditions :— (1) Ihe re-instatement of the former Turkish garrisons in the Hasa pro vince. ■■ r (2) Kazis and other judicial ofiicers to be appointed bv direct ' firman ' by the Sultr.n. (3) The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents of Foreign Powers. (4) All communications from Foreign Powers or their representatives to ^ be referred to the Turkish authorities for disposal. (5) xhe payment of an annual revenue of £T.3,000. (6) No concessions to be given by Bin Sand to any foreign companies foi i ail ways or motor-car services. we 0athti fJ\ p. co nditi o n (6) above some conversation took place, from which ausrices shnuM iw ' v ^1° ^ av erse to giving concessions under British good offices 1 s position be regulanzed or in some way assured through our Saud marlp 0 } t 'rl the discussions, on more than one occasion, Bin and the Tnrk&lt;3 Iri K 0 u . ou | prefer that any reconciliation between himself ment Lc^l SS be f c ?f^ dt ^ ou g h 'n&lt;ier the auspices of the British Gow in ly with that Turkish Government! permaneIlc ^ of ^ arrangement made direct shoukl 'nMm^t f iv n ,^ a , ud sent ^structions to his Deputy at Katij that he u J e cts to enter andtrade and open shops, should they arrive5 at Katif and should protect them ; and that he should communicale with the Poli tical Agent at Bahrain regarding them should any questions arise. 11. In all the formal and private discussions which took place Bin Saud was most friendly ; he seemed very much in earnest and most anxious to do whatever he could to meet the wishes of Government and to obtain their support. We repeatedly told him that the British Government could not give him any assurance that they would keep the peace, as he expressed it, on the Hrsa coast; this of course is what he wanted, but he realized that it was impossible. The tangible results of our interviews with him were that he at once agreed to accept and protect British traders in Katif (and no doubt in other places on the coast should they want to go there) and to postpone making any settlement with the Tuiks until he marches north.in the spring, i .e., for three months. Bin Saud also stated in a more ii formal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast states, and I think that Memorandum II shows that he has no desire to act con trary to the wishes of Government in these regions. Further, ! am of opinion, and Captain Shakespear shares my view, that there is not the slightest doubt that should His Majesty's Government consider it desirable to use their good offices to effect a settlement between Bin Saud and the Porte, by which he would remam ' de jure ' ruler under Turkish suzerainty of the territories cf which he is at present' de facto '' ruler. Bin Saud would be only too glad to make a formal arrange ment with the British Government on the remainder of the four points men tioned in Sir Percy Cox's memorandum, to co-opeiate in the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, and in the preservation of the Maritime Truce. In connection with the Arms Traffic question I may mention that Bin Saud has made an application to be allowed to import rifles for the use of his troops -.this is being dealt with separately in my letter No. 806 of the 20th December 1913, but it shows, I think, that Bin Saud means to work with the British Government in the matter. 12. In the course of our conversations with Bin Saud we gathered indirectly that he would probably accept autonomy under the suzerainty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan with the payment of a trifling revenue (or tribute) to Turkey if necessary, as an acknowledgment of the suzerainty. Should His Majesty's Gov- ernment see fit to try and effect a settlement between Bin Sand and the Turkish Government, it would seem desirable, I respectfully submit, to take some definite steps within the next two months, i.e., —say before the 1st March, of which at least a hint could be communicated by me to Bin Saud before he goes north in the spring in crder to save him from making some arrangement with the Turks which might be hostile to our interests. In the meanwhile if one or two British subjects who have been pressing me to allow them to go to Katif are permitted to go there, it will strengthen our position in resisting the conditions regarding the exclusion of foreigners, which the Turks particularly desire to impose upon Bm Saud. 13. In conclusion I would observe that only Bin Saud, Captain Shakespear, and myself were present at any of the interviews at which politics were discussed, and I should like to say that the exceedingly friendly and cordial attitude of Bm Saud at the meeting was due to his friendly feelings towards Captain Shakespear. The latter's knowledge of the language and ways of the Bedouin from Central Arabia was also most helpful and his presence was mainly responsible for any favourable results which may follow from the meeting. 1 .—Memorandum of interview with Bin In order to make his position clear Bin Saud began by giving an account of the history of Nejd, from his point of view, of which the following paragraph is a resume:— His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for gene rations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself was an Arab Chief whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European Powers. Bedouin tribes ace not concerned m weighing the merits of different Governments as they live as nomads, and when oppressed move off to another lo cality. When Ibn Rashid attacked the Bm Saud family, the latter eventually won6 through, in recent years he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saud) himself has been able to consoli date his authority - in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Katif. As is well-known these places originally belonged to his family and did not pass into the hands of the Turks by fair conquest, but by stratagem, by fomentinf dis cord between two members of the family, Abdulla and Baud, the sons of Faisal and by supporting one against the other. Eventually when Abdulla was successful the Turks, in return for their help, retained their garrisons in the Hasa province, and actually took over the government of it, though Abdulla was made titular governor After a time the Bedouin Arabs finding that the local Turkish Government was weak and impotent took to indiscriminate raiding, thereby causing great chaos and want of security, while the more respectable and responsible portion of the po pulation became dissatisfied with the Government because it was unable to put a stop to the reign of lawlessness. In the meanwhile he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saudi was approached by Arabs, not only of the Hasa province but also of Baghdad, Basra and other places who were equally dissatisfied, and became convinced that the whole Arab world scorned the Turkish rule. Finding that the province of Hasa, 'where our word runs,' was being oppressed and bled by the Turks, and having been asked several times by the people of the province to intervene, he eventually determined to take the bull by the horns, re-occupy the province and ask for the support of the British Government. 2. At this stage it was pointed out to him that our first object in arranging this personal interview was to find out precisely in what way he wanted the assistance of the British Government, seeing that he was aware of the friendly relations between the British and Turkish Governments and of the neutrality of the former in res pect of the differences between him and the latter. In reply Bin Sand stated that what he was concerned with was his honoUf, the honour of his house, and the pre servation of his ancestral rights. He desired to renew a,nd maintain the ancient friendship between his family and the British Government and to have his position secured. He was led to ask the British Government for assistance because he had seen how that Government had dealt with Kuwait, Bahrain arid other places and had realized that they were to be trusted. Bin Saud added that he Wishes to have nothing to do with any other Power although he has already been approached by the Turkish Government. He feels that he must make some terms with them to safe guard his position, if the British Government disappoint him. He Wants to know definitely what their expressions of goodwill really amount to, in ocder to be able to secure his own position. 3. At this point he was asked to explain himself rather more clearly. He re plied that all he wants is to be left in peace, and he sees that the British Govern ment keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf except in this small section—the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the Maritime Peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as ''defacto' ruler, he would be satisfied; if not he would have 'to trust in his own sword,' He feels convinced that the British Government could secure this result by diplomatic means if they so desired. 4. At this point it was explained to Bin Saud that we could give him no such assurance, and moreover we were convinced that the British Government, in view of their friendship with the Turkish Government, could not do so either, as any such assurance at the present time would obviously be directed against the Turks. 5. He said that the lurkish authorities had written to him proposing that he should come to terms ; the draft conditions laid down that the '' status quo ante' should practically be restored, that he should not accept any representatives nor subjects of Foreign Powers in his territory, and that he should not hold any com munication with any horeign Power except through the Turkish authorities. He said that he thought the Turks would be ready to drop all the conditions in the pro posed agreement except the questions of the conduct of foreign policy and of the admission of foreign agents and foreign subjects. These, he thought, were their principal demands, and if he conceded them, the Porte would probably agree to leave him m peace as ' de facto ruler—how would the British Government view such an agreement? 6. It was pointed out that if he 1 continues to be the ''de facto 'ruler of the Hasa coast, it would be absolutely necessary for the local British authorities to7 have direct communication with him and his local officers for the settlement of various commercial, pearling and other disputes, which constantly arise, not to mention the apprehension of fugitive offenders and absconding divers. The British Government, therefore, would in all probability have to take up the question of the prejudice to their rights and interests which the existence of any clause excluding their representatives and. subjects would entail. 7. In the discussion which followed Bin Saud said he would be glad to co-ope rate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic, and in the maintenance of the Maritime Truce, and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast, and to admit British sub jects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurance mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this, and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all impor'- tant matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated to him that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance, 8. In the course of his remarks Bin Saud pointed out that, though he claimed | the Trucial Oman and Katar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his g | power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of Government in regard to | I them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning I | Katar, and possibly Trucial Oman, after he had occupied Hasa and Katif was hisf | desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government. 9. Bin Saud pressed the urgency of making a definite reply to the Turkish pro posals at an early date, and said'that correspondence had already been going on since Ramzan last (August 1913), but that he had delayed doing so in the hope that the proposed meeting with the Resident might result in some understanding. 10. It was then suggested to him that, as we were not in a position to state the attitude of His Majesty's Government in regard to the proposals made to him by the Turkish Government, it might be still possible for him to delay a definite answer until 'His Majesty's Government have had an opportunity of considering the report of our meeting. Bin Saud pointed out that the mere fact of the meeting would draw upon him a certain amount of opprobium from the Turks and thereby prejudice the progress of the negotiations already instituted by them. We explained that this meeting was necessary in order to find a basis for a working arrangement to settle local disputes and questions arising between his officers on the coast and local British officials. In fact, we ir formed him, the necessity of such a meeting is recogr nised and so far back as the middle of September (Shawal) last His Majesty's Gov ernment had informed the Turkish Government (through Hakki Pasha) that as he (Bin Saud) had reached the shores of the Persian Gulf, the British Government would be unable to ignore him indefinitely, and for the protection of their own inter ests would be compelled to find a modusvivendi with him, while at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral attitude and dfesMng a speedy reconciliation between him and the Turks. ( |i 11. Second day. —Bin Saud reverted to the concluding portion of the previous day's discussion, and we further explained that the primary object of our visit was to ascertain bis views with the object of enabling the British Government to find a moivs vivendi with him on the lines already suggested. It was further pointed out to him that the commercial and pearling relations between Bahrain and the coast of the Hasa province were very intimate, and that British subjects who had pre viously been in Katif had several times pressed the Political Agent, Bahrain, to allow them to return, but that he had refused to agree, pending the regularisation of Bin Saud's position or a clearer idea of his probable attitude towards them. Bin Saud then said that he had no objection to British subjects coming to Katif provid ed that their claims against local people received adequate investigation before settlement, and that, subject to this proviso, he would afford them every protection. He appeared to be under the impression that British officials might perhaps uphold and press all claims of their nationals, irrespective of the correctness of such claims. We reassured him on this point, and he then said he would gladly admit and pro tect British traders. 12. Bin Saud then reverted to the question of replying to the overtures of the Turkish Government. He said that he realised that the entire exclusion of foreign enterprise and commerce from the Hasa coast was impossible at the present time,8 in fact it has already existed for years. Accordingly he proposed to reply to the Turkish overtures that the questions between him and the Turkish Government ap peared to him to be matters which could be better discussed at a personal interview that he would be moving to the northern end of his territory in the spring after two or three months, and that he suggested that the Wali should meet him then some^ wherein the neighbourhood of Basra. He would add (and would also inforrri his agents in Basra and Baghdad) that his recent meeting with British officers at Ojair had its raison d'etre in the necessity for making some arrangement to faci litate communication between his officials on the coast and the neighbouring Bri tish officials in regard to the settlement of commercial and pearling claims and cases arising between British subjects (and proteges) and the local people ; the apprehension of fugitive offenders; and the co-operation of his local officials in cases of piracy. i 13. As Bin Saud was frank enough to tell us the lines of his proposed reply, we ventured to say that its terms seemed to us unobjectionable and asked him whether he had any objection to our communicating its general tenour in our report ; to this he replied that he had no objection, but that he hoped that the British Govern ment would see therein an earnest of his sincere desire to arrive at a with them, and would exercise their benevolent good offices on his behalf. A. P. TEEVOR, W. H. I SHAKESPEAR, Note. —In order to prevent any misapprehension the note of our interviews from which this memorandum has been compiled were translated to Bin Saud, and he agreed that they were an accurate resume of our discussions. CONFIDENTIAL. II.— Memorandum of questions raised hy Bi Trucial After the discussion on the subject of arranging a with Bin Saud had been finished, he said that he had another matter to discuss with us. He then asked us what was the policy of the British Government in regard to Katar and the Trucial Oman states. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters; in the case of the Tru cial Chiefs we had certain agreements of long-standing regarding the Maritime Truce, the Slake Trade and Arms Traffic to which we held the Shaikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Katar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo-Turkish Convention, and said that we presumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference. Bin Saud said that there was a possibility that enemies of his might take re fuge in some of these states and plot against him and foment trouble—he instanced the case of his relatives, the Araif, who are now in Katar—and asked what the c./., Bahrain and Kuwait Diaries, 1912-13. attitude of the Government would be in re gard to such cases. We said that we were unable to state definitely but would be glad to refer the matter to higher authority with a view to getting the point settled as soon as possible. He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people it might be necessary for him to take reprisals and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. 18th December 1913.

It was reported here that this vessel was also bringing ammunition for the Turkish Government. The agent of the vessel, Mr. Konoff, informs me that the ts Saratoff 'is not coming to Basrah. The Ambassador also says that General Sulaiman Pasha, former Governor of Assir, is about to leave for Basrah, and that a certain Sami Boy has been appointed Mutessarif of Nejd.

The telegram is not quite clear as to whether it is intended to repeat to Bin Saud the intimation given to the Turkish Government regarding Bahrain. I laid stress on this point when I interviewed Bin Saud in December lasb, but as I re ported at the time, it did not make much impression on him. In fact, from his point of view I do not think it amounts to much, having regard to the frequent visits of the 'Marmaris ' to Qatar and the ease with which a flotilla of native boats could be conveyed direct from Basrah in the fair season.

In contiuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 314, dated the 21st March 1914, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of a letter which I have received to-day by special messenger from Bin Sa'ud from which it will be seen that he expects to meet a Turkish Envoy somewhere round about Kuwait at an early date. His messenger is coming to discuss the matter with me to-morrow, but I shall not be able to give him any information which will be acceptable to Bin Sa'ud. In fact it looks probable that unless something definite can be communicated to him very soon. Bin Sa'ud will make his own arrangements with the Turkish Government, and such arrangements may very likely be hostile to our interests. As the mail steamer has been delayed till to-morrow by a shamal, I hope to catch her with this letter which is written in haste, and the translation of Bin Sa'ud's letter has also been done somewhat hastily. Should you have any news to communicate to Bin Sa'ud after next mail for Bahrain leaves it would probably be easier to communicate with him through Kuwait. Translation of a letter, dated the 6th Jamadi 'Abdul 'Aziz bin'Abdur Rahman al Najd, to Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter No. 512 of 1914 and to say that I have understood what you mentioned there, specially you inform me that instructions have reached you to let me know that the British Government is making efforts so as to make arrangements with the Turkish Govern ment and the discussions are progressing, it is, therefore, not advisable that I should take independent action in the matter. I beg to say that I am obliged for that and it is the very object of mine and that I would not change from what I spoke to you verbally. Inshallah presently I expect continuous negotiations from the British Government about what may please the heart. I have further to inform you that on 11th of the current month I will reach to the desection of Jubail and this time I recceiyed information from the Turkish plenipotentiary who has come from Constantinople directly and his name is Binbashi Saiyid 'Omar Fauzi Beg Mardim, formerly Vah at Basrah now Vah of Suria. He has with him some message and letters and intends to settle between myself and themselves. He has arrived at Basrah and apparently will come to Kuwait or might have come already. He is bound to see me and I will m him very soon at the direetion of Kuwait if Ged deerees so. I did not hke to see hto till I had informed you, so that you may let me know what is required and in\ v L/ - 97 what form it should be. You know of course that I adhere to my word and am firm on the matter that may near me towards the fremdship of the British Government and may check my nearing the Turks except in case I connot help, then I will tread a way good for myself Now ^ Inshallah you may let me know whatever is necessary, though your first word i had taken by the eye of accept ance, but you know that a man of business desires to know the reality and to settle his case and intention is known to you. I request you to let me know through my protege Yusuf whom I have trusted in order to negotiate with your honour so that I may (be able to ) look after my interests. May you be preserved and salaam.

In continuation of my letter No. 383, dated the 6th April 1914 (which did not after all catch the last mail steamer before she left and will reach you with this letter), I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of my reply to Bin Sa'ud's lettter. Bin Sa'ud sent a confidential messenger with this letter who had an interview with me. He said that Bin Sa'ud would like to have another meeting with me, and asked if I could arrange it. I replied that I should like very much to see Bin Sa'ud again, but I did not think it would be advisable for me to go and meet him now, without sanction from superior authority, as possibly, in view of the pour parlers going on in London, such action might be open to objection. In any case I could not add anything to what I had said at the former inter view and in my letter No. 514 as I knew nothing further. The messenger said that Bin Sa'ud had received a letter from Shaikh Mubarak suggesting a meeting with Binbashi Saiyid 'Omar Beg at Kuwait. I said that, as far as I was aware, there did not appear to be any immediate neces sity to arrive at a settlement, and recommended delay. The messenger, however, seemed to think that Bin Sa'ud would feel called upon to go if he received another letter. My impression is that Bin Sa'ud intends to go and have a meeting in any case, and is naturally very anxious to know first whether the British Govern ment has been able to do anything for him. I beg to enquire whether I should comply with Bin Sa'ud's wishes and meet him somewhere on the coast. If so, provided I receive permission at an early date, I could, no doubt, make the trip either in the R. I. M. S. ' Palinurus ' or on the S. L.'' Bahrain '. If it is not possible to communicate with me soon I do not suppose the meeting will be possible as I think Bin Sa'ud will soon go on towards Kuwait. If so, no doubt he will have an interview with the Political Agent there. I am attempting to send you the gist of this letter by telegram from Henjam, but the mail is late and possibly you will not get it much sooner. Translation of a letter No. 614, from the P 'Aziz bin'Ahdur Rahman bin 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated 6th Jamadi 1,1332—(2nd April 1914) and in reply I have to say that am afraid I have no further information which I can give you, as I have heard nothing further since my letter No. 514 was written. lour letter under reply has unfortunately just missed the mail to Bushire, but 1 will communicate with the Resident at the first opportunity. Should I receive any further news I will communicate with you. In the meanwhile there does not seem to me to be any very pressing hurry, and I would advise you to wait. if you are going up towards Kuwait, I beg to suggest that you might communi cate with the Political Agent there before actually having the meeting. I have had a talk over the whole subject with your messenger Yusuf. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 73 D.—30-4-14—36——B. A. %Ri Telegram, p. From Mr. P.E. Crow, H.M's Consul, Basrah.

My telograns SO and 21 of March 23rd and 24t to Embassy were repeated to you and I have no more information at present but will of course keep you informed of all devel opments. I do not at present see signs of r&gt;rer&gt;aration for an ex pedition to Hasa, The troops at Basrah, Including the 796 (of whom 17 were officers) who came in the Saratow, number under 1200. About 150 of these are in hosnital. The ar tillery consists of 4 PompCHBB, 2 machine guns, 2 field pieces and a mule battery of 4 guns. These are regularly exercised on the desert but no guns fired to my knowledge. The troops are also exercised and drilled daily. Orders were received in February to send a force to Ha^sa but no stern* taken to carry them out. The matter was left over till the new Wali arrived and since I have seen no indications of movement. Officers formerly stationed here have been removed or pensioned and many of the officers of the Hasa garrison have been sent to Baghdad to be court martialled. I asked Erskine on March 20th to keep me in formed of any troops despatched here from Baghdad but he has reported no movement. It waa rumoured here that more were coming, 'rskine writes to say there is nothing in it. He does not think there are 1200 in Baghdad all told. If a force goes to Kasa it will have to be a large one, a/st a ongade at least I suppose. They will not talc© on the J • with the 1200 men here, many of whom would not be available.

The subject being a complicated one it has seemed more convenient to draw up an Informal memorandum for the per sonal information and use of His Highness Hakki Pasha. In August last it was explained to His Highness that Bin Sa'ud, by the fact of his assumption of control at Qatif and 1 Oqair and the coast-line of the Hasa province, had now entered specifically into the sphere of Gulf politics and commerce; and that important British interests ard obliga tions in the Gulf (e.g. in connection with the maintenance of the maritime peace, the suppression of piracy, and the arms traffic; the settlement of pearling and slavery dis putes) made it impossible for us to ignore Bin Sa'ud and pretend to treat the province and coast of Hasa as politi cally derelict. We must necessarily have relations with some one in de facto authority, and the Turks having evacuated the region we must deal with Bin Sa^d and were glad to explain the position to them. The above communication was an obviously frank and friend ly act prompted by our desire to act with them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. HakkJ Pasha received the communication very favourably and received that the Porte was already in negotiation with Bin Sa'ud and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage of. In spite of this friendly response by His Highness we know1$ -j- from reliable local information that just after this ex^han^e Oi. coiomionications, or conceivably Just before it, 31toman (jovernmerij' were endeavouring to arrange terms atn Bin Sa'ud, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests. Thus, according our information, the followixig are the conditions which the Porte are endeavouring to impose on Bin Sa»ud as the price of his partial autonomy;— »• Phe readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hasa as formerly. o. The appointment of Qazis and other judicial officers by direct 'farmans' issued by the Sultan. 6s The payment by Bin Sa'ud of annual revenue of £ T 3,000. 4. The reference of all commuhications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6. An undertaking from Bin Sa'ud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car#3ervices. Incidentally, the Minister of the Interior has since in formed His Majesty's Ambassador (1st December 1913) that the Ottoman Government had decided to recognise the recent fait accompli in Najd (Hasa) by nominating Bin Sa'xad as Mutessarif of that district. The first three of the skix conditions above quoted refer to matters with which we are not immediately concerned, but considering th^t^ank communication made to Hakki Pasha in August by His Majesty's Foreign Office, it would not be unnatural that His Majesty's Government should be greatly surprised at the terns of the latter three, especially 4 and 5 and, if the information proved to be correct, should feel constrained to protest strongly against them. The only explanation of such coudi tions would appear to bet i tha„ the Porte mistrust the assurances already offered d&gt;f cur rsadlness to oo-operate, and that they fail to ap preciate the difficulties in which xve are placed by the continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs between themselres and Bin Sa'dd. We fully recognise that Najd is an Ottoman province, and have no desire to interfere in it, but for the reasons already given we cannot ignore Bin Sa'ud now that he is in occupation of the coast-line. There is no secret regarding oar requirements. What we require of him, for the maintenance and protection of our interests is:- 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Qatar. 8. That like other Shaikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf he should co -operate for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce i .e. the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter -tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. 4. That British traders should be freely admitted to Qatif, and properly treated while there. There is nothing in these conditions to which either Bin Sa'ud or the Porte can take the least legitimate objection; at the same time it is only natural that while expressing his readiness to accept the obligations involved. Bin Sa'ud should in turn desire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish authorities, and should ask us to deter Shaikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. We had no wish to intrude ourselves, but the terms of the conditions which, as we hear, the Porte now seek to impose on Bin Sa'ud, show so little friendliness toward ourselves, anri are1^0 are so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to' return to the subject. ■?e are primarily ooncerned to see the last three oondi- ;ions withdrawn, but we should also be glad to see a satis factory arrangement come to v .-ith Bin Sa'ud by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin ^a'ud as ex-officio 'utessarif of Hasa, they should approve and take cognizance of his undertaking to comply locally wi ui^ufc four desiderata above detailed, and, while reserving the right to take in the last resort whatever action they may deem necessary, should, by way of friendly co-opera tion with the British Government for the preservation of peace and good order in the Gulf, agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the Hasa coast, without first oonaulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible.

I am not inclined to share the views expressed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, in the last portion of his letter regarding the advisability of asking the Porte to defer action pending the result of the discussion of Bin Sa'ud's position with His Excellency Hakki Pasha. The fact that such a communication was made could not well be conveyed to Bin Sa'ud, and would not therefore earn his gratitude, and, from the general trend of the correspondence, I gather that the ' independent action ' against which the Secretary of State desires Bin Sa'ud should be warned is not so much warlike preparations to repel a possible invasion as some form of entangling alliance which might injuriously affect British interests. With both sides engaged in warlike preparations, which, from recent reports, seem unlikely to lead to active operations, it may be hoped that the possibility of such an understanding between Bin Sa'ud and the Turks is a remote one and, so long as active hostilities do not result, and this eventuality is being carefully watched, it would seem, from our point of view, that both parties could not be better employed.

Enclosures 4 and 5 arrived from Basrah two days aao and they will receive replies to the effect that Sir Mubarak does not see his wly to assist either side and must decline to be drawn into the matter or to give Ty advice, as although he sympathises with the desire of both sides to avoid blood- shwior^ anything whrch woid produce enmity among Muslims he must be faithful to his longstanding fciendship with Bin Sa ud. _ tj . + w a TnrVi^h force of 1,000 men with five guns has recently been enSmpK'zobair, and that the Basrah authorities had written to Ibn Rashld caUing :forb|lshelp on t^eipt o^rHnch^they^mtend^ed jBasrahTa Sir Mubarak informed y ^ rnm ti ™ Rashid.

Referring to Foreign Department telegram No. D.S.-166 of 17th March to your address, it may perhaps be observed that Bin Sa'ud will be more likely to accept with gratitude and readiness any arrangement which we may make on his behalf with the Turks if they, as well as he, are asked to defer action pending the result of the negotiations. Captain Shakespear, who was at Eiadh on the 10th ultimo, informs me that Bin Sa'ud had then already heard of the Turkish attempts at mobilisation, and it will naturally be more difficult to restrain him unless such preparations on their part are suspended.

F ^ h . e r letters also arrived yesterday from the Wali of Basrah and Saiyid Tahb in which Sir Mubarak was informed that the Ottoman Government had signihed their intention of conferring upon him and upon Sir Khazal Khan of Muhammerah the decoration of the Osmanieh in the first class, and the Wali expressed a wish to come to Kuwait for the purpose of investing Sir Mubarak with the insignia thereof. His Excellency asked me what I thought of this I replied that as he_ had already expressed to the Turks his regret at not being able to act as an intermediary in their negotiations with Bin Sa'ud he need feel no awkwardness in accepting this mark of favour at their hands. He remarked that the presence of the Wali of Basrah in Kuwait at the present moment would be likely to lead to misunderstandings, as his object would certainly be to use this place as a base from whence to carry on negotiations with Bin Sa'ud and asked whether it would not be better for him to borrow my launch—his own beino- hors de combat at present—and proceed to Fao for the investiture, explaining to the Wali that this course would save him trouble and the inconvenience of prolonging his journey. I can see nothing objectionable in this proposal from the local point of view, but it appears better that I should ask yoa to telegraph to the Government of India asking whether for any reason it would be well to allow the Wali to come to Kuwait, and if you see no objection I hope you will do this and ask for a reply at their earliest convenience. 4. I append a translation of a letter recently written by Bin Sa'ud to Saiyid Talib from which it will be seen that he has no intention at present of entering into any agreement with the Turks. He is now some distance north of Eiyadh, but his advance is not intended as a hostile demonstration. 5. In letter No. 39902-13, dated 2nd October last, from His Majesty's Foreign Office to India Office, it is stated that Hakki Pasha, in thanking His Majesty's Government on behalf of the Porte for their friendly offer of good offices in the6 difficulty with Bin Sa'ud, adds that if the necessity arises the Porte will not fail to avail itself of them. Sir P. Cox, in his ' memorandum of guidance for Maior Trevor at his meeting with Bin Sa'ud m December last, observes that &lt;£ it may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our media tion if possible and the local state of affairs at the moment leads me to fear that, notwithstanding Hakki Pasha's apparent readiness frankly to exchange views at the discussions which have recently taken place m London, the replies of the Porte to the representations of His Majesty s Government may be purposelv delayed pending the result of the efforts which are being made locally to effect a settlement with Bin Sa'ud, a settlement which., whatever its exact terms may be, will certainly be opposed to our interests, and fatal to the future peace and prosperity of certain regions adjoining the Persian Gulf. Translation of a letter from Abd-ul-Aziz Talib undated. After compliments, I was very pleased to receive your letter signifying your devotion to the Exalted Government (Porte), which devotion 1 share, as you know, brother, that I am the first in wishing well to that Government and country. And it is with great grief that I have to ask you to represent to the persons charged with the business that although I do not waver in allegiance to Islam or turn from obedience to the Porte there are things that I cannot do. Please present my good wishes to Anwar Pasha, the present war minister, and assure him that I also aesire the union of Islam and the binding together of separated hearts, and moreover that I am grate ful to him for having sent His Excellency Saiyid 'Umar Fauzi Beg for the establish ment of friendly relations and for the latter having brought a valuable present in the shape of the noble Koran. But it is not hidden from you that the affairs of our country at the present moment are in a very strange condition, of which indeed the description is impossible, and that I am not responsible for this. If the Government's intentions are really to protect the country from various dangers and to gather Islam together in obe dience to the Khalifate then this can only be done by diplomatic measures followed . . ., by a proclamation, and it is for the Porte to •H,.

In continuation of my letter No. C.-12, dated 7th instant, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Saud and the Turkish Government. 2. The Turkish plans in regard to the negotiations have again changed. A letter, of which a translation is attached, was received on the 12th instant from Saiyid Talib. It intimates that the management of these afiairs has now been entrusted to him; that he is coming to Kuwait in company with the Binbashi Saiyid Umar Fauzi Beg and the chief of the Baghdad staff; and that they hope to meet Bin Saud when he arrives in the immediate neighbourhood. Six Mubarak has promised to inform Saiyid Talib of the arrival of Bin Saud at Subaiyah some 20 miles south of Kuwait where he is expected to be in about ten days' time ; the p^rty will then come to Kuwait, and if Bin Saud is still in the neighbourhood when they arrive the meeting may take place, but it is doubtful whether Bin Saud will consent to an interview as he is said to be determined to give no reply other than that contained in his letter to Saiyid Talib, the enclosure to my letter No. C.-12, dated 7th instant. 3. Possibly the position of affairs may change when and if the deputation have found that a personal discussion fails to modify the attitude of Bin Saud in regard to the negotiations, but it would apparently be advisable to press the Turkish Government for an early reply to the Foreign Office memorandum of Mn-ch 9th last, and, if possible, to induce them to abstain from further attempts to arrange matters without our assistance pending the consideration of such reply by His Majesty's Government. , S ub -E nclosure.

Mubarak should be informed at the same time that we do not object to his good offices being afforded to assist the negotiations. The four British desiderata,which are set forth in the memorandum of March 9th to Hakki Pasha, should also be brought to his notice: i.e. (1) That Bin Sa'ud should not interfere in the territory and politics of Arab rulers on the Gulf,including Qatar.

In continuation of my letter No. C-15, dated the 22nd instant, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Sa'ud and the Turkish Government 2 ' T3 ur ^| s h representatives did not come to Kuwait last week as had been arranged. By the mail of the 22nd instant Shaikh Sir Mubarak received a letter from Saiyid lalib stating that he had written to Constantinople for more precise instructions in regard to the terms which he was to make with Bin Sa'ud, and that he had heard m reply that the question was still under discussion but that instructions would be furnished to him. The party has arrived this morning in Sii Mubarak's steam launch ' Mishrif ' which has been for the last month or so Iving at Mohammerah. 3. On the evening of the 26th instant Bin Sa'ud arrived atSubaihiyah with a large following, and early on the morning of the 27th the Shaikh sent his Secretary to inform me that he had written asking the Amir to come to Malah, which is about half way between Kuwait and Subaihiyah, for the purpose of meeting me there. During the day the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' arrived with your endorse ment forwarding for necessary action by me telegram No. 256-S. from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, ard I explained to Shaikh Sir Mubarak in the afternoon that portion of its contents which concerned himself. Late in the evening came a reply from Bin Sa'ud to the effect that he would be at Malah on the following morning and hoped that I could come out then as he was anxious for a meeting as soon as possible. I accordingly went out yesterday taking with me the telegram above referred to. 4. After the usual polite enquiries I commenced the interview, at which nobody else was present, with explaining to the Amir that portion of the telegram of the Government of India which was intended for his information. I could see that he was disappointed, and at first inclined to think that he had been allowed to foster hopes which were not to be realised, but I had no difficulty in removing this view by the explanation that it was the Turkish Government who had declined our ofler of mediation and that His Majesty's Government obviously could not force upon them assistance which they did not desire. I informed him as instructed that there was now no objection to direct negotiations taking place between him and the Turks, and that the views of His Majesty's Government had been conveyed to the Porte. 5 In replv, the Amir said that he did not intend to make an independent arrangement with the Turks unless he were forced to do so because they were never faithful to their engagements and in a very short time, it might not oe more than two months, things would be as bad as ever m Hassa, He asked me what were the views of His Majesty's Government which had been conveyed to the Porte. I replied that they concerned the provisional undertakings mto which he had entered \Jwith our officers at Bahrain. He remarked that he had no further motion regarding the conditions which the Turks would demand of him, but that they would never allow the presence of foreigners at Katif and that, in the event of an agreement being arrived at between him and themselves, they would undoubtedly compel him to keep such persons out. 6. I here thought it best to tell the Amir plainly that I had no authority to go over the old ground again, neither had I come out to persuade him to take a course contrary to his inclinations, but that my duty was merely to carry oat the instruc- tions which I had received. He then asked me whether, should iie persevere witr t e answer already given to Saiyid Talib {vide the enclosure to my letter iNo. 0.-12, dated 7th April), there would be any chance eventually of securmg the mediation of His Majesty's Government. I replied that probably in that case the Tuiks woulu ask for that mediation which they had now declined in the hope of securing an agree ment without it; but Bin Sa'ud appeared to think that they would prefer war to that and went on to question me regarding the preparedness or unpreparedness of j ur^ey for war from which I saw that he was carefully considering this alternative. ^ Before our interview closed he asked me whether His Majesty s Government would give him an assurance that the Turks would never be allowed to take hostile action by sea against the coast between Kuwait and Bahrain, as, he said, with that assurance he was prepared to defy them indefinitely, but I replied that I had no information on the subject beyond that already given to him in regard to Bahrain and its waters. 7. I Confess that I returned to Kuwait without a clear idea of what course Bin Sa'ud was likely to take, in fact I doubt whether he has himseli come as yet to a definite decision. That he would prefer to persevere in his refusal to accept any arrangement which was not guaranteed in some form or another by His Majesty s Government I am convinced, and that Shaikh Sir Mubarak and other friends have inspired him with that confidence in us which he lacks in the Turks is certain; but he seems to fear that in default of a definite promise such as that referred to above he might be left to face attacks by sea as well as by land which would be more than he could repel; and he may on this account feel obliged to make the best terms possible for himself at the approaching conference. In the latter case I regard it as in the highest degree probable that he will use every possible means to draw His Majesty's Government into the negotiations, e.g., by accepting, under the plea of compulsion, conditions from the Turks which he knows we will be loth to recognise owing to the interests assailed. 8. I hope to be able to report further within the next few days, and in view of the interesting position which now exists here am sending a copy of this letter direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to save time.vV v \ r .

TTJRKEY - [9th March.J CONFIDENTIAL. l^TT 10569 No ^ Memorandum communicated to Hakki Pasha, 9th March 1914 BIN SAUD. The subject being a complicated one it has seemed more convenient to draw up an intormal memorandum for the personal information and use of His Highness Ilakki Pasha. la August last it was explained to His Highness that Bin Saud bv the fact of his assumption of control at Katif and Ojair and the coast-line of the iiil Hassa province, had now entered specifically into the sphere of Gulf politics and commerce; and that important British interests and obligations in the Gulf {e.g., in connection with the maintenance of the maritime peace, the suppression of piracy, and the arms traffic; the settlement of pearling and slavery disputes) made it impossible for us to ignore Bin Saud and pretend to treat the province and coast of Hassa as politically derelict. We must necessarily have relations with someone in authority, and the Turks having evacuated the region we must deal with Bin Saud and' were glad to explain the position to them. The above communication was an obviously frank and friendly act prompted by our desire to act with them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. Hakki Pasha received the communication verj^ favourably, and replied that the Porte was already in negotiation with Bin Saud and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage of. In spite of this friendly response by His Highness we know from reliable local information that just after this exchange of communications, or conceivably just before it, the Ovtoman Government were endeavouring to arrange terms with Bin Saud, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests. Thus, according to our information, the following are the conditions which the Porte are endeavouring to impose on Bin Saud as the price of his partial autonomy :— 1. The re-admission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hassa, as formerly. 2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct 'farmans' issued by the Sultan. 3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of £ T. 3,000. 4. The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6. An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor car services. Incidentally, the Minister of the Interior has since informed His Majesty's Ambassador (1st December 1913) that the Ottoman -Government had decided to recognise the recent in Nejd (El Hassa) by nominating Ibn Saud as Mutessarif of that district. The first three of the six conditions above quoted refer to matters with which we are not immediately concerned, but considering the frank communication made to Hakki Pasha in August by His Majesty's Foreign Office, it would not be unnatural that His Majesty's Government should be(V V 2 greatly surprised at the terms of the latter three, especially 4 and 5, and, it the information proved to be correct, should feel constrained o procesc strongly against them. The only explanation of such conditions would appear to be that the Porte mistrust the assurances already offered of our readiness to co-opera e, and that they fail to appreciate the difficulties in which we are placed by t le continuance of the present unsatisfactory state oi affairs between themselves and Bin Saud. We fully recognise that Kejd is an Ottoman province, and have no desire to interfere in it, but for the reasons already given we cannot ignore Bin baud bow that he is in occupation of the coast-line. There is no secret regarding our requirements. What we require of him, for the maintenance and protection of our interests, is— 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or polities of Arab prin cipalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar, 2. That like other Shaikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf he should co operate for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce ; the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. 4. That British traders should be freely admitted to Katif, and properly treated while there. There is nothing in these conditions to which either Bin Saud or the Porte can take the least legitimate objection; at the same time it is only natural that while expressing his readiness to accept the obligations involved, Bin Saud should in return desire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish authorities and should ask us to deter Shaikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. We had no wish to intrude ourselves, but the terms of the conditions which, as we hear, the Porte now seek to impose on Bin Saud, show so little friendliness toward ourselves, and are so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to return to the subject. We are primarily concerned to see the last three conditions withdrawn, but we should also be glad to see a satisfactory arrangement come to with Bin Saud by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin Saud as ex officio Mutessarif of El Hassa, they should approve and take cognisance of his undertaking to comply locally with our four desiderata above detailed, and, while reserving the right to take in the last resort whatever action they may deem necessary, should, by way of friendly co-opera tion with the British Government for the preservation of* peace and good order in the Gulf, agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the El Hassa coast, without first consulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible.

Grey, the fact that information regard ng the recent meeting between British officers and Bin Sand has come to the knowledge of the Ottoman Government renders it necessary that the utmost care .should be exercised in regard to any future communications with that chief, as it is clear from the language of Hakki Pasha that such com- mumcations do in fact tend to give rise to grave suspicion on the part of the Ottoman Government. Sir E. Grey is further of opinion that, in view of the language of His Highness, the utmost caution should be observed at the interviews which are to take place with Hakki Pasha next week, in order that the Or,toman Gov ernment may be reassured as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government. Sir E. Grey believes that the Ottoman Government, if treated with frankness, will show themselves prepared to meet the reasonable requirements of His Majesty's Government, but he is anxious to dispel any erroneous impression which may have arisen that British policy is directed towards weakening the Ottoman authority in Nejd, as such a policy would be inconsistent with' that of upholding the integrity of the Ottoman Empire to which reference is made in your letter of the ISth September 1^13. I am, &amp;c., W. L anglet. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by I called on Hakki Pasha to-day with refererce to the Turco-German nego tiations, and he took the opportunity of saying to me, under instructions, that it was persistently reported at Basra that His Majesty's Government had, through their agents in the Persian Gulf, entered into direct relations with Bin Saud. This had created a very painful impression at Constantinople, for the British Government had solemnly recognised that west of the blue line attached to the Convention signed on toe 29th July 1913, and to the north of that line, excepting Kuwait, the territory was Turkish, and formed part of an Ottoman province ; the Turkish Govornment was, therefore, greatly concerned to hear that such communication hrd been made by us direct to an Ottoman subject in territory recognisied as Ottoman, and that any communication should not have been addressed to the Ottoman Government. I said that curiously enough this was the very subject about which I wished to speak to him, and t^at the appointments I had already fixed for him at the Foreign Office on Aloud ay and Wednesday were in order that he might have a full and frank interchange of views with Sir Percy Cox who was shortly going to India, and vvith Sir A. Hirtzel and myself. V\ T e felt that it would be of great value for such m exchange to take place about our mutual interests in the Gulf, and about Bin Saud in particular. / | ■The meeting to which he had referred had in fact taken place. Hakki Pasha would recollect that some months ago I had spoiven to him a on is Maiestv's Government being able to use their good offices m order to ellect a reconciliation between him and the Turkish Government, and His Hig ness had, after reference to Constantinople, expressed his Government s apprecia tion of our offer, which, if later need should arise, they would be glad to avniL themselves of, but that they were themselves in negotiation with Bin Saud and they hoped soon to reach a satisfactory settlement. Now, however, no substantial progress seemed to have been made with Bin Saud by the Ottoman Government, and meanwhile there had been great un rest on the Trucial Coast and near Maskat, there were fears that Bin Saud, if His Majesty's Government treated him with coldness, would retaliate by forc ible action against the tribes under our protection, and we could not face with equanimity the prospect of having to send a large expedition to quell any disturbances which might arise. This, and the fact that our merchants were damaged in their interests by being excluded from El Katif, made it necessary for us, from the force of circumstances, to address some communications to Bin Saud ; but we were so far from wishing to undermine the Ottoman authority, or depart from an attitude of strict neutrality to which His Majesty's Govern ment intended to adhere, that we had already arranged with Sir P. Cox to meet Hakki Pasha in order to have a full discussion. Hakki Pasha said he had no authority to discuss the position with Sir P. Cox, but he would agree to meet him provided it was understood that the discussion should be tentative and non-committal. The Ottoman Govern ment meant to re-establish their garrisons in El Hasa, and they would deeply resent it if Bin Saud received any encouragement from us. I repeated that we were and would remain neutral, but we had certain interests to protect on the Trucial Coast, and we must also insist upon our merchants having access to El Katif as to every other portion of the Ottoman Empire : we had, however, heard it stated that the Turks wished to exclude us from El Katif even for purposes of trade. Hakki Pasha said he could not think that this was really the case, but he impressed upon ms that the Ottoman Government attached great value to our formal and binding recognition of the province of Nejd, for Parliament was soon meeting and they would have to make full use of this in justifying the many concessions they had made to us, with ragard to El Katr, the Aden delimitation up to the Buba A1 Khali, and the Turco- Persian frontier; and if now they found that we did not in fact recognise Turkish authority in Nejd the agreements with us would be most unpopular: in fact, the Ottoman Government would be bound by their engagements to us, and we should evade our awn to them. I impressed upon him very clearly and repeatedly that there was no ques tion of any such evasion—a situation of fact had arisen and must be faced, and for this purpose we wished to meet him in friendly discussion. If we had not wished to deal with the matter in this open and friendly way, we should not have proposed to him in the tummer to use our good offices to effect a recon ciliation. The discussion was quite Hendly, but I feel that the situation is delicate, and that unless it is carefully handled the Turks may make difficulties. Foreign Office) 7th March 1914, A. P.

Enclosure. Extract from a letter frona F. E. Crow, Esq., C.M G., His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople, No. 28, dated the 2nd May 1914. As reported in my telegram 35 of 28th April last, the Commission appointed to effect a setilement of the Hasa question with Bin Saud left Basrah in the Shaikh of Kuwait's launch for Kuwait on the morning of the 28th ultimo. The Commission consisting of Saiyid Talib Bey Naqibzadah as President, Major Beha ad Din Bey, Chief of the Baghdad Staff, Major Omar Fauzi Bey, Chief of the Basrah Staff, who had previously visited Kuwait, and Sami Effendi Mutassarif of Hasa, was accompanied by Eumer Bey, a Basrah lawyer. Muhammad al Nama, Arab notable and landed proprietor, and Abdul Wahab Mandil and Abdul Latif Mandil; the latter are Arab notables and landed proprietors and represent Bin Saud at Basrah as agents. I understand that the instructions to the Commission are to settle the question in a friendly way and that they will meet Bin Saud at Kuwait. The 1st class of the Osmanieh has been conferred on Shaikh Mubarak by the Sultan and* as the decoration had not arrived at Basrah, an order was borrowed from Saivid Talib Bey, presumably the same, and sent to the Shaikh by the hands of Barhan ad Din Bey, Public Prosecutor of the Basrah Appeal Court, and Hilmi Effendi, Director of Public Instruction. These gentlemen travelled with the Commission on board the Shaikh's launch. On receipt of the decoration from Constantinople, it is to be handed to Saiyid Talib in return for the one he lent. The iudicial authorities were very loth to part with the Public Prosecutor, whose services are required in the Courts where much business awaits him. A letter addressed by the President of the Court to the Vali pointing out the inconvenience caused by the Public Prosecutor's absence from his post and the consequent delay to the business of the courts was not well received and the Vali explained that it was only fair to the Public Prosecutor to give him the chance of making a little money. Some irritation seems to have been caused in the Serai by this observation.Telegram. 'R'. ^ Prom F.B.

Sir, On the 13th September last, as you are aware, a letter was addressed to this Department hy the direction of the Secretary of state for India, enclosing a telegrara from the Viceroy, which contained the following passages &gt; 'There can he no doubt, so far as India's interests are concerned, that the existence in Asia of a strong Turkish power, friendly and reformed, will be a safeguard against interference with India from the west; it might even be the indirect means of Persia's integrity being maintained. We have nothing to fear from Turkey, now that we have reached an agreement with her in the Persian Gulf, whereas we have everything to gain by keeping our relations with her friendly. India's interests cannot, as we are fully aware, entirely govern policy of His Majesty's Government towards Turkey, but it would be a serious prospect for India if partition of Turkey eventuated. Our responsibilities would ti:Increased thereby, and Great Britain, it may be observed, would have to bear a share of the increase. •It is our strong opinion, therefore, that every effort should be made to avoid action likely to lead to the partition, either now or in the future, or Turkey's Asiatic possessions, and that His Majesty's Government should pursue consistently the policy of maintaining the Turkish Empire % while reforming and strengthening it', I am to rtquest that the despatch No.193 of March 18th from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople of which a copy was sent to you on the 30th ultimo, may be read in the light of the above statement of policy; and I am to observeat, in view of the importance of a successful settlement feeing reached of the negotiations now taking place between the Ottoman Government and Bin Baud through the Sheikh of Kowelt, Sir E, Qnty on consideration has grave doubts as 00 ^ ^'isaorn of conveying to Bin Baud a warning, as propos* ed in the telegram of March 16th to the Viceroy, against acting Independently of His Majesty^ Government. It is true that direct*® negotiations have, in a very informal manner, taken place between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Ottoman Government; but Sir S. Grey feels that this it does not, in existing conditions afford sufficient justification for an intimation being conveyed to a Turkish subject that he should not negotiate with his own Government, especially hav^ing regard to the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of so recent a date as July 29th, 1913. If, as the Government of India may apprehend, terms are agreed between the Ottoman Government and Bin 3aud which arejiij^naistent with British rights, or unfair to British commercial interests, or opposed to the political duties of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, the remedy, in Sir E. Grsy^ opinion, would lie in direct negotiation ^th the Ottoman Government, The adoption of this procedure, aai the discontinuance of direct communications of a Question able nature with Bin Saud may possibly, Sir E. Grey holds, cause some minor local inconvenience in the Persian Gulf; but such inconvenience would in probability be of short duration and it is desirable to incur it rather than to run the risk of the graver dangers so forcibly portrayed in the Viceroy^ telegram of last September, 1 am, etc., Sd/- Eyre A.

In continuation of my letter No. C.—16, dated 29th April I thw ^onour to report further on the subject o f Bin Saud and the Turkish Govern- 2. As stated in my last letter, the Turkish deputation headed by Saiyid Enclosure No. 2. Talil), son of tu© J^iakib ot Basrah and. ^T ait m1116 29Auml'n Sha 'kh ak's'lamch Mishnf winch had been placed at their disposal. The same day the Order of he Osmameh was presented to Shaikh Sir Mubarak witbout cei-emony and J f o?, P. 1 ;? 0 ' 06 0 , f a few P ersons onJ y. During the mornin- of the 30th the Shaikh sent for my Agency Mulla and asked him to let me know that the deputation were pressing him to accompany them on the occasion of their visit to Bin Saud. I replied through the Mulla that, as I had already informed him His Majesty s Government had no objection to his good offices being afforded to assist in the negotiations; and, to put his mind at rest, addressed to him the official letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report. The Shaikh replied to me the following day as given in enclosure (2). 3. During the whole of 30th April and 1st May the deputation were engaged in discussing the terms which were to be put before Bin Saud, and on the morning of the 2nd instant they proceeded to Subaihiyah whence they returned on the 4(th. 4. I called on Sir Mubarak yesterday and he informed me of what had taken place. His version^ which is confirmed generally by reports which have reached me from other sources, is probably substantially correct. The Turks first announced to Bin Saud their scheme for settlement, which was that he must first of all accept the reposting of Turkish garrisons in Katif and Ujair and their reinforcement by additional posts in Hassa: that all the forts in Ujair and Hassa must be surrendered to them ; that all cannon and small arms captured must be made over to the Turkish troops; and that he is to have no connection whatever with any foreigners or foreign Power. In return for these conditions they agreed to recognise his autonomy ; to allow him to collect all taxes, &amp;c., and to give him verbal, though not written, per mission to retake Katar and Trucial Oman when he chose. Bin fcaud's scheme was then stated to them; it was that he should retain Katif, Ujair, and Hassa under Turkish suzerainty: should pay them £T3,000 per annum as tribute money; and should be at the disposal of Turkey, with his men, in the event of armed assistance being required. The subsequent discussions turned upon the reinstatement of the Turkish garrisons: the deputation insisted upon this condition and Bin Saud refused to give way. After some time harsh words passed between him and Saiyid Umar, the latter was rash enough to say that if Bin Saud would not accept this condition he would be compelled to do so, whereupon the Amir started up and half drawing his sword ordered Saiyid Umar to leave the assembly, and any possibility of successful negotiations appears to have been at an end from tiiat moment. The Turkish deputation returned to Basrah in the Shaikh's launch on the night of the 4th instant, and are to report to Constantinople the failure of their negotiations.2 ' 5 Sir Mubarak lias from time to time mnde to me explanations of p. oir ..luDaraK ua tter ail( j summed them up dtwiog our position m f ' 0 ' 7'^ J ^ 0 t C ng been able to accept the inyitatioa ' V the negotiations, but into™, me that in anv case nothing could have induced Bm Saud to accept the condition regarding the return of Turkish troops to what he regards as his ancestral domains.

Turk 7 8h de P^l at '^^ obliged to assist Saiyid Umar Fauzi Beg to a certain extent, first because he was the representative of a foreign Power with whom his relation a are friendly, secondly, because he was his guest on the occasion of his visit to Kuwait, and thirdly, because of the friendship which exists between himself and_ Saiyid TJmar's father. He did not want the Vah of Basrah in Kuwait aa it might have been difficult to refuse to him that which he could decline to do tor Saiyid Talib, and he had felt ail along that he could not help in the negotia tions. 1 received in silence this statement, with part of which at ieast it was impossible not to feel sympathy. 6.

In continuation of my letter No. 1350, dated lOth May on the subject of the Turks and Bin Saud, I have the honour to state that the Political Agent, Kuwait, reports on the 10th May that no further news has reached him regarding Turkish projects, and that he does not expect any for some days. 2, Bin Saud has not visited Kuwait, and is at present encamped at Jahra, 21 miles out, whence he intends to set off for his own country almost immediately. The Political Agent hjas not seen him again nor has there been any correspondence between them. He further reports that in the opinion of Shaikh Sir Mubarak, the Turks will be more likely to declare war upon Bin Saud than to reopen the subject of mediation on the part of His Majesty's Government. Should the latter proposal again come to the fore, a difficulty will, the Political Agent considers, be encountered in connection with the return of Turkish garrison to Hasa. which appears to be the principal condition of settlement in the eyes of the Turks, and, at the same time, the point which Bin Saud is least inclined to concede. 3 I am not inclined to share Shaikh Mubarak's fears of war by the Turks upon Bin Saud, but I agree with the Political Agent in thinking that, should we be asked to mediate, we should find the greatest difficulty in inducing the Amir to accent tbe presence of Turkish troops at Hasa, and I would venture to suggest that we should do our utmost to dissuade the Turks from insisting on any such •proposal. Even if we succeeded m persuading the Amir to accept Turkish troops, the possibilities of future friction would be considerable.^ The payment of revenue, flying the Turkish flag over Hasa boats and the Anur s Hofuf residence or his tents while in the Sanjaq, and perhaps the presence o a Turkish Cml Adviser with a small escort of Turkish infantry for his personal protection and as a badee of rank and dignity, so to speak, would appear to be far more acceptable indications of Turkish suzerainty from the Arab point of view.Telegram. r .

Grey to invite the attention of the Secretary of State for India to the telegram from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on tne same subject, No.214 of April 2nd,^of which a copy was sent to your Office on the same day. In view of Talaat Bey's statement, as reported in that telegram, that a direct understanding between the Sublime Porte and Bin Saud is expected, it appears to Sir E. Grey essential that the intimation which it had been proposed to convey to Bin Saud, warning him against acting independently of His Majesty's Govern ment, should be held back, if not cancelled. I am, etc., Sd/- fiyre A. Crowe The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(COPY) P. 1278 Immediate India Office, Whitehall. London, 3.W 4th April. 1914, Sir I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.12320 of the 1st instant regarding the relations of Bin Saud with the Ottoman Government. The Marquess of Crewe fully appreciates the force of the considerations stated in the telegram from the Government of India which was quoted therein, but saw nothing inconsistent with them in the policy of endeavouring to effect between the de facto ruler of Nejd and the Ottoman Government an arrangement that should be consistent with the interests of ail parties. His view was that the integrity of Turkey was more likely to suffer if Bin Saud were left to negotiate uncontrolled by His Majesty^ Government, for if the negotiations took the form (as was likely) of an attempt to coerce him, they would almost certainly result in calling into being the Arab Confederacy to which Sir L. Mallet has referred. LordZlO Lo.;d Crewe was further anxious to prevent an Inconvenient situation from arising. He believed that if Bin ^aud, disappointed of our good offices, were to uhrow himself into the anas of Turkey, and to adopt a hostile attitude to British interests - whether by placing obstacles in the way of trade or by intriguing nit; with, or even attacking the Trucial Chiefs - the in convenience that would result could not be localised in the Persian Gulf, but would certainly lead to serious friction with the Ottoman Government itself. And, judging from the past, he felt sure that it would not be of short duration. In fact, the same reasons that have led to the conclusion of a convention with Turkey safeguarding British interests in those regions appeared to him to indicate that His Majesty's Govern ment should by some means be a party to the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and Bin Saud, though the position of the latter as a rebel might make formal British participation impossible; and these were. His Lordship understood, the reasons for the opening ox informal discussions with Hakki pasha. When once those discussions had begun it seemed to Lord Crewe dangerous if Bin Saud were to negotiate independently .Independently with local Turn ah authorUlee who might not be cognisant or what was taking place In London, and he therefore sent his telegram of the 16th March. Since that date, however, the discussions with liakkl pasha lave made no progress, and It appears that the Ottoman Government are approaching Bin Saud through the Snelkhs of Kowelt and Mohammera, both of whom are sensible men, friendly to British Interests. His Lord ship is therefore disposed, with sir E. Grey's concurrencs to Instruct the Government of India that. If this is true, there Is no objection to Bin Saud negotiating on his own account, and that HIb Majesty's Government have made the Ottoman Government aware of the nature of the settlement that they favour. But Load Crewe would prefer that the Sheikh should not be encouraged actually to conclude a settlement until His Majesty's Government have satisfied themselves - whether tnrough him or through the Ottoman Government - that its terms do not conflict with their interests. In the meantime His Lordship is of opinion that if the Turkish authorities at Basra make any prepara tions for the actual despatch of troops, one of His Majesty's ships should be sent to ensure that the territorialterritorial waters of tiie Bahrein islands are not entered. He regards the reef of Pasht al Yarim. to the HBEfeMss north-west of Bahrein harbour, as forming part of the islands, and the territorial waters, therefore, as extending three miles north of the northernmost point of the reef, X am to enclose, lor Sir iS.

Grey is amre of the reasons for v&amp;ich the Marquess of Crewe is very unwilling to create in Bin Saud's mind the impression that His Majesty's Government are indifferent to him, and, as will have been seen from Mr. Abrahams' letter of the 4th instant, it is only the supposed fact that the Turks are acting through such tried friends of His Majesty's Government as the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moharamera, that has seemed to His Lordship to justify the policy of leaving! him to negotiate direct. If the Government of India's enquiries should show that there is no foundation for this supposition - and it would aprear from their telegram of the 11th instant that the Sheikh of Koweit is unwilling to conrait himself - Lord Crewe is of opinion that before any farther conmmication is made to Bin Saud, HakKi Pasha should be asked informally if he has yet received tl^e views of his Government. It will be remembered that tl e conversa tion with His Highness was interrupted in order that he might obtain them, and the apparent loss of interest I in The under Secretary of State, I Foreign Office. MB/„u I in the miDject on the part of H 1 r Majesty's Government 1 may even have produced a stiffening in the attitude of | the Ottoman Oovernnent towardB Bin Saud, With reference to the Government of India's ue^sgraiu of t. e x4th Inntnnt f Hin Lordship is inclined to doubt whether any purpose mild be served by making representations to Haklci Pasha, and to allow matters to take their course. But he would suggest that if a Turkish decoration is conferred on the Sheikh of Koweit the bestowal of the British decorations approved in your letter No. 41531 of 15th September last should not necessarily be postponed until the King's birthday. As regards the last sentence of this telegram it seems desirable that the Sheikh should be acquainted with the British requirements, the innocent nature of Which will disabuse his mind of any idea that His Majesty's Government contemplate a forward or anti- 4 Turkish policy. I am to enclose for Sir £• Grey's concurrence draft of a telegram which Lord Crewe proposes to address to the Goveranent of India on the subject. I have, etc.. $ t r • Sd. T. w.

In amplification of my telegram No. 725, dated 23rd June 1914, repeating to you the telegram dated 23rd June sent by His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, to the Embassy at Constantinople, on the subject of Turkish negotiations with Bin Saud, I have the honour to repoxt that news has been received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the effect that Shaikh Mujbil iM Thakair, an influential Najdi mer chant, resident in Bahrain, whose brother's daughter was recently married to Bin Saud, has informed the Political Agent, Bahrain, that he had interviews with both the Turkish representative and Bin Saud. Both parties informed him that an arrangement was eventually arrived at. 2. Shaikh Mujbil did not see the text of the agreement, but he understands that the Porte was allowed to station five soldiers at each of the following places, 'Oqair, Qatif and Jubail to keep the Turkish flag flying but that no other Turkish garrisons would be placed in Hasa or Najd. Bin Saud receives a monthly allowance of £ T. 250 as ruler of Hasa. He col lects customs dues, deducts expenses of administration, and pays Turkey l-10th of the balance. He flies his own flag. Bin Saud's prestige in Bahrain has been greatly enhanced by these rumours- It is thought that he has agreed to exclude foreign traders and has been given ' carte blanche ' against Qatr. On the other hand, the Political Agent, Kuwait, has never heard any such story and apparently discredits it; I was myself inclined to do so on first hearing it, as I did indirectly before Shaikh Mujbil reached Bahrain, when he was on his way from Kuwait, However, the Political Agent, Kuwait, writing on the 16th June, agrees that further correspondence has undoubtedly taken place between the Turks and Bin Saud but Shaikh Sir Mubarak professes that he knows nothing on the subject. A Kuwait report says that the Turks have agreed to leave Bin Saud in pos session of Hasa and. Qatif on payment of a yearly sum of money. As far as one can venture to make any prophecy on these conflicting rumours- it would seem that the Turkish envoys have failed to arrive at any definite under standing with the Amir but have patched up some vague truce with Bin Saud which the latter will be free to abide by or neglect as he pleases and which they 'have misrepresented to Constantinople as a binding agreement. The next few weeks should show whether the Amir will show any hostility to British traders, and the only matter that affords me any concern lest the ' status quo ' should be altered to the detriment of British interests is that Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah is not very communicative.CONFIDENTIAL.

This telegram is supposed to have been sent by Anwar Pasha, the Minister of War, to Bin Saud. It will be observed that no mention whatever is made in the terms of the agreement of foreigners of the interests of Foreign Powers. 3. It Uknown that Abd-ul-Latif Mandjl has recently visited Bin Saud in Eiadh, but this solution cannot be accepted until some confirmation of the report has arrived from Bin Saud himself. Sir Mubarak is much disturbed at the thought that Bin Saud could have concluded a formal agreement without consulting him, and has sent ofE a messenger to Eiadh to ask for details. Unfortuntely he cannot return for some ten or twelve days, but I will inform you as early as possible of the reply. 4.

During night time, Amir of Katif proceeded witfe 25 camels to the house of Abdul Hussain bin Juma and arrested him. Some said he was carried to Uiassa and others said to Iliad.

Abdul Hussain however, was still not released and Bin Sy.ood told him that he ahould bring to him another 13000 Rials which also Sayid Selxnan collactad in Katif and sent.

Bin Saood plundered all the property of Abdul Hussain bin Juma leaving nothing for this big family. The property taken consisted of boats which with other things were auctioned by Bin Sadod, 11 Laks worth of pearls, li Laka worth of gold ornaments and buildings. He also took possession of the Sanads for amounts to the extent of 3 Laks of Rupees which were due to Abdul Hussain bin .Tuma by divers. Bin Saood told the divers to pay him only one-third of the sanad amounts and the balance he would forego. He also seized 200 gardens, some of them produce yearly 2 laks. Two of these gardens only will yield 2 laks when their trees will grow. 350 of 24-4-1914.

It appears there is no truth in the report regarding the letter, 'but Bin Saood arrested him only because he wanted to rob him of his property. 206 of 5th March 1914 . People began to speak that Abdul Hussain bin Juma was arrested because Bin Saood was offended at his asking for the case of Bosalani's claim against him, to be referred to Bahrain Majlis, and others said that Bin Saood was annoyed at Abdul Hussais coming to Bahrein and acquainting to Sheikh that he was unjustly demanding tax x from him, and that therefore he was arrested. The rumour further went on to say that Bin Saood did so because he feared Abdul. Husss-in having much influence in Katif would help Turks whan they would come to fight against him. 207 of 5th Marc h 1914.

(No. 335), Constantinople, May 12th, 1914, Sir, In his telegram dated the 8th May, which I repeated to you in my telegram No.281 of the 9th instant, His Majesty's consul at Basra reported the return from Koweit of the Turkish mission charged with the negotiations with Bin Saud, The moment appears to me an opportune one at which to review the question of His Majesty's Government's relations with Nejd from the Turkish Government's point of view. The policy of His Majesty's Government, afl I under stand it, has 'been directed to three ends only, namely, (1) to secure to British subjects free access to and proper treatment In Nejd, and more especially in the coastal regions; (2) to avert developments in that region which would disturb the general peace ofthe Gulf and the perfor mance of British duties there; and (3) to prevent, or at least postpone, anything which might lead to a general Arab outbreak, and so endanger the integrity of the Turkish dominions in Asia, His Majesty's Government having, by the agreement of the 29th July last,- recognised the entirely Ottoman character of Nejd and the El Hassa coast, it appears to me that the three alms just described can only be pursued consistently with that agreement by allowing the Porte to impose on Bin Saud, in fact, in so far as the El Hassa is concerned, the position which, as between ourselves and the Turkish Government, he is admitted to occupy In theory; in other words^ to require either that he shall administer El Hassa as a Turkish officer, or allow the Turks to administer it themselves. So far as the first km aim is concerned, Bin Saud might or might not, as an autonomous potentate, treat British subjects more favourably than the TurkishU-* Turkish Government would do, as for the second, there may be rival advantages in both alternatives, but I consider that there is something to be said in favour of having to deal with a Government which has now recognised our special position in the Gulf, should that Government be able to assert effective control over SI Hassa. Turning to the third object, it is obviously impossible to foresee the course of events in the Ottoman Arab world generally, but I think, on the whole, that the chances of an upheaval might be increased rather than diminished if an influential and centrally placed chief like Bin Saud were 5 to consolidate his pov/er and extend it permanently to the seaboard, I have analysed what I conceive to be the objects of the general policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Nejd, because it appears to me that recent British action may give rise to apprehension in the minds of the Turkish Ministers that His Majesty's Government are in reality pursuing another object^, namely, that of establishing relations with Bin Saud which will in some sort reduce him to a state of semi«dependency on Great Britain, It must be remembered that a series of coincidences have occurred which might encourage this suspicion in the Turkish mind, A month before Bin Saud's descent on El Hassa the British agent at Kowelt visited him in the interior. Early In the present year he was visited by other British officers, with the result that Hakki Pasha was Instructed to make a complaint In London, In March an endeavour of the Porte to enter into direct negotiations with Bin Saud through the emissary Omar Pauzl was foiled owing to the coldness J© the Sheikh of Kowelt, a British protege. At the beginning of April the commercial interests of the British India Company made it seem desirable that the British agent at Bahrein should give them a written recommendation to Bin Saud, a step which, however innocent■LbfL innocent the objects of the mission, was again open to misconstruction. Finally, when Bin Saud eventually agreed to meet the Turkish Commission, it was arranged that the meeting should take place at Kowelt, and he was visited twice by the British agent there while the negotiations were in progress. When to these is added the lively interest which His Majesty's Government have openly expressed, the contents ot their memorandum of the 9th March to Hakki Pasha, in which, inter alia , the Porte was reproached with asking Bin Saud to conduct all foreign relations through the Turkish authorities, and the repeated suggestions of mediation, it can only be expected that our attitude will be viewed with mt no little misgiving. It is not forte to say how well founded the Turkish suspicions may be, even if they exist, but it appears to me that, having concluded the agreement of StHjc July last, which secures us solid advantages in return for certain definite concessions to the Porte, we ere for the time debarred from doing anything which may be calculated to uphold Bin Seud as against the Bttoman Government. I think that, so long as there is any prospect whatever of the Turkish Government arranging matters with him by the dilatory and obscure methods of Oriental diplomacy, we should leave both sides severely alone, at any rate In appearances, and should only Intervene diplomatically if it became clear that the Porte are contemplating military measures, which fait Talaat Bey assures me is not the case. As a matter of fact, I believe the Porte will strain every diplomatic resource in order to secure a settlement on the lines of practically recognising Bin Saud»s independence in the interior while regaining control of the El Hassa^ coast. So far as I myself am concerned, ray principal reason for urging the desirability of refraining from further intervention of any kind for the present is that I consider it impossible to expect the Turkish Government to believe inI in the innocence of our motiveslarml intentionso If we speak to them of a. new situation of fact they will say that the ^ new situation dates fron before our agreement with them of July last. If we say that our only desire is to promote peace in Arabia end the integrity of the Empire, they will say, or rather, think, without saying it, that for us^f to treat Bin Saud in a way which he and all his neighbours will construe as a sort of recognition of his de facto independence is a dingular way of helping them to keep their Empire together. If we say that we have axes to grind in the Ottoman world in Turkey, and foresee no profit to ourselves in an upheaval, they will receive our c assurances with the politest incredulity. Other events have recently occurred which, taken in connection with the affairs of the Gulf, may have increased the Turkish suspicions of the trend of British policy. The Aziz Ali agitation, which moved Arab opinion over a wide area, and In connection with which my action was purely humanitarian, was rendered liable to misconstruction by the &lt;2- indisreet violence and partisanship of the 'Times'. It was A the conviction of the Grand Vizier that Aziz Ali had been employed by the Khedive in connection with his endeavours to p^repk^ the Sheikh of the Senoussi to make peace with the Italians, and it is not impossible that the Turkish Government may have some sort of evidence to support this supposition. Being at peace with Italy, they could not object openly to such afition on the part of Aziz Ali, but they have certainly resented the Khedive's intrigues with the Senoussi if the violence of the Grand Vizier's language respecting His Highness is any index of his feel ings in regard to them.

It seems to him essential that His Majesty's Govern ment should proceed very cautiously. Sksc The situation has been informally but carefully explained to Hakki Pasha, and it has been surgested by His Highness to his Government that he should be authorised to discuss the question here with the view to a satisfactory arranrenent being arrived at here. In these circumstances Sir K. Grey considers that nothing should be done until the result of Hakki Pasha's sugges tion is known. I an to add that point 'd' in the Viceroy's telegram of May 23rd to which your letter calls special attention does not appear to Sir E. Grey to bo open necessarily to the interpretation that the Turkish conditions definitely preclude any connexion or intercourse between Bin Saud and foreigners; the condition would seem merely to provide that -any oonrnmioation between Bin Saud , - , . O tttrrruXTz and foreign powers or their agents should take place through the ' /I authorities, a view which appears to Sir E. Grey entirely correct, and one in regard to which His Majesty's Government would not be justified in encouraging resistance on the part of Bin Saud, a Turkish subject, and specifically recognised as t:uch by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29th, 1913.

As far as I can gather he prides himself in having skillfully played us off against Turkey,and on-having,by causing Turkey to think he was considering the advisability of coming under British suzeranity,extracted better terms than he would other wise have obtained. If this is really his attitude of mind he will certainly not consider that he is beholden to us,or has anything to fear from us.

From— C aptain W. H. I. S hakespear, To— S ir A rthur H irtzel, K. C. B., Secretary, Political Department India Office, London. I have been through the papers which you were good enough to have sent to me and apparently some of the information which I sent to the Political Resident at Bushire from Riadh has never reached Government—the reason may be that, as I wrote to Mr. Lorimer privately, the letter may have been destroyed on reaching Bushire some six weeks cifter his death. ♦ I reached Riadh on the 9th March and found active preparations being made for the collection of a large force by Bin Saud ; I stayed and travelled with Bin Saud until the 15th and during this time had many opportunities of ascertaining his feelings and intentions. I would add that being on exceptionally intimate terms with Abdul Aziz and his whole family he fre quently showed me the confidential correspond- * Vide Foreign Secretary's note above. ence passing between him and other Arab* Chiefs, amongst them Sayid Mahomed al-Idrisi, the Imam Yahyah of Sana'a Bin Sha'alan, the premier sh-tikh of the great Anaize.h tribe and others of lesser impoitance, as well a &gt; his communications with the Turkish authorities. I did my best to discourage his confidences seeing that I had no official status, but as he insisted they may now be useful. Bin Saud was aware of the advent of Turkish troops and the new Vali of Basrah, Suliman Pasha, in Riadh before I met him in March, and fearing that the troops were intended for a des cent on Katif, Ojair and Hasa he had issued orders for a general mobilization of his troops {i.e., townsmen and villagers as distinct from the nomad Bedouin, who do not count for much). This mobilization only called up a small proportion of the available fighting strength of each village—some 30 per cent, was my estimate after many enquiries—but even then Bin Saud had anything from 5,000 to 7,000 well-armed and mounted men ready to his hand. The military efficiency of Bin Saud's arrangements will be realized when it is understood that some of the villages are nearly 150 miles from Riadh, that the mobilization was practically complete within a fortnight, and that 1,000 men were despatched and posted in the coast villages (particularly Katif) within the first week. Bin Saud told me that he w^s forced to make these preparations as he could not risk allow ing the Turkish troops to effect a landing on the coast unopposed. He intended no aggressive action but was determined on a vigorous defence. He was exceedingly anxious as to wha&amp; reply* he would receive from the Political Agent, * Reply is at Sub-Enclosure No. 2 in Serial No. Pobrom to his lettert of the 1st Babi-ath-Thani 1332 (51).

Turkish troops making for the coast. My position did not permit of more than counselling patience, deprecating any hostile movement and suggesting that in any negotiations which might be attempted he should be careful t Vide Sub-Unelosures and Enclosure to Serial reme tuber that he had given us (when he met J No- (37). Major Trevor and myself at Ojair in December) certain provisional assurances regarding the Trucial Chiefs and British traders on the coast. He said he had no intention of committing himself definitely to the Turks so long as he had any chance of arriving at an arrangement w^th the British Government or at least of obtaining our support or good offices in his negotiations with the Turks, but at the same time he could not wait indefinitely and continue to maintain p large force in the field ; and, unless he could obtain some sort of assurance he would be compelled to make his own arrangements in order to obtain a temporary respite at least from having to remain continually on guard. He told me then that the two conditions upon which the Turks would certainly insist would be the re-establish ment of their former garrisons, and (b) the exclusion of all foreigners ; the former he would never agree to whatever happened, and thought that by accepting the latter he might be able to buy his desired respite, though he saw that such acceptance would probably close the door to any further negotiations with the British Government, much as he desired an understanding witn them. The reports of the subsequent negotiations in April near Kuwait show that Bin Saud has not wavered in his resolve, nor do I think that he will so long as he can fence with the Turks, and continues to cling to his hope of drawing His Majesty's Government into any arrangement which he may make with the Porte.So much for Bin Baud's own attitude which I am convinced will not alter until he W despaired of obtaining the countinuance or good oflices of His Majesty's Government in In;, efforts for an arrangement with the lurks. One reason, and that the most cogent for Bin Saud's determined attitWe j is that he f,ek himself strong enough to oppose the Turks especially if he can keep the other great Arab Shaikhs firm in their resolution not to permit any further aggression or encroachment in Arabia by the Turks During the past year there has arisen a loose kind of confederation or alliance betweo,. the following Chiefs-Bin Sand, Imam Yahyah Saiyid Mahomed al-ldrisi, Bin Sha'alan and the Sharif of Mecca, with only Ibn Eashid, the Shammar Chief, left outsjde the coalition, Tho basis of the alliance is that the allied Chiefs should endeavour to settle their differences by agree- ment or arbitration as war between them only weakens all parties as against the common enemy (viz the Turks), that in the event of any aggression by the Porte upon any one of these ShaiVhn all should combine for resistance and mutual h 'lp. Ibn Eaahid has been left out of the con federation because the present ruler is a boy who cannot be trusted, who is hand in glove with the Turks and has no real authority over his own tribesmen. Whether the Turkish Govern ment is aware of this combination or not I do not know, but I presume that it is for it has been at great pains to strengthen Ibn Rashid with arms and treasure within the last six months. Before 1 left Kuwait on on the 3rd February I had heard rumours of large consignments of arms being despatched to Hail for Ibn Rashid from Damascus ; at Riadh Bin Sand told me that he had certain information to the same effect and that they must be intended by the Turkish Government for use against himself; in the north-central desert the news was confirmed ; and finally I was informed in the vicinity of the Hedjaz Railway by Chiefs in a position to know, that some 30,000 rifles (all magazine arms of Mauser or Mannlicher pattern) with bayonets had been railed from Damascus to the station Tebuk) on the Hedjaz line for Teimah, that hundreds of boxes (accurate numbers were not obtainabh) of ammunition accompanied the arms together with three breech-loading mountain guns (each said to be accompanied, I think, with some 500 shrapnel shell apiece) and thai the consignment filled three large Railway waggons ; further that three Europeans (probably European Turks) had taken a motor-car by the same route to Hail at about the same time (I think in January) who might be artillerymen for the mountain guns. In the nortnern desert it was common report that these arms were intended for Ibn Rashid and that he would probably make a move against Bin Saud within the year, perhaps in the autumn. Bin Saud may have received accurate information later of the quantities and description of arms and of tha plans conceited between Ibn Raslud and the Turks, and it is some such knowledge, I think, which prcbably accounted for his uncompromising and somewhat truculent attitude at Kuwait towards the Turkish deputation sent to interview him. It is action of this (UJ) k . ind in the faCe o{ correspondence of the descrip- yAA). ^ reporte(i * the p olitical Agent at Ku , vait m April which causes Bin Saud to view any Tmkish proposal with the greatest suspicion. From all that I heard throughout Central Arabia I feel convinced that the old methods of Turkish intrigue, of setting up one Arab Shaikh against another, will no longer have the success of past times in maintaining even that shadowy semblance of Turkish sovereignty over them which has hitherto passed unquestioned ; throughout the country I was struck by the contempt with which the Arabs all regarded the Turkish Government, its troops and its civil officials. In attempting to show of what little account in Arabia Turkish authority really iSj I am only endeavouring to explain that present Turkish methods invite further disasters. ^ I am aware that His Majesty's Government are committed to a policy of supporting and maintaining a strong Turkey in Asia and if such a desirable result can be brought about in Arabia so much the better. Unfortunately the Turkish Government appears to have no concep tion of its own weakness in Arabia, nor of the power and strength of the Arab Chiefs, nor does it appear to realize what are the probable consequences likely to ensue should forcible miasures have to be resorted to in the end. The reports from Kuwait describing the course of the; negotia tions with Bin Saud I think^ sufficiently bear out the above view. The nearest parallel to the i urkish difficulties with Bin baud which I can draw is our own case in Somaliland, only exaggerated ten times worse. Knowing something of the country, its difficulties in transport, supplies and the like, I would hesitate to suggest that less than two divisions, completely equipped for a long desert war, would be able to re-establish and maintain effectively the former Turkish, occupation of the Hasa province. The Turkish occupation before May 1913 was not effective in any sense, aad only existed because Bin Saud was more occupied elsewhere. He could have carried out his coup of May 1913 at any time in the last five years. So far as my limited knowledge goes the Turkish Government does not appear fco be in a position at present to undertake any expeditions in Arabia, nor indeed for many years to come. mus a so e remembered that any future campaign against one Shaikh is exceedingly likely to raise the whole of Arabia against the Turks. It may be argued that the Arab tribes have not the necessary cohesion to maintain for any length of time a united front against the Porte.3 To a Certain extent this is true, but at the present moment years of falsehood, intrigue and op pression on the part of Turkish officials combined with the disastrous loss of Turkish prestige resulting from the Tripoli and Balkan wars have had their effect. Moreover, the Arabs have now found a leader (Bin Saud) who stands head and shouldeis above any other Chief and in whose star all have implicit faith. The other Shaikhs of the Arab alliance refer all kinds of matters to Bin Saud for his advice, more especially those affecting their relations with the Porte. I am convinced that present Turkish methods in Arabia, if peisisted in, will end in disaster— Turkey has not the power to coerce Arabia and should matters, with Bin Saud in regard to the Hasa province for instance, come to a head, the probable result will be a combination of all the Arab tribes, the expulsion of Turkish troops and officials from the Hedjaz, Yemen and Asir and the establishment of an independent Arabia with a loose form of confederation of which Bin Saud will be the head, while the holy cities of Mecca and Medina will pass under the absolute rule of the Sharif's family with the consent of Bin Saud, I admit that it is always rash to pro phesy ^ but I have heard the subject discussed so often in Arabia on these lines and by so many widely separated Chiefs that I cannot avoid the conclusion that the Turkish Government is at present riding for a very bad fall in its present Arabian policy. If the British policy of a strong Turkey is ever to be realised in Asia the Porte must be convinced oi its mistake, however unpalatable the process may be. The only solution which I can see is a radical change on the part of the Port^ towards a more straight-forward and honest policy with the important Shaikhs. Most of them are quite willing to accept Turkish sitzerainty so long as it is one only in name and does not import meddling in their affairs In the case of Bin Saud for instance—all he desires is to be left alone as the ruler of Nejd, which he is now in fact, allowed to collect his own taxes and customs and to administer the Shara's Law in the old time-honoured way. If the Porte would nominate him Mutaserif or Vali of Nejd on these conditions he would be willing to pay it a nominal tribute in a lump sum per annum, and I feel sure would loyally keep his part of the bargain as a Turkish vassal. He has no ambitions to become the Khalif of Arabia, and though his commanding influence will no doubt lead a)i the other Chiefs more or less during his lifetime, I do not think he would ever embark on a campaign to set himself up as Sultan of all Arabia. It may be said that any solution on the lines suggested above will leave the whole of Arabia open to the exploitation of Foreign Powers, Great and otherwise. At present no Great Power lias any real interests in Arabia with the exception of Great Britain, whose interests are confined to the coast-line, though I believe Italy is said to be trying to develope interests in Asir or Yemen, The discussion of this aspect of the subject requires more accurate and more extensive knowledge of recent events than is available to me ; therefore it is with diffidence that I venture to suggest for consideration that with the Porte recognized and supported by His Majesty's Government as the Suzerain Power in Arabia and provided that the Turkish Government dealt frankly with His Majesty's Government in matters regarding Arabia no Foreign Power would find it an easy pro position to make good a footing in the country, apart from the fact that along nearly the whole littoral British influence is paramount and of very considerable account even in those portions actually administered at the moment by Turkey. To sum up, the difficulties of the problem in Arabia are :— (a) The utter inability of the Porte to coerce Arabia at present or for many years to come. (h) The strong position in a military and geographical sense with which Nature has endowed the Arabs. (c) The probable coalition of all Arab tribes in the event of attempted coercion. (d) The desire of His Majesty's Government to promote a strong Turkey in Asia without detriment to legitimate British interests. The remedies, so far as I can venture to suggest them, seem to be :— (1) The acceptance by the Porte of the de facto independent status of the great Shaikhs whilst maintaining a nominal suzerainty. (2) A franker and more honest attitude by the Porte towards the great Shaikhs. (3) Less suspicion on the part of the Porte towards British policy in Arabia with recog- ' nition of the special position which Great Britain there enjoys.; (4) A frank invitation by the Porte for British co-operation in Arabian affairs.Dated the 26th June 1914.

Tn the papers you had sent to me and also in others which came to me officially in Kuwait, I have noticed thatTSaiyid Talib of Basrah seems to be regarded as a ' deus ex machina' or .oIve r of aU local ills in Arabia and Mesopotamia. I cannot understand how he has acquired this position, or rather how he has managed to maintain it in the reports of our own officers. The' man is a strong, wilful, utterly unscrupulous character usually heavily in debt and ronseauently importunate. He has a dozen or more murders to his credit and holds Basrah in the hollow of his hand by means of a band of armed men who occupy his house there like a fort, issuing thence to execute the# master's behests in the matter of replenishing his exchequer wheu required. No Vali at Basrah is ever able to carry on his administrative work unless he first agrees to be the willing tool of Saiyid Talib. Bin Saud, Shaikh Mubarak, and Shaikh Khazal all subsidise him with a regular monthly or annual salary solely to protect themselves from continual extravagant demands accompanied bv threats. Not one of these Chiefs, however, would trust Saiyid Talib with any negotiation on their own behalf. Saiyid Talib generally induces the Central Government to depute him as their envoy for the solution of their difficulties in Mesopotamia, the local Vali generally being his strongest supporter for the simple reason that unless Saiyid Talib is allowed some of the pickings always available on these occasions, matters usually come to a deadlock through his instru- mentality^ %Qrad from Reuter's Government and Pmn mi. Jessage to Times from Constantinople -says it is nnderst! od that article in Anglo-TurMah Convention debars Britain from entering into relations with Bin Sauu of Nejd as Amir of independent Nejd, but seeing that he has occupied Gulf Ports of El Beiba and El Adjeir it is impossible for Britain not to, have relations with him whether he beeonies Turkish Vali or remains independent chieftein. British Embassy, message says, is takh .g steps with regard to iomier contingency. Latter depends on Porte' ability to conduct military operations in Arabia. &amp; M.

Prom the attached independent account of the quarrel between Shaikh Abdullah and hia cousins, it appears that Tusuf Kanoo has perhaps exaggerated the tension between them. Shaikh Abdullah does not appear to be a man of any strength of charac ter. It was with difficulty that he was persuaded to undertake the duties of Chief of Doha after the mirier of Shaikh Ahmad as he prefered pearl dealing to responsibility; and he more than onee during his father's life time threatened to resign owing to Shaikh Ahmad's sons not treating him with proper considera tion. His present petulant attitude shows that he has not gained strength with responsibility. Shaikh Khalifah not Shaikh Abdullah is Shaikh Jasim's eldest son. My records do not show why Shaikh Jasim nominated him as his successor. The recent quarrel has ostensibly been settled, but there is no doubt that Bin Saud would find a considerable following from the malcontents among the Qatr Shaikhs, although the majority of common people apparently favour Shaikh Abdullah. The news in my No.24-C as to Bin Saud's intervention having been invoked was obtained from Shaikh Muqbil, and I think that there is no doubt that he is being egged on from Basrah to realise his old ambition of absorbing Qatr. Consi dering Shaikh Muqbil' b relations with Bin Saud I am inclined to think that the information was in the nature of a 'ballon d'essai' .

Were a Bralmi or 3aluoh Chief to behave ae Abdullah has ^ i done on the alightest provocation I should not look on it as having any special signlfioance* Petulance is on© of their outstanding charactoriotico,and it has the deoired effect on the tribe:moreover the Chief ie a chief by Divine Right.

Then for me to visit &lt;atr and,after consulting Shaikh Abdullah, call all his relations together,and tell them plainly that Turkey renounced all claim to Qatr,and con- se(jiently,Bin Baud, as a Turkish official,has been warned off, Advise then to remain at peace among themselves and prevent the coast villages from harbouring bad characters especially during the distress that mould ensue this ■winter. From the attitude of Shaikh Abdullah and his relations, then and in the immediate future we could judge whether it would be advisable to support him personally,and make an agreement with him. For me to go to atr in the 'Lawrence' merely to form an opinion on Abdullah's capacity and the chances of the success of his rule would I think be a mistake. The minor Shaikhs would certainly think I had come to make an agreement. If they think I have failed,it will give confidence to the Din Saud faction. If they think I have succeeded they will raise the cry that Abdullah has sold his country to us t this probably means his flight or assassination# Yesterday I received a parcel from Shakespeare con taining a present for Bin Saud.

This view would appear to be correct, provided that the requests of such persons are in accordance with treaty provSions Tw L f'conimunication from llakki Pasha, detailed fn FoS Department telegram No. 428-S., dated 10th July last. It is unlikelv hat Bin Sa ud attributes his settlement with the Turkish Government to our previous e%rts on his behalf, though he may perW b! aware that the satisfactory terms he has obtfined are in part due to our presence in the field The arrangement between Bin Sa'ud and Turkey is not hkely to be of long duration according to the soecifir expectations of the former, who is not believed hereL at WaS to have become a pro-Turk, to have been in the least affected by the pan-Islamic sentiments of Anwar Pasha or to have ceased to regard the interests of himself and his people as paramount.' i ^ It 1 w j 11 , be seen that tbe Bahrain and Kuwait views differ little th™,*^ ^ latter is slightly more pro-English and anfo-Turkish than the former. This fs onlv natural as tinged with that violent hatred of the Turk which is so maT-WU .1! 7 tenst'c of the Shaikh of Kuwait. My personal opinion inclines to the Kuwait WWh ? T i ? a reconclllatlon of Turkish and Najd interests as impossible' Whether it will be more easy to reconcile British and Naid interests is to i unfortunately almost as doubtful. The first rock on which we sh^H ^ wiU be Katar and the Katar problem appears to me as insistent as any we have to deal with for the moment on ths Arabian shores of the Gulf Tm ! not however, easy to see how leisure can be found just now to deal with thS petty but intricate problem. Fortunately up to the present no confirmation has been received of the rumour reported under the hiding ' Katar ' in BusW summary for the period ending with the 31st August; and it may, therefore I hope be discredited. There is no doubt that the death of Shaikh AbdnllTh h' Jasim woud but add to the difficulties of a solution. bl114 While I have no wish to appear to run counter to the policy acc ¥ r ® d A ; I( ^ home of not adding to Turkey's diffiduties nor of running the from the Empire, I cannot refrain from pointing out the danger oll^ g Sa ud and the Shaikh of Katar entirely to their own devices, a policy wuch, it eeems to me can only result^and at no distant data-in our bemg presented with a fair accompli in the annexation of Katar. 5 From Katar to the Trucial Coast is but a step and, however difficult it may be to keep Bin Sa'ud out of Katar, it will be doubly difficult to turn him out of Katar once he is there, and such an undertaking would undoubtedly embitter our relatio a with him permanently and would, therefore, be greatly to be regretted. 6 The present turn of affairs in Europe, so favourable to the Slavs and so destructive of German influence, to which the young Turk party have recently been looking as their strongest support against the hostile elects w ^ y imagine— not without reason—to threaten them, encourages to &gt; 0 P® tl i at T ^ Sg Umon to Anglophile feelmg may be the next feat™ of pobcy miffht therefore be possible, even at some risk of exciting larkisti suspicion, to proceed quietly with our settled policy in the Persian Gulf of preserving, so far as I humanly possible, the status quo and therefore the independence ofKatai. this p^ it is of course needless to remark, no hostility to Turkey finds a place. 7. I therefore make bold to solicit the permission of Government to proceed with the steps advocated in correspondence ending with my No. Cf.-52, dated 21st Julv last, and also that the Political Agent, Bahrain, may be directed d^creetly to pursue the policy of keeping in touch with events in A1 Hasa and Bm Saud s subordinates in that province. It is even worthy of consideration, 1 venture to suggefct, whether a warning might not be addressed to the Amir imp ymg that Government has seen with much concern that there were discussums m the family of the late Shaikh Jasim bin Abdullah bm Thani; that the new ShaiKh, Abdullah, the eldest son and lawful heir of the late Shaikh, had, in accordance with universal —custom, succeeded to the Shaikhdom; that his maintenance m that position and the independence of the Shaikh of Katar were objects of their solicitude and tnat thev hoped that any malcontents of his family who were short-sighted enough not to perceive that their true interests lay in the enhancement of the dignity and posi tion of the head of their family, would receive no encouragement at the hands ot the Amix or from his officials. 8. I hope that a letter on these lines would make the Amir pause and that such a communication, combined with closer relations on our part with the Bin Tnam family, would go far to prevent a break in the friendly relations with Bm Sa ud which must, for some time—and we may hope permanently—form the cardinal feature in our policy in that quarter of the Persian Gulf; . v CytA A G.M.

He wished to go t Bombay to buy medicines, but I informed him that lie would probably be arrested there, and I must get permission from you before giving him a safe conduct. He has returned to Hofuf, and I have ordered his medicines from Bombay for him. If Bin Saud still wishes him to go to Bombay may I give him a safe conduct ? Following is a translation of letter received from in answer Bin Saud to one I wrote him when you were here. ' You have Informed me of the arrival of British troops at Bahrain m of Turkey's following the instlga- -tlon of German intriguers, and of the necesiity of pro- -tecting British interests and those of Her friends.

Hie coming is due to the state ot mrki^h sffairs and to the hi :h-handed treatment that he had received at the hands of the Turks during the last two years»and then to the arrival of Javil at Basrah,and the fact that under the guise of warlike measures the Turks started pursuing their personal motives against hia — motives which it is difficult to explain except verbally at interview. Placing his trust in the old relations subsisting between us and his family generally and particularly between him and myself perso^lly,, aiyi 1 ralib man -ged to secure a mission for himself from the Inspector of Turkish -ar affairs some 20 days before his departure,and this mission enabled him to leave Basrah and afforded him^Ut .molestation Jriip any body.

Your honoured letter of I7th luharrana 1333 has reached me in a fortunate hour here at Kuma,by the hand of our friend Abdul Latif Ibn Mandll* I was very glad to get It and also to re« colve your expresaion of satisfaction at learning of our occupation of Basrah and the dhatt-al-Arab,and of the contentment of the inhabitants. Jlnce then our troops have occupied Kurna. The place Is conveniently situated for defence,and upto a certain point the Turks fought their guns well,but ultimately they gave up the fight,and nearly 1300 of them were made prisoners,and altogether upwards of 20 guns have so far been captured from them. It is not hidden from you that the British Government had no wish to go to war with Turkey,but her hostile actIons,resuiting from the Intrigues and Incitement of Germany,were so Intolerable that we had no alternative. But as we have e&gt; lained to the people of iasrah and Kurna,lt Is the Government of Turkey only with which we are at v /ar,and we have no object against the people of the country and the jpabs. On the contrary we wish to be their friends and suppor ters and hope that under the British flag they will enjoy the utmost freedom and Justice both in regard to their religion -nd their secular affairs. JispeciaHr ly in regard to religious matters you need be under no sort of apprehension. It Irs not hidden from you that the British Government : iag more :.iuhaisnadan sub jects than any other Government, and you will have^ seen irora the roclaaation,of p/hioti I enclose printed copy,that we havo sxpreaily undertaken tdi ' inspect and preserve the holy places of pilgrLnage both in the Hejaz and Msaopotamla* As for yourself I hope that as the result of what has happened your affairs mill prosper nore than before,because your territory will become free from that annoyance and interference on the part of the Turks from which you have suffered hitherto. As regards your friend oaiyid falib,! met his esteemed father at Basrah and told him what was in my mind regarding his son,and It was to this effect. Opto the declaration of war he did not cease to make claims to us which were not possible of acceptance, and did not agree to the favourable terms offered to him;yet the British CJovernment is forgiving,and though iiaiyid Talib has been ill-advised and misled yet neither the Government nor I,its representative, have any ill-will against oaiyid i'alib. But what I thOUgfttwas necessary in his case was thMt,for rea sons which you will understand,it would be better that he should not return to iasrah for a time until the affairs and the inhabitants of the town had settled down. A little later 1 shall be ^uite ready to see him and talk over his affais jbith him,and if then his attitude is satisfactory and he submits to the wishes of the Qovamment,! may be able to re commend his being allowed to return to Basrah on suitable terms. I hope by the time this reaches you our friend Captain Jhakespear will be with you,and he will inform me of hat passes between y u,and you may be sure that they will be regarded by myself and the British Government with all sympathy.

Apart from th^• : *wmmtrnm CONFIDENTIAL, No, 3-13 of 1915. From To Captain \V,H,I Shakospoai*, I,A Political Officer on Special Duty, Tlie Political Resident in the Persian Oulf i3asrah. 4th January 19X5, Sir, In continuation of my letter No, 3-/ dated vth December 1914 from Kuwait I have the iionoui* oo report that,leaving Kuwait on the I2th December,I reached Abdul Aziz M Bin oaud''s canp on the 3x3t December 1914, me Ailir's last letter had led me to expect him to be neai^er Kuwait,bub poor grazing north of the Dahana and the presence of a large force compelled him to camp at Khuf3a( about Lat 26? 12* N,Long 45? 35^ E) and en tailed upon me a journey of some 550 miles. I was received very cordially by 'Bin Saud' and his brothers and met many friends among his headmen, 2, General political situation . It wil-t be ox interest to note here that the attitude of Central, Arabia,so far as I am able to gauge A in this camp,is very sympathetic towards Great Britain,antagonistic uo Germany and one of hatred to Turkey combined with a sense of relief and a hope that at last the machina- ti-tns of the Ottoman Governnent in Nejd may come to an end. There is unaffected rejoicing at the British- 7 / success eg in Basrah and Guraa, while not a trace of fanatical spirit adverse to areat Britain is visible. By far the most potent factor,other than the perso nal predilections of the Amr and his family,in pro ducing tins favourable result in Wahabi Arabia has - been the British Proclamation regarding the Holy Places. X was informed by some v /ho were present that Abdul Aziz 5t Bin 3aud ,! had the proclamation read out at one of his 'Majlis' in Buraidah when a large nunber of his notables were present,comnenting on it as proof of British sincerity and drawing comparisons much to our advantage between the Grovernment which, though of another faith,was prepared to bind itself by such a proclamation and^which had continually oppressed its subjects,though of its own faith,and attempted to proclaim a 'jehad' while allying itself to another Christian Power. I can say with assurance ■ that a religious war as hoped for fry the Ottoman k 4 ..-v Government has no supporters in Central Arabia, 'Bin Saud' himself has already practically imprisoned a Turkish Officer in Has a, sent to him to help train his troops for the war and is keeping four Ulema S-fe Bu raidah in what may be described as honourable confine merit. These four men are |of the .Vahabi sect,residents of Baghdad or Karbala and were sent by Turkish autho rities to preach 'jehad'. It will be evident from the above that the general situation politically tnrough- out 'Bin Baud's' territories is as favourable to ■— Great Britain as can be desired. 3. Campaign against 'Ibn ilashid '_ . Before procee ding to deal with 'Bin Baud's' relations with the British Government it will he well to clear the ground by explaining his present relations with his neighbours, 'Bin Saud' in common with all other^Chiefs received repeated requests from the Sublime Porte to proclaim a 'jihad' against the British. The part m-J J jpljf' is 3&gt;7 assigned to him was the protection and defence of Basrah and Baghdad from any British advance in lower Mesopotamia. 'Ibn Hashid' was go have joined forces vvii/1 t'.t o iiov/alai Anaizah ),Howaitat, Bani i3aj£hr, dhera- rat and other western tribes near the Hedjaz ^ilway and rao/ed on the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt,while the Sharif of Mecca,the Imam Yaliya and the Saiyid Idrisi ' were td&gt; have secured the Red Sea littoral and defen ded the Holy Places and other towns and ports in xemen and Hedjaz. The plan miscarried for the sane reasons that tne attempt to provoke a ' : Jliiad n has failed -— the Ottoman Government failed to take into account the irritation its policy for the last five years has produced in i^aola, failed to foresee that combined action between the tribes would be impossible without some more or less lasting composition of their feuds,enmities and jealousies^and failed to re alise that religious enthusiasm could not be invoked on the flimsy pretexts it advanced. The kbhhbh result has been that the Chiefs consulted each other before moving and apparently came to the conclusion that it would be more profitable to await events than to take up the Turkish cause. 'Bin Baud',the Sharif of Mecca and the Shaikhs of the great Anaizah tribe in Northern Arabia decided to hold together and re main in constant communication. Tt 3in 3aud ,? and ?, Ibn xiashid' had been on bad terms since the summer and the former,having decided to open hostilities as soon as the season permitted,apprised the Anaizah shaikhs in the North of hid intentions and obtained a promose of their support against flbn jiashid'. 4. At the same time he informed the Turkish Govern ment that being at fe^Lud with 'Ion liashid' it was impossible for him to move north for the protection of Mesopotamia, leaving Kejd open to attack,unless and until 'Ibn Rashid' moved on Egypt. Having thus found a legitimate excuse for taking no action likely toVol) 2. 2 '-i conflict with British intentions in Irak, Tt Bin Sand' set aoont his preparations for a campaign against 'Ibr j.u-ishid' f.or the doable purpose of keeping him from any advance tv/ards and carrying out his original plan to crash him. 'Ton Bashid' is now of very small account,there are frequent dissensions 'between his tribes and he has not the power to con trol them,while some of them have actually trans ferred their allegiance to 'Bin Saud'. 'Bin Saud has collected at this canp some 3,000 to 4,000 of his townsmen,has the whole of t e Untair and .Ajman Bedouin tribes within call and has EstiM issued orders for another 4,000 townsmen uo join his standards within the next few daysL His preparations are on a scale he has not attempted since I9II(?) when the Sharif of Mecca at Turkish instigation made his incursion into Washm. He will move within the week and hopes to find and crush 'Ibn Rashid' before the end of January,un less the latter has moved westwarda,in which case new . plans will have to be made. 5. Relations with British aoverruncn t. It is un- necessary to recall what passed between Briuish offi cials 8216.'Bin Saud' up to the meeting he had had with Lieut: Go Ion el Grey near 5 Kuwait at the end oi April 1914. 'Bin Saud' assures me that the three months' time which was arranged for at the meeting at ojair in December 1913 having been sxceoded by a month and having received frequent letters from Shaikh bir uuba- rak-as-Subah urging him to come north to meet the Turkish officials,holding out strong hope^ of a satis- factory solution with them,he proc.eeaea to m - WvIj , feeling sure to* (as he had kept A Political A^ent Bahrain fully informed of his movements) that he would be able to consult the Political Agent,, before closing with the Turks. On reaching Subaihiyah he was astonished to receive Jn^asAr -a letter advising him to refuse to Subarak-as -Sub all Ji refuse to treat with the Turks and intimating that he himself would not be present at the negotiations as he had previously promised. Added to this volte-face on Shaikh Mubarak 1 s part he understood from Lieut- (Jolonel Grey/that His Majesty^ 3-overnment were not prepared to support him at all as they had concluded an agreement with the Porte and could not jeopardise their own interests,especially as the Turks had re- tused their friendly offer of mediation. There v/ere otner matters between him and Sir Mubarak-as-Subah wnich added further to his resentment with the result that he arranged with Saiyid Talib -one of the Turkish Delegates) that the negotiations should be kept sec ret from Mubarak, The negotiations culminated even tually in a series of conditions set down in draft for the sanction of the Porte and it was this draft which was sent to Constantinople. Several of the conditions were flatly refused at first by 'Bin Saud'' but later he agreed to their inclusion on the express assurance of the delegates that they were required to save the face of the Turkish Government,which however had no intention of insisting on their execution, sub sequently fimans,EM congratulatory telegrams and letters cams to him from the Port© and various Minis ters. 6, Such was the position — one of complete poli tical detachment from the British Government and of fence with the Turkish — when,about Diie 20th October MfHw sand 11 r•calved^information that Captain ShaKes- • pear was being despatched to him. He had meanwhile received letter^ telegrams and promises innumerable from the Porte,but in the hops that my deputation meant that the British Government were again conside ring his old request to come under their protection he continued so fence .• ith the Turks, He next received at the end of October the letters from Kuwait which formed enclosures to Lieut--Colonel Grey T s lefcuer&gt;4-0 No. 0-41 dated SIst October 1914,arid later, about 'the ^ middle of November,came the news of the declaration'' of war between Turkey and Great Britain and the docu- ments mentioned in Kuwait Agency letter No. C-45 dated 7th November 1914, including the Acting Resident T 3 letter of assurances dated I4th Zu-al -Haj 1333 (3rd November 1914). In this last document he was asked to commit himself to war openly with Turkey and in return the British Government (1) guaranteed him against reprisals by the Turks (2) guaranteed him against attack by sea (5) informed him that his 'de facto' position in Mejd and Has a would be recognised and that they were prepared to enter into treaty relations wiiii M.. ■ ( 7, Abdul Aziz,who is animated by intense patriotism for his country,a profound veneration xor his religion and a single—minded desiro to do his best for nis people by obtaining for them lasting peace and security now found himself in a difficult position. He trusted the British Government as he trusted no other;tie ue- sired the closest relations with them and as proof of his sincerity had continued to fence with the Turks with some risk to himself but without farthering their aims;he was now asked to commit himself to open war with his most powerful and bitter enemies (the Turks) and that by the Power which six months earlier had informed him it could not Intervene on his behalf and had left him free to make his own terms with the Turks. It W8S ru $8 Had reeelved assurances but the docu- ^ ment was a vague latter, did not specify whether the assurances were limited 3 !^ the present war or also Included the future,gave no hint whether other condi tions would be required oi plater and could not he regarded as a binding instrument between two parties for the future;moreovor,hi3 country is surrounded on id « Turkish vassals and were- Turkish intrigue and aid to produce in the future a combination too powerful for him to meet alone,how far would these assurances apply? In vie? of these uncer tainties the risk of laying himself and his country open to the perpetual hostility of the Ottoman Govern ment and such of their vassals as they could move against him was too great to he lightly undertaken,'but as evidence of his sincere desire to assist the British Government without hopelessly compromising himself he had kept Ibn ilashid to his ground and by his example and lead induced the Arab world what might have been actively hostile attitude to be one distinctly sympa thetic towards Great Britain. 8, I did my best to remove the misapprehensions in dicated above bub finding that nothing short otS a trea ty with clauses categorically stating the obligations on 'both sides would satisfy him,t nd iii oi'tier to crys tal! ze what was in his mind I suggested that matters would bo expedited if I were enabled to xorward a pre liminary draft containing what he was prepared to ac cept and what he desired. To this he agreed,and I have u''the honour to enclese herswitli an Arabic copy and a W 7 rough n ef the Lraft. thoroughly * -^^understaads t at this draft is merely an BXtmepf U produce something more or less definite on which to work and that it will probably undergo considerable alteration,some conditions being removed and others substituted. However His Majesty's Government may de sire to vary the conditions it should be borne in mind that 'Bin Baud' has no intention of abandoning his neutral position with freedom to make his own arrange ments with the Turks (and he is confident he can secure from the*so to speak a very good 'second best') until he holds a signed and sealed Treaty with the British Government,nor will he nove a itep further tov/ards making matters either easier for us or more difficult present war Is concerned. iuntil iae obtains in that Treaty aome very solid ;) rantee of his poaition v.lth Great Britain praotiwoif' u..s oii^eraln, .'{ranted this,he can be relied upon to use all his resourees and imense influence in Aa'^abia on our side not only in the present war but aiterwards and to continue after its conclusion to have '''■''-''v- S 3 '-'ii any other Foreign Power without first comnunicating with us. He begs for the earliest possible ' % ' L * £j - 1,eat ^ r his neutral position aembarrasses .'.Jin considerably with tiie Turks and failing a very early comprehensive agreement with us he must in self- doience and to avoid reprisals give some practical pronf ci his intentions to side with the Turks. There is ncjffehreat imp ied in this for a bitter hatred of the - ■■^s is almost an obsession with Abdul Aziz,but he reccgnises that failing British protection he must make i ?e 'enemy and at once prove himself a friend ~~ for him there is no half-way house. 9. J. venture to submit that 'Bin Baud' in effect, asks for little more than what has already been con veyed in the Acting Resident's assurances.if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis,and if they are interpreted libe rally and generously. In exchange 'Bin Saud' '.offess to make himself a British vassal for sood. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy :- (a) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd,though very real to Bin Baud,need give us no anxiety — we have nc reason to suppose they win. be more successful in the future than they have been within the last two or three decades,while guaranteed from attack by sea 'Bin Baud' will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hiuherto;should they become threatening strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which Bin Baud could not cope himself 0(b) we should probably be called upon to act as i ^ arbiters some//hat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab jhailthf alon^ the coast ar^^Bin v- iUd,a duty largely to the advantage of oiir own interests. On the other hand the advantages seem to be con— siderable :— (a) complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Grtlf. h (b) similar complete control of the Aims Traffic, (c) l^e Practical exclusior of .Torei t ! 5n Powers and influence in Central Arabia. (d) The security induced by British Suzerainty and ir Bln Saudis' strong control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great Impetus to trade through the Persian ...ailf ports,probably diver ting a share of what now passes through the fled Sea ports, (e) The groat influence 'Bin Baud' has over Mu&amp;to- rnadan opinion in Arabia,an influence likely to increase as the Turkish Sap ire breaks up and the Khaliphate of the Sultan is 'iUe3tioned ,will be a British asset. Arab (f) 'Bin Baud's' 1 Influence with all^tribes and particularly with the Northern Anaisah.with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia will bring us in close contact. 10. Kbalifate of ts lau . Having referred to the Khalifate of Islaii above perhaps it will be as well to explain that we have little need to fear an attempt on the part of Bin Saud or his family to arrogate this title The Wahabis only acknowledge the first four Khalifs and no subsequent ones. In ticonversation with 'Bin Saud' 1 I gathered tn t most Arabs other thai ..ahabis and probab ly also most ivliuia omadans hacl their faith in the of the Saltan severely shaken by the circumstances of' U, : .. Abdul liami d's deposition and Iviahoniod aphid's accession Hie Arabs no?/ anticipate a similar revolution with ^ Mahomed Reshad and Enver Pasna as the principals and ^ should it come to pass tnao the latter becomes sultan expressed ' will the op in i ans I hear ^indicate that the Khalifat iTDy the common consent of Islam revert to the descendants of the Prophet's family in Mecca, of whom the present head is the Sharif and who I feel sure would command 'Bin baud's' support in such an event rather than his antagonism. II. Conclusion . This report has run to a conside rable length,but in view of the present favourable political situation locally,the instability of all Arab opinion and affairs,the far-reaching issues involved and uhe urgency of commmieating some adequate assurance to Bin 3aud at a very early date,I. have felt it justi- fled,more particularly to show clearly Abdul Aziz's v ■ i| \ . attitudo of mlnJ. . / pw.-'ioiiv»j point of view. The balancing of the responsibilities which we will incur with the advantages which are likely to acc rue from the conclusion of a Treaty on the lines of the attached preliminary draft rests with higher authority f but X would venture to reiterate the extreme urgency of the matter. 'Bin 3aud is prepared to meet Sir Percy cox in the vicinity of Zuoair, but he will not move north wards until he has settled with 'Ibn Rashid' and not even then unless the Treaty which he desires has assumed a practically final form,which he is prepared to accept. His reason is that he cannot take any further risk of irritating the Ottoman Government unless he can be assured of British protection,having already pleaded to it that he could not leave his own territories. I would venture to suggest that probably considerable time will be saved,seeing how difficult communication in present circumstances is,ii I were empowered to treat with Bin Saud,the draft clauses acceptable to and what is not U: ii) li| • 1accaptablo to His Majesty's (iovernraant being co'-mnmil oated to me.

There were about 30 men with him. We met Bin Saud at ,, Khuf8a tt near Riadh. Two days after our arrival Sayed Talib of* Basra^ ® ■ who had been for some time with Bin Saud^left for Kuwait. Next day Bin Saud marched with his forces towards Jarab in order to fight with Bin Rashid. After marching for several days we reached Jarab. On our way f at each stage ^parties of Bedew-ams joined us. Bin Saud was riding a horse but Captain Shakespear was on a camel. One day before the fighting Bin Saud and his son, Turki^ told the Sahib that he should not accompany them to the battle but had better either go to Qasim or to Zilfi where they would meet him after finishing the fighting. 'Sahib' did not agree and said it was dishonourable for him- to sweturn back and that he would accompany them in the battle. I heard the talk my self, as my tent was quite close to ^Sahib's'tent^ and his butler,who was present at the interview^also told me so. Next morning at 6 A.M. bin Rashid's troops were sighted and in less that two hours the enemy came fairly close to us. Bin Saud's forces dug ditches at a distance of about 500 yards* behind the fighting line and all the kit, tent and all sorts of luggage was loaded on camels which were made to sit in the ditches. Sahib left all of his servants but one, Hadi of Kuwait, in the ditches^and himself took a camera and mounted on a camel with Hadi. They went towards the place of fighting. He had instructed Hadi to keep the camel when he dismounted and wait for him at that place while he went on foot. I was about 500 yards from where Sahib dismounted and saw him wall. He went on to a mound and took photo- -grapha. Bin Saud ordered a general attack at 8 A.M. cavalry being on the right and left flanks and infantry in the centre.
