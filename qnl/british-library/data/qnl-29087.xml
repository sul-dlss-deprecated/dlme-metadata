(1) The Assyrian Patriarchal Family in Cyprus, I am relieved to know that it has been agreed to continue the allowance after April 30th for a further short period. I fully recognise that there may be a case for discontinuing the allowance but I was disturbed if, as originally reported, it was to be cut off without any notice. I very much doubt whether there is any possibility of funds being provided from Church sources to maintain this Family, but I will consult with those who advise me in these matters. It may well be that, as my predecessor said, in the end the support of the Family must devolve upon the Mar Shimun and his people. (2) A visit of the Mar Shimun to his Bishops. I am vary interested to hear of the proposal that the Mar Hhlmun a r _&amp; his Bishops should meet in India and to know that steps ut* on foot to obtain the necessary consents. I will of course treat this information for the present as strictly confidential. Yours sincerely,y * Iv Dexrd I 145 i FILE COP .

In informal conversa tion with Iraqi and Syrian officials here, we havp been assured that this is probably true* An Assyrian- American layman, present at the interview, put forward the suggestion that Lebanon might be an acceptable rendezvous, s hint that failed to secure any response from Mar ihiiaum himself. 6 # We therefore hive to report that we hive been unable to extract any satisfactory verbal answer from the Patriarch, who indeed asked for our proposals in writing. e have sent him a letter (copy attached) in whet we hope are sufficiently guarded term and have asked the Consul General at Chicago to do his best to secure an early reply. Yours ever, CHAHC&amp;RY n. ACOPY The Secretary of 3tate presents his compliments to His Excellency the British Ambassador and has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the latter’s J 7 , note (Refs 1357/2/46) of March 16 # 1946 and its enclosure regarding the case of His Holiness the tiar Shimun, the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church, a British subject who is presently residing at Chicago, Illinois. It appears that the Mar Shimun desires to arrange a meeting with the bishops of the Assyrian Church in order to discuss ecclesiastical affairs and to effect new consecrations. It appears further that the Government of India has agreed that this conference may be held somewhere in India, provided assurance can be given that no difficulties will be placed in the way of the return of the various ecclesiastics to their respective domiciles. The Ambassador is informed that an alien resident of the United States who is returning from a temporary visit in a foreign country may present in lieu of an immigration visa a permit to re-enter the United States issued, prior to his departure, by the competent authorities of the Department of Justice. If the Mar Shimun has been legally admitted into this country as a permanent resident thereof he would be eligible for the issuance of such a permit, application for which should be made by him to the Immigration and Naturalisation Service in the Franklin Trust Building at Philadelphia, Pa. On the other hand if the status of the Mar Shimun in the United states is a temporary one i.e. if he was admitted as a non-immigrant, it will be necessary for him to obtain an appropriate visa from an American consular officer in India before he may re-enter this country. It is regretted that it is not possible to giv any assurance, in advance of the personal appearance of the Mar Ehimun at a consular office in foreign territory, that such a visa may be issued to him. However, the Ambassador may rest assured that any visa application which may be made by the Mar Shimun will be accorded prompt and sympathetic attention, and every consideration consistei with existing inanigration laws and regulations.

I need not detail the past history of this matter, since 19UU, the Foreign office has made this grant in aid to the patriarchal family. Those who are concerned with their interests are greatly disturbed at this news and fear that at least some members of this distressful family may be left without any means of subsistance. It is particularly harsh if the payment has been stopped without warning and without explanation. No doubt the Foreign office obligation to them is unwelcome, but is it not still an obligation? yours sincerely, (Sg3*) Geoffrey cantuar. The Rt. non.

I transmit to Your Lordship herewith a copy of a / letter addressed to me in September last by His Holiness the Mar Chimun, the Patriarch of the Assyrians, now resident in Chicago, in which h£ requests permission for® meeting to take place as soon as possible between himself and the bishops of the Assyrian Church now residing in Iraq. He asserts that such a meeting would have to take place in Iraq or Syria. 2. I also enclose a copy of a telegram dated November last in which the Mar Shimun states that the Assyrian Church in India have urged him to pay them an immediate visit. 3. I understand that there are strong reasons, from the point of view of the welfare of the Assyrian Church, v/hy the Mar Shimun should if possible meet his bishops to discuss with them the affairs and organisation of the Church, to consecrate new bishops, and so forth. There is, of course, no reason why the Mar Shimun should not, if he so desires, approach the representatives in the United States of the Iraqi or Syrian Governments and apply to them for permission to enter Iraq or Syria; but there is good reason to suppose that neither the Iraqi nor the Syrian Governments would be inclined to allow him to enter their countries in present circumstances. Indeed, it would probably be undesirable from the point of view of the Assyrian communities that the Mar Shimun should visit them in Iraq or Syria at the present moment, and should the Iraqi and Syrian Governments be disinclined to allow the proposed visit, I would certainly not be disposed to try to induce them to alter their decision. 4. In these circumstances, it seemed that the bes place for a meeting between the Mar Shimun and his bishops would be somewhere in India, and the Government of Indid have therefore been approached to ascertain whether they would be prepared to allow the proposed meeting to taKe place in India. I enclose a copy of the Government of India’s reply dated 29th January from which you will see that they would agree to a visit from the Mar ahimun for a , strictly limited period, provided that they can have an assurance that, at the end of his visit, no dilficulties will be placed in the way of his return to his place ol origin. 5. I shall accordingly be grateful if you will now ascertain the position as regards the possibility of the Shimun, who is a British subject, being allowed to —^rfcttirn to the United States after his visit to India. If you,received satisfactory assurances on that score, you could arrange through His Majesty’s Consulate-General at ^cago for a suitable reply to be returned to the ^ ar Imun’s request, and for arrangements to be made for his OVforthcoming visit to India. His Majesty’s Consulate- General should in the first place ascertain from the Mar His Excellency The Right Honourable Earl of Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I. , etc., etc., etc., Washincrton.

The i^ar Fhlsun should be asked to bear these points in rind when conmunlcatlng with the representatives of the Assyrian Church in dyria, Irsq and India, and should be warned that he must not start making his own travelling arrangements until these preliminaries have been settled. 6 .

If it is desired to help the Patriarch in this matter, as the Foreign Office seem inclined to do, the suggestion that he might have his meeting in India seems quite a good one. I should hardly have thought that there was likely to be any political objection to this in India, but we should no doubt consult the Government of India before telling the Foreign Oft ice that they can go ahead.

As you will remember. Mar Shimun had to be removed from Iraq in 1933 owing to the part he played in the troubles of that year. We have some sympathy for his request to be allowed * to meet his bishops, but we doubt if the Iraqi or Syrian Governments will give him permission to enter their respective countries. The only other possible meeting places appear to be Palestine or India; we are doubtful if the Government of Palestine would welcome these visits in present circumstances. India, however, is reasonably accessible for the bishops from Iraq and Mar Shimun has himself been asked by his co-religionists there to visit them. If you felt able to agree that Mar Shiraun and his bishops snould hold their meeting in India, we should therefore like to reply to Mar Shimun hinting that India might be the most suitable place for his meeting.

His Holiness Eshai Mar Shimon xxiii r The Patriarchate, 6346 N.Sheridan Rd. Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. 12th September, 1945. Excellency 1945 Following the massacre of Assyrians in Iraq in August 1933, I was deported from that country without trial, and that remains my position to this day. During this period I have been completely cut off from my church and people in the middle East, and my repeated appeals to your predecessors for a short pastoral visit to the Assyrians on the river Khabur in Syria, in order to look $fter the affairs of the church have unfortunately gone unheeded; like wise the urgent appeals made by the Assyrians themselves to the British authorities and the late French mandatory power. In the meantime the situation of the church of the East in General and in Syria in particular, deprived of the Apostolic and Patriarchal personal supervision, which constitutes the basis of the Synodical law of the church, both spiritually and administratively, has been undergoing a steady deterioration. My constant pleas for a meeting with my bishops in order to discuss the most urgent affairs of the church have also been ignored. To day we are facing one of the gravest dangers in the long history of this ancient church, if not indeed, the gravest of all that we have experienced in tne past whether it be under the heathen or under the Mohemmeden rule; namely, the Parthian, the Sassanide dynasties, the Arab Khalif f s the Mogul Khans or the Ottoman Sultans. The Assyrian nation as a result of last world war and the events succeeding the massacre of 1933, has been scattered in many lands, both East and West. Our homes, our churches, our institutions of learning are all gone. More than half a dozen of the Episcopal Sees of the church have since been rendered vacant owing to the death or martyrdom of the occupants; the latest of these being the Metropolitan of India, who departed this life on the 30th April 1945. All these have to be filled and this cannot be done without the Patriarchs personal supervision and authority. We have moreover since lost about sixty percent of our priests, and their place remains vacant for lack of trained men. The remaining priesthood, the majority are old and feeble. Indeed, the extinction of this most ancient church in Christendom, the Aramaic speaking church founded by the holy Apostles themselves is nigh at hand, unless some measure of freedom is permitted us to practice our holy faith, in accordance with the dogmas and the law of the holy Catholic Apostolic Church of the East, namely, as assured and guaranteed under the terras of the now historic ’’Atlantic Charter”. The death of the Metropolitan in India has now presented us with one more grave and anxious problem. The church in India is appealing to me for a new Metropolitan, and for a personal visit to that far flung branch of the church of the East. In order to consecrate the new Metropolitan it is of utmost importance for me to meet with my brother bishops, for in accordance with the Canon Law of the Church of the East it is necessary to have three bishops to perform the consecration of another bishop. V His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bevin, His Majesty’s Secretary for Foreign Affairs, The Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.I would therefore request you to permit such a meeting 'between myself and my 'bishops who now reside in Iraq at the earliest possible, so that we may 'be able to discuss the general situation of the church and to take such measures as may be necessary for the future and to perform the consecration of the new Metropolitan. The situation already stated plus the financial problem, for we are a poor church, would not make such a meeting feasible except in the Middle East, that is, Iraq or Syria. I will therefore look forward with great eagerness to an early and favourable reply from Your Excellency.
