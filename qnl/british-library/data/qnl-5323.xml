Dated Simla, the 24th September, 1937, 1 am directed to address you regarding the examination for probationers of tne Indian Political Service laid dov^n in paragraph 8 of Appendix 12 to the Manual of Instructions to Officers of the Indian Political Service. 2. It is considered that the present syllabus for this examination is out of date and unnecessarily lengthy and that it is advisable not only to modernise it but also to simplify it. It is also considered ttr t the present system whereby this examination is conducted locally is unsatisfactory in that tne re can be no uniforrriity in the standard required to pass the examination. 3, It is proposed therefore as an experimental measure to hold this examination next year during the Secretariat training course at headquarters in May or June and that no local examinations should be held. All probationers attend ing the Secretariat course %ill be expected to prepare them selves for the departmental examination. A rrangements v^il] also be made for the examina tion of those probati one rs who for/^ 5 ■V for any reason do not attend the Secretariat course. 4. The books prescribed for the departmental examination to be held next year are:- (1) The introduction to Aitchison's Treaties, (Volume III for probationers on the Political side and volume XI for probationers on the External Affa irs side), -— (2) The Political Department Manual. ^3) The Government of India Act, 1935, read with Eddy and Lawton's summary. (Reference to the Act will be allowed in answering questions), (4) Barriedale Keith's Constitutional History of India. • I am tc ask tna t probationers sent to you should be informed on arrival of the books they are required to study. If tne se books are not available in your library, I am to request that they should be purchased for the use of probationers. 5 # The suitability of the books now chosen and of the proposed method of examination will again be reviewed in the light of the experience gained next year.

I have the honour to be Sir, -our nost ob dient servant, / (k for Tolitlcal Agent, Bahrain.dated the 26'^March, 1938. &gt; | .\V Wi 13 ycu please refer to your letter Nc, 41C, dated the 10th March, 1938, on the subject of Bird's Departmental iiix amine ti on? I propose, v.ith your approval, to write to the Govern ment of India suggesting- that a local examination should be held for Bird, as was done for Cotton. But before doin^ so' would like to point out that in the past local examinations have been held by the Political Resident himself in Bushire, the Probationer, if in Bahrain, coming over for a few days on duty. Last year Tomlinson managed to get up to Shiraz during the period. Is it your intention that the Examina tion should be held in Bahrain? 3. I have sent over copies of the two books asked for in the last paragraph of your letter, ?nd am going into ths question raised in x j aragraph numbered two. 4, I am writing this to save sending over a file.rvv J- 11 ■■—r- D.O# No. -1/35. The 30th Ma3?ch 1938. Please refer to your demi-official letter No # 543/64/79 dated the 25th March 1938. 2. It would really be better for Bird to be examined in Bahrain. He will presumably be entitled to have a part of the Political Agent's recess period, and will want to go to India then. I should not want him to be away for another week or two in Bushire solely for the purpose of taking his examination, if we could possibly arrange other wise; and of course it will be far less expensive to send the papers here and back to Bushire rather than sending Bird himself to Bushire. 3. If of course the local situation makes it impossible to let Bird get away to India on recess, then there will be less objection to his going over to Bushire for the examina tion and having a fortnight or so in Shlraz. But I do not think we need contemplate anything quite as bad as that.
