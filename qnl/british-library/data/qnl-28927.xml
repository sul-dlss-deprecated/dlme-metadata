It was therefore decided to occupy the permanent $ite as a temporary Cantonment* erecting to per ary hutting throughout* and converting to permanent structures at the rate of one tenth a year as soon as approval to permanent erection could be approved. 6, The foregoing course in addition to the large saving in rent for temporary occupation would it mm felt allow of sanitary and engineering works to be commenced as part of and in view of eventual permanent installations while also permitting private enterprise in Clubs and recreation to be undertaken on the same principles* It further ensured the energies of units being devoted to permanent benefit. ?, Ab regards the site selected* further examination d the (MA'mkJ&amp;I site elicited the facts ~ (a) That for some months of the year the river in flood mm several feet higher than the terreplain and that embankment must run twelve high at least, (hi That all amenities of life would be tinged with gloom of this circle of embankments.

The views which Iput forward to Sir George MacMunn which did not meet with his acceptance at the time were to the effect that we should not keep our Central - Garrison in this country at Baghdad but in the neighbour- -hood of Qizil Robat which has the following advantages:- (1) The Railway Junction for the Kurdistan Area. (2) Close proximity to the Persian Hills. (3) Good water supply,land costs nothing,fine gravel soil and minimum expenditure on roads. Proximity to area from which building stone and cement can be obtained. These views have,I believe,not found acceptance, but in the event of H.M f s Government calling upon this Office for an expression of opinion upon the subject, I should feel bound to put forward these views.Q 4048/10 General Head Quarters, Mes.

The Foreign Office (vide copies attached) have asked to be consulted as to any proposals which are on foot for the construction of the civil station. There is much to be said both for and against the introduction of the Indian system of European cantonment colony close to butfllitiut f During the War the value of dates cfLa good tree was from 10/- to £2.10.0. and the capital value of the average tree a^vM&gt; £5. The soil is good - it was in this neighbourhood that the cotton farm was established - and the site will, if not acquired, be much sought after for building purposes as well, fin the estimates quoted &lt;£44 per acre on t#e less cultivated and £78 per acre on the more cultivate sites do not seem excessive. 4.It was originally proposed that the State should reserve to itself the ri^it to acquire during the War and 6 months afterwards,land at the value it possessed at the time of occupation. But it is obviously unfair that the particular owner of an Estate desired by Government should suffer while his neighbours enjoy to the full the benefits of the increased rise in prices. The most recent Proclamation intended to prevent speculation in the land likely to be acquired by Government is dated April 1st 1919 but this secures to the Stat§ land at its genuine market value whettaw? this has demonstrably increased since the date of occupation. What is required in Mesopotamia is an enactment similar to the financial measures whereby the major portion of unearned increment in England goes to the State. This would be a^general application and no individual owner could complain; but it is a point of domestic economy which need not be raised with -the W.O. 5.There Terrains the question whether the Civil administration or the War Office should purchase the land. There seem to be two arguments; the future state of Mesopotamia is to be 'Arab” and it mi^it avoid (Flag A)1 £a.i^CX TKT.EriW FROn r T 7TT . coTn.’TPRTfmi?^.

Sir, .-V' &lt; &lt; ^ &gt; 8002 1919 December, 19X9. 4 ^ ' * I am commanded by the Army Council to send you the enclosed copies of a telegram of the 15th September and a letter of the 10th October, which they have received from the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, on the subject of the purchase of land at Baghdad. , Two maps (in original) are also enclosed which it is . requested may be returned with your reply. Vl ') The Council are not in possession of sufficient &amp; , data upon which to base any effective criticism of the estimated cost of purchasing this land, but the prices strike them as high. They would welcome any suggestions which Mr. Montagu may be able to offer on this or any other aspect of the proposal. As regards the statement that the price will rapidly increase, I am to enquire whether it is not possible for the Civil Administration to make arrangements to enable the occupying Power to acquire land without paying for the appreciation which results indirectly from the occupation. In any case it would appear to the Council unreasonable to pay any price which may have resulted from speculation in land values. I am to enquire what are the views of the Secretary of State with regard to the paragraph in the telegram which suggests thht the Civil Administration are prepared to accept the cost of this land as one of their liabilities. The idea appears to be that if purchase at the present time is, in the* opinion of the General Officer Commanding, in any $ case/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.case likely to Toe profitable, the land might he purchased forthwith by the Civil Administration, out of Civil Funds and held for future military or Civil requirements, or, if at a later date found not to be required, then sold at a profit.

Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, i 3 I 9 ~~ ymmu' Dated 10th October 1919. To:- The Secretary to the War Office, London. Sir, Reference your telegram Ho. 206S0 M.B. of 16th July 1919, I now have the honour to describe in detail the proposals which have been put before you from time to time by telegrams regarding the Cantonments in the vicinity of BAGHDAD. 2 . I would first explain that from BAGHDAD roads and railways, including the railroad to Persia, start in five different directions, while the navigation of both the Tigris and Euphrates can be controlled from its vicinity. That is to say, however much subsequent events may permit of the reduction of the Army of Occupation, so long as a British force remains in Mesopotamia so long will this Cantonment be the centre of the striking force. Lesser changes of policy therefore will not affect this Cantonment and more permanent works will always be justified. 3. The original conception as first put forward by Sir William Marshall pointed to a very large permanent Cantonment at CHALDARI a few miles North of BAGHDAD, to take some years in building while atemporary Cantonment of mud huts was erected elsewhere. examining the problem in more detail however, it was found that the hire of land for a temporary Cantonment would cost nearly as much as its acquisition, while it would be equally necessary to erect expensive water and sanitary works in a temporary Cantonment as in a permanent one. 5 . It was therefore decided to occupy the permanent site as a temporary Cantonment, erecting temporary hutting through out, and converting to permanent structures at the rate of one tenth a year as soon as approval to permanent erection could be approved. 6 . The foregoing course in addition to the large saving in rent for temporary occupation would it was felt allow of sanitary and engineering works to be commenced as part of and in view of eventual permanent installations while also permitting private enterprise in Clubs and recreation to be undertaken on the same principles. It further ensured the energies of units being devoted to permanent benefit. 7 . As regards the site selected, further examination of the CHALDARI site elicited the facts - (a) That for some months of the year the river in ' flood was several feet higher than the terreplein and that e&amp;bankment must run twelve high at least. (b) That all amenities of life would be tinged with gloom of this circle of embankments. That the cost of land would be considerable. That it was contemplated to place more troops here than in any other known Cantonment so that daily training would be almost impossible, and that the amenities of life much affected by dust and crowding.3. Two new sites were accordingly selected below BAGHDAD to be connected by a bridge of boats worked by Army Troops Bridging Train. ^^ ^ HINAIDI, where embanlonents to a much lesser degree already existed sufficiently to protect from flood and where land was very cheap. Available for a Cavalry Brigade, certain Army Troops and depots. Already in occupation is part of the Advanced Base. Good training ground near. 10 miles below Baghdad. (b) At DAURA opposite HINAIDI with four miles of river front facing the summer breeze. Good training ground, almost above high flood level, cheaper than CHALDARI 8 miles below BAGHDAD. A site far pleasanter and cooler than any others in vicinity. To accommod ate a Division less one Brigade, all schools and Central Ordnance and Supply depot. 9. The question of water supply was governed by the fact that over 100,000 Troops have drunk the filtered Tigris Water for 2 -g- years in this vicinity without injury, and that water could be brought from above KAZILMAIN (12 miles) above BAGHDAD and all its suburbs, or from the Diala (6 miles) at some future period. 10. The sites were found particularly healthy and free from malaria. 1 ] , These facts were communicated to you in the following telegrams:-Q.2535 of 5th June 1919 and Q 3208 of 28th July 1919- 12. In my telegram number Q, 495 of 14th September 1919, I informed you that the cost of DAURA about ten square mi^es would be at worst £500,000 and probably less, and at HIiTAIDI i £ 132,000 for about five square miles and I urged that these sites would cost far more in a year or so, as they can now be 5acquired under acquisition laws and also informed you that the- Civil authorities would themselves he owners if the Imperial Government would lend the money in the first instance* U. HINAIDI site is on the rail to the Persian line. Tne LAURA site is only 1^- miles from the main BASRAH - BAGHDAD line. 3 I would add that the Civil authorities have decided to make their official station between BAGHDAD and KIHAIDI and that it is intended to place the General Of ficer Commanding-'in*Chief * s Headquarters in the Civil Station* 1?* Work has been in progress since June on roads and irrigation cuts and brick-making, and troops will camp on these sites this Autumn. 16* As only £150*000 have been sanctioned for this work no hospitals have been undertaken at present. The main British hospital is in the Turkish Hospital at far extremity of BAGHDAD City, while the Indian hospital is in temporary huts* As soon as the future of Mesopotamia is settled it will be necessary to commence a combined Hospital at DAURA on modern lines to save several miles ferrying by steamer that now goes on. 17. Further provision will be necessary to move the Post Bellum Supply and Ordnance Depots, These at present are occupying expensive sites on the river bank 4 miles from the new Cantonment at DAURA, and must be moved from there as soon as the surplus Ordnance storesumiju,' n;ir I can be disposed of 5.
