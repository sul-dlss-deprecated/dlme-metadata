It also contains copies of a number of notices to airmen issued by the Iraqi Ministry of Communications and Works: see folios 5-8 and 11. One of these notices (see folio 11) is in both Arabic and English.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Francis Henry Humphrys), officials of the Foreign Office, and other officials at the British Embassy in Baghdad. The correspondence is periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in order to keep the India Office informed of developments; none of the correspondence in the file is directly addressed to the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Airports</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bagdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
