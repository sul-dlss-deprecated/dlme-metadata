The author was a Turkish physician who spent most of his working life in Cairo where he became ra’is al-aṭibbā’  (Chief of Physicians) and associated with the Bīmāristān Manṣūrī. In this treatise he speaks of the knowledge he gained working in hospitals and states that he herein reveals medical information formerly kept secret, as well as acknowledging his debt to his master, Jamāl al-Dīn known as Ibn al-Sūlkī. The copy was made by Ismā’īl ibn Turkī al-Manshalīlī and is undated, but the nature of the paper, ink, script and illumination suggests a date of the late fifteenth-century.", "collection": "Arabic Manuscripts and Maps", "record_created": "2018-08-01T13:00:00Z", "holding_institution": "Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford"}
