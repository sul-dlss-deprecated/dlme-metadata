To The Adviser, Bahrein Grovermaent, Bahrein, memorandum &gt; As you are av/are there is an ur ent need for the establishment of secondary industries in Bahrein, for the islands are at present entirely dependent for their welfare upon the success of the Pearling season. It would be of great advantage to the State if the boat or rather launch building industry in Bahrein were more fully developed, and the unique position of Bahrein and the fact that a Bahrein firm have the contract for the most popular variety of en^ne for almost the whole of the Gulf should be taken full advantage of. If the Customs duty on launch en ines were removed or rather a rebate of duty given if they were fitted into launches in Bahrein and full notice of this given to other ports in the Gulf, I believe the result would far out weigh the small loss of revenue that would ensuB, and the position of the State in cornering this infant industry much strengthened. I have discussed the matter with Messrs Khalil Kanoo and Mohamed Yateem, and they have undertaken to pass on to the public any concession that may be made in this I suggest therefore, that If His Excellency . ' respect. has no objection, this might be given effect to, and if the date of its takin ■ effect notified me I would ir/'' ^the British representatives at all the ports likely to 'be affected, who would in their turn give the action of the Bahrein (xovermient the widest possible publicity.] i f C Ho. ,2 4 3/ of 1348 Office of tj/e Adviser to the Governnrent, Bahrain.

In regard to the position of The American Mission as to a refund of Customs Duty paid 'by them, enclose herewith: 1. Copy of translation of a letter in Arabic H .E .The Deputy Ruler to The Revd G.J. Penning which it is inferred that the refund is to imported for hospital use. This is dat^d 1341, equivalent to 14th July 1923. ent b from i z for goods 29th D/Qaada 2. Copy of a letter dated 19th'Jul^ 1923, containing a translation of a letter from K.E. The Deputy Ruler to H.B.M's Political Agent. It will be noticed that the latter includes the phrase 'personal use of its members', which does not appear in the former letter. It is upon this phrase that The Revd G.J. Pennings bases the claim to a refund of all Customs Duty paid by members of The American Mission; and it is upon this authority that such refunds have previously been made. The point came up about a year ago when the Baladiah of Manamah granted a subsidy to The American Mission on account of the^r treatment of the poor. It would, I suggest, be well to knowwho are the members of the American Mission, exactly, in view of the expected arrival next month of a number of visitors for a conference, and does the phrase mean suchjriembers as are resident in Bahrein only, please ?

''ith reference to our conversation of yesterday's date, I have the honour to forward to you copies of the correspond ence available on my files in connection witn the claim of the American Mission to exemption from customs duties. Mr.Pennin^s opened the matter with his letter dated the 23rd June 1 ( J23. A rou^-h translation of this was forwarded to Shaikh Hamad with the Political Ajent T s letter dated the ^Jth July 1923. ^ 1? His Excellency replied in a letter dated the 29th Lhil Qaadh 1341,enclosing a letter for Lir.Pennin^s,the latter beinj sealed by him. A translation of this is enclosed as well as the original. This letter was apparently not sent to •ir.Fennings since it is present in original on my file but the letter No: 227/41/V.O dated the TJth July 1923 with its enclosure uwe apparently forwarded instead. Since there is nothing on my record to show that Shaikh Hamad had iamediatoly changed his mind after writing his letter of 29th D&amp;il .Qaadh 1341 nor that he had decided to admit all imports of the American Mission free and not simply those intended for the Hospital,! can only conclude that the trans lation forwarded with letter No:227/41/V.O was mistranslated and sent in error since it misinterprets Kis Excellency Shaikh Earned T s decision.'1' Government of Bahrain.

Dated, 16th, Safar, 1351 The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Persian Gkilf. 1 VS • .v ;• To Rev. G. J. Pennings, The American Mission, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to draw your attention to the subject of the exemption from Customs Duties which is at present enjoyed by the American Mission. I have recently examined the whole question of this remission and after reading the copies of the original correspondence, it appears to be quite clear that the concession granted by H. E, Shaikh Hamad to the Mission was intended only to apply to goods importe i for the hospital, not, as has been the practice, to all imports of the American Mission. A mistake seems to have been made originally in the translation of the letter from H. E. Shaikh Hamad, which was forwarded to you by the then Poli tical Agent, Major C. K. Daly. The letter written and signed by H. E. Shaikh Hamad, of which the actual copy•2— copy is filed in the Agency, clearly states that goods which are to be exempted are those which are imported for the use of the hospital. The actual letter was not, I think, sent to you, but a trans lation of it was sent and the meaning in the trans lation differs from the original in that it grants exenption on 'goods intended for the use of the ijaerican Mission**. I enclose for your information copies in English end Arabic of both these letters. It is not in any way implied that the American Mission has deliberately benefited from a concession to which they were not entitled to, but I am of the opinion that the intention of the concession was inadrertently given a different meaning through the translation of the letter which was sent to you. Under the circumstances from now onwards the exemp tion will be applied only to articles imported for the hospitals and for medical work in recognition of the public benefit which is conferred on the people of Bahrain by the yaluable medical work which is carried out by the Mission. I haye the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. Adviser \to the Government. Enclos.mKKm True Copy. Bahrain, Persian Gulf, June 21st, 1932. * . To The Financial Adviser to the Government ? Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, Bk iMWX 4f Yesterday v/e received your communication No. 181/3 with reference to the complete exemption from Customs duties, which we have till nov/ enjoyed. We recognise that in these times of financial distress every available sourse of revenue must be canvassed, and exemptions given in normal times are no longer as freely allowed, ^e recognise also that each member of the community should contribute his share. However, when we learn that we enjoyed this privilege, also as individuals, for the last ten years on account of a mistranslation of a letter from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, then we are mystified. Some nine years ago, as I remember, I had some correspondence with Major C. K. Daly about this matter. T 7e received from him a notice that our personal goods would no longer be exempted from Customs, and appended to his letter, there was, if I am not mistaken, a translation of the letter in Arabic, which you were kind enough to send me. as far as I remember in my reply, while not contesting his decision in any way, I expressed my surprise that a privilege which Shaikh Isa had accorded us for many years, should now be withdrawn by his son. Also, I think, I mentioned that we had been assured that the new regime would not mean any restrictions of our customs urivileges.-2- iH /ty* r '*J ^ * sA ^7 * Z&gt; e ^ ... ^ eytc^s ***^^ ^ c*rh. / ^ , ■ Shortly after that, on Jul/ 19t;h, 1923, I received a reply to ny letter of June 23rd. This reply and the attached translation o f a letter from Shaikh Horned I enclose for information. You will at once note that this translation is not of the letter of which you sen me a copy, but of some other letter which v ajor Jaly received afterwards. Our letter definitely says that goods for the ''personal use of the members'' are included, and concludes that this order v/as given 'in recognition of the good work done by the T lssion' ? I do know how Major Daly receivei this letter, but it is evident that he received it as -enuine, -nd as expressing the sentiments of Shaikh Hamad, for though 'ajor Daly did not easily reverse his decisions, m this case our customs privi leges, temporarily suspended, were at once restored. The date of Shaikh Hamad's letter, sent to us by L T ajor Daly, is not given, b ii t from the tone of the Major's letter to me, it alaost seems that the matter was referred to Shaikh Hamad, between the dates of Jun§ 23rd and July 19th, in which case our letter is the more recent, it would seem. This customs exemption ha been graciously granted us for many years by Shaikh Isa ^ and it did not seem stran -e to us at the time that his 5^ alv/ays friendly to us, should wish us to continue that courtesy. Certainly, therefore, as far as the information given us by Major Daly is concerned, the Customs officials were right in allowing us the refu .d, and we in accepting it. If a mistake creut in somewhere we regret it. But if financial stress forces him to withdraw a privilege, which he and his father before him, were pleased to extend so many years, we wish you would express to His Excellency3l1 INCORPORATING- STEPMEN LYNCH ».

In general practice the exemption has included the Clerks employed in the Agency Offices, and the Postoffice, also the Compounder attached to the Agency Surgeon. Itake the view that persons employed in the Agency, who are not salaried officials, such as Peons, household servants, etc., are not entitled to enjoy this privilege* Similarly a person not employed in the Agency staff, although employed by the Government of India would not be entitled. To avoid misunderstanding, might 1 therefore ask, please, if you would very kindly supply me with a list of the salaried officials employed by The Political Agency who would be entitled to -enjoy this concession, so that my Appraisers may know to whom they are entitled to release imports free of duty. it is of course understood that such imports would be reasonable in quantity and are not intended for sale.

I should be glad to be favoured with your views on this point; and possibly it may be thought advisable for a list of the staff to be lodged here in that connection. May I also point out that Customs Duty does not include the Import Yard charges, which are levied in respect of the handling and storage of goods; and I trust that you will concur with my view that in any case such imports are liable to Import Yard charges, please.7 fj- Uo. 3^3 - 3 of 1 352 Office of the Adviser to the ixovernment, Bahrain.

For many years gas cylinders have been imported from India, and re-exported to Bahrain filled with gas, and this business proceeds ragu ar y, not only by the local Upper Air Observers, but also by local merchants, and the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Except in the last case. Customs duty is collected only upon the cost of re-filling these cylinders and the expenses of transit etc., while Import Yard Charges are collscted upon them as packag s In the case of the Upper Air Observers, it is not proposed to Inw Customs duty upon the cylinders, but only upon the contents imported in such cylinders, pluTTfie usual Import Yard charges, similarly with importers. please.

In this letter it is agreed that articles and stores imported for use at the Naval Base and for use in H.LL Ships are exempt duty, but that imports for use of individual officers andjen in the ships are not so exempt. 3. It is not apparent to me why a different treatment should he accorded to articles addressed, say, to the Commanding Officer and those addressed to an individual. In neither case are they imported into Bahrain except in so far as they have to be ta^en from the Post Office or ^ail Steamer to the Naval Base for re-embarKing in ft.Vi. Ships. They could in fact, so far as freight arriving by Mail Steamer is concerned, be tal^en off by ship's boat direct to the Sloop and not enter Bahrain at all. 4.

I understand that in many Ports private goods addressed to officers and men of His Majesty's Ships receive the same treatment as service goods and that Customs duty is not levied on them, provided that it can be shown that the goods are, in fact, re-embarked in one of His Majesty's Ships. 3.

But as these parcels have always contained articles (such as balloons, stationery, instruments etc.) for the bona-fide use of the Pilot-balloon Observatory at Bahrain,(an office of a Department of Government of India), customs duty has never since the very inception of the observatory been charged on these parcels. If however a written permission is now necessary, I would re quest you to be so good as to issue one if it lies within your powers, or to let me know the authority to whom an application by this Depart ment should be made. Regarding veufliora.un list^^ti'i Miw^articles in the parcel recently ^iaet) imported I have asked the Meteorologist, Karachi Air Port, Drigji Road to let you have them^ as the parcel in question was sent by him.

Page 553 shows the exemptions granted to the Sultan of Muscat and Shaikhs o^ Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, who presumably receive their exemptions direct, as they do not keep representatives in India, in exchange for those they grant to our Political Agents and Staff. It is to be noted that whereas the Sultan of Muscat and family receive full exemptionr - the Shaikh of Bahrain only receives exemption for himself and his personal baggage when arriving in India. Therefore, we receive from Bahrain more than we give. There would seem to be two lines of action. l).To settle the matter direct between the Political Agent and the Director of Customs, Bahrain, on the lines that, (a)The Bahrain Customs Regulations do not definitely exclude families from exemption and, (b)that families have always been previously exempt and therefore there is no reason that they should not continue to be so, ''c)that the present decision appears to say the least of it rather arbitrary, as it was made without previously consulting the Political Agent, y d)that it seems to be against the spirit of the regulations, in that the officer who originally drafted them (Mr. Bower) always allowed exemption to families. Moreover, the Shaikh of Kuwait grants full exemption to the families of the Agency Staff in Kuwait. 3 2). To take up the matter on a broader basis, asking the Government of India to settle it in our favour, in which case, the Government of India would presumably have to be prepared to extend similar exemption to the Shaikh of Bahrain and family on all personal imports while in India and not only on arrival.
