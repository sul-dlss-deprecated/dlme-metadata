Beginning with her upbringing, graduate studies at Berkeley, and early career, she tells of how she came to AUC (as one of only two faculty in her department) and her first impressions of Cairo in 1963, during the last flooding of the Nile. She describes AUC ’s students (offering comparisons with later generations) and campus at the time, recalling playing tennis on its courts. She relates her experience of the 1967 war at AUC, including her evacuation from Egypt with other Americans as well as other major political events of that and later periods. Nelson outlines the development of anthropology at AUC and what eventually became the Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology and Egyptology Department, discussing its faculty members (including leading figures and the relationship between sociologists and anthropologists), expansion (as with the growth of the Psychology unit), and aspects of its academic program. Liberal arts initiatives (from the early Freshman Year Program to the later Core Curriculum) and research efforts like those of the Social Research Center and the interdisciplinary Basaisa village project are addressed, as well as challenges like government book censorship in the 1990s. Nelson’s role as the first Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences after the introduction of the schools structure at AUC is covered, along with the relationship between the faculty and administration on issues like compensation and governance. She discusses her own research, including her biography of Egyptian feminist Doria Shafik, and the emergence of the Institute for Gender and Women’s Studies. Nelson also expresses her misgivings about AUC’s upcoming move from downtown Cairo to the suburban new campus, and reflects on her integration into Egyptian life via close friends and family.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
