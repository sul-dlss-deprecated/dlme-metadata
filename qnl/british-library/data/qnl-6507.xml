G. P. Badger on the Pretensions of Persia in Beloochistan and Mekran, drawn up with especial reference to her Claim to Gwadur and Charhar. Submitted to Bombay Govern ment in Letter dated 3d June 1861. Whatever pretensions Persia may entertain to the possession of Beloochistan and Mekran, her actual jurisdiction in those provinces, as late as the year 1861, was almost exclusively confined to the interior. Major Goldsmid defined the Persian boundary in that territory, irrespective of the coast, as follows : — “ Draw a line from Kej to the north frontier of Beloochistan, and south-west ~ “ to Gwadur, and that would represent the country Mr/stewSMatedKur?a 0 &lt;!heri3th “ ^ etw e en ,?« rsi | a and Mekran, as far as we know ; April 1861. “ lor all chief places to the west of that line, such “ as Jalk, Kusserkund,&amp;c., are either paying tribute, “ or yield their revenue to Persia.” This approximate definition of the frontier line corresponds with the information which I obtained at Muscat from two Beloochee Chiefs, who were well acquainted with the country and politics of Beloochistan. According tp the statement of Meer Hussein, the Governor of Jashk on the part of the Sultan of Muscat, the Persians were then in possession ofBunpoor, Kusserkund, Nusserabad, and the whole of the territory to within a short distance of Kej, which latter place, he said, they might easily capture. The Beloochees had twice repulsed the invasion of the Persians within the last few years, but had finally succumbed, and were now obliged to pay tribute to the Shah, and to furnish men for the Persian army. Mullah Isa, the other Chief referred to, gave me the following details on the same subject:—Bunpoor and the district of Dizzuk were conquered by the Persians about twelve years ago. Bunpoor formerly belonged to the Naoori, a Belooch tribe, from whom it was taken by Mehrab Khan, the son of Agha Khan, now at Bombay. Some time after, Agha Khan removed Mehrab Khan, and placed Bunpoor under his younger son, Aboo’l Hasan Khan, who was Governor of the place when it was captured by the Persians, and in their hands it has remained ever since. The Persians were twice defeated in their attempts on Dizzuk, and, according to the latest accounts, they only held one fort there; but my informant was not certain whether they or the Beloochees were supreme in that district. The Belooch Chief of Dizzuk was Azzad Khan of Haran, of the Nashrawani tribe, and the name of the Persian Governor w as Alim Khan. Azzad Khan was represented as being at variance with Khododad Khan of Khelat, and in alliance with his father-in-law, Pohindul Khan of Candahar. It would appear from the foregoing, that the encroachments of Persia in Beloochistan began about fifteen years ago. Their conquests hitherto, however, with the solitary exception to be hereafter named, have been confined to the interior. With respect to the prevailing sovereignties on the coast of Mekran, I find that the result of my inquiries is confirmed gene- * Letter to the Secretary, Bombay rally by the official report of Mr. H.

It appears from these statements that Persia exercises no jurisdiction on the coast of Mekran, with the exception of the interval between Sudeij and Tez, a distance of 150 miles, or, according to Mr. Rassam, the country between Tank and Tez, a distance of about 60 miles. That district was seized by the Persians about 15 years ago, and its Chief, Meer Abdullah bm Murad Muhammed, now tributary to the Shah, is represented as being impatient to throw off his constrained allegiance^ ^ ^ R assam limits the coast territory farmed from Persia by the Sultan of Muscat to the country between Bunder Abbas and Gron, and places the interval between Koi Mubarek and Khor Roal, 20 miles to the westward of Tank, including the town of Jashk, under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. My own inquiries led me to infer that the farm extended along the coast from Bunder Abbas to Sudeij, and after consulting the last treaty between Persia and Muscat I am inclined to adhere to that conclusion; for Eiseen, (which I take to be the “ Je°-een ” of the maps, situated about 30 miles to the eastward of Jashk,) is expressly enumerated among the places made over, in farm, to the Sultan of Muscat. It is very probable, however, that the supremacy of Persia over the coast territory between Koi Mubarek and Sudeij (or Tank) was not conceded by the Sultan of Muscat till 1856, the date of the last treaty between the two powers. Perhaps it was their ignorance of the provisions of that treaty which led the Bunya and Nakhoda consulted by Major Goldsmid, to place the entire line of coast between Bunder Abbas and Charbar under the Sultan of Muscat; or, by saying that “ it belonged” to that ruler, they may have meant nothing more than that it was under his government. I note, moreover, that they wholly omit the territory of the Ameer 5 of the Bolaidi, who is undoubtedly at present tributary to Persia.Gwadel or Gwadur. The Bombay Government having submitted my original proposition for carrying the electric telegraph along the coast of Mekran to Major Henry Green, then Political Agent at Khelat, that officer, in his reply, raised the following question respecting the sovereignty of Gwadur:— “ Nusseer Khan, the great grandfather of the present Khan, about the middle of the last century, took possession of the country lying between longitude 60° and 66°, and latitude 25° to 30°, known as Kekran. He fixed his boundary as Gaih, about 120 miles west of the town of Kedj, the capital of Mekran. The port of the latter city, and, in fact, of the whole province, is Gwadur, which, as well as all other ports lying between it and Kurrachee, came into possession of the Belooch Chief, who, after placing his governors in the towns which he had conquered, returned to Kedj. Letter addressed to the Political Superintendent, Frontier, Upper Scinde, Camp Bagh, 27th March 1861. “ The country to the west of Gwadur as far as Cape Jask appears in those days to have been in possession of Sultan Syud [more correctly Seyyed Sultan] the Imaum of Muscat, and soon after the return of Nusseer Khan to Khelat, the inhabitants rebelled against the authority of the Imaum and threw off his allegiance. On this he despatched messengers and presents to the Khelat Chief requesting his assistance. The reply of the latter was that he could not furnish him with troops, but that he would give him the loan of the port of Gwadur, where he might land his troops and collect his stores, and that he might keep possession of it until he had brought his rebellious subjects to submission. This offer was accepted, and, on the above condition, the port was temporarily made over to the officers of the Imaum. “ Soon after the above occurrence, Nusseer Khan, the Belooch Chief, died, and his country fell into a state of anarchy, which has more or less continued, and of which the heirs of the Imaum, Sultan Syud [Seyyed Sultan] have taken advantage, and retained possession of Gwadur. The successors of Nusseer Khan have never, however, given up their claim to the port, and during the reign of the late Khan, Nusseer Khan, a force was despatched from Kedj, under the orders of the present Wuzeer, Wullee Mahomet, for the purpose of gaining possession of it. This was during the year 1857, but the Khan dying about this time, the expedition was abandoned, when the duty on which it had been despatched was nearly accomplished. “Since my stay in Beloochistan, His Highness the present Khan has frequently asked me to be allowed to direct his Governor of Kedj, Fukkeer Mahomet, to march against Gwadur and take possession; but I, being aware of the friendly alliance existing between the present Imaum and the British Government, have always declined to give my sanction. It is not, however, to be expected that His Highness will give up his claim to the port. “ I would therefore suggest that, to prevent delay in the event of the pro position of the Rev. Mr. Badger being carried out, and Gwadur, in all probability, becoming one of the principal stations on the coast, that negotiations be entered into by the British Government with the Imaum for the purchase of that port by the former, and that, under certain conditions, it be made over to His Highness the Khan of Khelat. I believe a very small sum would effect this object, and that having this coast line under an ally such as the Khan of Khelat would be of the greatest advantage, whether for political reasons, or for that under report.” Major Green’s letter having been submitted to me by the Bombay Government, I replied as follows on the foregoing subject:— “ I have made careful inquiry into the statement whereon it is said the present T , 0 ^ Khan of Khelat rests his claim to the town and JunXTi: P^T f XX V ' ' X ' a but I believe it to be wholly without foundation. I consider Seyyed Thoweynee’s plea that it was conquered by his grandfather, Seyyed Sultan, to be equally invalid. The most probable account of the manner in which Gwadur fell into the hands of Seyyed Sultan was given me by an old Belooch Chief at Muscat, whose relatives have been in the service of the Imaum for several generations, and whose narrative of facts I found to correspond generally with the native chronicles of those times. He states that Seyyed Sultan, the fifth but the bravest son of Imaum Ahmed, the first of the reigning A 24 Muscat dynasty, having rebelled against his father,’ repaired to the Khan of Khelat and sought his aid in dethroning him. The Khan, wishing to have a friendly power possessed of a naval force to protect his coast, and foreseeing that Sultan would eventually succeed to the Muscat sovereignty, so far volunteered his assistance as to give him, in perpetuity, the town and fort of Gwadur, the only attached condition being that he should always defend the place against the enemies of Khelat. Considering the unimportance of Gwadur at the time, and the Khan’s inability, from want of ships, to guard it from attack, there is no improbability in this story, and several of the facts on which it is founded are corroborated by contemporary Arabian historians. It will, doubtless, be easy for the present Khan to dispute this statement, or to set aside the prescriptive right of undisputed posses sion by the successive rulers of Muscat for upwards of a century, and he may further deem himself justified in establishing his claim by force ; but I am at a loss to perceive how such success would benefit him permanently, or prove of any advantage to the furtherance of the telegraph scheme. Seyyed Thoweynee would certainly oppose any attempt of the kind, and, although it is probable that he would be unable to resist a determined land attack by the Khan’s army, one of his ships of war would suffice to blockade the port, and to cut off all communication with the sea, thereby stopping effectually all trade, and doing serious injury to the Khan’s inland territories. “ On the whole, therefore, it appears to me that the influence of our Agent at Khelat would be best used in dissuading the Khan from any such enterprise. His abstinence therefrom will prevent complications most detrimental to the growing trade of those parts, will entail on himself no damage, and will leave him and us with a friendly ally at Gwadur, whose good offices may be relied on in any matter wherein British interests are concerned. I found that Seyyed Thoweynee was well aware of the attack which the Khan meditated against Gwadur in 1857, and he seemed to know, moreover, that that Chief had not relinquished the idea of seizing it. But the Khan is represented as hesitating to carry out his purpose, owing to the urgent expostulations of his kinsman the Jam of Beyla, who is reported to have frequently dissuaded him from the undertaking, on the ground that it would be a violation of the promise made by his grandfather to Seyyed Sultan. I have been also assured that the Beloochees at Gwadur are quite satisfied with the Muscat rule ; for Seyyed Thoweynee levies no taxes from them, and with a view of feeling themselves more safe from an attack by the Khan, they have urged His Highness to build a wall round the town, and he has promised to accede to the request as soon as possible.” I find, on referring to the Arabic chronicles of the time, that the dispute between Imaum Ahmed, the Sovereign of Muscat, and his two sons, Sultan and Seif, commenced about the year 1760, and continued, with occasional intervals of reconciliation, until the death of their father in 1774. If, as is averred, Gwadur was made over to Seyyed Sultan at that period, the place has been a dependency of Muscat for about a century. Seyyed Sultan succeeded his brother in 1797, and in the course of the following year took Charbar on the coast of Mekran, and the islands of Hormuz and Kishm in the Persian Gulf. I note, under this head, that the question raised respecting the sovereignty of Gwadur has reference solely to the alleged claims of the Khan of Khelat, and that the idea of Persia having a right to the place has never, to my knowledge, been dreamt of by any of the Native States, unless it be by the Persians themselves. With regard to Major Green’s proposition respecting the disposal of Gwadur, Major Goldsmid remarks:—“ Kindly look at the Letter to Mr. Stewart, Kurrachee, u argument in re Gwadur, paras. 5 to 7 of Major 13th Apn 1861. u Green’s letter, and again in para. 8. It seems to “ me that a Khelat view of the case has been taken in fixing the nature of the “ tenure, and an illogical view with reference to future adjustment. “ If, indeed, Gwadur be wrongfully held by the Imaum, why are we to admit his right and purchase the place at all ? And for what? For Khelat, whose right we declare it to be. “ I was speaking to Agha Mohammed Bakir, Agha Khan’s brother, on the subject a few mornings ago. ... He says the revenues of Gwadur are the Imaum’s, and suggests, that if Government want the use of the port as a telegraph station, or for any other purpose, they have only to offer the Imaum some 3,000 dollars a year, and he would be delighted to give it up. Gwadur Bunder, as a British port, would, he says, realize more than treble the sum.”5 Dated 20 th April 1861. The following Resolution was passed by the Honour able Roard, Bombay, on the foregoing subject:— “ An important question is raised by the Political Agent of Khelat in the present correspondence, and one which, unless skilfully and delicately treated will probably lead to complications most detrimental to the success of the proposed line of telegraph along the Mekran coast. r “It is admitted by Major Green, that the Imaum of Muscat was in possession of the country to the west of Gwadur, as far as Cape Jask, at the period (viz., the middle of the last century) when the Khan of Khelat conquered the country lying between Gwadur and Kurrachee. It is also admitted that the rulers of Muscat have been in undisturbed possession of Gwadur from nearly the same period, fully a century ago, and it is, therefore, obvious that their title, whether valid or other wise originally, derives a prescriptive right from mere lapse of time. Under these circumstances, the expediency of entering into the negotiations proposed by Major Green, with reference to Gwadur, may be questioned.” This is sound reasoning, and, as far as British interests in that quarter are concerned, it is far more desirable that the port of Gwadur should remain in the hands of the Sultan of Muscat, who has a naval force to protect it, than that it should be annexed to the territories of the Khan of Khelat, who would be unable to defend it against the aggressions of Persia. Persia in its Political Relations with the Muscat State. It has been stated above, on the authority of authentic Arabian records, that Seyyed Sultan captured Charbar on the coast of Mekran, and also the islands of Hormuz and Kishm about the year 1798. At that period the former place appears to have been in the possession of the Beloochees, and the two Gulf islands in the hands of the Arab tribe of Maan. Kishm was undoubtedly independent at the time, but I am not so sure about the island of Hormuz, which had been taken from the Portuguese, aided by a British force, in 1622. It seems highly probable however, that when the commerce of the island had been removed by the Shah to the new town of Gombroon, named after himself “ Bunder Abbas,” that Hormuz was abandoned by the Persians, and the Arabs allowed to do much as they pleased there, though it is not likely that the Persians ever relinquished their right to its possession. Be this as it may, it is certain that Seyyed Sultan, then Sultan of Muscat, captured the island of Hormuz in the year 1798. It was in this same year that Seyyed Sultan entered into a treaty with the British, the 7th Article of which stipulates as follows :—“ In the port of Bunder Dated 12th October 1798. See “ ShaU Bombay Government Selections, l? 6 dl 5P 0Sed to establish a factory, making it as a Persian Gulf. “ tort, I have no objection to their fortifying the “ same, and mounting guns thereon, as many as “ ^ey list, and to forty or fifty English gentlemen residing there, with seven or eight hundred English sepoys, &amp;c. About this period, moreover, permission appears to have been accorded by Seyyed Sultan for the establishment of a British naval station at Bassadore, on the island of Kishm, which has existed there, with the sanction of the successive rulers of Muscat, up to the present day. No mention is made of the island of Hormuz in the treaty above quoted, and although it is not pretended that Seyyed Sultan exercised absolute sovereignty oyer Bunder Abbas, nevertheless it is clear, from the foregoing concessions on his part, that, even in that place, his authority was almost supreme. I am not certain on what tenure Seyyed Sultan held Bunder Abbas from the Persians, neither can I state positively what places were included in the territory farmed from Persia by his successor, Seyyed Saeed, the late Sultan of Muscat • but my impression is that they were confined to the mainland, and that the island of Hormuz was not comprised in the farm. I think it highly probable that the coast between Bunder Abbas and Gron comprehended the whole and sole territory over which Seyyed Saeed recognized the sovereignty of Persia, by taking it from that power on farm. The annual price fixed for the said farm*was 6 000 tomans. ’ In the year 1855, a serious dispute arose between Seyyed Saeed, the late Sultan of Muscat, and the Persians, which led to active hostilities on both sides A36 At the outset, the latter succeeded in driving the Muscatees from Bunder Abbas and Minau, but those places were subsequently recaptured by the Sultan s torces. Eventually, however, the Persians got the upper hand, owing to the non-arrival of Sewed Saeed’s Arab allies from the opposite coast, whose departure to his assistance is alleged to have been forbidden, under threats of summary chastise ment by Captain Jones, then British Resident at Bushire. In consequence of this failure, Seyved Saeed was obliged to make the best terms he could wit Persia, and a new treaty was drawn up between the two Powers regulating their future mutual relations. 11 ht i\/r Seyyed Saeed appears to have complained to the Honourable Mr. Murray, then British Minister at Teheran, of the unfair conditions which had been exacted from him by Persia. These grievances having been laid before Her Majesty s Home Government, the late Sir James Outram, then in command of the Persian Expedition, was directed to inquire into the subject with a view to British inter vention, in behalf of the peace and tranquillity of the Persian Gulf through the medium of any new treaty which might be concluded between Her Majesty s Government and the Shah of Persia. . . , . , ,. Sir James Outram’s first report on the subject is contained in a letter addressed to Lord Clarendon, dated 2d of March 1857. He writes The argu ments set forth by Mr. Murray in his Despatch of the 18th of August 1856, m behalf of the Imaum of Muscat’s continued occupancy of Bunder Abbas, deserve the most serious attention in connection with the political and commercial interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. The condition, comprised under this para graph was evidently framed with a view to secure those advantages, as well as to support our ally the Imaum; but the stipulation is couched in general terms and your Lordship will perceive, from the following remarks, that it will be a dehcate matter to arbitrate between the two parties with a due appreciation of the claims ° f ea ?Mr. Murray, in his Despatch above cited, speaks of our ‘ having recognized &lt; Imaum’s rights and claims for half a century, and of the Indian Governments, ‘ in former days, having contracted a treaty with him, in which Bunder Abbas is &lt; distinctly named as being in his dominions like Muscat itself.’ I have examined the treaty here referred to, which I apprehend to be that under date 12th October 1798 and I confess to not feeling justified in drawing such a conclusion from the vague manner in which Bunder Abbas is spoken of as ( a port of the Sirkar (meaning the Imaum), and.from the permission accorded to the English to establish and fortify a factory there. , . . , a your Lordship’s statement of the Iraaum’s tenure of the place, as conveyed in your Lordship’s Despatch to Lord Wodehouse, dated 30th December last, namely that he has rented it from the Persian Government for a long series of years appears to be the correct state of the case, and accords with the information conveyed in the annexed letter from Captain Jones, Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Mr Secretary Anderson, Bombay, dated 27th August 1856. From that docu ment it would appear that a stipulation has been entered into by the Imaum with the Persian Government, whereby the former now farms the fort of Bunder Abbas and the adjacent islands of Kishm and Hormuz for a fixed rental of 16,000 tomans per annum, besides other payments in the shape of largess and douceur; but whether the contract is binding on both parties for one or more years, whether the condition is expressed or not that it shall be renewed on the same terms or on any other, or whether it comprises a lease for a number of years, is not plain, and I have hitherto failed to obtain any conclusive information on the subject. The annexed copy of a letter from the Imaum to Mr. Murray corroborates that part of Captain Jones’s despatch above quoted, which reports His Highness’s dissatisfaction with the terms of the compact. On the other hand, an impression appears to prevail that the Imaum is pleased with his late bargain.” F All Sir James Outram’s endeavours to obtain a copy of the treaty referred to were unsuccessful, and Captain Jones either could not or would not aid him in the matter The truth is, that that Officer’s proceedings, during the hostilities between Persia and the Sultan of Muscat in 1855-56, were very questionable, gidino- as he appears to have done, on his own authority, with the former against the latter Moreover, it was Captain Jones himself who gave Sir James Outram to understand that Seyyed Saeed was, in reality, pleased with the conditions of his late treaty with Persia, though he pretended that he had been grossly imposed on.7 At a subsequent date, and after consulting with Captain (now Colonel) Kemball, Sir James Outram inserted the following remarks, under Article YIIL of his draft of a proposed treaty between Great Britain and Persia:—“ The same “ reason, viz., the want of adequate information on the terms of the agreement “ last made between the Persian Government and the late Imaum of Muscat “ [Seyyed Saeed had died in the interval] which prevented me from framing any “ specific condition in behalf of the latter in my Despatch to your Lordship of “ the 2d March, still precludes me from filling up this Article. No communication “ has yet reached me in reply to the inquiries which I have directed to be made “ in the matter in question. I have been given to understand, however, that the “ statement made by Captain Jones, in a letter to Mr. Secretary Anderson, “ Bombay, and appended to my despatch above quoted, is liable to serious “ misapprehension. Captain Jones, after mentioning what he had learnt to be “ the annual rent now fixed for Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, adds, with “ respect to the latter, 4 which now include Kishm and Hormuz, not before “ ‘ acknowledged on the part of Persia.’ ” [The meaning of this somewhat obscure passage is intended to convey the idea that Persia, by making over those said islands to the Sultan of Muscat had conferred a favour upon that prince.] “ Captain Kemball, however, the late Resident at Bushire, speaking under cor- “ rection, informs me that Kishm and Hormuz have long been acknowledged as “ integral parts of the Imaum’s dominions, and that, in virtue of his sovereignty “ over those islands, he permits us to occupy Bassadore. He is further of opinion “ that, by the word ‘ dependencies,’ Minau and some other places on the mainland “ are meant.” I think there is good reason to infer from the foregoing review of the past relations between Persia and Muscat, that, up to the date of the last treaty between the two states, Kishm was a dependency of Muscat, and that, if Persia entertained any claim to Hormuz, it was not formally recognized by the Muscat Sultan, in whose possession the island appears to have remained since its conquest by Seyyed Sultan in 1798. The position of Muscat, however, in the Persian Gulf was seriously affected by the conditions of the Treaty of 1856. A copy of that document was handed to me by Seyyed Thoweynee, the present Sultan, while employed on the Muscat- Zanzibar Commission, together with a strong protest against the part which Captain Jones is alleged to have taken in preventing Seyyed Saeed’s Arab auxiliaries from joining him at Bunder Abbas, the want of which reinforcements obliged him to conclude an ignominious peace with the Persians, and to resign to them the sovereignty of part of his territories. The following is an abstract of the stipulations of this Treaty, a copy of which translated from an Arabic version, furnished me by Seyyed Thoweynee, is appended:— Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, also the two maritime islands \ix. Kishm and Hormuz], together with Eiseen, Tazian, Shemeel, Minau, and Biyaban, are declared to be places belonging to the Supreme [Persian] Government, over which the Imaum of Muscat may appoint iVrab deputies for the space of twenty years. The governor deputed by him over Bunder Abbas shall render obedience to the Governor of Shiraz. The rental of these places, including certain fixed gratuities, to be 16,000 tomauns. f The ditch round Bunder Abbas to be filled up, and no other is to be dug there. At the expiration of twenty years, these territories are to be restored to Persia, with which power it will rest to decide whether the farm shall be continued to the Sultan of Muscat or not. “ Should the Governors of Ears, or the Governors of Kirman, on any im portant occasion, wish to despatch troops towards Cutch, or Mekran, or Beloo- chistan, they shall be treated with the respect due to governors, and shall be supplied with provisions, guides, and escorts.” In case the Governor of Shiraz should complain against the Arab Governor of Bunder Abbas, the Imaum shall immediately remove him, and appoint another in his place, who shall likewise be subject to the Governor of Shiraz. Bunder Abbas, the adjacent islands, and the other places named, are consigned in farm to the Sultan of Muscat and his heirs only. In default of such, these territories must revert to the Persian Minister of State. A 48 While the territories above named shall remain in the hands of the Sultan of Muscat’s officers, he shall not allow the agents of any foreign Governments to pass through those places, and shall protect them, by ships of war and otherwise, against secret treachery and open foreign invasion. The Sultan of Muscat has not the right of transferring Bunder Abbas, or any of the afore-named territories, to any foreign power, even under the conditions stipulated. This Treaty was undoubtedly accepted for himself and his successors by the late Sultan of Muscat, and its stipulations clearly define the territory which Persia may now legitimately claim, either in virtue of prior possession or by right of conquest. That territory (if I am not mistaken in identifying “ Eiseen ” mentioned in the Treaty with the “ Jegeen ” of the maps) comprises, besides the two islands of Kishm and Hormuz, the maritime provinces lying between Bunder Abbas and Sudeij ; but the Persian boundary on the coast, as explained in a preceding paragraph, extends between 60 and 150 miles to the eastward of the latter place, the intermediate territory having been captured from the Belooch Ameer of the Bolaidi about fifteen years ago, or eight years before the date of the last treaty between Persia and Muscat. There is not a tittle of evidence to prove that Persia has any right of sovereignty on the coast of Mekran to the eastward of this boundary, and if she is now advancing any claims in that direction, it is nothing more than what might have been expected as a sequel to her recent triumph over Muscat, and her successful encroachments in Beloochistan. As to Charbar and Gwadur, it deserves special notice that those places are not even alluded to in the last treaty between Persia and the late Sultan of Muscat. A clear proof that at that time Persia entertained no pretensions to supremacy over them. In conclusion, I quote the following remarks which I ventured to submit to the Government of Bombay on this subject:—“ Viewed ment^ombart^d^th 0 jZe' ’ n “““‘ion with the advance of the Persian army 1861. • towards the eastward of Kirman, the stipulation contained in Article IX. of the Treaty under notice, is suggestive of further meditated encroachment in that direction. That Article distinctly provides for the passage of troops through Bunder Abbas to Mekran, Beloochistan, and even Cutch [Gundava], that is, in a line towards the Indus, which may eventually be found more practicable than any more northern route. The Persians have already reduced the Ameer of the Bolaidi, whose territories extend about 60 miles along the coast, and placed the province of Geh under tribute. According to credible information collected at Muscat they have also advanced from Bunpoor and occupied Serbaz, completely routing the Beloochees. To the south, they are reported to be in force as far as Nusseerabad, having subjugated all the country to the westward, and to be meditating an attack on Kej, the capital of the Khan of Khelat’s Mekran territories ; while, in the north, they have very lately retaken the district of Dizzuk from Azzad Khan, the firm ally of the Dost, and are acting in concert with the Jam of Herat and Afzul Khan, who are said to be marching in force on Candahar. “ Whilst hesitating to attach any serious or immediate political consequence, as regards British interests in the East, to these encroachments of Persia in Central Asia, I nevertheless deem the subject of sufficient importance to evoke the diligence of Her Majesty’s Government. And, as regards the proceedings of the same power in the Persian Gulf, I respectfully submit that they supply a strong motive for the adoption on our part of a vigorous and discreet policy, such as may tend to conciliate the maritime Arab tribes in that quarter, and confirm them in their attachment to the British Government.” The annexed outline map, which has no claim to perfect accuracy, may nevertheless be found useful in illustrating the political geography discussed in the foregoing remarks.

(Signed) George Percy Badger.Report by Colonel Goldsmid on the ^laims of Persia, Khelat, and Muscat, to Sovereign Rights on the Mekran Coast. Political Department. From Lieutenant-Colonel F. J. Goldsmid, on special duty, to W. H. Havelock, Esquire, Officiating Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, In obedience to the orders of His Excellency the Governor in Council, communicated in your No. 3986, of the 11th instant (received 12th idem), I have the honour to report perusal of such proceedings on record in the Political Department relating to the Establishment of the Telegraph on the Mekran Coast, as appeared necessary to enable me to prepare a detailed statement on the respective claims to Sovereign rights in Mekran. My instructions are to show “ according to the best information available, how far the claims of Persia, Khelat, “ or Muscat, or any other State, to any Sovereign right in any town or district “ in Mekran, are founded on treaty, or possession, or acknowledgment by the local “ rulers.” 2. It will, perhaps, be well to consider briefly, in the first instance, “ what are “ the exact geographical definitions of Mekran,” and “ what do we learn of its past “ and present history to account for its divided and uncertain possession ?” Brief History of Khelat by Major Leech, in Asiatic Society’s Journal, 1843. 3. In the chronicles of the conquest of Sind at the early part of the eighth r century, mention is made of this country as lying eograp y . i n the route of the invading army marching from 71 ' the land of the Caliphs. In A.D. 1154, Al-Edrisi calls it by its modern name without the variation of a single letter; and a century later, Marco Polo speaks of “ Res Macoran, a great kingdom of idolaters and Saracens.” That the modern word “ Mekran ” is not found in the Greek or Latin writers who treat of the locality, is explained by the assumption that it is a corruption of its ancient designation, or an oriental name of doubtful origin. From the 16th century, and after the Portuguese established their authority in the Persian Gulf, not only do we find more frequent mention of Mekran itself, but some of its towns or villages appear under their modern names. But all such information is confused. The maps, up to those of the present century, are not reliable, though several* show the particular track required; and no satisfactory account of the country is really recorded before the publication of Sir Henry Pottinger’s travels in 1816. At this period it was no longer a part of the Persian dominions defined by our older travellers and geographers, but part of “ Beloochistan,” classed in the second division of that short-lived but once powerful State. Pottinger, in addition to other full and particular description, gives it at least intelligible sub-divisions, to the general correctness of which Major Henry Green’s more recent experience bears testimony. Without asserting that these have undergone no change, or that there may not be one or two more or less, I will, in default of other data, make them the basis of detailed inquiry. * Sanson, A.D. - De Lisle - Do. - De Mamepas - 1679. 1701 . 1724. 1740, &amp;c., &amp;c. 4. In page 100 of the “ History of Beloochistan ” we are told, “ the principal £&lt; inland districts of Mekran are Kedge, Punjgoor, Much, Dizuk, Kusserkund, “ Bushkurd, Sibb, Jalk, Kalpoorakan, and Kohuk ; and on the sea coast there are “ those of Urboo, Koolaj, Choubar, Teez, and Gwak.” Now, with the exception of Punjgoor, Kedge, Urboo, Koolaj, and Much, all the above are on the western side of the country described. The most northerly districts are those of Dizuk, Sibb, and Jalk. “ Urboo ” is believed to be the district of which Cape Arabah or 4887. C* * 12 Ormara is the prominent feature, for the name itself did not seem familiar to the inhabitants at the time of my late visit.—( Vide Appendix A.) 5.

The sea front may be even more clearly defined as the country west of the Malan clifts up to Chedar, or between 65 and 59 degrees of longitude This as nearly as possible, is believed to illustrate modern Mekran, part if not* the whole of the ancient Eastern Carmania, or the “ Carmania altera” of Ptolemv —(Appendix B.) ^ 7. As regards present possession, out of the 15 provinces enumerated by Pottinger, the best evidence procurable gives only five* to the Khelat State—one, i.e., Choubar, to the Imaum of Muscat, and the remaining nine to Persia, as immediate tributaries or subject to demands for tribute. And of those marginally noted the Khan derives no revenue from Urboo whatever, as it has been ceded for many years by f Vide Appendix C. the Khelat Chiefs to their nominal vassals the Jams . , , . 0 ^ Uela/f* But, as above stated, I cannot speak with confidence on the precise subdivision into districts. The matter is of no great importance in its general bearing on the question under report and could readily be solved by either Colonel Henry Green or the Resident at S. I will now proceed to discuss the rights of Persia to those portions of Eastern Mekran to which she has laid, and continues to lay her claim. ‘ And first without reference to the Imaum of Muscat, whose hold of Gwadur is rather opposed by the Khan of Khelat than the Shah. It is shown on good autho rity, that Jalk, Bizuk, and Sibb are not only subject to occupation by Persian troops, but that in 1856-57 they were so occupied from the neighbouring pro vince of Seistan. In February 1860, Major Henry Green reported a similar occupation of Kusserkund 1 he town of Gaik, by some called the capital, by the late Captain Grant the “second city in Mekran’’ r . .■ # and ^e head quarters of Mir Abdoola Gitehki hn« been also reported as Persian.

Appendix to Kinnier’s Memoir of Persian Empire, 1813.13 10. If possession for a period of years must necessarily imply “acknowledg ment by the local rulers,” it is the acknowledgment of helplessness. I do not for &amp; a moment believe that the Persian yoke is acceptable to the Sirdars of Mekran, west of Khelat. A petition was presented to me, when at Gwadur in February last y y ear &gt; ^ 0I P one ^h 0 neighbouring Chiefs, and others had been forwarded to the Commissioner at Kurrachee before my departure from that place, praying generally for British interference against the tyranny of the “ Gujjurs” collecting the revenue. None of these could be noticed at the time, and that addressed to myself was, if I rightly remember, returned to the bearer unread so soon as its purport was ascertained. 11. And yet, if we acknowledge the right of prior conquest, in the wide sense of the word, whether for Nadir Shah on behalf of Persia, Ahmed Shah of Candahar, or Nussir Khan of Beloochistan, it is not clear how exception can be taken to any description of past territorial aggression and encroachment by the same, or any of the same powers involving no stronger claim upon our interference than direct and open warfare. ^ Moreover, the results with which we have to do are those of a state of things in which we could not legitimately have exercised interference at any time. At the present moment the case is different. Khelat is our close ally. Though not bound by existing treaty to protect her frontier by * tv tv r™ , , force, we have treated* with her, as an independent aren“^“r£K State - t° P™tect our Telegraph up to a certain the British Government. point within her limits, and there is now a legitimate opening for taking exception at anv unauthorized aggression from without, upon such boundary line. Our case, it is deferentially submitted, wants but a ratified agreement between the powers concerned, to make remonstrance not only legal but compulsory. * This is not very clear, but the conclusion is that the line included all Mekran. f Appendix D. 12. In an interesting paper on Khelat affairs, prepared by the son of the late Submitted to Government. ^ i ; 0 . gha G ' 1 Mahomed, and translated by Captain Dickinson about two years ago, I find it mentioned that a special Envoy from the Shah of Persia had come to Nussir Khan of Khelat to settle a question of the western boundary of that province. It was then repre sented that Persia had no claims to Kedje and Mekran, but to Minab, which having been captured by the Khan would have to be abandoned. The boundary was then defined to be from Kedje to Chidar* on the sea coast. It is also asserted that there is a well at Chidar Mullik with the inscription recording the limits. From other evidencef on this point, I fear that the inscription, if found at all, will only mark the boundary of Mekran, without reference to the rights of this or that Sovereign. At the same time it is just possible there may be some record on the subject in the Khelat Dufter. Of treaties I am not sanguine that any exist, nor do I feel warranted in delaying this report to communicate with those Officers who are either already acquainted, or could readily become acquainted with the subject. 13. Though not called upon to pass any opinions on the disposal of the Durbars were held in my tent, the most fervent assurances of assistance ■ - to the Telegraph Officers were made, and all that occurred to me as wanting to secure a satisfactory arrangement was a well-defined western boundary of the Ivhelat State, such as now acknowledged to be under the independent control of His Highness Khoda Dad Khan ; the boundary, in fact, of western Mekran. This boundary, so far as the question has become intelligible to me in its detail, is very nearly defined by the tract of country called the Dusht, and the river known as Dusht Khor, which may be said now to mark the south westerly independent possessions of the Khan of Khelat in Kedge. A line drawn from the northern frontier, east of Jalk, Sibb, Kussarkundi, and such districts as have, to all intents and purposes, fairly thrown off the Khan’s authority to the seaboard, east of Gwadur, would not only secure to our ally the hitherto unknown advantages of a recognized frontier, but it would more over give that security to our own telegraphic scheme, which the existing status does not promise. In a general political sense the matter is one of the greatest moment. question, I would most respectfully submit to the notice of His Excellency the Governor in Council that the occurrences of the two last years have greatly strengthen ed the arguments used in paragraphs 101 and 102 of mv printed Report on the route from Kur rachee to Gwadur, dated 22d February 1862, and not the least forcible of all the arguments adducible in pressing this point would be the expressed wish of the C 214 Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on discussing the Herat question :—The of principal “ object we have in view in those discus- “ sions is the security of our frontier in Khorasan, “ Kirman, Beloochistan and Seistan.” With the Minister in such humour, no time would seem better adapted to treat with him on the Mekran boundary, and we might honestly respond to the above general invitation by confining our attention * to the points on which we ourselves are especially interested. I hope to he acquitted of presumption in making even allusion to a point of Foreign Office diplomacy, but the terra incognita of Beloochistan, however unimportant in a map of the world, becomes full of life and meaning when viewed from Western India. 14.

His interpretation of the status of Khelat should be that of his Government, for he must in this respect, if in no other, have had his instructions. He may he said indeed to admit that the Khan is the Sovereign of an independent State extending westward to Gwadur, and such view is opposed to the notion that Persia . Mimster for Foreign ] a y g c i a j m t; 0 the whole coast line from Bunder November 1861. Abbass to the frontiers ot Sind, t.e., Kurrachee. On the 6th April last this person sent a messenger to the Khan of Khelat with a letter complaining of Azad Khan, Chief of Khuran. His letter, whatever its hidden purport, is most respectfully worded, and treats the Khan as a wholly independent Prince allied to the British Government. And on the 19th of the month following, the same authority writes to the British Agent at Muscat:—- c&lt; As the Government of Gwadur is not under my charge, I have nothing to say to your having gone there.” Even if we go no further, it is important to us to secure a line of boundary placing Gwadur to the eastward of Persian claims, a position which, however now casually admitted, would be doubly sure if officially acknowledged. 15. On the subject of the claims of the Imaum of Muscat, the only two possessions that seem to require notice are Gwadur and Choubar, or Charbar. Those further to the west commence from the point where the Mekran boundary (or at all events the Belooch Mekran boundary) terminates. It is presumed that the tract between this boundary and Persia proper must be considered to be Persian Beloochistan, if not Eastern Kirman. 16. Of the history of Gwadur, little is known prior to its first possession by Sultan Gwadur Syed [Seyyed Sultan] of Muscat about the middle of the last century. From Albuquerque’s Commen taries we learn that one of the conditions which the Ambassador of the Shah of Persia exacted from the Portuguese in the Treaty made at Ormuz in about 1515, was that they should give their aid in retaking Gwadur from a rebellious King of Mekran. The position of Gwadur is described to be between Cape Jask and Sind, and it is called subject to the King of Ormuz. Albuquerque gave the required aid. The name is also contained in several maps, and casually inserted in several gazetteers, both old and recent, but I have been unable to obtain anything like a detailed memoir. 17. Major Green was of opinion that it was a mere temporary possession of the Imaum, lent for a special occasion which no longer existed, and that it rightly belonged to Khelat. This is the view also stated by the son of the Darogha Gul Mahomed in his Memoir of Khelat, translated by Captain Dickinson. The Reverend Mr. Badger thought it was a gift in perpetuum from a former Sultan to a former Khan. The only evidence that I have been enabled to discover, in addition to that obtainable in the records of Government, is that of Haji Abdul Nubbi, published in the Asiatic Society’s Journal under the heading of Tour through parts of Beloochistan in 1838 and 1839. He says : “ The Brahiu’s half “ of Gwadur was given in grant by Meer Nussir Khan to the present Imaum’s “ father,^ Syed Sultan, who took refuge at Khelat during some convulsion of the “ State.” Upon the whole, even setting aside prescriptive right and present posses sion, I think the Imaum’s claim a fair one. Viewed as a possession of a 100 years it seems quite indisputable.15 18. Choubar, Mr. Badger states, was taken by Syud Sultan, grandfather of Choubar t ! le P resent Ruler, “ about a century ago, and has since remained in his possession.” With the limited experience which I possess on Muscat and Persian Gulf affairs, compared to this gentleman, I could not venture to argue upon other premises than these. And viewed in this light, there can be no cause to dispute the Sovereignty of the Imaum, acquired by right of conquest. Whether there be any subsequent terms or treaties modifying the title, I cannot, however, pretend to say. Judging from the great stress laid by the Persian Government upon the non-extension of our Telegraph westward of Choubar without the authority of the Shah, I should think it more than probable that Choubar does belong exclusively to the Imaum. 19. Government have done me the honour to put to me a question of great * Without special instructions. importance. I have not the data to make a satis factory reply, nor do I feel authorized* to make, and await the references which alone could enable me to do so. Mahomed Ali and Been Mahomed of Bhao, Abdul Rhyman of Jeonee, Meer Abdullah of Gaik, and others have yet to tell their tale. The first two, it may be noted, are Judgals of the same Semma family as the Jam of Bela, our immediate neighbour. ^My humble opinion on the subject, with the data available, may be briefly summarized in the following paragraph :— 20. Persia has, of late years, encroached upon territory of which, though her sovereign rights are questionable, her claim to possession is fully equal to that of any Government stronger than that of the petty Chiefs themselves whom she sub jugates. Any interference from without to stop her career, if admissible under the laws and lawful practice of nations should have been exercised long since; but she has now reached a point vital, as it were, to British India, and should be checked at the first good opportunity. Necessity for protecting our telegraphs ; Persia’s own wish expressed to our Minister at her Court for adjustment of boundary ; the acknowledgment of Khelat as an independent State allied to England; all these circumstances show that the present time is most opportune to decide on a line of Paragraph of Report on Mek- boundary for Western Mekran. The Dusht Khor ran Eoute of 22d February 1862. seems to otter an appropriate starting point from the sea side. From hence a line might be run towards Seistan, eastward of which Persia’s interference might be held infraction of treaty. A line of road within the Khelat territory, opening out the Herat trade vvith Gwadur, a port in the same longitude as Herat, should, I submit, be a con sideration for boundary Commissioners on the part of Great Britain. As to Khelat, her claim to any portion of Western Mekran, hitherto unaffected by late Persian aggression, is based, as a general rule, on right of prior conquest not yet annulled by later events. And finally, the question of Gwadur is one between Muscat and Khelat only, with which Persia has no concern, and in which Govern ment has already recorded an opinion, though not declared to be decisive. I have the honour to be, &amp;c., (Signed) F. J. Goldsmid., Lieut.-Colonel, Dated 19th December 1863. . On special duty. P. S. 22d December 1863. Since writing the above, I have read through a file of correspondence connected with a recent communication to Government by the Reverend Mr. Badger. It relates to a Treaty concluded between the Persian Government and Imaum of Muscat in 1856. The perusal of these papers convinces me more than ever of the truth of the conclusions submitted prior to seeing them, and arrived at quite independently. As regards Meer Abdullah of Gaik, alluded to by Mr. Badger, I would deferentially call attention to my 19th paragraph. We have yet to learn his story of his own rights and grievances. By a recent letter from the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, forwarding a Despatch from Her Majesty's Envoy in Teheran, shown to me yesterday, I have also learnt that an objection is now raised by Persia to the use of Gwadur as a Telegraph Station by the British authorities, under sanction of the Imaum of Muscat. Should there be any fair ground of objection stated, and any new right or title to the above Port have become apparent, I would ask permission to see the enclosure, which did not accompany Colonel Petty s letter when lent to me for perusal.

One more quotation from my Diaries will throw light on this point: “ A guide, called in by Rahmut Oollah, informs me that Ormara was formerly in the Khan's territory, the Jam's boundary extending no further westward than Harrian in the Hinglaj mountains. When Mehrab Khan (he must mean the old Nusseer) was on the musnud, he had to do battle with Jam Lulloo, the Gitchkee Chief of Kedje. Jam Meer Khan of Beyla helped the Khan valiantly. Peace was made, and the combatants agreed to divide henceforward, in equal shares, the Kedje revenues. In compensation for the blood shed by the Beyla Chieftain during the fight, his territory was extended westward to beyond Ormara.” J D, From Captain Grant’s Journal of a route through the western ports of Mekran in Yol.

To define Mekran Proper, or the Mekran of Nussir Khan, a very rough outline of Beloochistan, showing the more important localities, will be useful.

We have to do with the western division only. The extreme west, or from the line C. D. to the Persian frontier, appears to Mekran than the Klielat section on the east, and for the following reasons ■ me no more Pottmger considers the Kohistan as a fourth division of Beloochistan, separate from Mekran, owing to its distinct population. He admits that the Bushkurd district is looked upon by the natives as part of the Kohistan, the Kurds who inhabit it never beino- called Mekranis; and the late Captain Urant, who travelled from Gwettur to Bunpoor and from Choubar to Bunder Abbass, talks of the _ eight passes into Mekran, between £ ‘ Mersab and I cannot trace these places.

Nor can we point out on the map where these districts terminate to the southward or where the somewhat large territory of Gaik commences, or how it is divided from Bhao, the country of the Judgal Chiefs.
