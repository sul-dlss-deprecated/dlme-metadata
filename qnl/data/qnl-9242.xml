Gypsum was used as a cementing material and for the manufacture of plaster board. The main deposits were along the coast of Iran (referred to throughout as Persia), but the substance was also more widely distributed in the region.The issue is discussed by British officials in response to an enquiry by the British firm Frank C. Strick and Company. A letter from the Foreign Office expresses the view that there was no reason to discourage such commercial activity in Bahrain or any Arab territory where there was no risk of disputes over sovereignty between the British and Iranian Governments. A letter from the Board of Trade recommends that only 'perfunctory encouragement' should be given to the firm, given the fact that gypsum was available in large quantities in various parts of the world, and this latter approach was adopted by the India Office.The papers are mainly dated 1935-36. There are no papers in the file dated 1937-44.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Gypsum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00019f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00019f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
