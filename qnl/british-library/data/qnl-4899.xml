Accordingly, the orders contained in paragraph 8 of the Government of India, finance Department, resolution Wo.l559 -lSA dated the 16th August, 1921, need not be applied in such cases in future, and the restriction im-nosed by that paragraph regarding the grant of the concession of counting leave for increments in a temporary post (which is admissible under 'Fundamental Kule 26(d) need not be enforced. The Government of India in consultation with the Auditor General, therefore, consider that paragraph 8 of the Government of India, Finance Department, 'Resolution Wo. 1559-m, dated the 16th August, 1921, should be treated as cancelled and that, consequently, the ^fundamental 'Rules can be applied as a matter of course ■ without any further authority from the Government of India in cases like the present one in which the Fundamental Bules are applicable. In these circumstances, I am to state that Fundamental/-s- -ay 'be tslcen to apply l'n the present e^se of ^r # AH Ahmed, ss slso in all Bimilar cases that may arise in fvtvve t sfelct without any further specific orders.

This report ■will, among other things include mention of financial irregulari ties and in this connection I am directed to invite your attention particularly to the importance of a careful observance of all financial rules and regulations ?Jith a view to the avoidance of audit objections. It should also be carefully noted that the Government of India will not as a matter of course accord ex post facto sanction to irregular expenditure in circumstances in which they would not have been prepared to accord an original sanction. It is, therefore, necessary that in cases in which expenditure is not within your powers of sanction, the previous sanction of the competent authority should be obtained before the expenditure is incurred. Financial irregularities which have been rectified to the satisfaction of the Audit Department will not ordinarily be included by the Auditor-General in his report and consequently it is important that the disposal of audit objections should in all cases be expedited with a view to their SstisfactDxry settle ment 1 *.HOME DEPARTMENT.

(2) An application under this rule may be submitted by an officer while he is on leave out of India, and in that case, unless the Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, considers his return to duty necessary before his application can be considered, the rules shall apply to him in the same manner as if his application had been submitted while on duty : Provided that an officer who has made an application under this rule while he is on leave out of India and whose application is sanctioned by the Secretary of State before his leave expires shall not be eligible for the gratuity described in Rule 12, except to the extent ad missible under sub-rule (6) of that rule. 4.

These rates are payable irrespective of the line or class by which an officer or his family travels. (3) Payment of the gratuity admissible under this rule (excluding that portion representing railway fares from London, which shall be paid by the High Commissioner), shall be made by the Governor General or the Governor, as the nase may be, before the officer leaves India. (4) The Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, may sanction the payment of a gratuity calculated as in sub-rules (1) and (2) of this rule, but excluding the fares and passages of the officer himself, to the families of officers who are obliged by climatic or ana logous reasons to leave later than the officer himself, or in advance of the officer but subse quent to the submission of his application to retire. (5) An officer who applies in India for per mission to retire and who is permitted to leave India in anticipation of the sanction of the Secretary of State is eligible for the gratuity. In such cases, if the officer proceeds to the United Kingdom, the Governor General or the Governor, as the case may be, shall authorise the High Commissioner to make payment. (6) Officers who apply to retire while on leave in England and whose families are in India at the time when their retirement was sanctioned by the Secretary of State shall receive a portion of the gratuity equal to the cost, allowing for any special rebates admissible to railway officers, of first-class railway fares and passages for their families when the latter leave India. (7) In no case shall a gratuity admissible under this rule or any portion thereof be pay able until the Secretary of State has sanctioned the officer's retirement under these rules. (8) The gratuity admissible under this rule shall be reduced by the value of any benefit received under the provisions of Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Service Rules in respect of the journey referred to in sub-rule (1) above. (9) The gratuity paid to an officer under this rule shall, in the event of his being per mitted to return to duty in India, be refunded. Such refunds may be made by deductions of 36 equal monthly instalments from the officer's pay-bill, commencing with the first pay-bill drawn after return. (10) For the purpose of this rule the term children means legitimate children or step children of an officer, whatever their age, who are wholly dependent on him. 13. (1) A member of the Indian Civil Ser vice who retires under these rules may adopt at his option any one of the three following methods of retaining for his wife and children benefits, admissible under the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations, namely {a) He may cease to make any contribu tions and payments under the regula tions, and shall then retain only the right to a proportion of the contingent benefits under the regulations for his wife and children existing on the date of retirement, and for any children subsequently born to that wife. This proportion shall be equal to the num ber of his completed years' total service divided by 25, and the calculation shall be based upon the pension admissible to the widow of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the time of his retirement.(b) He may continue up to his 51st birth day to make contributions under the regulations at the rates payable by him at the date of retirement, and shall then retain the right to the full contingent benefits admissible under the regulations, according to his class on the date of his retirement for his wife existing at the date of retirement, and for any children by her, whether born before or after retirement. Under this alternative subscriptions will be payable under the ordinary regula tions for each child, whether born before or after retirement. In the event of the death of the wife, sub scriptions at the bachelor rate appro- i priate to the subscriber's class on retirement will be payable until the age of 51 : Provided fthat in the case of a subscriber appointed to the Service before 1st April, 1910, all such contributions shall cease with effect from the date on which he would have com pleted 25 years' service or from the 1st January, 1930, whichever is the later. (c) He may continue up to his 51st birth day to make contributions and pay ments under the regulations at the rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he \ remained in the service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admissible undqr the regulations as if he had remained in the service until death or retirement with an ordinary pension ; Provided that, in the event of the officer failing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him, he shall be deemed to have elected the first of the above methods. (2) The Secretary of State shall make good to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund under a suitable procedure any loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the, operation of this rule. 14. (1) An officer of the Indian Army or the Royal Indian Navy or of (the Indian Medical Service who retires under these, rules may select any one of the three following options with regard to his subscriptions under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regula tions or to the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund :— (a) He may continue to subscribe^ at the half rate of subscription under Article 28 of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations or rule 32 of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund : or if a married subscriber under the Indian Military Service Family Pen sion Regulations, he may withdraw, receiving the refund authorised by Article 28. If he. continues to sub scribe he will retain the same rights to contingent benefits from the funds f V as if he had retired under the ordinary rules. (&amp;) He may cease to make any payments under the regulations except in so far as is provided by the last sentence of this clause, and shall then retain the right to contingent benefits at the rates admissible under the re gulations to the widow and children of an officer of the class to which &gt;&gt;e belonged at the date of retirement, for his wife and children existing at that date, and for any children sub sequently born to that wife. Under this alternative, any donation pay able under the ordinary rules for any child born after retirement must, however, be paid by the, offic3r if he desires to retain any right to continuance of benefits for any such child. (c) He may continue up to his 55th birth day to make payments under the Regulations at the full rates ap plicable to the class which he would have attained had he, remained in the service until that date, and there after at half rates according to the class in which he is then subscribing. Any donation becoming due after the age of 55 will be payable in full as in the case of ordinary retire ments. His wife and children will in this case be eligible for the full benefits appropriate to the class in which he is subscribing at the date of death : Provided that in the event of the officer fail ing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the, option selected by him lie shall be deemed to have selected the first of the above options. (2) The Secretary of State shall make good to the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme or the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund, ais the case may be, any loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon them by the operation of this rule. (3) The family of a military officer or of an officer of the Royal Indian Navy or the Indian Medical Service who retires under these Rules shall remain eligible for pensions under the Royal Warrant or under the corresponding rules laid down in Pension Regulations for the Army in India or in Regulations for the Royal India n Navy, whichever may be applicable if the officer had on retirement completed 20 years' service. If such an officer is permitted to retire under these Rules after completing less than 20 years' service, the Secretary of State shall, on the death of the officer, grant, subject to the conditions laid down in the Royal Warrant or in the rules referred to above (other than the condition requiring an officer to have completed 20 years' service in order to entitle his widow or children to pensions)— to his widow, a yearly pension of 701. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure corresponding to the number of years total service completed bythe officer at the date of his retire ment ; and to each child, a pension of 16L divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid, or, in the case of a mother less child, a pension of 25^. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid. 15. (1) An officer who is a subscriber, under Section II of the Superior Services (India; Family Pension Fund Rules and who retires with a pension under the Premature Retirement Rules may adopt, at his option, one of the follow ing methods of retaining for his wife and children benefits admissible under the Fund Rules, namely :— (a) He may cease to make any contribu tions under the rules, and shall then retain only the right to a proportion of the contingent benefits under the rules for his wife and children existing on the date of retirement, and for any children subsequently born to that wife. This proportion shall be equal to the number of completed years during which he has subscribed divided by 25. (&amp;) He may continue until the expiration of 25 years from the date on which he became a subscriber to make con tributions under the rules at the rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he remained in the Service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admissible under the rules as if he had remained in the Service : Provided that, in the event of the officer failing tio notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him he shall be deemed to have elected the first of thet above methods. (2) The Secretary of State shall make good to the Superior Services (India) Family Pen sion Fund under a suitable procedure any ioss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the operation of this rule. 16. In the discharge of their functions under these rules, in so far as officers serving in con nection with the affairs of the Federation are concerned, the Governor General shall act in his individual judgment, and, in so far as officers serving in connection with the affairs of a Pro vince are concerned, the Governor General shall act in his discretion and the Governor in his individual judgment. 17. Reference in these rules to the Governor General shall, except as respects matters with respect to which the Governor General is re quired to act in his discretion, be construed up till the date on which Federation is establislie^ as references to the Governor General in Council, and any reference to the Federation, except where the reference is to the establishment of the Federation, shall be construed as a reference to the Governor General in Council.

(3) For clause (a) of Article 514 of the said iiegulations the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' (a) An officer who has obtained a compen sation pension, if re-employed, may retain his pension in addition to his pay, provided that if he is re-employed in a post paid from general revenues, the pension shall remain wholly or partly in abeyance if the sum of the pension and the initial pay on re-employment exceeds his substantive pay at the time of his discharge, that is, an officer can draw so much of pension only as will make his initial pay plus pension equal to his substantive pay at the time of his discharge.

II |36, dated the 18th February 1937. Subject :— Proposed revision of certain Articles in the Civil Service Regulations relating to compensation pension. The Government of India have had under consideration the question of simplifying the various rules in the Civil Service Regulations relating to com pensation pension. 2. Article 426 of the Civil Service Regulations provides for the grant of a compensation pension under certain conditions. The difficulty in applying that Article is due to the fact that it does not explain what constitutes ' suitable 1 employment '. Further, the example given in the Note below the Article does not particularise what ' a temporary loss of pay ' may mean, nor what is meant by the phrase '' for a time ''. Again, the words 4 ' probable prospect of recover ing his former position after a time ' are not too precise. For practical pur poses, therefore, the ruling is unworkable. 3. The example in question allows for a pay in the new post which might be as much as 25 per cent, less than the pay drawn by the Government servant in the post abolished. Under Article 437, Civil Service Regulations, however, a Government Servant who has been granted a compensation pension is obliged to accept re-employment if the offer is made within six months from the date of his discharge ; his pension plus pay on re-employment must, however, be not less than the pay he drew at the time of his discharge. Thus there is a difference between the two Articles referred to. In the opinion of the Government of India there is no justification for that differentiation. 4. The existing rule that once an officer has gone on compensation pension he must accept any appointment which the Local Government thinks fit to offer him within six months of the date of his discharge or else forfeit his pension is not too reasonable and has the added disadvantage that opinions may differ as to what is, and what is not, ' suitable employment The Government of India consider that if a post is about to be brought under reduction Government should have the right to transfer the Government servant affected to another post the conditions of which are deemed by the authority competent to discharge him to be at least equal to those of his old appointment but if such a post cannot be found, it should be left entirely to the Government servant whether or not he takes the compensation pension or gratuity to which he is entitled for the service he has already rendered or whether he accepts further Government employment, even on a lower scale of pay and continues to count his previous service for pen sion. 5. It is also unnecessary to retain the provisions of the last two sentences of Article 426, Civil Service Regulations. Cases of reduction in the pay of a post should be dealt with under Fundamental Rule 23, and there should be no question of discharging an officer on compensation pension or gratuity in such cases. 6. Article 427 is wholly out of place in a body of service rules. It is merely an executive exhortation and not a rule governing conditions of service. The Government of India, therefore, consider that the opportunity should be taken while revising this particular group of rules in the Civil Service Regulations to delete Article 427. 7. The Government of India are further of the opinion that Article 514, Civil Service Regulations which was framed when the pay of posts was generally fixed is really unsuitable for dealing with posts borne on time-scales of pay. It is difficult to see the equity of saying that a person who is retrenched at a certain point in a scale of pay lower than the maximum and is given a compensation pension should, for all time, on re-employment, be limited to a maximum of pay plus pension equal to the point he had reached in the scale when he was retrenched, and whenever his pay reaches that point or exceeds it his pension ceases. To go on reducing the pension each time such an officer gets an incre ment is tantamount to stopping that officer's increments. The Government of India, therefore, propose that once the amount of the pension has been fixed in^ conformity with clause {a) of Article 514, Civil Service Regulations the officer should be entitled- to receive the benefits of increments in his new scale or post without a further corresponding reduction in the pension.2 8. The necessity for retaining Article 517 of the Civil Service Regnlations is doubtful. Once the pay and pension on re-employment have been hxed leave salary would be based on the pay drawn during acertamperwd ltis not equitable that a re-employed Government servant should be deprived during leave of the benefit of any increase m pay which he may have obtained due to increments or promotion so far as it is permissible under the operation of the ordinary rules governing the fixation of leave salary. There is no justification for restricting during the few months of leave what it is proposed to allow for the much longer period of duty. This would leave only one class of case in which the leave salary would be restricted by the operation of Article 517, namelv, that in which a Local Government exercises its powers under Article 514 a) of allowing a Government servant™ re-employment ma bona fide temporary duty to draw pension in whole or m part even though the sum total of pay and pension exceeds the pay which he was entitled to draw m his permanent post at the time of discharge. An officer on bona temporary dutv lasting for not more than a year does not earn much leave and it during th- 0 period of his re-employment he is allowed to draw leave salary pension in 'excess of what would ordinarily be admissible if he were employed perma nently, it is not necesary that, during the short period of leave that he earns by service, a restriction should be placed on the amount of leave salary to which he would otherwise be entitled on the basis of his pay. The Government of India consider therefore that for these reasons Article 517 should be deleted. 9. To give effect to the views expressed above, Articles 426, 427, 437, 439, 514, 515, and 517 of the Civil Service Regulations may be amended on the lines indicated in the enclosed draft. I am to mention that the views of the Local Governments have been obtained with regard to these proposals and subject to the criticisms which are explained below, the draft amendments have been accepted by all other Local Governments. 10. The Government of Bengal have suggested that Article 437 should not be deleted. The arguments in support of their suggestion are :— (1) that it is not always possible to find an officer, whose appointment is abolished, an alternative post immediately, but that an appoint ment such as he can ' reasonably and equitably be expected to accept ' often falls vacant within a short time ; (2) that the terms of Article 437 read with the proposed revised Article 514 provide sufficient safeguards to protect an officer from unfair dealings ; and (3) that the appointing authority can, in its discretion, decide whether the new appointment is, or is not, ' such as the officer cannot reasonably and equitably be expected to accept '. The grounds on which it is proposed to delete Article 437 are given in para graph 4 above. As the rule is considered unreasonable from the point of view of the Government servant and as the principles on which the rules regarding compensation pension were based, are being changed, it is considered that the deletion of the Article would be in accordance with those principles. Once a Govern ment servant has retired on compensation pension. Government should have no right to withdraw that pension. Further, all other Local Governments have accepted the proposal that Article 437 should be deleted and in the circumstances, the Government of India are of the opinion that the suggestion of the Government of Bengal should not be accepted. 11. The Government of Burma consider that it would be desirable in Article 426 to indicate at what time the offer of another post at least equal to the old post is to be made. They have suggested that such an offer shouhi be made at the time of discharge or earlier and that in order to cover this point, the words ' without interruption of service ' should be inserted after the word ' appointed ' in the redraft of Article 426. It follow? from the terms of this draft Article that there will be no break in the service of an officer who is selected for discharge owing to the abolition of his post and is appointed to the other like post, and that the service will be continuous. The insertion of the words suggested by the Government of Burma might lead to difficulties and the Government of India propose that the draft Article should not be amended as suggested by the Local Government.3 12.1 am to request that the orders of the Secretary of State may be obtained on the amendments to the various Articles on the lines indicated in the enclosed draft.

Sir, I am directed to say that, in a recent case in which a Provincial Government decided to proceed against an officer of an All-India Service under rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, the enquiry prescribed in that rule was entrusted solely to a departmental officer subordinate to the officers who had at different times already expressed an adverse opinion on the officer against whom proceedings were taken. In advising on the recommendations made in that case the Federal Public Service Commission observed that an inde pendent authority might more suitably have been associated with the investigating officer in the enquiry in justice no less to him than to the officer against whom the enquiry was held. The Government of India concur in the view ex pressed by the Federal Public Service Commission. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- J.A.

The Central Government therefore -consider that an under taking to this effect should be taken from those officer© who take advantage of the proviso referred to above, but the question vtiether the officer concerned should be called upon to refund the amount drawn in c: r cess as leave-salary should be decided on the merits of each case, jUe^, if 'the retirement is voluntary, refund should be enforced, but if the retirement is compulsorily thrust upon/upon nn of lie or by renson of ill—hcal/th inccipnoitfc.'ting him for further SGrvice^ m refund : abound bo tnken, I havG the honour to be 5 Sir, Your most obedient servant.

If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, it might be necessary to require officers, subject to, ordinary leave miles, who apply for leave on average pay on medical certificate, to give an undertaking that they will reufnd overpayments, if any, if they subsequently decide to retire at the end of the leave or of an extension of that leave. 3. The amendment to Fundrmentrl Rule 81(b) published in the Government of India Notification mentioned above has been incorporated in Bombay Civil Services Rule No,736 and it is desirable to maintain uniformity as far as possible in the interpretation of the two sets of rules, I amaccordingly directed to enquire what arc rulings of the Government of India on these two matters in respect of anendmcnt which has been made in Fundamental Rule 811- ^— No.F.7(54)-R.I/37.

The alterations now made ere explained belows- (1) Direction lo hs suggested by the Chief Commissioner5 Co org, the Government of Coorg has been included in the definition of 9 Government' 1 . (2) Direction 3. The original draft has. been amended in accordence with the revised formula which has been adopted tentatively to govern inter-departmental adjust ments between the Crown Representative's and the Central Budgets.. (3) Direction 4 0 The Auditor-General has accepted the suggestion of the Bengal Government. The Auditor General considers that with the word y oralnfr'il^-' the substitution of 'general and special order' 1 for iS special reasons' the points raised by the United Provinces Government are l sufficiently met and the powers of Provincial Governmeitts are safeguarded. (4) Direction 5, As suggested by the Pun J ab Government the words 'Buildings and Roads Branch 5 * have been added after 'Public Works 3 in the examples of Service Departments under A. The Indian Stores Department has also been included in these examples* AS-15- ks t'cgords the cements of the Beiigsl Govermient, tliQ'Audft'br-Gonoral Would leave the' drafting of this Direction as it iSo The iiuditor-Goneral has no great objection to def ining Service-Department in a negative way but lie Considers that■ the present definition is quite satisfactory5 indeed proferdDlOo The special case of Forests is depit'with''linder Direction 6. The Auditor-Generpa'does ; not agree with the Bengal Government 1 s treatment of GoiTiinercial and Quasi- commercial department So A cominercial department 5 if it : is to be properly so called, must have its accounts framed on commercial principles (not necessarily adopting * every feature of non-Govemment commercial accounts) but this'must be consistent« Otherwise there will be all kinds of accounts showing anything a Provincial- Gpvern- * ment' desires to secure appearing as valid commercial accounts.. The Qua&amp;i- commercial departments are dealt with adequately under other directionss actupJLly these directions do not pffect a Provincial Government's power to maintain where they desire pro f or me: ' commerc i al accounts. The accounts of the Irrigation Departments are maintained more or less in •commercipJ. principles. The Irrigation Department ■ :.f t he Bengal Government has therefore been included in''the list of commercial depart- ments in the Anhexure« - As regards the Cinchona pIp.nt^tions, the Auditor- General do'ubts whether this Bengal- department follows commercial principles in its accounts'', if the Bengal 'Governments desires to continue the exis oing practice of inter-departmental adjustment in the case of this department they will be'-able todo- so o.ndGr Direction 14» (5) Direction 6 . , . : Exception (b) to this Direction has been amended to conform to the arrangement approved in Government of-16- Iniie, Industries pud Labour Department tclogram to the Chi of Commissioner, Amdamans, No*.A«W.18, dated the 5th February 1931, according to which funds are now provided in the Public Works Department Budget to meet the cost of convict labour and local materials supplied to the Public Works Department at Port Blair, In oxception (c) the word Extensive 1 has been .. omitted on the suggestion of the Accountant General, Madras who has pointed out that the question whether the cost of a particular Police guard should be debited to a Project depends, not so much on the extensiveness of the Project as on the fact of the police guard being' an additional guard sanctioned specially for closer supervision of the Project. As regards the suggestioii of the Bengal Government the Auditor General's attitude towards the idea of ^Quasi- Commercial Department' is explained under Direction 5 above. The amendment suggested by the Bihar Government is not necessary as the words w, save as expressly provided by these directions' in the beginning of this Direction art. sufficient to cover any exceptions to be made under Direction 7. (6) Direction As suggested by the Madras Government the word 'may 1 in the first and second sub-paragraphs of this Direction has been replaced by the words ? shall ordinarily 1 . of tbe This virtually meets the suggestion/the Punjab Government. Note 2 under this Direction covers the suggestion of the Railway Board. The note has been drafted in general terms and it is not possible to include in it all the details of adjustments pemitted. (7) Direction 8 . As suggested by the Punjab GovermiEnt the clause ! unless/1 unless the emommt is insignificant 3 has been replaced by the words ^subject to such monetary limit as may be fixed by Government in this behalf^© In Note 1 under this direction - (a) ^ho words ^two or more service departments^ have been sabstituted for ^tv^o or more departments *, This meets the suggestions of the Governments of Punjab and Bihar® (b) In conformity with the suggestion of the Bihar Government 9 the words ? greater part of the land was acquired 1 have been replaced by the words ^major portion of expenditure was incurred' e The Auditor General does not accept the view of Government of Bengal that this Direction and the Notes thereunder should be Quitted altogether® There is so.me~ thing to be said for the Bengal Governments point of view but even then it is hardly necessary to make the change . they suggest* The presumption of the Crissa Government expressed in paragraph 1(11) of their letter of the 22nd January 1937 is not correct® Direction 8 will apply generally both to commercial and non-com ere ial departments and permit a relaxation of the rule when the amount involved is insignificant« The Auditor General wouj-d therefore make the Direction • general*. In view of the general pr ovision in Direction 15 no specific mention need by made in Mote 2 about the recovery of leave and pension contidbutions of the Specla Land Acquisition Officer and of-his establishment« With, reference to the concluding sub-paragraph of the letter from the Government of Orissa 5 it may 'be stated that the i^&amp;pply of agricultural or milk products by/'by agricultural and cattle brccdirg farms to other DGpartmants docs not strictly fall within tho scope of this Direction. The charge in these cases would per., missible if the fauns in question are treated as commercial undertakings« Even if these are not classified as ^comraercial^ a charge would 'be permissible if the Provin cial Government decide to take action under Direction 14o (8) Dir ection 1 0o As suggested by the Controller of the Currency5 the word ^rupee* occurring before the word ! coinage^ has been omittedo ( 9 ) Direction ll Q The substitution of the 'Mathematical Inst rim ent Office* for the words ^Mathematical Instrument Factory t has been made on the suggestion of the Department of Education, Health and Land s c (10) Direction 12 ,.

As a Conpassionate allowance however is granted to an individual as an act of grace the Government of India o - consider tfaesa^ that the grant of .any further concession in the shape of a condonation of a deficiency would not be therefore justified and they consider it undesiratble/that sanctioning authorities should sanction condonation of deficiencies in such cases.

Sir, With reference to your letter No. 1735, dated the ' 6th August 1937, I am directed to say that the expression 'date of entry into that number' in second sentence of Note 2 of the Warrant of Preced'ence means the date on which the officer in question was appointed to the post which entitles him to the precedence in that number. Accordingly as the- District Superintendent of Police was posted to his present appointment before the Deputy Secre tary to the Provincial Government, the former takes pre cedence over the latter in the same Article of the Warrant. I have the honour to bo, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- J.A, Thorne, Secretary to the Governor General (Public).Copy of a letter No, 17.35, dated the 6th August 1937, from the Secretary to the Government of Bind, to the Secro;- tcry to the G-overnor G-eneral (Public). I na desired to address you in connection with note 2 below the Warrant of Precedence published in the G-azette of India No. F. 49/9/35-Public (a) dated the 16th June 1937. The second sentence of note 2 below the Warrant says that officers included in one number will take■precedence inter se according to the date of entry into that number. I am desired to request to be informed whether an officer, who in the old Warrant was included in No. 56 but who has now in the new Warrant been included in No. 55, dates his entry into No.55 from May the 9th, 1937 (the date of His Majesty's assent to the new Warrant) or from the date of his appointment to the post which now entitles him to inclusion in No. 55. 2» The instance which necessitates this reference is as follows. Jk District Superintendent of Police, who in the old Warrant was included in No. 56, was posted to his present appointment in 1935. He was given precedence over a Deputy Secretary to Government, also included in No. 55 in the new Warrant because the Deputy Secretary only entered No.55 in April 1936.i-H' Res. P.

Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department, to His Majesty^s Under Secretary of State for India, London.- : ' PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF THE STUDY LEAVE RULES AND OE THE ■ , . ; ^ ; . LEGAL ■STUDY RULES'* - ' - ■ : I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the India Office letter No.F-4798/1932, dated the 27th Septemper 1932, and to forward for the consideration and orders of the Secretary of State in Council a copy of the letter from the Government of Bengal, No.5857 J. , dated.the 31st July 1936, on the subject noted above• .i. .2 # The local Government point out certain anomalies in Rule 2~A of the :Study Leave Rules. The first of these relates to the inconsistency between this rule and regulation 25 of the Consolidated Regulations of the Inns of Court, London, and the second is that while Rule 2-a requires the-.production'-of a- cert if ioate or cert if iactes from a barri s t er or two bar'ri st ers :after the duration of. study in the chambers, a certificate under rule IQ of , the ■Study Lflave Rn .Xes is .required -before the allowance is granted. The local. Government suggest that the condition of the completion of the passing of the Bar Examination before the grant of .study leave in excess q S six months should 'be removed- from rule 2-A, and that; the Latter should be amended so as to .permit of a .study leave,, in excess of six months being granted provided that, the High Commissioner for .India is satisfied rthat the officer is in fact undertaking, the necessary period :of reading in chambers. Rule 2-A contemplates that the Bar examination must be passed before study leave in excess of six months can be granted, while rule 25 of the;Consolidated Regulations does not, except with special leave from the Council of Legal Education, allow a student to appear for Part II examination unless he has kept six terms. As the keeping of six terms requires more than one year, it seems, to be clear that the,Bar examinations cannotbe passed completely within the six &amp;onths T of 'stiidy iea^e admissible under rule 2.-A in the f irs't' instance. 4» It will 'be o I d served from the despatch' from the Secretary of State,,. Io. 105-Public dated the 20th May 1920 , that it was never intended that the passing o.f the Bar Examinations should ■ - ' ■ ■■ ' '■ ,1 s ' , ] : j, ,, : - • , : i ; precede, readying in the barristers* chambers. The Preamble to the Study Leave Rules, prior to its amendment in 1932 contained ■ a provision ,to the effect thaft the rules, applied also to the members of the Judicial Branch of the Indian Civil Service who were admitted to the benefits of the Legal Study Rules for the period when they were reading in the.chambers of a practis ing barrister in England•,When it was amended in 1932 so as to extend-the application of the rules to these officers also when they are studying for the Bar examinations, the Government of India were under the impression that Barristers do not v /elcome to their chamber^ persons who have not passed the Bar examina tions.- It will however, : be..,f een ; ^ro^^pg^a.,^ of the Bengal Govern ment 1 s letter th^t their officers h^ve experienced no difficulty in finding barristers ready to take them in chambers while they were;still reading.for the examinations' Jt is not therefore necessary to lay down the condition that, the Bar examination'must be completely passed before the grant of study leave in the excess of six months to enable reading in chambers-- The Govern ment of India, agree with the local Government that study for the Bar examination and reading in chambers may be simultaneous., but that; the . only, condit ion which need be imposed , is that no study leave in excess of .six months should be granted unless Part I of the Bar examination has; been '-passed, and the High Commissioner is satisfied that the officer is reading in chambers• They also think that nq, bonus towards barristers* fees .should be allowed until after the Pinal examination has been passed. This vail mean . that the payment . of bonus under rule ( 5) ( c), : of the Legal -study Rules will be deferred till the Pinal examination is pass ed. This seems to be a wholesome provision in order to secure the best advantage of the grant of a bonus. It will not however interfere*.•©l\ v/ interfere with an officer's receiving. the concession of the dispensation of 4 terms under rule 43A of the Consolidated Regulations of the Inns of C.urt. Also it is expected that the officer would take ordinary leave in adaition to study leave during which period he may be able to complete the 12 months reading in chambers* 5, regards the requirement of the production of a certificate of study in barristers* chambers for the grant of study allowance! the Government of India consider that it is desirable to make the drawing of this allowance contingent on the passing of the Final Bar examination- The periods for which it can be drawn should not .exceed eighteen months in the aggregate &gt; and these periods need not coincide with the periods for which study leave has been granted. 6. I am to submit for the approval of the Secretary of State in Council a draft of the necessary amendment to the Study Leave Rules and of a consequential amendment to the Legal Study Rules® Copy with a copy of the encInsures&gt; forwaroeo to the Home Department * x Foreign and Political Departments i/ Legislative Department* Auditor General* for information^ with reference to the Finance Department endorsement Ho.F.13(5)-R.I./52., dated the 5th November 1932. By order, etc., Sd/~ K.K. Chettur, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India., Copy of letter ¥0 .5857 J-, dated tile 31st July 1936, from the Government of Bengal? Judicial Department to : the Government of India, Home Department* l0 gr/int of study leave to mr. t.b»' jameson, i.c.s. ; in paragraph 5 of Appointment Department letter No»5452 A. , da-ted- the •S&amp;th .March 1936 , it was stated that the examination of Mr. Jameson's case had disclosed certain anoma lies in the revised rule (2A of the Study Leave Rules .and that the local Government would ^ddress the Government of.India shortly on that subject. I;am accordingly directed to state as' foilowss — ■ i« Rule- 2 A Lays.-docwn that the Bar examination must 'be passed completely before st.uay leave in excess of six months can be granted® This appears to be an impossible condition. Rule 25 of • the co ; nsolidat e.d reg^Lat i.ons of the Inns of Court while p6rmi11ing a -stud©nt to present himself for a 11 the examinations in Part I at any time after admission, does not ordinarily kHx i allow'-him to appear, in Part II unless he has kept six terms* The keeping of six terms requires .more than one year and an officer from India cannot in any case be expected to pass the 'examinations comple^ie^y-wiothin /the al^lotte^ six months' stuay leave-uriles^^ he .had .previously;; a ; ev '0 .ted ordinary leave out of India for .perlod to this matter- .The new rule therefore appears i©'be inconsistent with the regulations for the Inns ■ of Court c # - . ? : . . t .■ , ' ; 2(1). It is suggested therefore tiaals rule 2A should be amended to allow for the following to be granted to an officer who has been admitted to the benefits of the rules for assistance of officers.. who wish, to prosecute their studies at one of the Inns of Court • f' (l) A maximum of, 18 months study leave in all.(2) Six months study leave for the purpose of reading for'the examination, whether he also reads in Chambers or not. The officer to satisfy the. High Gommis si oner that he is following a proper course of »tudy. A condition that no study leave in excess of 6 months will be granted unless Part I has 'been passed. (3) A further condition'that no study leave in excess of 6 months will be granted unless the officer satisfies the High dommissioner that he is reading in the Chambers of a practising Barrister. (Vide also paragraph 4 below) o ' (ii) As regards (2) above it may be noted that an officer may choose to study for and take part of the' examination while on ordinary leaves for example he might take the whole, of Part I during such leave. He should then be eligible, for, 6 months study leave for taking the remainder without reading in Chambers® But if he utilises the period of six months for taking Part I, then he will be unable to obtain any further study leave unless (a) he has passed Part I and (b) he satisfies the High Commissioner; that he is reading in Chambers* ' T (iii) It may further be noted that rule 2 of the Study Leave Rules already provides ordinarily for a limit of twelve months at one time to the grant of study leave. 3. In this connection I am to invite a reference to finance Department letter Eo.5 , ,15(5)-R.I./52, dated the 11th July 19,32, to His Majesty's Under Secretary of State for India (copy forwarded to this Government with Home Department letter ^doP.344/32-J'udicial, dated the i5th December 1932) on whish the new rule...2A appears to be ••• ; . i t)' - based* This letter states that it is very unusuajli simultaneously to read in the Chambers of a practising Barrister, to attend lectures in the Inns of Court and study for the Bar examinations and that Barristers do not welcome to their Chambers persqns who have not passed the Bar examinations. It may be noted however that officers under this Government, including Mr.Jameson, have ,experienced no difficulty in reading in Chambers before passing the examinations* The conditions in respect of a Judicial Officer from India may well be'be different from those of a young man. at Home who has Just left school or a University and Barristers will readily realise that an officer possessing actual judicial experience in India is much more capable of pulling his weight than a man fresh from school or Universityo 4. The second anomaly appears to lie in the require ment of a post hoc certificate of the Barrister in whose Chambers the officer undertakes to read. The wording of the new rule ZA relating to this certificate seems to have been taken verbat im from rule 43A of the regulations for the Inns of Court which deals with exemption from keeping terms after l^mmonths* reading in Chambers- But for the purpose of study leave a certificate is required to justify the drawing of study allowance and it seems sufficient to rely on rule 10 of the study leave rules unless a monthly certificate is to be required. In the opinion of this Government rule 2A should be amended so as to permit of the study leave in excess of six months being granted provided that the High Commissioner is satisfied that the officer is in fact undertaking the necessary period of reading in Chambers• This Government is also of opinion that it is iiapracticable to insist on the completion of one year's reading as a condition of the grant of such leaves for either the payment of the allowance must be held up until the yea^s reading is completed, or there will have to be provision for recovering any allowance paid to an officer who fails to complete the period. Rule 5(C) of the rules for the assistance of officers who v /ish to prosecute legal studies itself provides a strong inducement to the officer to complete his year's reading, as only by so doing can he obtain the bonus of £75 in part refund of any fee actually paid to a practis ing Barrister for reading in his Chambers-The following rule shall be substituted for the existing Rule 2^A of the Study Leave Rules?- In the case of an officer who has 'been admitted to the 'benefits of the rules for the assistance of officers on leave in the United Kingdom who wish to prosecute their legal studies ax one of the Inns of Court, London, or the King's Inns, Dublin, study leave for a period of six months may be granted for the purpose of studying for the examinations prescribed for a call to the Bar on a programme approved by the High Commissioner, and of reading in the chambers of a practising barristerySuch reading, however, will be optional during this period. Study leave for a further period not exceeding twelve months may be granted, after Part i of the Bar examinations has been passed, for the purpose of reading in the chambers of a practising barrister, and for completing the Bar examinations- On passing the Pinal Bar examination the officer will be entitled to draw study allowance under rule 10 for periods not exceeding eighteen months in the aggregate, but these periods need not coincide with the periods for which he has been granted study leave# Draft amendment to Legal Study Rules * For clause (c) of rule (5) of the Legal Study Rules, the following clause shall be substitued, namelys- '(e) On passing the Final Examination for a call to the Bar, a bonus of £75 in part refund of any fee actually paid to a practising Barrister in England for reading in his chambers.'lTo.F.8(l)-R.l/37.

HjS'S, dated the 2 nd January 1936. Subject Proposed amendment of clause {b) of Article 526 of the Civil Service Regulations. I am directed to refer to the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 5-Financial, dated the 1st June 1933, axnending inter alia Article 526 of the Civil Service Regulations. It has now been brought to the notice of the G-overnment of India that clause {b) of the Article as then amended is ultra vires, in so far as it relates to British warrant non-commissioned officers and men and possibly also to British service officers. It is understood that when a British Othpr Rank is discharged to pension, the Chelsea Hospital authorities regard them selves as not being empowered save under the terms of the Royal Warrant to withhold the pension and in view of this, neither the Government of India nor a Local Government can be empowered to withhold the pension. Further, there is *dri anomaly as regards the position under the old and the revised Article 526 {h), Civil Service Regulations as regards the basis of the calcula tion of the civil pension of a military pensioner continued in civil employ. 2. Cases have arisen in which officers have earned a military pension during their civil employment and yet continued in civil employment and therefore it is necessary to legislate for them in a way that is not only fair but legal. The Government of India have, therefore, reconsidered afresh the question of revising clause (&amp;) of Article 526, Civil Service Regulations in order to remove the defects mentioned in paragraph 1 above. The following two alternatives have been considered in this connection :— {a) to amend Article 526 {b) so as to limit its scope to pensions payable from Indian revenues, and to add a new sub-clause (c) governing pensions or portions of pensions payable by the Home estimates. In this new sub-clause (c) provision would have to be made to allow such pensions to be drawn from the date they are earned, and the question would then arise whether the amount of such a pension should be taken into consideration with a view to a reduc tion in the civil pay of the officer during continued employment, or (6) to abrogate the principle on which clause (b) of Article 526 is based and bring all officers who earn a military pension while in civil employ under the same principle as is laid down in Article 526 (a) for those who have already earned a military pension before they are employed in a civil capacity. The Government of India are in favour of the adoption of alternative (b). The objection to alternative (a) is that it would give rise to differential treat ment of officers who have earned a pension payable by Home estimates as com: pared with those who have earned a military pension payable by Indian estimates. Also if, as would have to be done, the' pay in continued civil employment of those in the new category—sub-clause (c)—be reduced in con sideration of the military pension they would draw, then they would earn a lower civil pension for their civil employment than those whose pensions are payable by Indian revenues and who would remain governed by the existing sub-clause (b). Further, the anomaly pointed out in paragraph 1 above will remain intact. The only objection to alternative (b) is that, as the pay of the officers would be reduced in view of the military pension drawn, they would draw a lower civil pension based on the lower civil pay than they can do at present under existing clause (b). There is little force in this objection since, as will be seen from paragraph 1 above, clause (b) as amended by the Secretary of State in Council in 1933 gave an unintentional concession. 3. In this Department Despatch to the Secretary of State No. 9, dated tho 22nd December 1932, justification was shown for making a differentiation between the military pensioner who is employed in the civil after earning a military pension and the person who earns a military pension while in civil employment and continues in civil employment. It is arguable that there is justification for making such a differentiation if the necessity for differentia tion arises but it is considered that no such necessity does arise. If an officerearns a military pension while in civil employ, it means that upto that date his civil service has not been qualifying tor a civil pension, because an ofiicer cannot earn two ordinary pensions ai once. His civil pensionaoie service must, theretore, start to run irorn tiie day atier he nas earned his military pension, 'ine Government of india see no necessity for nolding that tnat civil pension must be based on a higner civil pay tnan the omcer would have been entitled to draw under Article oAti {a) it ne had earned his military pension before ne entered civil employ. If the officer, in view of being allowed to draw his mili tary pension, has His civil pay reduced and does not like it, it is open to mm to decline to serve. The conclusion of the (iovernment of India is, thereiore, that by tar the simplest remedy is alternative (6). in order to give elfect to this, tney submit for the consideration of the Secretary of State m Council a draft amendment of clause (6) of Article 52(3. The Grovernment of India recommmd that the amended rule may apply with retrospective effect from the 3Uth May 1933 to military pensioners wnose continued employment in a Civil Department started after tnat date and who are in civil employ on the date on which the rule is amended. If this is not done and the amended rule is made applicable in cases in which continued employment begins from the date the rule is amended, the claim to pay and pension m the Civil Department of British Service Officers, 'Warrant and non-commissioned officers and men who earned or will earn a military pension while in civil employ after the revi sion of Article 526 (6), Civil Service Regulations in 1933 but up to the date of the passing of the proposed amended rule, will continue to be regulated by the existing Article which in so far as it aft'ects the British Service Officers has been held to be ultra vires. The proper course therefore appears to be to apply the proposed rule with retrospective effect as suggested. It is, however, not proposed to reopen the case of men who cease to be in civil employ before the amended rule is promulgated. 4. The Government of India propose to promulgate a similar amendment in respect of the services under the rule-making control of the Governor- General in Council and to invite Local Governments to take similar action in respect of their services. The amendment will adversely affect members of the services under the rule-making control of the Governor-General in Council, who were in service on the 27th May 1930, and those under the rule-making control of Local Governments who were in service on the 9th March 1926 and I am to request that the Secretary of State in Council may kindly be moved to accord his sanction, under Rule 9 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, to the issue by the Governor-General in Council and Local Governments of such an amendment. Amendment to the Civil Service Regulations. For clause (6) of Article 526, the following shall be substituted :— ' (h) A military officer, departmental officer, warrant or non-commissioned officer or soldier who earns a pension under military rules while he is in civil employ, shall draw such pension while he is in civil employ, but the authority competent to fix the pay and allowances of the post in civil employ may, with effect from the date on which the officer or soldier becomes entitled to the pension, alter such pay and allowances with reference to such officer or soldier after taking into account the amount of the pension '. Copy of demi-official, letter from F. E. Gkist, Esq,., Financial Secret art, India Office, Whitehall, to W. Christie, Esq., M.C., I.C.S., Deputy Sec retary to the Government of Indla, Finance Department, No. F. 481 1 36, dated the 6 th february 1936. Will you kindly refer to your official letter of the 2nd January 1936, No. F. 6 (82) |R. II135, regarding the re-employment of military officers in Civil Depart ments. We agree that the second of the two courses suggested by the Govern ment of India is the better, but before submitting the proposals for the con sideration of the Secretary of State in Council, there are two points on whiich we should like to have some further information. 2. The draft amendment speaks of a military officer, etc., who ' earns a pen sion under military rules '', and we are not quite clear whether by this the Gov ernment of India intend that the officer or soldier should be required to retire or take his discharge from the Service as soon as he has qualified for a militarys pension, or whether it is intended to retain him in the Army, if he is an officer until he reaches the age for compulsory retirement or, if he is a soldier until he can claim discharge with pension. From the point of view of the Civil Depart ment, the former course has advantages inasmuch as it enables the employing authority to make a saving in pay charges at the expense of Army estimates and possibly of the War Office, corresponding to the amount of military pension in issue, but it might conflict with the rule in the Civil Service Regulations which forbids a Government Servant to retire voluntarily from the Service in order to take up another post and draw pension in, addition to pay, and the Govern ment of India may think it desirable to apply the principle of this rule to the cases now under discussion. In that event some amendment of the draft sub mitted by the Government of India would be necessary, as it would be possible. as it is at present worded, for an officer or other rank with the connivance of the employing authority to draw the full pay of a civil post plus military pension. 3. If the intention were to reduce the pay of the post by the amount of the pension the officer or soldier might very well object to being required to retire from the Army on a lower rate of pension than he could earn by further military service, unless he were sure of receiving a proportionately higher civil pension as the result of his civil service rendered after retirement from the Army. 4. The second point relates to the question raised in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 2 of your letter. It is true that, the adoption of the course pro posed by the Government of India would, as regards civil pension, bring those coming under Article 526 (b) into line with those coming under Article 526 (a), but the effect is .that the re-employing authority escapes a part of what might be regarded as the normal pension liability of the civil post, because the pay of that post has been reduced by the amount of pension earned by army service, but here, unlike the saving in pay charges, the saving is made at the expense of the officer or other rank. We are inclined to think that, subject to any considerations the Government of India may wish to urge to the contrary, both rules require some modification in this respect. It does not seem to us lo be equitable that the civil pension should be calculated on anything less than the full pay of the post—or^ the unreduced pay of the officer if he is on a time-scale rate of pay. We think it should be ruled that notwithstanding any reduction of civil pay made in accordance with the provisions of these two paragraphs of Article 526, the civil pension of the incumbent should be calculated on the full civil pay of the post. We do not know what view the Secretary of State in Council would take of the point, but it would be useful to have the considered view of the Government of India to place before him when the case is submitted for decision. I imagine that in practice the point arises only in connection with other ranks, and possibly departmental officers, as Indian Army, Koyal Engi neer and Indian Medical Service officers in civil employ continue to earn pension under military rules.

Grist, Esq., Financial Secretary, India Oppice, Whitehall, No. F. 6 (82)^ 11135 dated the 17 th december 1936, and enclosure. . n _ Wi11 7°^ please refer to your D.-O. No. F. 481|36, dated the 6th February 1936, to Christie. The delay in replying has been due to the fact that we have had to consult various departments before coming to a decision on the points raised. ^ 2. As regards the point raised in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your letter that the intention underlying the phrase ' earns a pension under military rules ' is not quite clear, I may say that we did not contemplate any departure from the principle enunciated in Article 509A of the Civil Service Regulations and that it was not the intention that military personnel in civil employ should be made to retire from the Army sooner than they would have done in the ordinarv course. As, however, the phrase used in our draft amendment mio-ht be inter preted to mean this, I suggest that it might be amended with advantage to who is granted a pension under military rules '. This would remove anv suspicion that the new rule is intended to force military personnel to retire from the Army sooner than they would in the ordinary course of events and consequently on a lower military pension than they could otherwise earn If this suggestion is accepted it will be necessary to substitute the words 'whoV o is granted a pension under military rules ' for the words ^ who earns a pen sion under military rules ' occurring in line 3 of the re-draft of clause (h) of Article 526 which was forwarded with our letter of the 2nd January. It will also be necessary with a view to keeping up the same phraseology that the words from which the pension is granted ' should be substituted for the words ' on which the officer or soldier becomes entitled to the pension ' in lines 8-9 of the redraft, and that the words after he has been granted a pension under military rules ' should be substituted for the words ' after he has earned a pension under military rules ' occurring in the first sentence of Article 525. 3. You have observed that it would be possible under the draft amendment as it stands for an officer or other rank to draw the full pay of the post plus military pension with the connivance of the employing authority. I admit that the rule is not mandatory and that had we contemplated any departure from the principle that a Government servant should not be allowed to retire voluntarily from service in order to take up another post and draw pension in addition to pay, we might have run the risk pointed out by you, but we have no intention of going back on the principle laid down in Article 509A. As for the amendment not being mandatory, the power to fix the civil pay of such Government servants vests in the authority competent to fix the pay and allowances of the civil post which is generally an authority higher than the employing authority, and such authority may be expected to exercise its discre tion judiciously. In any case the position is not different from that under Article 526 {a) and the Government of India consider that it is not necessary to prescribe any hard and fast rule regarding the proportion of military pension which must be deducted from civil pay. 4. As regards the point raised in the last paragraph of your letter that pension in the civil department should be based not on the civil pay for a military pensioner as reduced after taking into consideration the military pen sion but on the pay he would have drawn in the civil post had he not drawn a military pension. The question had been considered already by the Govern ment of India before they approached the India Office with the recommendation made in their letter, dated the 2nd January 1936, and they arrived at the con clusion that no departure should be made from the accepted principles of Article 486, Civil Service Regulations, in view of the fact that only a few individuals were likely to earn civil pension and that those who did not like the reduction in their civil pay with its resultant effect on civil pension need not continue in civil employ. As stated in our letter of the 2nd January, the exist ing Article 526 (&amp;) gave an unintentional concession so far as the basis of the calculation of the civil pension of a military officer continued in civil employ was concerned. Under the old Article the civil pension was calculated on the pay of the civil appointment reduced by the amount of the military pension. The revision proposed by the Government of India therefore aims at restoring this position by withdrawing this unintentional concession and they would reaffirm the view already expressed that the civil pension should be based on the pay actually drawn and not on the unreduced pay of the post. One point, however has arisen in this connection which needs mention. The intention is'to amend the rule with retrospective effect from the 30th May 1933 and it will be necessary to protect the rights of officers who are in civil employ on the date on which the rules are passed by the Secretary of State in Council and were granted a pen sion under military rules on or after the 30th May 1933 but before the date on which the rules are so passed and whose pay has been reduced under clause (h) of Article 526 Civil Service Regulations. It will be necessary to make a specific provision m the Civil Service Regulations for the protection of the rights of 0 ^ ( ; e ^ s this can be given effect to by means of a rule under Article 487 ot the Civil Service Regulations. a A I -or UCl0 ', e ,, he ^ With f ? r a revised draft of clause of Article o26 and draft amendments to Articles 487 and 525, which jrive effect tn the views expressed above.

When an officer governed by Appendix M, Passage Regulations, India, is lent temporarily, to a civil department or a foreign employor, a passage contribution at the rate of Rs.50/- a month, is recovered from the department, concerned for the period during which the officer is lent.. As a passage contribution is recovered from the temporary employer it is logical that the period of service rendered by( &gt; an officer in temporary civil or foreign employ 5 should count towards his Indian service for leave passage concession in une same way as a period of' service with the Military Pol ce Forces in India counts under the existing rule* The Grovernrnent of India, therefore recommend that for the purpose of passages under . Part I of Appendix M, Passage ' Regulations 9 India, the note referred to above should he so amended as to permit officers to count towards their Indian service any period of service rendered by them in temporary civil or foreign employ, irrespective of the nature of their appointments therein. I am to request that, orders/of the Secretary of State on this proposal may be -obtained and communicated to this Department as soon as possible. 4* If the Secretary of State agrees s ,it is proposed to give retrospective effect to the amendment to cover all cases of officers governed by Appendix AA, Passage Regulations, India, who have been in temporary civil or foreign employ su;,-sequent to the introduction of the pa,ssage concession rules, i.e. the i4th February 1925.

In the case of tho Royal Artillery Officers included in categories (c) to (f) of the heading to the Appendix, paragraph 5 of tho supplementary rulos to Part I seems to make tho position sufficiently clear by linking tho quostion of passage ontitloment with that of eligibility for Indian clement of pension. A passage contribution would theroforo apparently bo required only if tho officer's lent service wore such as would count for Indian pension, and consequently for passage concossions» In the circumstances, therefore, while it is -greed that service for which a passage contribution is recovered should count for loavo passage concossions, it is not thought that any further amendment of tho regulations is nooded, and sinco the amendment published in correction slip No.101 of 1933 servos no roal purposo, no objection would bo raised to its cancollaoicn if desirod by the Government of India.im I Kes.

I am to explain that the letter quoted above was not intended to lay down a rule for all such cases but merely to express an opinion. Further, it was not the intention of the Federal Public Service Commission's observations that because a superior officer directs an enquiry, a suoordinate cannot carry it out. It is only when 8. definite opinion on the point at issue has already been expressed by the officer or officers superior to the enquiring officer that the Commission consider the desirability of associating with him an independent officer (who need not necessarily be an officer ouosio-e the particular Service, Office or Department).-Res.

S. ? 1 ■ Under Secretary to the Government of India, To All Minor Local Governments. Subject:- Presentation of passage certificates by Lee Commission passengers to Steamship ■. Companies. Sir, I am directed to state that certain Steamship Companies have complained tha.t they sustain considerable loss owing to the fact that passengers provided with passage under the Lee Commission scheme ask for cancellation of accommodation, reserved for them on steamers, at such short'notice that.it cannot be relet to others. From such pasSangers the Companies accept passage certificate in iieu of the usual deposit in token of the passenger's acceptance of the accommodation reserved. The Companies state, however, that such passengers frequently represent that they are unable to present their passage certificates to the Companies until a month or two prior to departure, on the ground that Audit Officers do not issue the passage certifi cates until near the date of sailing. The belated issue of passage certificates seems to be due to the misconception that under the existing procedure such certificates c. n only be issued after an officer's leave has been sanctioned On the contrary officers 'are at liberty to secure passage certificates at any time te suit their convenience. Audit Officers are, therefore, being informed that there.is no objection to/to the issue of passage certificates t« - officers any time they ask for them.

Subject:- Investigation and payment of claims to arrears of pa^, allowances or increments. The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to Article 8 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I, which lays down that no claim against Government not preferred within 6 months of its becoming due. can be paid without the sanction of the Accountant General and that claims of officers, whether gazetted or not, to arrears of pay or allowances or to increments which have been allowed to remain in abeyance for a period exceeding one yearj cannot be investigated by an Accountant General except under the special orders of the loc^l Government or Department of the Government of India or subordinate authority to whom this power has been delegated,. 2. The pre-audit of such arrear claims involves a great deal of labour which is often out of all proportion to the amount or the importance.of the claims preferred, and instances that have come to light indicate that the power to sanction investigation of such claims is apt to be indiscriminately exercised. 3. It has accordingly been decided in consultation with the Auditor General that delegation to authorities subordinate to the Central Government of the power to sanction the investigation of arrear claims shall bo limited in future to claims not more than three years old so that the investigation of older claims will require-2- roquirc- the san.ction 'of the Gentral Oovornment» ^ is 'to be emphasise a.

They have therefore decided that this system should be replaced by one under which Bombay Medical p.uthorities will submit their bills, signed in token of acceptance by the patient, direct to the Head of the Department concerned for settlement, the Share payable by the patient being recovered subsequently from his salary bill. 2. Whenever a claim of this nature is presented for payment, the p.uthority responsible for payment will first work out what portion of the total charge will be payable by Government and what portion by the Government servant concerned, and then charge the former straightaway against the Revenue expenditure had concerned but classify the latter as an item of 'Advances recoverable - Civil advances'. The whole amount recoverable should normally be recovered in the next month 1 s salary bill, 3, The undersigned is directed to request that the revised procedure may be follo¥/ed in future in respect of hospitals maintained by the Government of Bombay.

In accordance with the principle accepted by the Government of India., Department of Education, Health and Lands in paragraph 2 of their letter No.320-Health, dated the 19th February 1929, the Local Government will recover from an officer of the Central Government charges on account of the medical treatment rendered to him and that officer will in due course claim reinbursement himself from the Central Government c I ran to add that the Local Government propose to sanction the rates of fees mentioned in paragraph 1 above with retrospocLive/ ■rotrospGctiyG effect from 1st August 1935 in order to enable the Civil Surgeon, Poena, to recover the bill.due to him from the Accountant General, Bombay, (Mr. l.R*.

Will the Secretary to Government of Bombay, General Department, kindly refer to the hospital fees rules published in Government, General Department, Notification No,5731♦, dated the 17th August 1922? While the present Accountant General, Bombay, was attending the meetings of the Public Accounts Committee cat Poena, he fell ill with fever and called in the Civil Surgeon, Poena to the Club of Western India, where he was staying on Friday, the 9th August, The 131 vil Surgeon .returned to visit him on the 10th and 11th and ordered him into the Sessoon Hospital on the 11th where he stayed till the 16th • August • 2. while in hcnspital he paid a hospital bill in advajoce for 7 days, : a* day for medical and nursing' charges^ t he % ^13/~&gt; whi ch. was f inally adjusted t o S^aysatfeTiS/^^e ing appor t i oned thus s - Es. 5/~ for beard| Es. 5/- for medical and nursing charges; .and Rs.3/- for a, private room. Subsequent to his discharge the Ciifil Surgeon has preferred a bill for r -, 48/- at 16/- a visit for his attendance at the Club of Western India on the 9th, 10th and 11th August. 3. As the Bombay Government has refused to enter into reciprocal arrangements with the Central Government for medical attendance and hospital charges for their respective personnel, an individual officer of the Central Government entitled to free medical and nursing services has to pay in cash, and then recover the medical charges in full, and the hospital charges after f a deduction for board, from his Government. It is obvious that his Government will not pay more than the scales ..of in clmrges sanctioned f or these purposes by the Government ^administrative charge of the-medical Officer and of the Hospital. There Oan, therefore, be no priva/be arrangement regarding the Medical Officer^ fees, as is suggested in the last sentence of the Surgeon General T s reply of the. 1st October 1935, (copy enclosed) between the patient and his medical Officer. The scale of fees for medical attendance must be settled by the Government providing the services and accepted as reasonable by the paying Government. - Otherwise it might well happen that the patient would heave no recourse but to pp.y whatever fees the Medical Officer demanded, and find subsequently that his Government considered these fees/-foes unrer.sombly high and declined to refund them in full to him. Thusf the Secretr.ry of Str,te f s purpose of securing free medical attendance everywhere in British India to entitled officers would be defeated♦ The ODvernment of Bombay has, hitherto, sriictioned no scale of fees exigible in.such circumstances| and it is therefore su^ested that the omission be made good now -with retrospective effect, 4, As regards the Hospital charges, it appears from the Bombay Government's orders that the proportion allotted, to board is half of a graduated scale of fees depending on the pay of the prtient. It is not likely that the Central Government will accept this method as reasonable. After a certain ..stage in scale, it .is obvious that a patient whose it .y is more, costs no more for board than a patient whose is less. .The. OenteJ Government is accustomed to .the Army scale, whereby, a flat rate, of deduct!d is made for board from Officers treated in the Militcary Hospitals, It is s^-ggGsteo..that .a scale of this type ¥/hich would be .more acceptable to the Central Government, be. substituted for the existing scale. 5, Then there is the question of the charge for a private room to be paid by the patient . The Bombay-Government charges both in St. George^ Hospital ? Bombay, and Sassoon Hospital, Poena seem dispropcrtior.p, tely high, when it is remembered that the entitled, servants of the Bombay Government would get a private room as a matter of course in the Central hospitals of Delhi pjid Simla. In fact, the Accountant General was given a room so small that he. doubts whether he would have occupied loss space in the general Ward. He makes no complaint, however, on this ground, as it is Ipxgely a matter between him and the Central Qsvern- ment to e.rgue that, but for the private room, he could not have continf^ , ... ■ , • • , ; to dictate notes, etc,,, to his stenographer regarding the files which reached him daily in hospital from his office. 6, The Accountant General feels that he should not pay, as a matter of principle, the Civil Surgeon f s bill till the Bombay Government : have sanctioned a definite scale of fees for medical attendance in quarters on entitled Central Government servants, because his Audit Officer refuses to. make him any refund unless and until the Bombay Government sanctions such a scale. His contention regarding board is of less importance, but it seem; expedient that it.too should be considered and settled, with the concurrence of the Central Government, as a general question.OFFICii Of TH£ iiOCOJKMT GiSNiiiAL CKTOAL KEVENUiiiS, 7/1 , NEw DELHI-, No. TM 14-34-^^ Dated the From 31 Of EB 1833 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL, CE1\1TRAL REVENUES, TO Th® Political Agent, BAHRAIN.

Recent inquiries into cases of leakage of information from the Secretariat elicited the fact that several members of the ministerial estc blisnment of the Crovernmeno of India were inde bted to irrofe^sional mo ;-e 7 lender s. From tdie point of view of security of inform tion the dangers of indebtedness among Government servants are obvious, and the question h&lt; s been exrmined whether any solution to the problem can be found by invoking existing debt legislation. No definite solution on these lines is apparent, nor can legislative or executive action be taken to give special protection to G -overnmont servants. The matter can, there fore, only be ^alt with by taking proper and prompt dis ciplinary action in cases where employees in Government offices are obviously placing themselves in a position of financial embrrrassment. This can be achieved by greater vigilance in office supervision, since an attachment order cannot be enforced against r.

It has been prescribed therein that where one department makes payment or renders service as an agent of another department of the same Government, the principal department may, subject to such monetary limit as may be fixed by Government in this behalf, be charged with the expenditure incurred on its behalf by the agent department. No such monetary limit appears to have been fixed by Government. But under Article 112, Civil Account Code, Volume I, if the amount of contingent expenditure incurred in this way is not less than Rs. 50 the principal department is charged. I would, therefore, enquire whether this sum may, for the purpose of direction No. 8 referred to above, be treated as the monetary limit fixed by Government. o 1\&lt; Iff AO Res. P, G, No, 32.

The undersigned is directed to refer to the Home Department Off ice memorandum No. ?.337/34-Ssts., dated the 8th June 1936 in which was declared the decision of the Government of India,- to establish a convention whereby the Governor General in Council 'in case of officers appointed by him' should consult the federal Public Service Commission whenever he proposes to pass an order awarding a pension, including an additional pension, less than the majcimuy admissible under the rules. Occasion has arisen to consider ■hether an order reducing a pension can in certain circum- stances be the subject of an appeal and if so to whom such an appeal should lie. The Government of India have also had occasion to examine the question whether the protection of the convei:'V-n should be confined to officers appointed by the Governor General in Council or should bo extended to other officers under his-rule-making control, 2. Although the question whether an appeal lies from an v-raer reducing pension is not free from doubt, the Govern ment of India do net consider it unreasonable that an officer affected by such an order should have the ri^it of appeal. Tney have therefore decided that whenever an order reducirg the pension of an officer under the rule-making control of the Governor General in. Council is passed, the officer affected shall have a right of appeal to the authority to v /nom an appeal from an order of dismissal or romoval lies* The necessary rules providing for apperJiin tiios^ases will oe notified under section 241 of the Government of India Act. 3. ?/horo the original order of reduction of pension is passed by the Governor General in Council, the Federal Public Service Commission shall by convention be consulted before die order is passed. This convention shall also be extended so as to require prior consultation with the Commission before any order is passed by the.

Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No.F.1881/37, dated the 9th Juno 1937, regarding the amendment of the Study Loage Rules in so far as they relate to officers studying for call to the Ba,r. Under the new Rule 2A an officer may not be granted study allowance during the initial six months study leave which ho is .permitted to take before passing Part I of the examination until he nas passed the final Bar examination. This rule is, in respect of the grant of study allowance, more restrictive than its predeces sor. The Government of India ha.d not intended to maJce it so restrictive and consider that there is no rea-son why the ordinary conditions under which study allowance is drawn should not apply to the case of study for the Ba,r* The allowance should, in their opinion, be drawn from time to time on the production of the necessary certificates. I cam, therefore, to request that the Secretary of State may be moved to amend Rule dA by deleting the words 'On passing the final bar examination' which appear at the beginning of the concluding sentence of that rule* I have the^honour to be.

I am directed to say that although the object of Supplementary Rule 6(a) is to restrict a Government servant's title to compensatory allowance during leave to periods of leave not exceeding four months, other than luave preparatory to retirement, Givernment servants in receipt of compensatory allowance have in certain cases defeated this object by taking leave for four months or less, returning to duty for a few days only, and then retiring. 2. Authorities empowered to s anction leave should therefore scrutinise with special care leave applications from Government servants on the verge of retirement and an should, in cases where there is ^obvious intention to evade Supplementary Rule 6(a), refuse to grant leave of any other kind than 'leave preparatory to retirement'. 3 b I am to add that audit officers have been requested to bring to the notice of Government any cases of clear abuse which come to their notice.

As regards item (i), this' exaniihe.t'ion falls into two distinct categories, namely - (a) Examination to obtain a certificate of physical ■fltneas filed with ..an application as a condition precedent to appointment. This certificate has to be obtained by the candidate himself on payment and Government have no liability inthe matter.

The Government of India have decided that the initial certificate covered by item.(a) .above should in the case of gazetted officers stationed_in or passing through Bombay end Poona be obtained from the Military .Medical Officers entrusted with the duties of attendance on such officers.- The non-gazetted staff drawing more than Rs.250/- per mens em stationed in or. travelling through Bombay and Poona should obtain their initial certificates when necessary, from the ProvincialMedical SSrVle's officers plao,,- under the orders conveyed In this Department- letiter-of,: ihe 7th Pecem'ber 1937, will normally attend on such officers on payment and no separate payraMt in regpect of ;ihe certificates will be called for.

Subject:- Exclusion of service taxes from property tax, for the purposes of Fundamental Rules 4D-A and 45~B. Sir, I am directea to refer to ths amendments uo Fundamental Rules 45-A and 45-B, whicnwere publish ed in this Department 1 s xioti-Licauion N o . j ^ .^^(So 1 ) — R.1/31, dated the 4th December 1931. The effect of these amendments was to include municipal and other taxes of the nature of house and property tax in the standard rent of a building owned by Government, and to prescribe that an officer supplied with a residence by Government should pay, in addition to the rent, such municipal and 'Other taxes payable by Government as were not of the nature of house or property tax. 2. A question,has arisen whether, for the purposes of the Fundamental Rules, certain taxes of a service character which form part of a consolidated Corporation tax, locally Known as 'property tax f , are wo-be included in the standard, rent. I am to explain that it was tne intention of the rule-making'authority oiiat the term • 1 pro perty tax 1 , as used in the amendments reTerred to above, should be interpreted in the general sense and not in the technical sense assigned-to it in any particular act or code; and that it should therefore not be considered to include taxes levied for specific services rendered for tne benefit of tne....the occupier. Such taxes should in all cases he excluded from the standard rent and recovered from the occupier, irrespective of whether they by local rule or.'custom, payable in the first ■instance by the landlord or by the occupier. 3. I am accordingly to request that in the case of all Government servants under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State (whether serving under a * Provincial Government or under the Central Government) and in the case of all Government servants under the rule-making control of the Governor-General in Council, all taxes of a service character, such as water tax, ;drainage tax, and lighting tax, though they may be' included in a consolidated demand for property tax, should(if not alreadyy henceforthy done, be recovered separately from the occupier under clause lV(b)(ii) of Fundamental Rules 45-A or 45-B. 4. I am also to enclose a copy of the communications 1.

Railway Board# Pirst Class compartments reserved for High Officials of Government# In para 10 of Appendix 0 (at page 577) of the Indian Railways Conference Association Coaching Tariff No# II9 are detailed the officials c las s who are authorized to travel in a reserved ]?irsl/ compartment for which charges are debited to Government at public tariff rates# 2. Ordinarilyj the usual four-berthed compartment would be provided on requisition 9 but recently for certain specific journeys specially built and constructed coaches have been provided? for example? on the Howrah - Bombay run with (a) 'the Imperial Indian Mail which contains only one-berth or two^berth compartments? and (b) The Air-Conditioned Coach which contains two-berth end only one four-berth compartment? and? in addition to the ordinary First Class fare a surcharge is levied* Moreover? consideration would have to be given to cases where coupes are requisitioned on ordinary train services? which happen to cater for passengers in this respect* 5. In the event of a requisition being received for reservation of a compartment of one or two-berths by the Imperial Indian Mail or of a two-berth compartment by Air-Conditioned Coach? or of a coupe compartment on the ordinary train service? certain questions arise which are not covered by the existing rules, viz, (a) Are such one or two berth compartments to be treated on all fours for reservation purposes with the normal four berth com partments in the case of high r-.overhment officials within the intentions o.f the rules laid down by the Railway Board in the latter connection? (b) Regarding the payment of the Surcharge? and (c) Concerning the quantity of luggage allowed free. 4# As regards (a) it has been customary to confine the rules in practice as applying to the four-berth First Class compartment hitherto in general service on railways9 but I take it that there would be no objec0&gt;4 -non to their extension in principle to Cover oompartmenta of the nature referred to in paragraph 2 above. 5 . A S regards (b). viz. payment of the Surcharge, it is to be decided whether the additional amount involved will be paid by the Official concerned, or by Government, with the alternative of -ither entering the total amount ox fare plus Surcharge or showing each item separately in the Requisition form. 6. In regard to item (c), viz. concerning luggage, it tu-a b.^n accepted for several years that for luggage booked in tne six maunds are allowed free, and this would appear to have b 0 -n b-sod on a consideration of the free allowance applicable to four passenger. in a four berth compartment. 7. Recently, the Chief Justics of Bengal returned from England by the 'Markunda' and at Bombay presented through his Ag.n , Maokinnon Mackenzie and Co ., a P. &amp; 0. Coupon for one Sirst Class ticket to Howrah and a requisition for six maunds luggages his Agents also reserved a single berth compartment by Indian Mail# 8. The luggage that v^as booked weighed 5 raaunds 15 seers and free allowance of 1 maund 20 seers only was allowed on the First Class ticket held, and the Agents accordingly presented a bill of Rs.45/14/0 for the excess luggage, which his Lordship declined to pay and in a letter to the Agents at Bombay statedi- 'Sfith reference to your letter of February 7 and the reply of the Chief Traffic Manager of the Great Indian Peninsula Rail way I want to point out that I put in a requisition for ^ luag'ge space in the usual form under which I am entitleo. to six maunds of luggage carriage free. The fact that I the fare together with a supplement for travelling on tne .P.&amp; 0. Express is no reason why Government regulations should not operate'. 9, The Chief Traffic Manager, Great Indian Peninsula Railway, Borabayj in forwarding copies of correspondence to my Chief Commer cial Manager statess- 'Sir Harold Derbyshire has declined to pay this amount to the Shipping Agents Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie and Company statins that he was entitled to a 1st class four berto compartment and to a proportionate free allowance of luggage of 6 Mds.9 on the authority of the High Official Requisition ticket which he held, charges in connection with which would have been recovered from Government. Since he only occupied a single berth on the Imperial Mail, on which there are nofour berth compartments,, and as his far^ was covered by P. &amp; 0. Coupon Uo, 13721 p the High Official Requisition was not utilised and fcas oeen returned to him.- No claim can therefore be made against Government'. 10. It seems to me that on the same principle as would appear to govern the normal four berth compartment, free allowances in the Brake Van of 3 maunas and 1 mauod 20 seers would apply in the case of two berth send...orve berth respectively• 11. In the circumstances, I shall be obliged if the Board will kindly furnish me with their decisions in respect of the three questions that have arisen, as dettiled in paragraph 3 above, at their early con venience, :nd arrange to modify the existing rules, where necessary, in accordance with such decisions.p V Res.

To All Minor Local Governments. Subjects-Eligibility of non-Superior officers for passage concessions consequent on change of domicile after first appointment. Sir 9 A case has come to the notice of the Government of India in which a woman in Government service who was of non-Asiatic domicile at the time of her appointment and was admitted to the passage concessions for non-superior officers of non-Asiatic domicile married a person of Asia^tic domicile. The question has arisen whether she still retains her non-Asia.tic domicile and the benefit of the passage coiicessions resuluing therefrom of^tfeether .she .has acquired the domicile of ''■y ' ' her husband thus losing the passage concessions. , 2. Under rule 7 of the rules for the determination of the domicile of an officer contained in Appendix B to Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Services Rules s a woman after marriage, acquires the domicile of, her husband, if she had not the same domicile before and her domicile durirg marriage follows the domicile of her husband. According to this rule the Government servant in question has acquired her husband's domicile which is Asiatic. On the other hand, it may be inrerred from Regulation 2(h) o ■ the Passa-ge Rogulations in Schedule IV of the Superior Civil Services Rules that domicile at the time of appoint ment is the proper criterion. Further, under Rule 3 of the rules regulating the grant of Overseas jfey andRule '75-13 of the Fundamental Rules 9 no Government seirv^nt who.after his appointment to a service or post acquires a new domicile^ thereby loses his right to or becomes entitled to Overseas Pay or admission' to, the benefits of the special le^ve rulesj as the case WEsy be. It is considered the.t the same principle should hold good in the rules regarding the grant of passage concessions to non- superior officers of non-Asiatic domicile ano. the G-overnor General in Council isj therefoiej pleased tto decide th£it no officer^ who after nis or ner appointment to a service or post acquires a new domicile,.shall thereby lose his or her right to, * or become entitled to, pas sage benefits.
