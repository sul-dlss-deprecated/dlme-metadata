Discussed at length is the issue of ensuring the collection of customs and the registration of dhows at Aiqa.Most of the correspondence is between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Other notable correspondents include the following: the Secretary of State for India; the Commanding Officer at Air Headquarters, Iraq Command; Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], President of the Council of Ministers, and later Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah, Amir of Ja'alan [Emir of Ja‘lān] and Shaikh of Aiqa.Related matters of discussion include the following: the reported prolonged evasion of customs by the Bani Bu Ali in Aiqa; the level of assistance that should be provided by the British in order to help Muscat assert control in Sur and Aiqa (e.g. whether it is necessary to send HMS sloops to Sur); the interception of an Aiqa dhow by a Muscat State patrol vessel on 12 November 1931; preparations for 'punitive action' against Aiqa by the British – including a planned reconnaissance mission ahead of possible aerial bombardment, and discussion of naval bombardment – in the event of the Shaikh opposing the establishment of a customs post there.The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between the Political Agent, the Shaikh of Aiqa, and Saiyid Said bin Taimur (English translations are present in most cases).All the material dates from the period 1931-1932, with the exception of some brief notes at the end of the volume, which are dated November 1939.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>President of the Council of Ministers</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ja'alān</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Bū 'Alī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aiqa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial reconnaissance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
