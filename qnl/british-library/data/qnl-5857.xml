Dear 3 aggallay 3 Please refer to your letter or the 4th November (E.6199/465/91). You will have seen that on the 31st October (India Office letter No.P.Z.7320/38) we sent you a copy of Fowle’s letter of the 20th October reporting the reception given by the Sheikh of Koweit and his Council to the draft Bon Voisinage on Extradition treaties with Saudi Arabia which were communicated to them unofficially. I’k is good news that the body of both drafts was accepted, and that exception was taken by the Council (not altogether unexpectedly) only to the preambles, which as you know had been deliberat^iL drafted so as to emphasise the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government for the external relations of Koweit. The Council’s redraft reveals an unwillingness to acknowledge this position. It may not be a bad thing that the issue has arisen at this early stage of the Council’s existence, since if we can secure the acceptance of the formula of our drafts we 1 . naggallay, j&amp;sq. , shall/ Foreign Office, S. W. 1 .2 shall have gone a long way to clarify His Majesty’s Government’s position in the eyes of the Council. At the same time it is important that officially we should deal only with the Sheikh, particularly so in order to disabuse the Council of their pretensions (as indicated in Article 3 of the 'Inaugural Law') to authority in the sphere of Koweit’s external relations. (Please see in this connexion paragraph 2 of the letter No.P.Z.6062/38 which we sent to Powle on the 30th September after consulting you. I enclose a copy as it is not clear that a copy of the letter as issued was sent to you). 3. We do not much like some of the implications of Powle’s proposal that de Gaury should get the Sheikh ' to endeavour t o persuade the Council to withdraw their amendment '. We want, if possible, to avoid any impression that we recognise the Council as having any status giving them a deciding voice in a question of external affairs, though it Y/as quite natural and proper for the Sheikh to consult them on the substance of the draft treaties. We have therefore considered whether it would be better to proceed straight away to the stage of sending the Sheikh an official communication on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 of Powle’s letter, a step that/that must dg taken sooner or later ? and ask de Gaury to explain to him that the Council’s amendment is unacceptable to His Majesty's Government because of its failure to recognise their special position under which they control the foreign relations of Koweit 3 and to leave it to the Sheikh to deal with the Council as he thinks best^^^here is ? of course ? the risky whatever course is followed, that the Council may adhere to their views and that insistence on our formula may lead to an open conflict of opinion between the Council and the Sheikh in which we should naturally support the latter, but we must be prepared to face this situation. 4. The best course, however, especially in view of the urgency of getting the negotiation through, seem to be to leave it to Powle’s discretion to get the no •iif , . . . , . _ . _ Sheikh 1 s agreement m whatever way he considers to be mo st expeditious and least likely to lead, to trouble in 1 Koweit, r . ovided always that de Gaury in his approach to the Sheikh should not give the impression of attributing any executive authority to the Council in the matter. 5. We propose therefore, if you concur, to instruct4. I FovVle in the sense of the foregoing paragraph^ and we should 'be glad to have your views as early as possible. Yours sincerely ? (Sgd.) R.

If no report has yet been received as to the attitude of the Sheikh towards these agreements, would it be possible for a telegraphic enquiry to be addressed to the Political Resident? If only because of the increasingly serious situation with regard to smuggling from Koweit into Iraq (see our letter E 5705/75/91 of 19th October), it is clearly necessary that every effort should be made to push on towards the consummation of our efforts to raise the Saudi blockade Yours ever, (Sd) La cy B a ggal 1 ay * R.T.Peel, Esq*, M.C. rI ■ _ I I im&amp;igTe legre.m From Q. remal ndea?

'snd ^182 of hoveiiiber 30th. regarding the desire of ibn laud to see the proposed .^audi- uwsit agreement enter into force ae soon as possible. 2. The King raised the subject himself* snd this added to the interest of the fact that I had nmvtr before found the Jaudi authorities anxious that the agreement should be concluded soon. The King caid that his wish to conclude the Agreement was due portly to a recent increase in the amount of a ng ling on the daudi-Kuwait border* but mainly to 'he fact ^hat he wanted to wake customs and pi*e- ventive arrangements for the port of Lea ~'v nr a, and that the arrangements adopted there would depend to sore extent ■ ipon ..he her the proposed .■.greemoni with Kuwait as con cluded or not* This second of the two reasons may have sore weight in the King’s mind, but inee ;e had reason to expect that the establishment of a laudi port at Mae Tanura would make him even more indif erent o Kuwait as m port of entry for his territory* it seems probable that oih r causes too are at work* and it seems to me that anong them are the three set forth below* 3. It may be that the prospects of a as Tanure noiv seem less favourable ban when they were farther off. m s . harles .-ills, of the well-known fir of Gray Mackenzie end / Company igh f nourable the Viscouni Kalifox# *6.* c Grn Sec . &amp;w.who la at pr«a«nt in nogotla ing for par- iweion 'o eata •■lish nn office ®t imt: Ts/v.ra, consider© that the m%Ai hopes based on Mas Tssrmra h: ve be n far igher than the ircu ©taaces ever w» &lt; ranted. : ie believes that hey have even at times envisaged dgm Tanurs as an enormous entrepot serving as a port of transit for Bahrain and thus reversing the present position so galling to I bn baud| whereas in his opinion there is no red to have whsrve* and warehouse® at Mas fenure or indeed to land cargo there at alii it can best be used# he maintains* aa a deep-water anchorage where tankers can take $&amp; oil from the bees oil field, and cargo for usudl Arabia can be transhipped into barges for despatch under tow to Al Khubar and elsewhere, for 'he oil field, and to bqslr, for ~iofuf and iyadh. It is interesting in this connection to quote i^ad Bey Hams, who returned from Iraq, via Kuwait, while I was at Kiyadh. He spoke of the nearness of Kuwait to Kiyadh by car, and pointed out that for s person travelling from tviyadh by car, it took no longer to reach Basra, with its air-lines connecting with urope and the ast, than Hofuf* This is true, and the traveller at nofuf is still a diffi cult day’s journey by car from Mas Tenure. It nmy be, then, that the Saudi authorities recognise that even if Ha® Taiaira can be made into a good port, it is not very convenient as to situation# 2m I bn aaud is also wo... ried abouirnqi design© on Kuwait - another s .bjeet which he brought up during my visit# I. have reasons for believing that Kuwait would not easily be swell owed up by Iraq, but the ‘ing may think that the position of Kuwait would be b ranger if he tied signed the proposed agrsemsnt, which would tend to show that / Saudi\ * } N b Saudi Arabia arid not Iraq, ie the proper hinterland of uwait. is natur ®3. that ibn Saud should not want to see | hia territory shut off from Kuwait by the relatively power- j ful state of Iraq* o. 'innlly ( -bn 3sud may wish to see the personal position of the Shaikh of Kuwait strengthened. He sjcoke to me one day shout the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain - his traditional connection with them, his personal sympathy with them as fellow Arab rulers, and his regret at recent I events whicn might have damaged their prestige, ©eg. the riot in Bahrain, w ich he attribu ed to Persian machina tions, and the appointment in Kuwait of a council composed of elements which were not all, he thought, of the highest quality, tie said that he apologised if he was stepping outside his jurisdiction (I had indeed made some deprecating remarks), biu he felt very strongly on the subject* It seemed to ne that he King felt that\hls own position was affected by the re ent constitutional change in Kuwait, and thought it was time for Arab rulers to help one another. 4* whatever the motives behind the King’s request for the speedy conclusion of the proposed ^ greement, I hope, as I said In the second of the two sbove-mentioned telegrams, that we shall seize the opportunity* 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to Hie ? ajes- ty*» Ambassador at Bagdad (Ho.2591/381/24), The Honourable j the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (Ho.2592/ 381/24) and the Political Agent at Kuwait (Ho*2593/381/24)• 1 I h ve the honour to be, with the highest respect, i y Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant.

H© mentioned the recent estab lishment of the council at Kuwait* and said there was some thing at aibai too* I said there was slavery at liubai, I believed, and as to the implication that we were trying to increase our influence at Kuwait by backing m council, it seemed as though we could never do rights if we supported a shaikh we were tyrants, indifferent to the general wel fare, and if we appeared to favour a council, it *as because the shaikh had stood up for his independence* Fuad did not argue the case, and it did not scorn to m that he bellevjd very firmly in hia theory, but he may have been working on the mind of t he king, who in any case i® known to resent being * hemmed in” by the Arab states, with all of whom we are in special relations* fiills will get some sort of agreement in the end, I think, but it is difficult work.

D• 0 .Mo. 0-6 My dear Sir Trenchard, His Highness informs me that he is writing, in about two days time, to inform me that he accepts the draft Saudi Bon-Yiosanage and Extradition Agreements complete as they stand. Why he is delaying a little is because he wishes to make some suggestions in connection with the Agreements. One is about hunting over the frontier by himself and members of the Subah family, and the other is the virtual impossibility of guaranteeing that there nay not be some passing over the frontier of goods going from hand to hand in the tribes. I will give you my views about these two, and any other point he raises, when I receive them but it looks as if they can, if necessary, be dealt with in an explanatory letter, and no alteration whatever need be made in the Agreements. I thought you would like to have this advanced information • I will telegraph briefly when I receive his official letter. e Sir Trenchard Fowls, « * ical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

(c) That reference Article 9 of HON 70ISINACE A.greement, provision should he made to cover hunters and messengers who may want to cross frontier. 2. Ky comments are:- (a) See Minister Jedda’s telegram March 25, 1938. (h) This is a matter for Saudis, hut cooperation between the frontier officers could avert cases of hardship. Saudi OrOvernraent may wish to make an addition to Article 1 paragraph (d) of Trade Agreement to cover their action in such auch cases. (c) So long as hunters or messengers have a letter of authority from a Saudi superior official or the Sheikh of Kuwait in every case they might he permitted to cross. This could he made clear in mi a letter at the time of signature.Translation of letter No.R-6/1122 dated 12th January 1939 from His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jahir as-Suhah, K.C.I.3., Kuler of Kuwait, to Captain Gr.S.de G-aury, Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments. In reply to your letter 3&gt;1 January 1939 forwarding therewith copies of Agreements for the friendship and Good Neighbourly Relations, for the Extradition of Offenders and for the Re-organisation of Trade between the Government of Saudi Arabia, on the one hand, and Kuwait, on the othe?, I beg to inform you that I have gone through these Agreements, and I am very glad that the political and economical relations of the two brotherly States should be put on this clear basis, which will strengthen and cement their friendly relations with which they were and are still connected, and help to the continuance of good understanding between them. The efforts made by the Representatives of His Majesty’s Government in this matter deserve appreciation and gratitude. These efforts strengthen the mutual friendly and cordial relations which exist between His Majesty’s Government and their Arab friends. There are some observations which I wish to point out to you, as although these observations are non-essential to the Agreements, yet I consider that they should be touched upon-. (1) paragraph (a) of Article 1 of the Trade Agreement says in respect of goods exported from Kuwait by land, 'Any person who is not with a caravan shall be regarded as a smuggler, even if he has a manifest. 'What/- A 0 &lt;C/-ia of 5th- 2 - TThat is raeant 'by the word ’Caravan* ? .That number can properly he called with this name? Here the minimum limit for the number of caravan peonle is to he fixed so that there will he no complications in regard to this point in future, ( (2) Paragraph (d) of the same Article. 'Persons entering Kuwait territory from Saudi Arabia to buy goods for their own consumption mist travel in parties and conform to the conditions laid down on commercial caravans.' Although this paragraph can easily he applied to the townsmen, its application to the bedouins of the desert will cause great confusions and difficulties for them, as it is not easy for them to collect and form a caravan owing to their speediy movements and numerous residences and destinations. To this may he added the fact that their own requirements are nearly always unworthy and of a low cost. (5) It is desirable that the free movement defined in Article 9 of the Agreement for the promotion of Priendly and Good Heighbouly Relations Between the Two States, should cover those who move on both sides of the frontiers for hunting and hakwing as well as the messenger who goes to a fixed destination in order to collect a debt owed to him by anyone on the other side of the frontier or any other personal business. Article 9 should, therefore, apply to the hunters and messengers as far as free movement is concerned. These are my observations which I am submitting w to you Usual Ending.CONFIDENTIAL .

At the risk of some repetition I now furnish a brief report on Ibn Sand's- general attitude towards the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf* It is well known that he has always resented his dependence on Bahrain if not on Kuwait as well, that he despises tne smaller shaikhs, and that he considers that the policy of Li s Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the Persian Gulf has the effect of hemming him inc During the last year or two various new factors have been introduced into the problem* the discovery of oil in various A ra b territories; the increase in the influence of Iraq; movements in Arab territories which for conven ience can be described as democratic; and the real or simulated belief in some Arab circles that His Majesty's Government are engaged in a 'forward movement' in the Gulf; and it will be convenient to make a brief survey of / the ie Light Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K,G,, &amp; c i A c 0 Ac,the whole position in the light of these new factors. 2- r £hc personal respect which Ihn Saud has for His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain was shown when the Crown Prince of S-udi Arabia visited Bahrain a year ago and on the occasion of the return visit of the shaikh to the Hejaz shortly afterwards. ' lie Bing, when speaking to me about the visit, praised the Shaikh as an excellent man, and moreover of the sa rn e tribal origin as himself, v/hile the Amir Saud snoke of t ln c difference between the Shaikh and the other Arab rulers, whcm he described as rather Boeotian- During my recent visit to Riyadh Ibn Baud spoke with con ern about the Shaikh, v/hose position he considered was endangered by the Persian intrigues which in his opinion had caused the recent agitation. He became quite animated in his sympathy. There was the Sub a r a question too, he said* that remained open- T said I thought this question nad been settled (I did not say that the decision of His Majesty’s Government was not to support the Bahrain claim), cut thu King said it was by no means settled. -‘-His has th^ fir^.t reference to the Cubana question since the conversation with Fuad Hamza which I reported in my despatch Ho. 18 \(222/469/3) of February 1st., 1938, except that some months ago one of the 1 ecca nev/spapers printed an obscure paragranh which did n^t mention Cubara by name but referred to what could only be the Cubara dismite and alleged that it had been exacerbated by the discovery of oil at the place concerned- 3- If there was nothing novel in the King s praise of the Shaikh of Bahrain on this recent occasion, to hear him praise the Shaikh of Kuwait was certainly quite new. Hitherto we have always been given to understand that he / regardedregarded the Shaikh as the leader 'f a gang of smugglers responsible for the loss of an immense annual revenue to Saudi Arabia• how, however, d was told of the tradition al bonds between ibn Saud and Kuwait, and assured of his desire for the maintenance of the Shaikh s position and dignity, and was asked to eynedite the conclusion of that Saudi-Kuwaic Agreement for which he had previously shown so little enthusiasm. A year or two years ago the °aut al Hejaz' would not have published the article on Kuwait which appears in the issue of December 6th. This article begins' 'Kuwait is a pure Arab country distinguished by its mildness and tranquility. i ts peoole are known for their Arab nobility of character, which they have in herited from their honourable ancestors'. In my above- -mentioned despatch I tried to nrevide some explanation for this change of attitude, and suggested as the prin cipal causes a growing realisation that Kas Tanura may be less successful than was hoped; suspicion of iraci; and apprehension at the movement in Kuwait which has resulted in the establishment if a.council to assist in the government of that territory. It is early to give a decided oninicn about Has Tanura, and it might perhaps be lustiftable to draw the opposite conclusion, viz. that who possession of a port of his own made Ibn Saud believe rbat few if any imports wouldmw come in through Kuwait; but it is certain that tee ether two considerations have ban some influence on Ibn laud's mind. The course of ev ents in Kuwait has not been in accordance with his con ception of constitutionax procedure in an Arab and a I’oslem state. Gome time age be told me that he linhon-d / 4-r to the advice of his 'people and then governed in accord ance with the principles of Islam? and he assented to my suggestion that his country was under a religious con stitution. there is no doubt that although he takes his own decisions he does listen to the opinions of the ulama. and of the tribal shaikhs; hut he thinks it wrong that the Shaikh of Kuwait should have to listen to a ,( self- -annointed' council containing elements which? in Ibn baud's opinion, are far from having the necessary pres tige or position. But? says Ibn baud? it would have been quite proper for the Shaikh to summer men of position to form a council and to ask their advice * 4. I must repeat that Ibn S a ud apologised, when I made some deprecating remark, for speaking about the in ternal affairs of Bahrain and Kuwait* and explained that he was thinking of his own position whi&lt;°h might be affected by that of his neighbours. bo Ibn S a ud was indignant at what he had heard of Iraqi designs on Kuwait. ^he efforts made by the Iraq Government this year to draw tighter the commercial? finan cial and military bonds with Saudi Arabia have not weakened his suspicions? and their desire to have a port at Kuwait - perhaps as a prelude to absorption - is the last straw. He did not refer to Iraqi propaganda elsewhere? but it was no doubt present to his mind, for Arabic newspapers have referred more than once to the populations of the minor Arab states in the Gulf as looking towards Iraq. Ibn S a ud's jealousy of Iraq has been exacerbated recently by the rather flamboyant statements made by the Iraqi Minister for foreign Affairs about Palestine on his return from London, and just as he w- ’'.pyin ' ■ &gt; to pr v- y- bv els p ogot is times me / connectionconnection with the forthcoming -London discussions? that? has as he/claimed in so many words? it is he and not ''certain others’' who is the leader of the A ra i 3 world, so he may he wishing to counteract Iraqi influence in the Gulf try con cluding the K uwa it Agreement? thereby enhancing the posi tion of the Shaikh and emphasising the importance of the relations between Kuwait and haudi Arabia. 6. Ibn S 8 ud made no reference to the minor Arab fillers during my visit to Riyadh? but I’uad Hamza asked me, obviously on instructions and with much earnestness, about the uossibility of a solution of the eastern frontier dif ficulty,. Moreover when the Ki n g was deprecating hostile action against the Yemeni forces in S/abwa, Ruad said that our action would inevitably be linked up in the public mind with what' is regarded os our 'forward policy' in the Persian Gulfh hhen called uuon to define this policy he could only say that some Arabs attributed the establish ment of the council in Kuwait to the British, who had found the Shaikh too independent and desired to have a more subservient instrument? and refer to a movement in the direction of councils in some of the minor shaikh- doms.. kuad did not pretend that he himself held any such belief, and admitted that he had brought back from Kuwait? where he stayed on his way from Bagdad? a more reasonable theory; but it is admitted that His Kajesty’s Government have thought it necessary to extend and strengthen their control in the Hadhramaut, and Arabs cannot be blamed if they look for signs of a similar nrocess nearer home. Ibn Sard has no love for the minor shaikhs, least of all for the Shaikh of Qatar? but a general movement towards the / reductionreduction of the stntus of A ra -b rulers could not he -pleas ing to bin. Ais low opinion of the young men in the Hejaz who are supposed to desire the modernisation of S au dx Arabia has been expressed more than once, and he would naturally regret the appearance a-*- his door, in however rudimentary a form, of a system which he is resolved mot to see established in ^is own country. 7. ■ inaliy, in suite of his' general desire to work with is i'aiesty's Government, and of his assertion that, on grounds of security, he would rather have the British as his neighbours than the Amir Abdullah or the Irsq,G;ev- ernment, he would certainly not welcome an increase in n 1 a ..t.hfi British control in the territories of his Arab neighbours/ Be must be well aware of the tendency of European control in eastern countries to spread, and of. the keenness of the competition for oil-bearing lands, and the unfortunate course of the laba! Nakhsh affair seems to have - caused him to believe that our policy in the Persian Gulf is in fluenced by oil interests. I do not doubt therefore that in conversation with Nr. ^enahan he did shovr some reluct ance to allow a British firm to establish themselves at Pas T anura, which is to be the pert for the shipment of hesa oil. In the end the unique position which Messrs. Gray Mackenzie already hold in the Gulf, and the facilities which they are consequently in a position to offer, should enable them to secure the permission they require, but they will have much suspicion to live down. It is to be expected that Ibn Baud’s attitude towards them will, be influenced not only by what happens in the Gulf, but by the result of the a ondon discussions on Palestine and even Perhaps by the / outcomecutcome of the Anglo-Yemeni dispute about Shabws and A-b r . Our position will be none the easier if, as is reported 'toy L is I-a iesty s -^mb assy at ; iagdad ? there is to be a German mission at Jedda, unless the Germans are sc foolish as to overdo their nropaganda - a great mistake where Ibn Saud is concerned^ It is to be hoped that the hansa bine, who are said to have been making strenuous efforts to estab lish themselves at Bahrain, will not succeed ip their attempt to obtain permission to extend their activities to the mainland. It is certain that the California Arab ian Standard ^±1 Comuany are well content with the ser vices rendered by essrs.

In view of desire of Saudi Arabian Government to conclude Agreement as soon as possible would you see any objection; in order to save time; to communicating to the Sheikh forthwith the draft Bon Voisinage and Extradition treaties in- English and in Arabic; with an explanation that the Arabic translation is provisional; and to asking him whether he desires that His Majesty’s Government should now proceed on his behalf to negotiate; and subsequently conclude; agreements with the Saudi-Arabian Government on the basis of the drafts, on the understending that he would be prepared to observe the provisions of such agreements as likewise those of the proposed trade agreement. The finally approved Arabic translation would be communicated to him in due course and he would of course be consulted again if any alterations in the drafts were required as a result of the negotiations with the Saudi-Arabian Govern ment . The position with regard to the tradevagreement appears to be (vide your express letter of the 10th August; 1937) that the Sheikh has agreed to the terms of the draft agreement; subject \ to the condit .on mentioned in his letter of the 3rd August; 1937; and has also agreed to it being embodied in an Anglo-Saudi exchange/exchange of notes. But before the agreement can be concluded both sides will doubtless wish to be satisfied with the lists of easterns posts reruired to complete Article 7. Foreign Office will oe ashed to ascertain names of proposed Baudi posts. Can you similarly ascertain what Koweit posts are proposed by Sheikh ? i !

In the second parsgrap of article 1 , the words 'Persons entering Kowait territory 'from Saudi Arabia and taking out goods, etc.'* read &lt; a if these persons were taking goons from daudi Arabia to ICoweit. It is, however, obvious that the para; raph refers to persons who enter Koweit territory to buy supplies and take those supplies back with them to Saudi Arabia. thin;:, therefore that to make the meaning clearer these words should be amended to read* 'Persons entering Koieit territory fro Saudi Arabia and leaving again it goods.: bought, etc.'.

I spoke to Shaikh Yusuf Yasin a few days ago in the sense of this letter, pointing out that we had refrained from interfering in the internal policy of the shaikhs, and that the establishment of administrative councils at Kuwait and Dubai had been due to disregard of out advice to set up advisory councils to act as safety valves. Yusuf Yasin said that the King had a double interest in the matter: he did not wish anything to happen which would expose His Majesty’s Government to criticism, and he wished the personal position ol the shaikhs to he maintained Yusuf Yasin has doubtless repeated to Ibn Saud what I told him, hut he has not sent any comment. During the last few days I have been discussing the Baxter Esq.., M.C. , oreign Office. / KuwaitKuwait Agreements with Shaikh Yusuf, and I took the opportunity to point out how very much Saudi policy towards Kuwait during the last few years had weakened the King's position as between Saudi Arabia and Iraq.. The Iraq, propaganda for the annexation of Kuwait had drawn from the King the quite accurate statement that Kuwait meant more to Saudi A r abia than tdj Iraq; but suppose Iraq said that as Saudi Arabia had got on without Kuwait for so long, she had proved that Kuwait was of no interest to her? But I have no doubt that Ibn Saud's suspicions of Kuwait, both as a hbme for smugglers and as a possible source of political intrigue, have been very strong, and they are not necessarily weaker now: only, the other consideration which I suggested in the despatch on #hich Powle has commented would seem to have tipped the balance the other way.

My Lord, In accordance with the instructions whiclc I had the honour to receive from you in your telegram No.. 29 dated March 1 st., I have discussed with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, who was appointed by Ibn Saud for the purpose, the drafts of the proposed Bon Voisinage and Extradition agreements bet ween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Copies of the Arabic text which the Saudi Government would like to see accepted, together with a translation in English, and notes on the above-mentioned agreements and on the Trade Agreement, are being sent to Bushire and Kuwait for detailed con- sideration. Herewith I transmit copies of the English translation and of the notes. 2. During the discussions with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin tuo or three questions of form were raised on which I should he glad to have your instructions. These questions are set forth in paragraphs 3 , 4 and 5 below. was stated in paragraph 4 of Foreign Office telegram No. 22, dated February 5th., that appropriate draft preamble and termination clauses would be sent, biese clauses have not reached me, and I have therefore made use, in the discussions with Shaikh Yusuf, of the preambles to the Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements as drafted at Kuwait. / 4. Light Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G.,4. It will be remembered that the Saudi Government asked, when the negotiations began, that His Majesty's Government should guarantee the execution of the Trade Agreement. It is now clear that they expected the pro cedure to be that followed in the case of the Bon Voisinage Agreement with Trans-Jordan, where His Majesty's Government did n0t sign the ' j reat y» tmt letters were annexed in which it was made clear that His Majesty's Government accepted responsibility for the fulfilment of the provisions of the Treaty by the Amir of Trans-Jordan. On finding that the agreements with Kuwait would be signed by His Majesty's Government, the Saudi Government suggested the deletion of the main portion of Article 1 (2) of the draft Bon Voisin age Agreement as superfluous. To this deletion there will, I suppose, be no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government or of His Highness the Shaikh, but there is a connected point on which I am doubtful. The Saudi Govern ment suggest that in the phrase in the preambles 'acting in_cheir_p wn name and on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait', the words here underlined are superfluous as expressing a guarantee which they new consider implied by the fact that the agreements will be signed by a repres- % entative of His Majesty’s Government; Hut I am not sure whether their assumption is correct, or whether the words are not essential in view of the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government for the foreign affairs of Kuwait. 5-. The Saudi Government propose that the agreements shall he drawn up in Arabic only. They quote as precedents the Bon Voisinage agreements with Iraq and Trans-Jordan, / andand they have a strong preference for the use of Arabic alone; but they will not make concession on this point a condition of signature. ihe two most difficult points proved to loe the definition of political offences, and the question whether any categories of persons could he allowed to cross the ircntier without passes of some kind. Notes on these points will he found in the appropriate enclosures to this despatch The movements of hunters, to which reference was made in your ahove-mentioned telegram, is to he covered, the Saudi Government suggest, hy an oral 'Gentlemen’s Agreement'.

(3) The Saudi Government propose as definition of a 1 ? caravan H : one motor-vehicle or three animals. They con tend no hardship would be caused with the minimum so low&gt; for no individual would have to wait long for a 1 caravan to assemble. (4) The Saudi Government cling tenaciously to their asser tion that to allow persons from the Saudi side of the frontier to enter Kuwait territory on the pretext of musabala (purchase of goods)? without requiring them to have permits from the Saudi authorities, would encourage smuggling and nullify the safeguards proposed. xhe relevant provision is embodied in Article 11, which covers all cases of crossing the frontier except that of the hunter but perhaps it would be well to repeat the provision in the Trade Agreement.

(9) In Article 9 the words 'or musabala' have been omitted, as the Saudi Government consider that it would stultify the agreements if any person, was allowed to cross the frontier -vhout permission by merely alleging that he was going to na'ie purchases.

The Saudi Government say that this amendment is inserted in the interests of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose followers include a number of Saudi nationals. Thej declare that they themselves have nothing to gain by . the amendment, which so far as they are concerned can be struck out, (12) Article 11 of the Jedda draft is intended to cover all cases of crossing the frontier? except that of the huntero ihn Saud does not wish to state in writing that persons engaged in hunting may cross the frontier without rj permission? hut he has sent word to me through Shaikh lusuf Yasin that this would he winked at under an oral / ’'Gentlemen’s Agreement”, ^ ^ | / (13) Article 11 (2) provides for the despatch of officials j as messengers to Kuwait or Riyadh# Such persons are to he allowed to cross the frontier with permission from the other Government provided they are ”authorised” hy their own Government, The Saudi Government do not wish to define 'authorised” more exactly? because, they say? this paragraph / only // x ■■t ' X only records m writing a practice which is already working ^ perfectly well, and I suggest that this accommodating ' spirit is to he v/elcomed. : Article 11 ' re ^ uires the person who wishes to make ^/purchases over the frontier to get a pass from Ms own side. This provision will he unwelcome to the Government of Kuwait, hut it is regarded as essential hy the Saudi Government. (15) The Saudi Government propose that the operation of Article 12 should he restricted to foreigners, since the movements of nationals are governed hy Article 11 as given in the Jedda draft. This seems logical. (1 6 ) Only the A r ahic language is mentioned in the Jedda draft. On this point see the covering despatch. The schedule , (IT) Paragraph 2 (Ara’if) is just as it has been drafted ty Shaikh Yusuf, who asserts that it represents exactly the arrangement at present in force between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. His Majesty’s Legation did not notice until Yusuf Yasin had left Jedda that his draft mentioned only camels, not animals in general. (I®) Paragraph 4 of the Schedule provides that if a murder is intentional the penalty shall he the execution of the offender, not the payment of blood money. The Saudi Govern ment claim that this is the procedure which is followed in all cases in Saudi territory. They recently objected 'because blood money was paid to the relatives of a Saudi national who had been murdered deliberately in Trans-Jordan 'by Trans-Jordan nationals and said that the murderers should / havehave 'been executed, it ws-a + l3B P 01 nted out to them that the decision was in accordance with the m 11 Lfie -Blood-Money provision in the Schedule to the Tn^mc.-.T^v^ ^ne irans-Jordan Bon Voisinage Agreement and they evidentlv wish to ou-tru r. + e. lauU misl mderstanding between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on this point. His Majesty's Legation consider that in principle the Saudi Government arc right. It will he noticed that the calculation of the blooc money is to he eifected according to the Sharia. (19) In paragraph 7 of the Schedule in the Jedda draft the Saudi Government have inserted a list of the tribes they claim as theirs, and they ask that a list of the Kuwait tribes should be added* ( 20 ) Article 8 in the Jedda draft has been added by Shaikh tusuf, who states that this also simply records in writing a well-known and accepted principle* The title 'Losses*' nas :b0en P ut in inverted commas in the English translation because it is alleged to be the accepted term for property ^usually in animals) which disappears, whether it has been lest or stolen. The drafting is not very good, but perhaps it is near enough for the purpose.XLiIlclOSUPS No • 3 in Js cLcIq Hpo-rin'hoVi &gt;1 despatch No. 51 dated March 19th 1939. Notes on th^ draft Extradition Agreement (March 8 th. 1939) (1) The question of political c r i m es (Article 3 ) has glven m ch trouble. The Saudi Government say that nothing should he left to the courts, since Sharia lawyers have as many opinions as there are individuals as to what constitutes a political offence. At first they wished to include all offences 'against the government authorities' among the non-extradit able offences, but in the end they replaced this phrase by the words against the local authorities' which they had found in Article 6 of the extradition treaty between Iraq and Egypt (a copy of this article is attached to this note) . They claim that in this matter Iraq had granted hotter terms to Egypt than to Saudi Arabia, and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin went 4o far as to allege that Iraq had refused to widen the scope of the term 'political offence' in the extradition treaty of 1930 with the deliberate intention of sheltering as many criminals from Saudi Arabia as possible. Ibn Saud appears to be determined that Kuwait shall not be used in this ¥/ay. But the words 'local authorities' are rather vague. Shaikh Yusuf gives as examples resistance to the police or the frontier guards&lt; Smuggling is included in the list of offences, in Article for which extradition shall be granted, but it is explained in the draft letters attached that this only applies to the case where a suspected smuggler who is not a Kuwaiti escapes from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait territory.' 4 (3) A second pair of drqft + ^ aralt letters explair^that offences commonly committed by the hprin-}^ i-&gt; ^ ne bedui n shall not he considered / political offences. These draftc; -p^ii aralts follow closely letters annexed to the Saudi-Iraq Extradition Treaty of 1930. (4) The Saudi Government have propped the excision of Article 4(2) in the Kuwait draft, which requires that all the documents included in the demand for extradition shall hear the seal of the competent authority. Their argument is that this does not suit the Saudi form of administration, and that since the demand will he presented ty the Govern ment of Saudi Arabia or the Government of Kuwait, which will stand responsible for it, the matter of seals on individual documents is of no importance. It is true that the courts have no independence in such matters here, but if it is desired to restore the provision about seals, we could quote a similar provision in the Saudi-Iraq Extradition Treaty. (5) Article 5 in the Jedda draft is new: it has been inserted at the request of the Saudi Government t Provision. It seems a useful*• 4 ^ * •’ — m W 0 (Jedda draft, March 6th., 1939). i+JULzi Agreement of Friendship and Bon Voisinage between the 6 audi Arabian Kingdom and the Amirate of Kuwait* j b-w cy - *) &amp; * ju cHJ-i The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North ern Ireland (hereinafter called the Government of the United Kingdom)» acting on behalf of His Highness the BhaiKh of Kuwait, of the one part, and the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, of the o ner part, being desirous of con firming the relations of friendship and bon voisinage which, happily, have subsisted from of old between the King of the Saudi Arabian King dom and the Amir of Kuwait, between their respective families, and between the territory of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and Kuwait, have ^ „ f'l ^ ur* ^**&lt;—“^* &lt; W ?: J aj ointed representatives for this purpose: JUJ ijuS UJ j Ij-*J who, having examined their creden tials and found them to be in good and due form, have agreed as follows: ij U I 6-* J IjulJ^ I Lwj I&amp;JmM ] ULz *Juk LwJi j U, i ^ L* t ^ Lw [ • A»-i» c5 j** ^ £y* X-*. ■ Xli ♦ s^ysJ IS-Laa*- —Jg ♦ t ^ U^JU J5 ^JU 0 !

There is also the TITfATA (15 houses) section of the ANAIZA hut without a Shaikh and they follow H.A.IR. , hi!Reference paragraph 7 of Sciiedule to B.7. Agreement. I don’t kno'tf if there is a 'catch” in the hit about tr ibe s s ubject to the S^udi Arabian Government. T see they mention ATAIBA and then go on to say that some ATAIBA are under dispute with the Iraq_ Govern ment. The miBA in Iraq, are as far as I know only the IKHWAN refugees - indivi duals not tribal sections. Kuwait has traditional right over the KUTAIR (no doubt this would be violently contested by His Majesty) There are some HUTAIR in Kuwait - as individuals. There are many KASHAYIDA, and Awazim and some Ajman. I suggest we might say HOT TRIBES . but TRIBES’CEN subject to the Kuwait Government include men of the RASHAYIGA and Awazim, with also some originally from the HUT AIR, Anaiza and Ajaan tribes. The use of Tribesmen instead of tribes may placate the King on this sort of point which is just the kind which he would lecture upon and be very obstinate about. The Shaikh of Kuwait (though not paying subsidies) has gradually lost most of this tribesmen and certainly cannot claim to rule any of these tribes, as tribes, but he should, I think, not admit to have no tribesmen, and the Saudis seem to envisage that he has some and will be filling in the blanks at the bottom of paragraph 17 . Sd. G.S. de Gaury. 11.5.39. If His Hajesty starts claiming all individuals in~2” Kuwait 'by origin of the tribes subject to him then the whole thing will be held up indefinitely in a wrangle, about definition of ♦n ati onali ty * I should therefore give him as little excuse as possible. An alternative might be to say f, There are no com plete tribes under the Huler of Kuwait at the present time'. N.B. There are few complete tribes anywhere. Nearly all have sections split off in the neighbouring country.*?.S.

Finally, as you are aware, the intends visiting Bin SaUd shortly and any final might well be got over by personal and informal course between the Shaikh and Bin Saud, as Arab Arab.

Shaikh agreed that definition of caravan should apply to traders but objected to it being applied to individuals coming for musabala. The Shaikh did not make himself clear on the point as to his exact reasons for his object ion. It was the Shaikh himself who suggested that the minimum for caravans should be small JL /^7 vide his letter No.^/5/593 of 3/8/37 to Political Agent, Kuwait, and the Saudi Government /Government have met him on this point. The Shaikh has, moreover, agreed that persons ooming for musahala should he under the same restrictions as traders see \rticle 1 of the draft Trade Agreement to which he agreed in his letter just quoted. (d) (1) Article 11 (5) of Bon Toisinage Agreement, see Jedda telegram No.65 of 17th Hay to the Foreign Office. The Shaikh was strong ly of opinion that individuals coming for musahala should not he required to take out permits. His argument was that the Saudi Government would not give permits and there fore this would prevent musahala of this kind. (2) As I understand it the present situation which has lasted about a year is that Bin Saud without any public anounoement to that effect has relaxed his blockade somewhat by allowing persons to come to Kuwait for musabala. This point could be checked in our next conversation with the Shaikh. (3) I asked the Shaikh in connection with (o) what six© of the caravans which might come for musabala was, to which he replied 'up to 70 or 80 camels'. This shows that the amount of this kind of musabala is large and it is, I imagine, by these musabala parties that most of the smuggling is carried out. Therefore, from the Saudi point of view, it is this musabala which has to be checked*(e) Finally the Sahikh said that the people who made difficulties on the Saudi side were not Yusuf Yasin and Co., and/lhn Saud f and that if he, the Sahikh, had a personal interview with Ybn Saud, he could proha'bly arrange matters amicably. i am inclined to think there is something in this. Sci. T*C.FOTtS Kuwait. 25th May 1939. ■I r”') Translation of letter No.H/6-1181 dated 25th May 1939 from H.H.Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait, to the Hon* ole sir Trenohard Fowle,KCIS., CBS., Politicial Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments. Reference our conversation on the subject of the Agreements proposed to be made with the Government of Saudi Arabian Kingdom, i.e. , (1) Agreement of Friendship and Bon Voisinage, (2) Extradition Agreement and (3) Trade or Musabala Agreement. I have studied these Agreements and the Schedules attached thereto very carefully. It has really become clear to me that all the articles of these Agreements are equitable and indicate mutual confidence. I am very fond of anything that strengthens my relations with my neighbours, especially the haudi Arabian Kingdom, and it also gives me great pleasure to enter into such agreements if they are in conformity with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. Now I wish to roaice certain observations summarily and not in detail, as they seen to be essentail for all. (1) Article 1 of the Extradition Agreement says:- ■*The Government of Kuwait undertakes to surrender to the Government of the laudi Arabian Kingdom any peiscn in the territory of the Ami rate oi Kuwait who is a national of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom or of a third State ana who has committed within the boundaries of that Kingdom any of the crimes mentioned in Article 3. (2) The Schedule to the Extradition Treaty, in explaining acts of smuggling, says as f.allows ^ person in iiaudi territory is suspected of ha/ing brought in goods from KUvvai u in contravention of the Musabala agreement between the two Governments and he escapes/-escapes into &amp;awr it territory, the competent authorities in Kuraiit, on receipt of news thereof, shall arrest the person and seize eny goods in his possession. It he is a Kuwait national, the Kuwait authorities shall take the necessary action in regard to hi it; if he 1 3 not a Kuwait national, the y sha 11 surrender_ him to t he Sa udi aut horities with the goods foun d in hi s po ssession .” * (5) 'ilie penultimate paragraph of Article 6 of the .agreement of friendship ana Bon Voisinage contains a sentence similar to that of the Extraction Agreement, (4) The Schedule to the agreement of Friendship contains the Homes of the tribes belonging to the Saudi Arabian Kinguom. (b) It is necessary to examine certain stipulations in the Trade Agreement very carefully as they considerably affect the custom and usage observed in the Arabian d desert, but at the same time do not oppose the sense of the agreement; they conflict with the form, ana not the sense, of the Agreements. Although 1 am quite prepared to show leniency, as fax* as I can, towards my neighbour, the baudi Arabian Government, i find that it may not be eaay to carry out the contents of the articles referrec. to in my letter, as it is easy and within my power to tal® action against any person of my subjects if ha contravenes the terms of the Agreement and its articles. It is similarly easy to tend over any person who is a national of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom if he commits an act which is in contravention of the Agreement. But it is very difficult to use this word as a general tern, as the offender might be a national of a third State, here I wish to know what the proper definition of this'third St at« is. Is this State known? Is it in treaty relations with the Saudi Arabian Government or with me or does it mean a mere State only? Th is/—i This is what refers to articles 1,2,and 3 of this le tt er • As reg rds article 4 which deals with the nfunes of tribes, this jbeint is worthy of consideration, as roany of these tribes, especially Ajiaan, Mutair, Rashayeda, Awazim, Tawatihah of Anaza and certain clans of other tribes, dwell in Kuwait territory and are considered to be Kuwait subjects and their life is connected with this Amirate economically, materially, politically and morally. As regards Article 3 dealing with Musabala, this article is not free from oindings in form more than in sense. I, therefore, wish them to be modified, as such modification might remove certain difficulties that might stand in the way of same of the poor Arabs who frequent the town either individually or in small groups, to purchase certain necessities for their own living, as tho application of a strict commercial regulation to them while they are of no importance, will cause certain complications to the nature of the regulations and arrangements referred to in the said Agreement. My only hope is that my desires may be fulfilled through the help of His Majesty’s Government and your support and the good intention ~nd confidence existing between us.

The Shaikh was strongly of opinion that individuals coming for musatala should not he required to take out permits. His argument was that the Saudi Government would not give permits and therefore this would prevent musahala of this kind. g. My comments are as follows. (a) there are also object ions from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, vide point (c) in VC To reign Offio© letter No#B# 2671/34/24^ of 4th ay 1939 to the India Office. I ! ‘ ^ (b) Brima facie the Saudi Government are certainly in correct in claiming, as they appear to do, all the sections of all the tribes enumerated as being subject to them. Some of the tribes and their habitats ar© mentioned In loriiaer's Gazetteer Volume II. Thift question of suzerainty over tribes is a important one and. if the Shaikh were to give up officially and publicly in a treaty his suzerainty over sections of tribes which have always been recognised as being under Kuwait, his prestige would certainly suffer. I do not think that he will give in on this point. There would seem to be only two solutions, either for the Saudi cavern- ment to drop this clause or for the two parties to come to an agreement over the sections of the tribes subject to them respectively. (o) The present situation, which has lasted about six monthsthocordlng to Information given me by the Shaikh, that Tbn Saud, without any public announce ment to that effect on the subject, has relaxed his /his “blockade somewhat hy allowing his tribesmen to go to Kuwait and other neighbouring States for rausabala. This Ibn Saud has done not with ary idea of helping Kuwait but under pressure from his tribes. The Shaikh naturally wants this situation to continue. 4. The Shaikh told me that if was not Ibn Saud himself who made difficulties but some of his entourage such as Yusuf Yasin and ?uad Hamza, and that if he - the Shaikh - could have a personal Interview with Ibn Saul, he could probably settle matters with him. I think there is a good deal in this. The Shaikh is visiting Ibn Saud shortly vide my telegram No.T/97 of 22nd May 1939^ ^ and I am of the opinion that the Shaikh should be informed that there is no objection to his having a private and informal conversation with Ibn Saud on subjects (b) and (o) above, (a) being reserved for consideration by His Majesty's Government. (The subject of the Agreements will, I imagine, in any case oome up in the course of conversations between the two Rulers). I would be grateful for a telegram as soon as possible authorising this communication. I suggest that Ibn Saul be not informed of this as any commun ication to this effect would have to go through either Yusuf Yasin or Fuad Hamza who, I am afraid, would then do their best to prevent any concessions by Ibn Saud. 3d.

I pointed out that you had already suggested to His Majesty f s Government that he should discuss certain clauses of Kuwait - Saudi Agreement during the visit and that, by not going now, further delay in the conclusion of the Agreements would result, Shaikh said that as postponement was at Ibn Saud^ suggestion there was no help for the delay. Pacts as stated in your paragraph 3 (c) incline me to think that Shaikh welcomes the postponement. 3. I do not think that Shaikh will go on a visit in August when travel conditions will be worse than they are now. Neither/Neither is he likely to go in say October in view of the impending visit to Delhi.

You will see that Powle reports three objections raised by the Sheikh to the Saudi drafts. The first relates to the suggested extradition by the Sheikh of persons not under his jurisdiction. This objection was dealt with as point (i) (not point (c) as stated by Powle) of paragraph 3 of your letter, and will no doubt have to be discussed by Bullard with the Saudi authorities in due course. With regard to the other objections raised by the Sheikh, relating to the proposed lists of tribes subject to Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, and to the requirement that tribesmen going for musabala should carry permits, Powle suggests that the Sheikh should/ teggallay, Esq., ’eign Office , S.W.l.should ho told there is no objection to his having a private and iniormal .conversation on these points with Ibn Saud ? whom he is about to visit at Riyadh. This seems to us an excellent suggestion and we do not think that any objection need be raised against it in principle. Me hope that you will agree and we should be glad to have your views very urgently as the Sheikh may be leaving any day now for Riyadh.

No. 76. ()()() () Your telegram No. 94 of 9th June. I think that direct discussions between the Sheik of Koweit and Ibn Baud can only do good. For instance Yussuf Yassin alleged that some of Ibn Baud’s more extreme demands had already been accepted by Sheik and if tnis was bluff it will be called. Faisal told me on 11th June that Ibn Saud was anxious to know whether agreement [? was] likely to be concluded soon as otherwise he must take further measures against smuggling from Koweit which he alleged had reached enormous proportions.

In the difficult matter of the tribes claimed by the Saudi Government (see 3 (bTlof my Express Letter Ko.C/226, dated the 27th May 1939) what is required is a complete list from the Shaikh of what tribes, and what sections of tribes he claims as belonging to Kuwait# x imagine that he ma^ find it difficult to produce proof of his suzerainty, but then so will the Saudiss they have not produced any up to date. 4 I think,however,it would be useful if the Shaikh could produce such proof as he has. I do not imagine that when it comes to suzerainty over Bedouin tribes, boundaries are any use at all by way of proof.

The remarks in my paragraphs reply to the matter in the correspondingly numbered paragraphs in your letter. 2. The posts I suggest for establishment on the Kuwait side are: by land (a) Subaihiyah (b)Jahra, and by sea (a)Kuwait port. I have no objection to the definition of the 'caravan** as suggested, provided that caravans consist of recognized merchants only and traders only with their following. 4 0 i have no objection to a preamble provided that in substance it is the same as the preambles for the Bon Vo is inage and Extradition Agreements. (iii) I have no objection to the addition of a phrase regarding warning. (iv) I have no objection to the inclusion of smuggling as one of the offences against which action may be taken, though smuggling should automatically 5. With regard to the Bon Yoisinage Treaty: (i) I note the alteration in the preamble and have no objection. (ii) I agree to the alterations in article one cease/-oease on the conclusion of the agreements* (v) I agree to the alterations. (vi) I have no objection to the alteration. (vii) I have no objection to the change made. (viii) I do not agree to the exclusion of the word 'Musabala” from article § and I wish the Saudi Government draft to be modified. Unless it is modified to permit tribesmen and poor Arabs to cross the frontier for the purpose of Musabala either in large or small groups or individually free of all restrictions I think great hardship will be their Icat. I do not desire to be a party to the imposition upon the wandering people strict commercial regulations and the necessity of moving many miles out of their way to obtain papers the meaning of which will be obscure to them. The Bedouins already have free access to my territory and I do not wish to upset that, lhat I want is for traders also to come, though being more conversant with affairs they can obtain documents and thus we shall present smuggling. (ix) I have no objection to this amendment as I have previously permitted tax collectors from Saudi Arabia to enter my territory and collect Zakat. (x) I cannot agree to this article. I wish that it may be omitted or modified to read that both the Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti Governments can employ the subjects of one another Government in their respective armed forces etcetera. (xi) As His Majesty King Abdul Aziz has given his word to the British Minister in ledda that there is no objection to hunting parties crossing the frontier I am quite content that no mention of the matter should be made in the Treaty. (xii) I have no objection. (xiii) I have already given in paragraph (viii) above my desires in the matter of 'Musabala*. Of course pilgrims should/-should he exenrpted from all restrictions* (xiv) I agree to the alteration. (i) I agree to the Redrafting of this article, hut I think the meaning should not he restricted to camels. The word 'animals n should he inserted instead. (ii) I have no objection. (iii) I notice that the Saudi Government have inserted the names of all the tribes inhabiting north Arabia as coming under Saudi dominion now this is not as it should he for the Bashayida people are my people and nearly all members of that tribe live in my territory. This is a well known fact and I collect Zakat from this tribe and my fore-fathers have done so before me, even as they and I have done with regard to at least one third of the Awazim tribe. Of all the tribes mentioned in article seven of the schedule certain members dwell in my territory, and those people are subject to me, and I cannot agree that it be laid down in an agreement that they are not subject to me. (iv) I have no objection. 7. (i) Now my objections to this are that although I am quite prepared to show leniency, as far as I can, towards my neighbour, the Saudi Arabian Government, I find that it may not be easy to carry out the contents of the articles referred to, but it is easy and within my power to take action against any person of my subjects if he contravenes the terms of the Agreement and its articles. It is similarly easy to hand over any person who is a national of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom if he commits an act which is in contravention of the Agreement. But it is very difficult to use this word as a general term, as the offender might be a national of a third State. Here I wish to know what the/-4 the proper definition of this 'third State' is. Is this State known? Is it in Treaty relations with the Saudi Arabian Government or with me or does it mean a mere State only? I wish to do all in my power towards the stoppage of offences 'but I cannot undertake, owing to my Treaty with His Majesty*s Government, to deliver the subjects of a third State to the Saudi Arabian Government, unless of course they be of a neighbouring Moslem State, this I can agree to do after consulting His Majesty's Government. (ii) I have no objection to the terms of the redraft. (iii) I have no objection to this proposal though it is an Arab custom to sign and seal also all documents, (iv) I have no objection to this.

These two places, in the Shaikh *s opinion, are the only places practicable because of the lack of sweet water elsewhere. Paragraph 5 (viii) of the Shaikh’s reply: The Shaikh’s point is that if the traders iiiiport stifficient goods there will be no incentive for the Bedouin to smuggle, arid therefore no need to restrict their movements. The Shaikh is adamant that no restrictions should be placed on the Bedouin, whereas the Saudis will apparently insist (vide para* graph 4 of enclosure 1 to Jedda despatch No. 51 of the 19th No* 0/279 Political Agency, the lo+h TniTr Kuwait. 19 39; Dated 1 e 19 th July, To Reference —‘*r Express Letter No. 571-S of the 16th June, 1939 2 I enclose copies of my letter to the Shaikh and his reply. The Shaikh’s reply contains materially the same views as he expressed to you himself. 4 My brief comments are as follows: (Signature) March/ S. 44. MFP—1048 S&amp;P—(M-2042)—17-12.37—20,000. Designation)2 - (p^&gt;) March, 1939) that they must conform to a regulation, whatever the Shaikh’s motives may he, and I daresay he does not think that the value of trade to he brought hy the merchants will compensate for the loss of Bedouin traffic brought about by restricting their movements, to impose restrictions on the Bedouin would be most difficult in practice. Bin Saud himself has had to lift the blockade unofficially, and for these reasons alone the Shaikh s insistence on the free movement of the Bedouin is, I think, sound. Shaikh’s paragraph 5 (x) is a fresh objection but the Saudis are not insistent on this amendment (vide paragraph (li) of enclosure 2 to Jedda despatch No. 51 of 19th March, 1939). halts' Shaikh’s paragraph 6 (i). This is a reversion to the original wording. Shaikh’s paragraph 6 (iii). I have attempted to get chap ter ana verse for the Shaikh’s statement, but can get nothing comprehensive and conclusive. What does emerge is (a) that the Bashiyada are still 'servants* of the Shaikh and (b) the Awazim were 'servants', but about two thirds gave their allegiance to Bin Saud during the Akhwan movement. The remaining third are the fishermen of Kuwait and inhabitants of the islands, (c) The Ajman and Mutair have likewise mostly gone over to Bin Saul. Shaikh*s paragraph 7 (i) last sentence. The Shaikh’s sti pulation to consult His Majesty’s Government is new. I think we need not take up this point now as it is proposed by the Foreign Office (vide paragraph 3 (i) of Foreign Office letter No. IT.^671/34/25 of the 4th May, 1939) to omit or correct the article.
