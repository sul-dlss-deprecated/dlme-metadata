PART I—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—MUSCAT STATE. During the first portion of the year under review, that is to say, until the end o£ October 1886, Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles was in charge of the Persian Gulf Political Kesidency, and had the honour in July of presenting His Highness the Sultan of Muscat with the insignia of Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. The impressive nature of the ceremony, and its significance, were enhanced by the announcement made on the occasion, to the effect that His Highness Seyyid Toorkee could rely on the support of the British Govern ment against unprovoked aggression during his own lifetime. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler, who held charge of the Muscat Political Agency during the first half of the official year, has furnished the summary of events in Oman which forms the second part of this report. 2.—PIRATE COAST OF OMAN. The following are the independent districts or townships of the so-called Pirate Coast of Oman, with the ruling Chiefs who are parties to the maritime truce (1) Ras-el-Kheimah.—Shaikh Hameyd-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe El-Kowasim or J owasim. (2) Umm-el -Kawain.—Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali. (3) Ajman.—Shaikh Rashid-bin-Hameyd, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali. (4) Shargah.— Shaikh Sakar-bin-Khalid, of the tribe El-Kowasim. (5) Debay.—Shaikh Rashid-bin-Maktum, of the tribe Al-bu-Falasah. (6) Abu -Dhebbi.—Shaikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah, of the tribe Beni-Yas. Durino- the year the several Chiefs observed their engagements to the British Government and no breaeh o£ the maritime truce occnrred, but, as usual, petty disturbances, the result ol tribal jealousies, were not wanting on land. ^ „ . , In the winter o£ the previous year the townships o£ Ras-el-Khcimah, Ras-el-Kawain, and Shargah were leagued against Debay, Ajman, and Himriyah, the latter township being ongina ly and still nominally, a dependency o£ Shargah, but now disavowing allegiance. On the^efeat ot •£*«»sast I^rLtiltr^enDebay, Ajman and Himriyah on the one side, and Ras-el-Kheimah on the other, continued. DeW ^ad incited the Shaikh of Kumzar, the people of In April it was reporte y ^ a Ras -el-Kheimah, and that raids had occurred fnIXe- 6 so arising has continued throughout the year and is still rri'« »- ••«' el-Kawain Chie£.

The Umm-el-Kawain force entered Himriyah, which they pillag-ed and fired, carrying off twenty-five slaves and some cattle and booty. The Chief of Himriyah shut himself up in his fort, and the Umm-el-Kawain force withdrew. A few men and women were killed on this occasion. To avenge this disaster. Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, the Chief of Debay, took the field, in June, with 35 horsemen and 400 camel-riders, and proceeded against Umm-el-Kawain, being joined on the way by contingents from Himriyah and Ajman. When in sight of Umm- el-Kawain and awaiting expected reinforcements, the Chief of Himriyah proposed to destroy certain date-groves belonging to Umm-el-Kawain, but to this the Debay Chief would not consent. The Himriyah Chief then proceeded to make petty raids towards Umm-el-Kawain, and falling in with two men of the Beni-Katab made them prisoners and slew a man of the Alali tribe, who was leaving Umm-el-Kawain. The Chief of Debay disapproving these pro ceedings broke up his camp and returned home. The ex-Chief of Shargah, Shaikh Salim-bin-Sultan, thought the time was favourable for an attempt to regain his position at Shargah, and visited Ajman with this view. His hopes being disappointed he returned to the island of Bu-Musa. In June a feud broke out between Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Ali of the El-Noeym of El- Bereymi and the El-Jowasim, owing to the Noeymi^s dissatisfaction at his treatment when on a visit to the Chief of Shargah. Some raids were made by the El-Noeym towards Shargah, and an attack on that town or on Ras-el-Kheimah was apprehended. In September, Shaikh Sakar-bin-Sultan of Shargah preceeded on a visit to the Chief of Debay to renew the treaty of alliance they had formed, and to endeavour to induce the Debay Chief to join with him in attacking Ajman. The cause of the renewal of hostility between Shargah and Ajman was as follows :— A respectable merchant of Ajman named Khalifah-bin-Masabbah, being displeased with the Chief of Ajman removed to Shargah, whereupon the Ajman Chief seized Khalifah's house and property, and detained his boat and crew prohibiting the latter from joining him at Shargah. The Shargah Chief remonstrated, and requested Ajman either to allow the crew to join Khalifah or to pay the amount of the latter's claim against them. This request not being complied with, divers began to desert from Shargah to Ajman and vice versa. Shargah having consulted Umm-el-Kawain as to the propriety of attack ing Ajman, the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain tried to effect a reconciliation, advising Ajman to settle Khalifah-bin-Masabbah's just claims, but the Ajman Chief declined, and sought the alliance of Umm-el-Kawain, but without success. Eventually, by the intervention of the Residency Agent, the crew of Khalifah-bin-Masabbah's boat were restored to him. On the 22nd November 1886, Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, Chief of Debay, died. The choice of his successor lay between the late Chief's son Maktum and his brother Rashid. Eash had supporters of nearly equal numbers, but eventually the elders of the tribe prevailed on the people to decide the matter peaceably, and Shaikh Rashid-bin-Maktum was elected Chief. The election being open to no objection was recognised by the Resident. The pearl fishery on the Oman Coast having been unsatisfactory, and the last take of mother-o'-pearl in the Red Sea having been considerable, some 200 boats have gone from Oman to the Red Sea for this season's fishing with more numerous crews than usual. , 3.—BAHRAIN. These islands have enjoyed peace and prosperity during the past year, and there is no thing of interest to add to their history. The Chief, Shaikh Eesa-bin-Ali, continues to maintain intimate friendly relations with the Na eem tribe of the mainland, to whom, and to other Arabs of the mainland, he makes yearly presents of considerable value. Indeed a large portion of the revenues of Bahrain are dissipated in this manner without any ostensible compensating advantage. In the early part of the year the Moteserrif of El-Hasa wrote to Shaikh Eesa accusing him of having caused the secession of certain Arab tribes from the Governor of El-Bidda, and also of having aided the Clnef of Abu-Dhebbi in his movements against El-Katr. Shaikh Kesa foiwaided this letter to the Acting Resident, who advised him to reply in courteous terms that the reports which had reached the Turkish Governor were unfounded. In the summer, robberies were committed on Bahrain boats in the Turkish port of El- Katif, and remonstrances were duly made. These annoyances have ceased of late. In August Abdullah-bin-Su'ood-bin-Eeysal visited Bahrain, probably in hopes of receiv- ng presents from the Chief.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-8?. EJrHasa. About the same time a messenger arrived in Bahrain from Path Ah* Kh p S „ .1 L,, b..™ B ,, Shaikh K,.. h.h ,h, uhihles o-h«, .h.,, The Subhme Porte having made representations to the British Government, intereedino- for the release of Shaikh Mnhammad-bin-Khalifah from Aden, in view to hi retiring to spend the —dor of h.s days m the holy places of Arabia, the Government of India decided to release the Shaikh on the 16th February, on the occasion of the celebration of Her Majesty s Jubilee, and this was accordingly done. It does not appear that Muhammad- hin-Khalifah personally cared whether he resided at Aden or at Mecca, his only wish bein'- to return to Bahrain—a wish which could not well be acceded to. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR, The Province o£ Tsejd appears to have been singularly tranquil during the past year, Nejd. ail&lt; ^ 110 news of any interest has been received thence. An uneventful year in El-Hasa. Nazeeh Pasha, the Muteserrifj was relieved in March by Saleh Pasha. Interest in the events of this district chiefly centres about El-Bida'a and its vicinity, El-Katr. an ^ between Shaikh Jasim-bin- Muhammad Thani and his Bedouin followers on the one side, and his CjuonddM adviser, -Vluhainmad-bin-Abdul Wahab, and certain seceding coast Arabs on the other. Dissensions have, during the past few years, been rife amongst the Arabs residing under the jurisdiction of Shaikh Jasim of El-Bida^a, and bodies of seceders first settled at El-Foweyrat on the Katr Coast, where they are to some extent under the protection of the Noeym tribe who maintain intimate friendly relations with the Chief of Bahrain. In the year 1885 a body of the Wakrah Arabs consisting of about 100 men of the tribes Al-bu-Ainain and Al-Jehran, owing to disputes with their own Chief and with * Ghareyah or Ghareyat. Shaikh Jasim, left Wakrah and settled at a place named El-Ghareyah * in Katr^ A coalition has thus been formed to resist Shaikh Jasim, and during the past year Muhammad-bin- Abdul Wahab, having quarrelled with Jasim, identified himself with the opposing faction. A conference took place between Jasim and Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab in presence of the commander of a Turkish gun-boat at El-bida'a, when the Turkish officer suggested that Jasim should let the people of Ghareyah remain in peace under Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab. Shaikh Jasim was much annoyed at the proposal and incited his adherents to attack El-Ghareyah, but they were beaten off with the loss of a few men of the Beni-Hajir. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab entered on a course of intrigue with the Turkish officials of El-Hasa, apparently with the object of ousting Shaikh Jasim and obtaining for himself the post of Kaim Makam of El-Katr under the Turkish Government. He is said to have advised the institution of a Turkish custom house at El-Bidk, a measure which seems to have been favourably considered by the Turkish officials whilst the inhabitants warmly protested against it. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had transferred his residence from El-Bida'a to Ghareyah, proceeded on a visit to El-Hasa, whence he returned in May,Ojair, accompanied by a tody of about 50 Turkish gendarmes, of whom 20 were said to be for the protection of Ghareyah and the rest for the relief of the garrison of El-Bida. It was reported that the Muteserrif of El-Hasa had proclaimed Ghareyah to be Turkish territory. Subsequently the commander of the Turkish gun-boat Zohaff landed at Ghareyah, and made notes of the leading inhabitants, &amp;c. Shaikh Jasim greatly resented the position assumed by Muhammad-bm-Abdul Wahab, with the aid and support of the Turks, of Governor of Ghareyah, and threatened to withdraw from El-Bida'a with his adherents and to commence hostilities against Muhammad-bm-Abdul Wahab. In July it was reported that Muhammad -bin-Abdul Wahab has visited Shaikh Jasim at El-Bida'a, and that terms of reconciliation were arranged between them with the cognisance of the Turkish commander. The Turkish corvette Zohaff fired a salute of 21 guns in honour of the occasion, but the terms agreed on were kept secret. v- 1 IW:! I fm' !■ I 1 'r'ii ■ iiii Bil'i llli8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL In August two Hindu traders were attacked and slightly wounded by Bedouins during the absence of Shaikh Jasim. Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahim Hakim proceeded to the spot in H. M. S. Kingfisher and investigated the matter. There was strong suspicion of collu sion on the part of Shaikh Jasim; but as it was not proved that he was concerned, and as he disavowed having had any hand in the outrage in a very solemn manner, it was not consider ed necessary or advisable to take severe steps against him. During the autumn several cases of petty piracy occurred on the coast of Ei-Katr. Small parties of Beni-Hajir Bedouins seizing small boats lying on the shore put out in them and robbed passing vessels. In view to checking these disorders H. M. S. Sphinx proceeded to the Katr coast carrying the Residency Confidential Agent, Aga Muhammad Rahim, who had interviews with various headmen, delivered the Residents letters to them, and obtained verbally and in writing assurances of their co-operation in endeavouring to put down these irregularities. Several robberies took place on boats of Bahrain in the waters of El-Kateef, the Turkish officials showing their usual apathy and indifference. Reports of these incidents were for warded, as usual, to the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had continued to keep up an active correspondence with the Turkish officials of El-Hasa and Turkish Arabia, visited Bahrain in winter. He was there met by the El-Jehrain from El-Gherayah,about 250 in number, and it was arranged that these people should settle at Darain inthe Kateef District, where Muhammad-bin- Abdul Wahab would join them later and become their leader. He obtained permission of the Governor of El-Hasa for this settlement. Probably, indeed, it had been preconcerted for some time. By this migration El-Ghareyah has become nearly depopulated, whilst Darain appears on the fair way to becoming a village of some importance. 5.—EARS. The administration of the province of Ears has undergone no change since the last report was written. In former years the whole province, extending from Bushire to the Mekran coast, along the sea coast, was under a Governor-General whose seat of Government was the central town of Shiraz. At present the Government of Shiraz is subordinate to His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, who resides at Ispahan, and the sea-ports of Lingah, Bunder Abass and dependencies are severed from the Government of Shiraz and are under theAmeen- es-Sultan, Minister for Customs, &amp;c., who administers these districts from the capital. At Shiraz the titular Governor is His Royal Highness the Jelal-ed-dowlah, now entered on adolescence, but His Excellency the Sahib Diwan continues to be the virtual administrator of that portion of Ears which is still under the Government of Shiraz, and his rule during the period under review was singu larly unfortunate. Although the rainfall of 1885-86 was abundant, the crops were again attacked by 'rust' and the harvest was consequently scanty. Great distress prevailed in Shiraz culminating in a severe bread riot in July. On this occasion the Persian Telegraph Office was entered by the mob and wrecked, and the persons of the Telegraph officers were for a time in considerable danger. Throughout the districts of Shiraz much disorder prevailed and robberies and outrages were very frequent. The Kashkai and other Eels were completely out of hand, and plundered without fear and with impunity. This state of things was intensified by quarrels between the Eel-Khani, Sultan Muhammad Khan, and the Eel-Begi, Darab Khan, neither of whom col lected or paid the State revenues. Private dissensions also existed between the Sahib Diwan and his nephew, the Kawwam- ul-Mulk, which, doubtless, contributed much to keep up disorder in the town and districts. The strife between the relatives has recently led to the downfall of the Kawwam-ul-Mulk, who was taken to Ispahan and put in chains. The Eel-Begi, Darab Khan, has also encountered similar fate, and the affairs of the Kashkai Eels have been entrusted to the Eel-Khani. The Foreign Office Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Muhammad Khan, Motemin-el-Wazarah, having been transferred to the same post at Bushire, was succeeded by Haji Mirza Aga Khan, nephew of the Sahib Diwan, Her Majesty's Jubilee was celebrated at Shiraz on 16th February. Haji Muhammad Mehdi, the Malek-et-Tujar, who was Governor of Bushire at the Bushire and Districts. opening of the year, resigned in May and was replaced in the Government by Haji Fath Ali Khan. Subsequently HisRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITIC A.L AGENCY FOR 1886-87, 9 Excellency Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk was appointed Governor of Bushire and its districts, whilst Mirza Husam Khan, Motemm-ul-Mulk, was made Governor of Behbahan. Serious disturbances took place at Borazjan in April. A French vessel of war, the to/, visited Bushire in April and proceeded to Mohamme- rah, where t ley embarked M. and Madame Dieulafoy, who had been excavating the ruins at Susa and carried to trance a large 'Trouvaille.'' The U. S. frigate BrooUyn visited Bushire in November, and the Captain and several officers 'visited Shiraz, where they weie hospitably received and entertained. Chevalier R. C. Keun de Hoogerwoerd, Consular Representative of the Netherlands in Persia, returned to Bushire from leave in February. Shaikh Kadtheeb has remained in charge of Lingah as Deputy Governor, contracting to Lingah&lt; ^ ai ' m ^ ie revenues. Lingah (as well as Bunder Abbass) is under the Ameen-es-Sultan. The Arab population of Lingah are in favour of Shaikh Kadtheeb, preferring an Arab to a Persian Governor, but the Shaikh's tenure of office is precarious. The Government of Bunder Abbass is administered locally by persons of no rank or stand- Bunder Abbass ^ ese P ersons are selected by the Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire under the orders of the Ameen-es-Sultan. The system is eminently unsatisfactory as regards British commercial interests, as responsibility is shifted at convenience from one official to another. The Shaikh of Kishm, by name Ibrahim, was arrested by the Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire and sent in chains to Teheran subsequently. His cousin Shaikh Hasan was appointed Shaikh of Kishm. Shaikh Ibrahim was accused of allowing the Shias of Kishm to be assaulted by Sunnis during the Moharram, and had paid a fine of 2,000 kerans on that account. As a matter of fact, he appears to have taken measures to protect the Shias on the occasion. Colonel Ben. Williams, Director of Remounts for India, assisted by Veterinary Surgeon Rayment, was engaged in purchasing horses for Government in South Persia during the summer and autumn, and succeeded in collecting several hundred serviceable animals. This was the first experiment in the way of purchasing direct in Persia. 6.—ARABISTAN. This province has been undisturbed during the past year. Shaikh Miza'al Khan retained the government of Mohammerah and its districts undisturbed. Lieutenant-Colonel and Madame Dieulafoy made very successful excavations at Susa, and carried ofi to France a large and valuable collection of antiquities. 7.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. In May 1886 a raid was made from Kalat territory on the small village of Firozabad near Sirbaz on the Persian side of the frontier. One Yar Muhammad Rind, a cousin of Mir Mowladad, Chief of Sirbaz, and himself a Persian subject, had retired from the Persian side to Mand, where he collected about 150 men, whom he led against Firozabad, and in the fight which took place a few men fell on both sides. Yar Muhammad subsequently fled to Karachi, where he was arrested, and Colonel Reynolds was directed by the Government of India to investigate the case. At Gwadur, Colonel Reynolds was met by General Zeyn-el-Abidin, Persian Governor of Baluchistan, Mir Mowladad, and others and the matter was gone into. The Persian Government pressed for the surrender of Yar Muhammad to their officers, but this demand was not complied with. The Baho district under Muhammad Ali is reported in a lamentable state owing to excessive taxation, the result of Persian pressure. The sea coast Tillage of Gwetter has been deserted by the inhabitants who have mostly settled at Jewm in Kalat territory. Many o the Baho people have emigrated to Karachi— solitndinem f admit. A native of India was murdered in Baho, and the suspected man was arrested by the Persian Governor and brought to Gwadur, where Mr. Flinch mvest,gated the charge and evidence. There seemed no reason to doubt the man's guilt, and General Zeyn-el-Abidm promised to dispose of the case according to Shara law, but on return to Baho ^ released. Mr. Flinch was of opinion that this was done because of the refusal to hand ovei Yar Muhammad Rind to the Persians. t , • , i j A fort has been built at Pishkan, the western boundary of the Gwadur district, by order of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Mir Hoti, Chief of Gaih, the most extensive coast district of Mekran, died at Bampur on the 2nd of February 1887. It is not known who the successor will be. The last seasons rainfall in Mekran was fairly good. In December the Persian Government sent an Agent to Cape Jask with orders to estab lish a Government House and Custom House there, and to furnish minute reports of the proceedings of the English officials at that place. It appears that alarming reports had reached His Majesty the Shah of the doings and designs of the British in that quarter, which had greatly disturbed the Royal mind. The facts were as follows:—In accordance with a convention between the British and Persian Govern ments, dated 1868, the Government Indo-European land line of telegraph was extended from Gwadur to Cape Jask and the latter place became the terminus of land line and sub-marine cable. The rocky and then uninhabited promontory of Jask was, with the assent of the Persian Government and authorities, fixed on for the erection of the necessarily somewhat large telegraph station. At that period, as now, Jask was under the Government of Bunder Abbass, but the Persian authorities took little active interest in the Baluch districts and the petty Chiefs were left much to themselves. In pursuance of the system which had been observed in view of securing thft telegraph line from wilful injury at the hands of the Baluch inhabitants along the coast of Mekran, the headmen of the districts near Jask, namely, Mir Abdul Nubbi and Mir Ali, were assigned subsidies of R40 and 30, respectively, in consideration of their promising to protect the wires, &amp;c., from injury in their districts. In course of years, and in absence of interference of the Persian authorities, a village grew up in the vicinity of the telegraph buildings, and in the year 1879 a company of sepoys of the Bombay Marine Battalion being compelled to leave Bassidore on account of its unhealthiness, was placed at Jask, and quarters erected for their accommodation. Subsequently, on a detach ment being removed from Gwadur, it was transferred to Jask, bringing up the strength of the Jask detachment to about one hundred. ■ The Persian Agent, who was sent to Jask last December, hot only corroborated all the sinister reports which had reached the Shah ; s ears, but drawing on a naturally fertile imagin ation, considerably improved on them. He represented the Baluch tribes as having thrown off their allegiance, the English as exercising sovereign rights, and eventually reported having recovered seventeen townships for the Persian Government, for which imaginary exploits he was rewarded. The Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire was next deputed by the Persian Minister to Jask in the Persian Government ship Persepolis, it being thought that an official of his standing would furnish more faithful reports. This, however, was a mistake, as the Malek-et-Tujar on the whole contirmed the reports of his subordinate, and, in order to make a tangible impression, seized Mir Abdul Nubbi and Mir Ali, the two principal Shaikhs of Jask, and carried them in chains to Bushire. The former of these Chiefs, Mir Abdul Nubbi, was actually the Local Governor of the Biaban district, a man of character and energy, who had been usually troublesome to the British officials of Jask. The other, Mir Ali, is an old man of eighty years, quiet, inoffensive, and of the best Baluch family of the district. Neither of these persons had been guilty of any disloyalty to Persia, or committed any offence to deserve the treatment they received, but they were receiving British pay, and it suited the agitators to represent them as traitors and malefactors. These, with other prisoners, were subsequently sent heavily chained from Bushire to Teheran, any intercession of British authority in their behalf being considered only likely to corroborate the suspicions entertained. The general question of the position of the British at Jask having been discussed bv Her Majesty ; s Charge d''Affaires at Teheran, a satisfactory arrangement was come to by which the Telegraph Department are assigned liberal limits. There was of course never any question of denying the right of the Persian Government to establish a Government and Custom House at Jask, nor of maintaining a military guard there against their wish. It was arranged accordingly that the Persian Government Agent should establish himself outside the telegraph limits, and that the military guard should be withdrawn. Mirza Nasrullah, the First Agent, was recalled, and Mirza Hedayet appointed in his stead. 8.—SLAVE TRADE. Four of Her Majesty's ships, viz., Reindeer, Wovdlark, Kingfisher, and Sphinx were en- gaged from 25th April 1886 until 18th June in the spring operations against slavers from the African coast.

Th.s was probably the truth, and it is more than probable that in man y instances the cargoes consisted chiefly of slaves. There can be no doubt that a large number of slaves were shipped from the coast of Africa during the year, and, by means not fully ascertained, a considerable number reached the Batinah coast and other parts of Oman. Her Majesty's ships Woodlarh and Kingfisher cruised from July to 28th October, when operations ceased. An extensive a khor ' or creek was discovered by Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher near the village of Sowaih-Beni-bu-Ali. 9.—OFFICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENT. Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles held charge of the Residency during the first half of the official year, and was relieved by Colonel E. C. Ross on 30th October. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler acted as First Assistant Resident from 1st November to 16th January, when Mr. P. J. C. Robertson relieved him. Her Majesty's ships served on the station as follows :— Her Majesty's ship Reindeer joined the station 30th August 1885 and left 2nd June 1886. Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher joined 26th April 1886, proceeded to Bombay 7th July, and returned to Persian Gulf station 10th August. Her Majesty's ship Sphinx joined the station 8th May, proceeded to give leave 1st August and returned 6th September. Proceeded to Bombay to recommission on 5th March 1887, and has since returned to the station. Her Majesty's ship Woodlark joined 2nd June and left 11th December. Her Majesty's ship Osprey joined 25th January. Captain Rainier, Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher, was senior naval officer until he left in April on promotion, and the duties of senior officer devolved on Captain Gissing of Her Majesty's ship Osprey. Rear Admiral Sir F. Richards, K.C.B., visited Muscat and the Persian Gulf in April, and was received with due courtesy and attention by the Muscat and Persian authorities. 10.—OBSERVATORY—CLIMATE. The usual observations have been recorded, and the results are shown in the annexed tables. The rainfall of 1886-87 has been very scant, but the harvest will probably be equal to that of the previous year, which was at the last much damaged by rust. The 'Barih' shemal blew from May to 10th July, after which extreme heat was expe rienced for about one month. The winter was very fine and few heavy gales blew, but the autumn and early winter season was sickly in Bushire, and rate of mortality unusually high. CELEBRATION OF HER MAJESTY'S JUBILEE YEAR. In accordance with orders received from the Government of India, Her Majesty's Jubilee was celebrated in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat on 16th February by illummations and ceremonial observances. The enthusiasm displayed by all classes on the occasion ^ gmti y- ing, and in many cases.

At the commencement of the official year, affairs in the Sharkiyeh were in a somewhat ^disturbed state and in other parts of the country there were various small matters requiring adjustment. In April—Muhammad and Marash, sons of Nasir-bin-Sei£, former Shaikh of the Beni Riam, weie put to death by their uncle Suleiman-bin-Seif at Nezwa, he fearing that they would wrest from him the Shaikhdom; the other two sons made their escape. In May—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee received the present of a steamer, the S. S. Sultanee from his brother, the Sultan of Zanzibar. Muhammad-bin-Shinas Shaikh of the Beni Battash, was seized on his entering Muscat and put to death by order of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee; he is said to have been a turbulent character, and his tribe had for some time past been giving trouble. Muhammad-bin-Adi was the nominated Shaikh by the Sultan. In June—The Al-bu-Saeedees living at Heil Ghaf came into Muscat, fearing reprisals by the Beni Battash on account of the death of Muhammad-bin-Shinas. In July—On the I3th instant His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was presented at a Darbar held in his palace with the Insignia of a G.C.S.I., conferred on His Highness by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen-Empress by Colonel Miles, Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf; and on the same occasion a promise of active support from the British Government to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee during his lifetime against unprovoked aggression was announced to His Highness. Most of the principal Chiefs of Oman were present at the Darbar, but his brother, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, to whom an invitation had been sent, after accepting it and coming to within a few miles of Muscat, demanded a guarantee of safety from the British Political Agent in addition to that already given him by the Sultan, which was refused and he returned to Semed without attending the Darbar ; his people killed three Siabiyeen on their way back, and the Siyabiyeen a few days after killed three Shibul in retaliation. On the 28th instant His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, accompanied by his son Seyyid Muhammad, started for a trip into the interior and was absent for a week. His Highness had not visited the interior for many years. In August—A dispute arose between the Awamir and Beni Jabir which resulted in loss of life, and appeared likely to lead to much trouble. Shaikh A.bdullah-bin-Salim, formerly Temee- meh of the Beni-bu-Ali, came to Muscat with a large following on a visit to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. In September—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, accompanied by his sons, Seyyids Faysal and Fahd, visited Kuriyat and Soor in the S. S. Sultanee and was absent a week. At Soor His Highness deputed Suleiman-bin-Sweilim to effect a truce between the Hijveen and the Beni-bu-Ali and Hishm, in which he was successful. It was reported that the Hinaweens had determined to rise, with the object of establishing the Sultan s brother, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, at Soor, or making war on the Ghafree tribes of Jaalan; it was also reported that Seyyid Abdul Aziz had gone with a party of the Haboos to the Beni Battash country. The Beni Battash attacked the fort of Kuryat, but were repulsed with loss; they looted the store-rooms of a Bania of about $£50 worth of goods. Reinforcements were sent to Kuryat under command o£ Seyyid Bede-bin-Seif. Shaikh Rashid-bin-Ali Mnrrab Aamaree, formerly Wali at Gwadur, was killed at Seeb by a man of the Zakawanee tribe named Seif-bm-Hamad whom he also killed. At the end of the month letters were received from Sahm-bm-Hassan at Rahabee, stating that Saleh-bin-Ali had sent a messenger to him demanding passage through the Kahaza pass for the Hinawees who had determined to attack Muscat. In October— The truce which His Highness Seyyid Toorkee had proposed to the Shar- kiveh tribes w.s in danger of being rendered impossible at the outset through an attack by some of the Bem-bu-Ali on a village of the Hijreeen in which two slaves of the H.jreeen Aamaree were killed; the difficulty was, however, got over. The Bern Battash having become di vided in their Councils, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, who had gone to their assistance with some of the Haboos, left their conntry. and on the 13th instant letters were received by the20 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Wazir, Seyyid Saeed-bin-Muhammad, and otKers from Seyyid Abdul Aziz^ who was then at Hajar, demanding an interview with them under threat of destroying their date-groves at that place. The S. S. Sultanee was at once despatched to Kuryat to bring the forces collected there to Muscat, which having arrived on the following day, and being augmented to a total to 700 men from Muscat and Muttrah they started at once for Ha jar; at Karahee they were opposed by a small advanced party of Seyyid Abdul Aziz^s followers whom they routed, but not following up their success sufficiently quickly, Seyyid Abdul Aziz made good his escape to Semed, and the force returned the following day; this operation, though not as successful as it might have been, was of value to the Sultan's prestige. Three days later a force of some 1,2.00 men, which was subsequently augmented with 25 horses and one gun, were sent by sea to Kuryat under command of Seyyid Bede-bin-Seif and the Sultan's sons to coerce the Beni Battash. On the 23rd instant news was received that the force had been opposed by the Beni Battash at Mizfah who had been routed with a loss of seven men. The force subsequently destroyed the town of Mizfah and razed Mazara, the principal fort of the Beni Battash, who tendered their submission and offered to pay a fine of $10,000. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee sent a present of six horses to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress. In November—The force sent against the Beni Battash returned bringing with them the Shaikh Adi-bin-Nasir and six others, who were immediately on arrival imprisoned until the fine should be paid ; they were subsequently released on payment of $4,000. A threatened collision between the tribes of the Batineh and Dhahireh averted by the mediation of the Howasineh and Abbu-Rashid. In December—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee sent seventeen horses, a number of camels and other presents to his brother, the Sultan of Zanzibar. Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Suleiman walad Fana Al-bu-Saeedee deputed to Dhofar as Wali with him Seyyid Abdul Jalil-al-Zawawee and seventy men. A disturbance occurred in the Jaalan between the Jenebeh and other tribes in which three men were killed. In January 1887—Two serious raids by the Awamir, Beni Kattab and other tribes of the Dhahireh in the vicinity of Shinas and Sobar, in which they committed much depredations and Caused some loss to British subjects, which was however subsequently made good by His Hio-h- ness Seyyid Toorkee, Seyyid Hamad-bin-Hamad Wad Samar, appointed Wali of Sohar in pkce of Seyyid Hamad-bin-Nasir recalled. Death of Seif-bin-Hamad Temimeh of the Jenebeh re- ported to have occurred at Aden, and his son Nasir elected in his place. One of the murderers of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Had was killed by relations of the Shaikh. Three of the Beni Hina killed at Khoth by Siabiyeen. t In February—Two men killed at Beeren, and a slave carried off by Beni Sheheyn. Death of Muhammad-bin-Ali, Shaikh of the Naeen, reported. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee held a grand Darbar in honour of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress, at which a letter from His Excellency the Viceroy of India to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was read by the Political Agent. A salute of 101 guns was fired from the forts, and at night the town was illuminated and fireworks let off. S. S. Sultanee sent to Sohar with gunpowder and money, a raid by the Bedouins being reported by the Wali as impending. Yaarab-bin-Kahtan, Wali of Shinas died, and was succeeded by his son. Kahtan-bin-Yaarab Seyyid Suleiman-bin-Hamad appointed Wali of Khabooreh. Letters received from new Wali of Dhofar that he had taken charge of the district. &amp; In March—Shaikh Musalim-bin-Bedwi, former Wali of Sohar, imprisoned on arrival at Muscat for having refused to deliver up the forts for three days. Party of the Beni Kattab on their way to raid in vicinity of Sohar dispersed by the new Wali. A Persian Seyyid ran amuck/' at Muttrah, and was shot by the Wahabi soldiers after he had killed two Baluch; a Wahabi soldier had wounded the Wali's son. Beni-bu-Ali tribe in Jaalan reported to have quarrelled amongst themselves. Shaikhs of the Beni-bu-Hassan from Jaalan came to Muscat on a visit to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. Rear Admiral Sir F. Richards, Commander-in-Chief, Indian Station, visited Muscat in April in H. M.'s S. Sphinx on his way up to the Persian Gulf, and called in again in May when're turning. His Excellency also visited Muscat in H. M/s S. Bacchante in Novemhev on his way from Aden to Bombay. In April 1886—Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, on being appointed Acting Resident in the Per- official changes. sian vice Colon el Ross, C.S.I., appointed Acting Resi dent at Hyderabad, Deccan, made over charge of the Politi cal Agency and Consulate at Muscat to Lieutenant-Colonel Mockler, and resumed charge in November of the same year. &amp;RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1886.87. 21 Europe in Mr. Louis Maguire o£ Messrs.

In the report for year 1885 it was stated that owing to partial failure of the grain crops, and consequent scarcity, trade generally had been much injured and depressed in South Persia, and its recovery or otherwise would depend greatly on the harvest of 1886, the prospects * ' e 'n March 1886 were &gt; w he n the report was written,* favourable. Notwithstanding a good average rainfall of 15^ inches, there was again a partial failure of the crops, especially in the Shiraz districts, and the result of this has been a further depression of trade which was increased by the unfavourable rates of exchange. The year under review has accordingly been most unfavourable, and in no previous year has so unsettled a feeling and so much want of confidence prevailed. The consuming classes have been impoverished from high prices of food, and are unable to purchase other articles of import to the customary extent. Many of the smaller Persian merchants have failed. And all who have continued to transact business have had to do so without reckoning on profits, and what with depressed markets and decreased confidence, no headway has been made. The prospects for 1887 are still uncertain; the rain came late and has been partial only, but reports from Shiraz districts are not unfavourable. Exports, During the early part of 1885 shipments of wheat were permitted and made, but the quantity was limited to a few hundred tons. The quality was very good; the prices of grain were during this period so low as to allow a profit even on the low prices ruling in Europe. After the hot weather prices rose, and in September embargo was placed on exportation of grain which continues in force. The opium crop was about equal to that of the previous year, but the China and London 0 . um markets were very bad, and there was no demand until Sep tember. The tobacco crop was smaller than usual, owing to its being injured by frost in winter^ and prices were correspondingly high. Tobacco is an im portant export of Persia, and the trade has attracted attention f iVo^e.— It is understood this project of late. The Persian Government have decided to institute a is abandoned. regief for Persian tobacco under the control of the Amin-es- Sultan, now head of the whole of the customs of Persia. It is thought that this measure will unfavourably affect the trade. Imports. The decline of the import trade in cotton goods would have been still greater than it Manchester goods. actually was, had it been governed by the law of profits. A decrease chiefly occurred in printed goods. It was in point of fact impossible to import from Europe at a profit, and importers lost heavily, many native speculators of small means having failed. There was a steady decline of other leading articles, such as metals and sugar. The com. . , , petition between French and German sugar continues, and it iviotciis ana ^ is generally expected that the former will gain the market. Large imports of Marseilles loaf sugar were made, but markets owing to the impoverishment of the people are overstocked and holders of stocks apprehended loss. Shipping. The French line of steamers resumed running, but the number is reduced to two, and these are under the management of an English firm. Freights from England to the Persian Gulf and Busrah remained unaltered. But in Freights. consequence of keen competition homeward freights fell to 16«. per ton to England and H6 to Jeddah. Towards the end of the year freights recovered somewhat, and are expected to keep firm for the present.24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL APPENDIX A TO PART III CONSISTING OF THE FOLLOWING TABULAR STATEMENTS. 1.
