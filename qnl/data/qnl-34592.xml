As is often the case with early printed books, the publication itself has received more attention than the contents of the work. Jawa’ib Press was established in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1860 and operated for about 20 years publishing the newspaper al-Jawa’ib (begun in 1861) as well as more than 70 Arabic classics and tracts. Books were printed in runs of several thousand and distributed throughout the Empire. Like the progenitor of Ottoman printing, the ethnically Hungarian Ibrahim Müteferrika (circa 1670–1745), al-Shidiyāq came from outside the tightly structured expectations of the majority culture. Al-Jawa’ib Press belongs as much to Ottoman as to Arab cultural history. Largely neglected in academic research, al-Shidiyāq has recently received increased biographic, bibliographic, and literary attention. The three works in this volume are typical of collections of proverbs and “wisdom literature,” a genre that continues to occupy the popular and scholarly imagination. They are careful but not critical editions of manuscript originals, no doubt transcripts of works al-Shidyāq found in libraries in Istanbul or transcribed on his travels. Typical of works from this press, the volume is printed in a pleasing, readable format. There is an informative colophon giving production details. The three works contained in the volume are Amthal al-‘Arab (Arab proverbs) by Mufaḍḍal al-Dabbī, Asrar al-Hukama’ (Secrets of the wise) attributed to the famous calligrapher Yāqūt al-Mustaʻṣimī, and a collection of sayings and anecdotes from “the ancient philosophers,” notably Plato.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Book</genre><subject><topic>Proverb</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arabic literature</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Istanbul</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Plato</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabic Proverb</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ancient Philosophy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12917#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
