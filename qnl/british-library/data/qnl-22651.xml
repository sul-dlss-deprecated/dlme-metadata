During the course of the Hospital treatment her condition has not improved satisfactorily and the temperature has persisted since well over a month. I saw Dr.Barney this morning. She is of the opinion that it will be in the interest of the patient tkat if she is taken for treatment to India. A certificate to this effect is enclosed herewith. Since the down fast mail is due here on 19th instant I would request that I be kindly granted one week's earned leave to enable me to accompany her to India.

Nasirul Haq,forwarded under cover of your memorandum No. 521-64/224, dated the 19th April 1940,have been received, for Political Agent, Bahrain^- I 'beg to submit that there ©re some different opinions in the application of the Supplementary Rules 116 and 144 throughout the ^ulf. I took up this matter with the Treasury Officer, Bushire in February last and 1 beg to attach herewith a copy of my note to that Officer regarding my travelling allowance. There are only two catagories in which a Government servant is posted to a station other than that to which he was serving begore the event takes place i.e. (a) On direct transfer from one station to another (b) The change of n eadquarter after the expiry of leave The Supplementary Rule 2(l8) states that transfer means (a) the movement of a Government servant from one hestd quarter station in which he is employed to another such station either To take up the duties of a new post In consequence of a change of a Headquarter. Supplementary Rule 144 only deals with the claims of of the Travelling allowance for the journeys when proceeding from on or returning leave (to that station^ only L Clause (a) of Supplementary Rule 144 reads that a Government servant on joining time under Fundamential Rule 105(d) may draw T.A. for the journey on transfer,with the exception that in the case of journey by steamer,instead of 3 fares for self only two fares will be admissible. This is quite correct in the case of those Government servants who proceed on leave from one station and are re-posted to the same station after the expiry of leave. And since there is no correction in Supplementary Rule 116 ,1 think my interpretation of Rule 144 is correct,, because Government servants posted in remote localities on are always hm umtKr Joining time under Fundamental Rule 105(d) in each direction, whether it may be transfer or may be a journey on leave. The Governor G en eral in Council have specified certain stations under F.R» 105(d) and theyr^l ! ' : i/l MfecaW M V M* are mentioned in Supplementary Rule 294-A, f I proceeded on leave from Muscat in July last and during the currency of my leave I was ordered to report my self for dutj^ at Bushire . I am undoubtedly on transfer as explained above. I requested the Treasury Officer, Bushire that my T,A» Claim may be drawn accordinglyjunder Supplementary Rule 116. I was paid two fares only and for one fare the Treasury Officer said that the matter will be referred to A.G.C.R. New Delhi for decision. I will be grateful if Bushire rosy be asked that what^happened to my claim, so that it mey be preferred within 6 months as per instructions contained in Art. 8 of the Civil Account Code Vol. I. A*-' I may add^if my above interpretations is accepted it is benificial to all Government servants serving in the Gulf. i ^7(7 HiKty 1) I proceeded on leave from Muscat in July 1939 and during the currency of ay leave I received orders to the effect that after the expiry of »y leave I should report wy- self for duty at Hushire to take up the duties of a nev: post. I an therefore on transfer vide ^uppleaentary Hule 2(18). My Y.A.claiM for the journey between Karachi and Hushire is therefore goverened under Suppleraentary Kule 116 and the sub-clauses thereto Beet ion XI. 2) Supplementary Hule 144 only deals isith the claims of I 1 .A. for the journeys when proceeding on or returning from leave — Beet ion XIV refers* Clause (aj of Supplementary Hule 144 reads that a Government servant on joining time under jfandamental mile 105(d) may draw T.A- for the journey on transfer # with the exception that in +he case of jemmey by stearner,instead of 3 'ares for self only 2 fares T.ill be admissible e.g. had I returned to my post at Muscat after the expiry of my leave I was entitled to 2 fares only. 5?he joining time between Karachi and Muscat in that case would ave also been goverened under Fundamental Kule lOSidj and the application of Buppleaentary Kule 144 was quite correct. Sut since on the expiry of my leave ray head quarter has been changed and I aa posted to take up the duties of a new post at Jlushire I am undoubtedly on transfer vide para 1 above. 3) when I was in Muscat I fully remember that the T. A. claims of Messrs M.H.Khan.F.B. Prince and Fharma were preferred under Supple mentary Hule 116 # and 3 steamer fares were drav.n for(2). yj for the® although they were returning from leare and *ere alno in Joining time under -''undaraental Hule ;:05(d) between Karachi--^ Muscat, and the Accountant u eneral # Central torn Heyenues, Mew Delhi never objected to the above T,A. claims.

Sir, a .' u , ' ^^spcG'tfUlly request that you will kindly recommend me through the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, for a transfer to India. 2. I liave been working here in the Persian Gulf for over nine years now and regret to say that most of this time I have been m a very indifferent health. y wife too fin s the Gulf climate unsuitable to her and had on two occasions to be hurried hone on grounds of health, necessitating my taking leav to accompany her. I lost one son about a year and a half ago and the second in April this year. My domestic affairs are not an have not been in a happy state and are, I am sorry to sa a constant source of worry to me. Only recently I got an urgent letter LVo- my jife, calling me home on leave in connection ,&gt;ith some household difficulties. The contents of the letter vere so pathetic to read and pained me so much. 3* ± feel that ay complaints are more or less chronic to my stay in t e Gulf and that the remedy lies not in my going on leave every now and then to recouperate and attend to domestic affairs (which is neither possible nor economical), but in a permanent''mutual transfer to India, if this could be managed. 4* I would therefore consider it a ^reat favour If you will be kind enough to recomend me to the Hon*hie the Political Resident for referring my above request to suitable ouarters in India. I would feel greatly obliged if this cpube done as early as possible as I am most anxious to visitTfo attend to the affairs mentioned in para 2 above and do not feel justified in applying for leave to do this&lt;, as I have Just returnedfrom leave. 6. As one of the possibilities, may I suggest that there is a vacancy in the Central India States Residency, Indore, ae-a in consequence of Mr.Mohd.Ahmad Khan's (of the Publicity Office) deputation here. He is willing - in fact anxious - to secure a permanent Job in the Gulf Residency and surrender his lien on the Indore Residency clerical caire. He has been working in the Publicity Office for sometime now^and the question of uncertainty as to suitability of the new^who might be offered in exchange does not arise in the case of ^r.Ahmad, as the Publicity Officer could be asked for a report. There should be no difficult^ in securing a new man for the Publicity Office, as the establishment there is all on-temporary footing and for the duration of the ar. This would very much simplify the mattfer^ andlbeg-that if the Publicity Officer is agreeable I d sparing Itr.Ahmad Khan,you /ill kindly recommend a reference to the Resident Indore % by Bushire, if possible, by telegraph at my expense^ ^ I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, St.^SSfHhUiA' (V .s .sharma, Offg.Head Clerk, Political Agency,Bahrain).. •@ No. C/1203 'r Political Agency, Bahrain, 31st -Beeember 1941 To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Major Alban was willing at first to request Bushire for a telegraphic reference to the proper quarters, in view of the delays in the sea^mail services. On second thought he said it would he better to suggest a telegram later when the matter had had its preliminary consideration at Bushire. This has happened and as the steamer services are so disorganised and sea mail letters take so long from here to Bushire and from Bushire to other destinations, I venture to ask the favour I have requested above. 15. T 'beg humbly to state that my health has deteriorated very considerably. My last leave, from which I returned in November,1941, was on grounds of Neuresthenia. This I am pained to say is slowly but surely coming back to me. The separation from my family and a very lonely life at the house, the wrong type of food here and an unwholesome climate are affecting me adversely.

I am most grateful for the Secretary's kind recommendation, but feel that unless 1 can go on leave and then persuade some clerk to agree to a transfer to the Gulf Residency in exchange for me, the outcome of the application may not be much, if any at all, as in the midst of extraordinary pressure of urgent work in all Department on account of the 7ar the letter recommending my transfer is not likely to receive much attention, as explained in paragraph 3 of my application of 12th April my health has deteriorated very considerably and I am most anxious that the transfer materialises as soon as possible. 2.

The Government of India promised to send on to us any replies received from local authorities offering 4e a vacancy or otherwise. They have now written to say that the Government Departments have no vacancy to offer me. I there fore feel driven to fall back upon the offer received from the British Legation, Nepal of an appointment under them. The Legation offered to start me at Rs.95/-p.m. plus Rs.15/-compensatory allowance. This, as you ^ill agree, is not much of a start after my over ten years service in the Persian Gulf, but as the climate here has not suited my health, I have thought it best to finally accept the post. I therefore respectfully request that you will kindly suggest tor the Hon f ble the Political Resident f s favourable'consider -tion to Kindly telegraph to the British Minister Nepal conveying my acceptance and recommending if possible to give me a better start and secondly to grant me short leave (say months) preparatory to joining the new post.

I ask this lor no other reason except that of climate, which there is decidedly dry and healthy. As I have frequently sutmitted Bahrain climate is damp and pre-disposes me to neuresthenia, of which I ha^e oiten complained. I was at Kuwait for over five years, but never had this complaint. I am willing to pay for my own transfer and iorgo the T.A. as this would be a transfer at my own request. 2 # I humbly pray that you will kindly do me this favour as the rpproach of hot weather makes me apprehensive J a serious decline in health. The present head Clerk at Kuwait is an excellent Accountant and so there would be no dislocation of routine by our mutual transfer either here or at Kuwait, vvhere I have worked for a long time. Perhaps you would be kind enough to take P.R.'s orders here on his reti-rn from Muscat. I most sincerely thank vou in a dv anc e. r \L*jsc/o Political Agency, Bahrain. 51.5.43.

Before the case is submitted to/ixcsM^, would you please let me kiow what replyc could we give if Bushire Site J ' d- J J' j'f.f ' f L ' ■ ^ J .' ^ ] J r '' J refuse the claim on the following lines:- (a) What was the necessity of introducing S»R, 126? (b) Were you not on joining time under F.R.l , 05(d) until the date you joined duty at Bushire? The fact that e you were given orders taxxEiRXxtxItoxkirg during the j- - currency of your leave to report for duty at Bushire, does noty mean that you were to report before the 3'• ' t _/ r ' -j 'J 3 1 J . 1 ' T i ' • rvr ' J 1 j : expiry of your lekve. The orders could not possibly reach a person in time if they are sent after the expiry of one's leave. There was nothing extra ordinary in this. (c) What special hardship is experienced by a person returning from leave if his T.A. is governed under S.R.144 and 126 when he is posted to some other station? 'M Supposing a person proceeds on leave from Bush-re and is reposted at Bushire and is given T.A. under S.P.144, similarly another person proceeds on leave from Muscat and is posted to Bushire on return of his leave (^ay 4 months on average pay) and is given T.A. under S.P.144 and 126? What financial loss the - ^ • latter suffer^ to entitle him to a T.A. as onIt is of course so helpful if your case changes the existing practice at Pushire, but I think before forwarding we mey be sure that we are not interpreting the rules to suit a single case only 1, S,R.126. . / Supplementary Rule 126, Is not applicable in Gulf, but it is applicable in India, as it does not entitle a Government servant to draw mileage allowance, It only gives the priviliges for the transportation of ^it from old station to^new station. In Gulf all Govt© servants are entitled to draw mileage allowance while proceeding on leave or returning from leave and it includes Rly. fare,steamer fare and road mileages etc), ^n India^yl^ ^ no Government servant is entitles to such allowances hence the necessity of this Rule arises. 2. Fundamental ^ule 105 (d). I was on joining time under P.R. 105(d) between Karachi and Bushire. P.R. 105(d) deals with the cases of joining time from a fixed point the remote locality and under this Rule the Governor G eneral in council has fixed certain station in Supply. Rule 294-A. A Govt, servant on transfer or on leave , when he will travel from a fixed point to the remote locality will be on joining time under F.R. 105(d) //• Orders are always sent to a Govt, servant jj^ on leave to reach him in time before the expiry of his ^ r leave that he has to report himself for duty at a certain Y* ^ ap/ \ station. My point is this that my head quarter was changed ^ ^ xhbw during the currency of my leave and in this connection ^ I- please refer to S.R. 2(l8). When a Govt. Servant is transferred from one station to another is granted 3 fares only because that he has to incur a certain amount of expenditure at the new station to settle^TTimself, whereas he was in a settled state at the ^ old station. Otherwise he should be paid single fare only or actual expenses which he will incur for journey etCo ^ ; Vv. , , y ' k dk '1. &lt;&gt;■ ■ &lt;^D 4r jr sk't^P /?■be grsnted to a government servant on medical eertificpt i^-is^ubject to a maximum of 8 months in all at a time vide proviso to F.R.81(b)(ii).

In the circumstances, I beg that my application for short leave to letch my family may very kindly be reconsidered t-hset so that I may go early in September by air and return before the end of the month by steamer, I have had a very urgent letter from my wife requesting me to fetch her as soon as possible. May I arrange for a passage by air and also write by air mail to my wife to come to Karachi accordingly? cXy&gt;^) ^ u3PS) I have handed over the cash balances etc, to Mr.Manian, I did so on the 19.9.43. Since then I have 'been explaining to him the accounts procedure of routine nature. Mr.Manian is very willing to learn and piek get the hang of the work, but he is badly handicapped by his lack of accounts experience, as he has never before in the Gulf done accounts work even in a subordinate capacity. This fact coupled with my failure to secure a passage to Karachi early enough to return to cope with the next month's accounts returns (which if the passage were forth coming in time I would have easily returned to deal with) makes it imperative for me to b«a beg that the question of posting as my temporary relief somebody with a grouding of accounts knowledge and one who can manage to deal with the work better than Mr.Manian is able to may kindly be favourably considered. As T have repeatedljky assured you and the P.A. my effort will be to return to duty by the very first available means of transport, but my experience of difficulties of securing passages from here and reports of even worse difficulties at the other end where almost the whole machineite^taken up for Military Officers travelliiu on duty leaves me less optimistic of returning early enough to cope with the monthly returns. Would you kindly therefore put this up for a favourable consideration. I conld then explain any points peculiar to our Bahrain Agency accounts to the new man who is selected to do the work.
