Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain# ; ■ ,Political Ageftcy, D«0» Bahrain, the 10th August 19S7# Y/ith reference to our conversation regarding the settlement of Mirsa Jasslm^s debts, I am sending for your perusal a statement showing the monthly payments which I have persuaded him to make to his creditors. He is receiv ing Hs# 245/- per month, excluding Hs# 50/- on account of house rent to b--. rithheld by us and also excluding Hs« 40/- which he is paying towards an advance from his General Pro vident Fund. The suggestion meted out to him that we would de duct the amount of monthly instalments from his pay and deliver to the creditors through the Court does not appeal to him as he is afraid that this would give him greater disparagement than ever. He has, however, suggested that he may be allowed to make the payments direct without our intervention and I have agreed to it on the condition that only Hs« 140/- would first be paid to him out of his pay every month and the balance kept with the Accountant until ■ * such time as he has actually made the payments and showed the receipts to me. I have given him a copy of the attached statement and have kept one for my reference. If you consider that these arrangements are not satisfactory and suggest any improvements I shall be very grateful to arrange ac oordingly. As for the ensurance of his incurring no further liabilities to the shop-keepers, I have suggested to them Captain T. Hickinbotham, I#A., Political Agent, Bahrain, On recess ^t Karachi.—2— indirectly that this practice should not be encouraged any longer. If he manages to find new creditors from among the less known traders I am afraid we have no means at our disposal to keep an effective check on it. I can, however, be on the look out that he does not relapse into indebtedness- The famous Bahrain heat coupled with suffocating cjoisture has ^ust started and we have had three days of r continuous spell. On the 3th the maximum temperature was 10S.1 0 and humidity 70% and on the 3th, although humidity fell to 64$, the temperature rose to a maximum of 105.

I stood first and another man came second to me and was taken to work temporarily as Laftari in the Indian Assistant's Cour^ which post is permanent but not pensionable. Now the New Head Munshi has arrived and asumed charge of his duties in this Agency, my services were dispensed with, with effect from the date of his taking over charge. Your kindness will no doubt appreciate that as I meritoriousely passed the examination held for the post now occupied by the man who came second to me,; I deem myself fully entitled to fill the same, i.e., post of Daftari. As regards the salary, I am willing to accept Rs. 115/- per mensem, which salary was drawn by the former Daftari and who has since been discharged. I may add that my qualifications, education and experience justifies my claim to fill the said post on the above salary, my salary as temporary Third Munshi was Rs 155/- per mensem.

I shall be grateful if K.S. Mirza Ismail can be ordered to refund the amount of 450/- without any further delay. Owing to the period of time that has elapsed I doubt whether any action can be taisen against the Khan Sahib for what at least amounts to gross neglect of duty tout I suggest a record be made in his record of service. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. T.Hickinbotham. Captain, I. A., Political Agent &amp; H.B.lw^s Consul, Muscat.Copy of a letter dated the 2nd August 1938 from the XrtfettUry Officer, Muscat to K.S.Mirza Ismail. One Shaaban Habib Eamdan has produced a receipt dated 24/i2/ / 1932 for dollars 500/- which has been signed by you. It is said that this xr amount was deposited by Shaaban for credit to the Estate of Caverji Kensi deceased. From the file it appears that Shaaban was appointed as one of the Administrator of the Estate, and according to his statement, he was called upon to deposit this amount, when he himself was declared bankrupt. I have seen the file and the deposit account register but do not find any mention of this or like amount therein. Alx the creditors of the Estete in question declare on oath that they have received no money on account of their claims against the Estate. Prima facie it would loolc that the amount in questioi was received by you but not credited to the account to which it belonged and that it remained with you unpaid. I might however mention for your info mation tnat a aum of # 50/-* has apparently been paid by you to one iChalfan bin Nasir who admits to have received this amount, fhe authority to pay this amount appears to be given by the Punchayat but not approved by the P.A., Will you please enUl&amp;hten me on tne subject so that I may explain to P.A. the facts which may be icnown to you but to no one here. Please treat this as urgent.j^J Copy of a letter daled the 9.9.38 from K.S. MirZ^Tsmail to Treasury Officer^ Muscat. On receipt of your letter of 2/8 I asked you to let me icnow about 0^0 or two joints and as I did not receive any answer I haateiied to write this letter. As you know many people used to bring money concerning oases etc. for deposit. The practice has always been to get a peon to count the money and pass them tc the Treasury. On many occasions when the T.C. or the Treasury Clerk stated that they were busy and refused to pass receipts I used to give temporary ones. Prima facie it would look that I had swallowed the money, but if I had really anything to do with it I could have easily replaced it before leaving Muscat, as I had sufficient funds to do so. As you know a fact many things were done by me by verbal orders of the P.a. for which I could not dare to ask for written instructions. Alter such a long time it is not possible for me to aocuse any one but to blame myself for my carelessness. I am leaving the matter to you to decide in any way you deem fit. I would be very grateful to you if you would would me in this matter and release me from this unexpected entanglement.Copy of a letter dated the 24th September from the Treasury Officer. Muscat to K.S, Mirza Ismail, Many thanks for your letter of 9th September, I have not received your previous letter which you say you sent me in reply to my letter of August 2nd, I don»t know what nappened to it. In view of what you say I am unable to suggest anything whichmay be helpful to you, I Know you very well and can never think of you making use of funds kept with you in trust but that is not sufficient to save you from the unfor tunate laibility in which you have been involved due to your own carelessness. It is qui teat evident from the receipt that the amount was received by you and its no mention in the Deposit Register which is kept by the Treasury Officer shows that it was never paid to the Treasury Officer. Moreover you paid 50 dollars to one of the creditors after the amount was received by you which shows you had funds belonging to t the Estate with you. tfhat happened later on is not clear. All the creditors except the one whose receipt of ^ 50/- is one the file say that they did not receive any payment from the Bstate although they had approached you on several occasions, as some of them are respectable merchants it is not possible to diabexieve them, if you cannot recollect anything about the disposal of the money in question nothing can be done. Can't you remamber whether you had any dollars left with you when you left Muscat and if so it would be easy to come to the conclusion that you had those dollars on account of some Estate. If not you will no doubt remember that happened to $ 460/- which is a big amount and as dollars are not current for our office use they could not have been used for amy other purpose. What you say about carrying out Political Agents instructions without their written orders as far as it concerns money matters will not be acceptable.If you are unable to give a satisfactory explanation I would suggest that it should be oaid up, sooner the better, as the present rate is Ss 95/- per 100/- dollars which is a very favourable rate to you.Copy of a letter Ko. nil dated the 16.10.38 frolTiC.S. Mirza Ismail to the Treasury Officer, Muscat# I am extremely grateful for your letter of 24th September. I cannot remember anything about the money and believe me that I had no public money with me .vhen I i left Muscat* I bought some dollars one or two days before leaving (I do not remember how much) when I heard that the dollars ^ere more current in iCuwait than the rupees. On board the ship when I heard that the cost of each dollar was As. 9-10 in Kuwait I wanted to return the dollars to Muscat but I got a chance to land at Bahrain and dispose of them there. Now I am waiting for your reply because I have to raise the fund by borrowing from some one. Please let me know as soon as possible what I am to do as I have been fed up with this life.No. 1189-1/29.
