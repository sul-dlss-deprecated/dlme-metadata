S. » Joint 3ec,retary to the Oovern:nent of India, His majesty's Under Secretary df State for India, 'S con0.nic and Oversea s Depa rtment, India office, Whitehall, London. Subject;- Question of levying lightdues at Bahrein from the vessels of the Bahrein petroleum Company. Sir, I am directed to say that in view of the establish ment of the Bahrein petroleum Company at Bahrein the 3-overnment of India have had under consideration the question of the levy of Persian Gulf lightdues on vessels which call at Bahrein but do not proceed to or arrive from the ports of Aba dan and Basrah« . r , (&gt;1 1 ^ | jt/t-.TjTf.Tin I'n m rtjtar r.rji nn i n jnm 2 # According to the existing procedure lightdues in the Persian Gulf are levied and collected only in respect of vessels arriving at and departing from the ports of Abadan and Basrah. This procedure was adopted in 1925 because the number of ships using the lights in the Persian Gulf but not calling at either Abadan or B a s rah was estimated to be negligible and also because of the difficulty likely to be experienced in collecting the dues at ports other than Abadan and Basrah. The position, has, however, now altered materially in view of operations of the Bahrein petroleum Company and it is estimated thata numbeijof ships will in future be calling at Bahrein which will not proceed to or arrive from the ports cf Aba dan and 'Basrah. It has accordingly been suggested thctt light dues should be levied and collected from such ,\l0 vessels at Bahrein and this suggestion is supported by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 5. The Government of India have endeavoured to ascer tain the tonnage 01 vessels likely to be calling at Bahrein in connection with tne operations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, but have been unable to obtain any accurate forecast. It is, however, anticipated that at least five tank-ships ./ill call at that port during the 'current year and that as the Company are expecting to produce about oOOO barrels of oil per day .the number of tank-ships likely to call at the port in subsequent years will be even grea ter. 4. The Government of India have also considered the procedure to be adopted for the levy and collection of the li~ghtdues at Bahrein in the event of the dues becoming leviable at that place and after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Flag officer Commanding, Royal Indian Iiavy, are of opinion that the responsibility for the levy and collection of the lightdues should devolve on the Port officer, Bahrein, if the GovernjjerrT'o'f Bahrein have no objection to his undertaking the duty. They have also considered the question of the rate at which the lightdues should be levied and are of opinion that even though it may be urged that vessels calling at Bahrein and not proceeding to Aba dan or Basrah use no lights west of Bahrein, the flat rate now pres cribed for all vessels liable to lightdues in the Persian Gulf should be prescribed also for vessels calling only at Bahrein. They, however, realise that the final decision on all these points must rest with His Majesty^ Govern ment and I am to request that, if the Secretary of State for India sees no objection, the matter may be placed. feJt fsk ONriUENTiAL GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

It is possible he may be averse from modifying the present system of levying dues, at any rate for the maintenance of route lights, in the 3hatt-el-Arab only. 3• If it is eventually decided to adopt the Government of India's suggestion, it will clearly be necessary, before introducing the new arrangements, to secure the consent of the party chiefly affected, namely the Bahrein Petroleum Company, since the present system rests primarily on the consent of the interested parties (as/ 9 9 H,L. Baggallay ? Esq, Foreign Office, COPY SENTr 2 (as represented originally by the Chamber of Shipping and subsequently by the Bombay Advisory Committee) and a new departure of this kind, affecting an interest not hitherto concerned ? should presumably be based on the same principle. The Company will no doubt agree that they should contribute a fair share to the upkeep of the lights which they use - though they may 9 I suppose, claim representation on the Committee and they may not agree that the full Basra rate should be charged at Bahrein. 4, Apart from general considerations it muld, in any case 9 be desirable to obtain the prior consent of the Company in view of the fact that the light dues could only be collected under the authority of the Bahrein Government, who, however, have recently promised (in connection with the setting up of a refinery in Bahrein and in return for certain concessions from the Company' to exempt the Company from payment of all taxes and dues in Bahrein except certain specified state and municipal taxes. It is possible, therefore, that there might be technical difficulty in enforcing the payment of light dues by ships which are the property of the Company if the Company were to refuse to pay, 5/ mk5. If you agree with paragraph 2 above, and subject to any observations by Grimshaw or by Seal, to whom I am sending copies of this letter, you will no doubt ask the Embassy at Bagdad to obtain Colonel Ward' views on the Government of India's letter» Yours sincerely.INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S .W. 1 P.Z.8403/35.

Will you please refer to your Express Letter of the 16th November, No.886-S/1935 covering an extract from the 'Iraq Times', reporting that an agreement had been reached between the representatives of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, the Koyal Dutch Shell Company, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the marketing of the petioleum output of the Bahrein Islands. We gather from Starling of the Petroleum Department that the report of an agreement is premature. A meeting undoubtedly took place in Mew York between representatives of the three groups mentioned, to consider the possibility of taking up the production of the California Standard Oil Company at Bahrein, and probably/ Hon b^e Lt.Col. T.C. Powle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.2 probably also Hasa. The Company, however, attached such high value to the prospects of their concessions and to the quality of the oil produced there, that it was Impossible to come to terms. The three groups are content to hold their hand for the moment, as they believe that the California Company will have difficulty over their marketing and will find that tiey have over-rated the quality of their prospective products, especially Kerosene.

I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter No. P.Z.8400/35 of the 2nd December about the proposal to levy light dues at Bahrain. 2. In principle we see no objection to the Government of India* s proposal, which is in itself, of course, quite reasonable. We also agree that Ward ought eventually to be consulted about it. But before we ask our Embassy at Bagdad to take it up Y/ith him, we think the following considerations ought to be taken into account: and it may be that they will lead us to the conclusion that it will be better to postpone approaching Ward until the general situation is rather clearer. 3. In the first place there is the question of the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ general and special rights with which you deal in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your letter. If the Company voluntarily agreed to the levy of light dues by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service all would of course be well. It would only be if the Gompany demurred . Clausen, Esq.© 2. to this that the question of a compulsory levy by, or by the authority of, the Sheikh might arise. We think that in that case the exemption from taxation which it is proposed to give the Company in their agreement with the Sheikh about the establishment of their refinery (see r ? -. 1 4 draft deed enclosed in India Office letter P.Z.8659/1930 of December 5th 1935; would have to be considered. The text oj . Article 111 is worded very comprehensively, it is possible uo argue that it does not cover dues levied by an officer of the Sheikh for a third party. But this: argument might not prevail, it would still be possible to amend the draft agreement before it is signed; but made we do not think any attempt should be/to do this except after very careful deliberation, .especially in view of the considerations set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 below. in any case it would probably be desirable to make a King 1 s Regulation under the Bahrain Order in Council to justify the levy of a due by an officer of the Sheikh on British ships. 4. in the second place the question will require careful watching in view of the fact that suggestions for a closer co-ordination of the arrangements for collecting3. .. ■■ light dues in t-he Gull' may possibly emerge as a resiil't of the impending Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention negotiations. It might be premature to fix on any scheme for Bahrain in advance of those negotiations; and it might, lor that matter, be even more premature to do so in advance ox the final transfer to Persia of the lights and buoys in Persian v/aters and of a final decision regarding the placing of a light vessel, possibly borrowed from Bahrain, at Farur shoal. It seems to us that it would be wise to settle these matters, if possible, before introducing a fresh complication into the Persian Gulf lighting problem. As you know, the Admiralty and Board of Trade are rather anxious as to the possibility of the Persian Government charging excessive dues in respect of the Gulf lights which they will be taking over, and the imposition of a new due by us, or by Bahrain, at this moment might conceivably make it easier for the Persians to put on new and higher dues themselves. 5. Thirdly, as you know, shipping developments at -v.. | |f| .. ^ Bahrain are always liable to be affected by developments on the Hasa coast. For example if the Standard Oil Company of California, which holds the Hasa concession, is thinking of developing a port at Ras Tanurah - as we believe/believe it is - any ill-timed imposition of light dues at Bahrain might conceivably tip the scale am end in a consiaeraole volume of shipping, which would otherwise use Bahrain, going only to Ras Tanurah instead. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal at the Admiralty and Grimshaw at the Board of Trade. Yours ever, (SI). ) LACY BAGGALLAY.(Sj) 9th February 1936 bushire re h(vt&lt; r ill you kindly refer to your deini-official letter NorlOlB-S dated the 19th December 1925 and to our conversation during your recent visit to Bahrain. 2. I have not been able to get definite proof of the comiminication between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company on the mainland by means of wireless and certain information which I now have tends to suggest that, thought they may have used their wire less in this way, messages usually come through the commercial wireless between Hasa and Bahrain. 5. I will make further enquiries as opportunity permits itself, but write to say that I do not think that we should take any action unless and until we can get more definite proof of misuse of their wireless by the Bahrain Petroleum Company.

Question of levying light dues at Bahrein. Please see demi-official letter dated 30th December from Foreign Office of which a copy was sent to you b,/ air mail on January 6th. After considering points raised by Foreign Office I am inclined to opinion that it '' 4 would be unwise to take any steps at present towards the institution of a levy at Bahrein. Apart from any other considerations Government of India will no doubt agree that risk of encouraging development of port on Hasa coast is a real one. The most satisfactory solution of the problem might be to request the Bahrein Petroleum Company to make an annual lump sum contribution towards the upkeep of the lights based on the tonnage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf and not proceeding to the Shatt-el-Arab, on the ground that theirs are the only ships that use the route lights without contributing to the fund. I presume it is still definitely the case that apart from the Bahrein Company's vessels the number of ships entering the Gulf without touching at Abadan or Basra is negligible. Such an arrangement v/ould of course include ships going to and from a Saudi port as well as Bahrein, and so would avoid risk referred to above.' - . - 4 / {Continuation Sheet.)

The new camp Is not yet complete aad construction work is being continued. Production during 1935 exceeded that of any previous year. A number of taniers called and lifted cargoes of crude petroleum from the Company's Sitm Bsimlnal. Production was regulated to meet the shipments, Curine the latter part of the year preliminary work was started for the erection of a refinery in Sections 9D and 15D. Work was also started on enlargement of the Company's oil gathering system, and the drilling program was somewhat accelerated. These activities made it necessary to increase the number of employees.

V/ith CO-^pan^' Seeks an impoi'tant Share in Foreign Crude Markets. .ap i, ci .:Uvpans i on Seen. lavalry with Bow jeruey Concern Found Extended. r J,.^oiiiLkins. Stanaara Oil company of California, which lor some time has been unsuccessiully s^ekin^ a share of foreign oil markets for its Bahrein island (Persian Gulf) properties, is about to achieve its objective chrou^h an important deal with the Texas Company, leading maepenaent, according to well posted sources. Uegotiationa are in progress, it is said, whereby California ;standard and I'exas will enter into an agreement providing lor utilization of the Bahrein reserves, calculated by engineers to be in excess of 600,000,000 barrels even at their current early stage of development# Texas company engineers, it is believed, wxll complete a survey of the properties soon. While details of the proposed agreement ^re not available, it is believed that Texas company would be jointly interested in California standard's new Bahrein refinery and would supply the extensive selling outlets required. Expansion/i^ipans i o n H i' a la e d « ■1'he reported transaction places emphasis on the aggressive maimer in which both companies have embarked on international expansion policies. The fexas Coiiipany has been prominently mentioned in the ne.s recently as joint buyer, with Socoriy- Yacuum Oil Company, ox' an approximately BO per cent interest in the famous Barco oil concession in Colombia from Gulf oil (Mellon) interests, in announcing the consummation 01 this transaction T.Heiber, chairman, and ,v,g .S.alodgere, president of Texas company, and officials of Socony-Vacuum, indicated that development work in the Barco tract would be carried out ^n a vigorous manner; facilities Wvuld be provided lor reiinin^' and marketing biie oil, and pipe lines and other transportaoion means established# Texas Company and socony-Yacuum had previously buen partners in an oil refinery in iir^entina and also are interested in j eruvian oil lands, according to reports, Texas also has other potential oil produoiiig lands in Colombia adjacent to the Barco concession, Kew hivalry Seen . Of particular interest in connection with the reported California Standard-Texas agreement is the unuenied 2eport uh^t the former sought some time a^.o to effect an agreement with Standard Oil company of New Jersey and Royal Dutch -Shell group whereby Jereey and shell would take care of c-he Bahrein ouir;Uo ana enable California standard to realize on its investment. ;,hether or not this would indicate the formulation O j . a new competitive set-up of formidable proportions in foreign oil markets is a matter of conjecture# it would seem, however, that the two companies flull claim a fewod slice of the foreign business, which has been increasing rapidly m recent years. At the same time, they improve their/3* their position 'by obtaining oil supplies leas eubjectto proration re^uiat^ona, tax&amp;s and other iactors that apply to output 01 petroleum aud its derivatives j.n the United States, The arive by California Standard to obtain wider maricets has been the subject of consiaerable analysis by inaustrial writers in the lust year or more. ;} world petroleum' recently called attention to the company^ iniiarnational expansion program, an&lt; various authorities have predicted ~ since collapse ox the merger negotiations with Standard oil COiupany of Hew Jersey, that the California unit would have to be contended ./ith before lon^ in bidding for foreign business. Other Rights Obtained . Supplementary to its Bahrein Island concession, first obtained about five years a^o, California Standard obtained drilling rijbts in Eastern Saudi Arabia and is now engaged in exploration work there. previously, it explored possibilities of oil in Alaska, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and other areas with but indifferent success. In March the company entered into the 2?exas Gull Coast area by obtaining a lease to 6,000 acres of lexas public school lands. The deal, it was said, is a prelisiinaiy to more important operations m Texas and possibly Louisiana by the same concern. Sale of oil from the Bahrein properties of California Standard has been strictly limited up to the present time. r i 1 he company has shipped several cargoes irom Bahrein to Japan, where the government had been at odds with Standard- Vacuum and Sheil interests over Japanese oil laws adopted last year# whether any of the Bahrein oil has been sent to California/California Standard's refining interests in France is not definitely known* For some time it has, how ever, been shipping oil Irom its Kettleman Hills&gt; California, production to certain French refineries. In French oil circles it is stated that the company has either purchased outright or otherwise acquired a large financial interest in the Hafinerie de Berre, near Marseilles in the south of prance. in audition, it has been reported at various times that California Standard has been negotiating for Huss^an Oil Iroducts, Ltd., the Soviet marketing organisation in Great Britain. i £ntera Mexico . The company has been decidedly non-committal with respect to those reports, whi-le admitting that the oil situation abroad is be in,, closely watched by company i^eprosentatives and engineers. Olxxcially, however, expansion of California Standard operations in Mexico, where the Hew Jersey Standard, through its subsidiaries, has been long established, is confirmed. in 19.J5, according to California Standard's annual statement, j{33,708,640 was expended on construction and the acquisition of properties, of which jfci5,073,5£6 represented production. The report disclosed a net increase of JflO,9B4,l£^ m f^xed asoets. The actual extent to which Texas Company has expanded its facilities abroad, as'well .:s its future intentions in this respect, are largely matters of conjecture. Under lormer managements, only passing attention was given to the 10reign picture because of Lhe plentiful supplies of oil in tins country and necessity for fully integrating the domestic orgaaination.

June 1936. oijL ^lS / I enclose a copy of a note regarding a conversation with Mr.Ballantyne on the subject of (a) the Unallotted Area of Bahrein, and (h) the marketing arrangements being made by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As regards (a), we must presumably leave the Bahrein petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited to fight it out with the Sheikh. As regards (b), Mr.Ballantyne pointed out that it was not for him as a servant of the Company to suggest that His Majesty's Government might want to make any requests to the Company or comment on their scheme, but the Company were particularly anxious that His Majesty's Government should be fully informed, and it occurred to him that it would be in the best ultimate interests of the Company that His Majesty's Government should be quite satisfied that their interests were not going to be adversely aitected by RendelEeq., C.M.G., the/ reign Office.8« the importation of a new principle which might conceivably at some later stage lead to undesirable complications, I understand that the Texas Company are themselves a most respectable organisation and purely American &lt; Starling will be able, of course to confirm whether this is the «ase) but their importation into the Bahrein Company means that they will have a share not only in the marketing but also in the producing side of the business and this might presumably lead to further developments, e.g. if the Texas Company subsequently got attached to some other perhaps not American Company, (perhaps Japanese) which might not be desirable from His Majesty's Government's point of view. It might be worth considering whether we should intimate to the Bahrein Petroleum Company that while His Majesty's Government quite appreciate that it is necessary for the Company to make arrangements to market its oil (ami this is all to the good so far as the Sheikh's revenues as-e concerned) His Majesty's Government view with som5&gt; disquiet the introduction of new interests into the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and they look to the Company to ensur# by some/3. some appropriate means that His Majesty's Government are safeguarded from the possibility of further outside bodies acquiring interests in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. They would, for instance, suggest that provision might be made thereby none of the share capital of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could be alienated without the consent of His Majesty's Government, and that the capital could not be increased without similar consent. This of course is a very tentative suggestion for consideration. The papers are being referred to our Legal Adviser for his observations and in the meantime I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether you have any observations to offer on the scheme or on the line that His Majesty's Government might take in regard to future safeguards» It is, of course, possible that if the Bahrein Petroleum Company get the unallotted area in Bahrein, the main lease will have to be amended to cover the new holdings That may be an opportunity for putting in any safeguards that might be decided upon in the present connection? Mr.Ballantyne is, of course, anxious for an early reply. 1/\ I am sending a similar letter to Starling and Seal jgcL &gt;■ &gt;' v|) / y p. 2 .4298/36« gOl^IDENTI AL. Bahr ein Oil , Note of a conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on 19th June 1936. Mr. Ballantyne called yesterday afternoon on his return from San Francisco where he has been conferring with the principals of Standard Oil of Galimornia. He hao. two points to raises (i) The unallotted area . He said that the Company had definitely decided to acquire the unallotted area &gt; and instructions have been sent to Skmner, the chief local representative, accordingly. He is to enquire from the Bahrein Government what procedure is necessary to deal with the matter in view of the Sheikh's absence. The Company are hopeful that they may be able to make an o±fei to the Sheikh which may clinch the matter definitely. I said that this., of course, is a matter for the Sheikh and that H.M.G. have, as he knows, been quite neutral in the matter all along. My impression was that ohe negotiations would probably have to mark time until the Sheikh returned to Bahrein, as it was unlikely that His Excellency would have time or be prepared to do anything while he wao in this country, and it would clearly not be possible to do much Bahrein in the absence of the Sheikh. Mr. Bal -antyn that would quite suit the Company and that in an^ ca Mr. Skinner would be reporting to them shortly. (2) Marketing . Referring to certain press statements which had been made recently (one of which I had mentioned to Mr. Hamilton when/v/ 2. when he called here the other day). Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company were in the final stages of negotiation with the Texas Company for the conclusion of a marketing arrangement. The Texas Company have a wide organisation in (1 think) India, Africa, Australia and South Arabia^ and will be able to dispose of as much oil as Standard Oil can produce both in Bahrein and on the mainland of Arabia, The original idea was to have a holding company in London, but after carefully considering the question of income tax in England, the United States and Canada, the Company had come to the conclusion that the soundest and most economical method of setting up the marketing organisation was not to create a new company, but to extend the functions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to cover the marketing as well as the production of oil. The scheme is that half the share capital of the Company will be acquired by the Texas Company. The Bahrein Petroleum Company will continue to exist precisely as at present constituted and all that would happen would be a redistribution of capital, either by an increase of the capital or by the sale of some of the existing capital. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company wished to have no secrets from H.M.G. and, though Ihey were, of course, under no legal obligation to do so, were anxious that HoM.G. should be fully informed of the arrangements that were in contemplation. It might be that H.M.G. might have some comments to make from their own point of view and, of course, if so, the Company would be prepared to give them careful consideration.

Z• 4298/36) regarding the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I note v/hat the Company have decided to do with regard to the unallotted area. As regards marketing arrangements, the Texas Company is a substantial and reputable concern, and purely American controlled, with marketing organisations in various parts of the East. It is not associated with the big oil groups, o but while preserving its independence, it is in fairly close touch with those groups and I gather is regarded as being on reasonably friendly terms. I have made one or two discreet enquiries as to the views of the big British Companies on the marketing of Bahrein oil because, as I think you know, there were some talks between the big groups and the Standard of California a short time ago which broke down. Broadly, the view is that, short of a direct arrangement with the Standard of California, there are certain advantages from their point of view in a company like the Texas handling the oil since it will flow into those channels where they normally trade. There will thus be a minimum of disturbance of markets which is all to the good from the point of viow of - British oil interests. As regards the question whether we can do anything in the way of securing any further safeguards lor H.M. Government, I think we are on difficult ground to try to insist on any new Clausen Esq., Ld ia Office.^ conditions/2. conditions now, unless your legal advisers were of opinion that to admit the Texas Company to a half share of the capital 'brought Article XIII into operation. So far as a new concession is concerned, I think our hands are free to consider any icascnahle nevv conditions, 'but we should have to 'be careful not to put forward anything to the Bahrein Petroleum Company which we would not equally suggest to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in which there are British, French, American and Dutch interests* We carried the matter as far as we could when the existing British Control clause was inserted, and the only suggestion which occurs to me at the moment is that we might, as Mr.Ballantyne has asked whether w# have any views, possibly suggest that the Company should giv* us an undertaking that they will not, without our consent, enter into any arrangement which would result in control of the Company being secured by a concern in which American and/or British interests did not hold at least 50 per cent.of the share capital. This is on the assumption that the Bahrein Petroleum Company is to b e allowed to have the remainder of Bahrein. There is, however, the possibility that H .M. Government may consider it desirable to suggest to the Sheikh that it might be a good thing to give the remainder of Bahrein to Petroleum Concessions Ltd» Once the Bahrein Petroleum Company gets the whole area it will probably increase the diffi culty of any arrangement being come to between the Standard of California and the other big groups (which really means the Iraq Petroleum Company) over this territory with the object of securing a measure of British control. I appreciate the difficulty and in view of the issues involved it might be as well if we were to have an inter/inter-departmental discussion on the whole matter^ Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) F.G, STARLING.

Sir, I have the honour to state that during the past ten days I have had interviews with the Chief Local Representative and the Resident Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company at the last of which you yourself were present on trie subject of oil gauging. S, I understand that as in the past only crude oil was heing shipped the 'Run Tickets' to the ships were also the tickets on which royalty to the Shsiitu is pcid. For vari l reasons familiar to the State Engineer the 'Outage' aethoa cannot now be used and the 'Innage' method it necessary j to take separate gauges for royalty oil and offshore loadings The Bahrain Government is only interested in v .itnessin, gauges for Royalty purposes. The Principals of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have now informed the Resident Manager tnat the signature of a third party will be required for all offshore shipments i.e. for all -Run Tickets'. There is no firm in Bahrain in a position to carry out this work. During the past month Mr. Steele, the State Engineer has been . causing for the Company as a personal witnessing tne otf shore 0 c.u 0 x b i--jTro signing the necessary documents, favour in nis spare time si 0 / The CompanyThe Company consider that to ea^loy a European Referee would be an unwarranted expense and they are of opinion that the Host satisfactory arrangement would be for the Bahrain Government to undertake the work of neutral referee. 3. At the first meeting last week the Company informed me that by the beginning of Hovember the gauging on behalf of the Company alone would be more than one man could accomplish and later I confirmed this from Steele. Their suggestion then was that they should ask the Bahrain Government to undertake the gauging as neutral referee and that the actual gauging would be supervised by Mr. Steele. The Company would compensate the Bahrain Government at the rate of fe.lS /8/- a gauge taken on their behalf ana naturally the Bahrain Govern ment would in turn compensate the State Engineer. If you remember I discussed this matter with you and Mr. Steele informally and it only remained for the Company to put forward their proposal in writing for agreement to be xkeis accorded by the Bahrain Government. The principal reason for this temporary arragement was to enable the permanent Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, to deal with any permanent arrangement that would be necessary on his return from leave. However, the situation has now been altered by the fact that the Company have informed me that their production of refined products is being increased so rapidly that a full time ganger will be essential to cope with the work within six to eight weeks. This information was conveyed by letter on 4th August by the Chief Local Representative. At the inter views various schemes to meet the situation were discussed. 4. The Resident Manager has now suggested that the Bahrain Government undertake the gauging and. (a) employ one or more hign class Indians under the supervision of the State iugineer or / (b) I(b) engage an Assistant to the State Engineer or an independent Engineer to gauge for both parties• the Company consider that the ganger need be only of average intelligence but he should ¥^ork under the superintendence of a man experienced in the handling of oil, such as the present State Engineer, The Company consider it advisable for the gauger to be an employee of the Bahrain Government and suggest that they and the Bahrain Government share tne cost in accordance with the number of gauges taken for each party, or according to any arrangement agreed upon by both parties. You have now a clear proposition put forward by the Company and 1 suggest that you get in touch without delay by air aail with Mr, Belgrave, whose advice I consider it would be highly desirable for the Bahrain Government to have, and after due consultation inform me for the information of the Company what action the Bahrain Government propose to take. I understand that Mr. Belgrave hes been in touch with the Company's representatives in Kngland and is probably in a position to advise a course of action immediately. I believe that Mr. Steele is able to give expert advice on the gauging and that he will be able to advise on the probable financial distribution of payment for the extra stafi engage. I sKi ^n he will be able to point out if the Goajpany or the Government will be called on to pay for the greater number of gauges and thereby shoulder the greater part of the increased financial burden. I um sure you will realise the urgency of the sltuatfc and will do your best to let me have a reply without delay*. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. (SD.) T. HICKINBOTHAM Captain, Offg. Political Agent, Bahrain.I'aT) m i| I Copy of letter No.PA-605 dated the 4th August 1956 from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Lindted, Bahrain, to His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Please refer to our recent conversation at The Agency, at which Mr. E.A./Skinner, the Resident Manager was present. Our letter No.589 was referred to, which explains that existing conditions make it necessary to use the ,^ innage ,, method instead of the 'outage 11 method. Previously, as only crude was being shipped, the Run Tickets to the ships were also the tickets on which royalty to the Shaikh is paid. For various reasons familiar to the State Engineer, the ^outage' method cannot now he used and the 'innage 11 method makes it necessary to take separate gauges for royalty oil and off- c . shore loadings. The Bahrain Government is only interested in witnessing gauges for royalty purposes, hut our prXnciplals have o-dviseo. that a Third Party signature v/ill he required for all offshore shipments. There is no firm ±n Bahrain who could —— satisfactorily undertake this work. It would he an unwctrrant^( expense to bring in a European Referee. Sonner or later, as the refinery makes more products, there will be more crude run- daily to the refinery and more offshore shipments, which means that a Bahrain Government Inspector will probably have to be on call at all hours of the day and night. In our discussion it was suggestedi (l^ That the ^tate Engineer should witness the offshore shipments and sign the Marine Delivery Tickets as well as the Royalty Tickets. (2^ That the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited would pay a nominal sum for each time gauging is witnessed and each time a Run Ticket is signed. The amount /suggested forsuggested for this was Es.15/8. In a second conversation yesterday with Mr. Skinner also present, it was pointed out: a) That the number of gauges is increasing much more rapidly than anticipated. (2^ That in view of (l) it will only be a short time before a full-time gauger is needed (probably six to eight weeks). (3.) That such a gauger need be only a man of average intelligence but that his work should be under the supervision of one who is thoroughly familiar with the whole system of handling oil, such as the present State Engineer. Mr. Skinner pointed out that a special European Referee would be expensive even though he could witness gauge; for both the Company and the Government. He thought it more advisable: (l^ To use one or more high-class Indians under the supervision of the State Engineer, or (2) For the Bahrain Government to bring in either an assistant to the State Engineer or an independent Engineer to take care of the gauging for both parties. (3) For such a person to be an employee of the Bahrain Government, and for the Bahrain Government to be reimbursed by the Company according to the number of gauges taken for the Company or according to any arrangement agreed upon by both parties.

His Majesty's Government have always been particularly anxious that, in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII of the Bahrein Petroleum Companys lease, the maximum possible number of British Subjects should be employed by the Company in Bahrein. The periodic returns submitted by the Company are kept under scrutiny, and it was noted with satisfaction that the proportion of employees in Class I improved, between January 1934 and October 1935, from Americans 20 - British 8 to .Americans 21 - British 15. Thus although the majority of Class I posts were still held by American citizens, the proportion of British Subjects appeared to be gradually increasing, and the position was therefore not too unsatisfactory frcro the point of view of His Majest y's G overnment. Since then the construction of the Refinery has of course resulted in the temporary employment of about an equal number (according to the statement of 1st April 193 6) of/of Americans and British in Glass I. (49 and 51 respectively). On the other hand, it would appear from the statement of April 1st that in the permanen t staff in Class I there has 'been a considerable swing in the direction of American preponderance. The proportion appears to be Americans 47 - British 25 (with practically all the senior posts held by Americans). This state of affairs has caused seme uneasiness and we feel justified in drawing the attention of the company to the position which has developed. We venture to hope that it may be possible to give some reassurance on the subject. Yours sincerely, gd.) M. J. GLAUSON( ^ 496l/«56« XiMiixA 0- * f ii x.4.»L.

Mr. Ballantyne called on September 2i+th and raised two points in connection with the marketing of Bahrein oil. He said that the Company were hoping to market some of their oil in the Phillipine Islands and another part in Indo-China. These were s so far as he knew? the only territories in which difficulties might arise in regard to preferential duties. He understood from his principals in San Pranoisco that for oil products going into French or Phillipine territory it would make a difference whether the shipment Y /as from British territory or not since there was in both cases a preferential tariff for British goods. I informed Mr. Ballantyne that for the purpose of section 21 of the Import Duties Act 1932 the Bahrein islands are regarded as 'territory under His Majesty's protection' and therefore that Bahrein products imported into this country receive the 'benefit of the prelerential oarill duties applied to Empire goods. Presumahly this fact would 'be accepted hy the Phillipine and Indo-Chinese customs authorities as entitling Bahrein Oil to j^iitish preferential tariff. Mr. Ballantyne agreed that this Wdo probably so and that he might tackle the matter on those lines. He went on to refer in the same connection to the question how certificates of origin should he obtained for shipments of Bahrein oil which mignt he impo-ted int foreign territories. His principals in San Francisco had suggested that an arrangement might he made wherehy employees 4-&gt;•»/&gt;n ^TiTp Pnrrmanv would be made Honorary of the Bahrein Petroleum Company wuuxu.

I they should issue certificates of origin for use in the countries to which the oil was 'being shipped. I informed Mr. Ballantyne that this was quite out of the question as the Sheikh of Bahrein was by treaty debarred from receiving representatives of any s, 'uiiw ■&gt; WV ►■VVV VVt*S^1Vl.'Vu; Governments other than His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government would certainly not allow any infringement of their treaty rights in this connection. I ■bhirik that so far as I knew there would be no difficulty in such certificates being issued by the Political Agent and my impression was that this procedure was already normal in Bahrein. I promised to consult Colonel iowlsi and/or Mr, Balgrate ? and let Mr. Ballantyne know whether my presumption was correct. Mr. Ballantyne agreed that prima facie sucn an arrangement would be quite suitable. All thau was wanted was definite proof of origin for the purposes of the customs authorities 's&amp;xL the importing couiii.r^&lt; M.J.

Dear Mr. Glauson J J. refer to your letter to me P. Z. 5382/36 of August lUth concerning the employment of British Subjects at Bahrein. The Gompany understands that the criticisms in such letter are 'based upon its Roster of Employees as of the 1st April 1936 and that such criticisms have reference only to the t, perrnanent n staff of Glass I employees. The figures you quote in paragraph 2 of your letter include drillers, there being 29 of these men among the U7 Americans you refer to. The number of drillers eniployed by the Bahrein Petroleum Gompany must from time to time depend upon the current drilling programme in Bahrein. This programme has throughout the short period of the Gompany' s development been very heavy, and recently it has been very much extended to deal with the anticipated demands of the refinery that is being constructed on Bahrein Island. It is for this reason that a number of additional drillers were sent to Bahrein this year. It is not anticipated that this strenuous drilling programme will be continued much longer. Upon its cessation most of the 29 drillers will leave Bahrein - perhaps only 3 or h will remain for normal operations. Furthermore, there are 6 British men who have been employed as apprentices to be trained as Refinery Opcrauors,# As they were sent out during the period of construction for additional experience, their names appear under that heading/heading (see page 6 of the Roster), These men are 'permanent' 1 employees. From the foregoing there emerge two facts, the first 'being that the drillers cannot he regarded as members of the 'permanent' staff of the Company excepting, perhaps, those engaged in the normal progress of drilling after the extraordinary drilling programme has 'been completed. The second fact is the number of employees shewn as 'permanent staff' on the 1st April 1936 cannot be regarded as being more than 22 American Subjects whereas the British personnel numbered 31? comprising 25 shewn on page U and the last 6 men shewn on page 6 of the Roster of 1st April 1936* It might be added that when the present drilling programme is completed it will probably be found unnecessary to retain the services in Bahrein of the Drilling Superintendent. The number of Drilling Foremen will probably then be reduced to one. For your information the Company would say that satisfactory British drillers are very difficult to find; in any event, the demands made upon the Company to develop the oil resources of Bahrein and to refine oil there have made it impossible for the Company to risk the drilling programme going wrong so Standard Oil Company men with / ; c t considerable drilling experience have been selected ■in &lt; - A f * t n m practically all cases. Might I now refer you to the Roster as of 1st &lt; j uly 1936? From this Report it appears that the Class I 'permanent staff 0 includes 31 British as against 28 Americans (excluding 21 of the 25 drillers who will probably be leaving Bahrein when the present extraordinary drilling programme has been completed). Moreover, of this group of Americans four are skilled/S-uillbQ. IvGi inery 0p6x , c3. oops v/lio s.pg gxpgctgd. 'fco Igcivg Bolipciri at the end of 1937 after they have trained a sufficient number of British employees for the posts. The Company Hopes that the foregoing information will dispel the uneasiness you refer to in your letter under reply and which has no doubt arisen through a misunderstanding of the real facts of the case. Despite its almost continuous heavy programme of work since tne commencernGribof its operations in Bahrein, the Company has consistently endeavoured, to increase the ratio of British to American permanent employees and as much care as possible has been taken to provide in the present refinery construction programme for the employment of permanent British employees.

C/63-10/1 22nd January Bahrain Oil* ) After dinner on the 18th January 1937 I had a talk with Mr. H.M. Herron, President of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and one of the foreign sales executives of the Texas Corporation, in which he gave me the following information. 2. I asked him about the life of the Bahrain field, , - ■ - — | explaining that I did scjbecause we had to advise the Shaikh about ^^^^atters and I did not want to see the revenue from oil used on expenditure which it might not be possible to keep up later on. The Bahrain Petroleum Company estimate the amount of oil available at present at one hundred million/ s e MFP—400S&amp;P—{M-480)— 26-141-2,00,000.', £** ~ 2 ~ }2f o , UArvv million barrels. They are, however, arranging to ^. alv-&gt; ' bore 'to 8000 feel: in order 'to find out. whether 'there r are any lower oil bearing horizons. If no further oil is found, they expect to be pumping in 1939 and estimate the life of the field at fifteen to twenty years. Mr. Herron, however, qualified the statement by saying that it was the most difficult thing in the world to estimate oil below ground. If they found deeper oil, it might raise the life to fifty or even Pc one hundred years I 3. This information emphasises the need for the Bahrain Government to conserve their revenue from x oil (see my letter No. C/490 dated the 17th November 1936). 4. Mr. Herron told me that they were up to now it in barges, but he did not know how the Sa'udi Arab Government would look at the proposal. He asked me if the proposal would be well received in Bahrain and I said that I thought that it would. 5. Mr. Herron states that by the time the Refinery is finished the Bahrain Btroleum Company will have incurred expenditure on the field of some where between two and two and an half million Sterling. &lt;5, Though his appearance has something of benevolence in it, 1 understand tnat Mr* Herron is the moving spirit of the Texas Corporation and is said to be extremely clever and full of drive, and swallows up likely oil-bearing territory wherever he/ disappointed over the oil in Jabal Dhahran, but were trying elsewhere.

BUSH IRE RESIDENCY. \ V records Bahrein Oil. WuiMiKinni &lt; .U&gt; , .nn .unm mau. Mr* Ballaiityne called on 1'ith April and discussed the request made in Mr. Walton's letter of the Hi-th July 1936 for certain assurances in regard to the control of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. (A copy of this letter was circulated to the interested Departments on 13th July, 1936, and sent 'by air mail to the Government of India? Bushire and Bahrein on the 12th September 1936). ^ Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company had given this mattex* careful consideration and quite sympatnised with the feelings of II.M.G-. as expressed in the earlier part of the letter. They were anxious to give some assurance^ to H.M.G.t hut they did not feel that they were in a position to give the specific assurances requested. They left it to Mr. Ballantyne to work out something which would he satisfactory to H. M .G. and which would also he possible for them to subscribe. 'X He explained that there were certain oh sections to the specific assurances suggested. In the first place the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Company, the present parent companies, are public companies and no control can he exercised over dealings in their shares. Any assurance hy the Board of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could not prevent changes in the control of the parent companies and therex ore an aouiauee of the Ifind suggested would not he of very rnucn use. Secondly, the Board of the B .P.C. would not in any case feel able to give an unqualified assurance of the kind suggested, principally because, while tne ; ro, e^u ^ruicl-. of Association of the Company give the Board compleue control/ ^q o-o cont.ro 1 v;ver mo^eraents of shares? 'the articles might 'be changea in such a way as to remove that power. The Board did not feel they could safely give an assurance that the Articles of Association would nev er be altered in this respect - though of course there is no intention whatever of altering them. Thirdly, and this I think was Mr. Ballantyne 's main ooint 9 an assurance of the kind suggested could easily be got round by the Company if they wanted to do so. -b'or instance, to take the case of the recent merger, the instead of giving half the shares to the Texas Company, might have made an agreement with them undertaking to let them have the whole produce of the Bahrein field, or something of that kind. This would really have had the same effect from the point of view of i.e. it would have brought another company very much into the Bahrein picture. If the company had 'been- a Japanese, German or Italian company, H.M.G. might have objected very much to the arrangement, but under the assurances at present proposed they would not have had any right to do so. It was not very easy to follow Mr»Ballantyne*8_ arguments, particularly the legal ones, but his real point is perfectly clear, viz. that any specific assurances of the kind suggested, even if the Company felt that they could safely subscribe to them, would not be really ^ mttom ■ effective from H.M.G. 1 s point of view. He suggested that what was really required was a general undertaking by the Company to respect the special interests of H.M.g -. in the Persian Gulf and to refrain from any action which would prejudice them- After some discussion we agreed that the simplest procedure might be for ¥ t . Ballantyne to reply to the letter of 14th July saying that the Company were sorry they could not give the specilic assurances requested and that we should then wri^e to Mr. Ballantyne saying that H.M.G. regTetted the Company were/were unable to do this, but that the Company should recognise that H.M.G. , both on historical and strategic grounds and in view of their special treaty relations with ae Arab Rulers, have special interests in the Persian Gulf area and that H.M.G. hope that in dealing with any matters connected with the control of the Company or of its policy and operations the Company would bear in mind these spe cial interests and take care to avoid any action which might in any way prejudice them. The point of this would be that the Company (who would, under this arrangement, acknowledge the receipt of our letter) would have permanently before them a general obligation to respect. H .M .G.'s special interests. This would involve consulting H .M.G. in advance if there was any proposal the effect of which might in any way infringe on these rights (e.g. if there were some suggestion of a combination with an Italian firm or the like). If the Company at some future time actually did something which prejudiced H.M.G.'s interests it would be open to H.M.G. to use their political oredominance in the Gulf to make the Company's position thoroughly uncomfortable ana the Company would not be able to complain in the light of the present correspondence. In fact, instead of having bound the Comnany with a legal agreement from which they would be quite capable of disentangling themselves if tney wished, H.M.G. would have bound the Company with an extra-legal understanding which would enable il.M.G-. in the event ot any breach to use the extra-legal weapons which their special position in toe Gulf, ana particularly in Bahrein, enables them to wield, (e.g. pressure through th e Sheikh or through the Political Agent by King s Regulations or the like). I told Mr. Ballantyne I would consult with the other- people// z : people concerned here and talk to him again later. (od.) M.J.
