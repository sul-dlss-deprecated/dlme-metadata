Consequently we could not be entirely confident that the already considerable Iranian ^ir Force might not be used for ^xis purposes and we would be most reluctant to see it numerically increased. Mr. Murray then spoke in sense reported in my telegram under reference. Since then we have received y our Inte l No: 174 and see from paragraph 3 and from print ~frTTt-Nfs—— Majesty’s Government intend to continue to permit ex port to Iran of aircraft material for the construction of Hurricanes. If this information were to reach the State Department without further explanation we feel that they might find it difficulty to reconcile it with arguments used to them against United States Government supplying aircraft to Iran. junerican Minister in Tehran will no doubt become aware of His Majesty s Gpvernment s policy in this respect and we would like to give State Department fullest explanation in advance of anything that United States Minister may report. In the course of his talk with Head of Near Eastern Division, Butler described Hav/ker’s factory as the second most concrete British interest in Iran after the ii.I.O.C; he said that it was of greatest importance that Shah should not replace our mechanics there POL.DEP^there with .jcis personnel, and that in this larger interest we had had to make concessions to the Shah as regards air materials which we could only most reluctantly spare. The ground has therefore to some extent been prepared in the State Department, if we now have to explain to them that we must ourselves continue to assist the Iranian xdir Force while asking the i-jnericans not to. Accusations which we should make every endeavour to forestall are not only that we are continuing to oblige the Shah while urging the United States Government to disappoint him, but no doubt also that while bringing pressure on United States Government not to let their exporters compete in a certain market we are encouraging our own to So so.BBfl — \ [CYPHER] % With the Compliments iVl of the -W* tJr\dcr Secretary of Stat« fo*‘ Foreign Affairs U . r !

Draft telegram explaining present position to the Government of India. 1941 928b 1000 2.2(32 ^ V/ MINUTE’ Baghdad telegram No.517 of June 5th (flagged) reported that the U.S. Minister had suggested that 9 Tomahawk aircraft,ordered by the Iranian Government from the Curtis Wright Corporation and said to be en route, should be diverted on some pretext into British hands. This telegram was repeated to the Government of India and a telegram No. 3222 of June 10th (flagged), which apparently comes from the Military authorities in India, asked that the U.S. Minister’s suggestion should be pursued in view of the desirability of preventing an ^ accession of strength to the Iranian Air Force. This telegram expressed reluctance to risk a collision with the Iranian Government and admitted that any form of sequestration might be unwelcome to the U.S. Government. It threw out the further suggestion that the latter should be induced to prohibit further shipments of aircraft to Iran. Baghdad telegram of June 5th said that the 9 Tomahawks were believed to have left New York on April 26th. From enquiries made by this Department of the London office of the Isthmian Line, however, it appeared probable that these aircraft are on a ship which left New York on May 23rd and is not due at Karachi until July 9th. After discussions two draft telegrams (flagged A and B) were drafted and hanued to the Foreign Office for their concurrence. It was explained to them that our desire that the possibility of diverting the 9 Tomahawks to India should be pursued arose not so much from anxiety to prevent the accession of strength to the Iranians, as from the consideration that these aircraft would be of great value to India’s dangerously weak air defences. The Foreign Office kept these drafts for some days, and it is understood that they were seen by Mr. Eden. In their reply they cty^jL dsuxyy very strongly against diverting the 9 Tomahawks, on whatever pretext; but they agree that a/veffort should be made to induce the U.S. Government to stop further consignments going to Iran. They have submitted for our concurrence a draft telegram to Washington. Shortly after we received the Foreign Office letter they sent us copies of Tehran telegram No.343 of June 17th, from which it appears that some Tomahawks, presumably the 9 in question, have reached Iran. In any case, however, it seems that we would have had to accept the F.O. view, which corresponds with that expressed in General Muspratt’s note of June 10th (flagged). Two letters from the Air Ministry to the Foreign Office, copies of which will be found below, take the same line. Two drafts are submitted: (a) a d.o.letter to the F.O. concurring in the draft telegram (subject to any alteration necessitated by the receipt of Tehran No.343) and asking that it should be repeated to the Government of India. (b) a telegram explaining the present position to the Government of India. Since the telegram from India of June 10th was marked ’’immediate” it seems as well to reply at once and not to await the despatch of the F.O. telegram. Although the question is now academic, it also seems best to explain to them briefly why it was felt here that the 9 Tomahawks should not be diverted.

Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs who had recer direct from London, information in first paragraph, is pleased at the hope of raw material in these difficult times and is anxious to re-start factory as soon as possible but asks for date of first delivery as that would strengthen his position with the Shah* 2* I have no doubt that if hope of Hurricanes was abandoned the Shah would be strongly tempted to turn to the Germans who would offer better terms than we ever did. The Shah might prefer the Americans as material develops but dollars are short and exceedingly difficult to release. At present there are twenty-five Rearwin training machines which have been in Tehran for four months and for lack of American exoerts are not yet unpacked. Tomahawks have reached Bandashahpur and one pilot and tv/o riggers to erect them have reached Tehran. 5, As to British aircraft personnel._Mr. Knight reports as follows. Personnel on production originally numbered eleven of whom tv/o left eighteen months ago and_ were not renlaced. The remaining nine reduced to two viz. Mr. Knight and one welder-fitter,, In addition there are four emnloyed on maintenance inspection, of whom two could probably be borrowed for production. India [sic] desires to absorb all six as their contracts expire, but most if not all would remain if material released. _ To make a beginning with construction of Hurricanes v/ith material described in your telegram under reference Mr. Knight in addition to welder fitter and the two men he could hope to borrow would need (A.)

I am sure that maintenance of factory is worthy of a struggle. Unfortunately the ask is more difficult now that the group have nearly all gone. The attraction of war work in India was too much for them once the hope of receiving Hurricane material disappeared. v-0 FOREIGN OFFICE. S.W.l (E 2998/112/34) 20th June, 1941 Dear Lumby, I return herewith the India Office draft telegram to the Government of India about the supply of United States aircraft (Tomahawks) to Iran.

The political ndoubtedly not be worth risking. t present and we propose, subject the departments concerned, to on as in the enclosed draft. '^e very much hope that you will agree that the question of diverting the nine Tomahawks may be dropped and that we should concentrate on ensuring that any further consignments of aircraft wnich Iran may have ordered in the United States are reserved for British use, wherever they are most needed.

As our forces in the Middle East and the Government of India need every machine available, I should be grateful if you would ask Mr. Purvis or Mr. Morris Wilson to express to United States autnorities our earnest hope that no export licences will be issued at present for any further consignments of aircraft for Iran. If Mr. Morris Wilson feels that he can justifiably ask for allocation to us of macnines ordered by or ready for shipment to Iran, he snould do so. 3.

It seems well therefore to send a reply to his paragraph 3 as soon as possible. If the situataon alters before the arrival of the snip*'at narachi we can always reopen the question with the F.G. Last evening . r. Covert-Price of the F.O. and Group- Captain Willetts of the Air i.inistry came to see me about this. The F.C. are anxious to do nothing to .ntagonise the Shah or to force nim into the arms of Germany. They are therefore inclined to favour the supply of United State.-: aircraft to Iran and to oppose both the C.G.S's. su_gestions, especially the first. The situation is co: plicated by the presence in Iran of a jtaff of aircraft mechanics, fro . the British firm of Hawkers, wno have been assembling material at the Iranian iircrait factory. The'F.C. do not want a situation to arise in which: we are supplying^ British aircraft material to Iran and at the same time preventing United States aircraft from goiti 0 there. The Air :-ini j try sympathise with India’s -r±sh to secure tne Tomahawks, but are not particularly anxious to get hold of them for their own use. While they have no detailed infer idtion about United States contracts for the supply of aircr .ft to Iran, they consider that these 9 Tomahawks/ * Cf(r &lt;7V *&gt;v Coimnawks are about the only modern machines which tne Iranians have been able to obtain ..roi-.

' r Yours sincerely,O' External Secretary . iu/ kJL I kA&lt;Mr % I h/tf/U' TUa{ a&gt;ul £ h&lt;AuuA. fn/rtl I understand that the first difficulty is that the Air Ministry do not wish to leave an opening in Iran for the supply to their Government of German aircraft ^*4* fiefore the war Iran bought British aircraft and Hawker’s have some organisation at Tehran for their assembly. We are, however, under the necessity of v/ithdrawing our personnel because they are wanted elsewhere and clearly we cannot supply aircraft ourselves. Consequently the Air Ministry welcomed the United States coming in to fill our place. There will also be the usual Foreign Office objections to doing anything v/hich might annoy the Shah. For these reasons there will, I think, be opposition from the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office ^ both^the unloading of the nine Tomahav/ks and to intervention with the United States to prevent further supplies/2 . supplies, I agree with General Muspratt that the unloading of the nine Tomahawks would be a very drastic action. It certainly could not be done for contraband reasons because the aircraft would be consigned to the Iranian Government and there is obviously no question of their going to the Germans. If the American exporters v/ere ready to order the unloading of the aircraft ^ at Karachi on their own responsibility as suggested by the United States Minister at Baghdad, this is a possible line but I doubt whether it is really feasible. I think, hov/ever, that we might ask the Foreign Office, Ministry of Economic Warfare and Air Ministry to agree to the United States Government being asked to adopt delaying tactics regarding further shipments. The Ministry of Economic Warfare could probably tell us the name of the ship on v/hich the nine Tomahawks are being carried. I think that she is the s.s. Washingtonian, due at Bombay on 16th June. ^F1LE copy [ ext 5219 Allotted to External Derarfaftjtf J ^ ^ ! SECi CET %r-X.
