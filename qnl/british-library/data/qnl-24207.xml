P. ANDERSON CHIEF L0C.1L REPRESENTATIVE ’ THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COI^PiiNY LIMITEDNo.PUR.212 November 7th, 1944. The Bahrein Petroleum Co.,Ltd., Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. PURCHASES FROM INDIA Dear Sirs, We would refer to your cable N0.78/P dated October 22nd informing us that the Petroleum Officer, India had advised the Petroleum Division, Baghdad in July last that all future Indents on India should be forwarded through the Political Agent in Bahrein to the External Affairs Department in the Government of India. New Delhi. This news came as a considerable surprise to us as we had received no advice regarding any change in the procedure which was duly laid down in our letter No.PUR-54 dated January 10th, 1944 and it was felt that had any change been suggested by the Government of India, they would have first approached us. The writer is well acquainted with all the officials in New Delhi who would be instrumental in instituting any change in the procedure and felt certain that he would have been advised before any instructions were forwarded to the Petroleum Division in Baghdad. We have just concluded a very thorough investigation in New Delhi and would advise that there is no change in the existing procedure whereby you submit your Indents for both six months requirements and emergency requirement*. The procedure outlined in our letter No.PUR-54 dated January 10th, 1944 is still in effect and has not been altered or changed. We have been in touch with the Petroleum Officer in New Delhi and he confirms that he is unaware of any change in the procedure and especially does not desire to disturb the arrangements detailed in our letter No.PUR-54 which have been and are working very smoothly. We have also contacted the Commerce Department and they also know of no change. They further desire that the current arrangements continue whereby your six monthly requirements will be submitted through the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo and your emergency requirements through the Office of the British Petroleum Representative in Baghdad. There appear to have been several changes in personnel in the External Affairs Department lately and apparently the new officers were not aware of the existing procedure. It may be due to this that the Office of the British Petroleum Representative in Baghdad received some intimation of a change in procedure, but after completing a very thorough investigation, we can assure you that it is not the desire of the Government of India to change in any way the procedure that has been in effect since our letter No.PUR-54 was written. It would appear as though this misunderstanding is directly responsible for the length of time it is taking us to obtain Export Licenses an your Requisitions NoSa TB-7577, TB-7628, TB-7394, TB-7634 and TB-7627. We are following this matter up and pressing for an immediate issue of Export Licenses, but as^our applications for these items had to be considered without the approval of the British Petroleum Representative in Baghdad, we are advised that a longer time is necessary to issue the licenses. We would greatly appreciate your taking the matter up with Baghdad and ascertaining where the change in instructions referred to in your cable No.P/78 emanated and we recommend that £ou revert to your former procedure of forwarding the six monthly requirements through the Middle East Supply Centre and the emergency requirements through Baghdad.

Dear Sirs, Rjii 3.UIREMSNT3 FRCIA cTaNUAKY TC 1945 We would refer to our letter No.PUR-220 of even date written you relative to the July/December 1944 requirements. We have just received your letter No.140-FUR dated November 9th submitting your requirements from January to June 1945 as well as correspondence between yourselves, the Petroleum. Division Representative, Baghdad, and the Political A^frtrTn Bahrein. As advised you in our letter No .FUR-212 d-afed November 7th, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no change in the method by which your six monthly requirements should be submitted to the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo and your emergency requirements through the Office of the British Petroleum Representative in Baghdad. The present view of the Commerce Department is that unless the requisitions come through these channels, considerable delay will result in issuing, export licenses as the Commerce Department will then submit your requisitions to these Authorities direct before passing any decision relative to issuing export licenses. In order to avoid serious delay in the issue of export licenses covering your Requisitions TB-7844, TB-7845, TB-7847, TB-7848, TB-7349, TB-7850* TB-7859, TB-7860, T3-7861, TB-7862 and TB-7863, we would strongly recommend that you immediately submit copies of these requisitions to the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo, so that they may forward them to the Government of India as quickly as possible. Cur understanding at present is that should you fail to do this, the Government of India will send copies of renuisitions that have been received by them direct from the Political Agent in Bahrein, to the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo for approval and return to India. This will take many months and result in serious delay in your obtaining the materials detailed on your requisitions. In order to avoid this delay, we suggest you send copies to the Middle East Supply Centre now and have your Representative in Cairo follow them up as suggested in cur letter No.PUR-220. We are most anxious to execute all your requisitions in the shortest time possible, but we are experiencing very great delays and difficulties at the present time due to the change in procedure which appears to have been implemented by you on instructions from the Office of the Petroleum Division Representati in their letter N0.399/38C. We have carefully investigated the matter in Delhi and can find no reason for this change in procedure insofar as the Government of India is concerned. In fact, the Government of India have definitely informed us that they do^not wish to deviate from their original procedure whereby your six- fc - monthly requirements should be submitted through the fiddle East Supply Centre and your emergency requirements through the Petroleum Division Representative in Baghdad. According to our information the fact that requisitions are submitted through the Political Agent in Bahrein to the External Affairs Department in New Delhi carries no weight insofar as allocation of supplies is concerned and therefore only necessitates the Authorities in India referring the requirements back to the proper supply authorities which are the Middle East Supply Centre and the Office of the British Petroleum Division Representative in Baghdad. In an endeavour to ascertain from where the instructions for this unfortunate change of procedure emanated, we are further pursuing our investigations in New Delhi to clarify the position for the future. 7!e will advise you further in this regard when our investigations have been completed.

Our telegwam No.765 Saving repeated New Delhi No.45 Saving Oil Company Requirements from India. We have now had en opportomity of dificuBsixig this question with Mr. Sinclair of who has just visited Caifro on his return fran talks with Departments of Commerce, New Delhi. 2. There appears to be a considerable overlap between oo^ called technical and non-technical requiremants ol Oil companies on India, for example between cotton piece goods for labourers, ^ #iich would be consider*! a non-technical requirement, and tontage and tarpaulins, which altl.ou^i counted by India as cotton goods* nave previously been considered a technical requirement oi tke Oil Companies. 3. In order to provide Oovemment of India with a consolidated forward programme for all oca tu on purposes the f oil owing sensmo ^ ^ has been drawn up which will we trust provide Proyemment of India with the information required* aud at the same time assist Companies to obtain their minimum essential requirements from India. (a) The distinction between technical and non- technical requirements will be dropped awl all requirements on Incia will oe handed in the same way. (b) The requirements of Oil Companies will be treated extra - territorially; that is to say they will not be included in the requirements of the territory wherein the Company is situated except for the retirements of native.labour. In such cases where it is considered preferable that requirements of native labour should be imported direct by the Oil Company concerned, e.g. textiles for distribution purposes, agreement Riiet be reached will, the territotial govamnent to the transfer of the requisite auantitiy from the territorial quota to the oil^ccroany progxamme. (c) A consolidated and agreed programme oi Oil company requirements detailing individual compinies will be forw&amp;rdf4 by by M.S.S.C. to Crovemment of India at the same time as normal iKfi.S.C. procurement programme for all M.^* territories. As M.K.S.O. programmeshave already been subnitted ior jhe mioie of 1944, requirements of Oil Companies for 2nd half I944^will be subnitted in .an additional programme to be forwarded to ^cvement. of India by beginning of Jims 1044. Oil Company reguiremanta for !he, whole of 1945 will be forwarded to Government of India with ether M.fi.S.O* territorial programme by December 1944. (d) Oil Companies will place orders against this programme as required. No territorial import licences need be demandsd by Government of India before export licences are gra* ted hit export licences so granted will be set against the Oil Prompany s proc.rturement programme as agreed oy Department of ^oraneree* New Delhi.

It is considered that the scheme det&amp;ilrd above would xx provide a stable basis for handling ell requirements of Oil Ccmpani*e on India and provide Government of India with a consolidated forward programme which can be used for purposes of end allocation of materials in short supply. 6. Would London ana Government of India please let us have their comments on this poipos&amp;l urgently so that we can advise Oil Oompnnies to submit programmes for 2nd half of 1944 to us thrimh Petroleum Division Representatives in ordsr tiiat we may pass them to Goverrinent of India before the beginning of JUne 1944. 7 # This procedure has been drawn upto provide the Government of India with a consolidate*' programmes of oil company requirements frem Didia.
