ANNUAL HBPOBTS We have the honour to inform you that we have been instructed by our London principals to notify H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikhs of Sharjah Dubai and Kalba that, owing to war conditions, there is nothing to report on the Company* s operations in their territories for the year ending December 1940.

Political Agency, No.C/TC-26. Bahrain, 18th February, 1950. Dear Stobart, Herewith an octract from a letter from Sir Rupert Hay to me. 2. These are statements made to Sir Rupert by Longrigg, the London Representative of I.P.C. The 'He' at (3) is Longrigg. ther Dubai has ever complained that the oil com pany have not drilled in his territory or whether we have any grounds in your opinion for suggest ing that they should? You will note, what I can only refer to as the remarkable nerve of the I.P.C. ^ in asking us to help them in what seems to be r- a purely commercial matter at the moment while they so often refuse to co-operate when their activities impinge on politics. 3. Could you kindly let me have a note on Abu Dhabi's alleged excursion into Customs ad ministration? 4. As regards (3), could you let me know whe- Yours sincerely Sgd. C.J. Pel? y. P.D. Stobart, Esq., Political Officer, Trucial Coast. Sharjah.3 8f5~- ys Extract from semi-official letter No. 225-0628 dated the 25th February, 1950, from Mr. P.D. Stobart, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah, to Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. 3. As regards (3), all the Shaikhs have, at one time or another, spoken to me about the fact that Petroleum Concessions Limited have not drilled in their territories, but I have not received any official or specific complaint from Dubai. I do believe that it would probably to everyones advantage if drilling were started there, but that is a vastly different thing from trying to get a letter from the Political Resident merely to use as a weapon at some future I.P.C Board meeting. I thoroughly agree with the views expressed in the last sentence of your letter under reference. (ORIGINAL ON FILE NO. 38/6)&lt; 3 &gt; 4 Confidential. No.C/R-146.
