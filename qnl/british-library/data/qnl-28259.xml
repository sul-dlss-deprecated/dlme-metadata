This increase is almost entirely attributable to increase in the value of exports to America, the only decrease being in the value of experts to Great Britain #iich has fallen from Rials 1,022 (£ 6,183) to Rials 169 (£ 1,127). Expert of carpets to America has increased from Rials 7,940 (£ 52,933) to Rials 26,775H£ 178,470) though difficulties of transhipment from Indian porta to America led to a decrease in exports towards the end of the ^ar under review. SMlffilt It is difficult to estimate how much of these increased imports into Iran have been absorbed and how much are in stock and being held by oerchants in the hope of appreciating values* It is however likely that with the decrease in shipping-space available from India that the imports for the year 1942-43 will show a decline as since February 1942 the import of sugar from India has ceased to be open to local merchants and wheat is, after the 1942 summer har vest, unlikely to be imported on behalf of the Iraafan Government* In tne same way the Indian Mills may find it difficult to maintain the export of piece-goods owing to shipping difficulties and the demands of the home market* *f t /. &amp;.

(All references to Rials are in ’000s.) 1. The trade figures in this report are, with the exception of those for the Kerman carpet industry, those for the port of Bandar Abbas. In the chang ed conditions, for which the war is mainly responsi ble, these figures do not give so complete a picture of the trade of this province as formerly. For example, cotton piece goods for this area were formerly imported via Bandar Abbas ; supplies received during the past trade year came overland, first from Germany and later from Russia. Many other items of commerce controlled by monopoly companies were distributed from their Tehran headquarters, having entered Iran at other ports or overland from Germany or Russia. Large quantities of carpets were sent from Kerman to Tehran and it is believed many found their way to Germany. Cargo space to and from Bandar Abbas was restricted, especially during the second half of the year. In these circumstances the figures for the year, though disclosing an appreciable drop, may be regarded as satisfactory. 2. Imports .—Although the National Bank's offic ial rate of exchange remained in the neighbourhood of Rials 70=£, it is understood that cent per cent, is added when converting foreign values for the purpose of levying customs duties. Thus a rate of Rials 140=£ is used for re conversion. Imports fell from Rials 26,356 (£188,250) in 1318 to Rials 11,767 (£84,050). The principal loser was Japan whose cotton piece goods trade (Rials 15,174 =£108,000 in 1318) was completely eliminated. Imports from the United Kingdom also fell from Rials 1,048 (£7,490) to Rials 308 (£2,200) while those from India slumped from Rials 2,816 (£20,120) to Rials 1,918 (£13,700). The appreciable fall in imports of Indian tea by this route (from Rials 2,385=£ 17,000 to Rials 935=£6,680) was no doubt due to limited cargo space and high sea freights. It will probably be found that imports by the land route were correspondingly increased. Detailed imports will be found in Appendix A. 3. Exports .—In thts case a “ black rate ” of Rials 180=£ is used for arriving at sterling values as this was the approximate rate sellers of sterling received with which to make purchases. Exports declined from Rials 34,075 (£189,307) to Rials 23,308 (£129,500) but in the circumstances this is not excessive. Germany’s sea borne trade was of course completely wiped out and other reduc tions occurred in exports of wool and goat hair to United Kingdom and America. But against this must be set exports of wool and goat hair which, barred from the normal sea route, have found their way to Germany via Russia. For detailed exports see Appendix B. 4. Carpet Industry .—Despite w^ar conditions and the closing of the London market, the carpet indus try has enjoyed a satisfactory year. Shipments to America were considerably increased and losses in other directions were more than met by consign ments to Tehran and from thence to Germany and elsewhere by the overland route. In 1318 carpets to the value of Rials 15,354 (£85,300) were despatched from Kerman to America and United Kingdom. During 1319 carpets despatched from Kerman to America were valued at Rials 12,721 (£70,670) and those to Tehran at Rials 4,704 (£26,000) a total of Rials 17,425 (£96,670). By the end of the year the market was falling and few new orders were being placed on the looms. G. A. FALCONER, Major, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, Bandar Abbas.

The official exchange rate of the National Bank remained in the neighbourhood of rials 80=£ up to the end of 1939. On the 1st January the British Treasury rate was raised to rials 160=£ (later to about 186=£). The Iranian Government there upon decided to link the rial with the dollar and on the basis of the pre-war sterling—doller rate the National Bank rate is now quoted at about rials 60=£. It is a purely fictitious value, for no one can obtain foreign exchange for trade or other pur poses at less than rials 180=£. Even at this rate the supply docs not meet the demand. The present financial structure of this country must cause many headaches. III.—Foreign Trade. (a) Imports .—It is assumed that for official statis tics the Customs Department has converted foreign values at the official rate of exchange, and as for the greater part of the year the equivalent was rials 80=£, this rate is used for re-conversion in the case of imports. The total imports by this route are up by nearly 50 per cent. The most noticeable features are (a) the 500 per cent increase in imports from Japan ; (/;) 400 per cent decrease in German imports ; and (c) elimi nation of imports from U.S.S.R. 1316. 1317. 1318. 19 494 18,158 26,356 (£243,675) (£226,980) (£329,461) In addition the Atlas Company of Denmark and Tehran have imported machinery and other mate rials for the Fish Canning Factory at Bandar Abbas to the value of rials 2,400,000 (£30,000). The goods .are entered in a separate Customs account and in any case are not subject to Customs duty. Imports from the United Kingdom show an in crease of 50 per cent, but this is more than accounted for by copper and metal sheets which probably originated in Belgium and were shipped via a British port. Imports from India fell by 25 per cent. The principal falls occurred in cotton piecegoods and A detailed statement of imports, values and coun tries of origin will be found in Appendix A. (b) Exports.—In the case of exports Customs statistics are concerned only with the rial value o the goods. But as a £ will purchase approximately 180 rials worth of Iranian products, this rate of conversion is used to appreciate the value of Iranian exports in terms of sterling. On this basis there is an increase of nearly 22 per cent in the total exports over the preceding year :— United Kingdom . India . 1317. 1318. 27.997 34,075 (£155*539) (£189,307) 6,994 9,164 (£38,858) (£50,913) 1,607 2,535 (£8,930) (£14,088) Noticeable variations from the preceding year are the increases in exports to the United Kingdom and India and the 80 per cent increase in exports to Germany. The change in the case of the United Kingdom is chiefly accounted for by the increase export of wool, diverted from the former German market. Although the total exports show an appreciable increase the value of carpets exported fell by nearly 50 per cent. This fall is largely due to the outbreak of the European war which considerably reduced shipments to the United States of America. Details of exports, values and countries of con sumption will be found in Appendix B. IV.—Shipping. Ocean-going vessels with an aggregate of 221,447 tons (excluding the British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly mail service) entered and cleared at the port of Bandar Abbas during 1939.

The cost of living was high, and restrictions on foreign exclange purchases continued to hamper trade.

The decrease in imports seemed to be due rather to lack of foreign exchange than to increased Iranian self-sufficiency, while the increase in exports was accounted for almost entirely by the greater value of carpets exported. Imports from the United Kingdom and India,.! showed a slight increase in value^probably due to ’ the marked decline in imports from Germany, as V Iran/ -Iran fell Into arrears with shipments to that country under their barter agreement, and her purchasing credit was reduced accordingly.

I. Introduction. The trade statistics given in this report are those for the port of Bandar Abbas, which, for practical purposes represent the volume of trade for the province of Kerman and the district of Bandar Abbas. The new Ustandar (Governor-General) for the 8th (Kerman) Ustan arrived in Kerman at the end of February and hopes are entertained that he will do something to improve the general and trading conditions in this province. It is understood that he is preparing a 3-year development scheme. II. Finance. The restriction on foreign exchange continues to hamper trade. During the year the official rate of exchange averaged rials 80 per £ sterling and rials 600 per Rs. 100, but there is no limit to un official buyers at double these rates. Dealings at the “ black-bourse ” rate of 160 rials to the £ become more and more open and reports are cur rent of transactions in high places. A rate of 160 rials to the £ more accurately represents the inter nal value of the rial today. All banking business in this area is in the hands of the National Bank of Iran (Bank-i Melli). Dur ing the past year a new branch has been opened at Minab, though the trade at this place does not warrant the additional facilities. III. Foreign Trade. (a) Imports —(rials quoted in 1,000 s ; conver sion 80—£) :— 1315. 1316. 1317.) 26,300 (£328,750) 19,494 (£243,675) 18,158 (£226,980) These figures reveal a steady decline in imports and the contributory causes may be (a) the lack of exchange for foreign purchases, or (6) Iran has become more self-supporting. It is most probable that (a) is the principal factor in the decline. Primd facie (b), in view of the strides which have been made in the internal manufacture of, for example, textiles, should have its’ effect on im ports. The figures, however, do not support such a view for in 1317 cotton piece goods to the value of rials 4,464 (£55,800) were imported via Bandar Abbas, an increase of rials 1,540 (£19,255) over the previous year. Another cause may be that Iran is behind with her shipments to Germany under the barter agree ment and her purchasing credit was reduced accordingly. For it is noteworthy that at rials 1,983 (£24,793) imports from Germany by the Bandar Abbas route during 1317 are no less than rials 3,105 (£38,824) lower than in the preceding year. Imports from the United Kingdom and India show a slight increase,— 1316. 1317. United Kingdom . 404 (£5,050) 645 (£8,067) India . . . 3,094 (£38,675) 3,256 (£40,704) In view of the general dechne in imports the figures for the United Kingdom and India, which together represent more than 20 % of the whole , may be regarded as satisfactory. A detailed statement of imports, values and countries of origin will be found in Appendix A. (b) Exports — 1315. 1316. 1317. 17,623 (£220,287) 23,348 (£291,650) 27,997 (£349,963) These figures show a steady increase in exports and if compared with the import figures for the same port they suggest an appreciable balance of trade in favour of Iran. The factors contri buting to the decline in exports are, however, referred to above. The statistics indicate that the increase in exports from this area is dependent upon the condition of the Kerman and district carpet industry which has supplied more than 50 % of the total exports during the last three years, viz :— 1315. 1316. 1317. Carpets 9,944 13,094 16,695 At face value these figures belie the gloomy reports of merchants that the carpet industry is worsening yearly. Yet there is considerable unemployment among weavers and it may be2 n r true that a large proportion of shipments during the past 12—18 months were from stocks on hand.. The carpet figures also illustrate the import ance of the industry to foreign trade generally in this area, for the carpet exports for 1317 ap proximate the total value of imports for the same period. This suggests that merchants can depend only upon the exchange available from carpet exports with which to purchase foreign goods and that the Central Government contributes nothing from its resources towards the furtherance of foreign trade in these parts. More than 25% of the carpets exported from Bandar Abbas were shipped to the United King dom (for the European market) which country also absorbed more than 60% of the red oxide shipped from the island of Hormuz. Details of exports, values and countries of consumption will be found in Appendix B. IV. Agriculture. The year’s grain crops were satisfactory and there was no shortage of bread as occurred the previous year. More land was put under wheat and barley at the expense of cotton. This was doubly fortunate for all cotton crops in this area were destroyed by order owing to the alleged appearance of ‘ red worm ’. Poppy cultivation has been drastically cur tailed. The winter and spring rains have been excel lent and there should be good crops in the ensuing year. The local agricultural department has been done away with and agricultural development is now in the hands of the Ustandar and his agricultural adviser. Agriculture is to play a prominent part in the Ustandar’s 3-year development scheme. The Ustandar recognises that the first and urgent problem to be tackled is the conservation and pro per distribution of the water supply, but he is hampered by the lack of expert advisers in such matters. V. Industry. Some attempt has been made at exploitation of the copper deposits at Bahr Asman, 69 miles South-East of Kerman but the results are not known. The foundations of a fish canning factory were laid at Bandar Abbas in February last. This industry, which is to include a second factory at Bushire, is financed by the Iranian Govern ment and the Atlas Company of Copenhagen. The Khorshid Spinning Mill, Kerman was closed ^ for some weeks owing to managerial troubles. The mill is again working but not to capacity owing to shortage of raw material. The Khunji Spinning Mill at Bandar Abbas is also experiencing difficulties due to shortage of raw cotton. VI. Communications. No new main roads were constructed during the year. Work is in progress to link up surround ing villages with Kerman by motorable roads— at the expense of the landowners concerned. During the past year there have been a few isolated cases of attacks on caravans in this area, but these have occurred off” the principal trade routes. There is no reported case of an attack on wheel transport which is the principal form of conveyance for merchandise. On the whole internal security has been well maintained. VII. Economic. The cost of living remains at a high level. The official value of the rial is 'id. ; its purchasing value is about \\d. With ever increasing taxation, exactions legal and otherwise, compulsory ex penditure and donations in connection with the wedding celebrations, against all of which there is no effective appeal, the lot of the inhabitants is not enviable. VIII. Shipping. A total of 136 ocean-going vessels with an ag gregate of 503,455 tons (gross) entered and cleared the port of Bandar Abbas during the year 1938. These figures include the British India Steam Navigation Co.’s weekly mail service. Of late much of the cargo for Europe and America formerly carried in British India steamers is now being shipped by the Hansa Line at lower freight rates. G. A.

There was very little change in the situation during the year, which 'terminated on a note of depression so far as foreign merchants were concerned'. Imports decreased by Rials 6,806,133 (£85,076), but there was a rise of Rials 5,725,577 (£71,569) , / Of the principal foreign competitors in the • Kerman market all, with the exception of Japan aid. Russia, lost some ground. Germany, however, still has the lion’s share of the import trade, and, while her barter agreement with Persia is in operation, is likely to continue to do so at the expense of the U.K. and India, although the latter did not do too badly, being second to .a Germany with imports amounting to Rs.5,15,674.

I. Introduction. The area covered by this report is the Province of Kerman and the District of Bandar Abbas. It is bounded by Iranian Baluchistan and the Dasht-i-Lut on the West, Yezd on the North, Ears and Laristan on the East and the Persian Gulf on the South, an area of approximately 170,540 square miles. The total population of this area is estimated at 400,000. The province of Kerman has 29 sub-divisions of which the more important are,— Kerman. —(5,600 ft.); headquarters of the provincial governorate ; population 56,300 ; 350 miles north of the port of Bandar Abbas, and 368 miles east of Zahidan. The commercial output is mainly carpets. Sirjan. —(2,758 ft.); 120 miles south of Kerman on the Bandar Abbas route ; population 18,000, agricultural produce and a distributing centre. Rafsinjan. —(5,241 ft.) ; 66 miles north-west of Kerman ; population 31,000 ; is chiefly noted for production of cotton, pistachio and almonds. Bam—(2,346 ft-); l 20 south-east of Kerman ; population 26,000 ; henna and gum tragacanth are produced in this district. Shahdad (Khabis).—(l,S00 ft.), population 12,000 , 57 miles west of Kerman, produces fruit for the Kerman market. Bandar Abbas. —Population 35—40,000 ; head quarters of the district. It is the port for Kerman and the adjacent territories. *- Internal security has been well maintained during the past year and there has been little inteference with either wheel or pack transport in this area. The military garrison at Bandar Abbas has been reduced from a regiment to three companies M28EAD of infantry and brought within the Kerman brigade. II. Finance. The foreign exchange control, the slump in imports, and a poor harvest were the principal features of the financial situation during the past year. A good deal of the capital formerly utilised in foreign trade is now put into monopoly companies, for want of something better, which on the whole give a good return to investors. The cost of living is now nearly double that of a year ago, resulting in the internal devaluation of the rial. The official selling rates during the past year averaged rials 82’40 per £ and rials 603-45 per 100 rupees, but in the bazaar it is possible to obtain 120 and 10—1200 rials respec tively. Banking facilities in this area are now in the hands of the National Bank of Iran. New branches were opened at Sirjan and Bam and further branches are contemplated at the cqbtal towns of Lingah, Charbar and Jask. Currency is confined to notes, copper and nickel coins ; there are no silver coins in circulation. Financial conditions viewed through the volume of foreign trade via Bandar Abbas showed little variation from the previous year, though the general impression was that money was tight and the year terminated on a note of depression so far as the foreign merchants were concerned. ITT Foreign Trade. The principal route for foreign trade with this area is via Bandar Abbas. The figures for imports and exports via Bandar Abbas are given in the appendices. (a) Import*.—The total for the past year is valued at rials 19,494,191 (£243,677) a decrease of rials 6,806,133 (£85,076) from the previous year. B2 f -—-— ■ — 41 The principal importing countries are :— Germany. —£63,617 ; dyes, chemicals, woollen pieeegoods, metals, machinery, electri cal equipment, bicycles and general stores. India. —£38.673 or Rs. 5,15,674 ; cotton piece- goods, tea and spices. £28,518 ; sugar. Japan. —£16,862 cotton piecegoods, tea. Belgium. —£15,406 ; sheet metal, sugar. Imports from the United Kingdom amounted to £5,060. Details of imports by commodities are given in Appendix B (1). Details of imports by countries for the first half of the year are given in Appendix D (1). So long as the present restrictions on foreign exchange continue and the barter agreement between Iran and Germany remains in force, there appears to be little prospect of an increase in the imports from either India or the United Kingdom. (6) Exports. —The total for the year via Bandar Abbas is valued at rials 23,348,766 (£291,860) an increase of ra$s 5,725,577 (£71,569), vide Appendix A ; details by commodities are given in Appendix B (2). It will be seen that more than 50 per cent, of the exports by this route are carpets for which the United States of America and the United Kingdom (for the European market) are the buyers. The other principal exports are wool and goat hair (Germany and Japan), red oxide (United Kingdom, United States of America and Germany) pistachios (United States of America and India), and dried fruits (Germany and India). Details of exports by countries for the first half of the year are given in Appendix D (2). IV. Agriculture. There are indications that a greater interest is being taken in agricultural development. A more experienced officer has been appointed provincial director and it is understood that he has obtained a substantial grant from the Central Government for clearing and repairing the under ground canals in this area which were damaged by the floods of 1932. The grant is for the new year (1317) and it remains to be seen if it is used to good effect. Most of the crops in this area depend upon the rainfall. Last season’s rains were much below normal, resulting in very poor crops. By Novem ber the scarcity of wheat and other domestic cereals became serious and the situation was only saved by importing into the province supplies of wheat from Isfahan, Hamadan and Kerman- shah. The principal crops in this district are cereals, cotton, pistachios, almonds and opium. Under government pressure more land was put under cotton last season to meet the demands of the monopolies and mills. This policy contri buted largely to the food shortage referred to above. It would appear from current sowings that the lesson has been partially learnt. This season’s rain has so far been excellent through out the district and there are prospects of a good harvest. Mons. Wetli, a Swiss subject, with two Zoras- trian merchants of Kerman, acquired a large area of land near Haji Abad and Gahkum on the Sirjan-Bandar Abbas road, for agricultural development. The price paid is believed to be about rials 150,000. A company was formed to improve the water supply near Bandar Abbas by means of artesian wells, but operations are suspended owing to difficulty and delay due to import and exchange restrictions, in obtaining replacements for damaged parts. V. Industry. The principal industry in the Kerman district is carpet weaving. Notwithstanding the com plaints of merchants.about the weakness of over seas markets, especjllty America, and the diffi culties created by the exchange restrictions, the following comparative statement shows that there is little variation^ in the disposal figures during the past four years :— (In thousands of rials). 1313. 1314. 1315. 1316 (1937-38). Kermanis . 11,671 9,505 9,704 9,200 Tribal 940 51 245 200 Total 12,511 9,596 9,949 9,400 4*&gt;3 It remains to be seen to what extent the industry is affected by the further exchange restrictions introduced at the end of the year, by which 50 per cent, of the exchange resulting from exports must be sold to the government at a fixed rate of 80 rials to the £ and the balance utilised for imports. Early in the year the Khurshid Spinning Mill was opened in Kerman with a capital of rials 350,000. The mill employs about 500 hands and has a weekly output of about 18-20,000 lbs. of thread. Khunjis’ Spinning Mill at Bandar Abbas employs about 300 hands in day and night shifts. There is an English Spinning Master employed at this Mill and the output is about 24,000 lbs. per week. The labour employed is mostly women and children and from observation about 50 per cent, are under 16 years of age. The scale of wages is extremely low; machine-tenders 1-2 rials per shift, overseers 90—150 rials per month. During the year ginning factories were opened at Kerman, Zarand, Biaz, and Sirjan, and elec tricity plants installed at Rafsinjan and Sirjan. A soap factory was opened recently in Kerman, and it is understood that a canning factory will shortly be erected at Bandar A1 has in connec tion with the Iran fishing induslry. VI. Transport. The three principal motor roads from Kerman are (1) to Bandar Abbas, via Sirjan (120), 350 miles ; (2) to Tehran, via Yezd (234) and Isfahan (434), 714 miles ; and (3) to Zahidan via Bam (120), 368 miles. These roads are kept in rea sonable repair and motor vehicles have ousted animal transport over long distances. Practically the whole of the foreign trade with this area is carried over the Bandar Abbas road. Heavy commercial lorries can do the journey between Bandar Abbas and Kerman in 2—3 days. No new roads were constructed during the past year. No attacks on motor transport were recorded during the year, but there were a few raids on M28EAD caravans in the more isolated regions. On the whole security on the trade routes was well maintained. There is no appreciable change in transport rates. VII. State Undertakings and Public Utilities. Monopoly companies are the nearest approach to state undertakings in this area. There are now about a dozen such companies of any import ance. A new company under the name of “ Sherkati Panbah, Pust va Pashm ’ was estab lished during the year, with a capital of rials 600,000. The products of these companies are inferior to the foreign goods whose place they are intend ed to take, though just as expensive, but in the absence of competition the companies are doing good business. The only public utilities are electricity and water supply. These are frequently in the hands of individuals rather than companies. The Central Government has now taken over the working of the red oxide mines at Hormuz and the salt mines at Qishm and Namakdan. These mines were formerly in the charge of the Governor of Bandar Abbas. VIE. Social. The cost of living continued to rise and for essential foodstuffs the rial is now worth about half as much as a year ago. Wages have not increased proportionately and consequently most of the inhabitants are feeling the adverse balance. The introduction of westernization with its tendency to raise the standard of living, is not compatible with the present financial condi tion of the people. The functions of the local municipalities appear to be mainly confined to the construction of wide thoroughfares in the towns, a laudable enter prise at the expense of property owners. Sanita tion has not so far been brought within the scope of westernization; sun and rain are still relied upon to cleanse the streets and alleyways. In towns where it exists municipalities are extravagant consumers of electricity. In the case of Kerman, however, the municipal debt to the owner of the power station for current c' supplied now amounts to rials 1,15,000. The Kerman municipal revenue for the past year amounted to rials 4,80,010. The Kerman club is still in existence though now more as a “ hotel ” than a social centre. Kerman ; The 30th March 1938. Most of the films shown at the local cinema are of German origin. The apparatus is not good, but the entertainment is fairly well patronised. G. A.

ENCLOSUHE m Utter ’•* - - **■ 5 12Annual Report Economic (A) of Kerman and Bandar Abbas Areas for the Iranian Year 1315 (21st March 1936 to 20th March 1937) Introduction. This report covers the area extending from the Khorasan frontier a,nd the desert of Dasht-i-Lut in the north, to the Persian Gulf in the south. To the east' Ls adjacent to British Baluchistan, while the province of Fars constitutes its western boun dary . ii- The province of Kerman and Iranian Baluchistan is about as large as France. Kerman, with an estimated population of about 85,000, is the seat of the Governor-General. The province of Kerman is situated on a plateau and is sub-divided into 29 balukats (sub-divisions) of which the following are important from a commer cial point of view :— £j r j rt?l .__There is possibly a prosperous future for this town as it is here that the Kerman, Shiraz, Lar and Yezd trade routes bifur cate. With the improvement of the Shiraz and Lar motor roads, Sir]an is almost sure to become a big distribution centre. Raf.nnjan .—Is the centre for cotton, pistachio and almonds. The annual output of these is about 3,000.000 lbs. Shahdad (Khabis).—Ie situated on the eastern edge of the Lut desert. Its orange and date groves supply the Kerman market. Rani '—Is famous for its production of Henna. The cultivation is actually carried on in the Naramshir district which is adjacent to the east, but Bam reaps the benefit. Katira (Gum Tragacanth) grows in pro fusion in the surrounding hills of Bam, but unfortunately in this district little or no commercial use is made of this product. Henna is exported in bulk to Yezd where it is ground and then exported. It is believed that the Government is now busy in the development of both of these industries in this area. Bandar Abbas.—1$ the port for Kerman. Its commercial importance lies in its being the trade route for the markets of South East Iran, namely, Kerman, Yezd and Isfahan, and from which the produce of these districts are exported. The only in dustry in the town is cotton spinning. The products of commercial importance in the neighbourhood are Dates and Henna. The former are grown in the district of Minab, while the latter, come from the Shamilad region which lies to the north east of Bandar Abbas. There are salt mines at Hormuz Island and at Namakdan (Kishm) and commercial use is now being made of it by Monopoly Companies and Firms. The minor ports of Jask and Charbar are merely fishing centres. It is expected that when the Zahidan-Charbar road is com pleted, Charbar will become the port for Khorasan, Sistan and Mekran. Finance. Owing to the transitory revival of the carpet industry in the province of Kerman during last autumn and the early part of last winter, when the money market was not as tight as before, monetary transactions showed signs of improvement. Towards the end of the year, however, the money market \ resumed its usual tightness, which may be attri buted to the restriction of credit, agricultural de pression, ever-changing high taxation, slump in general trade, and finally to the foreign exchange control. As the year progressed, all articles of food, especially bread, went up in price on account of wheat having been monopolised by the Govern ment. As a result of this, shop-keepers were com- I pelled to borrow money against mortgage, and in certain cases this state of affairs resulted in bankruptcy. There is a tendency on the part of the merchants to invest part of their capitals in the newly formed Monopoly Companies. The official selling rates during the year averaged as follows :— Rials 600 per 100 Rupees, Rials 80 per pound sterling. The National Bank of Iran in Kerman captured the bulk of the local banking business. As a result of this, and of the local difficulties and restrictions arising from the exchange control, the Kerman branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran closed down in September last. The National Bank of Iran intend to open branches at Bam and Sirjan in the year 1316. Foreign Trade. Of the three appendices attached to this report Appendix “A” shows the total imports and exports w&lt;3 Bandar Abbas, during the year under review,together with the figures of the previous year. App endix “B” supplies details of imports and exports for various commodities. Appendix “ C ” is a com parative statement of imports from the British Empire and other sources. It will be seen from these that foreign trade has been hard hit, with the exception of the increased importation of tea, loaf sugar, pepper, cotton piece- goods and machinery. The following two policies of the State are great ly responsible for the elemination of foreign interests in trade with Iran, viz .— (1) The formation of Monopoly Companies. Some 21 such companies have been formed in this area. Their capital is subscribed partly by the general public in the form of shares and partly by the Government through the agency of either the National Bank of Iran or the Agricultural Bank. The affairs of such Companies are controlled by the Government. These Companies are now endeavouring to es tablish their own buying and selling agencies abroad which will further minimise the chances of free trade. (2) The promulgation of the foreign Exchange Control Act where^by all transactions in foreign exchange must be carried out with the previous assent of and under the auspices of a Control Com mission at the Capital, has further aggravated the position. The following is the irksome procedure which a trader must adopt before importing goods:— An import licence must be obtained from the Department of Commerce, which can only be issued with the sanction of the Exchange Control Commis sion at Tehran. On receipt of this licence the trader then prepares his order for goods, giving full particulars in a special form known as “Appli cation for exchange for imports” which is forward ed to the Exchange Commission, Tehran. When permission is obtained, one of the two authorised Banks issues a letter of credit for the sanctioned amount of foreign exchange, provided the importer (a) pays the premium of 25% of the sanctioned amount in Rials and (6) produces the copy of the order for goods showing the particulars of consign ments and place of origin. The Bank then examines the import licence in the possession of the importer to ascertain that it covers the goods and prices as invoiced, and it is after these preliminaries are completed that the trader is in a position to order the goods. He then sends the letter of credit to the consignor who hands over the shipping documents regarding the goods, together with the credit note to the Bank abroad. This Bank, in its turn, ad justs matters with the Bank in Iran which issued the letter of credit. The transactions of the import permit premia were mostly conducted by the National Bank of Iran at Kerman and Bandar Abbas and these institutions retained a net profit of per cent, between their buying and selling rates, for themselves. Practically all exports from Kerman p rovinco during the year were forwarded via Bandar Abbas, hence the Kerman-Zahidan route lost its impor tance as a route for export. Germany enjoys a privileged position by the terms of her recently concluded Treaty known as / the “Irano German Tautteur Agreement” ha^^ht on the barter system. Germany has captured aboui, 70% of the synthetic dye trade and has to some extent ousted the Japanese and the Russians from ^; the Iranian markets. This Agreement is also likely !- to prove a source of danger to British interests in l this province. Appendix “C” shows a noticeable decline in the j imports of British commodities, due to the demand ; for German, Russian, and cheap Japanese goods. * Of Russian goods, a few consignments of petrol, kerosene oil, grease and lubricating oil and piece- goods were imported from Tehran by the local petty traders. The Soviet trade of cotton piece- goods has received a severe setback due to the market being flooded with Japanese goods of the same kind but of cheaper price. Credit facilities offeried by foreign firms are un likely to produce a healthy influence owing to the present stagnant condition of foreign trade. The Japanese are often found willing to afford credit facilities by taking one-third in cash and two-thirds in Iranian products, but it appears that no local merchant ever cares to take advantage of such facilities. Local credit facilities might have the desired effect, but so deteriorated is the Local com mercial morality that even the Bank is over cau tious in affording such facilities to reputed firms. So, as matters stand at present it is doubtful whether it would pay any British firm to establish a repre sentative in this province. In view of the dilatory methods employed in the local judicial courts, commercial suits are pre ferably settled by the Arbitrary Board under the auspices of the local Chamber of Commerce, which under the new Governor-General is working more satisfactorily. Agriculture. Efforts are being made to improve agricultural conditions and the area under cultivation in Kerman is gradually increasing. It is, however, feared that the present area, which is estimated to be some 200,000 acres, will not reach its normal produc tion for some years yet, as the damage done to many of the under-ground channels (qanats) during the floods of 1932 has not yet been fully repaired and some of these are considered to be totally damaged. An official of the Central Irrigation Monopoly Company visited Kerman during the year and stayed for a few months during which period he excavated several under-ground chan nels as an experimental measure, but met with no success. He was recalled to the Capital in3 February last. The methods of agriculture and fer tilization of soil are still primitive. On account of the scarcity of rain upon which the agriculture of the province mainly depends the year under report may be considered a year of agricultural depression. Had it not been for the boom in the carpet industry and trade there would n ^» been famine. The wheat crop was not bad, yet the prices were higher than in the previous year. At the present time there is a scarcity of wheat and bazaar bread is made from a mixture of wheat and barley flour, and even this is diffi cult to procure; Livestock in the country has greatly reduced. The chief agricultural products of the province are cereals, also cotton, pistachios, almonds and opium. More attention is now being paid to promote the cultivation of pistachio trees in the Kerman and Rafsinjan areas, and of Henna and Indigo in the Bam and Narmashir districts. With a view to meeting the requirements of the newly established spinning factory (Khorshid Spinning Mill at » Kerman) cotton is now being grown on extensive areas of land in the vicinity of Rafsinjan and Bias, instead of opium. No new crops were introduced during the year except beetroot and spices, which are being cul tivated as an experiment in the Jeeruft area. The prices of articles of foodstuff are fixed by the local Baladiyeh but in most cases, these are seldom adhered to by the shop-keepers. Industry. The chief industry of the Kerman province is carpet weaving. The total amount of exports in Kerman carpets and tribal rugs during the year was Rials 9,949,000 (£124,362) as compared with Rials 9,596,000 (£119,950) in the previous year. As this industry employed nearly three-fourths of the inhabitants of the province, its slump in the early part of the year adversely affected all classes. On the formation of the Carpet Monopoly Company at Kerman in the middle of the year, there was a certain amount of excitement amongst the local representatives of the European and American firms, which immediately placed comparatively large orders with the Weavers for carpets so that these would be ready for shipment out of the coun try before the 20th March 1937, this being the date on which the Monopoly Carpet Company would begin to function. It was said that after the above date all carpet trade woidd be carried on through the agency of the above Company and that all trade by private traders would be discontinued but it remains to be seen how far this scheme will mature specially since the death of the Minister of Finance. The machinery for the Khorshid Spinning Mill of Kerman has arrived from Germany and it is hoped that the factory’ will begin to function in the early part of 1316. Three German Engineers have been employed by the company to instal the machi-* nery. The projects for promoting the indigo inr dustry at Bam; and of founding a hat factory at Kerman have not yet materialized. The output of Mr. Khunji’s Cording and Spin-t ning Mill at Bandar Abbas is about 3,600 lbs. of yarn and twist per day. At Kerman, the Harandi electric plant is wor king satisfactorily, At Bandar Abbas the Go vernor has not yet succeeded in forming a Company for the importation of a new electric plant. The old system of quarrying the red oxide mines at Hormuz is still adhered to. The Sherkat Namak has met with success in its task of working the salt mines at Namakdan (Kishm). In the province of Kerman, the working of Coal mines in the Badamu hills, and that of Marble Mines at Rayin have virtually ceased. The rearing of silk worms in Kerman is gradu ally improving, and more mulberry trees are being planted for the purpose. At present there appears to be no prospect for i immediate demand for foreign machinery. Transport. Kerman is connected by motor road with (1) Yezd, Isfahan and Tehran, (2) Sirjan-Bandar Abbas. This route is gradually gaining popu larity over the Zahidan route on account of. the Indian Customs House at Nok Kundi, (3) Bam- Zahidan. The Sirjan Shiraz route via Niriz is seldom used on account of insecurity, scarcity of water, petrol and other necessaries of life. The mail service between Kerman and up-country trade centres was well maintained during the year. Towards the close of the year the bi-weekly mail J service between Kerman and Bandar Abbas was very irregular owing to friction between the Pos tal department and the Contractor. The Kerman- Jeeruft, and Karman-Shahdad roads have not yet been improved. The old motor roads have beem well kept and perfect security prevailed. Animal transport is used only between the places where no motor roads exist, otherwise motor lorries are the principal means of transport. The transport rates fluctuate according to the seasons of the year. The transport rates between Kerman and the prin cipal Iranian towns were the same as those quoted in last year’s report. State Undertakings. The Government has aimed at official control of trade and other undertakings, and to achieve this end Companies have been, and are still being formed throughout the country. To these Com panies, the Sole Monopoly is granted of dealing in specific undertakings of the Government. As a4 result of this policy, some 21 Companies have been formed in this area. Of these, the following ten Companies are worthy of note (The capital of these Companies, as noted against each, is partly subscribed by the general public and parti} by the Government through the National Bank of Iran and Agricultural Bank) :— Rials. 1. Sherkat Khorshid Spinning Mill . 3,000,000 2. Sherkat Pashminah (Woollen textile) 3,000,000 3. Woollen Carding Company . . 1,000,000 4. Kerman Pieeegoods Company . 1,000,000 5. Kerman Tea and Loaf sugar Com pany ..... 1,050,000 6. Kerman Dry Fruit Company . 2,000,000 7. Sherkat Kala .... 300,000 8. Sherkat Kateera (Gum Tragacanth) . 1,070,000 9. Kerman Motor Transport Company. 300,000 0. Sherkat Noushabeh . . . 60,000 The Government has already considered making Charbar the entrepot of Khorasan-Sistan and Mekran and a motor road is being made between Zahidan and Charbar. Other contemplated schemes are :— 1. Construction of a big dam on the river Nissa in the Bam-Narmashir area. 2. Exploiting the Coal Mine of Badamu and the Marble Mine of Rayin. 3. Revival of the Indigo industry at Bam and Narmashir. 4. Construction of a Sugar Factory at Jeeruft. 5. Connecting Khorasan with Kerman by road via Jeeruft. 6. Connecting Kerman with the fertile area of Shahdad. It remains to be seen when these elaborate under takings will mature. Public Utility. In this country where embargoes on foreign trade are so easily placed, and the ever-changing regulations regarding the counterbalancing of ex ports with imports, it is difficult to write about public demands or utilities. The policy of the Government in placing an embargo on foreign twists and yarns is to promote and encourage the products of the Iranian Spinning Mills in the country. The articles which constitute the main items of public utility are :— cotton piece-goods, glass-ware, crockery, tea ma chinery and perfumes, but owing to the Foreign Exchange Control, al most prohibitive Customs duties, heavy road tax and import permit premium, etc., their importa tion is rapidly becoming limited. Social. The general cost of living has steadily risen. There is an increase in the cost of most imported commodities due to the monopolization of foreign trade, exchange control, shortage of foreign curren cies, and new Customs tariffs. The disappearance of the Chaddur and the oHh gation to were European dress has added siderably to the cost of living and created hard ships among the poorer classes. It may be hoped that the cost of living will go dowm as the agricul tural development of the country advances. Owing to the employment of a large number of weavers in the temporarily revived carpet indus try, and of a large number of labourers in the Khorshid Spinning Mill and on various town plan ning, road construction and improvement devices general depression, poverty and unemployment were reduced to some extent. Most of the labouring classes, however, are addicted to opium and prefer to indulge in work of a sedentary nature, or to beg than to participate in any active occupation. The Governor-General has recently opened an almshouse to shelter about 200 poor people and beggars. This has been a long felt want in Kerman. Municipal services Were rendered with compara tive efficiency. Lighting, scavenging and other sani tary arrangements showed signs of appreciable im provement. Typhoid fever was prevalent in a mild form in July in the poorer quarters of the town. There w ere no epidemics. Guinea worm and malaria were prevalent in Bandar Abbas during the summer. The Medical branch of the Church Missionary Society, Kerman, continued to do good work. The levelling and metalling of the main artery road of Kerman, known as the Khiaban Shahpour was completed, and several young trees were planted on both sides of the road. Water was rented from the Zirisf Qanat water supply for the watering of the gardens, trees and roads. Much still remains to be done for the general improvement of the tow r n. The total receipts of the Kerman self-supporting Municipality for the year under report was appro ximately Rials 620,000 (about £7,750), but it appears that Municipal funds are inadequate for the local requirements. The same remark holds good for Bandar Abbas where the water supply arrangements are not yet completed. An Iranian Gentlemen’s Club was opened at Kerman on the 22nd February last and a Cinema (Talkie) is to be opened in the near future. C. H. Lincoln, Major, His Majesty's Consul.

A copy of the Trade Report of the Kerman Consulate District for the vear ending 20th March 1936, is forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. VTrade Report of the Kerman Consulate District for the year , ending 20th March 1936. 1. Trade. (a) General condition of trade during the year .— Trade in general has decreased, and the period under review 21st March 1935 to 20th March 1939 has been far from prosperous. The slump in the carpet trade, due to Economic depression, small demands and fall in prices in America, which afiected the local industry towards the close of' the previous year, continued throughout the first half of the present year, and only changed for the better between the middle of December and the end 0# February when there was a violent fluctuation in the rate of exchange, which reached as high as Rials 160 to the £, which greatly com pensated the low prices of American markets, and was extremely beneficial to exporters, otherwise the uncertainty of the carpet market abroad, and the fluctuating rate of exchange, had a most adverse effect on trade. A company was formed in Tehran in last January, I with a monopoly right to export and deal in carpets, and also control the industry, with a view to improve ' it, and bring prosperity to the weavers, who are at present at the mercy of private individuals. i The formation of this company caused great cons ternation among carpet merchants, especially the foreigners. The general opinion, however, is that it will kill the carpet trade, rather than make any progress towards improvement, for the obvious reason that the introduction of the quite unneces sary and so called “ Middleman ” is certain to raise the prices, even in the absence of a favourable market. («&gt; New items of trade. —There was some activity in the market when about the middle of the year, the wearing of European hats by men was ordered by the Government. This was followed by the discarding of chaddur and veils by women, and' the adoption of European dress. Hats for both man and woman were in great demand for some time, and drapers and hatters ordered their requirements from Tehran, which consisted chiefly of hats of Italian manufacture. (d} New trade channels —Nil. The scheme for exporting carpets by the Kermanshah-Beyroute route, reported last year did not mature, owing to the high rate of freight which wouldi have raised the prices in foreign markets, so the bulk of the exports passed through Bandar Abbaa. (e) Growth cf foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting Appendix II as compared with the figures of the last two years, shows a marked increase in the value of Russian imports (about Rials 810,000) (£10,125). The item of sugar having once again appeared, along with consignments from Egypt, Belgium, and Java. . » ' j Appendix III as compared with the preceding year shows a further increase of Rials 289,802, A ^ (£3,622). Producing country—Japan—goods which * ' \ still due to their cheap prices, find a better market, , 0 inspite of their indurability being indisputed. The Germans have once again, with the conclu sion of the “ lautteur Agreement ” with the Iranian Government during the year, entered the market as keen competitors to oust the Japanese, but the success or fadure of this still remains to be seen. The revival 1 of British trade for the present is out | of the question. (/) The Russian—their trading methods — popu larity—Success or failure. —There was scarcely any Russian trade activity in the province during the year. A consignment of 342 Litres of Benzine, 36,705 of Kerosine Oil, 2,253 Litres of Lubricating oil; and 243 Kilos of grease of Russian products were imported by Sundry merchants from Isfahan and Yezd. No direct consignments of any commodity entered the market during the year under review. (g) Credit offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms.—Under the existing circumstances, when practically every chief item of import and export is monopolised, or prohibited, except with certain undertakings, it is doubtful whether credit facilities will stimulate any business. It is the expensiveness of British goods which is responsible fbr there beihg no demand, and not the credit, facilities offered by British firms in their dealings with Overseas business men. (h) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, eto. —As reported previously, as regards quality British goods are admitted to surpass those of any other country in spite of the reputation they have of being oostly. The Firm Menghraj Lilaram, a British Indian concern, was the last Hindu firm to close down its business during the year.(i) Opening for British goods. —No prospect under present circumstances. 0) Over trading. —No over trading worthy of reference was witnessed. {k) Commercial morality. —As reported in previous years, the commercial morality continued to have a declining tendency. The Hindu Capitalists were encouraging it, as they had to discover some outlet for their merchandise imported in big consignments. But under the present straitened conditions, and in the absence of those Capitalists, the commercial morality has greatly suffered with the local mer chants. The local Banks, especially the Imperial Bank of Iran has curtailed such credit facilities. (1) Working of Law Courts in commercial cases .— The dilatory methods of settling commercial cases in courts is still discernible, consequently the parties involved always welcome Arbitration. Cases of a commercial nature are only referred to the court, when one of the parties concerned desires to prolong the case for an indefinite period, at the expense of both the parties. This is a general rule of proce dure, and cannot be said to only affect the foreigners. A Sulhish (Small cause court) was opened in Rafsinjan about the middle of the year. 2. Finance. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent due to restric tion of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, and bad harvest, etc. —Money as usual was not plenti ful during the year. The dullness of the carpet market, the unsatisfactory condition of harvests, and the trade restrictions, are among the chief, factors for the tightness of money. The average Selling rates between 21st March 1935 and 20th March 1936 were :— Rials 93-20 per £. Rials 696-00 per rupees 100. The maximum and minimum rates during the same period were :— /tials Rials Maximum. Minimum. 101-50 52-00 per £. 759-00 410-00 „ Rs. 100. {b) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. Kerman can safely be said to be devoid of the merchant or capitalist class of her own, and the few who exist do business as a second occupa tion. Most of them are landlords, and do business to establish credits with the Banks and in the Bazaar as precautionary measure, to be of financial assistance to them in bad years. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—Owing to the formation of various Syndicates and Companies with the support of the Government for all important branches of Com merce, most of the merchants are diverting their capitals from individual trading to investing in such companies, which at present give a good dividend of from 15 to 30 per cent. Other instances of diversion of capital from tradP^ to agriculture are also worthy of note. (d) Bankruptcies. —No bankruptcies were brought to notice during the year. (e) Competition among local Banks. —As reported in previous years, the National Bank of Iran has gradually captured the bulk of the Banking business in Kerman since its establishment for the following reasons :— (1) All transactions with local Government Departments are conducted by this Bank. (2) At present they have more branches all over the country, and bills on any of the towns in the interior are accepted for collection. (3) They are more liberal in allowing credits to customers though at higher terms than those allowed by the Imperial Bank of Iran. (4) The Imperial Bank of Iran having curtailed their Banking activities to a great extent. 3. Taxation. (а) Effect on purchasing power. —The introduc tion of fresh taxes which are decidedly higher than the old taxes (which were never fully and accurately paid), has undoubtedly affected the purchasing power of the inhabitants of this province, which, is at a low ebb owing to general poverty of the public. (б) Fair or unfair incidence. —The present system of tax collection, which does not bring the tax collec tors in close contact with the villagers, has not given cause for any unfair incidents. (c) Tax collection .-—The total amount of taxes collected in the province amounted to over Rials 4,000,000 (£50,000) during the year. The taxes are divided under two sub-heads, viz. :— “ Direct ” and “ Indirect ” Revenue. Direct Revenue. —All fixed taxes which do not alter come under this head and amounty to about Rials 1,100,000 (£1,750). 7 Indirect Revenue. —Taxes collected from opium, Araq (local liquor) wine and alcohol and Mustaqilat (taxes on rent) come under this head and amount to over Rials 3,000,000 (£37,500). The total income under the new taxation does not appear to have caused an increase in the total Revenue, the income being the same under the old3 system, but the income of the Government Estates in the province, which were sold to the public during the last two years, no longer forms a part of the annual Kevenue. The attitude of the tax collectors towards the tax payers, and their methods of tax collection spite of constant defaults and delays in payments, lias certainly been very praiseworthy. 4. Military. (а) Commandeering of transport. —Motor transport was occasionally commandeered during the year, but no complaints as to the non-payments or under payments of hire, etc., were brought to notice as far as the Military Authorities were concerned. (б) Interference with trade and industry. —No interference on the part of the Military Authorities was heard of during the period under review. The Military proved of great assistance in maintaining security on the various trade routes, where it was necessary to reinforce the Amnieh (Road guard) posts. (c) Effect of conscription. —Conscription has greatly diminished and the public have got accus- - tomed to it. Most of the conscripts, on comple tion of their Conscription Service are opposed to returning to their humble occupation, and conse quently industry and agriculture suffer to some extent. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation more or less. —A number of Qanats (Underground water channels) which had been damaged by floods during 1932 are still out of order for want of repairs, as a result of which the area under cultivation, which had been estimated between 300,000 and 400,000 Acres has not reached its previous level. (b) The harvest {Crops). —Fruit, though not very abundant, was better than the previous year. The wheat and barley crops were on the whole better. The Pistachio crop was exceptionally poor, the total yield in the province was estimated between 200,000 to 250,000 Tabriz man, therefore the prices ranged between Rials 25 to Rials 32 (Sh. 6 to 8) for the “ fair average quality ” which was nearly double the prices of last year. Special attention was paid to promote and increase the cultivation of pistachio trees which is one of the chief and sumptuous items of export of this province. Henna which is one of the chief items of cultiva tion in the Bam and Narmashir districts, fared well during the year. There was a good demand for this product during the latter part of the year, which was exported to Yezd and Isfahan, from whence it is said it was exported to Germany. The prices rose to Rials 8 (Sh. 2) per man and though the culti vation was not so plentiful as in previous years the income on this article of export did not suffer owing to the rise in prices. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods {Machinery). —No new crops have been introduced though cotton and opium are cultivated on a larger scale, but under the same primitive method. The proposition to revive the indigo plantation and industry at Bam is still in abeyance. The Iranian Consul at Bombay was not in favour of engaging an Indian Indigo Expert, but suggested that a young Iranian with a fair knowledge of English should be sent to India to study the industry. As reported above more area^were brought under cultivation of cotton in the Rafsinjan and Zerend districts to meet the demands of the Weaving and Spinning factories of the country. A special representative of the cotton Monopoly Company at Tehran arrived here in February 1936 to supervise the cultivation. The total outturn of raw cotton in the district of Rafsinjan for the year is said to have been about 400,000 mans, and the prices ranged between Rials 10 to Rials 14 per Tabriz man. A branch of an Agricultural Farm was established in Kerman in November 1935, and started to lay down experimental beds for different kinds of cotton seeds. The Director of the Farm a Government student from the Government Farms at Karaj came from Tehran to open the farm here. He visited the surrounding towns and villages to inspect the culti vation. The department having recently been established, is too soon to comment on it. The Agricultural Bank of Iran opened a Branch at Kerman in November 1935, with the chief object of improving the agriculturing conditions and that of the agriculturists of the province. The terms of the Bank, viz., an advance of 30 per cent, of the Registered cost of the mortgaged property at a premium of 9 per cent, against the loan, and 4£ per cent, on account of valuation by Government appraiser is considered exj^orbitant. Moreover, transactions with such institutions are disliked by the respectable borrowers, who prefer to raise money at higher premium, on a peaceful basis against mortgaging of property than to expose themselves, and ruin their credits in the Bazaar by negotiating with the Agricultural Bank. {d) Fixation of prices and registration. —The prices for the articles of foodstuff, etc., are usually fixed by the Municipality, but these and their regulations are seldom adhered to by the public. A list of the articles of foodstuffs with current prices is given under the appendix VII for ready reference. A branch of the Registration Office for registering landed properties was opened at Bam in June 1935,and is the second branch of this Department in this province, the first being at Sirjan. (e) Irrigation more or less toaier.—There is a general complaint about the scarcity of water for Kerman town, and this always forms the most important •, topic, when the question of the backwardness of this town is discussed. v . . The present system of irrigation in this province as heretofore mentioned is from the underground water channels varying in length from 15 to 25 miles, and to a lesser extent from streams dependent on rain water. As reported elsewhere, about 20 per cent, of the channels damaged by the floods of 1932 are still not functioning for want of repairs. (/) Extent to which, land hypothecated .—The condi tion of hypothecation of land cannot be said to have improved, and it is safe to say that about 35 per cent, of landed properties are mortgaged. 6. Opium. The opium harvest for the year showed a vast improvement over that of the previous year. The amount of crude opium delivered at the godowns of the Finance Department was about 4,700 Tabriz man (each Tabriz man being equivalent to about 106J ounces). The yield for the preceding year was just over 1,500 Tabriz man. The Government buying rate was Rials ^250 (£3-2-6) per man including the 25 per cent, of deficit which is lost in the process of preparation. It works out at dinars 50 per misqal (one-sixth of an ounce). A tax of dinars 85 on account of banderolle is levied before it is issued for sale. A sum of dinars 10 per misqal was added in January last which raised the prices from Rials 1/25 to Rials ’1/35 per misqal. The whole consumption of opium of the province is calculated at 300 mans a month. No export of this product was effected during the year. Contraband opium is still ; obtainable at a lower price, and is preferred on account of its greater purity. It is believed that at least 100 per cent, of the yield is always undelivered to Monopoly Department and find its way into Bazaar for sale. The number of opium addicts is said to be increas ing yearly. 7. Industry* (a) State of industry generally .—Carpet weaving -continues to be the main industry in this province. The amount of carpets and tribal rugs exported during the year, amounting to Rials 7,983,965-35 (£165,452) indicates a decided decrease of Rials 6,252,186-10. The American Firm of Messrs. A. M. Karagheusian, American Corporation for Overseas, dealing chiefly in carpets and dried fruits closed their local branch in September 1935. (6) New industries. —Nil. The foundation stone of the “ Khurshid ” (Sun) Spinning Mill buildings was laid by the Governor and the buildings are well above the ground at the time of writing the report. The machinery is ^^ pec ted about the middle of next year. The question of forming a Company for starting a Hat Factory was considered by Aqaye Peeruia, the e^-Governor General, before his call to Tehran in January, but it fell through with his departure. It is belived that the idea will bh a success, as the province is noted for its good and fine quality wool. (c) Lapse of old industries.—Nil. {d) Electricity. —The new Electric Plant Which was reported last year to be on its way to Kerman was installed in November last. The Plant is of a direct coupling type of 400 H. P&lt; of M. A. N. manu facture. The Municipality alone pays a sum of Rials 10,000 (£125) per month for the illumination of the streets and circuses. The working of the New Plant throughout the year has been quite satisfactory. . • • (e) Demand for foreign machinery. —The negotia tions with the Swedish Concern of Persiska, Com- paniet Aktienbolag, Tehran for the extraction of Liquorice having fallen through ; the question of j importing machinery for the Hat and Indigo Factory having not yet materialised there is no prospect for demand of foreign machineries in the near future. (/) Development of mines, if any. —The working of the coal mines situated in the Badamu Hills about 20 miles to the west of Kerman city has practically ceased. The Enterprise was not a success. The Marble mines of Rayen is also quarried on a small scale, just to make a few small things, like Ash trays, Cigarette mouth pieces, beads (Tasbih) and paper weights. . i oiv * t. u:i \ iv, ;s-u . i r jirvd : .vs 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of communications generally and traffic, routes.—The matin Motor roads which connect this town with other centres are as follows :— (i) Kerman, Yezd, Isfahan, Tehran route. (ii) Kerman Bandar Abbas route. (iii) Kerman, Bam, Zahidan route. Kerman is connected with Shiraz vid Yezd. The direct route vid Sirjan is seldom used. The Mail Service was well maintained and was satisfactory except on. a few occasions, when they were delayed owing to unforeseen circumstances like Snowfalls, floods, etc. The mail service between Kerman and Tehran operates four times a week and a bi-weekly serviceis maintained between Kerman, Bandar Abbas and Kerman Zahidan. The Kerman Zahidan route lost its popularity over the Kerman Bandar Abbas route, with the establishment of an Indian Customs House at Nok- Kundi during the year. The road was very popular long as the import and export of merchandise vkj and from India passed without India Customs restrictions. The bulk of the tea trade from India which entered Iran through Zahidan, and was sent to Bandar Abbas, on account of being cheaper than | importation by Sea greatly diminised towards the close of the year. Trade between Kerman and Meshed is confined to local products such as Henna, Wool, and Fine wool, etc., as each centre gets its own quota of foreign goods and is carried out either by Motor transport vid Tehran or by animal transport direct via Rawar and Firduas (Tun). (6) Construction of new roads. —No further improve ment was made on the roads connecting Kerman with Shahdad, or Kerman to Meshed vid Rawar and Tun during the year. A survey of Kerman Jeeruft Motor Road vid Baft and Isfandeqah was made during the year at a total cost of Rials 5,000,000 (£62,500) and submitted to Tehran for approval. (c) Upkeep of old. —The old roads to various centres, except the Kerman-Zahidan road on which no improvement is made, were well maintained and improved. The Tang-i-Zagh has been widened and has greatly reduced the dangers of accidents. (d) Distance and average transport rates—Summer and Winter on the chief trade routes.—Vide Appendix VI. (e) Effect of motor on animal transport, rates and turn-over. —The general all round depression has reduced the rate of Motor transport to within the reach of everybody that the question of employing animal transport does never arise, except on those roads which are impassable by wheeled transports. Most of the Motor transport returns to Bunder Abbas empty, and welcome any cargo to compensate them for the cost of fuel. (/) Air Service. —No Air Service exists in Kerman, and no Aeroplanes have visited Kerman during the last three years. The two Aerodromes situated to the east and North-north west of the city (both at a distance of about 5 miles) have remained neglected, especially the former. (g) Wireless. —The wireless station at Jallalabad 5 miles from the town, is worked once a week for testing purposes only. (h) Security. —The security on the trade routes was well maintained and no instances of holding up motor or caravan were reported. A few cases of petty robberies and harassing of petty animal convoys off the guarded trade routes were reported and necessary steps to deal with them was taken by the authorities. 9. Social. (a) Standard of living. —The standard of living in this province is decidedly low, with no sign of im provement. The depression in the carpet industry which ranks foremost in the line of employment for the people of this province, combined with the various restrictions imposed on ordinary necessities of life, high taxation, and poor harvests tend to make the conditions worse. They have adapted themselves to their “ Environments ’’and the people seem to be quite satisfied with what they get and can obtain locally at cheapest possible prices. (b) Unemployment.- —Unemployment can be said to be on the increase. The small demand of manual labour in constructional works in the town is not enough to make it uncommon. The local labou er likes work of a sedentry nature, and preters to beg or remain idle than to indulge in active occupation. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. (d) Public health and Hygiene. —No remarkable improvement in the sanitary condition of the province has come to light, and this still Jacks in all phases. Typhoid fever of a mild type raged in Kerman at the end of the year. The town is still full of tuberculosis of every variety. The tuberculosis of bone being most common. Small-pox vaccination is carried out and is com pulsory and vaccinators visit the villages for the purpose. (e) Municipal Services. —The Kerman Municipality no longer receive any monetary support from the Central Government except refundable loans, and has to provide for its Budgets through local taxation. The total income for the year was Rials 610,000 (£7,625) against a Budget of Rials 560,000 (£7,000) form local taxation. A list of local Municipal taxes is appended to this report under Appendix VIII. A four-year scheme was approved by the Municipal Committee and Tehran for the construction of a barrage to divert the occasional floods (similar to those of 1932) from the town and save the southern portion of the town. The Mudjlis approved the grant of a loan of Rials 500,000 (£6,250) to the Kerman Municipality with which sum, the committee very wisely, to avoid any chances of embezzlement, purchased 48 hours of water from the Zirisf Qanat tor the Municipality. As the Zirisf water was not sufficient to irrigate the whole of the main artery road, -which was reported to have been levelled and metalled in last year’s report, the Municipality were once more comp iled6 to dig up the road and remove over four feet of debris to lower the level at a considerable cost. The work dragged on throughout the year at great incon venience to traffic and general public. The Moharram ceremonies were totally curtailed and all private Rouzakhanies (Mourning for the Imams) were stopped, except in one or two public mosques during the first ten days of Moharram. (/) Cinemas .Amin Zadeh a well 3 4 -to-do landlord of Kerman is contemplating starting a Talkie here, but thinks the Enterprise will not be a paying one. 10. Hints to travellers. The best time of a year for a visit, having regard to climatic conditions, and to the buying season, is between the 1st April and 15th October. Kerman can be reached from the United Kingdom by the following routes :— 1. Via Tehran. Distance from Tehran to Kerman approximately 700 miles. Cost of single seat in lorry or buss Rials 80 to 150 (£1 to £1-17). 2. Via Bandar Abbas. By P. &amp; O. to Bombay in 14 days, thence by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly steamers to Bandar Abbas via Karachi taking 6 to 7 days. There is a bi-weekly motor service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and vice versa, leaving each place every Tuesdays and Saturdays. Distance from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is 350* miles. A seat in a postal lorry costs from Rials 60 to 80 (Sh. 16 to £1) and a touring car (which is seldom available) Rials 300 to 400 (£3/15 to 5). A touring car can be hired from Rials 900 to Rials 1,200 (£10 to 15). 3. Via Nok-Kundi. Three day’s rail from Karachi to Nok-Kundi, 1 hence by touring car or lorry to Zahidan and on to Kerman vid Bam, in all 460 miles by road, transit period about 4 days. There is no regular traffic on this road, hence the rate of hire varies according to the type of car required. A touring car Could be obtained for about Rials 1,760 (£22). There are no Hotels in Kerman but accommodate^ of a very poor kind is obtainable in Motor Garages, and ordinary rest houses. Only Iranian food is available. Average daily cost of subsistence depends upon the means of a visitor, but for an average European it may range between Rials 20 to 50 (Sh. 5 to 12/6). There are no regulations in force for special registration of commercial travellers or entry of samples. Every foreigner on arrival must get, a “ Permit of Residence ” if he intends to stay for a longer period. A Permit of residence is Va'id for a period of six months or one year only from the date of issue, but in special cases it may be issued for a lesser period. Climatic conditions are moderate. Fridays are public holidays. Telegraph rates. Per word. Rials. United Kingdom . 12-001 &gt;Rials 4-50 L. C. 0. India . . . 8-00 J Parcels.

In spite of the depressing trade atmosphere in Kerman during the period dealt with and its reaction /u4*vy*v on Unlted Kingdom exports, the report is one of '• considerable interest. I am to express the appreciation t f A *, &gt; of the department of Overseas Trade of the care and ^*4 ^ trouble you iiave evidently taken in the tas ; of f ft** j . / ('Ufcul oompiling this survey, to which the full statistical */ i tables form a valuable addition. I aia. Sir, Your obedient Servant,Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1754-D-10 48, dated the 31st August 1935. I have the honour to forward, herewith, in duplicate the Trade Report of the Kerman Consulate for the year 1934-1935 (22nd March 1934 to 20th March 1935) compiled by Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman.ST. Trade Report of the Kerman ending 21st 1. Trade. (a) General condition of trade during the year — Trade during the early part of the year was mode rately active, but diminished gradually during the second half. Trade conditions in this part of the country have never been so bad in recent years, and the immediate outlook is far from bright. The carpet industry was greatly affected by the small demand and low prices in America, and towards the close of the year practically no fresh orders were arriving from New York. Until conditions in the carpet business in America improve, there does not appear to be any likelihood of any amelioration in trade conditions, as the Kerman market depends almost entirely on the carpet industry. It was noticed that orders placed by the New York firms with the manufacturers here were subse quently cancelled owing to prevailing conditions in America. Another factor which governs the carpet export trade from Kerman is the rate of exchange, which during the year fluctuated widely. As mentioned before Kerman depends solely on the carpet and rug trade, but this is now almost com pletely stagnant and has brought about a demora lising effect on the manufacturers and weavers alike. Trade conditions might improve should the rate of exchange remain around Kials 80-00 per pound sterling, but owing to a feeling of uncertainty there is still little doing and people are adopting the policy of “waiting and seeing” hoping for better times ahead* Up to recently the rate of exchange was to a certain extent governed by the price of silver (now about 3\d. per oz. say about Rials 55-00 per £), but at the present moment, this is not the case,' the rate now being governed by supply and demand. Owing to present stagnation of trade, the demand for credit has fallen off. The general falling off in trade hi Kerman carpets and rugs can be summed up under two headings (a) Exchange insecurity and (b) lack of demand abroad (especially America). The future outlook is uncertain and none too bright. (6) Exports and imports. —The figures for imports into the province, vide Appendix I, show a decrease Consular District for the year March 1935. of just over Rials 800,000 (£10,000) as compared - with those of the preceding year. Appendices II aind III show the imports from Russia and Japan which have decreased by Rials 355,500 (£4,444) and Rials 354,000 (£4,425) respectively. It will be noticed that out of the total decrease ih the imports of Rials 800,000 (£10,000) a sum of Rials 709,500 (£8,869) is due to the decrease in imports from the above twb countries which practically have ousted other countries from the Iranian markets. This can mainly be attributed to the comparatively low purchasing power of the cbuntry itself during the year and also that most of the requiremehts of the people are now being met with locally. The total value of exports, on the other hand, vide Appendix V, has increased by Rials 1,650,000 (£20,625), a sum of Rials 1,160,000 (£14,500) being due to the increase ih the export of Kerman carpets and tribal rugs only, as compared with the figures of the preceding year. This increase may be roughly attributed to the cause referred to in “ 7-(o) ” below. (c) New items of trade. —Nil. (d) N&lt;*w trade channels.—Fox the first time the Kermanshah Beyroute route has been used for the export of carpets to New York. It is said that carpets sent vid Bandar Abbas take from 75 to 90 days to reach New York, whilst the Beyroute route takes about 55 to 60 days. Kerman firms send their carpets to Sultanabad and from there they are despatched with others to New York. No doubt the Beyroute route is much more expensive than the Bandar Abbas and Duzdab ones. It costs about £21 to £23 per ton vid Beyroute, while it costs £13 only vid Bandar Abbas. Firms anxious to send their goods quicker use the Kermanshah— Beyroute route. (e) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting ther efrorh.— Appendix II as compared with the figures of last two years, shows a tremendous drop ih the Russian imports of about Rials 355,000 (£4,437), the item of sugar having totally disappeared. Appendix III as compared with the preceding year shows an equal drop of Rials 354,000 (£4,425) in the Japanese goods, but still they, due to their cheapness, find a better market. It will be remembered that last year a Japanese Commercial Agent had visited Kerman and the goods now imported are only those for which he had previously thoroughly studied the market. In spite of all these activities it is an irrefutable fact that as far as the durability is concerned. Japanese goods fall far behind the products of other countries. ‘Germany’s share of the import trade, as reported previously, dropped considerably, chiefly owing to German synthetic dyes having lost much of their popularity in so far as their use in the carpet industry is concerned. It may be noted that although Germans, Russian 8 and Japanese have curtailed their commitment 8 and activities to a large extent, British trade in the province is practically non-existent. (/) The Russians—their trading methods — popularity—Success or failure. —There was hardly any Russian trade activity in the province during the year. It is said that Soviet Trade authorities in Tehran sent a consignment of 200 large tins of Russian kerosene to their former representative at Kerman, who, it is believed, refused to handle the consignment, and the oil was eventually dis posed off by a third party. A local trader who attempted to sell Russian kerosene in small A. P. 0. C. tins was prosecuted by the Company’s representative in Kerman, at the latter part of the year and was found guilty by the local courts. It is hoped that the incident will put a stop to further similar encroachments on the company’s rights. For the time being Russian competition with A. P. 0. C. in connection with the sale of petrol, lubri cating oil and kerosene oil may safely be put out of consideration. In other respects also, there was hardly any direct business done with the Russians during the year so far as the province of Kerman is concerned. (g) Credit offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms .—As pointed out in previous reports, credit facilities offered by foreign firms can hardly be expected to influence trade in general under the existing circumstances, when there is hardly any trade business at all. No inci dence was brought to notice where foreign firms granted better credit than the British firms, although it is generally believed that British firms are not so lenient as others in their dealings with overseas business men. (A) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc .—As reported previously, as regards quality British goods still hold their own against those of any other country, in spite of the reputation they have of being most expensive. As regards payment British firms would hardly agree to anything more than cash against shipping documents, while other firms adopt an easier system of recovery, though as said above, hardly any inci dence of this nature was brought to notice during the year under report. The Hindu merchants have practically closed down all their business activities, and are at the present time busy in the recovery of their outstanding credits, which does not seem to be an easy task. Some British Subjects residing in Kerman had asked some British Motor Cycle firms for motor cycles on deferred terms, but the replies received were on the whole in the negative. (i) Opening for British goods. —This does not seem to be very hopeful under the present circumstances. (j) Over trading. —No over trading of any com modity came to notice. {k) Commercial morality. —As reported last year, the commercial morality in this town, which was already bad, has deteriorated still further, and the local banks have curtailed their credit facilities considerably. (J) Working of law courts in commercial cases .— Owing to the long delays in the settlement of com mercial cases it is noticed that the parties prefer to come to an agreeable settlement out of court; but even if it does not prove successful, the case drags on till arbitration comes to rescue. The cases of the Hindu merchants who on their departure had asked for the recoveries of the loans through the courts are still in the same conditions, nothing having resulted from their suits so far. One Hindu merchant is still in Kerman merely to recover outstandings of the last three years, and several of his claims are still in abeyance. Others preferred to accept nominal settelments and in some instances to drop them altogether. It is not meant that there had been any particular delay only in the case of British subjects, or foreigners, but delays in the settlement of commercial cases are alike whatever the nationality of the parties may be, mostly because of the complicated nature of the cases themselves. As reported previously very few of the pending cases were settled during the year under report, and law courts due to their expensiveness are hardly referred to, especially in commercial cases, except as a last resort, the expenses on the suits more often exceeding the original sums involved. 2. Finance. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent due to restric tion of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation and bad harvest, etc .—Money as usual was not too plenti ful during the year, and the reason for the prevailing tightness of money has been explained under “ 1. Trade ”. Extra taxation and unsatisfactory harvests may be added to it. There is general scarcity of silver coins in Kerman, in fact all over Iran, but notes appear to be plentiful. The average selling rates between 21st March 1934 and 21st March 1935 were :— Rials 78-90 per Sterling pound. Rials 591 per hundred rupees.3 65 The maximum and minimum rates during the the same period were :— Maximum. Minimum. Rials . . . 82’75 per £ per £ Rials . . . 622'00 per 100 500 00 per 100 Rupees. Rupees. (b) Evidence of 'private capital unemployed or held abroad. —Except in a few rare cases, as reported last year, there is in this province no private capital unemployed and certainly none held abroad. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—Since last year’s report no capital has been diverted from trade to other purposes or vice versa. (d) Bankruptcies. —No bankruptcies w r ere brought to notice during the year. (e) Competition among local Banks. —As reported last year, the National Bank of Iran has captured the bulk of the banking business in Kerman during the last two years. They allow better credit to customers, though usually on less favourable terms than those allowed by the Imperial Bank of Iran. 3. Taxation. (а) Effect on purchasing power. —The introduction of fresh taxes and the increases in the old ones, has undoubtedly effected the purchasing power of the inhabitants of this province, which due to general poverty of the public is decidedly low. (б) Fair or unfair incidence. —People on the whole are very poor in this province. Very few of them can be said to be fairly well-to-do while hardly any can be placed in the middle class, all sharing the standard of living of the low class. In view of this general indigence of the inhabitants the incidence of taxation does not seem to be very fair, because most of the taxes collected are not used locally. (c) Tax collection .—Though tax collecting and the tax collectors, are naturally very unpopular, and there is no exception to this rule in this province, yet, it would appear, the attitude of the tax collectors towards the tax payers and their methods of tax collection, in spite of constant defaults and delays in pay ments, has certainly been very praiseworthy. 4. Military. (a) Commandeering of transport .—Motor transport was commandeered during the period from Novem ber 1934 to March 1935, by the Military authorities when the movements of the troops were taking place ; but, however, no oomplaints as to the non-payments of hire, etc., were brought to notice as far as the Military authorities were concerned. (6) Interference with trade and industry .—No inter ference on the part of the Military authorities w'as heard of during the period under review ; on the contrary the Military proved of great assistance in safe-guarding the trade routes whenever practi cable. Indian motor drivers did not report any' noteworthy interference with their working either by Military or the local authorities. (c) Effect of conscription. —As remarked in last year’s report, while undoubtedly helping to improve the general physique and morale of the younger generation, conscription has had the effect of depriv ing industry and agriculture of a certain number of working hands. Conscript soldiers are not gener ally anxious to return to their former occupation or to engage in humbler employments on the com pletion of their term of conscription, but the public is getting used to it and no harmful effects have so far come to notice. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation more or less .—At least 20 per cent, of the qanats (underground water channels) which had been damaged by floods during 1932 are still out of order for want of repairs, and consequently, the area under cultivation, which had been estimated between 300,000 and 400,000 acres has not reached its previous level. (b) The harvest (crops). —Fruit trees in the province suffered considerable damage through usual hard frosts in early spring, as the result of which fruit of all kind was scarce during summer. The outturn of wheat and barely was again below normal, due to the fact that many underground water channels which had been damaged by the floods were still out of .course. Local authorities had sent a report to Tehran on the unsatisfactory irrigation conditions prevailing in Kerman, due among other things, to the inability of the land- owners to repair the above-mentioned channels. A proposal was submitted by w'hich the work of repara tion could successfully be taken in hand if the Central Government could help by sanctioning a loan from the National Bank or other sources, of ten million Rials, to be repaid with interest within a certain number of years. The last thing heard on this subject was that the proposal had been forwarded to the Bank of Agriculture, who would reply direct after examining the details. The year was a record one so fair as the pistachio crop was concerned, the total outturn in the pro vince having been estimated at between 400,01)0 and 500,000 Tabriz Man, and the prices ranged between Rials 16 to 18 for the “ fair average quality”. Henna has for many years past been the chief article of cultivation in the districts of Bam and Narmashir, the yearly crop amounting on the average to one million Rials.4 The demand for this commodity has decreased steadily during recent years, as the result of cessa tion of export to Russia and decreased consump tion in Iran, and landowners have decided to reduce the amount of cultivation. The only substitute suggested so far is the indigo plant, which could be grown satisfactorily under the same conditions. The question has led to a project of reviving the old indigo industry in the province on modern lines. The matter has been taken up by local authorities and negotiations have been going on with the leading Iranian traders in Bombay with a view to obtaining information on the subject from India. As recorded elsew here in this report arrangement 8 are now being made for the engagement of an expert from India and the formation of a small company, with a capital of Rials 120,000 (about £1,500) whose headquarters will be at Bam, the biggest town in the chief indigo producing district of the province. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods (machinery). —No new crops, with the exception of some cotton seeds said to be imported from Palestine and America, and distributed free to the cultivators for sowing for the next year’s crop, have been intro duced, and the same old and primitive methods of cultivation prevail. The introduction of the new cotton seeds seems to have been originated as an experimental measure, because the outturn of raw cotton in the district of Rafsinjan does not appear to meet the demand w'hen so many weaving factories are appearing in the country’. The total outturn of raw cotton in the district of Rafsinjan is said to have been about 250,000 Mans which has been disposed of as under :— Mans. Exported to India ..... 25,000 Bandar Abbas Factory .... 25,000 Rafsinjan requirements .... 50,000 Isfahan and Yezd ..... 80,000 Russian concerns in Iran . . . 40,000 In stock at Rafsinjan .... 30,000 The pistachio nut having proved to be one of the most valuable articles of export, great efforts are being made by landowners to extend the cultiva tion of the tree in the province. Orders were received from Tehran early in the year that in future cultivation of rice was to be restricted to certain districts in Gilan and Mazan- deran. As a considerable amount of rice has always been cultivated in warmer districts of this province and in Jiruft in particular, the landowners con cerned have continued making representations through the local authorities, inviting attention to the losses which would be sustained by them if they stopped rice cultivation altogether. Instruc tions were, therefore, received at the end of the year permitting the continuance of rice under certain ■conditions. The question of the estalishment of an agricultural farm in Kerman is still under consideration and the local authorities are said to have sent a proposal to Tehran on the subject. (d) Fixation of prices and Registration. —The prices for the articles of food-stuff, etc., are usually fixed by the local Municipality, but the instructions are seldom adhered to by the public, mainly because people can sometimes buy articles much cheaper than the Municipality would allow. It may be a good idea if everybody respected the prices fixed by the Municipality, but in the present case it seems to be harmful. Up to the present only the houses and other landed property situated within the city or the neighbour ing areas have been dealt with. A branch office was also opened in the towm of Bahramabad for the Rafsinjan district. Permission was received by the local Registra tion authorities in the month of March to collect the Registration fees in three instalments in cases where the parties concerned were unable to make full payment in advance. In spite of this, and the fact that the periods allowed for the registration of the various areas were extended several times the majo rity of the houses and estates still remain unregistered and have, therefore, had to be declared owner less”. In the cases where the fees have duly been paid, no documents of ownership have been received from Tehran up to the time of writing. A visit of inspection was paid to Kerman by the Regis tration authorities at Tehran. As the result of representations made to Tehran on behalf ofi^e local editors, permission was received early in th^year to make arrangements with the local newspapers for the publication of notices in respect of registration of property in the province, excluding the property situated in the first area of the Kerman city, the contract of which had already been given to the editor of “ Sitareh-Jehan ” in Tehran. (e) Irrigation, more or less water. —Water for irrigation in this province is obtained, as heretofore, chiefly from the underground water channels varying in length between 15 to 25 miles, and to a lesser extent, from streams dependent on rain water. At least 20 per cent, of the channels damaged by the floods of 1932 are still out of work for want of repairs. Landowners have had to pay large sums for the registration of their properties, hence they could not spare funds to repair the remaining qanats. Water for the irrigation of the big circus at the east end of the town is now being obtained from the Zarisf qanat, and for other avenues from other miscellaneous sources, in exchange for repairs to the damaged qanats by the Municipality. (/) Extent to which land hypothecated. —Land- owners having had to meet a number of demands - ji Hw if . *-*1— n-i i iMi i ^ * . * - Im m ani i m r- - -5 (si) due to recently introduced taxes and Registration fees, etc., cannot help raising money by mortgaging the lands against loans, and consequently it is believed that at least 35 per cent, of the total landed property was under mortgage by the end of the year. 6. Opium. The opium harvest being exceptionally poor, the amount of crude opium delivered at the Mono poly godowns during the year was just over 1,500 Tabriz Mans (each Tabriz Man being equivalent to about 16£ ounces), as compared with 2,COO Mans in 1933. As the drug loses about 25 per cent, of its weight in the process of preparation, and as the amount of prepared opium issued to the shopkeepers, etc., for local consumption was approximately about 3,500 Mans, a deficit of 2,375 Mans of prepared opium had to be made up by import from the other provinces. This is besides the quantity used locally from the smuggled stock, i.e., what was withheld by the landowners as contraband and used or sold for local consumption. It is difficult to arrive at a correct figure, in the absence of statistics but the amount of contraband opium may be estimated roughly at very nearly 100 per cent, of what was actually handed over to the Monopoly Department. An extra tax of one Shahi per misqal (about 30 dinars per ounce) was introduced in the beginning of July, bringing the total tax up to Rials 0-55 per misqal (about Rials 3’30 per ounce). The prices paid by the Monopoly Department for crude opium ranged between RialsjBO and 200 per Tabriz Man. ^ There was no smuggling from the other province 8 nor any exports during the year. The number of opium addicts is said to be on the whole increasing in the province. It is said that in order to help the opium culti vators, and to avoid the circulation of contraband opium, Government has made arrangements to purchase crude opium from the fields at Rials 250 per Man. If this arrangement takes a practical turn, it will surely prove a blessing to the cultivators, who up to now had to hand over their product to the Monopoly Department for Rials 180 to 200 per Tabriz Man. 7. Industry. (a) State of industry generally .—Carpet weaving continues to be the main industry in this province. The amount of carpets and tribal rugs exported during the year, amounting to Rials 13,236,151-45 (£165,452) as compared with Rials 12,076,765-45 (about £150,960) indicates a decided improvement, but it was simply due to the fact that the firms were anxious to dispose of their goods at whatever prices they could, before the intended company at Tehran could come into existence. The proposal, however, for the formation of the company, with a capital of Rials 500,000,000 (£6,250,000) for the monopoly of carpet trade which was discussed at Tehran at the end of December—fortunately for the Kerman firms and weavers—fell through, owing apparently, to its being impracticable. In spite of the fore-mentioned increase in the figures, which only show the export side, the period under report was the worst known for many years, so far as the carpet industry itself is concerned. Prices began to fall steadily as the year advanced and the majority of weavers could not get new orders when they had completed their contracts with the various firms. By the end of the year the price of Kerman carpets had come down between 20 and 25 per cent, while the fall in the prices of tribal rugs was even more, compared with those prevailing in the beginning of the year. As reported last year, the expert weaver and his assistant from Yezd w'ho w r ere employed to improve the weaving industries in this province, did not prove of any material use. Looms for the weaving of cotton as well as woollen and silken fabrics were erected, but the competition in the cheap labour at Yezd and Isfahan did not allow the project to make any substantial progress. The skilled labour employed from Yezd is being paid at Rials 10 per diem (about £0-2-6) while the same labour costs Rials 2 per diem at Yezd and Isfahan. The out come, therefore, is dearer than that of other places in Iran, where labour is comparatively much cheaper; and this is one of the major causes that the erection of the wool carding plant does not seem to be so lucrative as was imagined. The work in spite of this handicap is going on slowly but steadily with the ultimate object of making up the differences when Kermanis w r ould no longer require skilled labour from other provinces. (b) Neio industries. —Nil. The question of reviving the old indigo industry in the province on modern lines was taken up by the Governor-General and negotiations had been going with the leading Iranian traders in Bombay with a view to obtaining information on the subject from India. The last proposal was to arrange for the engagement of an expert from India and to form a small company with a capital of Rials 120,000 (£1,500) whose head quarters will be at Bam, the biggest tow-n in the chief indigo producing district in the province. In order to materialise the project, a leading trader from Kerman, under instructions from Governor- General visited Bam at the end of June 1934, to make necessary arrangement with the share-holders for the collection of the capital § of which had to be subscribed by the landowners and merchants at Bam and the remaining $ by the Kerman Company, Limited, but no active decision had been arrived at by the close of the year.6 (c) Lapse of old Industries. —Nil. {d) Electricity .—The working of the electric light plant erected by Sheikh Abul Qasim Harandi, the former Russian Agent in Kerman, in 1932, has been far from satisfactory. Interruptions are so common and people have become so disgusted with the inade quate arrangements that unless a new plant, which is said to have already been ordered from Germany, is erected in a short time, the owner will have to close down the factory for want of demand. The plant working at present is said to be a very old one, and absolutely useless for further use. The public who have already paid for the installation of lights in their houses are already clamoring for the new lights. (e) Demand for foreign machinery .—The machinery for the wool carding plant, ordered by the recently organised Company called the “ Sherkat-i-Sihami,” arrived from Bandar Abbas in the beginning of March, but certain parts of the engine having been damaged on the road, the Russian Engineer, who had been sent by the A. E. G. in Tehran (with whom the contract had been made) to supervise the erec tion of the plant, was unable to proceed with his work, and the A. E. G. were asked to send an electri cian to see to the damaged parts. The electrician arrived in the middle of May and the damage, which proved to be of a trivial nature, was rectified, the work of erection completed and the machine started functioning in the latter part of June. The engine is of German manufacture, all the other machinery having been supplied by G. Josephy’s Erben, Bilsko, Silesia, Poland. On ac count of the slump in the carpet industry, however, the plant has proved to be of little advantage to the company. It will be remembered that negotiations were going on with the Swedish concern of Persiska, Companiet Aktienbolag, Tehran, with a view to purchasing machinery for the extraction of liquorice, as reported last year, but no definite steps had been taken for the supply of the machinery. A second firm was also approached in connection with the contract for the supply of machinery for the extrac tion of liquorice juice, in Czechoslovakia. This firm offered to deliver the machinery at Bandar Abbas for £130,000 and subsequently reduced the amount by 15 per cent, but this offer being still considerably higher than the offer made by the Swedish firm, the negotiations with this firm were dropped. The question of the extraction of liquorice juice is still in abeyance, and although the authori ties seem to be very much interested in the project, still on account of doubts as to whether the efforts would be worth the trouble, they have not taken any active decision in the matter. Besides, the amount involved is not considered to be worth the risk, since the Swedish firm refused to parti cipate in the project. (/) Development of mines, if any.—The working of the coal mine situated in the Badamu hills, some 20 miles to the west of Kerman city has been very satisfactory. It has now been given out on contract by the Finance authorities for a period of five years, the contractors having agreed to work the mines and make a yearly payment to the Finance Depart ment of Rials 1,200 (£15). A sample of this coal was sent to Bandar Abbas, by the contractors, to find out from the Shipping Agents if it could not be sold for consumption in the steamers. Coal from this mine is obtainable in Kerman at the rate of Rials 25 per 100 Mans (about 685 lbs.). The local authorities had been exploring other spots in the neighbourhood of Kerman city for coal mines. In the hills near Bibi Hay at, some 30 miles to the north west of Kerman, they came across a second mine, which is said to be more extensive than the one situated in the Badamu hills. Samples from both mines were sent to Tehran for inspection. 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of communications generally and traffic routes .—As pointed out in previous reports, Kerman is at present connected by motor road with {i) Yezd- Isfahan-Tehran, (it) Sirjan and Bandar Abbas and (m) Bam-Zahidan. The direct motor road to Shiraz via Sirjan and Niriz has not been used during the last several years, and is said to be in a very bad state of repair. Shiraz is, therefore reached via Isfahan. The mail service between Kerman and Tehran is four times a week and a bi-weekly service is main tained between Kerman-Bandar Abbas and Kerman- Zahidan. While the mail services to Tehran and Bandar Abbas are fairly regular, the one to Zahidan is usually otherwise, mails arriving at each end, sometimes two or even three days later than the stipulated time. The mail service to Bandar Abbas, also during winter months, is often delayed by snowfalls. Mails from Kerman to Bam are run by motor and from Bam to Zahidan animal transport is used. Traffic on Kerman-Zahidan road in spite of the fact that the road is not in a suitable condition due to scarcity of water and presence of shifting sands, has been much better than it was last year. Towards the end of the year the motor transport could hardly get any loads from Bandar Abbas and attention of the garage owners remained fully occupied towards the loads available at Zahidan, as tea is mainly imported into Iran via Nok-Kundi- Zahidan, and the lorries carrying almonds, pistachio nuts, etc., from Kerman are practically always sure to get the tea-loads for the return journey. Trade between Kerman and Meshed is carried out either by motor via Tehran or by animal trans port direct, via Rawar and Firdaus (Tun).7 ( (b) Construction of new roads. —A new allotment of Bials 500,000 (£6,250) was sanctioned by the Central Government at the end of March for re sumption of work on the Kerman-Shahdad motor alignment vid the Sirch Pass. The Governor- General had shortly before this submitted a pro posal to Tehran, recommending the abandonment of this alignment in favour of one from Kerman to Meshed vid Rawar, with which Shahdad could be connected by a branch route. This proposal having been rejected by Tehran, the Kerman- Shahdad road work on which had been stopped since October 1932, was once more taken in hand towards the end of May. The chief reason for deciding to go on with this road was said to be the large sums of money already spent thereon, i.e., about Rials 1,300,000 (£16,250), including the amount subscribed by the land-owners. However, the work was again stopped at the end of July, as the result of fresh orders from Tehran. In the month of June land-owners and merchants from Rawar formed a company, in conjunction with certain motor transport owners, for the making of a motor road from Kerman to Meshed by the old caravan route vid Raw'ar. The levelling of this alignment was, therefore, taken in hand and com pleted as far as Firdaus (lun) at the end of October, when the road was reported to be passable by light touring cars. With the exception, however, of a few journeys by light touring cars, this road has not been used for motor traffic, except as far as Rawar. The Kerman-Rawar section, it will be remembered, was already passable by light touring cars. As the result of Governor-General’s report to Tehran proposing the taking in hand of this road by the Central Government, His Excellency received instructions to inspect the Kerman-Firdaus section personally and send a fuller report. (c) Upkeep of old.—A. sum of Rials 700,000 (£8,750) was sanctioned by Tehran, at the end of March, for the improvement of the Tang-i-Zagh section of the Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road and the work of widening the pass has been going on ever since. It should be remembered that the Tang, which is a little more than a mile in length, is the chief difficult section on this road, and often gets blocked for many days together, on account of land slides resulting from heavy rains, and that a fair number of vehicles have met with accidents there, sometimes attended with loss of life. (d) Distance and average transport rates — summer and winter — on the chief trade routes.—Vide Appendix ( e ) EJfect of motor on animal transport, rates and turn over .—Animal transport is disappearing very rapidly in this province. Motor transport is avail able at such cheap rates that one does not feel the- necessity of employing animal transport except on those roads which are impassable for motor vehicles. Besides, due to the depressed condition of trade, there is hardly any turn over to require animal transport in addition to the motor one. The pack animals, so common on these roads, are hardly ever seen, except on small journeys, not connected with trade, from one village to another. The com petition for motor transport is becoming more keen than ever, resulting in lower rates and smaller turn over. In one case barley was taken to Bandar Abbas from Kerman at the ludicrous rate of hire of Rials 12 per 100 mans. (/) Air Service. —No air service exists in Kerman and no aeroplanes have visited Kerman during the last three years. The two aerodromes situated to the east and N. N. W. of the city (both at a distance of about 5 miles) have remain neglected. (g) Wireless. —The wireless station in Kerman, though not open to public, w T as kept in working order throughout the year and has been used for keeping up regular communications between Kerman and some other important posts, but not in connec tion with trade. (A) Security. —W ith the exception of a few isolated cases of petty robberies detailed below, securitv on the trade and other general traffic routes was fairly well-maintained throughout the province. The Road Guards are to be congratulated on keeping the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road much more safer this year than it has been ever before. Owing to the disturbances in Baluchistan, however, the Kerman- Zahidan road remained unsafe during the last two months of the year. News of several petty robberies was received from the various parts of the province during the month of October. Two caravans carrying wool and other goods from and to Meshed w'ere reported to have been robbed between Darband and Naiband in the middle of the month. Some Baluch raiders carried 35 unloaded camels, belonging to Yezdi Jilaudars, in the district of Rigan on the south-east of Bam’ in the early part of October, and rumours of Baluch raids at the latter part of the same month, in the district of Kashit and the neighbouring countrv along the western borders of the But, caused wide spread alarm throughout the province. Detach ments of troops from Kerman, numbering about 800 men, were despatched against the raiders. 9. Social. (a) Standard of fmnp.—Standard of living is decidedly low and since my report of last year no efforts, have been made towards amelioration. High Customs duties, taxations, poor harvests, all tend to place even the ordinary necessities of life beyond the reach of general public. Products of the dis trict and the country, for the time being, are not on such a larze scale to be placed wuthin the purchasin' power of all and sundry, and the public, presumably^ having had no taste for the better never feel the lack8 of anything. They have adopted themselves to their “ environments ” and not to speak of luxuries, the people seem to be quite satisfied with what they get and can obtain locally at cheapest possible prices. (6) Unemployment. —There has hardly been any constructive work, worth mentioning, in the city or towns to demand manual labour on a large scale ; and it has often been observed that labourers have taken to begging, partly because they find it easier and more lucrative profession. In the latter part of the year, the construction of the Oircus on the oast end of the town, which had long been in abeyance for want of funds, was taken into hand, thus proving work for the more industrious of the coolies who did not think it too strenuous. Employment condi tions, with the exception of a little manual labour employed in the reparation and constructions of roads, were far from bright. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. (d) Public health and hygiene. —No remarkable improvement in the sanitary condition of the pro vince has come to light. Since the Health Depart ments have been placed under the maintenance of Municipalities no active steps seem to have been taken to safeguard the health of the public against the usual and common epidemics. Some type of Flue, in an epidemic form raged in Kerman in the early part of the year, causing a number of deaths. There was another small epidemic of Typhus in the summer, mainly confined to the Jewish quarter and one other part of the town, in many houses 4 or 5 persons being ill at the same time. ^ Measles and whooping cough scourged the town in the spring and summer, and typhoid is always endemic in Kerman. The town is still full of tuberculosis of every variety. The Tubercular Ward in each of the two Mission Hospitals is always full, mainly of bone cases. The shops of butchers, fruit sellers and confec tioners are to some extent in a better and cleaner condition than they were last year, but still there is much room for improvement. Streets are still in the same old filthy condition, the number of sweepers being inadequate to look after them. Small-pox vaccination has become almost com pulsory and vaccinators are alw r ays being sent round the villages. It is said that the Governor-General collected some funds at Rafsinjan from well-to-do traders to open a Hospital there, but so far no active decision seems to have been arrived at. (e) Municipal Notwithstanding the fact that the yearly allowahce of Rials 200,000 (£2,500) allotted to the Kerman Municipality from Tehran for construction work and general improvement of the city, has been reduced to Rials 80,000 (£1,000) and that the Municipality has to find all their requirements locally in the shape of taxes, the general municipal service did not reveal any sign of undue slackness. The main artery road cut through the middle of the town from east to west has now been levelled up and metalled. The large circus at the east end of the town begun early in 1933 has now been completed. The Governor-General put into effect an old project, started by him during his previous term of office in Kerman, to turn an old parade ground, situated near Government House and measuring some 35,000 sq. yards, into a public park. The place was dug up in February, flower beds were prepared and a large number of young trees planted # Work on the big circus and new roads in the tow n was resumed in April and continued on a small scale during the summer. Water from three different channels was rented by the Municipality during the year for the irriga tion of the various avenues in the Kerman town. New and for the most part increased rates of Muni cipal taxation, on articles of food stuff entering Kerman city, came into force with effect from the 6th August. The proceeds of the new taxes were expected to exceed Rials 500,000 (£6,250) in the year, but the amount received through the Finance Office, who made their own arrangements for collection did not at first amount to more than one-fifth of the above estimate. Proposal by the Municipal Council to let out the Monopoly for this taxation to private parties for Rials 360,000 (£4,500) a year were not approved by the Ministry of Interior. The Council succeeded, however, in obtaining per mission to appoint their own men to collect the taxes, as an experiment, for a period of ten days, during which time the total receipts were about Rials 18,000 (£225). At this rate the yearly receipts w'ould amount to Rials 648,000 (£8,100). Since then the amount of taxes collected by, and received through, the Finance office has increased but not so much as to satisfy the Council. The chief improvement achieved by the Munici pality during the year was the construction of a new slaughter house at a distance of two miles from the city. Municipal authorities must be congratulated in obtaining water for the big Circus from the Zirisf qanat. The water has been rented from all the share-holders, and in lieu of the payment of the rent the Municipality has taken over the respon sibility of repairing the qanats and keeping them in working order,9 (/) Cinemas — 1. Talking. —Nil. 2. Silent. —There was only one silent cinema in the town running on a very old machine, and the pictures shown were almost all pre-war. The owner soon discovered that the enterprise was not a paying one, and closed the cinema for good. At present there is no cinema in Kerman. 10. Hints for Travellers. The best time of a year for a visit, having regard to climatic conditions and to the buying season is between the 1st April and 15th October. Kerman can be reached from the United Kingdom by the following routes:— 1. Via Tehran. Distance from Tehran to Kerman. 700 miles. Cost of single seat in lorry . . Rials 87 to 150 (£1 to £115). Cost of single seat in touring cars, which are not always available. Rials 200 to 300 (about £2 to 3). 2. Via Bandar Abbas. By P. &amp; 0. to Bombay in 14 days, thence by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly steamers, taking 6 to 7 days. There is a bi-weekly motor service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and vice versa, leaving each end every Tuesday and Saturday. Distance from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is 345 miles. A seat in a postal lorry costs from Rials 75 to Rials 120 and a touring car (which is hardly ever available) Rials 300 to Rials 400. A touring car can be hired from Rials 900 to Rials 1,200. 3. Via Nok-Kondi. Three days’ rail from Karachi to Nok-Kondi, thence by touring car or lorry to Zahidan and on to Kerman via Bam, in all 468 miles by Road, transit period about 4 days. There is no regular traffic on this road, hence rate of hire vary on the type of car required. A touring car could be obtained for about £22 (Rials approximately 1,750). There are no regular hotels in Kerman, but ac commodation of a very poor kind may be obtainable in motor garages, and ordinary rest houses. Only Iranian food is available. Average daily- cost of subsistence may depend upon the means of a visitor, but for an average European it may range between Rials 20 to 50. There are no regulations in force for special registration of commercial travellers or entry of samples. Every foreigner on arrival must get a “ Permit of residence ” if he intends to stay for a longer period. A permit of residence is valid for a period of one year only from the date of issue, but in special cases it may be issued for a lesser period. Climatic conditions are moderate.

Copy *)£ . lo H 10 d:o.'t.(2) )28/12/34. SEEN POLITIC _ wOMMI Previous papers :— FOR INFORMATION. The position disclosed m this Report shows little improvement on the previous year. Imports declined by about Rials 700,000, and, although the value of exports went up by nearly Rials 3,000,000, this was in the mam due to a temporary boom in the carpet trade, which had passed by the end of the year and showed small signs of reviving for some time to come (§l(a) and §7(a)). In other directions trade was poor, and greatly hampered by continued scarcity of money. The prohibition on individual trading with the Russians imposed m May 1933 was removed in the following August, but there was no general resumption of business (§l(e)). The Japanese continued to make headway, and theirs is now considered to be the only formidable competition to be faced in the Kerman gremarket; even the Rassians seem to have dropped oat of the ranningk§l(d)). This is apparently dae not only to the low prices of the Japanese products, but,to a large extent, to the general thoroughness of Japanese business methods; British and Indian traders will need to show equal energy and initiative before they can hope for increased business.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, in duplicate the Trade Report of the Kerman Consulate for the year 1933-34 (22nd March 1933 to 20th March 1934), compiled by Major C. H. Lincoln QBE His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. fj i ‘ • ^CLOSURE fIV r0fi ElQN SECRETARY” f-eiter '1 7 &gt;'Trade Report of the Kerman Consular District for the year ending 20th March 1934. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions of trade during the year (exports and imports). —The figures for imports into the province, vide Appendix l, show a decrease of just over Rials 700,000, as compared with those of the preceding year. In the import figures for the year under review, is included about 11 million Rials of Anglo-Persian Oil Company products, which in actual fact are not of foreign origin. The remarkable increase in the amount of these products, i.e., nearly Rials 600,000, as compared with the previous year is due to the following facts :— (a) Up to now the Anglo-Persian Oil Company agents in Kerman had been supplying this Consulate with figures which showed the sales of the Company’s products in Kerman town, while the figures for the year under report constitute the total sales of the Company in the whole area of Kerman province. (b) The Russian imports of similar products were probably considerably more than those shown under the various years up to date, the discrepancy becoming apparent now that the Russian sales have dropped off and been substituted by those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany. (c) The rates for petrol prevailing at Bandar Abbas heretofore being below those of Kerman, drivers working on this road bought their requirements for both journeys at Bandar Abbas while during the year under review, the prices at Kerman having been reduced, the difference was not sufficient to give Bandar Abbas this advantage. But for the increase in the imports of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company products, the decrease in the value of imports would have amounted to more than a million Rials. The total value of exports during the year, on the other hand, vide Appendix V, show’s an increase of very nearly 3 million Rials, over two millions of which is accountable by the increase in the exports of Kerman carpets. Judging by the above figures, the province did not fare badly, especially as regards exports. In spite of this, however, the year was distinctly a bad one. Except for the improvement in the carpet trade, business was dull and money unusually scarce throughout the year. This was in the first place due to the general world crisis and the general feeling of financial insecurity which has resulted in the wealth of the country being accumulated in fewer hands and the few capital owners holding on to their money more tenaciously than ever, the demand for money continuing to decrease all the time. A large number of the under-ground water channels, which had been damaged by the floods of July 1932, being still out of order, the owners have had to find money for repairs. A Registration Office having been opened at Kerman at the latter part of the year, money was required for the registration of property, as well as for the payment of other taxes due to the Govern ment. The constant changes which were introduced in the foreign trade regulations from time to time did not help to improve matters, and fluctuations in the rates of premium for export certificates have resulted in a number of local traders losing a consider able. amount in consequence of their speculations in this business. Every year it becomes more and more difficult for small traders to continue their business, and there is more tendency of the few big trading concerns in the country manipulating the bulk of the coun try’s trade at the cost of the small individual trader. Through lack of funds, the Kerman Chamber of Commerce had to close down their office in the latter part of the year, since which time it has existed o.uly in name. (b) New items of trade. —Nil. (c) New trade channels. —Nil. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to \ British interests resulting therefrom.—Appendix II shows a tremendous drop in the Russian imports of over two million Rials, the decrease in the imports of sugar alone being over half a million Rials. From Appendix III, on the other hand, w. 11 be seen that Japanese imports increased, as compared with the previous year, by nearly two lak hs of Rials, and, comparing the figures for the la s t four years, it will be observed that Japanese i mports increased from a quarter million in 1930-31 to very nearly one and a half million Rials in 1933-34. In cotton piece-goods Japan has knocked, not only India and the United Kingdom, but Russia as well, out of the market. Japanese firms were active during the year in corresponding with the local merchants, with a view to establishing business relations. A Japanese commercial agent visited Kerman in the autumn to study trade conditions and to collect samples of the\r . 2 goods mostly in demand in the market. He paid a visit to Rafsinjan, the chief cotton growing centre in the province, wherq he made minute enquiries into the different kinds of cotton produced in the area and the methods of cultivation. Some four dozen Japanese cycles were imported into Kerman for the first time and sold at prices ranging between Rials 225 and 300. So far as quality goes, however, these machines have not been popular in Kerman and unless the prices are reduced still further they are not likely to find an extensive sale. The only competition, in any case, to be taken into consideration at the present moment, and pro bably for some time to come, is that of Japan. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — popular ity—success or failure. —With the closing down of the Soviet Trade Representation in Kerman in Septem ber 1932, followed by the winding up of the Vanish- torg and Bureauperse concerns at Bandar Abbas in April and June 1933 respectively, Russian trade interests received a severe set-back in this part of the country. The prohibition against individual transactions with the Russians held good until August 1933, when a telegram w r as received by the Kerman Chamber of Commerce from the Merchants’ Associa tion at Tehran, intimating the latter’s desire to resume business relations w r ith the Soviet trade authorities, in response to the Central Govern ment’s advice. This did not produce any material effect, except in temporarily raising the prices of a few items of export, such as raw wool, by more than 50 per cent, in anticipation of the Russian purchases of these commodities being resumed. Incidentally, however, there was hardly any direct business done .with the Russians during the year so far as Kerman province is concerned. At the end of the period under report the stocks of Russian kerosine in Kerman were reported to have been completely exhausted, while as regards petrol they were left with only 150 tins, most of w T hich were said to have been damaged. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company agency in Kerman, therefore, commanded the bulk of the market in the above commodities, their sales of kerosine and petrol amounting to seven and ten times respectively those of the Russians. For the time being therefore Russian competition in Kerman may be put out of consideration. (/) Credit offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms. —As pointed out in previous reports, credit facilities offered by foreign firms could hardly be expected to influence trade in general under the existing circumstances. In certain cases, however where, for instance, orders for machi nery, such as wool carding and other plants are concerned, credit allowed by the manufacturing firms would appear to make a certain amount of difference. The popular belief is that British firms are not willing to allow credit. In one case, where the question of ordering machinery for the extrac tion of liquorice juice was contemplated, Swedish and Czechoslovakian firms were preferred, because of their willingness to collect the value by instal ments. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. —The chief reason why Japanese cotton piece-goods have flooded the market, at the cost of British and other goods, appears to ^ be their cheapness. Owing to the low cost of living and the inability of the consumers to indulge in anything expensive, cheap materials find a ready sale, and the fact that more expensive goods may be of better quality is usually lost sight of. Apart from this, the Japanese traders are constantly studying the market and produce w’hat they find to be most in demand. Germany still commands the bulk of business in synthetic indigo, which has completely superseded the natural product from India. The German imports of synthetic indigo during the year were about three times as much as the British imports, and the German product still holds the reputation of being superior in strength to the British product and is therefore considered to be more economical. Up to now the Germans had the advantage of a commission agency for these goods in Kerman. In the beginning of 1934, however, a representative of the German concern of I. G. Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft from Tehran took over the stocks of the German synthetic dyes from the Kerman commission agent and the agreement between the two parties was cancelled by mutual consent. Cus tomers will therefore have to refer direct to the German representatives in Tehran in connection with the above products. It remains to be seen whether business in the import of British synthetic indigo will benefit by this change. At a meeting held by a number of leading mer chants at the end of the period under review, when the question of the importation of a new engine for the Kerman electric light factory was being dis- ' cussed, it w r as decided that 'while in machinery the British manufacturers were as a rule the best, Germany was still leader in the manufacture of engines. The German Alizarin dyes continued to lose their previous popularity and, except in a few cases, especially where certain shades of green are required in the manufacture of carpets, these dyes are no more in demand. (h) Opening for British goods. —The remarks made under the above heading in last year’s Trade Report still hold good and nothing of importance can be added thereto. (i) Over-trading. —The only over-trading has been in the case of Japanese cotton piece-goods, of which there was a certain amount of surplus stocks left in the local market at the end of the year. (ji) Commercial morality. —The commercial moral ity in this town, which was already bad, has deterio-3 rated still further and the local banks have cur tailed their credit facilities. (k) Working of law courts in commercial cases .— The conditions prevailing in the local law courts are far from being satisfactory, and the constant changes which took place during the year among the members of the courts did not help to improve matters. Very few of the pending cases were settled during the period under review, and law courts are never referred to, especially in commercial cases, except as a last resort. 2. Finance. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent due to restric tion of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, had harvest, etc. —The reasons for the prevailing tight ness of money have been mentioned under 1 (a). An exceptionally bad harvest for wheat and barley may be mentioned as an additional cause. The average selling rates between 21st March 1933 and 20th March 1934 were :— Kials 83-11 per pound sterling. Rials 625-48 per 100 Rupees. The maximum and minimum rates during the same period were :— Maximum. Minimum. Riab 103 per £. Rials 74 per £. Rials 775 per Rs. 100. Rials 556 per Rs. 100. (h) Evidence of 'private capital, unemployed or held abroad. —Except in a few rare cases, there is in this province no private capital unemployed and certainly none held abroad. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—There is evidence of more capital being diverted from trade to other purposes. A large amount of such capital was spent during the year on the reparation of the under-ground water channels which had been damaged as the result of the floods in July 1932. As could be gathered from last year’s report, money lending appears to be the most paying investments! in this part of the country at the present time. (d) Bankruptcies. —Further failures on the part of petty traders and shop-keepers, both in Kerman as well as other towns in the province, were brought to notice during the year. (e) Competition among local Banks. —The National Bank of Persia captured the bulk of the banking business in Kerman during the year. They allowed more credit to customers, though usually on less favourable terms than those allowed by the Imperial Bank of Persia. 3. Taxation. (a) Effect on purchasing power. —In view of the general poverty of the province, its isolated position and due to the fact that most of the taxes collected are not used locally, taxation has certainly affected the purchasing power of the inhabitants, which is decidedly low. (h) Fair or unfair incidence. —For the same reasons mentioned in (a) above, the incidence of taxation is unfair. (c) Tax collection. —With the exception, perhaps, of isolated cases occurring in distant and out of the way places in the province, the attitude of the local tax collectors towards the inhabitants has shown a marked improvement during the last few years, and no undue interference was brought to notice during the year. 4. Military. (а) Commandeering of transport. —Motor transport was occasionally commandeered by the Military authorities for movement of troops during the year, but the standing instructions as to the rate of hire having been more or less adhered to, no complaints by transport owners were brought to notice, so far as the Military authorities were concerned. (б) Interference with trade and industry. —No interference on the part of the Military authorities was heard of during the period under review. A certain amount of embarrassment was, however, experienced by motor drivers, including British Indian subjects, by the local Police authorities detaining lorries passing between Zahidan and Yezd, for reasons other than the mere enforcement of transport regulations. (c) Effect of conscription. —As remarked in last year’s report, while undoubtedly helping to improve the general physique of the younger generation, conscription has had the effect of depriving industry and agriculture of a certain number of working hands. Conscript soldiers are not as a rule willing to go back to their former occupation, or to engage in humbler employments, on the completion of their military service. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation more or less. —A large number of qanats (under-ground water channels) being still out of order, as the result of floods in 1932, the area under cultivation in the province is still not up to its previous level, which has been estimated before between 300,000 and 400,000 acres. (h) The Harvest. —Due to the same causes as men tioned under (a) above, there was a marked decrease in the amount of harvest for wheat and barley in the vicinity of Kerman town, amounting to over 500,000 Mans (about 1,500 tons). In consequence of this prices of other food-stuffs showed an upward tendency at the end of the year. The pistachio crop, which was expected to be exceptionally good this year, was considerably damaged by pests. In spite of this the harvest wag decidedly better than the year before, amounting in the whole province to about 100,000 Mans (300 tons), and the prices ruling in the latter part of the year ranged between Rials 20 and 25 per Man, which, considering the low rate of dollar and the1 4 fact that New York is the chief market for these nuts, may be considered to be remarkably good. The out-turn of raw cotton in the district of Rafsinjan was slightly below normal, the plants having suffered from various pests. The market for this commodity, however, remained dull and large stocks were still unsold, both at Rafsinjan and in Bombay, where several consignments had been despatched by local merchants, at the end of the year. Unusual frosts in the early spring caused consider able damage to the fruit blossom, and there was therefore a scarcity of fruit, especially in the plains throughout the province. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods (machinery). —No new crops have been introduced and the same old and primitive methods of cultiva tion prevail. Orders were received from Tehran at the end of the period under review prohibiting the cultivation of rice in this province. Up to now the province had been producing on an average some 200,000 Mans (600 tons) of rice in the year, and this amounted to perhaps some 25 per cent, of the province’s total requirements, the balance being imported from Resht and Mazanderan. No substitute for rice has been found so far, unless it be indigo, for which there is at present very little use. Activities on the part of land-owners to plant more pistachio trees continue. More attention is also being paid to the cultivation of mulberry bushes with a view to reviving the silk industry. The cultivation of saffron at certain places in the province is slowly on the increase. Fresh proposals by the local authorities for the establishment of an agricultural farm were submitted to Tehran at the end of the year. (d) Fixation of prices and Registration. —The local Municipality are supposed to fix prices of the articles of food-stuff, and to make necessary alterations from time to time. The official rates thus fixed, however, are seldom adhered to except nominally, and experience has proved that interference on behalf of the local authorities in this respect is usually harmful. A Registration Office was opened in Kerman in August and started functioning in the latter part of November. The Kerman town and environs were divided into different sections, the time allowed for the registration of property in each section being two months, which was always extended to three. As pointed out elsewhere in this report, the opening of this Office contributed considerably towards the tightness of money, as the ordinary property-owner can ill afford the payment of the registration fees, and, in the majority of cases, has to borrow money for the purpose at high interest. A large number of houses, however, remain un registered at the time of writing, and, the time allowed having already passed, the property will have to be declared ‘ ownerless ’ unless further graces are given by the Government. (e) Irrigation, more or less water. —Water for irrigation in this province is obtained, as heretofore , chiefly from the under-ground water channels, varying in length between 15 and 25 miles, and, to a lesser extent, from streams dependent on rain water. Of the channels which were damaged by the floods of 1932, many are still out of order and, the rainfall during the year having been below normal, many of the streams failed, and large areas of land were therefore either uncultivated or yielded only a small amount of produce. The authorities are still studying the possibility of finding water for the irrigation of the new avenues in Kerman town, but the problem was still unsolved at the time of writing. The question of artesian wells has been considered by the authorities from time to time, but, as usual, the matter of finding funds has been the chief diffi culty. It should be remembered that attempts made to find water by this means more than 30 years ago, with the assistance of the British Con sulate, by the engagement of a British engineer from India, failed after a few trials. (/) Extent to which land hypothecated. —The mort gaging of land against loans continues to increase, and it is estimated that about 30 per cent, of the total landed property in the province is at present thus hypothecated. 6. Opium. The out-turn for the opium harvest was slightly less than the year before, the amount of crude opium delivered to the Monopoly godowns being about 2,000 Tabriz Mans. The amount of taxed opium issued to the shopkeepers by the Monopoly authorities for local consumption in the province during the year amounted to about 3,500 Mans, the shortage being made up by supplies from other provinces. The total income of the Monopoly Department on taxed opium was above one million rials, probably a record figure for Kerman. Proposals for the levying of taxes on acreage having been turned down by Tehran, the taxes are still levied on prepared opium at the rate of Rials 0-50 per miskal. No opium left the province during the year for export purposes. 7. Industry. (a) State of Industry generally. —Carpet weaving continues to be the main industry in this province. The amount of carpets and tribal rugs exported during the year, amounting to Rials 12,076,000, as compared with Rials 9,725,000 in the previous year, indicates a decided improvement, which was chiefly due to a large number of orders having been received from New York. The crisis in America appears to have had a beneficial effect, temporarily at least, on the Kerman carpet trade, the uncertain future of the dollar, and fear for its further deprecia-5 tion apparently inducing capital owners to turn part of their money into goods. Another reason for the keen demand for Kerman carpets is the fact that carpets from Sultanabad lost in favour in New York and Kerman goods were more popular. Towards the end of the year, however, the demand began to fall off, and the market was exceptionally dull by the end of the year. Large stocks of Kerman carpets are said to have accumulated in New York, and before these are considerably diminished, no improvement can be expected. A reaction has already set in at the time of writing. Buyers are rapidly curtailing their commitments, and weavers are being dismissed one after another, as they deliver their goods. The prospect for the next year is therefore not very bright, so far as the carpet industry is concerned. # . . In order to improve the weaving industries in this province, the services of an expert weaver and a few assistants from Yezd were enlisted in the month of November, and ten looms for the weaving of cotton as well as wollen and silken fabrics erected. The work is, however, going on very slowly, as Kerman weavers are new to the work and find the terms offered by their more industrious Yezdi colleagues too hard to accept. (6) New Industries.—Nil The question of reviv ing the old indigo industry in the province on modern lines was taken up by the local authorities during the year. The last proposal is to arrange for the formation of a small company, with a capital of Rials 120,000, with headquarters at Bam, the centre of the chief indigo producing district in the province, and for the engagement of an expert from India to teach the modern methods of extracting indigo for dyeing purposes. (c) Lapse of old industries.—Nil. (d) Electricity. —The electric light plant erected by Sheikh Abul Qasim Harandi, the former Russian Sales Agent in Kerman, in September 1932 has been functioning since. Further houses and places in the Municipal area have been supplied with lights. The plant, which is still said to be running at a loss, has not, however, been working satisfac torily and constant interruptions occur. Ihe re placement of the Russian engineer in charge of the factory by a Persian from Tehran has not improved m *(e) demand for foreign machinery.-The company formed in Kerman early in 1933 and called the ‘ Shirkat-i-Sihami-i-Kerman ’ (The Kerman Com pany Ltd.) made arrangements in the month of Octo ber with the representatives of the German concern of the A E G. in Tehran for the importation of a wool carding plant of 30 h-p, at a total cost of Rials 200 000 A Russian Engineer visited Kerman, on behalf of the A. E. G., in February 1934 to supervise the build ing operations on the site prepared for the erection of the plant, and the machinery arrived from Bandar Abbas at the end of March. Only the engine appears to be of German manufacture, the rest of the machinery having been supplied by the Polish firm of E. Josephy’s Erben, Bilsko, Silesia. Certain parts of the engine having been damaged on the road between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, the Russian Engineer declared himself unable to proceed with the work of erection, and the A. E. G. were asked to send an electrician to see to the damaged parts. In November 1933 the Governor-General studied the question of extracting juice from the liquorice plant, of which there is said to be an unlimited quantity in the province, and of importing machinery for the purpose. A project was set on foot at the end of the year for the formation of a new company with a capital of Rials 800,000 about 50 per cent, of which was pro mised by the Swedish concern of Persiska Com- paniet Aktienbolag of Tehran, who had previously studied the possibilities for trade in the liquorice root or extract in this part of the country, and the remaining 50 per cent, was to be provided for by local capital. Eventually the Swedish firm declared themselves unable to take up shares in the project, but offered to have the machinery delivered at Bandar Abbas at a total cost of £10,500 agreeing to receive the value in instalments. The scheme does not seem to be making any progress. From the fact of the Swedes refusing to participate in the project, it is inferred that the enterprise could not be a lucrative one, and the idea of being in debt to a foreign concern and the latter’s control of the plant for an indefinite period, until the debt is paid off, does not seem to appeal to the would-be share-holders. At the time of writing the question is being studied once more by the Governor-General and the other parties concerned, with a view to finding a solution, but the prospect is not very bright. (/) Development of mines, if any .—The working of a coal mine in the Badamu hills, some 20 miles to the west of Kerman city, which, incidentally, was visited by a British geologist in 1913, was taken in hand in November 1933 by the local Finance authorities, and a quantity of coal was extracted and consumed, for the first time, in the stoves of certain Government departments in Kerman. Other likely spots in the neighbourhood of Kerman town were explored by the local authorities for coal mines in December, when a second mine, more extensive than the one mentioned above was said to have been discovered. Samples from both mines were sent to Tehran for inspection. 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of communications generally .—As pointed out in previous reports, Kerman is at present con nected by motor road with (a) Yezd-Isfahan-Tehran, (b) Sirjan-Bandar Abbas and (c) Bam-Zahidan. The direct motor road to Shiraz via Sirj an and Niriz has not been used during the last several years, and is said to be in a very bad state of repair. Shiraz is, therefore, reached via Isfahan.6 There is a tri-weekly mail service between Kerman and Tehran and a bi-weekly one to Bandar Abbas and Zahidan. While the mail services to Tehran and Bandar Abbas are tairly regular, the one to Zahidan is usually otherwise, mails arriving at each end sometimes two or even three days later than the stipulated time, and the distance between Kerman and Bam being run by motor and Bam to Zahidan by camel transport. Since the withdrawal of the railhead from Zahidan to Nrik Kundi, a few years ago, there has been little traffic on this road except for export purposes, chiefly with the idea of avoiding the Indian customs. The importation ot -silver in transit from the United Kingdom to India -md ‘Bandar Abbas and Zahidan gave a temporary impetus to traffic on this road in the latter part of the period under report. The conditions prevailing on this road, however, have always been far from satisfactory, chiefly through scarcity of water and the presence of shifting sands, and accidents are of frequent occurrence. The trade between Kerman and Meshed is carried out either by motor vid Tehran or by animal trans port direct, uid Bawar and Firdaus (Tun). (6) Construction of new roads .—No new roads ware taken in hand during the year. The building of a motor road from Kerman to Shahdad (khabis), with the Ultimate object df counecting it with Meshed vid the Lift, was started m July 1931, when.il was hoped that the road would be ready for motor traffic within a year, the original .cost for the section Kerman-Shahdad being at the time estimated at about Tomans 75,000. After the expenditure of Tumans 130,000, including the amount subscribed by the local landrowners, however, the work was stopped in October 1932, by whidh time only about half of the section had been •completed. At the close of the period under report the local authorities made a proposal to Tehran, recom mending thq abandonment of this road in favour of a new alignment vid Bawar. The Central Road authorities, however, do not seem to favour the idea, and it ^is expected that the work on the Kerman- Shahdad road will be resumed. (c) Upkeep of the old, —Barring the Bam-Zahidan road, for the improvement of which hardly any attempts were made during the year, the motor roads in the province were kept up -in a fair condition of repair, and interruptions caused by rain and floods speedily rectified. (d) Distances and average rates—summer and winer —on the chief trade routes.—Vide Appendix VI. (e) Effect of motor on animal tramsport, rates and turn-over—Vtrtih. the exception of the roads which are still impassable by motor vehicles, hardly any animal transport is carried on in this province, and the number of pack animals is rapidly diminish ing. The rates prevailing for -motor transport is usually so cheap as to make it very difficult for animal transport to bold out. This is because of the very small turn-over, due to the depressed condition of trade and keen competition. (/:) Air Service—whether used for commercial ser vice.—Mil. (g!) -consequence of the robberies on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas and other roads in the south of the province beuoming frequent in the early part of the period under review, energetic steps were taken by the Military and Bead Guard authorities to improve the safety on these roads. As an extra measure the .local Amnieh (Road Guard) regiment was placed under orders of the Officer Commanding Kerman (Military) Brigade in August, since which time no robberies of importance have taken place. 9. Social. (a) Standard of living .—The standard of living continues -to be ;low, and in many cases bare neces saries of life, such as tea and sugar, cannot be afforded which accounts for the decrease in the figures for the imports of sugar during the year under review by about one million Rials, as compared with the year before. ib) Unemployment —Reparation, of the flood- damaged qans,X&amp;—vide 3 (a) above, and construction work in the city and towns have given employment to a number .of coolies who would otherwise be without a job. The fault of the average Kermani ■lies in the fact that he is not industrious, and would ■sometimes rather starve than engage in occupations which, in his opinion, are either too strenuous or ■not paying enough. This accounts for the fact that, /in spite of a fair demand for manual labour, there is always a considerable amount of unemploy ment in this province. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. {d) Public health and hygiene.—There is still much room for improvement in the sanitary conditions prevailing in this province. With a few exceptions, where new roads have been built and are under the direct supervision of iPoliee sentries, the same filthy streets that existed many years before constitute one of the chief sources of disease and infection. Attempts made by the local authorities to improve these conditions meet with little or no success. The Governor-General gave orders, in the early summer of 1933, for the closing up of bathing tanks in public baths and for the introduction of shower baths. •These reforms were strongly objected to by certain sections of the orthodox classes on religious grounds, and the tanks were .rerqpened after a short time. Cases of typhus faver were brought to notice from time to time throughout the yeai:, especially in the ; poorer quarters of the town. Measles broke out in December, as usual among the children, and raged for several months, causing a considerable number of deaths. An epidemic of whooping cough started in January and was still in full force at the time of writing. The new arrangement, by whidh the pay of the various Health Departments was struck off the7 general budget with effect from the beginning of November last, has reacted unfavourably on the sanitary conditions of the province. According to the new arrangement, the respective Municipali ties will have to finance the Health services in their own areas. The conditions prevailing in the carpet factories in the province have, however, improved consider ably during the last few years. In many cases, especially where more well-to-do and important weavers are concerned, the factories have been enlarged and more attention is being paid to ventila tion and light. Child labour is now rare and the hours of work are not too long. (e) Municipal services .—The general improvement of the town continued rather slowly during the period under report. A main artery road cut through the middle of the town from east to west was com pleted, with the exception of a few sections which will still have to be levelled up and metalled. A new road leading from the above to the main bazaar, which was taken in hand at the end of 1932, has been now finished. A large circus at the east end of the town was begun early in 1933 but was left unfinished due to lack of funds. The old cemetery lying to the south of the above circus was plotted out by the local authorities, with a view to providing land to those whose houses had been demolished to make room for the new roads. As the result of representations made to Tehran, however, on the ground that dead bodies had been buried in this cemetery until quite recently, orders were received at the end of the period under review not to interfere with the cemeteries any more. A new cemetery which was taken in hand early in the year to replace the old one has therefore been abandoned, without having been completed or used. The yearly allowance allotted to the Kerman Municipality from Tehran, for construction work and general improvement of the city, was reduced, at the beginning of the Persian year (21st March 1933) from Tumans 20,000 to 8,000. With this exception, the Municipality will have to find all their requirements locally in the shape of taxes. The Municipal taxes of 3 per cent, on private houses has now been fixed on the basis of a nominal rent of 3 per cent. Houses let out on rent have to pay 8 per cent., while those valued below Rials 4,000 will be exempt from tax. The above house tax, which is being collected gradually for the last three years, is expected to amount to over Rials 50,000 a year. One of the chief problems with which the Municipal authorities of Kerman are faced is the question of finding a water supply for the irrigation of the town avenues. During the last two years water from a neighbouring qanat ’ has been rented for this purpose, but the volume of this water is too small, and various pro jects are being studied with a view to finding a way of solution. 10. Information for Travellers. Kerman can be reached from the United Kingdom by the following routes :— (2) Via Tehran. Distance from Tehran to Kerman : 700 miles. Cost of single seat in lorry : Rials 85 to 175. Cost of single seat in touring cars, Rials 150 to 250. (2) Vid Bandar Abbas. By P. &amp; 0. to Bombay in 14 days, thence by the British India Steam Navigation Co. *8 weekly steamers, taking 6 to 7 days. There is a bi-weekly motor service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and vice versd, leaving each end every Tuesday and Saturday. Distance from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is 345 miles. A seat in a postal lorry costs from Rials 75 to 120 and a touring car can be hired from Rials 800 to 1,000. {3) Vid Nok Kundi. Three days’ rail from Karachi to Kundi, thence by touring car or lorry to Zahidan and on to Kerman vid Bam, in all 468 miles by road ; transit period about four days. There is no regular traflfc on this road, hen«e rates of hire vary on the type of car required. A touring car could be hired for about Rials 1,750. There are no regular hotels in Kerman, but accom modation of some sort is available in rest houses and motor garages, where Persian food could be obtained. Telegraph rates. United Kingdom : Rials 12-00 per word. India : Rials 8-60 per word. Parcels. These must be sent to a clearing agent at Zahidae or Bandar Abbas, but a permit to import the contents should first be obtained from the authorities at Tehran by application through the various Lega tions.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, in duplicate the Trade Report of the Kerman Consulate for the year 1932-33 (22nd March 1932 to 20th March 1933), compiled by Captain C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. : ; 1 hiNCLOcUMS: 1'° | INDIA FOREIGN 'Trade Report of the Kerman ending 20th 1. Trade. (tt) General conditions of trade during the year {imports and exports). —In tlie absence of reliable statistics, the figures for imports, shown in Appendix /, should be taken as being only approximate, while those for exports, Appendix IV, especially in the case of carpets, which form the chief item, are as authentic as could be expected. The total value of imports into Kerman for the year under review shows an increase of nearly Rials 200,000 over those of the preceding year. Taking the various items separately, however, it will be seen that, whereas, in nearly all cases, the amounts of imports in 1932-33 are below those of 1931-32, the figures for sugar show an increase, in the year under review x Rials 900,000, as compared with the previous year. This can be explained by the fact that the figures for 1931-32 represented, for the most part at any rate, the net value of the imported sugar, irrespective of the monopoly tax. In reality the actual amount of sugar imported into this province in the year under review was considerably smaller than that of the preceding year. In other words, therefore, the imports in the year under review, taken as a whole, were in actual fact distinctly less than those of 1931-32. The total amount of exports during the year were about 4: million Rials less than those of the preceding year. As will be seen from Appendix IV, the item of carpets alone shows a decrease of very nearly three millions. Since the departure of the Hindu traders from Kerman, early in 1932, the bulk of the import trade remains m the hand of Yezdi traders and Tehran supplies most of the requirements in the shape of ■woollen and fancy goods, while motor accessories and. parts are imported from Yezd, Isfahan or Zahidan. Two Hindu traders from Bandar Abbas opened shops in Kerman in the latter half of 1932, | but most of their business has been confined to | Russian or Japanese goods and they have had hardly any direct trade relations with India. The year under review can only be described as a bad one and it is unfortunately impossible to see any signs of improvement in the near future. The carpet industry, which is the lifeblood of Kerman trade, had spasms of very moderate activity during the period under review, but was almost stagnant at the end of the year. Most of the carpets made in Kerman are exported for New York and the recent ! crisis in the Lnited States of America has forced 74&gt; ^ (li) Consular District for the year March 1933. manufacturers and exporters to curtail their commit- f ments still further until the situation is more clear. I The frequent changes in the trade regulations caused great embarrassment to traders throughout the year. Money continued to be scarce, not, un fortunately, through any demand for business purposes, but due to the general poverty of the province. The situation was aggravated by the heavy floods | in July 1932, unprecedented so far at this time of the year. Half of the season’s crops were washed away and over 500 qanats (underground water channels), out of a total number of about 3,000 ' in the province damaged. The losses in five-stock were also considerable. The heavy losses incurred ; by the land-owners, in one direction on account of their crops and in another by the damage done to : . their quanats, re-acted detrimentally on trade in general and increased the cost of living. The full effect of this disaster has not yet been fully felt. Only a small number of the damaged i qanats has been repaired and consequently only a j comparatively small area of land is under cultiva- I tion. The price of wheat at the time of writing was 1 about 40 per cent higher than it was twelve months &gt; before. The revival, in the beginning of the period under report, of the Kerman Chamber of Commerce (which had so far existed only in name) by the Governor- General, was a move in the right direction, though nothing worth mentioning has so far been effected by this institution. (b) New items of trade. —Nil. (c) New trade channels. —No start has yet been made with regard to connecting Bandar Abbas with Meshed, via Jiruft, mention about which was made in the last report. Practically all exports from Kerman during the year were made via Bandar Abbas, hence the Kerman-Zahidan (Duzdab) route lost all its importance for purposes of export. A few consignments of no great value were, however forwarded by this route to India, by miscellaneous traders, solely with the object of avoiding payment of the Indian Customs. Thus, the only main trade route in the province is via, Bandar Abbas which, by the way, is occasionally blocked by snow or impassable through heavy rain during the winter months. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. —-While, as will be seen from Appendix I, Russian imports of cotton piece-goods have dropped by over 50 per cent2 the imports of Japanese goods of the same kind show an increase of over 200 per cent. India, on the other hand, has lost about 25 and the United Kingdom about 40 per cent. Under the circum stances, British goods can hardly be expected to compete with the Japanese products which, at this rate, are likely to knock even Russia out of the market. Japanese cotton yarn, of which there had practi cally been no import into Kerman since 1927, was again introduced into the market during the period under report, at the end of which about 75 per cent, at least, of the cotton yarn consumed in this province was of Japanese manufacture. Though admitted to be inferior in quality to Manchester or Indian yarn, the Japanese product is considered to be quite as good for the purpose for which it is chiefly used in this part of the country, i.e., in the weaving of carpets, considering that it is at the same time usually about 10 per cent cheaper in price. in the case of sugar, due to the concession enjoyed by Russia as the result of her recent commercial treaty with Persia, she handled about 75 per cent of the total imports, at the expense of Java and Belgium, as compared with 50 and 60 per cent in the two preceding years. The sales of the Russian kerosene and petrol were about one-fifth and one-fourth, respectively, of those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as compared with one-fifth for both products in the preceding year. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — 'popu larity—success or failure. —Although it was at one time expected that, as the result of the new com mercial treaty with Persia and due to having capable trade representatives on the spot, the Russians would carry all before them, they have not achieved much except, perhaps, in the case of sugar, of which they have handled the bulk of the import trade, as already mentioned under (d) above, and, as will be seen from Appendix II, the total Russian imports into Kerman show a net decrease of over half a million Rials. During the first quarter of 1932 Constant changes took place in the staff of the Soviet Trade Representa tion in Kerman, the headquarters of which was transferred to Bandar Abbas in April 1932 and the Kerman office was closed down altogether in Septem ber of the same year. The Soviet trade of cotton piece-goods received a severe set-back during the year due to the market being flooded with Japanese goods of the same kind, offered at very low prices, and although the Russians were forced to bring down their prices from time to time, to compete with Japan, their trade in these commodities has not gained ground since. In the early part of 1933, the Soviet methods of trading with the Persians, which had never been popular, became still more unpopular and the Kerman jChamber of Commerce, having no doubt been influenced by Tehran, decided that individual trans actions with the Russians should be stopped. The Bandar Abbas branch of Vaneshtorg, which had succeeded the Russian Trade Representation at that place, was practically doing no business at the close of the year when it was reported that a member of this concern was on his way to Bandar Abbas to wind up affairs. (/) Credit offered by foreign firms as opp9Pto those granted by British firms. —Under the present varying conditions of business, brought about as the result of the inconsistent trade regulations, credit facilities offered by foreign firms could hardly be expected to have any material influence on trade. As pointed out in the last report, the only credit inducive to trade would have to be local but, with the deterioration of commercial morality, brought about by the chronic depression in trade, any credit offered, whether local or general, could only be very restricted indeed. {g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. —British goods still maintain their popularity of being, in most cases, superior in quality to the products of any other country. As regards price, however, they are considered to be more expensive, especially at the present high rate of exchange. Russia enjoys a privileged position through the terms of her commercial treaty with Persia, by which j she has succeeded in capturing the bulk of the import trade in sugar and matches. In Kerman the | Russians have no doubt been greatly assisted also by having an influential merchant as their sales agent. The widespread dissatisfaction in Persia at the Soviet methods of business and their dealings with Persian traders, however, is changing the posi tion, and the threats of cancellation by Persia of the Commercial treaty with Russia, if put into action, will not fail to have detrimental effects on the Soviet trade. Germany appears to have captured at least 75 per cent of the synthetic indigo trade, probably owing to the fact that representatives of the German combination of I. G. Farbenindustrie Aktien- gesselschaft have been active in introducing this product into the market and teaching the new methods of dyeing The British indigo is considered to be less strong than the German product, but probably a little propaganda in this direction would give a better chance to British competition. Japanese cotton piece-goods, as already mentioned above, are competing very successfully with those of Russia by the mere fact of being considerably cheaper. (A) Openings for British goods. —It is regrettable to note that, under the present conditions, no im provement in British trade could be expected. A great draw-back, so far as Kerman is concerned, is that there are no British traders on the sopt, interested in the promotion of British trade. Kermanprovides the London market with a certain amount of rugs manufactured by the tribes-folk in this province. The larger portion of the proceeds of these goods is used, at the present time, in the purchase of Japanese and Continental products. The best pistachio nuts in Persia are produced in this province and shipped for the most part to New York. There is no reason why London should not l^be distributing centre of these goods as it used i to &gt;6 in previous years. The question is perhaps too general to be dis cussed from a local point of view, but it is hoped that even such small details may be of some service in getting a fair idea of the situation. Some sort of agreement with the Persian Govern ment or the new Syndicate, if such a thing were possible, would no doubt alter the position. Other wise, it is difficult to know how the problem could be solved. (i) Over-trading. —Except in the case of Japanese cotton piece-goods and Russian chintz, there were hardly any surplus stocks left at the end of the year. (j) Commercial morality.—There have been marked evidences of commercial morality deteriorating. Local credit has, therefore, been very restricted and the banks have been extremely cautious in their dealings with .local traders. (k) Working of law courts in commercial cases .— There has been no change in the dilatory methods employed in the conduct of law suits. For this reason and also because the public are not yet used to the complicated formalities of the Justice institu tions, traders as a rule abstain, as far as possible, from making use of the civil courts and try to settle cases privately. 2. Financial. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent due to res triction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, had harvest, etc. —Restriction of credit, comparatively high taxation, bad harvest and, above all, the slump in the carpet trade have undoubtedly contributed towards tightness of money, which was felt during the period under report more than ever before. The devastating floods of July last, referred to under 1 (a) above, made matters worse. In order to be able to repair their qanats, land- owners have been compelled to borrow, against mortgage, at high rates of interest, or to sell part of their estates at cheap prices. Practically all the articles of food, which were comparatively cheap in the beginning of the year, went up in price, as the year progressed, in some cases more than 100 per cent. The average official selling rates between 21st March 1932 and 20th March 1933 were:— Rials 102*50 per pound sterling. Rials 771*00 per 100 rupees. The highest and lowest rates during the same period were :— Lowest. Highest. Rials 90 00 per pound Rials 112 00 per f. sterling. Rials 845-00 per 100 rupees. Rials 677 00 per 100 rupees. The above figures refer to ‘ free ’ exchange and not to that exchange which is sold by exporters to the Government. (b) Evidence of private capital, unemployed or held abroad. —The stocks of unsold carpets of undesirable size or inferior quality with the local traders and weavers are steadily on the increase, and a consi derable amount of capital is in this way held up. The majority of weavers with such carpets on their hands have been forced to mortgage them against loans at high interest. Otherwise there is no capital unemployed and none held abroad. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—On account of the keen demand for hard cash and the high rates of interest prevailing, many traders have found it more safe and profitable to restrict their business to money-lending. A fair amount of capital has thus been diverted from trade. In some cases people of good financial standing borrow money from the banks and lend it out again at higher interest. (d) Bankruptcies. —Failures on the part of petty traders and shop-keepers have become much more frequent than before. Two of the more important local firms in the town of Rafsinjan were also declared insolvent during the year and a number of traders in Kerman have suffered revelses on this account. (e) Competition among local Banks. —In view of the adverse circumstances prevailing, it is sur prising to note that the branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Kerman have been able to hold their own vis-a-vis the Persian National Bank. This is no doubt due to the long-standing and untarnished reputation enjoyed by the former bank and to the tactfulness and loyalty of the British staff. 3, Taxation. (а) Effect on purchasing power. —The purchasing power of the inhabitants is steadily on the decrease owing to the general conditions of trade, tightness of money, high cost of living and the comparatively high taxation. (б) Fair or unfair incidence. —As mentioned in previous reports, considering the general poverty of the province, although the incidence is not in itself unfair, the taxation presses heavily on the inhabitants and especially on the poorer classes. (c) Tax Collection. —Complaints against financial officials have become less frequent.4 4. Military* (а) Commandeering of transport. —The military authorities have now got regular instructions as to the rate of hire of transport which they may have occasion to employ and, as these instructions are strictly adhered to, there have been very few com plaints. At any rate, no unfair treatment of the Indian drivers was brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Consulate during the period under review. (б) Interference with trade and industry. —The attitude of the military authorities towards the civil population continues to be satisfactory and complaints against officers and men are so few as to be negligible. No cases of extortion or undue interference were heard of during the year. (c) Effect of conscription. —While temporarily de priving industry and agriculture of a number of working hands, conscription is undoubtedly doing much to improve the physical stamina of the young generation. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation more or less. —There has been a considerable decrease in the area under cultivation in this province owing to the water supply having diminished through the damage done to qanats by the floods of last July. It is difficult to arrive at an approximate estimate as to the amount of decrease, but 20 per cent would probably not be an exaggeration. Not only fields, but a large number of gardens, have also dried up through want of water. (b) The harvest. —Floods again were responsible for the damage of a large portion of the harvest and, as already mentioned above, washed away about 50 per cent of the season’s crops. Scarcity of corn was felt badly in several districts towards the end of the year, when prices went up considerably and the local authorities had a difficult task tackhng the situation. The pistachio crop, although not affected by the floods, was unusually small, more than 50 per cent less than the previous year. The price of the nut, however, was good, owing to a large demand so that the decrease in value of the exports was only 25 per cent less than the preceding year. The out-turn of raw cotton was normal, but there was little demand for this commodity from abroad and large stocks were unsold at the end of the year. It is feared that the area under cultivation in the province will not reach its normal level for some years to come, as the damage done to many of the qanats is not yet fully repaired and some of these ■water channels are said to have been ruined for ever. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods (machinery). —The American cotton seed, though believed to produce the best cotton, is not considered to be so productive as the native seed and the latter is, therefore, still sown extensively by the cultiva tors in this province. The Persian cotton expert sent to this province by the Soviet authorities in May 1931 in order to show land-owners new methods in cotton cultivation returned .to Tehran early in the year and it is doubt ful if anybody is wiser through his activities. The Soviet Trade Kepresentation, after the exhibi tion of their agricultural tools in Kerman, in Jam^y of last year, persuaded a few land-owners to^Kiy some of their tools, but these were eventually either returned to the Representation or put aside as being useless, and the old, primitive tools are being main tained. There have been some attempts on the part of a few land-owners to revive the saffron cultivation in this province. (It appears that saffron was culti vated in certain districts of this province in olden days and the produce compared favourably in quality with that of Sistan and Kain.) Nothing has been heard of again about the experi mental farm which was to be established in Kerman and no effective steps appear to have been taken by the authorities to combat the pistachio pest. (d) Fixation of prices and registration. —Attempts made by the authorities to control the prices of food stuff during the year had to be given up as, in most cases, such interference proved to have the contrary result of causing things to become scarce. It is understood that provisions are being made in Tehran to have a Registration office opened in Kerman in the course of the coming year. (e) Irrigation, more or less water. —As already stated under 5 (a) above, the water supply in the province has greatly decreased owing to many qanats having been damaged by floods, and will probably not reach its normal level for some years to come. Various spots were inspected during the year with a view of preparing a report on the likely places where dams could be constructed for storing of water, but the result is not known. The rainfall during the year was satisfactory and above normal as far as this province is concerned. (/) Extent to which land hypothecated. —The amount of land mortgaged against loans has been steadily on the increase, owing to the continual demand for hard cash. 6. Opium. The opium crop was considerably smaller than in the previous year, but the amount of crude opium delivered at the Monopoly Godown (about 2,000 Mans, or just under lbs. 14,000) was about 18 per cerd more and the income accruing to the Govern ment on this account was, therefore, slightly larger. As in the previous year substantial quantities of prepared opium were brought in from the other provinces to meet the deficit fcr local consumption.7? 5 The rate of taxes remained the same as in the previous year, i.e., Rial 0-50 per miskal (about one- sixth of an ounce) and there was, therefore, very little smuggling indulged in. The price of crude (untaxed) opium averaged about Rials 200 per Man (lbs. 6,875) and there were no exports during the year. Petitions were forwarded to Tehran during the year ri^umending the levying of taxes on acreage. If th proposal is put into effect, the income to the Government will greatly increase and, at the same time, there will be considerable saving of expense so far as the excise establishment is concerned. 7. Industry. (a) State of Industry generally .—As pointed out in previous reports, carpet-weaving is the only industry in this province. The total amount of exports in Kerman carpets and tribal rugs during the period under report was under ten million Rials as compared with Rials 12,658,000 in the previous year. As this industry is the chief source of income in this province, the slump affects all classes of the inhabitants. Prices of dyes and weaving materials keep going up and only a few weavers can, therefore, manufac ture carpets at the prevailing prices. The fall in the carpet industry has been fully dealt with under Trade (a) above. (b) New industries .—No new industries were started in Kerman during the year. Projects have been discussed by the local authori ties from time to time to revive the old industries of Kerman, such as the weaving of various kinds of woollen fabrics, of which very little is at present made. The rearing of silk worms is gradually increasing in this province and more mulberry trees are being planted for the purpose. (c) Lapse of old industries. —Nil. (d) Electricity .—The electric light plant imported in 1931 by Sheikh Abul Qasim Harandi, the Russian Sales Agent, in Kerman, started functioning in September last. Only the main streets and bazaars, offices of certain Government departments and houses of notable inhabitants have so far been supplied with lights. The plant is said to be running still at a loss. The proprietor is, however, receiving all possible assistance and encouragement from the local authorities. The subscription paid by the Kerman Municipality for their monthly consump tion amounts to Rials 10,000. The rate charged is Rials 4 per volt. (e) Demand for foreign machinery.—The project of importing a cotton spinning mill plant for erection at Rafsinjan has fallen through awing to various difficulties. In the month of May it was for the first discovered that Rafsinjan cotton would not yield 20-count yarn in such a dry climate and at such a high alti tude. Three of the directors proceeded to Tehran in June to discuss the question in detail with the Minister of Court, but returned in July without having come to a satisfactory decision. The matter was shelved in August owing to the inability of the share-holders to subscribe more funds on account of losses sustained by them as the result of the previous month’s floods. Mr. Dinshaw N. Pavri, a Mill Manager of Bombay, who had visited Meshed with the idea of studying the possibility of erecting a spinning mill in that city, arrived in Kerman at the end of September to study the same problem in Kerman. After returning to India and discussing the matter with his princi pals in Bombay, he wrote to one of the directors in Kerman in the month of November suggesting that the share-holders should first assure themselves of the coal and water supplies in this province before the Parsis in Bombay could interest themselves in the enterprise. In the month of January the Governor-General suggested to Tehran that, in view of the scarcity of money and the share-holders’ inability to raise further funds, the Kerman Spinning mill concern should either be amalgamated with that of Yezd, or taken over by the Syndicate in Tehran, and, failing these two alternatives, the one-third of the capital deposited by the share-holders at the Persian National Bank should be returned to them. Finally orders were received from Tehran, in the month of February, to re-imburse the amount to the share-holders. The Governor-General, however, induced the share holders to agree to the money being utilised for the formation of a different company, with a capital of Rials 1,000,000 whose aim it would be to promote the weaving industries of Kerman and, among other things, import a wool-carding machine for the purpose. One of the chief carpet weavers in Kerman imported a wool-carding machine from Germany in the early part of the year. The machine is smaller than that owned by the firm of Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Limited, but is said to be of a more up-to-date type. (/) Development of Mines, if any .—Further reports have been prepared by the local authorities and sent to Tehran, from time to time, on the copper and coal mines in the province, but so far without any definite result, 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of communications generally .—Kerman is connected by motor road with (a) Yezd-Isfahan- Tehran, (b) Sirjan-Bandar Abbas and (c) Bam- Zahidan. The direct motor road to Shiraz, via Sirjan and Niriz, is now seldom used and is usually6 unsafe. Rawar, a town some 140 miles to the north, on the Kerman-Meshed caravan route, can be reached by touring cars. All the motor roads in the province suffered serious damages from the floods of last July. The Kerman- Bandar Abbas motor road was washed away in many places near the Tang-i-Zagh, causing interrup tion to the mail service. The bi-weekly mail service between Kerman and Bandar Abbas was changed to a weekly one in the month of September, owing to the previous postal contract having expired and there being no offers for a new one. The bi-weekly service was eventually restored in the month of November after the autho rities had sanctioned an increase of Tumans 200 per mensem on the previous contract. New post offices were opened at Zarand and Rawar at the end of 1932. (6) Construction of new roads. —The work on the Kerman-Khabis motor alignment, via the Sirch Pass, has not been resumed again since it was post poned in October last. It is said that about one half of the Pass has so far been made practicable for touring cars. No other new roads were taken in hand during the year. (c) Up-keep of old. —The Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road was slightly improved at Tang-i-Zagh in the early part of the year. Work of repairs on all motor roads has been constantly carried on and damages done by rain, etc., have been promptly attended to. (d) Distances and average rates (summer and winter) on the chief trade routes.—Vide Appendix V. (e) Effect of motor on animal transport, rates and turn-over. —Animal transport is steadily disappearing on the motor roads. Even in the case of places not accessible by motor lorries direct, a longer and round about motor road is usually preferred. For example, the direct caravan route to Meshed, via Rawar, is now used less and less, and goods are often sent to and fro via Tehran by motor transport. Owing to the general stagnation of trade and the scarcity of cargo, the rates of motor transport were ludicrously low during the year. For example, in the cases of Kerman-Bandar Abbas and Kerman- Yezd, the rates prevailing at the end of the year Were less than half of what they had been six months before. The turn-over is, therefore, infinitesimal, with hardly any margin for profit. (/) dir Service—whether used for commercial service. —No aeroplanes visited Kerman during the year. (g) Necwn'ty.—Desultory robberies continued on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road, chiefly by Farsi robbers, during the year, but to a lesser extent than before. Security on trade routes has, however, improved considerably and a number of well-known robbers were caught and severely dealt with, in some cases receiving capital punishment. No robberies took place on the other roads in the province. 9. Social. (a) Standard of living. —There has been no im provement in the standard of living in the province, which continues to be distinctly low. The damages done to qanats by the floods, however, gave emi^v- ment to a considerable number of coolies, who w®Ri otherwise be without jobs. The construction work on the various new roads in the town also helped to ameliorate the situation. (b) Unemployment. —The number of the un employed decreased during the year for reasons mentioned above. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. (d) Public health and hygiene. —There has been no appreciable improvement in the sanitary condi tions in the province. The Director-General of the Health Department, however, paid a visit to Kerman during the year, and the vaccination agents have been more active in the performance of their duties. Typhus in an epidemic form raged in the poorer quarters of the town between the months of April and July 1932, and an epidemic of influenza caused a number of deaths in February 1933. (e) Municipal services. —The metalling of the main road cut through the town in 1929 and the other new roads branching from this is not yet completed. Trees were planted on the two sides of the above roads at the end of the year, only a few of which have taken, and water from a neigh bouring qanat was rented for this purpose. A large circus at one end of the main road was taken in hand, but the constructions had to be postponed for want of funds. A number of ditches round the city were filled in and the plots thus reclaimed are now being offered for sale or given as compensation to parties whose houses were demolished to make way for the new roads. Plants for other new roads in the city have been prepared and sent up to Tehran for approval. The funds at the disposal of the Municipality are far too small to meet all the above expenditure. The regular yearly budget for the Kerman Muni cipality amounts to Rials 120,000. The muni cipal taxes collected locally have not so far exceeded Rials 150,000 a year. An additional yearly allotment of Rials 200,000 had been sanc tioned from Tehran for construction work on new roads in the town. The local authorities had applied to Tehran for the increase of the latter amount, but received an intimation, at the end of the year, that, owing to shortage of funds, this would, on the contrary, be reduced to Rials 80,000. The local authorities are, therefore, endeavouring to find the deficit for their requirements locally. Steps are being taken to collect the house-tax of 3 per cent on the annual rent, which was to be intro duced in March 1931 and which, except in a very7 few cases, has not been recovered up to now. A nominal rent of 10 per cent on the value of houses exceeding Rials 4,000 in price has been recom mended. The question of raising the municipal taxes on the various articles of export and import, as well as on certain local commodities, is also under consideration. The chief improvement during the year was the put^* up of electric lights in the principal quarters of the city which, by the way, consume between Rials 10,000 and 11,000 a month of the Muni cipality. 10. Information for Travellers. Kerman can be reached from the United Kingdom by the following routes:— (1) Via Tehran. Distance from Tehran to Kerman . . 700 miles. Cost of a single seat in a lorry . Rials. 100 to 200 Cost of a single seat in a touring car „ 150 to 300 (2) Via Bandar Abbas. By P. &amp; O. to Bombay in 14 days, thence by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly steamers, taking six to seven days. There is a bi-weekly motor service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and vice versd leaving either place every Monday and Thursday. Distance from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is 345 miles. A seat in a postal lorry costs from Rails 75 to 150 and a touring car can be hired for Rails 800 to 1,000. (3) Vift Nok Kundi. Three days’ rail from Karachi, thence by touring car or lorry to Zahidan (Duzdab) and on to Kerman vid Bam, in all 468 miles by road; transit period about 4 days.

A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Officiating Consul, Kerman. i IN tivPY’S Mo ; w* 3 *• jTrade Report of the Kerman Consular District for the year ending 20th March 1932. 1. Trade. _ (a) General conditions of Trade during the year (imports and exports ).—The total value of imports into Kerman for the year under review, given in Appendix I, shows a decrease, as compared with the previous year, of nearly a million krans. In quantity however the decrease has been more than 33 per cent, but, owing to the substantial rise in prices, the difference in value is not remarkable. The imports by the Hindu traders during the year were negligible because at the end of the pre vious year they had already started winding up their foil si ness owing to the .exchange difficulties. { The Hindu traders who had established themselves in Kerman for over a century and had handle 45 per cent, of the Kerman import trade, prior to the estab lishment of the Soviet Trade Representation, and 35 per cent, up to the time of the enforcement of the new Monopoly Law, closed down altogether during the year under report. Their places have been taken by various local Parsi and Mussalman Yezdi traders, who by the way do not grant to shopkeepers the same facilities allowed by the British Indian traders in the matter of payment on the instalment system, etc. Stocks were over-imported in the following lines, viz. :— Russian piece-goods, Woollen goods, and Tea during the year, whereas the actual consumption may be estimated at about 50 per cent, of the pre vious year. The economic condition of the Province has gone from bad to worse and the year ended with a con siderable adverse balance in the general trade of the country. Money has been none too plentiful and the existing trade regulations have undoubtedly had a detrimental effect on commerce in general. The fluctuation in exchange rates has made the position of the traders very uncertain. Increased taxation has depleted the ready cash of the popula tion and although prices of all imports connected with the carpet trade have risen considerably, the corresponding rates obtained from sale of the finished article have not increased in proportion, the result being that weavers have more or less been carrying on their business at a substantial loss. It is of course natural that credit, under such circumstances, should be restricted. The present burden of taxation under which the country is labouring has the tendency to reduce trade and impoverish the population. (6) New items of trade .—No attempts were made by traders in the province to embark on any new lines during the year under review. (c) New trade channels .—There has been a pro posal to connect Bandar Abbas with Meshed, via Jiruft, but no steps have so far been taken in the matter. The Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road continued to remain'the main trade route and its only competitor, the Kerman-Zahidan (Duzdab) road, has lost its importance owing to railhead having been removed from Zahidan to Nok Kundi, a distance of 138 miles. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom .—Appendix II shows the extent to which Russian trade has in creased. This will now establish itself more firmly as the result of the recent Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty. There is a corresponding decrease in British trade especially as the Russians are flooding the market with cotton piece-goods the import of which from the United Kingdom has fallen by about 60 per cent., as compared with the previous year. In ' 1928-29 the figures w T ere seven times greater than those in the year under review. Russia’s share in the import of kerosene and petrol was one-fifth of that of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as com pared w r ith one-fourth and one-third respectively in the year 1930-31. ' Germany’s share of the import trade has dropped further. She has not been able to regain her popularity as regards synthetic dyes, the import of which shows a further decline as per Appendix I. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — popu larity—Success or failure .—The Russians, by their system of barter, continue to take full advantage of the foreign Trade Monopoly Law, the introduc tion of which is detrimental to the import of goods from other foreign countries. They have a competent i Trade Representative in Kerman, who allow r s faci- * lities to their local sales agent. Nevertheless, great dissatisfaction exists among the public on account of the unusual rise in the prices of Russian sugar and matches. At the time of writing Java and Belgian sugar have practically disappeared from the Kerman Province. (/) Credit offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms .—As the result of the new Trade Monopoly Law r and the Exchange Control Regulations, which have wrought great changes in trade conditions, the actual credit formally offered by foreign firms abroad does not appear to be as important as it used to be. In fact the only credit iuducive to trade at present is local. This also has2 I'.eou considerably restricted since the departure of the Hindu traders. Most of the sales are now made on cash payments so much so that retail sellers have been obliged to curtail their transactions. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. —Since the signing of the Kuaso- Persian Commercial Treaty the question of the popularity of foreign goods on account of quality or price does not appear to be of much significance. British goods still hold the reputation of being of a better quality though at the same time more expen sive but, as already stated, their import has dec reased considerably—as much as 60 per cent, in the case of piece-goods. For instance, Russian chintz is not of a superior quality nor is its colour fast—the Russian sugar is decidedly inferior, matches from Russia retailed in the local bazaars are of a very low grade and are not appreciated, still the market is flooded with these products. There has been no noticeable change in the credit allowed by German firms who accept 20 to 30 per cent, with orders and the balance against delivery of goods at the ports of entry into Persia. Their share of the import trade has, however, dropped further as reported above. (A) Openings for British goods. —This does not seem to be very hopeful under the present conditions. Manchester cotton-goods have been for the most part ousted from the market and the import of sugar from Java and Belgium in connection with which British capital and the British carrying trade were involved has altogether ceased. India’s share in her chief import of cotton piece- goods into this district has fallen by 70 per cent, since the year 1928-29. A remarkable increase in the import of cotton yarn from India,was noticeable during the year causing an overstocking of the market. Should, however, the Spinning Mill project, vide ‘ INDUSTRY ’ (/) below, materialize this item of Indian trade will also receive a set-back. It is suspected by the way that a part of the cotton yarn shown as having been imported from India is actually of Japanese origin. One of the drawl&gt;acks hitherto experienced in pushing British trade is that the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd., the only British firm exporting carpets from Kerman are not interested in imports, finding it more convenient to sell the export certi ficates to importers not particularly interested in British trade. This firm handles about 25 per cent, of the trade in Kerman carpets. {i) Overtrading. —The value of imports during the year decreased by about a million krans in spite of the fact of these being in many cases in excess of the actual requirements and resulting in large surplus stocks being left in the hands of traders at the end of the year. (j) Commercial morality. —Local traders do busi ness, for the most part, on a small scale and lead a hand to mouth existence. With the departure of the British Indian traders from Kerman they find it verv hard to meet their obligations, and a few failures have been recorded amongst them. (A) Working of Law Courts in Commercial cases .— Owing to the long delays in the settlement of cases by the small Causes Court and in the hearing of appeals, very few commercial disputes are referred to the Law Courts in Kerman, claimants generally finding it more advantageous to come to settlements^ out of court. The Indian traders had various outstanding claims and were obliged on their departure, to accept nominal settlements and in some instances to drop them altogether. 2. Financial. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent due to restric tion of credit exchange, in-security, extra taxation, had harvests. —As already stated money has been none too plentiful and the existing trade regulations have undoubtedly had a detrimental effect on commerce in general. The principal factor contri buting towards tightness of money has been the decline in the carpet trade. The population is labouring under heavy taxation though the fall in price of grain, as compared with previous years, has alleviated the hardship to a certain extent. The average official selling rates between 22nd March 1931 and 20th March 1932 were :— krans 66'70 per £. „ 538-75 per Rs. 100. Maximum rates during the year krans 90 per £. Minimum rates during the year krans 60-60 per £. Maximum rates during the year krans 680-00 per Rs. 100. Minimum rates during the year krans 456-00 per Rs. 100. The rates of the kran exchange ruling in the bazaars were however more favourable than the Bank rates quoted above and a large amount of exporters’ Exchange was, therefore, sold in the open market. {h) Evidence of private capital, unemployed or held abroad. —A considerable percentage of their capital is always held up in this province by local dealers in unsold stocks of carpets, otherwise there is very little capital lying idle and none held abroad. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purpose or vice vers A.—Nil. (d) Bankruptcies. —The important traders in Ker man are either Yezdi or Parsi merchants of good standing and no bankruptcies of importance were reported during the year. The failure of a few Kerman retail sellers has already been ref erred, to above. (e) Competition among local Banks. —The Persian l National Bank has deprived the Imperial Bank of Persia of a good deal of its business but not of its popularity. It allows local traders more credit |facilities which in view of the present tightness of money is a source of great help to their business. \Yith the departure of the Indian traders from Kerman the Imperial Bank of Persia have no doubt lost a considerable and not unimportant part of their clientele. 3. Taxation. The heavy increase in the Customs taxes on the principal articles of import has greatly lessened the purchasing power of the inhabitants whose resources are diminishing rapidly on account of the slump in the carpet trade, the chief industry of the pro vince. No new Municipal taxes were announced during the year, but those already in force help a good deal to add to the already high prices of food stuffs. 4. Military. (a) Commandeering of transport. —The Military authorities have been considerate in their methods of commandeering transport and no complaints have been heard of, though they have had occasion to send out troops at various times during the year. There were no cases of undue interference with Indian drivers. (b) Extortions and interference with trade and industry. —Complaints against Military subordinates have been fewer than in previous years and cases brought to the notice of their superiors have been dealt with drastically. There has* been no inter ference with trade and industry on the part of the Military, except in the cases of conscription where a number of qualified weavers have been enlisted, but as the carpet industry is not at present in full swing the effect has not been so important. (c) Effect of conscription. —The public are getting more accustomed to the rules and regulations of conscription and the authorities are more careful in adhering to the letter of the law. 5. Agriculture. (а) Area under cultivation more or less. —There has been no noticeable increase in the area under cultivation which appears to remain the same as before, viz., between 300,000 and 400,000 acres. Owing to the greater demand for articles of export, land-owners have been endeavouring to increase the number of pistachio gardens and now sow more cotton with the result that the area under wheat, barley and millet cultivation was smaller than in previous years. (б) The harvest. —There being no invasions by locusts during the year under report, the outturn of the two main crops, wheat and barley, was sub stantial and the prices for these commodities lower than the average for the last 15 years. The production of pistachio nuts did not reach the average figure owing to the crop having been damaged by insects. The total export was in con sequence much below that of the previous year in spite of a bigger demand. Almonds were exported in greater quantities owing to a plentiful harvest. The cotton crop was fairly good and the decrease in the quantity exported was due to the fact that the greater part of the produce was used in the province for the weaving of ‘ Karbas ’, a locally made cotton fabric of rather coarse texture, w r hich has, to a certain extent, been made a substitute for calico (T. cloth). It might be mentioned that the manufacture of this article has increased extensively in the districts on account of the great rise in the price of foreign cotton fabrics, and fetches good prices. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods {machinery ).—American cotton seed is now sown in greater quantities than the Egyptian seed, as experiments with the former have given more satisfactory results. The Russians are showing the land-owners the improved and modern methods for cotton cultivation, through a Persian agent, who has his headquarters at Rafsinjan, the chief cotton producing centre in the province. In the month of January the Russians gave an exhibition of their agricultural tools which did not create much impression on the cultivators who decided that their present methods of cultivation were more suited to their requirements. Horses had to be employed for the pulling of the ploughs exhibited, while only bullocks are used in the Ker man province and these too are as a rule in a miser able condition. No fresh attempts were made during the year to extend the cultivation of the indigo plant. There was a talk, during the year, of the Persian Government establishing an experimental farm in Kerman, but nothing has so far materialized. (d) Fixation of prices and registration. —The local Municipality has done little to control the prices ruling during the year under report, as owing to sufficient stocks of grain available, there was no need for this. An office for registration of property has not yet been opened in Kerman but it is expected that when one does start functioning there will be a good many disputes as regards land titles. (e) Irrigation, more or less water .—There has been no change in the old and primitive method of irri gation. AVater is supplied chiefly by the qanat system and as, in various cases, a qanat is owned by numerous owners, the work of repair, which is essential for the proper up-keep of these under ground channels, is a difficult task, with the result that owing to neglect the bulk of the water in these channels decreases every year, Nothing further has been heard of the irrigation scheme in connection with the Halil Rood in Jiruft, a report on which was prepared by the representative from the Ministry of National Economy in 1931.4 The rainfall in the province during the year under review was not quite as satisfactory as in the pre vious year. Shortage in the rainfall in this part of the country affects the water in the qanats available for irrigation purposes. (./) Extent to which land hypothecated .—Owing to the high cost of living and the fall in the price of grain, the condition of the smaller land-owners has gone from bad to worse and the Parsi traders, who alone are in a position to advance hard cash against mortgage of lands, are steadily becoming land pro prietors because of default in many cases on the part of their debtors to pay off their loans with accumulated interest, which is charged at a rate varying from 18 to 25 per cent, per annum. 6. Opium. The opium crop was a good one compared with that of the previous year, the output having increased by about 250 per cent. According to the new law the tax for prepared opium in the Kerman province was reduced from krans 2*35 to krans 0-50 per miskal from the begin ning of the Persian year (22nd March), as the result of which there was less temptation for smuggling and the greater part of the produce was taken to the Monopoly godown. The difference in price between taxed and con traband opium not being very great, the Monopoly authorities were able to sell larger quantities to the shop-keepers for local consumption. As a matter of fact contraband opium was, in many cases sold at practically the same, or slightly below, the taxed article and it is because the opium prepared in the Monopoly godown is as a rule inferior in quality to that prepared privately by the smugglers that the contraband variety had any sale at all. The chief source of income of the Monopoly Department is from the sale of the taxed opium to the shop-keepers as, otherwise, the opium that is taken to the Monopoly godown either remains unsold or is bought by traders for export at little or no profit. The income accruing to the department on their local sales, for Kerman city alone, was about Tumans 30,000 during the period under review, as compared with Tumans 4,000 during the previous year. Taking into consideration the decrease in the tax rate (from krans 2-35 to krans 0*50), the amount of taxed opium sold by the Monopoly authorities for local consumption, during the year under report, increased by over 30 per centum, as compared with the sales in the previous year. As the result of these large sales the Monopoly authorities found a deficit in their stocks and had to get a considerable amount— about 600 Tabriz Mans—of prepared opium from Shiraz and Yezd. Smuggling into Kerman from other provinces was insignificant-and the searching of private premises by the excise authorities was not usually resorted to. The fines collected on account of contraband amounted to about Tumans 3,000. The price of the crude, untaxed opium (for export) ranged between krans 175 and 190 per Tabriz Man, during the period under report and the amount of export (vid Ispahan) was about 500 Mans (about lbs. 3,250). 7. Industrv. &lt; (a) State of Industry generally. —Kerman’s only industry is carpet weaving which has so far accounted for about 75 per cent, of the exports. As already stated generally speaking, this industry has ceased to pay on account of the rise in the prices of all imports in connection with the carpet trade, and also the rise in the prices of the necessaries of life. The carpet firms have greatly curtailed their orders and only those weavers who have means of their own or are able to borrow at high rates of ! interest (15 to 20 per cent.) are in a position to carry on. - k Details of the exports during the year are given in Appendix III, while figures for the preceding three years can be seen in Appendix IV. In spite of the slump in this industry as explained above the actual exports during the period under review show an increase of over a million krans as com pared with the previous year. The explanation for this is (a) The Kerman carpet is over a year on the loom and there is in consequence a distinct difference between the state of the market and that of the weaving industry. {b) According to the new laws the import of foreign goods is only permitted against the export of Persian products of an equal value. There has, therefore, been a rush in the export of carpets in order to obtain permits for the import of other merchandise in return. In this connection it may be mentioned that rugs and carpets exported during the year were not all finished on the looms during the same period. Owing to scarcity of money some people were obliged to meet their liabilities by the disposal of a portion of the rugs and carpets used by them fop floor covering. (c) Parsi and Yezdi traders who have established themselves in place of the Hindus, exported a number of c^ipots and tribal rugs. On the whole the position at the end of the year as regards the weaving industry was far from satis factory. Many of the long-established carpet firms have cut down their commitments and the Standard Carpet Co., one of the two nominal British firms, I went into liquidation during the latter part of the j year. The number of looms wording in the prcrvince which at one time stood at 4,000 was reduced to 1,500 in 1930-31, and may be said to have decreased by about 20 per centum during the vear under review. {b) New industries .—Attempts made by the Persian Government last year to revive the silk industryhave not been followed up with any vigour. The quantity of silk produced in the province has never- theless increased slightly. No new industries were started in Kerman during the year under review. (c) Lapse of old industries. —Nil. The shawl industry in Kerman disappeared a good few years ago. (d) Electricity. —Sheikh Abdul Qassim Harandi, the Russian Sales Agent in Kerman, has imported from Russia, through the Soviet Trade Represen tative, machinery for supplying electric light to the town and is at present busy putting up poles and wires under the superintendence of the Russian Engineer who put up the wireless installation in Kerman for the Persian Government in 1926. (e) Demand for foreign machinery. —The proposal to erect a cotton spinning mill at Kerman which had fallen through on Lt.-Colonel Noel’s departure in April 1931, was taken up by the Governor- General of the Province, H. E. Mirza Reza Khan, Afshar, on taking up his post in May 1931. It was decided to form a company with a capital of 403,009 tomans of which the National Bank of Persia and the German firm that was to supply the necessary plant were to subscribe two hundred and fifty thousand tomans. A third of the remaining 250,000 tomans was collected locally and is still lying in deposit at the National Bank. The repre sentative of the latter mentioned firm (Simens Halsker) visited Kerman twice during the year in this connection and it was generally expected that the order for the machinery would be placed in Germany. However, His Majesty’s Consul, in the meantime, furnished the Governor-General with catalogues and estimates from manufacturers of f pinning mill machinery, for the information of the snare-holders of the projected company. It was then found that the quotations received from firms in England were lower by 10 to 15 per cent, than those submitted by the Germans, who had been obliged to increase their original tenders owing to the rise in the rate of exchange since these were submitted. The Governor-General, thereupon, suggested that the Directors of the company send three of their representatives to Tehran for adjudication in the matter by the Minister of Justice. The National Bank of Persia and the German firm introduced by it, it would appear, have now declined to participate in the scheme and the share holders at Kerman have, therefore, to find the remain ing capital, viz., 303,000 tomans themselves, the greater part of which has already been promised. The question of the country from which the required machinery will be ordered, still hangs fire. Whilst the project of importing a spinning mill for Kerman was in progress, local merchants at Yezd were prevailed upon to subscribe although they had agitated for a separate mill in their own town. After the departure of H. E. Mirza Reza Khan, Afshar, it is said, that they have received the necessary permission. (/) Development of Mines, if any.—Nothing further has been done to develop the so-called coal mine near the Badumun hills to the west of Kerman city or the turquoise mine said to exist in the Khana- mum range, referred to in my last report. 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of communications generally. —Kerman is connected by motor roads with Bandar Abbas, the nearest sea port, and with Nok Kundi, via, Zahedan, the present railhead. R gular communication exists with the above two places which are trade forwarding centres for Kerman. There is a bi-weekly postal service to Bandar Abbas and mails to Zahedan go once a week. Kerman is the centre for road administration in South-East Persia, which includes Lingah, Yezd, and Birjand, and Prince I’Zaz-us-Saltaneh, who has held charge of this administration for the past two years, takes an active interest in his work, with the result that the state of communications in the province has improved generally. A new post office was opened at Khabis during the year. (h) Construction of new Roads. —The only new road started during the period under review was the motor alignment between Khabis and Kerman via the Sirch pass, which the road authorities expect to complete by the middle of 1932, though the land-owners are less optimistic of the eventual success of this project. A number of land-owners in Rawar on the Kerman- Meshed caravan route have made the Kerman- Rawar section of this road fit for touring cars, in expectation of receiving support from the Central Government. The road authorities have paid special attention, during the year, to the roads in Persian Baluchistan. (c) Upkeep of old. —The motor road from Bandar Abbas via Sirjan, the principal trade route, was kept in good condition throughout the year. Owing to the connection of the Kerman Zahedan route with the motor road to Iranshahr near Yakilabad, above Bam, the section Kerman to Vakilabad has been constantly repaired and has improved gene rally. The motor road from Kerman to Yezd has also been repaired at various places so that in the majority of cases travellers motor to Yezd from Kerman in one day—a distance of 225 miles. (d) Distances and average rates {summer and winter) on chief trade routes.—Vide Appendix V. (e) Effect of motor on animal transport, rates and turn-over. —Motor lorries have now completely re placed animal transport on such tracks as can be traversed by wheeled traffic, more especially as the hire for motor transport is so low that it does not pay the owners of animals to compete.At the same time owing to the quantity of mer chandise imported into Kerman having decreased considerably rates of hire are low but competition severe. The turn-over is insignificant and many of the vehicles are running at a loss. The facilities for repair of cars are limited and the price of tyres, tubes and spare parts—high on the whole. (/) Air Service—whether used for commercial ser vice. —Three Junkers’ aeroplanes conveying passen gers arrived in Kerman during the year. This air mail service was not used for commercial purposes as far as Kerman is concerned. {g) Security. —Robbers from Ears and Lar still continue their activities on the Bandar Abbas— Kerman motor road but to a considerably less extent owing to the vigilance of the Amnieh autho rities. During the year one post was robbed and two drivers of motor lorries and one passenger were killed. Law and order were on the whole well maintained on the other trade routes in the province. 9. Social. (а) Standard of living. —Owing to adverse economic conditions generally and the slump in the carpet trade there was no improvement in the existing low standard of living. There was, moreover, a smaller demand for labour of every kind. (б) Unemployment. —Owing to the above-men tioned causes unemployment has been on the increase. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. (d) Public health and hygiene. —No steps were taken to improve the sanitation of the town and the same unhealthy practices prevalent 24 years ago still exist. The epidemic of mumps which had broken out at the end of 1930 lasted till the autumn. It was followed in November by a general epidemic of inriuenza which was still raging at the close of the year. Typhus, in a mild form, was discovered in the poorer quarters of the town, early in March and a few cases were under treatment at the time of writing (e) Municipal services. —As the result of the new Municipal taxes introduced during the previous year the actual income of the Baladiyeh Depart ment is now estimated at Tomans 80,000. Never- the less, the roads in the town still remain in their former unsatisfactory condition. The house tax of 3 per cent, estimated on the annual rent, which was to be introduced in March 1931, has not yet been put into force. The metalling of the main arterial road cut through the middle of the town in 1929 and called the Khaya- ban-i-Shahpur was taken in hand at the close of the year. The Municipality have now two Persian Engineers appointed from Tehran. The lighting arrangements in the town have also improved. Endeavours by the Municipality Department to participate in the electric light project, referred to under ‘ INDUSTRY (e) ’ have failed and it will therefore have to pay according to its consumption. 10. Information for Travellers. Kerman can be reached from the United Kingdom by the following routes :— . (1) Via Tehran. —700 miles from Tehran to Ker man. The cost of a single seat in a lorry varies from Tomans 10 to 20, and from Tomans 15 to 30 for a seat in a touring car. The journey in a lorry takes about 7 days, and four in a touring car. (2) Via Bandar Abbas. — (a) Imperial Airways to Lingah or Jask thence by British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly steamers to Bandar Abbas in 6 and 12 hours respectively. A stay of several days is usually entailed at either of these ports. At Jask, the Imperial Airways maintain a rest-house. (b) By the Strick Lines of steamers sailing from England once a month. Duration of voyage about 25 days. (c) By P. and O. to Bombay in 14 days—thence by British India Steam Navigation Company’s weekly steamers taking six to seven days. There is a bi-weekly motor service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and vice versa leaving both places every Monday and Thursday. A seat in the postal lorry costs from 10 to 15 tomans. A private touring car can be hired for from 100 to 120 tomans. (3) Via Noh Kundi. —Three days’ rail from Karachi —thence by touring car or lorry to Zahedan (Duzdab) and from Zahedan to Kerman, in all 468 miles by road ; transit period about 4 days. There is no regular motor traffic on this road hence the rates of hire depend on the type of car required. A touring car could be hired for about 200 tomans. There are no regular hotels in Kerman but accom modation of a sort is available in rest-houses and motor garages where Persian food is available. Telegraph rates. —United Kingdom. Rials. 8-80 per word. India. Rials. 6-30 per word. Parcels. —These must be sent to a clearing agent in Zahedan or Bandar Abbas but a permit to import the contents must first be obtained from the Ministry of Economies at Tehran by application through the various Legations. Transport rates. —Lorries one to three ton and touring cars can be hired at about 10 pence to 1 shilling a mile. G. A. RICHARDSON, His Majesty's Acting Consul, Kerman.3 l.^Cc £0. \ /r Ji-9. J Letter from the Off^» Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1899, dated the 10th September 1931. I have the honour to forward a copy of the Trade Report for Kerman for the year 1930-31 compiled by Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., Acting His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. EHVAOOUKfS IN \ INDIA FOREIGN SECRF.TaKY’U Letter No 21 , ,VL Dated 11 FEB. 1932 Recd.ea 2 S FEB. 1932Trade Report of the Kerman Consular District for the year ending 21 st March 1931. 4* 1. Trade.' 1. (a) General Conditions .—The total value of imports into Kerman for the year under review, given in Appendix I, shows a decrease, as compared with the previous year, of over 2 million Krans. This was in spite of the fall in the value of Krans, vide para. 20 below. 2 . The imports by the Hindu traders during the year amounted to only Krs. 2,719,280, being a decrease of about 1 Krs. 2,128,000 on the previous year’s total; This, apart from the decrease in the import trade in general, was due to two of the five Hindu firms having closed down early in the year. 3. The rise'in the .figure for tea is due to the fact that, in the preceding two years, the import of that article by the Hindu traders only was taken into account. 4. The introduction of the Exchange Control Regulations followed at the latter part of the year by the Forfeign Trade Monopoly Law was the chief cause of the fall in the imports, while contributing to increase the export trade, the total value of which was about 300,000 Krans in excess of that of the previous year. 5. Owing , to the depreciation of the Kran and the difficulty in obtaining exchange for the import of foreign articles, the prices of all foreign goods locally rose considerably, in some cases to as much as 100 per cent, or more, especially those of commodities mostly in demand, such as the cheaper kinds of cotton piece-goods, etc. 6 . The economic condition of the Province was decidedly worse than it had been for many years past and carpet weaving, the only stable industry of Kerman, ceased to pay, on account of the rise in the price of the necessaries of life. The carpet firms, moreover, stopped giving fresh orders and only those weavers who had means of their own or who could borrow at high rates of interest, wer« in a position to carry on. 7. {b) New Items of Trade .—There have been no new items of trade of any importance. Some attempts were made by traders at Bam to export liquorice root to India, but the amount of trade done in this article has so far been negligible. 8 . (c) New Trade Channels .—No new trade channels were made during the year. The Kerman- Bandar Abbas motor road continued to remain the main trade route and its only competitor, the Kerman-Duzdab road, was used even less than before, as no attempt was' made to improve it in any way. (d)' Growth of Foreign Competition and Danger to British Interests Resulting Therefrom .—Russia continues to remain the only dangerous competitor. In spite of the fact of having decreased her commit ments to a considerable extent during the latter half of the year, Russian imports increased bv about 50 per cent., as will be seen from Appendix IV. Her share in the import of kerosine and petrol was one- fourth and oiie-third respectively of that of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, as compared with about one-fifth and one-fourth in the year 1929-30. Her imports of cotton piece-goods were Krans 1,100,000 against Krans 770,000 and 397,000 imported by Great Britain and India respectively while she handled about 50 per cent, of the sugar trade, af the expense of Java and Belgium, as com pared with 25 per cent, in the previous year. 10. Germany’s share of the import trade dropped from 7 to 4 per cent. This was chiefly owing to German synthetic dyes haying lost much of their popularity in so far as their use in the carpet industry is concerned. The fact that these dyes alter very little even by chemical washing in New York seems to make them unsuitable when used in the manufacture of carpets in combination with other dyes, not as fast coloured. The total value of synthetic dyes imported into - Kerman was only about £750. 11. (e) The Russians—Their Trading Methods — Popularity—Success or Failure .—The introduction of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law, detrimental as it is to the import of goods from other foreign countries, promises to be advantageous to Russia, with her system of barter. Early in the year the Bureau Perse advertised in. the local papers the opening of their branches in Kerman, Sirj an, Rafsinjan, Yezd and Bandar Abbas for forwarding goods from and to the last mentioned place. They also offered to ship goods by Soviet vessels to any part of the World from Bandar Abbas. The advantage to Russia in having a competent Trade Representative in Kerman cannot be over rated. 12 . (/) Credit offered by Foreign Firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms .—In cqnsequence of the change in trade conditions brought about by the introduction of the New Trade Monopoly Law and Exchange Control Regulations, the actual credit offered by foreign firms abroad would not appear to be as important as it used to be. Henceforward the only credit inducive to trade would have to be local.2 Up to sometime ago the Hindu traders in Kerman handled the bulk of the foreign import trade because of the extended credit they gave to local shopkeepers. Recently, however, having experienced great reverses in consequence of Russian competition as well as from the restrictions created by the new laws, they have been unable to hold their ground with the result that of the seven Hindu firms doing business in Kerman only three now remain and those have reduced their commitments to a considerable extent. If conditions do not improve these remaining Hindu firms will also have to close down, probably during the next year or two, and then Russia with her Trade Representative on the spot, will be the master of the situation. 13. {g) Popularity of Foreign Goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc .—As regards quality, British goods still hold their own against those of any other country, in spite of the reputation they have of being more expensive. As regards credit, the manufacturer at home, in the majority of cases, does not seem to agree to anything but cash against documents, whereas the German firms, for the most part, would take 20 to 30 per cent, with order and the balance against delivery of goods at the port of entry into Persia. The chief question, however, in future lies in being able to import any goods at all and when once the goods have been imported, those firms will be able to do the greatest business who are in a position to offer local credit. The Hindu traders who did this until recently are going to leave the field to the Russians who allow retailers up to two months' credit and in some cases even more and this will not fail to give the Russians a great advantage. 14. (A) Openings for British Goods .—The chief British goods in demand here are Manchester cotton piece-goods : vit :— (a) Prints, (h) Shirtings and (c) Calico (“ T ” Cloth). In {a) the Russians have succeeded in driving Manchester from the market and they are now handling the bulk of the business in ( 6 ) and (c), in spite of the fact of the Russian products not being nearly as popular as those of Manchester. Another chief item of import is sugar of which Russia is now handling about 50 per cent, of the trade, but here her competition affects Java and Belgium and not Britain although British capital and the British carrying trade are involved inci dentally. 15. India’s chief imports are cotton piece-goods, check cloth and cotton yarn. During the year 1929-30 India’s share of imports in the piece-goods trade amounted to Krans 1,660,000 but this dropped to Krans 397,000 in 1930-31. As regards cotton yarn—an item valued at about one million Krans, there has so far been no competi tion against India, though a scheme has been started to import a mill for spinning yarn from the cotton grown in this Province. In this connection it should be mentioned that the bulk of the cotton yarn, imported into this Province is suspected to be of Japanese origin and re-exported from India. 16. It should be remembered that according t 6 the new laws, the import of foreign goods will only be permitted against the export of Persian products of an equivalent value. The two nominal British firms—The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers HJd., and the Standard Carpet Company Ltd., exi^Tving carpets from Kerman, are not interested in imports nor in the pushing of British trade as such. 17. (i) Overtrading .—With the exception of a few items of import, such as coffee beans and spices, I which show an increase, the amount of the imports has decreased by about two and a quarter million Krans during the year, in spite of the fall in the exchange, and of stocks being steadily exhausted. 18. (j) Commercial Morality.—The local traders do business, for the most part on a small scale and lead a hand to mouth existence. Since the Hindu traders in Kerman have curtailed their commitments and started collecting out standings without extending credit, the local shop keepers find it very hard to meet their obligations. In spite of this, commercial morality has, on the whole, been fair and no bankruptcies worth men tioning have come to light. The Hindu traders themselves have lost about 100 per cent, on the exchange, but as their principals are in India the consequences of these losses do not affect the people actually on the spot. 19. (A) Working of Law Courts in Commercial Cases. —Y T ery few commercial cases are referred to the local law courts and suits that are filed there take a very long time to be settled. The visits of the various commissions of enquiry into the doings of the local officials have not tended to increase their efficiency. 2. Financial. 20. (a) Tightness of Money, etc.—The average selling rates between 22nd March 1930 and 21st March 1931 were :— Krans 62-92=£l and Krans 467-04=Rs. 100. Maximum and minimum rates during the year were Krans 90 and Krans 59J=£1 and Krans 666 and Krans 442£=Rs. 100. 21 . Money has undoubtedly been tight during the period, the stringency increasing as the year advanced. There has been little restriction of Credit on the whole in that the reduction of facilities by one Bank has in a measure been met by increased facilities on the part of the other. The principal factor contributing towards tightness of money was the falling off in the carpet trade. Although the shipments abroad owing to large orders having been placed in the market several years previously,3 A5_ the booking during the year under record showed a marked decrease. The orders for carpet, it might be mentioned, are to a large extent paid for in ad- advance, when the contracts are made. 22 . Taxation is undoubtedly heavy and affects all classes but harvests, despite the depredations of locusts, were fairly adequate. There is reported to b$&lt;l^urplus of grain in the Province, owing to large qualities of wheat having been imported from other Provinces. 23. The new law regarding Exchange was enforced in the Province from the 7th March 1930. The British subjects who have suffered most by the new law are the Indian (Hindu) traders. The local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia advised them in time to buy exchange from the Bank by the contract system whereby they would have been able to obtain Rupees at the contracted rate for at least ten weeks from the date of the contract. They did not take advantage of this advice with the result that shortly afterwards they found themselves unable to obtain any exchange at all from the Banks. The total exchange required by them on account of goods in stock, goods sold on credit and cash in hand amounted to nearly ten lakhs of rupees and, after a good deal of telegraphic correspondence, His Majesty’s Legation were able to obtain exchange for one lakh of rupees in the month of July. Since then all endeavours to obtain exchange for them have failed and though they have been exporting silver and other commodities, the local produce of the Province, they have lost over 50 per cent, of their capital. The result has been that the three Hindu firms have closed their business within the last fifteen months and only two remain who have practically stopped importing any fresh stocks from Bandar Abbas. The local Managers of these two firms are busy collecting their outstandings which they find very difficult to do. These Indian traders who handled 45 per cent, of the Kerman import trade a couple of years ago and 35 per cent, since the establishment of Soviet trade, have been obliged to give up their business solely on account of the exchange difficulties. By exporting local produce the Hindus have been able to convert their Krans into rupees at an average of 25 to 50 per cent, above the fixed control rate. They had to account to their principals in rupees and with the fall in the Kran value their liabilities in rupees have caused them another loss of 25 to 50 per cent. In fact, as the result of the exchange difficulties all import trade now remains in the hands of the Russians or Persian local traders. 24. (b) Evidence of Private Capital Unemployed or held abroad .—There is very little capital un employed and none held abroad. On account of the slump in the carpet business, local dealers have large unsold stocks on their hands, so that a consi derable percentage of the capital is now held up in these goods. 25. The project for the erection of a cotton spinning mill, started by His Majesty’s Consul, is still being followed up and there are more hopeful signs of finding the capital required, locally. 26. (c) Diversion of Capital from trade to other purpose or vice versa. — Nil. 27. (d) Bankruptcies.—No bankruptcies of im portance have taken place during the year. (e) Competition among Local Banks. —The Persian National Bank has gained in influence though not in popularity. A branch of this Bank was opened at Rafsinjan in September, under a Persian Manager, and the question of opening branches at Bam and Sirjan also came under consideration during the latter part of the year, but has been turned down for the present. The Imperial Bank of Persia lost a considerable amount of custom as the result of some of the Hindu firms closing down and others curtailing their com mitments. 3. Taxation. 29. [a) Effect of Purchasing Power. —The introduc tion of the new Municipal taxes has made the burden of taxation heavier and helped to diminish the purchasing power of the inhabitants, particularly in the case of lower classes who are in the majority. 30. (b) Fair or unfair incidence. —Considering the poor economic conditions, the incidence is decidedly unfair especially so far as the poorer classes are concerned. 31. The work of re-assessment of land revenue, which was suspended temporarily in October 1929, has been resumed during the year. It is being assessed generally on a three and a half per centum basis on the produce, where this is favourable to the Government. 32. (c) Interference and obstruction on the part of Tax Collectors. —The revenue authorities remain uncompromising. Genuine cases calling for remis sion and even relief in respect of taxation are not taken up by the authorities through fear of being suspected of corruption. In certain instances, whole villages have been deserted through the Finance authorities pressing for revenue, which could not be paid by the inhabitants, who had become destitute as the result of adverse conditions. In spite of the arrears of revenue thus accruing, circulars are being constantly received from Tehran urging the Finance officials to bestir themselves. 4. Military. 33. (a) Commandeering of Transport. —Owing to a recrudescence of disturbances in Lar in the summer and various robberies on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road in the latter part of the year, there were constant movements of troops from Kerman and motor trans port was commandeered on many occasions. There was, however, less interference with Indian driversas the result, probably, of action taken by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, and the military authorities have been more tactful in settling the hire. 34. (b) Extortions and interjerence with trade and Industry. —The general conduct of the military has greatly improved and very often complaints, of even a trivial nature, by the inhabitants have received attention. The justice authorities have also been given more facilities in dealing with cases brought against the military. 35. (c) Effect of Conscription. —The Conscription authorities were not so strict in their dealings as in the previous two years and enlistment in the army, though still unpopular, is not dreaded as it was before. The recruits have proved to be of a more suitable type and are loath to return to their former humble avocations on the expiry of their term of service. 5. Agriculture. 36. (a) Area under cultivation, more or less. —The area under cultivation appears to be the same as before, i.e., between 300,000 and 400,000 acres. More land was sown with cotton seed, but the area sown with wheat and barley was proportionately less than last year. 37. (b) The Harvests. —Wheat and barley, the two main crops, suffered considerably from the depre dations of locusts which visited the Province nine times between the months of February 1929 and June 1930, the total damage being estimated at about one-third of the total crops. The deficit was, however, more than balanced by the importation of corn from other Provinces, especially from Khurasan, but -the price remained fairly high till the end of the year. The cotton crop was also damaged by these insects to a -certain extent while henna as usual did not suffer. The production of pistachios was good and this commodity commanded an unusually high price owing to the big demand for its export. Almonds were badly damaged by the frost at the end of the prervious year. 38. (c) Introduction of New Crops and New Methods. —The production of both American and Egyptian cotton has been tried in the Province but the result of the experiments is not definitely known and so far the ;bulk of the cotton is raised from local seed. 39. A sample of cotton grown from local seed in the district of Rafsinjan was sent to India for trial, by H. B. M’s Consul, earlyin the year and the result ■was satisfactory. It was proved that, in spite of doubts tothe contrary, the cotton in question yielded yarn df No. 20 count, which is the kind commonly used in the mandfacturing of Kerman carpets. 40. The Tndigo plant is'cultivated in certain ef the warmer districts or the Province. Tn olden days extracts from the qilant were used by docal dyers for obtaining various shades of blue. After the introduction of foreign indigo the cultivation of the indigo plant locally diminished, and only a small amount was cultivated for dyeing hair. A certain quantity of the dried leaves was exported to India last year and attempts were made during the year under review to extend the cultivation of the plant. Unfortunately, however, the crops^were much damaged by the locusts and the out-p^^Ws considerably less than usual. 41. (d) Irrigation. —The old method prevails. Representatives from the Ministry of National Economy, who visited the district of Jiruft in the latter part of the year, studied the possibility of an irrigation scheme in connection with the Halil Rud in Jiruft and prepared reports for presentation to the Ministry. 42. The rainfall in the Province is scanty and was less than usual during the year, as the result of which the water in many ‘ Kanats ’ (the chief source of irrigation) decreased. 43. (e) Extent of Hypothecation. —The condition of the smaller land-owners has not improved and more landed property has to be mortgaged by them to raise money. 6. Opium. 44. The question of opium cultivation and the proper management of its taxation remain chief problems for the Persian Government. All the attempts of the local Monopoly authorities to check smuggling and encourage the use of taxed opium have failed. The total fines collected on account of contraband during the year amounted to only Ts. 3,500. The Monopoly authorities made several attempts, mostly unsuccessful, to induce the indi vidual consumers of opium to buy a regular monthly supply of taxed opium from the'Monopoly godown. Searching of houses of all classes of the inhabitants increased during the latter months of the year. The income of the Finance Department from opium, which in 1929 had fallen from Ts. 15,000 to Ts. 5,000 decreased still further, to Ts. 4,000 (exclud ing fines) during the year under review. The year’s out-put of opium was also considerably less than usual and there was a considerable deficit for local iconsumption which had to be filled up by smueslina from other Provinces. Owing to the disturbance in Ears, however, the amount of smuggling from the Province decreased towards the end of the year and, consequently, prices went up to an extent heretofore unknown. The smokers of the drug, most of whom could not afford to pay such high prices, had a very hard time and there was a great outcry against the Mono poly authorities. Early in the year the Finance Ministry in Tehran were contemplating the intro duction of a bill with theiview of changing the system ^of taxation by fixing a fixed rate on each square xar of land. This would have settled the problem5 ib % to a great extent in so far as smuggling and corrup tion by the local authorities were considered, but the interested parties agitated against the proposed bill, which was eventually shelved for the time being. At the end of the year news was received from Tehran that the Government * were considering another bill for the reduction of the taxes. The price of crude (un-taxed) opium for exportation wasAout Krs. 220 per man (Lbs. 6-875) in the beginning of the year, but the demand diminished as the year progressed and it fell to the unusually low level of Krs. 160 per man. As far as can be seen, the authorities are not so much concerned with the stopping of the drug habit as it is with the checking of smuggling, thereby increasing the Government income. Incidentally, however, the increased activities of the Monopoly Department in the searching of houses, coupled, for the time being, with the scarcity of contraband and the high prices prevailing, have undoubtedly decreased the number of addicts and very few fresh persons now adopt the habit. 7. Industry. 45. (a) Carpets .—As already mentioned in previ ous Trade Reports, Kerman’s only industry is carpet weaving which has so far accounted for about 75 per cent, of the exports. Details of the exports during the year are given in Appendix II, while figures for the preceding three years can be seen in Appendix III. The slight increase in the figures for the year under review, as compared with those for the preceding year, was chiefly due to the fact of small Jewish merchan s having exported large number of cheap tribals to America in anticipation of the new tariff and also of the fall in the value of the Kran that helped the exports to a certain extent. It should be re membered, however, that the Kerman carpet is over a year on the loom and that there is a distinct difference between the state of the market and that of the weaving industry. The situation at the end of the year was serious as the slump in this trade, which had been antici pated for some time, then set in. Many of the carpet firms had cut down their commitments and as orders reached completion in the latter part of the year very few fresh orders were placed. The number of looms working in the Province had fallen from 4,000 to 2,500 and it was feared that in the next few months there would be a decrease by about 50 per cent. The fall in the Kran should have assisted the industry more than it did, but the ill-advised action of the Government in fixing arbitrary rates of exchange made matters worse, as the carpet firms, with their higher standards and traditions, could not like the general merchants, sell their exchange in the open market. Buyers in America, on the other hand, were demanding a reduction in price consonant with the depreciation of the Kran, not realizing perhaps that what is spent on weaving and dyeing carpets in Kerman is only about 20 per cent, of its retail selling price in the States. 46. (b) New Industries.-^Attempts are being made by the Persian Government to revive the silk in dustry which is said to have at one time flourished in the Province. One of the deputies for Kerman, who owes some property in the district of Zerend, has recently brought a few thousand small mulberry plants from the North for cultivation in his estates, with the ultimate object of rearing the caterpillar. 47. The two more cotton spinning plants of American origin have been erected at Rafsinjan, there being now three ginning plants in all working at that town. 48. (c) Electricity .Sheikh Abul Qasim Harandi, the Soviet Sales Agent in Kerman, has taken steps to import an electric plant for Kerman town. Nego tiations in this matter have been going on between him and certain Soviet authorities in Russia, through the Soviet representative in Kerman, but at the end of the year nothing had materialized {see para, below). 49. (d) Demands for Foreign Machinery.—The proposal to erect a cotton spinning mill at Kerman or Rafsinjan mentioned in para. 14 above, was originally made by Lt.-Col. E. W. 0. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., H. B. M.’s Consul, Kerman, and followed up by him during the year, with the view of obtain ing the machinery from a British firm. One of the two alternatives under consideration was the instal lation of a hydro-electric plant at Mahun, for working a cotton mill and providing an electric current for lighting and power to the town of Kerman. At the time of writing this scheme had fallen through owing to Lt.-Col. Noel’s departure from Kerman but it is expected to be taken up by the Persian Government. 50. (e) Owing to the price of charcoal having risen by about 50 per cent, on account of the charcoal supplies having been cut off during the previous winter, and with the view of providing an alternative fuel, His Excellency Purnia, the former Governor General of Kerman, paid a visit to the Badamoo hills to the west of Kerman city and arranged for the coal found there to be extracted. He also proposed to Tehran that all the Government Departments in Kerman should consume coal from this mine. He attached great importance to this coal which he hoped to sell in Kerman at about Krs. 35 a ton. (This mine was visited by a British geological expert in 1913). 51. The same Governor General also came to know of a turquoise mine in the range of Khinaman mountains, to the west of Badamoo hills, and it was said that a sample of the stones sent to Khurasan had been favourably reported on. So far nothing further has been heard about these mines.8. Communications and Security. 52. (a) Roads .—During the year under report no new roads were made and little was done to improve the existing routes. The Bandar Abbas motor road has proved unreliable as the Southern section, which can scarcely boast of a single bridge or culvert, is subject to serious wash-outs in the winter. Moreover the Tang-i-Zagh which had been reported against as an alignment in 1920 by British Engineers is subject to interruption by land slides. 53. As the result of the Shah’s visit in November the question of a settled road policy and programme came to fore. Kerman was made the centre for road administration in South-East Persia which includes ^ ezd, Birjand, and Lingah. The proposed programme is to build a coastal road from Moham- merah to the vicinity of the frontier of British Baluchistan with arterial lines of communication from Bandar Abbas, one to Tehran and the other via Jiruft to Khurasan. The army, however, is in favour of the development of Charbar as a port and the construction of a strategical road to Bampur. The alignment has been surveyed and the cost estimated at Ts. 800,000. Owing to the unsettled condition of the Bandar Abbas Kerman motor road the mails on this section were irregular but no actual robbery of mails took place. The post which is supposed to take 46 hours for the journey in many cases took three weeks in transit. During September the mails from Bandar Abbas were despatched vil Bushire and Isfahan. The Duzdap mail worked satisfactorily on the whole. The bi-weekly service of trains was, however, changed into a weekly one. New post offices were opened during the year at Jiruft and Rudbar. 54. (c) Security .—Law and order have on the whole been well maintained except in the South- West corner of the Province where robbers from bars and Ear have been continually interfering with traffic on the Bandar Abbas motor road. Towards the end of the year there was a recrudescence of Baluch raiding in the Western fringe of the Lut but in the majority of cases the Amnieh intercepted the robbers and forced them to abandon their spoils. It would not appear that this renewal of the former activities has any real political significance. 55. {d) Aviation.—Three flights from Tehran to Kerman of Junker’s planes, carrying passengers, took place during the year under review. No im provement has been made in the aerodrome to the North-West of the town. 9. Social. 56. {a) Standard of Living. —The standard of living, already low in Kerman, has become lower on account of the slump in the carpet trade, a reduced demand for labour of every kind and the high prices prevailing everywhere. 57. (b) Unemployment. —Unemployment has un doubtedly increased owing to the above mei^ioned causes. 58. (c) Emigration. —There is no evidence of any emigration from the Province, though there have been instances of the inhabitants of one district moving into another in search of work. 59. \d) Public Health and Hygiene. —In the month of June the Health Officer received instructions from Tehran to establish quarantine posts against cholera which had appeared in Jallalabad (Afgha nistan). He proceeded to Bam to see if any posts could be established above Bam in the direction of Persian Baluchistan and Sistan but returned without doing anything. There was a few cases of typhoid at Sarasiab, a village 3 miles to the west of Kerman town early in the year ; otherwise the general health of the town has been fair in spite of the extreme poverty of the masses. 60. (e) Municipal Services. —In June the Munici- pality Committee was formed in accordance with the new regulations and set the task of finding new sources of revenues to replace the previous grant from the compounded road taxes fund. It is stated that the new taxes, if carefully collected, will yield from Ts. 40,000 to 50,000 per annum. The members of the Committee, however, complain that, while they are consulted in proposing and levying the taxes, they have no say in their disposal. ^ In addition to the new taxes, a house tax of 3 per cent, calculated on the annual rent is to be levied from the beginning of the next year. This will be over and above the 5 per cent, collected as “ Mustiqilat ” by the Finance Department on houses rented. The whole income on this account will, in future, go to swell the Municipality Chest. 61. The main artery road which was cut through the middle of the town last year, involving the demolition of some 100 houses, was improved during the latter part of the year under the supervision of an engineer from Tehran. Further houses had to be demolished to straighten this road and an allotment of Ts. 20,000 was sanctioned for the work The Baladieh have not yet taken up the question of improving the existing roads through or round the town which are in a miserable condition, although they have slightly improved the lighting of streets.

Consul, Kerman.Letter from the Hon'We the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2115, dated the 13th September 1930, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. I have the honour to forward a copy of the Trade Report for Kerman for the year 1929-30 compiled by His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. ENCLOSURE IN ! INDIA FOREIGN SECP^^’S Latter [152 Dated &lt; DEC. 193(1 ■isceivea 2 2 DEC. 1930—— i— — —I |o3 joS Trade Report of Kerman Consulate District for the year ending * March 20th 1930. 1. Trade. (A) General Conditions. 1. The Province of Kerman (excluding Persian Baluchistan) consists of an area of 70,000 square miles with a population of about 800,000, viz., a little over 11 persons to the square mile as compared to a figure of 19 for all Persia. The imports for the whole of Persia amount to about 28/— a head whereas in the Kerman Province the figure is not more than 10 /-—, which confirms the traditional poverty of the Province as a whole. The Province has three trade outlets, viz., via the Persian Gulf Port of Bandar Abbas, the Duzdab Railway and the motor road to Tehran. The proportion in which these routes are used may be stated as being approximately as follows :— — Bandar Abbas.* Duzdab. Tehran. Imports Per cent. 70 Per cent. 10 Per cent. 20 Exports 80 10 10 * About 43 per cent, of the Bandar Abbas imports find their way to the Kerman Province. This large area of 70,000 square miles has not more than 1,000 miles of tracks used by wheeled transports and about 800 miles of telegraph line. It is cut up by lofty mountain ranges ; the administration out side the few towns is nebulous ; Statistics of trade and revenue are few and inaccurate and even where existing are difficult to come by. The figures for this report could only be obtained for the town of Kerman and surrounding districts up to a radius of say 100 to 150 miles. The area involved is roughly 10,000 square miles with a population of about 230,000. However apart from the factor of the availability of statistics it is convenient to divide the Province into the two above divisions because the district of Kerman as opposed to the Province produces 75 per cent, of the total exports of which the bulk is represented by carpets. The rest of the Province exports a few tribal rugs and little else but participates in the purchasing power of the trade in Kerman carpets by its contribution of wool, dyes and foodstuff for the weavers. The following rough figures will illustrate the posi tion :— Value of Value of — imports per exports per head. head. Kerman District 20/— 22/— Rest of Province 61- 4/— In the case of Kerman district with its 4,000 looms each employing an average of about 8 persons the general figures of density of population exports and imports compare favourably with the all Persia figures. — Population per square mile. Imports per head. Exports per head. All Persia 19 28/— 20/—* Kerman District . 25 20/— 22/— * Excluding oil. These figures would seem to show that the town of Kerman and the surrounding district does not share in the traditional poverty connected with the word “ Kerman.” However, this reputation can still be explained by the improvidence of the people who never put a penny into productive enterprise ; to their proverbial laziness and refusal to work beyond the limit of subsistence ; to their addiction to opium ; to the prevalence of venereal disease. The most striking feature of the figures for the Kerman district is the excess of exports over imports as compared to the all Persia figures where the posi tion is reversed. This excess is due to the following factors :— 1. The value of the carpets exported includes a certain proportion of overhead expenses and interest on capital which are not spent in Persia. 2. The carpet weavers are not self supporting but draw from outside for foodstuff as well as tobacco, opium and certain Euro pean luxuries. 3. Yarn and dyes used in carpet manufacture are imported from abroad and wool from the outlying parts of the Province.2 The P/ovince is undoubtedly potentially wealthy but nothing has been done in the way of develop ment and the only industry, the weaving of carpets, seems incapable of much expansion. The number of looms existing now is not much greater than it was 20 years ago, and in consequence the consumption of foreign goods is more or less stationary. Carpets by weight are a valuable product (about £500 a ton) whereas the average weight of imports is not more than £ 80 a ton. This results in an absence of return loads to the ports and a high rate of freight to the interior. Freight from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is £16 a ton as compared to £3-5-0 for the return journey. (B) Imports. The figures of imports are given in Appendix I and show a total of 11 million Krans, which converted at the average selling rate for the year, viz., 56 Krans, equals £196,000. This figure does not, however, include all imports into Kerman town .There are others, chiefly luxuries imported in small consignments from Tehran. There are also imports direct to towns of the Province such as Rafsinjan, Sirjan, and Bam. It is difficult to estimate their value. £35,000 is rough approxima tion. This brings the total value of imports into Kerman and the surrounding districts to £230,000. There is no doubt that imports this year have fallen but it is difficult tj estimate the exact amount. The best index is that given by the import figures of the five British Indian firms which show a 16 per cent, reduction, i.e., from £150,600 to £125,000. However, Russian trade advanced and the net loss was probably not more than £ 10,000 to £15,000. As regards individual items of import the varia tions shown in the figures for the last four years given in Appendix I, are not of much value as the merchants especially the Indians import in a hapha zard manner and generally either hold large stocks or are short of some commodity. In regard to the following items, however, com ment can be offered :— 1. Piece-goods. The Russians have captured the whole trade in prints valued at £15,000 a year. The origin of other categories is as follows :— — United Kingdom. India. Russia. £ £ £ T. Cloth (Calico) . 4,000 2,000 Shirtings 2,800 2,400 Misslins 1,400 lied Tw ills . 1,300 Black Italians 2,400 . , 2,800 (Cheque Cloth (Shatranji) # , 17,800 # ^ Fastoomi 4,800 Black TwiU . 2,400 Calico Nashoor 1,200 &gt;iim &gt;laboot. •• •• 1,500 2. Cotton Yarn. There is reason to believe that a considerable pro portion of the yarn is of Japanese origin although shown as coming from India. 3. Petrol. The 100 per cent, increase over the average of previous three years is due to the opening of ^3 motor road to Bandar Abbas. Russian petrol is preferred to Anglo-Persian Oil Company but the reverse is the case in regard to Kerosene. 4. Sugar. Owing to the partial curtailment of smuggling from the South West corner of the Province the figures show an increase. 5. Woollen goods. The very large increase is entirely due to the new ; dress regulations. (C) Exports. These are shown in Appendices II and III. Carpets are treated separately under the heading of Industry. 1. Cotton. All goes to Russia. Bp to a few years ago it was possible to export Kerman cotton although hand ginned to Bombay but with the labour troubles in India and the trade depression it can no longer be done. The first power gin has been installed at / Rafsinjan and the owner says that the ginned cotton j produced can almost be exported profitably to Bombay but that it pays better to send it to Russia. Machine ginned cotton sells at Rafsinjan at Rs. 170 per candy of 784 lbs. Transport to Bombay is about Rs. 35 per candy. The other items of export depend on weather, pests and other factors influencing output. (D) New items of Trade. None worthy of mention. (E) New trade channels. As already pointed in para. A ( 1 ) the main trade / channel is through Bandar Abbas and it has gained in favour by the construction of the new motor road from Kerman to the Coast. The only competitor to Bandar Abbas is Duzdab but it suffers from the difficulty &lt;f the bad road from Kerman and the (studied) re.usil of the Per sian Government to spend a penny, on its improve ments. Moreover Duzdab is predominatingly Indian (Sikhs and Punjabi Mohammadens) and merchants in the interior have few business connections with it and prefer to use Bandar Abbas. Duzdab’s only3 advantage, viz., the absence of Indian Customs is not a factor of much importance as Kerman carpets and other exports have little or no sale in India. It must also be remembered that the bulk of the wealth and population is concentrated on the West and South West sides of the Province where it is more conveniently placed to Bandar Abbas than to l^gdab. (F) Growth of Foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. fl The only dangerous competitor is Russia. Ger- • many is just holding her own with about 7 per cent. I of the import trade. Russia has increased her share from 1 per cent, in 1926 to 35 per cent. British trade has dropped from 50 per cent, to 40 per cent, in the last four years. Cotton goods and yarn 40 per cent., Sugar 20 per cent., Oil Products 10 per cent., represents 70 per cent, of the imports. As regards sugar British capi tal is only involved in distribution. In the other two items Russian competition is being increasingly felt and has captured 40 per cent, of the piece-goods trade at the expense of the United Kingdom and India and 25 per cent, of the sugar trade at the ex pense of Java and Belgium. (Cr) The Russians—Their Trading methods — Popu larity—Success or failure. The Russian method is to establish a reputation for price cutting. Before a consignment of their goods is expected extravagant rumours are spread regarding the quantity and the price reduction. Other merchants are thus frightened into unloading their stock at reduced prices with the result that the Russian goods appear in a depleted market and can be sold at an enhanced figure. The system of barter so unpopular in the North is not in force here as the Russians pay cash for such cotton, hennah, pistachios, etc., as they export. However, their methods above described are un popular with the bigger merchants as upsetting markets and dislocating trade. They dispose of their goods entirely to a Persian Sales Agent, who sells to small retailers on a cash basis but for bigger purchasers gives either a cash discount up to 9 per cent., or credit for periods of one to three months. (Fj) Credits offered by Foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms. British firms for the most part require cash against documents whereas German firms demand only 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, with order and the balance against delivery of goods at the port of entry. The Russian terms have already been referred to in the preceding paragrah. (7) Opening for British trade. The importers of British goods are mainly the five Hindu Firms, who handle 40 per cent, of the import trade. They are, however, poor agents for pushing British trade, being old fashioned and set in their methods. They are but representatives of firms in India and must take such goods as their principals see fit to send them. A further defect of the Hindu firms is that they are not in the least interested in exports although it is clear that with out development of exports the import trade cannot be expected to expand. They are of course not interested in purchasing British goods as such and it is impossible to put them in direct touch with manu facturers at home. They are rapidly losing ground to Russia. A few years ago, they handled 75 per cent, of the import trade but their share is now re duced to 40 per cent. Two of the same firms had to close down this year leaving only five. The break in the exchange has hit them badly and it is probable that some of the remaining firms will also have to shut up shop. The only reason that they are enabled to hold on at all is the extended credit they give which no other traders are prepared to grant. Russia is in the favoured position of having a com petent European representative who can study the market and embark on considered plan of imports. It would seem that if British trade is to hold its own against Foreign competition it must be placed on a level with Russia by having a single importing firm with an Englishman as Manager, who could study the export as well as the import side of the market. It will probaly be objected that British firms established in Persia are not so enamoured with the progress of branches already opened that they should contemplate opening up new ones. This may be so but it does not alter the fact that the present repre sentatives of British trade must continue to lose ground to Russia and that the only solution to save the rot is for a competent British firm to open a branch here. There is no record that the proposi tion has ever been seriously considered by any British firm. “ Prima facie ** there would seem some favourable factors. The carpet trade is chiefly in the hands of a number of European firms, who im port annually dyes to the value of £ 12,000 and cotton Yarn from £13,000 to £15,000. There are a number of commodities such as copper, iron, tin, glass panes, etc., which are at present imported in a spasmodic haphazard manner with the result that stocks be come exhausted and price soars up. Many articles are imported from Europe through India which involves unnecessary handling charges. Copper quoted in the European market at £67-10-0 a ton is sold wholesale at Kerman at £125 whereas the freight charges and customs should not be more than £25 a ton. There are in addition side lines which offer considerable promise. For example there should be an opening for irrigation pumps*. No Persian will be ready to invest in a pump till he has had an ocular demonstration of its capabilities. There should also be a market for a simple form of plough such for example as the Shanti designed * See demand for foreign machinery.4 especially for use by the Indian Ryot. One of them was recently imported for the Consulate and attracted a good deal of attention. To exploit all these lines a European firm with an English Manager is re quired. In this connection it may be remembered that general motors have only captured the Persian market by having reliable agents, who sell on the instalment systems. (J) Commercial morality. The previous good standard has been maintained. (K) Overtrading. The break in the exchange has frightened traders who have started in calling in their outstandings and curtailing their imports. (L) Working of Law Courts in Commercial cases. British firms have not had much recourse to the Courts as it is generally found more satisfactory to compromise out of court, although it may involve some loss of undoubted rights. Justice in the Courts is dilatory and uncertain. 2. Financial. (A) Tightness of money. Average selling rates 22nd March 1929 to 21st March 1930 were :— Krans = £1 = 55-94. Krans = Rs. 100 = 425-07. Minimum and Maximum Rates during the same period were :— Krans 51 and 69£ to £1. Krans 385 and 520 to Rs. 100. In the early period of the year money was not unusually tight in Kerman. Apart from the fact that the carpet trade maintained for some months quite a fair measure of activity there was additional money put in circulation by the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Limited, through the building and installation of their Carding Mill, and the opening of a branch of the National Bank acted in case of credit as, although they advanced little themselves, the Imperial Bank of Persia did not call advances quite so thoroughly and quickly as they otherwise would have done last autumn. The steady and continuous rise in exchange rates «n the depreciation of silver which coincided with a strong demand for exchange in the North was suffi cient to neutralise in great measure the fall of carpet prices in America and elsewhere. It must be realised, however, that the “ lag ” in Kerman is greater than in other carpet centres owing to the fact that a very large proportion of the goods exported is manufactured to specification and, being generally of a finer quality than the goods produced in other centres, remains longer on the looms. With the European New Year, however, the cumu lative effect of American and European depression became obvious and there set in a reduction in the activity hitherto existing. Renewal orders w ere not placed, or only on a smaller scale, so that less money was put in circulation by the export trade and this coupled with the closure of roads by snow and flood induced increasing tightness all round. The exchange restrictions were only institi^i 1 shortly before the close of the Persian year and it is therefore difficult to write precisely of their effects. It seems clear, however, that they can only react adversely on the commerce of this place and aggra vate a situation which has already rendered curtail ment of banking accommodation desirable. {B) Evidence of Private capital unemployed or held abroad. There is no capital held abroad and practically none invested locally outside carpet weaving, agri culture and irrigation. A project for erecting a cotton spinning Mill at Rafsinjan is being considered but, under the present slump condition, it is doubtful whether the capital can be found locally. The largest field for the investment of private capital is in connection with the maintenance of irrigation works (see Agricultural Section). (C) Diversion of Capital from Trade to other purposes or vice versa. Nil. (D) Bankruptcies. No important bankruptcies took place during the year. [E) Competition among Local Banks. A Branch of the National Bank was opened at Kerman in September. This event was not proved so important as anticipated. Extremely competi tive rates were quoted but the business captured was mainly that for which the Imperial Bank of Persia were not prepared to quote. 3. Taxation. {¥) Effect on purchasing Power. The province is poorer than others with the result that the burden of taxation presses more heavily upon it. (G) Fair or unfair incidence. The incidence in itself cannot be described as un fair but owing to the peculiar conditions existing in the country the landlord by some means or other id generally able to shift a portion of his load to the peasant however indirectly. On the other hand the assessment on villages is very uneven. The re assessment of land revenue which had been func tioning since 1928 was closed down in October 19295 after completing but a small proportion of its work. The land tax is the main source of revenue and its incidence is roughly Rs. 2-8-0 per acre as compared with the Indian figure of Rs. 2. This increase is magnified by the inelasticity of the Revenue System which does not make sufficient remission for calami ties, and the fact that no portion of the land revenue ised in assisting agriculture. (I) Interference and obstruction on part of Tax Collec tors. The Revenue Department although greatly im proved is still lacking in many essentials. Its chief fault at present is a lack of elasticity and inability t© grant reasonable relief when required. 4. Military. (J) Commandeering of Transport. Owing to the rebellion in the summer motor transport was commandeered on several occasions. The defect of the present system of requisitioning are the following :— (1) Haphazard methods resulting in an unfair incidence. Indian drivers complain that there is dis crimination against them as their lorries are generally in better conditions than those owned by Persians. (2) A. flat rate per lorry is laid down whereas it should be in accordance with the capa- city. (3) Lories are overladen and overdriven. (4) Sufficient time is not allowed for making repairs, filling up with water, etc. ( 5 ) No allowance is given for detentions. (K) Extortions and interference with, Trade and Industry. The general conduct of the Military has greatly improved. Such malpractices as still exist are of generally a minor character. (L) Effects of Conscription. The general results are undoubtedly beneficial. 5. Agriculture. (M) Area under Cultivation. No estimate is available. A rough approximation may be arrived at by the following figures :— (1) Revenue demand Krs. 3,000,000. Average demand per acre Krs. 10 (compare with Indian figure of Rs. 2 or Krs. 4). Average paying revenue =300,000 acres. (2) Population of Province 800,000. Assume J acre per head of population (compare with all Indian figure of acres). Area under cultivation 400,000 acres. (3) Wheat production 60,000 tons. Barley production 30,000 tons. 60,000 tons at 1,000 lbs. an acre *=133,000 acres. 30,000 tons at 1,200 lbs. an acre *=110,000 acres. Summer crops and gardens 150,000 acres. Taking the mean of the above figures the culti vated area may be put at somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 acres, or -8 per cent, of the area. The Harvest. —The main crops are :— Wheat and Barley. —Sown roughly in the propor tion of 2 to 1 . Cotton. —Grown chiefly at Rafsinjan. Annual production estimated at about 3,000 tons of raw cotton, from an acreage of 3,500. Hennah. —Grown chiefly at Bam. Acreage about 1,000. Average yearly outturn 1,100 tons. Pistachios. —Grown chiefly at Rafsinjan and Sirjan. Acreage about 1,500 acres. Aver age yield 320 tons yer year, of which about 240 tons is exported. Almonds. —Grown mainly in the hill stations throughout the Province. Average about 1,400 acres. Annual outturn about 300 tons, of which about 235 tons is exported. 6. Introduction of New Crops and New methods. Sanction for an experimental farm at Kerman has been received and trials of American and Egyptian cottons are contemplated. Irrigation. In the district of Jiruft there is ample water in the Halil Rud much of which runs to waste in the spring. The possibilities of irrigation schemes in this district has been referred to in more detail in the report of the Commercial Mission to South East Persia in 1904-05. Most of the irrigation of the Kerman Province is carried out by Kanats (under ground channels) of which there are some 10,000 miles in the Kerman district alone. It is calculated that £15 per annum per mile are spent on maintaining these Kanats, i.e., £150,000 a year. The present primitive methods are wasteful, slow and inefficient. It is a simple engi neering problem and any person that would be pre pared to tackle it could be assured of a steady open ing for its activities. Water is extraordinarily valuable. It is calculated that the cost of watering an acre at Kerman is twenty time the canal rate in India. 7. Hypothecation of land. In the Trade Report of 1927-28 it was stated that the amount of land hypothecated is not unduly * Wheat and barley are invariably grown on irrigated land./ 6 large. Since then owing to drought and locusts and the rise in the cost of living many of the smaller land-owners have been compelled to raise money by mortgage. More than half of the land of this Province is in the hands of a few landlords who do not, however, make use of their wealth and resources to improve their land or introduce new crops and methods. Opium. There has been a considerable recent decrease in the opium cultivation of the whole Province due to poor crops, the waning of the smoking habit. In this note, however, the average of the last few years will be considered. The area under cultivation is about 2,750 acres producing 55,000 lbs. of crude opium a year. 20,000 lbs. are handed over to the Excise authorities and paid for at 10 /— a lb. while the balance, i.e., 35,000 is sold as contraband at 26/— a lb. The production of opium is to a great extent governed by the internal demand. As, however, the growers of opium find that as a matter of prac tical politics they have to hand in to Government a quarter of their crops and as the consumer will not pay £5 for banderole opium, when he can buy con traband at 26/— a lb., the balance of opium required for internal consumption, viz., 20,000 lbs. is smuggled in from adjoining provinces. Of the 20,000 lbs. in the hands of the Excise authorities it is only possible to sell about 10 per cent, to the public at the monoply price and this only by a curious compromise with the retail vendors, who in return for being left alone by the authorities in the sale of contraband opium agree to take over this small dolop of Excise opium. The balance of the 20,000 lbs. is sent by the Excise to other Pro vinces chiefly to Shiraz and Ispahan where it is ex ported to China and other consuming countries. 8. Industry. Kerman’s only industry is carpet weaving which accounts for 75 per cent, of exports. There are 1,500 looms in the town itself and 2,750 in the sur rounding districts. In Kerman 20 per cent, of the population are weavers and if the industry died the town would die with it. The total export of carpets for the whole of Persia is about 17,000,000 square feet valued at 3/—a square foot. Kerman exports every year 500,000 square feet of fine quality carpets valued at 6 /— a square foot and 200,000 square feet of tribal rugs valued at 1/6 a square foot.* Sixty per cent, of the outturn is sold in America. Before the war the value of Kerman carpets ex ported per annum was about 8 £ million Krans. It rose to 13£ million in the boom year of 1924. Since * Another 30,000 square fe.t of tribal rugs are sold outside Kerman. then it has slowly declined with certain fluctuations to its present level of 11£ million Krans. As the value of carpets is now about 30 per cent, above the^ pre-war figure, it may be said that the outturn is roughly the same. The foreign demand for carpets is now very slack : in America owing to the Wall Street crash ; in Europe due to trade depression and the unloading of large quantities of carpets nation alized by the Soviet. In America the machine vnttk' carpet known as the Domestic is being producecPrfi ever increasing quantities. There is no competition between it and the good Oriental carpet, as they cater for separate markets. However, there is strong competition with the cheaper Oriental rug such as the tribal. To protect the Domestic, it was proposed to introduce a new tariff of 50 cents a square foot or 55 per cent, ad valorem whichever was most. This would shut out the cheaper form of carpet costing about 50 cents a foot as the duty would then be about 100 per cent, ad valorem. In anticipation of the new tariff small Jewish merchants exported large numbers of cheap tribal rugs to America. Owing to the prohibition issue the new tariff bill made no progress ; the anticipated rise in the value of tribal rugs did not take place, and the small exporters being in need of cash had to dispose of their stocks at a great sacrifice. The Kerman carpet being one of the finest of Persian products, is not subject to ordinary consi deration of economy in manufacture. The larger firms have set their force against the use of machine spun wool arguing that it would be bad policy to detract in any way from the special characteristics of the Kerman carpet one of which is certain irre gularity due to handspun wool. On the other hand there is no doubt that Australian wool offers consi derable advantages in the way of sheen, strength and ability to take the dye. Persian wool is very uneven in quality and colour, while faults are aggra vated by inferior gradings. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company, the largest of the foreign carpet firms, has installed a power plant for carding local wool, which is then spun by hand by women in the same factory building. It is found that machine carded wool is of improved quality and takes the dye better. There is certainly a good opening for scientific sheep breeding with a view to improv ing the quality of the clip. During the last two years the price of wool has steadily risen by 40 per cent, and now stands at 2/5 a lb. for yarn. The following is an analysis of the component costs of a typical Kermani rug, viz., from its being put in the loom to being sold in America. It will be seen that of the price paid by the American cus tomers only 20 per cent, remains in Persian pockets. The 55 per cent, duty is 15 per cent, of the retail price and certain other damages must of course be excluded but in regard to the balance there is un doubtedly a feeling growing that the Persian carpet trade should be reserved to Persian Nationals. Eighty per cent, of the trade in carpets is in the hands7 ef foreign firms. In 1908 the whole of the business was in Persian hands. Material and Labour commission, etc. Quan tity and rate. Cost.

The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers have erected a wool carding factory at Kerman. A cotton ginning plant of American origin has been erected at Rafsinjan with an output of one ton a day. The ginned cotton is said to fetch a better price at Bombay than hand ginned cotton. Demand for foreign Machinery. Spimiing Machinery. There is a proposal on foot to erect a cotton mill at Kerman or Rafsinjan. The proposal is still in embryo but the situation is being watched and the proposition will be put up to British firms as soon as further data are available. Electricity. In the Kerman Province there are at present only two power plants (both installed in 1929)—One a 10 H.P. oil engine at Rafsinjan for running a cotton gin and the other a 22 H.P. Ruston Hornby engine at Kerman for carding cotton. Both also generate current for local use. There is undoubtedly a consi derable opening for power plants and electric light installation but without some active interest by the firm, who could supply the machinery, it is difficult i to make any progress. In this respect the Russians J are in a much stronger position. They are actively ; interested in supplying electric light for Kerman and f have had an engineer here to go into the matter and • frame provisional estimates. For the moment the f Governor-General has intervened and is endeavour ing to persuade the Russians to generate current using as fuel a low grade coal about 15 miles from &lt; Kerman. Demand for foreign Machinery. Among the demands for foriegn machinery may be cited the following :— Spinning Machinery. Persia imports every year about 2,500 tons of yarn (95 per cent. No. 20). A number of Persian mer chants are considering the possibility of establishing milling machinery to spin about 500 tons of yarn a year from the locally grown cotton. Pumping Machinery. Water for irrigation is very valuable. In the neighbourhood of Kerman water is found in wells at about 55 feet depth and raised by bullocks working a Persian wheel. In an average well million gallons a year is raised at a cost of about £100 sufficient to irrigate 3£ acres. It would seem that water could be raised by a mechanical pump at a considerably cheaper rate. Mines. There is evidence of considerable mineral wealth in the Kerman Province. However, the somewhat cursory examination by geologists in the past have yielded only negative results, except as regard to copper. Among the mineral deposits which are known to exist may be cited the following :— Asbestos. Mica. Turquoises. Coal. Copper. Copper at present offers the most promising field. The mines on the Bahr-i-Asman range were examined by a British engineer on behalf of the Kerman mining syndicate in 1921, who reported that they could be worked probably only a small European party with a capital of £5,000. The best specimens of ore gave a percentage of copper of 19-3 per cent. The mines were again examined by a party of German engineers in 1927, who reported that the deposits justified a full scale exploitation. Their analysis of ore speci mens gave approximately the same results as those obtained in 1921.9. Roads. Communications and Transport. The Kerman Bandar Abbas Road (340 miles) was completed in the spring of 1929. According to Persian standard it may be said to be good. A Ford tourer has been through in 24 hours and the road is generally used by lorries of up to 3 tons capacity.* The other two main roads in the Province are : 1. Kerman to Yezd. 2. Kerman to Duzdab. Both are unmettailed tracks often impassable after heavy rain, but the first is being slowly improved. The other, however, is being purposely neglected by the Persian Government, who prefer, for political reasons, to develop the Bandar Abbas route. On the other hand the Government is credited with a desire to build a military road to Baluchistan, which will leave the Duzdab road on the other side of Bam and continue vid Rigan and Iranshahr. No serious work has as yet been done on this road but on the section to Bam a great improvement has been effected by realigning the Kerman Mahun road (21 miles) along the foothills so as to avoid the shifting sands on the plain. There are no further developments in regard to the proposed road to Khabis but the property owners in that town are pursuing the matter and are ready to contribute a considerable sum (£ 2,000 is mentioned). In addition to the roads already men tioned, there are a large number of tracks along which lorries can ply. The terrain and soil lend themselves to road constructions and a number of landlords have connected up their estates by motor track at an expenditure of a few shillings a mile. Among the towns which can be reached by car from Kerman are :— Zerend. Rawar. Baft. Ravin. Rates. These vary greatly owing to factors of weather, surface, security, cargo, ofiering, etc. Another im portant factor is the size of the lorry for which a road is passable. At present the Bandar Abbas and Duzdab roads are not negotiable by vehicles of over 3 tons capacity, and even so with difficulty, so that 1 1 ton vehicles are most in evidence. The following table shows the average maximum rates per ton mile :— — Upward. Downward. Minimum. Maximum. Minimum. Maximum. 9. d. 9. d. 9. d. 8. d. Kerman-Bandar Abbas 0 10 2 4 0 3 0 10 Kerman- Duzdab 0 10 2 4 0 9 1 6 Kerman-Yezd 0 9 1 0 0 9 1 0 * The Persian authorities are talking of restricting the tra- ffi« to lorries of a maximum capacity of 14 tons. Taking into consideration the bad roads, low return freight, and in some cases, absence of cargo, comparative high cost of petrol ( 2 s. 6 d. a gallon at Kerman) the above rates are as a whole scarcely economical and it is difficult to see how they can be maintained at such unremunerative levels. Already some lorry owners are unable to meet instalments due on the hire purchase system and are returning loo^s to agents. Rates must in time find, an econc^F? equilibrium. Security. Owing to rebellion the roads, with the exception of the Kerman-Duzdab road, were insecure during the summer months. With the collapse of the rebel lion in the autumn security was re-established and has remained on the whole good. Animal transport. Rates by animal transport are generally about 25 per cent, below those by motor transport. In the case of down rates which, owing to lack of cargo offering, have sunk to a very low level, it is cheaper for animal transport to travel unladen. The mule as a beast of burden has practically disappeared, being replaced by the donkey and the camel. Information for Travellers. Kerman can be reached by the following routes :— 1. Bandar Abbas.

E. W. C. NOEL, Major, I.A., His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman.r v 1 7 OCT 1929 Letter from the Hon’Me the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1698, dated the 22nd July 1929. , to forward a copy of the Trade Report for Kerman for the year 1928-29 compiled by Hia Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. 3Trade Report of Kerman Consulate District for the year ending March 20th, 1929. 1. (a) General conditions .—The total imports into Kerman town for the year 1928-29, compared with previous three years, are given in Appendix I. The total export of carpets, showing route and destination, is given in Appendix II, while Appendix III gives the total exports from the province, including, besides carpets, all other items of importance from Kerman and three other main centres of trade (Bam, Sirjan and Rafsinjan) as compared with figures for the pre vious three years. 2 . Throughout the year under review trade conti nued on the whole to be dull and, with the exception of piece-goods, the total volume of trade was even less than the last year’s figures, when trade was also considered to be slack. The total import of piece-goods rose from 1,088 to 4,024 thousand krans, but this was not due to any exceptional demand in this line, but because the Hindu traders, who deal in this class of goods for the most part, had consumed all their old stocks and their imports are not actually supposed to suffice for one ear’s consumption only. In fact they have large alances on hand at this moment from the above stocks which included English piece-goods to the value of 2,132 as compared with 296 thousand krans in 1927-28. Practically all the British trade in prints has gone to Russia whose imports increased from 200 to 500 thousand krans. 3. There have been practically no imports during the year in glass, chinaware and lamps from the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe, as large stocks have accumulated here from previous years, and the purchasing power of the masses has also greatly decreased. This year, for the first time after the war, Russia imported 15,000 krans worth of glass and chinaware. 4. The import of cotton yarn, which was 770 thousand krans last year, dropped to 207 this year, against 277 in 1925-26 and 240 in 1926-27. The .exceptional increase in 1927-28 was due to stocks for Yezd being imported through Kerman, which practice again has been stopped. 5. In spite of matches being now produced in Persia the foreign trade in this article has not de creased. 6 . Imports in sugar dropped from the total figure of 2,831 to 1,976 thousand krans and this is largely due to smuggled sugar coming in from Lar to Kerman via Sirjan. It seems that about 2,500 bales of contra band sugar reached Sirjan in 1928-29. 7. The import of tea dropped from 731 to 131 thousand krans, but it seems that in 1926-27 and 1927- 28 unusually large imports were made and there weie thus great stocks left from previous years. 8 . The large decrease in the import of woollen goods from 80 to 28 thousand krans, is due to large stocks of these goods having been purchased from Tehran, vide paragraph 10 below. 9. On the whole the economic condition of the province appears to be much the same, if not worse than it has been for the last 3 or 4 years. There has been no real prosperity. The application of conscrip tion to Kerman has been a disturbing factor in the stable industry (carpets) of late and through that has had repercussions of a detrimental character on retail business. High food prices arising from poor crops have exercised pressure for a considerable period and trade cannot be described as having been good, though no important failures have been reported. 10 . High Customs dues and road taxes seem to have acted in restraint of imports from abroad to a certain extent and haberdashery and woollen goods have for some time largely been bought in Tehran (where stocks have become excessive and were therefore being disposed of at prices favourable to the buyers) aided by the recent enforcement of the adoption of the Pehlevi hat and a more or less Europeanised style of clothing, which created a new demand. 11. (a) The principal influence detrimental to trade, however, appears to be Russian competition, or more* particularly the methods employed in applying such. With a relatively small quantity of goods and a great deal of talk and propaganda, and of course low prices, an effect of instability of prices is produced quite out of proportion to the actual quantity and value of goods disposed of. The effect of this is to make merchants tend to hold up orders, in anticipation of the arrival of the shipments promised by Russian Trade re presentatives. ( 6 ) The opium habit causes laziness, thriftlessness and contentment with low standards of living, hence lack of demand and consequent high prices for imported goods. 12. (5) New items of trade and new trade routes. There has been little new trade of importance except that the Russian prints have practically driven Manchester prints off the market. As in last vear 80,000 krans worth of piece-goods were imported from Ispahan by the local merchants, besides the direct imports, vide concluding portion of paragraph 2 above. 13. No new trade routes have been opened. The volume of traffic on the Duzdap road was more this year than the year before owing to the increase in exports by the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd.2 14. (c) Growth of foreign competition. —The chief foreign articles competing with British goods are Russian piece-goods, oil and sugar, Japanese piece- goods, Germpp .dyes ami American ; ipotor oars. 15. The competition of Russian sugar is with the Indian trade though, no doubt, the English (jarryj^g trade is also affected. Non-Russian imports come from Java or Belgium, mostly via India. 16. Total Russian imports of kerosene and petrel dpring the year was Batmans ■ Kerosene ..... 65,000 Petrol ...... 1,300 which, on the whole, worked out as £th of the quantity imported by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 17. In piecegoods, on the other hand, the Russians have made considerable progress, their imports in prints having increased by 250%. They sell prints of good quality and design at a price with which Manchester cannot compete, and this Russian stuff is now greatly affecting.the sale of Indian check cloth which has had a good market in Kerman so far. Japanese piece-goods also compete with the Indian stuff. Italian thin cotton material, with artificial silk designs, formerly imported direct, are now obtain ed through Tehran. 18. German dyes continue to have it all their own way. Their imports increase gradually and there are no signs of an effort by the British dye industry to compete in this line. 19. The sale of motor cars and rubber goods have increased a good deal. America has the monopoly of this trade for reasons already known. 20. (d) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, eic.—The quality and price of competitive piece-goods have already been dealt with. Russian sugar is inferior to the sugar imported via India.aud there is litfle difference in price. Rus sian oil and petrol are sold at the same price as the A. P. O. C. products. In respect of credits, however, the Russians allow retailers up to ,2 months’ credit, which gives them a .great advantage. German firms take 20 or 30%.with the order apd the balance against delivery of goods at port of entry into Persia. British firms, -for tfie iBQSt patt,, require cash against docu ments and only in few gases 4 f aw usuance sight drafts against acceptance of bills. 21. (e) British trade. —The reason for the appre ciable reduction in the imports of woollen goods has already been stated. In fact it is difimplt to induce Persian traders to import British goods direct from the United Kingdom as the import trade in Kermap is mainly in the hapds of the British-Indiftns who work on a system of granting credit to retailers with payment by instalments, with which it would be extremely inadvisable for any European fi$m to compete.. Tjmte.is po one ip thjs city .engaged in the import trade enjoying capital and standing sufficient to justify .the description of “ merchant ”. The Indian traders carry on their business on the old lines and therefore there seems to be very little scope in Kerman for expanding the British trade. 22 . If) Overtrading qnd (Oommercial morality.— Except for the large stocks of piece-goods imported by tjie .Hindus the market has been normal in this fespect. Commercial morality continues to be good and the Imperial Bank of Persia seldom encm^ers any difficulty in this respect. ^ Z. 'Financial. 23. The carpet trade would appear to have beep -flourishing during the year under review, particularly the latter six months thereof, as the Bank’s purchases of Sterling show an increase over the corresponding period a year ago. In addition to this there have ffieen new buyers in the market from Hamadan, who are largely credited (in company with the Jejfts buying for London) with raising Ipcal prices. Fluctuations of exchange have not been such as to restrict trade, as the general trend has been steady in an upward direction, which, though at first sight might be thought to react lightly in restriction of the import trade, really brings its own compensations thereto by assisting the export trade and so putting more money in circulation. The average selling .rates during the year were Krans .47-47 -per £ Sterling 1 * Krans 357-64 per Rs. 100. Maximum and minimum rates during the year were :— Krans 51 and 45-34 per £ Sterling. Krans 381 and 345 per Rs. 100. The year under review was not a good agricultural year and prices have risen considerably in conse quence. The prospects Tor the morning year are still more gloomy owing to the failure of spring props and the appearance of locusts. 24. As regards the foreign capital of the Persian firms there is nothing to add to what was said in the last year’s report. The wealthiest of the local merchants are not mow occupied in foreign commerce and limit their activities to the management of their ( estates, the marketing of the products thereof and the granting of loans on mortgages. In offect the only importing houses of any im portance at the present time in Kerman are the British-Indian traders. 3. Taxation. 25. (a) Taxes levied .—No statistics are available ; ip this office. The effect of high customs and road taxes -on imports from abroad has already been dealt with above, vide paragraph 10 . The consumption of sugar and tea has not been effected by the high nmnopoly taxes. As regards list qfita^es collected in the province please see last year’s figures.£ 26. (b) Incidence of Tatcdtion.—A- greater part of the customs taxation falls on the poorer classes wh’h use commodities which bririg ndost of the revenue, e.g., tea, sugar, matches and piece-goods: Half the land tax, which constitutes three-fourths of the other taxes leviedi falls on the peasant. There is no tax yet especially designed to make the Wealthy pay in pro- por&lt;^^ to their wealth. The economic level of life in this ptovihce is low. 27. (c) Interference by, Tax Collectors. —Since the de parture of the American Mission corruption amongst the subordinate revenue officials has slightly in creased, particularly with regard to cases of opium smugglirtg', as, since the end of 1928, wheri'the opium monopoly law Was btfotfghtf into forbe, very little opium has been bought from the Government Ambars. The Government have thus lost heavily by the recent exorbitant increase of excise duty on opium, while the chances of smuggling and consequent income to subordinate revenue officials have also increased. 4. Military. 28. In the month of November, on account of the expedition to Persian Baluchistan, the military at Bam commandeered transport, causing temporary interference with trade by the Duzdap-Kerman route. Otherwise the military did good work in keeping order in Jiruft and Narmashir. The conscription law was enforced in this province from October 1928 and its efiects have already been mentioned elsewhere. 5. Agriculture. 29. (a) General. —Same conditions as described in last year’s report under this heading still exist. 30. ( 6 ) Opium. —As regards opium cultivation in this province please refer to 1927-28 report. The opium monopoly has so far been a failure, the reason apparently being that the Government wish to restrict local consumption without effecting export and without loss of revenue. 6, Industry. 31. (a) Carpets. —Figures regarding the carpet in dustry, the only industry of any importance, are given in Appendix II. The total figures of exports appear to be slightly less than those of last year, and this is due to the fact that the Jew traders were not able to buy any appreciable amount of old carpets, as they had purchased already last year most of the available stocks. Otherwise the carpet trade in general flourished. The total exports amounted to Hrans 11,571,000 against Krans 12,045,807 last year. Owing to the trouble experienced by the carpet firms at the frontier customs posts, the carpet firms in Kerman made joint representations to Tehran during the year for the establishment of a customs post in Kerman where the carpets could bb inspected for anilide and bales sealed, thus avoiding their re opening at the frontier posts. At the time of writing a customs official from Tehran had been installed in Kerman for the purpose. 32. (b) Electricity. —There is only one small private electric installation in the province. 33. (c) Mines.—No fresh moVe has been made by Persian Government in this respect. 7. Roads. 34. (a) Maintenance and new constructions KerVnan-Duzdap road still remains passable for motor's ahd nothing more. No Work was done On this road during the year. The Kerman-Yezd-Ispahan road is satisfactory. Work on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman motor road via Sirjan was continued during the year and, at the time of writing, the road was passable for motor traffic : lorries of over one ton weight cannot yet traverse this road. One or two big bridges and a considerable number of small bridges, repairs to the water ways and a good deal of rock cutting are still necessary, but the Engineer-in-Charge of the road awaits sanction of fresh funds for this purpose. A military road from Bam to Iranshahr (Fahraj) in Persian Baluchistan via Rigan has been built but cars traverse it with great difficulty. The Engineer-in-Charge, Bunder Abbas road, has been instructed by the Central Government to report on the possibility of making Kerman-Khabis road fit for motor traffic. If this road is made fit for traffic and a bridge built over the salt marsh, the other side of Khabis, it will be possible to build a motor road from Khabis to join the Duzdap-Meshed road near Birjand at very little additional cost. 35. ( 6 ) Motor traffic. —Motor transport of goods on the Kerman-Yezd-Tehran, Kerma/Bunder Abbas and Kerman-Duzdap roads has fnsw come into existence and it is expected that, in course of time, most of the goods will be transported by cars, thus having some sort of permanent effect on rates or turnover. 36. (c) Rates. —Appendix IV shows the compara tive rates of transport on the main routes this year and the last. 37. (d) Security. —Security has on the whole been good. The expedition to Persian Baluchistan did not in any way affect the security of the Kerman- Duzdap road. No robberies of importance took place on the other roads of the province during the year, 8. Social. 38. (a) Standard of living. —This remains the same as was reported last year. 39. (b) Unemployment. —There has been no im provement under this heading since the 1927-28 report wat written.4 40. (c) Public health .—Venereal disease and epide mics are the chief enemies of the public health in this province ; about 75% of the adult population is said to have suffered or be suffering from venereal disease. There are in addition the evil effects of the opium habit. During the year small-pox in the first case and measles in the second, in an epidemic form, visited Kerman, causing many deaths among the children. The Central Government have recently appointed a Health Officer to Kerman who runs a charitable dispensary and supervises inoculation, but a good deal has yet to be done. 41. (d) Municipal services .—Roads in the whole town are in a miserable condition and no improve -ini os stad ; h'A .. oilt s ...s ' ments are yet contemplated. So far all that the Municipality do is to put some lights in the main bazaar and to provide a few sweepers and watermen : still a part of the allotment finds its way to the pockets of the officials concerned. The town is dirty and the streets narrow, though in some cases en croachments have been knocked down. A new “ Khayaban ” has recently been Girted causing demolition of many houses and a loss of about 60,000 tumans to the owners. So far no com pensation has been paid to the owners : the Khaya ban is a zig-zag and not really fit for use by cars. As the Municipality budget has since been raised, some improvement may be expected. 1: Jr... ■ : o.:. ecr •: .•_&gt; . iJBST'.'i f308£liylI/Cl n i i ' . { ' amoJ-xio 'o'.o l odt Js &gt;'.s sq-ji t i./r j rsu. ncmioylLetter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. 5 Dated 20 SEP. 1328Trade Report on Kerman Consulate District for the year ending March 20th, I 928. 1. Trade. ^ (a) General conditions .—Appendix I shews the total imports into Kerman Town for the year 1927-28, compared with the previous three years. A.ppendix II gives the total export of carpets, shew ing route and destination. Appendix III gives the total exports, out of the province, including, besides carpets, all other items of any importance from Kerman and three other main centres of trade (Bam, Sirjan and Rafsinjan) compared with figures with the previous three years. Trade has on the whole been dull, but, with one important exception, piece-goods, the total volume of trade was approximately normal. The total importation of piece-goods dropped to the insignificant figure of 1,088 thousand krans, which is less than a third of last year’s figures and about one-eighth of the two previous years. In parti cular, English piece-goods, with a figure of 296 compared with 1,477 in 1926-27, had a very bad year. Some of the British trade, particularly in prints, has gone to Russia whose imports have improved to 200 thousand krans. It is difficult to find a satisfactory explanation of this enormous shrinkage. To a large extent it is due to heavy over-stocking in the years 1925 and 1926, the import figures for those years being abnormally high and the requirements for the years 1927 and 1928 being proportionately less. This explanation does not, however, meet all the facts as the market is still said to be overstocked and it is not credible that merchants can have so miscalculated in 1925 as to leave themselves with 3 years’ stock in hand. Other causes must be sought and the conclusion appears to be inevitable that the purchasing power of the masses must have been reduced. This is probably due partly to that fact that the money imported during the War for the South Persia Rifles and during the carpet boom of 1924 has all been expended and partly to the fact that this province has received practically no benefit (except an improvement in public security) from the heavier taxation that has been im posed in recent years. In particular no money has been spent on the “ nation-building ” depart ments and every year over half of the money col lected by Government in this province (to almost all of which, as I have endeavoured to shew else where, this province would appear to be legitimately entitled) is drained away for expenditure elsewhere. On the whole, however, the economic condition of the province appears to be much the same as it has been since the carpet boom of 1924 ; there has been no real prosperity and at the same time no acute depression. Trade has expanded a little in some directions and gohttacfed a little in others. ( 6 ) iVetc items of trade and new trade routes.— There has been little new trade of any importance except that, as shewn in the following paragraph, Russian prints have practically driven Manchester prints off the market. A significant feature was the importation of 80,000 krans worth of piece-goods from Ispahan and Yezd. This is an entirely new departure. A small consignment of candles has been imported from Messrs. Thomas Hedly of London. They com pare favourably as regards both price and qualitv with Burma Oil Company candles. As anticipated in last year’s report, there has been a Considerable increase in the imports of leather, mostly from India, boots having shrunk proportionately. There have been no Trade Routes opened. Russian imports from the north reached appreciable proportions this year for the first time since the war. The remarks made in last year’s report about re lative popularity of the Duzdap and Bunder Abbas routes and the reasons for it still hold good. The volume of traffic on the Duzdap road was less this year than the year before owing to the decrease in the exports of The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. (c) Growth of foreign competition .—The chief foreign articles competing with British goods are Russian piece-goods, oil and sugar, Italian piece- goods, German piece-goods and dyes, and American motor cars. The competition of Russian sugar is with the Indian trade though no doubt the English carrying trade is also affected. Non-Russian imports come from Java or Belgium, mostly via, India. Russian competition in sugar has not yet become a serious menace. Russia has made an increased effort this year to capture the oil market, but their competition in petrol is negligible, whilst in Kerosene oil they have only imported one fifth of the quantity imported by the Anglo Persian Oil Company. In piece-goods, on the other hand, the Russians have made considerable strides ( 200,000 krans worth ; about one-fifth of the total quantity of piece-goods imported). They sell prints of good quality and design at a price with which Manchester cannot compete and they have swept the market in prints and other cheap lines. Manchester cannot ap parently hope to recover this market as long as the Soviet Government can maintain their present financial system. Italy produces a thin cotton material with artificial silk design much used for ladies’ dresses and underclothing and Germany2 markets a well woven cotton and wool mixture, suiting material. Both these are cheaper » and only slightly inferior in quality to, the British products and threaten to oust them. .... In dyes it is hardly a question of competrtion as, for some unaccountable reason, the ri is industry continues apparently to make no e to get on to the market and German dyes have all their own way. The Persian Customs regula tions, which are particularly strict in the matter of dyes, are believed to have been so framed as _ to encourage the German and handicap ^ e rl trade; but no doubt something could be done to diminish this disability if the British ye shewed any inclination to push its pro ue s. import of German dyes has more than doubled this year, but the full extent of the market has not yet been reached as many of the orders were fy trial orders. The sale of motor cars though still insignificant has trebled this year (some 15 cars and lorries having been sold as compared with 5 the &gt;ear before). America has the monopoly of this trade for reasons which it is not necessary to enlarge upon. Id) Popularity of foreign goods due to qualtiy, price, terms of credit, etc.—The quality and price of competitive piece-goods has already been reter- red to. Russian sugar is inferior to the sugar im ported from India (it is said to contain dirt and to have a bad odour) and there is little difference in price. Russian oil is sold at the same price as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Oil. In respect ot credits, however, the Russians have a great advant age as the State is behind their trading concerns. The Russians pay the cost of the goods and their transport to Kerman and then allow retailers up to two months’ credit. German firms take -t per cent, or 30 per cent, with the order and the balance against delivery of goods at port of entry into Persia. British firms for the most part require cash against documents though a few have agreed to draw usance sight drafts against acceptance of bills. (e) British trade .—Apart from the big decline in piece-goods, there has also been an appreciable reduction in the imports of woollen goods, cotton yarn and boots. The importance of encouraging direct trade with the United Kingdom (as opposed to the purchase of British goods in India), which was emphasised in last year’s report, still holds good. In one or two articles, such as motor and bicycle tyres, cigarettes and china ware, a little progress has been made in this direction, but I be lieve further efforts could profitably be made es pecially in groceries, hardware and woollen yarn. ' (/) Overtrading and commercial morality .—Apart from the remarkable overtrading in piece-goods, extending back to 1925, the market has been normal in this respect. Commercial morality is on the whole good and the Imperial Bank of Persia rarely encounters any difficulty in this respect. 2. Financial. During the earlier part of the year trade was fairly active and money relatively plentiful. The es tablishment in August of a Quarantine Cordon round Bunder Abbas to prevent the spread of cholera irt land, almost paralysed trade for several weeks and the Bazaars found it difficult to liquidate the advances they had obtained. The Bank therefore^ adopted a more cautious policy. This led to some tightness in the money market which continued till the end of the year. The year under review was not a good agricultural year and the prices ^ of food grains, meat and wool have risen consider ably. The prospects for the coming year are no brighter owing to the failure of the spring rains. The average selling rates during the year were Krans 48/60 per £1 Sterling. Krans 369/96 per Rs. 100. Maximum and minimum rates during the year were :— Krans 50 and Krans 46J per £1 Sterling. Krans 38.2 and Krans 351 per Rs. 100. Apart from the foreign capital of the firms, there is very little capital in Kerman and all capital not required for financing the moderate amount of busi ness, that is done here, is locked up in land. Little or no capital is held abroad. There are very few merchants in Kerman with a capital of Tumans 50,000 (say £10,000). The wealthiest men are a few big landlords. The return on money invested in land cannot be great, but owners of capital evidently consider that the profits from investment on any scale in business are even more problematical under present conditions. Except in the case of one or two petty traders, there have been no bankruptcies. 3. Taxation. (a) Taxes levied .—As practically no statistics are available in this office, it is not possible to ana lyse the effect and incidence of the Customs, Mono poly tax, and Road tax imposts levied at the ports. The high monopoly taxes on tea and sugar have not affected consumption (sugar being roughly the same as last year and tea shewing an increase). The following taxes are collected in this pro vince :— Direct .—Land tax, certain taxes on pasturage and sheep, together with 4 shahis per Tuman on all direct revenue and 1 kran per khar- war on revenue in kind, earmarked for the Ministry of Education. Indirect taxes. —Opium, Tobacco, Vehicles, Liquor, Auction, Lottery and Shows. The following taxes were abolished during the year 1306 :— Sar-Shumaar, sowing tax, gaav-bandi, sorooki (caraway seed), khush-Mashirii (camping of nomadsk saaderaat (part of toll tax)3 I ID and some 60 trade taxes of the total value of about 500,000 krans p.a. The figures of taxes collected for the complete year 1306 are not yet available. The following are the figures for 1305 and for seven months of 1306, in thousands of Krans :— — 1303. 1306.

Possibly it is only (b) Incidence of taxation .—From the Duzdap and Bunder Abbas Customs figures' it appears that the value of the imports of matches, tea, sugar and piece-goods alone constitute nearly half the total value of all the imports. As each of these articles is used to some extent by even the poorest class (to the opium smoker of whatever class tea and sugar in considerable quantities are essential) the conclusion seems inevitable that the customs taxation falls unduly heavily on the poorer classes. It may be assumed that half the Land tax, which consti tutes about £ of the other taxes levied, falls on the peasant. It is clear therefore that (apart from a few luxury items in the Customs Schedule) there is no taxation specially designed to make the wealthy pay in proportion to their wealth. This fact, coupled with the failure of the Government to foster any nation-building departments (roads, agricultural works, public health, particularly with regard to 5. Agriculture. (a) General .—It is impossible to obtain any kind of figures of the area under cultivation as the Malieh Department keep no record of this. It is, however, safe to say that the area under cultivation has re mained fairly constant the last three years and that it is probably slightly less than it was ten years ago. No new crops or methods of cultivation have been introduced. There is a tendency for landlords, either through lack of means or short-sightedness, not to spend sufficient money on keeping qanats in repair, with the result that the supply of water diminishes or, even in some cases, dries up altogether. Sufficient water is available to allow of a very considerable increase in the area under cultivation in the province if the capital could be found to build dams in certain places and to improve some of the bigger qanats. Money so invested would almost certainly bring a fair return, but the sums required are too large for private individuals to risk under present conditions, when there are no roads to put the produce on the market, and no pros pects of commercial expansion, which might lead to a rise in the standard of living and so to an in creased local demand. It is estimated that about half of the agricultural land in this province is in the hands of a compara tively small number of landowners. In certain districts, such as Jiruft, which is perhaps the dis trict with the greatest agricultural potentialities, in the province, many landlords never visit their property for years on end, and no efforts are made at effecting any kind of improvement. In other districts they pay more attention to their property, but, with rare exceptions, they are reluctant to put any money into the land or to take the trouble to effect even such improvements as they know to be necessary and feasible. Of the remainder of the land, which is in the hands of small proprietors, the amount hypothecated is not unduly large. Generally speaking agriculture continues at a dull level of mediocrity.

(c) Interference by Tax-collectors .—There has been / ]^&gt;| Opium .—This has formed the subject of a a marked improvement in this respect as the result^ special report and it is only necessary to summarise of the efforts of the American Mission, except as the main points here. regards opium. 4. Military. There have been no instances of commandeering of transport this year in this province, nor, with a few exceptions in Jiruft, which were dealt with by the Officer Commanding as soon as they came to his notice, have the Military Department indulged in extortion or interference with] trade. On the other hand they have done useful work in restoring security in Jiruft and Narmashir, and they pay a proper price for all their purchases in Kerman and in the villages. The conscription law has not yet been enforced in this province. The opium question has a two-fold aspect; {i) its value to the cultivator as an agricultural crop, (ii) its deletrious effect upon the inhabitants of the province, who consume it. There can be no denying that opium is at present one of the staple crops of the upland tracts. It has many advantages over other crops. It requires less water than wheat and barley, as it is collected before the hot months ; being a valuable crop it is manured, and, opium itself being a good manure, the ground is considerably enriched, and a much improved wheat crop can be raised the following season ; whilst in the case of all other crops the ground has to be fallow 2 or 3 years before it canbe used again. As no Jstatistics are kept, figures can only be guess work. On the basis of the figures given in the report referred to above, which were checked and scrutinised as carefully as possible, the value of the opium crop to the cultivator may be estimated at from one to three million krans, according as the year is a bad or a good one. On the other hand, the financial advantage ac cruing from the cultivation of opium are more than offset by its disastrous physical and moral effects upon consumers. It is estimated that from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, of the adult urban population are opium addicts and all educated Persians agree in attributing largely to opium the inefficiency of labour and the general poverty of the masses of the inhabitants of this province. As I have attempted to shew in the report re ferred to above, I believe that, if the problem were approached carefully along the right lines, the culti vation and consumption of opium in this province could be largely reduced without causing any real hardship. ✓ 6. Industry. (a) Carpet 'industry. —Figures regarding the carpet industry, the only industry of any importance, are given in Appendix II. An unusual feature this year was the appearance of six or seven Jew's, with a small amount of capital, who bought up old car pets at almost any price for export to London, which seems to have superseded Constantinople as the distributing centre for Europe. Had it not been for this development Kerman would have suffered considerably this year from a slump in the carpet trade. Excluding exports by the Jews the exports of the Kerman carpet firms fell below ten million krans for the first time for many years. The reason for this decline w r as a slump in the American market, (nearly 3 million krans less than last year) due to increased competition from China, Greece and India, and to the threat of a prohibi tive increase in the tariff to protect the home carpet industry. The loss of a considerable proportion of the American business was, to some extent, set off by an improvement in the London, Paris and Swiss markets. The total export of carpets, including the exports of the Jewish buyers, w'as 12,045,807 krans. The activities of the Jewish buyers were for the moment beneficial to the industrial population, as house holders, finding that they could dispose of their old carpets and replace them by new goods, often of a finer quality and sometimes with an actual cash profit, freely placed orders for new carpets. These local purchasers, and certain other petty retail buyers for the London trade, were prepared to pay a higher rate for early delivery. As the total value of these individual purchases reached a considerable sum, the rates for the large contracts of the bigger firms were upset, and they found difficulty in doing busi ness. Such disturbances are bad for trade in the long run, and the effect will no doubt still be felt in next year’s trading. There has been some talk of Government inter ference with, or assistance for, the carpet industry but nothing definite has been done. ( 6 ) Electricity .—There is only one small private electric installation in the province. (c) Mines .—In the latter part of the year several geologists visited the province. At the time of writing two German geologists are just completing a .comprehensive tour on behalf of the Persian Go\« ernment. They report the discovery of iron and coal in fair quantities, but authentic information is not yet available. A separate report will be sub mitted on this subject in due course. 7. Roads. (a) Maintenance and new construction .—Nothing has been done to the Kerman-Duzdap road which ,*fill remains passable for motors and nothing more. Repairs have been effected to the Karman-\ezd- Ispahan road, the road being taken along an entirely new alignment in certain sections. The road is tolerably satisfactory in fair weather, but some parts of it are almost impassable after rain. Work on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road was begun in November 1927, but was stopped after a few weeks. In the spring of 1928 work was begun again, this time, apparently, in earnest. The portion Kerman- Sirjan (or Saidabad) has been improved, and a motor can already go to within 100 miles of Bunder Abbas. The first forty miles out of Bunder Abbas have been repaired, but the intervening 60 miles include the formidable Tang-i-Zagh. The Engineer- in-charge estimates that the funds at his disposal are sufficient to complete the road and he hopes it will be open for traffic by next spring. No resort is had to forced labour or forced levies for road- making. (fe) Motor trafjic .—It is evident from the above that the motor roads in this province have not yet developed sufficiently to have any appreciable effect on trade. No trade is carried by motors on the two most important routes (Duzdap and Bunder Abbas) and on the Yezd-Ispahan route the volume of motor traffic is not large enough to have had any permanent effect on rates or turnover. (c) Rates .—Appendix IV shews the comparative rates of transport on the main routes this year and last year. (d) Security .—Security has on the whole been good. A military detachment has been stationed in Bam for Narmashir and Jiruft and almost all the robbers who infested these districts early in the year have since been captured and dealt with. Setting aside Baluchistan, ’which remains as hitherto semi-inde pendent under Dost Mohamed Khan, security has now been established throughout the province, except for the southern portion of the Kerma«i-5 Bunder Abbas road which has been subjected to eight raids from Bashakerdi robbers and two from -Kudbar. 8. Social. . ( a ) Standard of living .—The standard of living is undoubtedly low in Kerman. The wages of a daily unskilled labourer in the town or in the field 4 ^ r erage about 2£ krans a day. The wages of a ohagird working in the carpet trade average from 2 krans to 3£ krans a day according to age and skill. The wages of the carpet workers are piece-rate wages and most of them could earn considerably more if they worked regularly and continuously. I he ordinary labourer, if he has a family, is unable to buy more than a very small quantity of tea, sugar, vegetables, or fruit, and lives almost entirely on bread with meat once a week. The small tenant farmer, with enough capital to lease, say, 400 qasabs of land, does a little better. (6) U nemployment .—No statistics of unemploy ment are of course available, but the opinion of educated Persians seems to be that there is more unemployment in Kerman than in most other big towns in Persia. This is no doubt due to the effects of opium and disease in lowering the general phy sical and moral standard of the people, and I believe that a considerable proportion of the unemployed are unemployable. There is no evidence of any emigration from the province. (c) Public health .—Apart from the evil effects of opuim, the two chief enemies of public health are venereal disease and epidemics. It is estimated that about 75 per cent, of the adult urban popula tion tfas suffered, or is suffering, from venereal disease. The cholera epidemic that broke out round Bunder Abbas in the autumn of 1927 did Vnn U n n ^ el 7. reach Kerman &gt; but it is reported that 5,000 died m Mmab districts out of a total popu- ation of about 25,000. It was mainly owing to the reasonably prompt and effective steps taken by the Persian Government that the epidemic was controlled and prevented from reaching Kerman. INormally, however, Government make no attempt whatever to provide for the public health and hygiene of the country districts. The activities of Govern ment in this direction are confined to providing one doctor, stationed at Kerman, for the whole province, and even he is poorly qualified and is given no funds, so that he can do practically nothing. (d) Municipal semces.—Hitherto the Municipal ity has had no funds to do more than put some lights in the mam bazaar and provide a few sweepers and watermen. The town is dirty and almost un- hghted at night ; the streets are tortuous and narrow, towards the close of the year the Municipal author ities began to widen some of the streets by knock ing down encroachments. So far the results have been negligible except to the unfortunate house- owners who receive no compensation. If the pro mised sums are made available in the 1928- 9 9 budget some improvements may be effected. At present there is practically not a single stretch of good road in the whole town. 00:I have the honour to forward a copy of the Trade Report for Kerman for the year 1926-27 compiled by His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. 4. CTRADE REPORT OF KERMAN CONSULATE DISTRICT FCR THE YEAR MARCH 1926 TO MARCH 1927. Transport. (a) Roads .—For travellers and for the Post, the Duzdap route is still the only satisfactory route for e^^jpunication with India. It can however scarcely bt Jlled a road. A small sum subscribed by private individuals has been spent on one or two of the worst portions and cars can get through without insuper able difficulty but each journey takes a good deal ' of the life of a car and motor transport for commercial traffic is still out of the question. Some progress has been made with the Yezd-Kerman road and the American Provincial Director of Finance informs me that when this road has been completed, in about 4 months’ time, the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road will be taken in hand. There has also been some talk of constructing the Kerman-Duzdap road but I do not think there is much likelihood of any work being done on that road in the near future. For trade the Duzdap route appears to be becoming progressively more unpopular each year as compared with the Bandar Abbas route which now absorbs practically the entire imports trade and about 66 per cent, of the export trade (i.e., about -fths of the total trade). Indeed were it not for the fact that the Duzdap route is very largely used by the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers which enjoys nearly half of the total carpet trade in Kerman, the Duzdap route would be dead. The main reasons why the Bandar Abbas route is preferred are, as regards trade with India, that it costs less to transport goods between Karachi and Bandar Abbas by sea than between Karachi and Duzdap by rail ; and secondly as regards trade with Europe and United States of America that steamers ply direct between Bandar Abbas and European ports and consequently a sum almost equal to the whole cost of railing from Duzdap to Karachi can be saved if shipment is made direct to and from Bandar Abbas. The existence of various minor trade centres along the Bandar Abbas road, provides a further stimulus to the use of this route. The cost of transport on the Bandar Abbas route also is slightly less than that of the Duzdap route as the latter is n^hdily desert whilst the grazing on the Bandar Abbas road is fair and the stages are short and convenient. (b) Security .—During the last month of the year there were disturbances on both the Duzdap road and the Bandar Abbas road.' In the latter case a large quantity of imports for Kerman was held up for some time en route. The disturbances on the Duzdap road have not so far led to a suspension of traffic as was the case last year. The number of Amnieh guards which is the same as last year, is obviously insufficient to cope satis factorily. even with the petty raids that usually occur in the spring, especially in a bad season. The road guards are now receiving their pay with reason able regularity. (c) Transport rates .—The following table shews the rates in Krans per Kermani Kharwar (687 lbs.) which prevailed during the year at the different seasons by the caravan routes shewn :— TABLE t Table of distances and transport rates between Kerman and other Trade Centres.

About 60 per cent, of the trade is in the hands of Hindus and as they are British subjects and have to keep proper accounts to submit to their head offices in India fairly satis factory information can be obtained from them. For the trade which is in the hands of Persians it is difficult to get any figures at all and quite impossible to get satisfactory figures. The following items in Table II call for remakrs :— (a) Piece-goods .—The figure this year has decreased from 10,400 to 3,698. This striking decrease of about 60 per cent, in the chief article of Import requires some explanation. I believe that the information supplied to this Consulate last year regarding prices was exaggerated as regards piece-goods from the United Kingdom. There has, however, undoubtedly been a big drop in the imports this year which is partly due to the fact that very large stocks remained on hand at the end of last year and partly to the fact that the British trade was at a standstill for a large part of the year owing to the coal strike. Moreover there has been a marked decrease in consumption owing to the diminishing prosperity of Kerman to which refer ence is made below. Last year woollen goods, with the exception of those imported direct from the United Kingdom were included in the piece-goods figures. * (b) Sugar .—Last year’s figure was low as traders ceased to import sugar during the last few months of the year hoping that the newly imposed Sugar Tax would be cancelled. The price of sugar has gone up by about 15 per cent. (c) Tea .—There is again a marked increase in the quantity of tea imported. The Tea and Sugar Taxes do not appear to have affected consumption though they disturbed the import trade for some months. (d) Oil and Petrol .—These figures include supplies for outstations which amount to about 25 per cent, and 6 per cent, respectively of the totals given. (e) General .—Apart from the enormous decrease in Piece-goods (6,700,000 Krans less than last year), there has been a general increase in the sales of almost all articles. As prices, except in the case of sugar, have decreased by about 20 per cent, the increase in the volume of trade is actually greater than that indicated by the mere increase in the value of imported articles. At the same time prospects are not bright and Kerman cannot be considered a prosperous commercial centre. The money brought here during the War by the South Persia Rifles and in the carpet boom of 1924 has now, for the most part, been spent; exports are diminishing every year and unless new life is put into the carpet industry of which there are no signs at present, the import trade will remain dull if it does not progressively decline. The trade with the United Kingdom and with India is dealt with in section 5(a) and (6) below.5 (b) Exports. TABLE III.

The figures of one carpet firm wore not available when last year s report was written. It was assumed that they exported the same quantity as the year before, viz., about 2,000,000 Krans to India for re-export. It will be observed that the value of the carpets exported has decreased by about 20 per cent. This decrease is largely due to increased competition from China and India as well as to the fact that improved machine-made carpets are now being pro- rduced in America. The system of advances com mented on in last year’s report, is still the prevalent system. The alternative of taking over the looms and dealing direct with weavers on a weekly wage system which was instituted in certain areas by the O. C. M., in 1925-26, requires large capital which other firms have not got. The experiment though not unsuccessful has not been so strikingly advantageous as to induce others to sink capital at a time when the carpet industry is dull. The advance system is admittedly risky and unsatis factory but no workable alternative has been found. Though it cannot be said that the honesty of the Ustads has improved, firms have experienced less trouble this year, as, owing to a decrease in demand, they have been able to exercise greater discrimina tion in choosing th£ Ustads with whom they make their contracts: The evils of the j system are felt most acutely by the O. C. M., whiph enjoys nearly 50 per cent. of_the total trade, as, during the boom in 1924 when every kind of Ustad was in great demand, they were forced, owing to the size of their business, to give their contracts in certain cases to Ustads, who later turned out to be dishonest. They have not yet succeeded in extricating thfm- selves from the difficulties in which they were thus involved. The future of the industry is not bright, owing to increased competition from new sources of supply, India and China, and owing to unbusiness like methods of manufacture, and it is anticipated’* that exports will further diminish. During the year two carpet firms (The North West India Trading Company and Messrs. S. Telfyan and Co.) closed down. As trade was slack they preferred to concentrate their energies on the other enterprises they have in hand elsewhere. One. new firm (The Standard Carpet Company) began business dining the year but they have only been feeling their way so far and have not yet begun to export. 4. Russian Trade Activities.

Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No. P.2628, dated the 26th August 1926. I am desired to say that the situation h«s taken a distinctly favourable turn since the period to which Mr. Law's report under reference relates. The possibilities of trade with Kerman have been brought to the notice of a large number of firms in India interested in the articles specified by Mr. Lav; and those evincing an interest have been introduced to merchants in Kerman. The present, however, does not appear to be a suitable time to address the Chambers of Commerce as the condition of traae in Kerman is very dull: Hindu merchants are selling their stocks at a loss and the exchange rate is further hampering business in articles imported by Indian traders. The&amp;) The Director General of Commercial Intelligence has been in direct correspondence with Mr. Law and is doing everything possible to foster the trade. To L.D.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Tefilifcj 5 ^ |y| Dated 22 JUL 192o Received ^ AUG 1926TRADE REPORT OF THE KERMAN CONSULAR ^DISTRICT FOR THE YEAR MARCH 22, 1925- MARCH 21, 1926. 1. General Information. See last year’s report. Transport. There is little to add to the remarks in last year’s report. The Duzdab-Route still suffers from the *two drawbacks mentioned therein ; but with every year that the railway to Duzdab continues to work the public confidence in that route will tend to strengthen. It has also been slightly cheaper this year (see next paragraph). Motor transport for commercial traffic is still out of the question by the Duzdab route ; but in spite of the difficulties caused by heavy sand river beds, and a steep mountain pass—through all of which there is only an apology for a road—the Duzdab route is becoming increasingly used for passenger traffic. A small special grant of Krans 3,000 was sanctioned by the Persian Govern ment for rough repairs to the track necessitated by exceptionally heavy winter rains last year. Krans 2,000 out of this grant were spent for this purpose under the supervision of the officer in charge of the I. E. T. D. station at Dehana Baghi, by the Officer Commanding troops to whom the funds had been made over. The new American Provincial Director of Finance has shown some interest in the matter of opening out communications in this Province. He favours the development of the direct route to the sea at Bander Abbas. But so far matters have not got beyond the stage of talking. As regards Security, there are 15 Baluch Road Guards stationed at 6 difierent points on the desert portion of the Duzdab route between Bam and Duzdab ; and there are guards stationed at 7 points on the Kerman-Baft-Bander Abbas route. Un fortunately the former have not been paid for 11 months (at the time of writing) : T have no precise information as regards the latter ; but there is little reason to hope that matters are any better in this respect on the Bander Abbas route This failure to pay the road guards constitutes a serious risk to the safety of such a road as that to Duzdab, for the potential disturbers of the peace in this area are the very tribesmen who are supposed to be paid to guard it. The fault lies not with the head -officers of the Kerman Province, I believe, but with subor dinates who are too inclined to spend on themselves the money entrusted to them for disbursement; but it cannot be said that the senior officers take any thing like serious enough notice of this shameful state of affairs. Twice during the year—for short periods—traffic along the Duzdab road had to be suspended owing to insecurity, once in the early summer because of the serious trouble among the tribes round Duzdab ; again, a little later, owing to a tribal fued in which the road guards themselves were involved. But there was no robbery during the year. Transport Rates. The following table jshows the rates in Krans per Kharwar (100 Kerman man of 6f lbs) by the two routes which prevailed during the year at the different seasons:— Kerman to Bander Abbas. Kerman to Duzdab. Bandar Abbas to Kerman. Duzdab to Kerman. Summer 180/200 150/200 220/280. 100/150 Autumn 150A so 180/200 160/180 Spring 120/150 120/180 120/150 isonso Thus, if any thing, the Duzdab route has been the cheaper : but generally speaking they are considered to work out about equal. A carpet firm (Messrs. Bardwil Brothers) has very kindly supplied me with figures showing the different cost of sending consignments of carpets to New York by the two alternative routes, i.e., Bander Abbas and sea to Karachi; or Duzdab and rail to Karachi. By the former, expenses varied from 2T5 to 2'36 krans per Kerman man : by the latter, from 2-61 krans to 2-95 krans. The Bander Abbas and sea route therefore works out on an average at £ kran per man less than the rail route (all charges such as insurance, commission, etc., being taken into account). At a rough calculation the year’s exports of carpets from Kerman weigh 100,000 man. The difference therefore to the carpet industry in general amounts to the substantial total of 50,000 krans. It is noteworthy that whereas the proportion of carpets exported by Duzdab and Bander Abbas respectively last year was 12 : 1|, this year the Bander Abbas route was much more used, the proportions being 14i: 121 Postage. See last year’s Report. 2. Banking and Exchange. Average selling rates during the year were :— Krans 43-17=£1. Krans 323-79=Rs. 100.

A comparison of this year’s figures with last year’s (which have been included in the above table for this purpose) shows some remarkable difference 8 which require an attempt of explanation. One obvious reason is that as stated last year, accurate figures are impossible to obtain. There was possibly a considerable margin of unavoidable error last year which this year’s figures (slightly more accurate, it is hoped) has exposed. This is principally the case in regard to Oil and Petrol. Last year’s figures were pure guess work, based on several independent enquiries. This year’s figures —owing to the establishment of an agency of the A. P. 0. C. in Kerman—are absolutely correct so far as Kerman is concerned. Part of the difference (krans 215,000 as against krans 1,000,000 estimated last year) is also to be accounted for by the fact that last year’s estimate included the consumption of Yezd, Bam and Rafsinjan which got their oil from Kerman. This year these towns got their oil direct from Bander Abbas under the new arrange ments made by the A. P. 0. C., and their consump tion does not figure in the Kerman table. The opening of the A. P. 0. C. sales agency, which has provisionally been given to Mr. Ali Asghar Moinzada, early in the year has proved satisfactorv to the public, which is now moderately certain of regular stocks of Kerosene and petrol (the quali-4 , fication is due to the not altogether perfect forwarding arrangements from Bander Abbas) and absolutely certain of the price to be paid which no longer depends on the needs of the consumer coupled with the cupidity of the erstwhile profiteer. Sugar. The noticeable decline in imports this year is due to two causes: (a) there were large stocks left over from last year’s imports ; (6) owing to the imposition of the sugar duty prices rose and demand fell. One firm, for instance, which imported 500 bags of sugar into Kerman last year (value About krans 135,000) imported none this year : and the Hindus complain that they cannot get rid of even the reduced stocks they now hold. The people are poorer than last year owing to the general rise in prices, and consume far less sugar and far less con fectionery. Tea. Imports last year appear to have been under, estimated. Apart from that there have been cons- siderable imports this year as there were no stocks in hand at the beginning of the year. (6) Exports. Glass a^d China Ware. Even with the reduced imports sales have been very poor : only about -joth of the value importt^^ The market was glutted before. Alizarine, etc .—The imports have been less than last year but not quite to the extent indicated by the figures (42,000 as against 130,000 krans) for the price has come down : Alizarine which was 24 krans per lb. packet last year selling at 14 krans this year. Cochineal. The reduction in imports appears to be due to two causes : (a) lessened demand owing, partly, to high price : and (b) the fact that last year’s figures included re-exports to Meshed which now, it seems, imports via Duzdab. The items numbered 17 to 33 have been added in this year’s table in order to make it more compre hensive and in order to illustrate the increased consumption of British goods which is commented on in Section 5 (a) of this report.

A f xa /• v,- u e i f x Decrease/ is due to low price on account of inferior quality of cotton (in which connection, see bectiond (a) of this repoit). '5 \ (c) The Carpet Industry. The turnover in the carpet industry has been about e same this year as it was last year ; that is, more than double what it was in 1923-24. In spite of this apparent prosperity the trade has had an anxious time this year ; and it is faced with many difficulties. The demand in America suddenly fell off early in the summer, owing it is supposed to the market being glutted, and firms were given urgent instructions to go slow for a bit. In the autumn work became normal again. But my personal opinion—for which I am solely responsible—is that all is not well with this industry which is, moreover, the chief source of livelihood for Kerman and one or two adjacent towns. As I noted last year, the industry is suffering from over expansion: the contract system on which it rests is admitted by all to be unsatisfactory : even perilous. At any one moment there must be at least 500,000 tomans (£120,000) outstanding as advances to ustads (master weavers). With a rising cost of living in Kerman which has made the town noticeably poorer this year than last, ustads have increasing difficulty in keeping honest and fulfilling their contracts. Several notorious cases occurred during the year of ustads either going bankrupt or mortgaging carpets which belonged to the firms to whom they had promised delivery. Side by side with this difficulty for firms, the ustads themselves have to deal with weavers who are becoming lazier, more inefficient and more dishonest, the weavers in their turn being corrupted by this system of advances. All of which means higher prices for the finished article, and poorer quality. As it is the trade seems to be working on the very margin of profit for ustad and weaver. Any increase in costs (such as the new compounded road tax will involve) means another jar to the top-heavy structure. This grave state of affairs has occasioned much concern to the firms and to the leading officials of the place who realize that Kerman’s well-being depends on the well-being of this basic industry. Suggested reforms are mooted and get little further : for it is almost impossible to get the machine out of the rut it is in. The best means of putting the industry on a sounder footing seems to be the elimination of the ustad (and thereby the abolition of the ruinous contract system) by firms taking over the looms and dealing direct with weavers on a system of weekly wages, as the O. C. M. have done in Jupar and Mahun. The few will suffer (but the best of the ustads will certainly be taken on as technical super visors, dyers, etc.) but the many will be saved ; and the savings on the interest of these huge advances of capital will enable higher wages to be paid and better conditions of work to be introduced. Inci dentally the carpet firms will be saved. As it is no one supposes for a moment that even 1 per cent, of the advances could be realized if firms were to endeavour to do so. The 500,000 tomans is practi cally irrecoverable. At present the firms’ only hope and only policy is to go on getting carpets as quickly as possible and as high prices as possible : but for every carpet they get in, more advances have to be paid out. Their future is indeed heavily mortgaged. The following table—compiled from figures which were given to me confidentially and for which I am much indebted, shows the out-turn of the different firms engaged in the business.

Mr. Ali Asghar Moinzada, their agent, has now placed a regular monthly order with this firm for six cycles, intended for Kerman and Yezd. This represents a yearly trade of 36,000 krans alone. So far, all the cycles exported by this Company have been sold as soon as the crates'were opened. Tyres .—The demand for tyres for cycles and for motor cars (which in Kerman alone number over 40 as compared with 12 two years ago) will now have to be satisfied ; and I have placed Mr. Ali | Asghar in communication with the Dunlop Rubber 1 Company with the object of establishing a sub agency for their manufactures in Kerman. Lamps .—The Incandescent lamps (made by P. I. F. C. 0. of Birmingham) imported during the year were disappointing. But I am convinced that there is a good market for these kinds of larrlps and Mr. Ali Asghar is in correspondence with another firm : I have also urged him to get into touch with a reliable firm of British lamp chimney manufac turers. The German and Japanese chimneys now in the market are not good. Miscellaneous .—Stationery and footwear have proved to be promising lines ; and definite enquiries are now proceeding as regards soap, biscuits and confectionery, and hardware. Motor Cars .—It is unfortunate that British Motor- Cars have not yet found their way into Kerman. There are occasional private enquiries. But the vogue of the ubiquitous Ford—slightly shaken though it is by the Dodge and Chevrolet—remains steady; partly because people hesitate to risk English cars on the miserable tracks which pass for roads in most parts of this Province : partly because they are nervous of the unfamiliar. If once the Clyno or Morris Cowley could be got a footing here I believe they would do well. The first essential is the introduction of one English car (for seeing is believingj; the second is an ener getic and trustworthy agent at Duzdab (not so easy as it sounds). Synthetic Dyes .—There is a possible opening in the Kerman carpet business of the synthetic pro ducts of the British Dyestuffs Corporation. But German firms are making a well organized/ attempt to capture whatever market there is—sending out representatives to Kerman with samples with which they give demonstration on the spot. If the British Corporation wishes to compete with them seriously,^ it must adopt more vigorous measures than it has up till now, in particula r.— samples, complete instructions, and colour chart'^' must be sent out. The conclusion is that a small but definite opening has been found for British trade in Kerman, which can already be measured in terms of £ s. d., through the medium of Mr. Ali Asghar Moinzada (to whom credit is due for his perseverance in face of many initial difficulties). And within limits this trade is capable of expansion. \b) Indian Trade .—It is not possible to speak so hopefully of the prospects of an expansion of Indian trade with South-East Persia. Attempts to get into touch with firms or factories who could export to Kerman a better quality tea than the Persian buyers in Duzdab and Bombay can procure and which the Kerman consumer would gladly pay for, have been met with the astonishing reply from the Calcutta brokers that they know better than the Kerman consumer what quality of tea he drinks and that it is of the best! The Chambers of Commerce of India are unwilling to make Mr. Ali Asghar their Honorary Correspondent. Mr. Ali Asghar himseR who addressed 6 prominent firms mentioned in the official “ Directory of the Principal Exporters of Indian Produce and Manufactures ” in regard to tea, sugar, and cotton yarn, was sternly discouraged by two of the. six, and received no answer at afl from the others. Such is the result of a year’s work. It bears out the opinion of the Director of Commercial Intelligence, that Indian business firms .in general are not prepared to expand “either money or energy ” on this trade. If that is so, / India will inevitably lose a good part of what trade she now has; and will make no new openings, though Delhi is nearer than Belfast for the supply of biscuits and confectionery; Cawnpore than Northampton for the supply of footwear and saddlery ; Aligarh than Birmingham for the supply of locks etc.; and Bombay than Manchester for the supply of piece goods. It is significant that while last year (according to the most carefully checked estimate) Bombay and Manchester shared equally in the profits of the piece goods market, this year Manchester’s share of the imports was 77 per cent, to Bombay 13 per cent.

I have read your remarks as to the prevailing attitude of business men in India with much interest. If in general Indian merchants are not even prepared to expend enerpy on this trade it is perhaps a waste of time on my part to deal in detail with the arguments with which they justify such a depressing attitude. But I cannot help pointing out one or two facts which seem to have been overlooked. For example Sir Percy Loraine’s observations as to the pre war predcnjjpnce of Russian trade in Persia generally, do not apply to this particular part of Persia. Trade in Kerman and the South-East of Persia was never largely, or even to any important extent, in the hands of Russia. And the natural laws of supply and demand so far as Kerman is concerned favour Britain and India rather /&amp;*&lt; t /Russia. Again the 'bad communications' which admit tedly increase Ine cost of goods to the interior open* ate here decidedly in our favour and against Russia. Resht for example which is the point of entry for most Russian products is 300 miles from Kerman while Duzdab is a little over 300 and Bander Abbas less than 275 miles. In other words the laws of economy a nd canons o± business which the Russian Government is defying in dumping oil, sugar and prints in Kerman at prices which barely cover the cost of transport in older to capture the market, at whatever immediate price, are waiting to serve the interests of British and Indian trade to our material advantage (and to uhe detriment of Russia's political aims) at the cost onl^ of some of tnat same energy which is the indis pensable requisite. 2 .2. To come to practical proposals which (as you rightly emphasize) are more useful than general observations; you outline three schemes marked (a), (b) and (c) on page 1 of your 'Notes' of the 10th October. It is hardly worth discussing them in view of your statement that none of the firms you have consulted is willing to act on any of them. Hie suggestion (b) that representatives should visit Persia with samples would of course have an admirable effect, and has been successfully acted upon by a German dye producing film which sent a representative to visit the carpet firms in this town last summer. The suggestion of a sample room is not one which I have favoured or even wished to press for. Your last suggestion is that I should give you the names of firms of good credit and repute and state exactly the commodities which it is desired to import. The latter information I had already given you in para (3) of my despatch No. 142 of the 11th February 1925 and in ray despatch Mo. 275 of the 13th March 1925. I repeat the information now so far as Indian products are concerned and add the names of reliable importers in respect of each item. A* On this point I join issue unequivocally with the Indian tea merchants who have discussed the question with you. I know - and they do not know - what qualities of tea come to Kerman; and I can positively assure them that it is of extre^y poor quality and that the Persian consumer would gladly drink better tea if he could only get it. But he can not. Being unable to obtain good tea direct from Indian plantations many are driven to purchase Brook bond's or Lipton's teas imported in tins via India at what I consider the very high price of 5/6 to 6/- (shillings) per lb. I myself purchase Darjeeling tea ln Karachi whlch ls greatly superior to Brook Bond's teatea, and it costs me only 2/6 to 3/- a pound imported in small quantities and from a retail shop. Several merchants here with v/hom I have discussed the matter say they would greatly prefer the Darjeeling tea; Put know not how to get hold of it. Their agents are either in Bombay, Duzdab or Bander APPas: they have to take what those agents send, and cannot write direct to the source of supply because they do not know who to write to. It is obvious, as I have said many times that in tea - as in other matters - if only direct communication between $*xm± importer and exporter can be established in cases where the accepted traditions of business render that practi cable much intermidiary expense^ will be eliminated and the Persian consumer will be able to get what he wants instead of what his agent compels him to take. h you could let me hajfe the names of one or two reliable Tea Estates or failing that, of Tea brokers in Calcutta who would be prepared to deal direct with the firms whose names follow, communication v;ill soon be established, and I am pretty sure that substantial trade will follow. Kerman Merchants:- f^ainian Brothers, Shahryar Khudabakhsh &amp; Sons, Kaji All Asghar Yezdi, Rustam Kaikhusrau &amp; Sons. a In view of what you say about Java sugar it seems useless to pursue this matter any further. - .£) h. X plead guilty to having used the word 'prints' loosely; Put I would add that the Persian consumer draws no nice distinction between 'prints' and coloured goods dyed in the yarn. They are all'parcha' to him. All he cs.res about is the pattern and the price. What is wanted in Kerman is a better quality of Indian piece goods - be they 'prints' or of coloured yarns - if Indian goods are not3 SA°\ not to loose their market. I add a list of prorai- I net importers; and in return ask for names of ex porting homes or middlemen in India with which these Persian merchants could correspond direct in order to get patterns and arrange terms of business. The Calico Printers' Association of Manchester have within the last few weeks sent me a magnificftStew collection of samples which I have shown to a large number of Kerman merchants; and excellent business is expected to result. I hope that the same thing may be possible in the case of the Indian Mills, the products of which now to be seen in Kerman reflect no credit on India nor on the acumen of the Hindu middlemen in Bander Abbas. Kerman Merchants Moainian Brothers, Shahryar Khudabakhsh &amp; Sons, Rustam Kaikhusrau &amp; Sons, Faraidoon Ardeshir, Haji Agha Bozorg and Haji Ali Naghi Jevaheri. HAKDWAKB. Locks, bolts, hinges and miscellaneous hardware are wanted. Kerman importers Shahryar Khudabakhsh &amp; Sons, Rustam Kaikhursrau, &amp; Sons, Jehangir Rustam, Faraidoon Ardeshir Haji Agha Bozorg, and Haji Ali Naghi Jevaheri. CONFECTIONERY. Sheets, preserved fruits, biscuits have a fairly great demand. The chief importer is S. Dorabjee, a Hindu firm, whom I have now brought into touch with Jacob &amp; Co. of Belfast in the hope of breaking into the Belgian monopoly. Could not Delhi, too, compete with Brussels? LEATHER , . Leather, boots and shoes, saddlery is a promising line for India, Cawnpore is nearer Kerman than are New York and Tokyo which supply the bulk of the foot wear at present. The chief importers are Moainian Brothers, Shahryar Khudabakhsh &amp; Sons Rustam Kaikhusrau &amp; Sons, Faraidoon Ardeshir- ’ Haji Agha Bozorg, Haji Ali Nagi Jevaheri.3. So tnuch for imports into Kerman. As regards ex* ports from Kerman I Peg to refer you to para 2 of my despatch of February 11th (No.142). 4. In conclusion and with reference to the first para of your letter, I Peg to state that the acknow ledgments of my despatches of February, March and June which were sent me by you in April and May last (para 1 of your letter of 16th October) never reached me.

Copies have been sent to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Minister, Teheran. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter No. |yj Dated 26 MOV 1925 Received - i OEC 1925•trade REPORT OF THE KERMAN CONSULAR DISTRICT FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 1. General Information. For information regarding coinage, weights and measures, dimensions of packages for animal trans port, reference is invited to the Trade Report for Kerman for the year 1912-13 which in this respect is substantially correct to-day except in two parti culars, viz.. Transport and Postage in regard to which time has brought changes. Transport. In addition to the old route from Bander Abbas, Kerman is now served by a route which connects Kerman with Indian rail-head at Duzdab. The Kerman-Duzdab route is becoming increasingly popular for transport of merchandise, but it suffers from two drawbacks : lack of sufficient camel trans port at Duzdab, and lack of capable forwarding agents at Duzdab. The second drawback may be remedied if the railway to Duzdab, the future of which is still uncertain, becomes a permanency. The route is used chiefly for exports from Kerman, as camels are available at this end. As soon as they reach Duzdab they pick up loads for the return journey. Thus loads arriving at Duzdab for Kerman have to wait for the arrival of camel caravans from Kerman, and the dates of such arrivals are naturally quite uncertain. If the railway becomes permanent better arrangements may be introduced for the transport of merchandise from rail-head. The Duzdab-Kerman route has on the other hand some advantages over the Bander Abbas route, particularly for exports from Kerman : it seems to be more secure from robbery ; it is not liable to be interrupted by snow ; and goods transported between Persia and India by that route are not exposed to the risks attending the lighterage at Bander Abbas. Accurate figures of traffic using this route are not available except in the case of the export of carpets. But it is evident that carpet firms very much prefer the new Duzdab route. Values of carpets , etc., exported via Duzdab last year amounted to nearly 12 million Krans, as against 1| million Krans ex ported via Bander Abbas. Rates of Transport. Rates of transport are decidedly less than they used to be ; and this is partly due, no doubt, to the greater security of the roads since the Persian Army became a force to be reckoned with. Average rates by the two routes are as follows :— — Bander Abbag-Kerman. Duzdab-Kerman. Spring Summer Autumn Krang. 170 per kharwar (i.e., 'l 100). 160 Kerman man of C}!bs.) J 220 Krang 150-200 irreg- i pective of geagon price varying with demand. The average time taken by caravan is about the same by both routes, i.e., 25 to 30 days. Postage. The mail from Europe which used to come via Bombay and Bander Abbas and take 6 to 7 weeks, under favourable circumstances; now comes on camels via Duzdab. Kerman is now within 2 weeks by post of any place in India; and 4 weeks from London. The service to and from Duzdab (a weekly one) is regular and punctual. 2. Banking and Exchange. Average selling rates during the year were :— Krans 41-66=£1. Krans 309-57 =Rs. 100. Maximum and minimum were 46 and 39| =£ 1 . 323 and 297 =Rs. 100. 3. The Year’s Foreign Trade. As there is no Customs establishment in the pro vinces and no official records of trade are kept, accurate statistics are impossible. The figures in the tables below (mostly obtained by private enquiry from individual merchants) are only appro ximate therefore; but they serve to give^a rough idea of the course of trade during the year in the principal articles of import and export.* €Tbc above figures bring out two facts of i m - g^rtance ; The first is the preponderating part tr^dp 1 f Tf HmdU c A ommunlt y P la 7 in the import trade of Kerman. As a matter of fact till two or three years ago Kerman depended almost exclusively on he Hindus for their principal imports. In the last year or two some Yezdi merchants have opened up business in Kerman (as well as in Bander Abbas Karachi and Bombay) and are doing well. The Hindus, rooted in their ancient methods, serve Kerman extremely badly. The trade is really in the hands of their community in Bander Abbas who send to Kerman for the most part the stuff they cannot sell in Bander Abbas. This gives Indian and Manchester piece goods, in particular, a bad name. The Hindus are lacking in enter prise , make no attempt to open up new markets or introduce new goods, and do not ically consult the wishes of the consumers. If the Hindus find themselves gradually ousted from their position they will have only themselves to thank. Their fate would not be worth a tear. But the trouble is that their failure would in existing circumstances adversely affect British and Indian trade which is almost entirely m their hands at present and give an opportunity to other countries to establish sugar COmrnodltles ’ Ru ssian prints, Russian The second is that with the exception of Man chester piece-goods, and a little woollen yarn, the United Kingdom exports practically nothing to Kerman. A few boots and shoes; some China- ware ; a few odds and ends such as drugs, biscuits these about complete the list; but do not anything like represent the possibilities. The question is discussed more fully in the last section of this report. (b) Exports. The following table gives the approximate value ot the exports from Kerman in 1924-25 ; and in the case of carpets and rugs, and cotton (the principal - exports) the value in 1928-24 for purposes of com parison.

The extraordinary increase in the carpet business— the figures are more than double last year’s-is ex plained by the recent brisk djj ggftn d from America^ and the high prices which have^onered. Advantage has been taken of these conditions to expand the industry to the utmost possible extent. Of 17 firms engaged in the business in 1924-25 as many as 9 are new ones where turn-over amounted to over Krans 5,000,000 in the year—nearly 40 per cent of the total. Looms have sprung up in the town like mushrooms. But there is grave danger that this boom in the business will cause its own ruin. Firms are in such a hurry to carry out orders, and master- weavers to carry out profitable contracts on behalf of the firms, that quality is being sacrificed to quantity. As quality deteriorates f if for no other reason the demand is almost certain to drop, and many cbatious men in the trade predict a slump in the near future—with all its distressing consequences. Meanwhile the industry certainly flourishes and provides the chief means of Kerman’s paying for its imports. It consumes far more than all the available wool grown in the province; and provides occupation for large number of men, women and children not only in Kerman itself but in outlying villages like Jupar and Mahan.

Constantinople again tomes third, but Canada is ousted from the fourth place by India, a new market and a very profitable one from which much may be hoped especially if the demand from America^ flags. (d) Cotton. Last year it is estimated that 300,000 man were exported at an average price of Krans 8-50 per mam This year 1924-25, 350,000 man were ex ported but the price was only Krans 8. It seems that the cultivation of cotton is being extended ; but it is doubtful how far extension will prove profitable or meet with encouragement Ijgm Bombay. A recent report of the Cotton Expert with the Government of India on Kerman cotton states that “ Persian cotton is not sought after in Bombay; neither the staple nor the grade being satisfactory ; which is exactly the opinion of the Commercial Mission which visited South-East Persia on behalf of the Government of India in 1904-05, 20 years a cr 0 . It seems worth while finding out by practical experiment whether Kerman cotton (produced for the most part in Rafsinjan) can be improved up to the standard required by Bombay, before encouraging schemes for extending cultivation. 4. Russian Trade Activities. The Soviet Consulate showed considerable acti vity in regard to trade in the past year in three directions :— (o) Cotton Cultivation .—In July the Soviet Cotton Expert from Tehran, Mr. Grego rian visited Rafsinjan and Kerman. Several meetings were held in both places at which there was much talk about the Russian stocks of seed in Tehran and the advances both in money ar.d seed which the Russians were prepared to make to enable cotton cultivation to be ex tended. The whole thing apparently ended in talk and nothing more has been heard about advances of seed or money. (6) Oil .—More practical has been the attempt to establish Russian oil in Kerman. In December 1924 the Soviet Consul im ported 50,000 Kerman man (value over Krans 250,000) of Kerosine oil as well as considerable amount of Russian petrol from Baku. The arrangements for marketing A. P. O. C. oil being extreme ly unsatisfactory (supplies from Bander Abbas being uncertain, the prices being ^extravagantly high and there being noagency in Kerman), this Russian oil which was cheap and which was also believed to be superior in quality, sold very well from the beginning. The Soviet Consul appointed an agent who set up a shop called the Russo-Persian Oil Sho^; and the sales as well as price of A. P. 0. C. oil dropped immediately. The matter was reported to the A. P. 0. C. who are investigating the situa tion. (c) Piece-goods .—Here again the unsatisfactory arrangements in existence for the sale of Manchester and Indian piece-goods gave the Russians an opportunity for popularizing their own prints. One hundred thousands Krans worth of Russia-** prints were imported into Kerman from Khorasan and Tehran. The quality and price compared .very favourably with the Manchester and Indian piece-goods which the Hindu merchants at Bander Abbas send up to Kerman. The whole lot of Russian piece-goods were sold off very quickly. The Soviet Consul recently intimated to the Kerman Chamber of Commerce that he was ready to import a verv large quantity of these prints and is busy making arrangements with agents for their sale in Kerman. The Russian terms of business are very generous; 10 per cent, with order and the balance on delivery of goods. Unless the methods of trade in Manchester and In dian piece-goods are improved Russian prints will certainly take their place to a considerable extent. Attempts are now being made to bring importers in Kerman into direct touch with the Manchester and Indian exporters, this being the only means by which the Ker man importer can be sure of getting good stuff to suit his taste at reasonable prices. 5. Prospects for British and Indian Trade. Such British goods as are on sale in Kerman, from Manchester prints to screws, are bought in Bombay. It is unnecessary to point out how uneconomic such an arrangement is, for before they reach Bander Abbas, the port of Kerman, all goods ;so bought' have already paid several quite unneces sary charges; commission in Bombay, freight to Bander Abbas,, -Indian duty v And worst of all, the goods have been bought not by the importer ’ from samples, but by agents who are either like the Hindus careless of the needs of their clients, or in the case of miscellaneous goods by Persians in India who have only access to the petty retaf* shops in Bombay or Karachi which only go in for the cheaper class of foreign goods. British goods do not, therefore, have a real chance in Kerman, and will not until direct commercial relations can be established with the United King dom whereby wasteful charges can be eliminated and goods supplied which are wanted. Direct commercial relations will not establish themselves automatically, because the Kerman importer is unknown to the British exporter; and further, without catalogues which he can read or samples which he can handle, the Kerman importer has no conception of the number of things which he could—to the great advantage of Kerman—import from the United Kingdom. Boots and shoes, China-ware, lamps and lamp chimneys, soap, hard ware, .drugs,j-warm woollen material for clothing, bicycles—thes6w-e all lines in which I believe trade- nonexistent at present—could be opened between Kerman and the United Kingdom to mutual ad.- vantage if only the necessary conditions could be established. The Hindus, who as I have stated, enjoy the lion’s share of the import trade of Kerman, are for various reasons useless for this purpose. The ideal arrangement would be the establishment in Kerman of a British firm with capital and energy. Failing such a solution the next best plan is to have an agent in Kerman, with a knowledge of English and of business, capable of introducing buyer to seller. This has been done. A Persian business [man member of a Firm in Kerman (Mr. Tarjuman ul Wizara) has been appointed as Honorary Corre spondent of the London Chamber of Commerce and by this means it was believed that he would get into close touch with British firms capable of supplying what Kerman wants, and that British firms would be encouraged to send this gentleman samples of their goods so as to. render possible the opening of a sample room in Kerman. Things have not moved quite as quickly as had been hoped. But the immediate and practical needs of the situation which are now apparent have been brought to the notice of the Department of Overseas Trade (as well as of the Director of Com mercial Intelligence in Calcutta). It is too early to speak of expectations. But if British firms are ready to take advantage of them arrangements now exist for introducing their goods to this market. That at any rate is a beginning. As regards India there is much that India can and must supply to Kerman. But this trade too can be improved. At present we get poor piece-goods, poor tea, no sugar. Enquiries are being made with the object of remedying this state of affairs, which is surely possible at all events as regards improving the quality of the goods India sends here.
