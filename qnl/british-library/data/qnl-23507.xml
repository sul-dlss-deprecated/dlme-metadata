Dear Sir, * The Company's insurers have recently stipulated that the transfer of cash from the Manama banks to Awali be placed under an armed European guard during transit. The Company is aware that normally this would be the responsib ility of the State protection organization but realizes the burden that such a request would place upon the State Police if it were possible for them to comply, and therefore the Company requests permission to arm its European guards when they act as guards during the transfer of cash. It is proposed to arm these guards only during the time that they are actually responsible for this movement and at other times the arms would be kept under lock and key under the Chief Local Representative's direct control. The arms thought suitable are a shotgun or riot gun type - a type that is not a concealed weapon or one that can be worn while on other duty. The Company would therefore be pleased if you would approach the Government in regard to this matter, and if there is no objection to the plan as outlined, the Company would appreciate a permit allowing up to six shotgun type guns to be in its ■ possession. * Your earlv advice will be appreciated. ^ \-T\C'- Yours very truly. v 8 9 3 2.(7 R .M.
