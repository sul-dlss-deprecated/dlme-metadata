EASTERN ( Arabia ). [December I (3 .j CONFIDENTIAL. S kotion 4. [E 15722/2854 441 No - ] - t Memovanduin by Colonel Cornwallis on the buture Policy of I lis Majesty s Government with regard to Subsidies to Chiefs of the Arabian Peninsula. AT a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Conference on Middle Eastern Affairs \ held at the Foreign Office on the 7th December, 1920, it was decided that a memorandum i' should be prepared in the Foreign Oflice giving a reasoned statement of policy toi the future as regards subsidies, on the basis of :— (a.) Participation in equal shares by His Majesty s Government and the Government of India. (b.) Adherence to treaty obligations. (c.) Provisional yearly total of 100,000/. to be distributed by agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. (d.) Participation by other Powers interested in the pilgrimage in financial support to the Hedjaz. This statement of policy to be submitted in the first place to the India Office for concurrence, and subsequently in its final form to the Government of India and the representatives of His Majesty's Government concerned tor their views. On receipt of these views, the Treasury to be approached for their final sanction to the total agreed upon between the India Office and the department of His Majesty's Govern ment responsible for Arabian policy. 2. The (juestion of future policy is discussed in paragraphs 3 to 1/. The advisability of making certain temporary arrangements during the current financial year is dealt with in paragraph 18. 3. It will be convenient to consider the policy which His Majesty's Government should adopt for the future under the following heads :— (a.) The present position of Arab chiefs in the matter of subsidies. (5.) The obligations to which His Majesty's Government are already committed either by treaty, custom or policy. (c.) After deducting the amount which these obligations represent, the manner in which the balance of the provisional sum of 100,000Z. can best be divided amongst the remaining chiefs, taking into consideration their relative importance, their past and present services, and their capacity to injure or benefit British interests in the future. 4_(a.) T*he present position of Arab-chiefs in the matter of subsidies. This is as follows : — (i.) The Sultan of Muscat receives annually 186,400 rupees. (ii.) The Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla receives annually 720 rupees, (iii.) Fahad Beg of the Anazeh receives annually 204,000 rupees. (iv.) The Aden protectorate chiefs receive annually 70,000 rupees. (v.) Ibn Saud receives annually 60.000/. (vi.) King Hussein receives no subsidy. (vii.) The Idrisi receives no subsidy. (viii.) Ibn Kashid receives no subsidy. (ix.) Imam Yahya receives no subsidy. (x.) The Sheikh of Koweit receives no subsidy. (xi.) The Sheikh of Bahrein receives no subsidy. (xii.) The trucial chiefs receive no subsidy. 5__(6.) The obligations to which His Majesty's Government are already committed by treaty, custom or policy. (i.) Muscat. —The subsidy paid to the Sultan is made up of the sum ot 86,400 rupees, which was first paid by the Government of India in 1873 as repre senting the amount of the tribute formerly paid by the Sultan of Zanzibar under an [5096 4] e Barbitration award delivered by Lord Canning, Viceroy of India in 1861, and a lurther sum ol 100,000 rupees approved in 1911 in connection with the agreement lor the regulation ol the arms traffic. The modification of the former sum is scarcely possible under any circumstances, but the reduction of the latter might be considered by the India Office and the Government of India from the point of view of the desira bility ol reducing this subsidy to its true proportion in comparison with the subsidies which will be granted to more powerful chiefs. (ii.) SJiehr and Mokalla. —The nominal stipend of 720 rupees per annum is paid to the Sultan in accordance with the terms of his treaty in 1882. It is not considered necessary to increase this amount since the Sultan was granted a loan of 400,000 rupees in 1917. (iii.) Anazeh. —Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal is paid 17,000 rupees per mensem from Mesopotamian revenues in return for certain specified services, and his case is there- lore outside the scope of the present memorandum except in so far as his subsidy is likely to be taken as a standard by other chiefs and compared to the detriment of the amounts which will be offered to them. (iy.) Aden. —The stipends, amounting to 70,000 rupees per annum, are paid to the chiefs of the protectorate chiefly by virtue of treaty rights, and cannot therefore be reduced or cancelled so long as His Majesty's Government maintain a hold over the protectorate. It is not, however, suggested that they should be increased. (v.) Sejd. —The subsidy to Ibn Saud has been paid as a matter of policy and not in fulfilment of a treaty obligation. The question of its reduction is discussed later. It will be seen that, setting aside the subsidies to Ibn Saud and Fahad Beg, British obligations at present amount to 257.120 rupees per annum, and that the subsidy paid to the Sultan of Muscat is the only one which is susceptible of modification. 6.—(c.) The manner in which the balance of the provisional sum of 100,000/. can best be divided. His Majesty's Government are now faced with the double task of substantially reducing their financial commitments in Arabia, and at the same time of securing the special position for which the good-will of the chiefs is as necessary as is the consent ot the Principal Allied Powers. This task will be rendered more difficult by the policy which has been pursued in the past. The exaggerated scale on which subsidies have up to now been calculated has, indeed, given rulers like King Hussein and Ibn Saud such an undue idea of their own value that the greatest care and tact will have to be exercised in making them realise that the reduced rate at which it is proposed to subsidise them in future carries with it no disparagement and that it is due, not to a dimunition in confidence or friendship, but to the inevitable transition from war conditions to those of peace. Ibn Saud, in particular, may prove difficult to deal with since he has been pressing for an increase for many months and, in the opinion of Sir Percy Cox, who lias recommended that his subsidy should be increased to 100,000/. per annum, is in serious monetary difficulties. In this connection, it will be remembered that fears of a similar nature were entertained last year when the question of reducing the subsidy to King Hussein was discussed. These forebodings, however, did not prove true, since the King's subsidy was not only reduced from 100,000/. to 25,000/. in three months, but was altogether discontinued from the end of February last without causing more than a slight aggravation of his fancied grievances. This precedent may not be without value in forecasting the attitude of Ibn Saud, the drastic reduction of whose subsidy is a necessary preliminary to the introduction of the new policy, for the reason that it approximates to the total which is available for division amongst all the chiefs. 7. In his and other cases, it is submitted that the best way of disarming criticism is by making a frank explanation of the situation, coupled with assurances of continued friendship and an indication of the many benefits which any small State must receive by the mere fact of being in treaty relations with and enjoying the protection and support of His Majesty's Government. This may not be appreciated at its full worth in the first instance, but practical evidence can be given in the future by a readiness to assist in other ways. These would, from a financial point of view, consist chiefly in fostering trade, in developing the prosperity of Arabian ports by such steps as inducing steamship companies to call and in taking other measures which might lead to an increase in revenue without burdening the British taxpayer. 8. A factor of more immediate importance, and one on which the success of thenew proposals will largely depend, is the necessity of dividing the money available in such a manner as to eliminate all cause of jealousy between the different chiefs, and to convince them that it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to treat them justly and with a due regard to the positions which they hold. A careful appraisement of their respective merits is accordingly necessary, and it will be convenient to consider in the first place the cases of the three small States of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast and, afterwards, those of the five rulers who dominate the greater part of Arabia. 9. Koweit. —The Sheikh of Koweit is not in receipt of a subsidy, but he has a stretch of foreshore (Bundar Shwaikh) which is leased by His Majesty's Govern ment, and he is exempted from payment of taxes on his date gardens in Basra to the extent of 60,000 rupees per annum. The civil commissioner at Bagdad has recommended that the lease should be terminated and that, in compensation, a sum of lOwOOO to 12,000 rupees per annum should be paid to him quarterly in arrears, admittedly as a subsidy and subject to his good behaviour. The exemption from payment of taxes on the date gardens in Basra is presumably a matter which only concerns the Mesopotamian Government. The payment of a subsidy in compensation for the lease of the stretch of foreshore is still under the consideration of the India Office and the Indian Government, but the possibility of its becoming a charge against the provisional sum of 100,000/. must be taken into account. 10. Bahrein and the Trucial Coast. —The advisability of granting subsidies to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the trucial chiefs appears open to argument, since for many years satisfactory relations have been maintained with them without resort to such a course, and, so far as is known, there have been no pressing demands from the sheikhs themselves. This is a matter on which the India Office and the Government of India must advise, but if it is decided that the exclusion of Bahrein and the trucial coast from the benefits which are being accorded to other chiefs is inadvisable, it is suggested that their respective subsidies should not exceed that granted to the Sheikh of Koweit. It may be remarked that the question of subsidising the Persian Gulf chiefs is of relative unimportance, since they owe most of their prosperity to the support of His Majesty's Government, and must realise that their geographical position renders their retention of that support vital. It is extremely unlikely that they will ever cause any serious trouble, and His Majesty's Government can therefore afford to disregard any personal feelings which they may have in this matter and decide each case purely on its merits. 11. The Hedjaz and Nejd. —The general peace of Arabia to-day centres round the actions of King Hussein and Ibn Sand, for, although the other great chiefs may make war on their immediate neighbours, there can be no widespread conflagration in which King Hussein and Ibn Saud do not take part. During the last three years war between the two has seemed imminent on many occasions, and the danger is perhaps as great to-day, but always some factor has arisen to avert it and to confirm the impression that neither dares to put the issue to the test. It is not easy to appraise the fighting strengths of two chiefs whose countries are so inaccessible, and if available evidence turns the scale in favour of Ibn Sand it must not be forgotten that he has formidable enemies in the Sheikh of Koweit and the Shammar, and that he would leave his flank exposed if he attacked the Hedjaz. From the point of view of His Majesty's Government, Ibn Saud is a man to placate on account of the menace which he might become to Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, and the Holy Places of the Hedjaz, and to reward in return for the friendship which he has shown. During the war his services were more of a negative character, but since then he has undoubtedly rendered great assistance by his control of his unruly and fanatical tribesmen. He has proved himself possessed of statesmanlike qualities, in marked contrast to those of his rival. King Hussein, and his continued friendship and dependence on the advice of His Majesty's Government will prove to be of the greatest value in the future. It is generally recognised that the Ikhwan movement represents a danger which, if allowed to continue unchecked, might overwhelm the Hedjaz and spread rapidly northward to Syria and Mesopotamia, and there is little doubt that the restraining influence of Ibn Saud has been chiefly instrumental in keeping it within bounds hitherto. The claims of King Hussein to the favour of His Majesty's Government rest rather on his past than his present services. It is a matter of history that King4 Hussein, both by jeopardising his own future at a time when the issue of the war still hung in the balance and by his subsequent actions up to the time of the armistice, rendered assistance which was of real value to the Allies, and if, since then, he has adopted an attitude which is inconsistent with his former protestations, it can at least be argued that it has been for reasons which have found sympathy in the minds of many thousands of Arabs. King Hussein is open to adverse criticism from almost every point of view, but that should not obscure the fact that he is ruler of the land which contains the Holy Places of Islam, and that, so long as the Hedjaz remains an independent State with him at its head, it is strongly to the interests of His Majesty's Government to support him and his successors, and to use every eftort to promote friendly relations. It is doubtful whether the revenues of the Hedjaz will prove sufficient to ensure the administrative efficiency which is so necessary for the success of the pilgrimage, and the fact that the Allies have driven out the Power which was formerlv responsible for the maintenance of the administration constitutes a further obligation to offer substantial assistance to the newly-formed State. King Hussein and his sons are capable of doing great harm if they fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks and Nationalist Turks, not only in Palestine, Transjordania and Mesopotamia, but in all parts of the Empire from which pilgrims annually meet at Mecca. It is of the utmost importance that the Holy Places should become centres of friendly instead of corrupting influences, and King Hussein is in a position to earn the gratitude of His Majesty's Government, not only by seeing to the comfort of the pilgrims, but also by rooting out enemy propaganda and creating in its place an atmosphere of friendliness to His Majesty's Government. From the above survey, it will be seen that from the point of view of His Majesty's Government both Ibn Sand and King Hussein can materially advance or harm British interests, and since each claims to be stronger and more powerful than the other, and each has had for many years at the bottom of his heart the ambition to become the head of a United Arabian Empire, it is suggested that the fairest way of treating them in the matter of subsidies will be to give them each an equal amount, and one which is in excess of that given to any other chief. This will avoid any accusation of favouritism, and if the smallness of the sum causes disappointment, it can be pointed out to King Hussein that His Majesty's Government have invited the other Principal Allied Powers to support him, while, as indicated in paragraph 7 above, assurances of a more general character can be given to Ibn Sand. The symbol 3 is recommended as showing the share which each of these chiefs should receive. 12. A sir. —The Idrisi of Asir, though not so powerful as either King Hussein or Ibn Sand, is nevertheless an important factor in Arabian politics, and his alliance with any other chief, if made with hostile intention, might upset the balance of power which at present exists. From the point of view of His Majesty's Government, he might prove harmful either by attacking King Hussein, with whom he has long been on terms of scarcely- veiled enmity, or by allowing himself to come under the influence of some foreign Power. His potential value lies chiefly in the assistance which he might render if the Imam Yanya decided to attack the Aden Protectorate. During the war he showed no hesitation in joining the Allies against the Turks and. in spite of a reasonable disappointment over the Kunfuda affair, he remained consistently loyal. He received a substantial subsidy during the war, which was not entirely discontinued until the 1st July, 1919. In view of his past and present attitude, and the fact that the Political Resident, Aden, has frequently pointed out the financial difficulties under which he is labouring, it is recommended that he should be treated more generously that either Ibn Rashid or the Imam Yahya, and that his share in corn parison with the other chiefs should be represented by the symbol 2. 13. Yemen unci Hail. —The cases of the Imam Yahya and Ibn Rashid differ from those discussed above, in that they were both hostile during the war, and that neither of them has yet come to terms with His Majesty's Government. They are therefore not entitled to any consideration on the grounds of past services, and when the question of the payment of a subsidy to them arises, it will have to be looked at purelv in the light of a business proposal and as an insurance against any military commitments. The ruler of Hail is a small boy whose power at present is overshadowed by that of his powerful neighbour Ibn Saud. It seemed likely at the beginning of this year that Il&gt;n Saud would gain complete control of Hail after the murder of Saud Ibn Rashid, but his failure to do so and the recapture of .lauf by the Shammar showthat the latter are determined to maintain their independence, and that there ls sti a possibility of their regaining the dominant position which they held during last century. However this may be, it can be said that at present Ibn Rashic i&gt; o importance to His Majesty's Government as the ruler of a country through which many thousands pass annuallv on their way to and trom the pilgrimage, as a chec on the spread of the Ikhwan to the north, and as a possible raider against Mesopo tamia. His friendship is, therefore, a matter of some importance. He has several tentative advances to Sir Percy ('ox, who suggested that a meeting shou d take place at Nasiriyah this winter, but his attitude since that proposal was made has not been so satisfactory, and Sir Percy Cox has decided to take no further action at present. . i * i * The Imam Yahya has proved more hostile than Ibn Rashid since the armistice. He has laid claim to the whole of the Aden Protectorate, and has maintained his officials at Dhala and other places in the north since the spring of this year. Negotiations have proved of no avail, chiefly owing to the tact that he ictuses to recognise His Majesty's Government as having any right to discuss the affairs ot the Yemen. It is known that he has approached other foreign Governments, and until the special position of His Majesty's Government has been recognised b\ the Principal Allied Powers it will probably be found impossible to come to terms with him. The military strength which he could bring to bear at any time against the Aden Protectorate is apt to be exaggerated. It is true that Ahmed leizi Pasha required 50,000 men in 1904 to reconquer Sanaa, but he had to contend with a unitedly hostile people. Since then large tribes, such as the Hashid and Bekil, have proved disloyal, and an invasion of the protectorate on a large scale is unlikely so long as the Idrisi remains hostile to him. The Imam can, however, collect sufficient forces to cause His Majesty s Government considerable embarrassment and to overcome the local tribes, and it will probably be found cheaper in the end to pay him a subsidy than to eject him by force. Neither in his case nor in that of Ibn Rashid is there any question of immediate payment, but since there is a possibility of some arrangement being made with both of them during the financial year 1921-22, it will be advisable to make some provision in the division of the allotted sum. It is recommended that the unsatisfactory attitude of these chiefs should be . taken into account, and that their shares should each be represented by the symbol 1. 14. The proportions according to which (after the subsidies to Muscat, Shehr and Mokalla, the Aden chiefs and, if approved, Koweit, Bahrein and the trucial chiefs, have been subtracted) it is recommended that the balance of the provisional sum of 100,000/. should be divided between King Hussein, Ibn Sand, the Idrisi, the Imam Yahya and Ibn Rashid'are, respectively, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1. No attempt has been made to indicate the value of these shares in terms of money, since the rate at which it will be decided to calculate the rupee is unknown. 15. In view of the fact that it will be convenient in future to pay all subsidies in rupees, and of the further fact that the payment of regular and unvarying sums to the chiefs is most desirable politically, it is recommended that the provisional sum of 100,000/. should be converted into rupees, with due consideration of the present and possible future rates of exchange, and that the sum in rupees which is finally settled should be considered as representing the amount permanently available for subsidies. Chiefs in Arabia are not versed in the intricacies of questions of exchange, and they would undoubtedly misunderstand the reasons for a sudden reduction in their subsidies which might be necessitated by a change in the rates of exchange. The grant of fixed subsidies which will not be affected by any fluctuations in the value of the rupee is a matter which will materially influence the success of the proposed new policy. 16. The question of the subsidies to which the shares of His Majesty's Govern ment and the Government of India should be respectively allocated is one on which it is difficult to express an opinion before receiving an indication of the views of the India Office and the Government of India. The tentative suggestion is, however, made that the Government of India should supply all the rupees required, and that their moiety should include the amounts paid to the Sultans of Muscat and Mokalla, the Aden chiefs, the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, and the trucial chiefs, if approved, and half the amounts paid to Ibn Saud and King Hussein, on the ground that these are the chiefs with whom they are most intimately concerned. 17. The further recommendation is made that any balance of the total vote for [5096 ^—41 Csubsidies, accruing at the end of each financial year, should be expended in presents to those chiefs who have done good service, it being understood that such presents should only be made by agreement between the different Departments and Govern ments concerned when the political situation clearly renders it necessary. 18. It has been presumed that none of the recommendations set forth above, if approved, will come into force until the beginning of the next financial year, and the question arises what action is necessary before then to give effect to the decision of the Inter-Departmental Conference, and to prepare the chiefs concerned for the coming change. The case of Ibn Sand demands immediate decision. In the normal course of events this chief would receive 20,000/. during the next four months. In view, however, of the fact that, if the proposals made in this memorandum are in any way approved, his share cannot under the most favourable circumstances exceed 25.000/. per annum, it is suggested that he should at once be informed of the new situation on the lines already indicated, and that, as was done in the case of King Hussein last year, his subsidy should be gradually reduced during the next four months. This could be done by sending him the full amount for December, 4,500/. at the end of January, 3,500/. at the end of February, and 2.500/. at the end of March, making a total of 15,500/. for the next four months. As regards the Idrisi, it is suggested that he should be informed without delay of the fact that His Majesty's Government nave decided to grant him a small subsidy from the 1st April, 1921, and that he should be given an immediate present of 5.000/. in recognition of his loyalty in consulting His Majesty's Government before consenting to the recent proposals of the Ikhwan to attack the Hedjaz from Asir. and in return for the services he has rendered in drawing off Imamic troops which might have been used against the Aden Protectorate. The present attitude of King Hussein does not merit any reward, but it is possible that a new situation may be created if the proposed negotiations with the Emir Feisal prove successful. In such a case, a monetary grant might prove of considerable value, and it is recommended that provisional approval should be given to set aside a sum of 20,000/. to be used if necessary. No special action is necessary as regards the other chiefs. The Sultans of Muscat and Shehr and Mokalla and the Aden chiefs will receive their normal subsidies; the positions of Ibn Rashid and the Imam are not likely to be cleared up within the next few months, while the case of the Sheikh of Koweit, which is still under the consideration of the India Office and the Government of India, is, like those of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the trucial chiefs, of no great urgency. 19. Recapitulation. The decision of the Treasury is required on the following points : (a.) The payment of subsidies in rupees on the basis of a fixed sum representing the permanent value in rupees of the provisional sum of 100,000/. (paragraph 15). (b.) The payment of unexpended balances as presents to chiefs under certain conditions (paragraph 17). (c.) The proposed grant to the Idrisi. (d.) The proposed provisional grant to King Hussein. The decision of the Government of India is required in respect to the payment of a half share of the provisional sum of 100,000/. before any effect can be given to the proposed policy. The opinion of the India Office, in consultation with the Government of India, is required on the following points ;— (a.) The desirability of reducing the subsidy of the Sultan of Muscat (para graph 5). (b.) Grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of Koweit (paragraph 9). (c.) Grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of Bahrein (paragraph 9). (d.) Grant of a subsidy to the trucial chiefs (paragraph 9). (e.) The proportions according to which King Hussein, Ibn Sand, the Idrisi, Ibn Rashid, and Imam Yahya should be subsidised (paragraphs 11-14). (/.) The payment of subsidies in rupees on the basis of a fixed sum representing the permanent value in rupees of the provisional sum of 100,000/. (para graph 15).(^.) The subsidies to which the Government of India should contribute and the proposal that they should provide the rupees required (paragraph 16). (A.) The payment of unexpended balances as presents to chiefs under certain conditions (paragraph 17). (i.) The progressive reduction of the subsidy of Ibn Sand (paragraph 18). K. C.
