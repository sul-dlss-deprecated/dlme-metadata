Proposals for the following facilities are covered by the file: an examination service at Khassab for ships entering the Persian Gulf; a small station on Little Quoin Island; the transferral of a convoy assembly port from Bandar Abbas to Khassab Bay; a small police force at Khor Kuwai; transferral of control of Khor Kuwai to the Royal Air Force for the operation of air-sea rescue craft; permission to fly the flag on Ghanam Island; and the retention of buildings and facilities at Khor Kuwai following the end of the Second World War. Permission for all such facilities required the authority of the Sultan of Muscat, Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] and the correspondence reflects this.Correspondence comes from: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Muscat; the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf; the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq; the Sultan of Muscat and his representatives; and officials at the India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Khor Kuwai</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Naval bases</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000054#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000054#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
