No. 10, dated the 20th January 1889. From— The Residency Agent, Bahrain. To— The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments.-—1 beg to send herewith copy of a letter sent by Jasim bin Thani to the Chief of Bahrain,'with a special messenger, who has also brought a number of other letters giving welcome tidings to Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab, Mujbil and ibn Eedan ; and mentioning the number of people who were slain out of the inhabitants of El-Jowa; viz., 520 persons ; and that they took from them large booty and numerous camels, and that Jasim returned safely with his army. I hear from reports, that Jasim tost 8 men killed. Others say 48, others again 110. But as yet there is no correct report, as since arrival of this messenger, no one has come from El-Katr owing to heavy ' shemall' winds. It is stated that Jasim has not yet reached El-Bida. I hear that Eesau bin Zyab, a cousin of Shaikh Zaeed bin Khaleefah Jbas , arrived at Bahrain from Aboothabee and interviewed the Chief. According to what he says there are not so many people at El-Jowa, and that Shaikh Zaeed had not received any report of Jasim's proceeding from EUKatr to El-Jowa, or any other place. I shall make further reports, when I receive any fresh news. Dated the 13th January 1889. From— Jasim Bin Mohamed Bin Thani. To— Shaikh Eesau Bin Ali, Chief of Babrain, After Compliments. —I am grateful to God for his favours and a succession of his gifts, which are bestowed on those who are of good habits. 1 must communi cate to you the happy tidings of the victory and success which God has favoured us with,' and the disgrace to the evil-doers, and their destruction. When it was reported to me that Zaeed had taken the field, I wanted to meet and encounter him, and when we were abreast of El-Jowa from the east, it became known to us that he had taken refuge in his town, and we entered El-Jowa from the east, and proceeded in a westerly direction, while our men made it their busi ness to plunder, slaughter and burn, right and left as they went along, until they were masters of the whole town. The inhabitants who escaped this slaugh ter took refuge in the fort, which contains two citadels. On the 6th day after our entering El-Jowa we reached the fort. This is the strongest fort in the place. About 120 men were slain in all the districts. When we made a halt before El-Jowa there were about 400 men to defend the fort, and they refused us admission'—our people took it by storm, and all the men were slain—it was impossible to take an account of the slain, notwithstanding that they re peatedly passed by the place. Some of the slaves, who have been captured, state that the men in the fort numbered about 400. The whole town found itself completely destroyed, and enveloped in ruins from east to west, and all its plantations mown down, as if they did not exist the day before. Among the dead were about 15 of the leading men of the Al-bu-Ealah. Our army took possession of all their property, while the women and children fled towards the coast. And we remained there for about 12 days. We used to assemble 12 together fbr our daily prayers, and the ' maazzan' used to call for prayers at the usual hoars and this was the place in which for months and years there used not to be heard the voice of a ' Maazzan' nor did the people meet to gether for prayers. During our long sojourn at the place, we did not find in it even one mosque. When they saw our men doing slaughter among them, each one of them began to call aloud for aid from some one except God, some cried out ' Oh Abdul-Kader'; others, ' Oh Abu-Bahlool.' So it is necessary that we and all the Mussulmans should express our joy and gratitude to the Al mighty, for the destruction of the abode of the tyrannous people, and the efl'acement of all marks of the evil-doers. When some of our people asked them why they remained in the place, notwithstanding our repeated warnings to them, they replied that neither they nor their fore-fathers had heard nor seen in any historical record that any Ruler or Saltan did enter El-Jowa, or did express his hope to that effect. I send you Ahmed bin Majid to convey this happy tiding to you and to give you a verbal account of the affair. I am grateful to God under all circumstances. I hope you are safe, and salaams. Kindly convey my salaams to your family people, brothers and sons of the late Shaikh Ahmed, and to those who feel joyful at the news of our victory. M/sons Khaleefah Thani, Abdullah and Abdul Eahman and our tribesmen send their salaams to you all. We are now at El-Harf and by the middle of the month, we hope in God that everything will be satisfactorily done, and salaams. No. 20, dated Bushire, the 4th February 1889. From—C olonel E. C. Ross, c.s.i .. Political Rfsident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government o£ India, Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honor to inform you that the young Shaikh Ibrahim-Bin-Abdal- lah-Bin Abdallah-Bin Thaneyyan of the Al-Saood or Wahhabee Amir's family lately arrived at Bushire, and called upon me. His. father, Abdallah Pasha, resides in Constantinople, where he enjoys high consideration and is a member of the State Council, though probably poor. This young man came from Constantinople some months ago to Muscat where he remained a short time, and went on to Bahrain where he stayed about two months being treated with courtsey and respect by the chief. He informed me his-chief object in coin- ino' to the Persian Gulf, was to endeavour to effect a reconciliation between Shaikh Jasim Bin Mohamed Thanee and Shaikh Zaeed Bin Khaleefa the Beni Yas Chief. He visited the former in El-Katr, but found him intractable, and he spoke of Jasim as a sort of madman. I attach a memorandum of a more detailed statement which ' Ibn Thaney yan' made to the Residency Confidential Agent. News Report by Confidential Agent, dated the 25th January 1889. 1 had an interview with Ibrahim Bin lhaneyyan, of whom I made enquiries about the object of his coming here from Constantinople. He said the fact is that Jasim, after the quarrel which broke out between him and Shaikh Zaeed resulting in his son being killed, wrote a letter to his (Ibrahim's) father in Constantinople, giving particulars, and requesting him to represent the matter to His Majesty the Sultan. But his father considered it advisable to send Ibrahim to these parts to effect a reconciliation between them. That he first called at Muscat where he remained for a few days, and paid a visit of condol ence to His Highness Syed Feysal and his brothers on their father's death; that then he went to Bahrain where he remained for a few days, then he crossed over to El-Katr and met Jasim and endeavoured repeatedly to bring about peace between him and Shaikh Zaeed; but all ended in failure ; he was obstinate and said that if he could get hold of Zaeed's son, and deliver him to him to be put to death, then he would be satisfied and allow the matter to drop. Finding Jasimobstinate he returned to Bahrain. Jasim after writing to Ibrahim's father did not wait for a reply, &amp;c., but at once wrote to Ibn Rashid asking his aid in the matter. Ibrahim says he will stay for a time here to allow of winter getting a little mild, because at present it is very cold at Constantinople. After a fortnight or so he intends going to Port Said and thence to Constantinople. No. 21, dated Bushire, the 4tli February 1889. From—C olonel E. C.

After Compliments. —I have received a report that about 18 days ago Shaikh Jasim -Bin-Thani started from El-Katr, intending to go to Oman with a large army ; that on this account the Chief of Aboothabee is preparing to march to the interior, and that he has sent messengers to various Bedouin tribes, such as El- Zawahir, A1 Bushamis, Beni Katab, El-Awamir El-daroo and others. He has also sent messengers to the Debay and Ommel-kaiwain chiefs, asking them to meet him in the neighbourhood of Aboothabee, and after they assemble together he will march to encounter Jasim-Bin-Thani. I hear that when the Chief of Abooth abee received news about Jasim's movement, he wanted to send armed men and ammunition by sea to Sil', in view to encounter Jasim, but owing to his fear of the British Government he gave up his idea and decided to march by land. No. 8, dated the 18th January 1889. From—The Officiatiag Residency Agent, Shargah, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —Reports are received from various sources saying that Jasim accompanied by Abdul Rahman Bin Eeysal, and Ibn Sabhan the Deputy of Ibn Rasheed in the districts of, Riadth, and taking a large army with him has arrived at Elzafrah and Leevah, which lie within the territories of the Chief of Aboothabee ; that they massacred the inhabitants and cut down date trees; that their messengers had arrived at Baraimee and interviewed Mohamed-Bin- Ali, the head of the Na'aim tribe, and that Ibn Rasheed will send some soldiers to Jasim's aid. It is reported that the chief of Aboothabee is at a loss what to do as regards the approaching warfare, as he fears the advent of Ibn Rashir' and it is thought that Jasim would not have ventured to come down ^ without tbe assistance of Ibn Rashid. I hear that the Manaseer Bedouins and other dependants of the Chief of Aboothabee and Debay, have come down from the interior to the sea-side, between Jibail and Debay ; that other Bedouins of the interior have also moved to the eastern regions, where there are mountains about Ras-el-Khymah, and to the Eastern States. Under the circumstances the whole of the interior will easily fall into the hands of the western people; the Shaikhs of the Beni 34 Ghafer tribes will have to tender their allegiance, as they are not strong to oppose them, while they are of the same creed as the western people Abdul Ilahman and Ibn Sabhan). enough (Jasim Extract from a note written by the Officiating Residency Agent at Shargah, to Mr. G. Lucas, Assistant Resident, dated the 25th January 1889. I hear that Jasim and some of the western people, Ibn Rashid's men, arrived at Zafrah. They cut down date trees, and slaughtered the inhabitants and carried away their camels. They say their messengers had arrived at Baraimee. These Shaikhs are in a state of great alarm, and they do not know what to do, whether they should meet the western people in a friendly manner or offer them resistance and fight. The Chief of Aboofhabee has not yet left Aboothabee, while his Bedouins have fled and dispersed. So also all the Bedouins from the interior have removed themselves from west to east and they are looking out for places of refuge. While the literal Shaikhs, if they find no one to encourage them and instil martial spirit into their hearts, will not be able to co-operate with one another in view to united action. I hear that His Highness Seyyid Feysal of Muscat has written to the chief of Eas-el-Khymah, asking hitn to place men to guard the various mountain passes, which yield entrance to Batna. In this way they cannot gain their object, unless they act with firmness and full determination, and spend money. The Chiefs of Debay, Shargah, Ajman and Ras-el-Khymah, tell me that the British Government are willing that the western people should take possession of these parts. I replied to them that if Jasim-Bin-Thani is alone concerned, I did not suppose that the British Government will interfere. But if a third party were to interfere, the British Government would not allow its interfer ence on this coast. This appears to be the beginning of disturbances; and God knows the result. No. 22, dated Bushire, the -Uh February 1889. From—Colonel E. C. Ross, c.s.i., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Calcutta.

Further inquiry will be made as to the alleged slaughter of women and child ren on the occasion. No. 16, dated the 27th January 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —With reference to my previous report by the mail steamer, about the slaughter of the dependants of Shaikh Zaeed at El-Jowa and Zafrah. which news was communicated to Shaikh Esau, Chief of Bahrain, by Jasim bin-Mohamed bin-Thani I beg to say that recently some boats have ar rived, from El -Bida and brought some letters. It is said that a large num ber of the Zafrah people were slaughtered but the number did not amount to 520 as mentioned by Jasim. It seems to be less. They said that those in habitants were living in separate huts, scattered among the date plantations, and that they gradually retreated before the army of Jasim, under a fire from Martini-Henri rifles, and entered their fort with their women and children, and closed the door, which they strengthened with rice bags.The fort is only an enclosure, made of bricks, and about 6 to 7 feet high, and it contained two citadels without parapets and loop-holes ; they were all crying out loudly, and begging Jasim to grant them safety of their 'lives, but they heard them not. They then told them to evacuate the fort under Jasim's protection. Some of them came out of the fort and tbey fired a volley on them and charged them, killing them with their women and children. About 12 men of Jasim's party were slain, and some men were wounded. They then carried away slaves and other booty. They further state that a report was received at El-Bida that Shaikh Zaeed has left Aboothabee accompanied by the inhabitants of Debay and intends to proceed to El-Katr. No. 34, dated Bushire, the 18th February 1889. From—Colonel E. C. Ross, c.s.i., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honor to. enclose a translation of a remarkable and interesting letter written in June last by Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mohammed Thani of El-Katr to Abdallah Pasha-ibn Thaneyyan of the Al-Suood family of Nejd who now resides at Constantinople and is understood to be a Member of the Council of State at that capital. 2. I obtained a copy of Shaikh Jasim's letter from Ibrahim the son of ra.«, Jeter No. 20, d. te d «h Febm.^ 1889. ^Mallah Pasha under promise of secrecy, and I am assured by him that his father took no steps to place Shaikh Jasim's views and requests before the Sukan or the Minister of the Porte. It is however, highly probable that Jasim used other channels to endeavour to persuade the Turkish Government to adopt or favour his schemes, which now stand fully revealed so far as he is concerned, as the letter is undoubtedly genuine. 3. Unaided and unsupported it is not in the power of Jasim to undertake the conquest of any districts of Oman. Desultory raids are the utmost in his^ power and the Beni Yas tribesmen are more than a match for Jasim's following. He, however, followed up his appeal to the Turkish Government, by a similar appeal to ' Ibn Hashid ' whose power is now paramount in Central Nejd, as well as in the North-Western Provinces of Arabia; and apparently it is only some unforeseen circumstances that have delayed a movement from Nejd on Oman. 4. It may be assumsd as certain that the Turkish authorities and Govern ment have been fully informed of these matters and it seems more clear than ever that it depends on the attitude of the Porte whether or not any serious invasion of Oman is undertaken. It is very probable that ' Ibn Rashid- ' is (as reported) awaiting a reply from the Porte before moving. Anyhow a respite, at least, has been accorded, and I would venture to suggest that advantage should be taken of the delay, to consider our relations with the Turk's and Arabs on the Katr coast, in view if possible, to some understanding with the Turkish Government, which would put a stop to the dangerous border warfare now going on and prevent the possibility of any extensive aggression on the 'Oman provinces. A friendly feeling between the Turks and ourselves in the Persian Gulf would, I think, be mutually advantageous and might perhaps be obtained by a spontaneous recognition under certain conditions of their de yacito position on the Katr coast which would also enable the British Government to hold the Porte more fully responsible for any attempted encroachments oil the Oman territories. To His August Highness Abdullah Pasha Ibn-Thajteyyan Al^uod^ dated 28th Ramadthan. 1305 A. June Ib88. After compliments. enquiries about your health, I beg to inform you (and may you hear naught but good), that during this long period I have always remembered you although you are distant from us and there has been &amp;no correspondence between us; but friendship for you is deeply rooted m my heart and distance only increases and confirms it: when love is rooted m hearts, distance only increases it especially the love of human beings for their fellow creatures. I am confident that your soiourn in those parts, where you are, is beneficial to us. Although I do not trouble you, I am certain that if any reports are received about me there, you will make up for my absence, and do better for me than if I were present, although I do not give you particulars. At present a mishap has befallen me, which has compelled me to inform you about it, and I solicit God's aid, then yours; and I have good hopes m God and you; and God willing through you and your generous aid I shall gain my object, to wit; since the high Government (Turkish) took possession of the district of Nejd, myself and my followers have been obedient to it, and have given our allegiance to it and have served it without any recompense while other people are not so, they do not serve unless they are paid. In particular, as to myself, during all this time I have been Kaim Makam of the District of Katr, and have set aside all my own affairs, and have attended to the service of the high Government, I have never asked for any salary and have used my best endeavours in the service of the Government and for the benefit of the creed. * As regards Oman, you are well aware . Attention is drawn to tills passage. &lt;* ite condition and the income which Can e .c. r . te obtained from it and that this territory and its inhabitants are subject to the Government of Nejd.* Ever since Govern ment (Turkish) took possession of Nejd, Oman has been left to itself, no one has taken notice of it, and each township has remained in the hands of its inhabit ants. It is not hidden from you that Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah is one of the inhabit ants of Oman, and he was the first man to pay taxes to you, the Al-Suood. When the Government reduced the power of the Al-suood, and paid no attention to Oman, the above Zaeed rose and began to follow his inclination and created dissensions amongst the people until he acquired paramount power, and be came their master, and seized all the revenues. He oppressed the people and tyrannized over them, while the people were powerless and could not resist him, except by the aid of God and the high (Turkish) Government: and this after the justice and good treatment they experienced from the Al-Suood. But the Government neglected them, and left them out, as if they were not subject to the Government of Nejd. Then some of the inhabitants of the town and villages came to me seeking my aid and soliciting that I should use my endeavours for them with the Government and arrange that they nn'ght be rid of the jurisdiction of Zaeed- bin-Khaleefah over them, and that the Government may include the territories within the district and jurisdiction of Nejd, as of yore, so that the inhabitants may find peace and rest and be safe against murders and plunder, and be rid of this person, who fears not God, and knows not His wrath. I gave them good promises and full hopes, and I represented this matter to every Wali and Mutaserrif who came to these parts,! and they used to give me fair promises, and in turn 1 used to give similar promises —The Wah8 0f BU8rah &amp; Governor of to the inhabitants who used to become joyful and hope for relief from God ai^l the merciful Government. But months and years rolled away, and there was no result, and the Government were quite neglectful, which was not proper, as those people were their subjects and included within the jurisdiction of the Government of Nejd. The revenues of Oman equal those of Nejd, perhaps they are greaterespecially if it comes in the JN,B - hands of the high Government.! 'When Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah came to know about my counsel and endeavours with the officers of the Government, he harboured in his mind animosity against me and ,instigated the tribes under his orders, who began to raid our neighbour hood, plunder our property, murder our men, outrage our women, and make slaves of our free people, but since we are dependants of the high Government, I could not do anything, and prevented my tribesmen from committing any7 outrages on him* (Zaeed) or his tribesmen, and I hoped that the Government • F»r from true. f 0ul&lt; * ^dress onr wrongs and punish ..... him tor his violent deeds. And what ever humiliation we have suffered at his hands, and whatever outrage he has done to us, I have complained about the same to the officials of the Govern ment who have been in these parts, and they have given us fair promises and fed us on strong hopes up to date, but no result has followed. On this account when Zaeed found no opposition from the Government, nor any rebuke, he held the Government in contempt and thought that the High Government had no sense of honor and was neglectful of her territories which she would not render secure nor protect her subjects, he longed to seize Katr and its districts and include them in Omanf; accordingly he prepared t This is absurd. an arm y un der his son Khaleefah and brother-in-law, Mohamed-bin-Saif, and des patched them to seize the town of Katr, while we and the inhabitants were in safety and protection of God and the High Government, and we never thought that he would dare to this extent, nay even a great power would not have dared to act thus against a town under the protection of the flag of the High Government and we were all away from the town of El-Katr, and my son Ali and some other inhabitants only were in the town. They attacked them about the time of morning prayer, on the 18th RamadthanJ 1305 A. t 30th May 1888. ^ an( * ^7 ^ere taken unawares. They • ,. , . Se ^ up an uproar, and whoever came out oi his house in response to the call, was slain in front of the door of his • house, and God so decreed that Ali my son was among those who were slam, there were fifty other leading men of the town slain, and an equal number or perhaps more, wounded. The messenger brought this news to us after some time. When they heard that our towns people were about to re- caive reinforcements they plundered what they could, and returned. And I and my tribesmen arrived after the whole thing was over, (as decreed by God), and the enemy had departed. We wanted to pursue them, so that God might grant us revenge, but we feared to undertake any thing previous to referring the matter to Government, which might not approve our proceedings.§ So we § This is an artful colouring. trusted in God and made no hurry, pend- iug reference of the matter to the High Government. Indeed this daring act of Zaeed is derogatory to the Govern ment, because I am her servant and under her protection, though before we came to place ourselves under the Government protection he had power to act m this daring manner. So if the Government be moved by the sense of its honor, and guard its sublime position against insult, all well: if not let it shut its eyes against our acts, and give us permission to act against Zaeed, and the territories of Oman. And if I seize him then both I and he will be at the orders of God and the Government. My sense of honor has been moved in view to se- cure and keep intact the respect and honor of the High Government and do things which are beneficial to its interests. Because securing the territory of Oman and including it to her within the jurisdiction of Nejdasit was before, will add the name and honor of the Government, and will prove beneficial her Treasury. But the Government is neglectful of this, and I do not know whether this neglect emanates from herself or that the high officials do not report these mat ters to the Government, in a correct manner. May you for ever continue to be the ornament, enjoying high position and honors, and ever-lasting relic of the renowned families of Arab. I consider your and my condition as the same ; anythmg adding to my honor, I believe, will give you pleasure in the same way that increase of your honor gives me pleasure. Any loss, is a loss to all of us. 'With full hopes in you, I have been induce- ed to communicate the matter to you and give all details. I know that, thanks to God, your advice is accepted by the Government. I hope therefore you will re present the matter to the Sultan, and by the favor of God I hope our object will v Tv^ 1 * 0 1 ? lus ^ k 0 . one ^ wo things, i .e., that the Government will under take the task of seizing Oman, and we shall give our aid in the matter in everywav Or we solicit that the Government may permit us to seize the territory S secure it. By the grace and aid of God and the High Government, I hope ?o subdue the territories and release the inhabitants from their miserableposition and they will pray for the prosperity of the sublime Government. After this if the Government should desire that I should hold charge of it, paying the reve nues to the Government, or that they wish to take charge of it themselves, they will be free to choose.

Please write to me always, giving news of your welfare, and let me know anvthing you wish to be done here, and kinly convey my salams to Ibrahim ^ 6 . . and his brothers. My sons also send Sa nson of Abdullah Pasha. i ams to you. May you ever remain under God's protection, and may peace and divine blessings rest on you. Postscript of Jasim's letter to Abdullah Pasha Ibn Thaneyyan, dated 28th Ramadthan 1S05, corresponding to 9th June 1888. I beo* to inform you (may you not know except what is good) that I have written to you a letter and have given you details in it, which need not be re peated here. I place my dependence on God and you, and I trust m God that my hopes will not meet disappointment, and I have refrained from taking any action about matters which come upon us one after the other, and I cannot give my attention to them until I hear from vou. If I receive sufficient support and iustice from the sublime Government, this is what is required, and we shall 30m the Government and aid her in the undertaking; otherwise the Government should grant us permission to secure the districts of Oman. If it is necessary to write out memorials or send telegrams, or similar things, in connection with ex penses to be met, you will kindly let me know your, opinion, and the reply may be given according to the circumstances, and I shall act accordingly, because you know better than us all the ways and rules, and what pleases you, and the directions you give us, shall be final and obeyed. We shall be much obliged to you, and God will reward you for gaining this result, and God willing, you will gain greater honours and superiority over others of your kind. You will have your reward in the world to come. As it is mentioned in the traditions of Moha- med, (may God's grace and peace be on him), the believers are like a building in which one part gives support and strength to the other, further the believers are like unto a body, when one member of the .body suffers pain, then the whole body becomes feverish and suffers from want of sleep. It is further laid down that no one can be a true believer unless he should wish the same for his Moslim brother as he would have done unto himself. God knows that my belief is that what pains me pains you, and that a strong friendship exists between us. I trust therefore in your worthy self and great friendship, that you will kindly let me know of the arrival of my letter to you, by a telegram, to the care of Jaji Ibrahim Bin Mandeel at Busrah, and you will kindly give me some hint in it about the nature of the reply and other details which I may expect to receive by your letter. You will kindly send your letter under registered cover via Bahrain, and to the care of Mujbil Ez- Zakair, and that you will give me full details in that letter, and salams.

I have the honour to submit translations of news reports received from No. 12, dated sist January 1889. the Residency Agent at Shargah, on the No. 14, dated 7th February 1889. subject principally of the hostilities he* tween the Chief of Ahu-Dhahee and Shaikh Jasim Bin Mohammad Thani. No. 12, dated the 31st January 1889. News Report by the Residency Agent, Shargah. On the 17th January 1889, the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah arrived by land at Shargah on a visit to the Chief. From the 13th to 24ith January and 26th to 31st idem there has been a very copious fall of rain and heavy winds prevailed in these parts, and all communi cations by sea were stopped. According to reports of Thani Bin 'Ataish, who has come to Pebay from Si!*,,and whose Mashoa also was employed in taking provisions to Kufareeyah, the expeditionary force of Jasim Bin Thani consists of (1) the Na'ain tribesmen, who are friends of the Shaiks of Bahrain, mz., Naser Bin Jabar and Rashed Bin Jabar; they have about 50 horsemen, (2) the Ma'atheed tribesmen of Jasim, (3) the Beni Hajir, (4) some camelmen and 20 horsemen of the A1 Nurrah, (5j about 25 camelmen of the Bu-Ainaim, (6) about seven camelmen of the Al-Bukawara, and about 70 camelmen of the Manaseer, under Hamaid Bin Mana 5 , who were before subject to the Chief of Abu-Thabee, and about 100 camelmen belonging to the Mahanidah, El-Mazaree, A1 Musallum, El Ama- marah, El-Chabsah, and El-Masallatah. The total number is above 1,000 camelmen. It is reported that a small number of the Manaseer and El-Mazaree, who owned date plantations at Leevah, had fortified themselves in the Fort of Leevah, and Jasim wanted to seize the Fort; an assault was made, and during the engagement about 50 men of Jasim's party were killed and Jasim's party suffered defeat. Then Hamid Bin Mana El-Mansoori took promise of safety from Jasim to the people who were in possession of the Fort of Leevah; on this the Manaseer descended from the Fort and then Jasim's men made a second attack and took possession of the Fort, and slaughtered about 25 men of the Mazaree tribe who were in the Fort. They took some prisoners and pulled down the walls of the Fort. The above is a report obtained from Muhammad Bin Saef, a brother-in- law of Shaikh Zaeed Bin Khaleefah, while he was at Debay.No. 14, dated Shargah, the 7th February 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Shargah, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. M ohammad B in S aef , a brother-in-law of the Chief of Abti -Dhabee visited Debay, Shargah, Ajman and Ommel-Kaiwan ; he had letters from the Chief of Aboothabee to the Chiefs of the above principalities, and he wanted the Chiefs to aid him and co-operate with him in his warfare with Jasim Bin Thani. It appears that with the exception of the Chief of Debay no other Chief will join the Aboothabee Chief in his undertaking. I hear that the Chief of Eebay is preparing to start, and that the Chief of Aboothabee will proceed by sea- to Khore Ghanazah, and meet inland with the Chief of Debay at the encamp ments of the Manaseer, the Mazaree and others, who have transferred them selves from the western districts to the neighbourhood of Debay. Mohammad Bin Saef has pro'ceeded from Ommel-Kaiwan to the Bedouins in the interior, such as the Beni Katab, El-Ghafalah, El-Amamir, El-Daroo and others, who are allied with the Chief of Aboothabee, and whom he has asked to aid him against Jasim Bin Thani. , I hear that the Chief of Aboothabee, his sons, his brother and the elders of the Al-bu-faMh, together with the elders of the Al-bu-falasah of Debay, will proceed to Katr, and will not return until they have accomplished their object. I find that the previous report of the arrival of Abdul Rahman Bin Peysal and Ibn Sabhan, and their joining Jasim Bin Thani, had no foundation. I think the Chief of Aboothabee will send some of his men by sea to Sil', and horses and camels by land to that port, and thence they will proceed towards El-Katr. I hear this from the private conversation of people in Debay, and they argue that Jasim Bin Thani sends provisions and warlike materials by sea to the places within the jurisdiction of the Chief of Aboothabee ; and say how is it that the Aboothabee Chief cannot send the same within his own limits ? The. above is the news I have heard, and which I submit for your information. .No. 41, dated Bushire, the 1st March 1889, From—Colonel E.

I have the honor to enclose translations of news-letters received from the No. 22. dated 13th February 1889. Residency Agent at Bahrain, regarding ' Ig, 20th the hostilities between Shaikh Jasim-bin- Mohamed Thani and the Aboothabee Chief. No. 22, dated the 13th February 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain. To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Jfter Compliments, —With reference to the previous report about the slaughter of the dependants of Shaikh Zaeed at El-Zafrah by Jasim-bin-Thani's party, there appears to be some discrepancy about the numbers slain. Abu Ghareb, one of the Na'ain tribe who was with Jasim in this expedition, states the number of slain may have amounted to about 100 person's, including adults, old men, women, children, and the blind; and that Jasim would not accept any one^s intercession, contrary to the custom of the Arabs; whilst Jasim. lost about 18 men killed and 13 wounded. Arrivals from Aboothabee report that Shaikh Zaeed has learned that about 70 of his dependants were slain, and that Jasim's party lost about 45 men, that Shaikh Zaeed has sent word to all the tribesmen dependent on him to 1020 \ 11 join him in view to proceeding to El-Katr; he did not go out to meet Jasim, because they were uudet the impression that Jasim would not go as far as El- Zafrah without the presence of Ibn Rashid, and they further thought that there were only few men at that place. Arrivals from El-Bida report that Jasim has erected towers around El- Bida for protection, and that the people of Wakrah have rebuilt the town wall, as they all fear Shaikh Zaeed. The Bedouins of Jasim have for the present gone to their houses ; but it is said that in the event of Shaikh Zaeed attacking El-Katr, they can muster about four to five thousand fighting men. No doubt they will meet him (Zaeed) before he reaches the town. It is said that the Turkish soldiers will protect the town and the watering place-at Na'aijah. There is a common report that Shaikh Zaeed wants money and arms. The above Abu-Ghareb says that if five hundred of Shaikh Zaeed's party or even less number had attacked them (Jasim's party), they would have been totally ' destroyed. They returned from the place greatly fatigued: No. 28, dated the 14th February 1889. From—The Residency Agent; Bahrain. To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

They daily receive false alarms, and they go out of the town and then come back. The Turkish soldiers are also said to have moved out to Ma'aijah, the watering place about 3 miles distant from the town. They have taken with them ammunition, and if an attack is made they will fight; that Jasim has been giving them money and rice as a bribe to make them fight against Shaikh Zaeed's party. But according to their regulations they will not proceed inland beyond this limit, unless Jasim forces them, and gives them a written order under his seal, bebause he is a Kaem Makam, or deceitfully induces the commandant to do so. It is reported that Shaikh Zaeed moved out of Aboothabee, bound for El-Katr. No. 26, dated the 20th February 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain. To-—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —Arrivals from El-Bida report that all the inhabitants of the El-Katr ditricts are in great fear of Shaikh Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah, and the inhabitants of El-Bida are engaged in building towers around the town, and they intend to build a wall also. They have devoted their full attention to these defensive measures and have given up their ordinary business transactions. The. people of Wakrah have repaired the towers and their town wall, and the Tur-^ kish soldiers have built defensive works along the path leading to the watering place Na'aijah, where they have a fort and a tower. It appears they in tend to defend this spot against their enemy. I hear that Jasim has sent a special man with letters to Ba^ra and Kowait, but his object has not transpired. Intelligence is received that Shaikh Zaeed has moved out of Aboothabee, and is collecting an army, and that the people of Debay and other territories and Bedou ins have joined him. It is said that in the event of Shaikh Zaeed proceeding to attack them they will go out of the town and meet him at some, distance frortt. the town.No. 47, dated Busliire, the 8th March 1889.

After Compliments. —On the 15th Eehraary Sheikh Zaeed Bin Khaleefa Chief of Abu Dhabee and Shaikh Rashid Bin Maktum, .Chief of Debay met at Khor Ghanaza to consult. It was agreed that on the 25th February the Chief of Debay with the A1 Bu Filasa and all their camel-men and horsemen should go to Sameh, and there meet the Chief of Abu Dhabee with his sons and relations and the A1 Bu Filah with all their camel-men and horseman; and that the two chiefs should collect all their Bedouins and proceed to' Guttar. The people of Abu Dhahee are making preparations to go, and are buying munitions of war, provisions and camels; and there are now ready at Abu Dhahee 2,000 Abu Dhabee and Leeva horsemen. 'Jhese people are very enraged with Sheikh Jasim Bin Thani for having killed women and children. The people of Ahu Dhabee blame Sheikh Zaeed for having withdrawn men from Leeva to Abu Dhabee. It seems clear to me that Sheikh Zaeed's intention is not to return from Guttar until he has taken revenge, or he and all the men with him are killed. This is a most difficult matter. I have heard that in a short time 5,000 horsemen will be collected at Ahu Dhahee. Sheikh Zaeed does not wish to take with him any men on foot. He has given notice to all the chiefs of the Beni Ghafir to aid him, and has told them that if they fail to do so, he will not interfere if they have trouble with the Manaseer hereafter. I report what I have heard. No. 19, dated the 19th February 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Shargah, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —'When I arrived at Abu Dhabee, I enquired the par ticulars of Sheikh Jasim Bin Thani's attack on Ghafra. Two of the A1 Mazari, Juma' Bin Saif and Khalaf Bin Ghais, were at Ghafra, and Humeyd Bin Mana' Mansuri spared them and let them go. These two men say that when Sheikh Jasim approached the fort called ' Khanur ' the fight began, and many on Jasim's side were killed and pounded. There were in the fort SO men of Leeva, viz., old men and the people who look after the date trees, for the Chief of Abu Dhahee had withdrawn all the fighting-men from Leeva to Abu Dhabee. Humeyd Bin Mana Mansuri came up to the fort, and called out that Sheikh Jasim would spare any Manaseer who were inside, and who would come out: thereupon 30 men of the AJ. Majari went out, and these had no gunpowder or bullets, and they said that they were Manaseer, and Humeyd did not know that they were not so. Afterwards the Beni Ha jar went to Jasim and asked him to spare the rest of the people in the fort, hut Jasim got very angry and said that he had spent much money in getting there, and since his arrival one had asked him to spare some, and another had asked him to spare others. He then ordered the people of Guttar to attack the fort at once, and the Beni Hajar and other isedoums did so, and making a breach in the wall of the fort, entered it, and13 killed 45 mon ; the A1 Sudan spared S men, but Jnsim afterwards ordered his slaves to kill them. Subsequently Jasim ordered the people of. Guitar to kill any children they migl-.t find, and they killed 30, the eldest of whom may have been 5 years of age ; they also killed 18 women who tried to save their children. The Bedouins with Jasim cried out much and represented that no Arab had ever done such a thing as kill women and children, but Jasim did not listen to them. The Bedouins did not kill any women or children, or those men who gave up th ir arms; they killed only those who fought. Jasim captured 30 Freed slaves and 30 camels, and 40 camels were killed in the fight round the forfc.

It SCCmS bej^Ond doubt that in his 25th February 1889. raid Shaikh Jasim was guilty of atro cious cruelties rarely committed by the most uncivilized Arab tribes. The feeling on both sides is so intensely bitter that no ordinary mediation would avail to effect a truce, and the warfare is likely to assume more serious propor tions and aspects. 3. The only way of restoring peace, appears to me to be some joint action of British and Turkish authorities; and this can only take place if Turkish juris diction at El-Bida is recognized. 4.

I heard that these people had built a fortified place, and having besought aid of God I attacked them, and obtained entrance into their refuge; and in that place was collected all the property which these peoplehad looted at sea and on land, nobody had been able to take this place or to capture these men, but God aided me against them. These Bedouins are oppressors, and the villagers are worse. When God gave me aid against these people, and broke them, and killed those whom it pleased him, I was glad to give you tidings thereof, for they are robbers by sea and on land.

These men begged mercy from my informant, and when they were brought before Jasim, begged mercy from himalso. Jasim, however, would not listen, and ordered that their throats should be cut.

Jasim, who came to El-Bida, and having assembled all the men there distributed arms and ammunition amongst them ; that the men numbered over 2,000, and Jasim went with them to a place called Misemir (where there is water) between Al-Wakra and El-Bida, ' Others say that Zaeed-bin-Khalifah has reached Al-Sala ; others again, that Jasim has received a letter from Shargah. in which he is informed that Sheikh Zaeed had left and was on his way with the Chief of Debay to attack Guttar. It may be that the Chief of Shargah sent this letter, for I hear that he is not friendly towards Zaeed. It is said that R ishid-bin M iktum. Chief of Debay, has announced to Jasim that he will not act in alliance with him, to which Jasim replied ' who and what are you.' The Kazi of Guttar, having b( ea relieved of his post, arrived here to-day, and he says that Guttar is in a most disquieted state, that the people are in srreat fear : and that when Zaeed comes, the Turkish soldiers will only guard the water at Na'ija. That there is new no ill-feeling between Jasim and the Turkish soldiers, but that Jasim is always tr 'acherous. I have heard that when Jasim was going to Leeva and Ghafra, h 5 gave some money to the Commandant of the Turkish soldiers, and asked him to let him X6Soii- have a trumpet ami 2 men for the purpose of frightening the people of Oman, but that the Commandant refused.

From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. 4/ter Compliments. —The latest news about Katr is that the Naeem have advised Jasim-bin-lhani to shift from Meeseymeer to Meesheyreeb near Bida, on the ground that the former place is about 2 hours distance from Bida while the latter is only 5 minutes. It appears that Jasim has acquiesced in their suggestion. The Naeem have represented to him that the main force of Zaeed's army will be concentrated on Bida, and that if Jasim finds the enemy too strong to cope w r ith it in an open field, he can then easily battle the enemy from within the fort, by removing his force into it. While at Messeymeer, Jasim sent for some Turkish soldiers who went to him and returned. His object is to sound them as to whether they will join him in the coning struggle. The people at Katr believe as certain that Zaeed has already commenced his march towards Katr with 1,500 men, so Jasim has despatched spies in all directions to watch the approach of the enemy. The rumour is that Jasim has with him about 4,000 men, and 200 horsemen, besides some Turkish sol diers and a portion of the Naeem, the mercenaries of the Sheikh of Bahrain; and the impression is that Jasim's men will fight to the last. But the majority are of the opinion lhat his men are not willing to fight, but that they have been compelled to take up arms. It is also said that the Turkish soldiers will not leave their fort, but others again think that in case of an emergency they might come out and go to Nayjah to protect the wells'. Nayjah is more distant from Bida than Meesheyreeb. Owing to strong shammal, no one has come from Katr with news from that place. No. 88, dated Bushire, the 15th April 1889. From— Colonel E. C.

I have the honor to forward translations of further reports noted on the No. 52. dated 28th March 1889. margin, received from the Residency Agent 58, „ ioth April 1889. at Bahrain, regarding the impending en- ' 69 ' ' llth D0, counter between Shaikh Jasim and Shaikh Zaeed of Abu Thabee. No. 52, dated the 28th March 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. A man by name Mulhan-al-Hassawee has arrived here to-day from Katr and has brought the following intelligence. It is 8 days, he says, since he left 1718 El-Bida, and he reports that at the time of his departure from there he heard that the spies despatched by Jasim had arrived at that place, and that Shaikh Zaeed had arrived near about. That Jasim had solicited the aid of the Turkish soldiers at El-Bida and that they were preparing to go to join him. That Jasim at the head of his force had arrived at a place called Sehaleeya about I3 hollrs , distance from El-Bida. That Jasim has settled his difference with the Turkish soldiers who had now placed themselves under his orders. That he had given them 100 bags of rice and 50 Kerosine oil tins filled with ghee. Mulham is of opinion that if the Turkish soldiers actually join Jasim in an attack against Zaeed, they are sure to defeat the latter as they are disciplined troops. Mulham also reports that Naeefa a messenger from Tbn Rashid has landed at Mattrah, a village in Hassa, With letters to Jasim and a present of 2 marea and 3 camels, and that Jasim has informed his troops that the reinforcement from Ibn Rashid will arrive within the next two days, and that the Al-Murrah will also lend their aid to him. I am however of opinion that these promises of help which Jasim is hold ing out to his troops are only intended to encourage them. I have seen a letter from Jasim to Mujbil in which the writer says that he is prepared to meet Zaeed and that he is not afraid of his advance; on the con trary that he will himself march out to attack Zaeed incase the latter should not advance against him. In that letter he also wishes Mujbil to believe that Ibn Rashid will not fail to fulfil his promise. The date of this letter is 17tb March. It is apparent that Jasim wrote that letter before the arrival of Naeefa. My own opinion fs that if the news about Zaeed's advance be true, and also that if Jasim be supported by the Turkish soldiers, Zaeed's forces will- have hard work before them ; for Jasim is regardless of expense and the Tur kish soldiers are greedy, as is known. Their number at El-Bida is 260. No. 58, dated the 10th April 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —News has reached Bahrain that Jasim bin Thani has marched from Messeymeer to Moosheyrib near Bida. I think that he has taken this step by the advice of the Turkish soldiers as it was not possible for them to join him at Messeymeer which is distant from Bida about 4 hours. Their official instructions are that they should defend the town and its suburbs, and they are bound to defend the water wells at Nayija at all events, upon the supply of which the inhabitants depend, for the ^ater of Messheyrib is brackish besides being scanty. The distance between Bida and Nayija is about 15 or 20 minutes. It is reported that it is the intention of Jasim on the arrival of Zaeed, to find out the strength of the enemy before risking an engagement; and in the event ofthe enemy being too strong for him to venture upon an open engagement with them, to order his troops to retire into the town ; and request the Turkish soldiers to open fire upon the enemy from the fort if they come near Nayija. If he finds them weak, and his own men steady and reliable, to go out to meet the enemy. Nothing is yet known about Zaeed's movements towards Katr as no one has come here from Bida this week. Some Bedouins belonging to the tribe of Naeem have arrived here from Roowayis and Abu DthoJoof. They have hired some boats for the purpose of removing themselves and families to Bahrain together with all their moveables. They have been advised to do so by the people of El-Bida. It is supposed that this step hasbeen taken by the Naeem from fear of Zaeed bin Khalifah who they expect will detach some parties against them for the purpose of plundering and slaughtering them.2o£ No. 59, dated lltli April 1889. From—The Residency Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —Last night Muhammed bin Abdul Wabab arrived in Bahrain and was the guest of the Chief, and I hear that they held some secret conversation that night. Next morning Abdul Wahab came to Manamah, and he hired a boat which he intends to despatch to Bida to-night, I do not know on what errand, to Jasim, it may be that he may have some communication to make to Jasim from his own part, or that the Chief of Bahrain may have commissioned him to send some message to Jasim. No one comes to know what passes between the Chief of Bahrain and Abdul Wahab; but a banian by name Akoo informs me that Shaikh Esa is going to send a letter in that boat. Before the arrival of Abdul Wahab Muhammed bin Khatr and Sultan bin Salamah had an interview with the Chief of Bahrain and suggested to him that he should mediate between Jasim and Zaeed with a view to making peace be tween them. But the Chief replied to them that none of them had given him the slightest hint about reconciliation. I met Abdul Wahab to-day who says that the object of Jasim in entering Moosheyrib and Bida is to avoid dispersion of his troops which he feared would take place had he remained in Messeymeer, as the majority of his men are not submissive to him. Once they are in Bida they will not be able to disperse. It is probably Jasim's intention, if Zaeed comes near Nayija, to despatch Turkish soldiers in front and his other troops in rear. He is afraid that, if his Katr troops enter alone into an engagement with the enemy, they will betray him and go over to the enemy ; for they have mostly been forced to enlist themselves for the pending battle. It is not known yet whether Zaeed has arrived at Katr. Should Jasim find the enemy too strong he will retire into the town which is surrounded by a wall: and open fire at the enemy from within. In that case Zaeed will not be able to come near. No. 89, dated Bushire, the 15th April 1889. From— C olonel E. C.

No. 35, dated the 23rd March 1889, From—The Residency Agent, Shargah, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. After Compliments. —I have heard that the Chief of Kishm had arrived on a visit to the Chief of TJm-el-Kawain, bringing with him a present of a horse to the latter, and that after a stay of 7 days he had returned to his place. 20th March. —The Chief of Abu-Thabee has started from Sameya to- wards Katr. 21st March. —Maktoon Bin Hashir, Batee Bin Suheyl &amp; Abdullah Bin Harj, the Shaikhs of Al-bu-Elassah have left to join him with 800 camelmen 1920 and 25 horsemen, and it is said that the tribe of Beni-Katab will also join him. I have heard that the sons of Ghusn Bin Sinaan have already joined him with 400 camelmen and 16 horsemen; and that the tribes of Al- dowahar, Al-awamir and Al-duro intend to join him at Seykhah, a place within 5 day's journey of Katr. As the force which he intends to bring in the field will be very large, and there is no sufficient quantity of water along the line of march, the Chief of Abu-Thabee is despatching his troops by detachments to Dubeykhah the place appointed for the rendezvous. The number of troops at present under his command is estimated at .5,000 camelmen and 200 horsemen. The Chief of Debay has not joined the expedition in person at the express desire of the Abu-Thabee Chief. Shaikh Diyah Bin Khalifah has been appointed locum tenens of the Chief of Abu-Thabee during the latter's absence. The Chief of Abu-Thabee has written a letter to the Chief of IJm-el-Kawain urging him to join the expedition. In an interview I had with the latter chief, he explained to me that there was no alliance between himself and the Chief of Abu-Thabee of an offensive and defensive nature, and that the call he had received was instigated by the Chief of Debay with the object of breaking up the friendship which existed between the Chief of Abu-Thabee and him (Chief of Um-el-Kawain). He further explained to me that the ill-will which the Chief of Debay bore towards him was the outcome of a dispute which arose between them regarding a certain pearl. This pearl was sold at Debay for a low price by pearl-fishers from Um-el-Kawain. On his be coming aware of it the Chief of Um-el-Kawain demanded the restoration of. the same on behalf of his subj.ects, which was however refused. Hence the ill-feeling between the two chiefs. Since that occurrence, the intercourse between the two places has been stopped. I have seen a letter addressed by Jasim Bin Thani to the Chief of Um-el-Kawain, in which the writer, appealing to the religious feelings of his co-religionist, impresses upon the latter the necessity of his ren dering him help, and expresses his assurance that he will 'not help his antagonist against him. There is now no friendship between Shaikh Zaeed and the Chiefs all along the coast from Shargah to Ras-el-Kheymah. A fight has taken place between the two sections of the Naeem, Al-Bu- khereyban and Al-bu-shamis. On the 23rd March the Chief of Ajman accom panied by 100 camelmen went to mediate between them. The Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman have entered into a treaty of neutrality. The initiative was taken by the Chief of Shargah who despatched as his ambas sador, Sultan Bin Aweis, the Chief 'of Hojrah, to the Chief of Ajman, who in his turn despatched to Shargah, on his behalf, Hamdan Bin E^shid the Shaikh of Naeem. The Chiefs of Ajman and Um-el-Kawain have also, I hear, conclud ed a treaty of neutrality. Two months ago Shaikh Salim Bin Sultan married his cousin, the daughter of the Chief of Ajman. Shaikh Ibrahim bin Sultan has arrived at Shargah on a visit to the Chief. A man by name Rashid has arrived at Um-el-Kawam bringing letters from the Chief of Bahrain to the Chief of Abu-Thabee. It appears that the Chief of Bahrain has asked the Chief of Abu-Thabeo not to wreak his veno-eance on the Naeem who were with Jasim at the time when the attack on Leeva was directed. Ahmed bin Seif Al-Astanee has despatched 10 earthen vessels filled with gunpowder to Jasim Bin Thani by a special boat. I have received this news from a trustworthy person who was present at their landing.21 List of Enclosures in Despatch No. 74, (J^-J dated the Mth May 188% from the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, to Mer Majesty's Secretary of State for India.

The, present state of affairs, however, is not satisfactory, and it is of so much importance to prevent the spread of disorder among the Trucial Chiefs and towards Oman, that we hope Her Majesty's Government may find it possible to take some effective steps in the matter.

Translation of a letter from the Residency Agent at Bahrain, No. 60, dated the 15th April 1889, A boat has arrived here from Bidaa bringing 15 Turkish soldiers who are on their way to Busrah. Letters brought by that boat say that Zaid has not yet arrived on the frontiers of Katr, but it appears that Jasim is encamped with his troops, consisting of towns-people and Bedouins, round about Bidaa. Some say that Jasim's forces number over three thousand men besides the-Tur kish troops, but others again put it down to two thousand only. The Turkish soldiers who arrived at Bahrain praise much the equipment of Jasim's army, which, they say, is supplied with Martini rifles. They say the Turkish soldiers stationed at Bidaa will follow Jasim as far as Kaijah. They also mention that Zaid wrote to the Turkish Commandant at Bidaa asking him not to interfere in the pending encounter, as he (Zaid) was not going to ad vance against the town where the Turkish troops are stationed. It appears that Zaid even promised the Commandant to supply him and his soldiers with all the necessary provisions in the shape of water, firewood, &amp;c., which is usual ly obtained from the outlying villages, if he remained neutral. But the Commandant appears to have refused such a. proposal, and to have replied to Zaid that he (Commandant) has a duty to perform in protecting the town and the people, and that if he failed in that duty, he would be answerable to his Government. The Nakhoda of the boat above referred to reports that Jasim has issued an order to the Natiye craft, enjoining the Nakhoda's not to carry any passengers from the place, and that no one is now allowed to leave that place. The people of Ruwais and Abudhaluf have removed themselves to Bah rain with their families, cattle, and -chattels, by special boats from Bahrain, des patched by their tribesmen living there. The Nairn from Kuwais and other northern villages have also sent their families with all their effects to Bahrain. It is said that Jasim is constantly renewing his pact with the Naim for fear they might betray him. Some hints have gone to Jasim from here that the Naim are inwardly well disposed [towards the chief of Bahrain, and that they will not help him (Jasim) in time of need. But I do not believe in this.

Ross, c.S;i., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to my telegram of 13th instant, I enclose a translation of a report which I have receiyed from No. 37, dated nth May 1889. the Residency Agent at Lingah, containing intelligence of fighting having occurred between the forces of the Chief of Ahu- Thabi and those of Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, and the reported crushing defeat of the latter. I expect to receive the accounts from the other side in a few days. Translated purport of a report from the Residency Agent, Lingah, No. 37, dated the 11th May 1889. A vessel had arrived at Lingah from Abu-Thabi, with letters for merchants and others, in which it was stated that a ' kossid ' had arrived at Abu-Thabi from ' Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa (the Chief) bearing the news that he had first de tached Tahnoon (his son) with a body of troops composed of Debay and Abu-Thabi men to Karah, and they encountered a number of Jasim's party composed of Beni Hajir, Al-Morrah and Monasir, and inflicted on thera a severe defeat, three hundred of the enemy having been slain, many wounded and the rest put to flight. Much spoil was taken from Jasim's force, including 2,000 camels. Tahnoon's detachment then returned and joined Shaikh Zaid in the vicinity of Katr.. Shaikh Zaid with his own force encountered Jasim's force on 23rd Shaban (24ith April 1889) near Katr (El-Bidaa probably meant). Eighty-five of the Katr men were killed and many wounded, and they were routed and fled to Katr ( El-Bidaa ). Khalifa-bin-Jasim* » #A son of sh ^ h Ja8i,n - Thani and Ahmed-bin-Thani (Shaikh's bro, ther) were slain, and a report was received that Jasim himself also was wounded. Besides arms, about twenty horses of Jasim's were taken, and fifteen killed. Shaikh Zaid remained two days near Katr (Bidaa), but no one went out from the place to encounter him. He then retired towards Abu-Thabi, No. 117, dated Bushire, the 16th May 1889. From—C olonel E. C. Ross, c.s.i ., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. From the Residency Agent, Bahrain, No. 68, dated 30tb April 1889. From Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mobamed Thani, dated 21st April 1889, I have the honour to enclose translations of the correspondence noted on th e, margin, on the subject of 'a complaint that. Shaikh Jasim had sent munitions of war by sea, in furtherance of his warlike oper ations • against Abu-Thabi, to a place beyond the limits of .his jurisdiction, and within those of the Abu-Thabi Chief. A precis of the previous correspondence is also enclosed. 2. There is no room for doubt as to the facts alleged, and it has been, ruled by the Government of India that Odeyd, and consequently Sila, is under Abu-Thabi, and Shaikh Jasim has therefore made use of the sea to operate hos- tilely against his Beni Yas enemies and invade their territory. 3. Although there is no express undertaking on the part of the Chiefs who, are parties to the maritime truce, to abstain from acting against each other by sea, it is well understood by all that such action would be constructively a breach of their engagement to the British Government, and might subject them to penalties. Whilst abiding by this necessary rule themselves, the ' Trucial' Chiefs naturally expect us to impose a similar restriction on the Katr Chief who indeed does not repudiate the obligation, but boldly claims Sila as Katr territory, and further denies having sent boats to that place with war stores. 2 - MwftlffWWB.3crt 4s. I tliink perhaps the Government of India would not think it expedient in present circumstances to exact a penalty from Shaikh Jasim, which would mean employment of Naval force; hut I think it would he desirable to authorize me to intimate to Jasim the disapproval and displeasure of Government at his action, and to inform him that a repetition of it would lead to measures of a more serious nature. The delicacy of the position as regards Katr requires me to seek the instruction of Government in this case. No. 68, dated tlie 30th April 1889. From—The Residency Agent at Bahrain, • To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I beg to forward herewith a letter from Jasim-hin-Thani to your address, in reply to your No. 103, in which he says that Sila is within his territories . This is his own assertion, which he makesjn order to exculpate himself from hlame. He forgets, however, that notwithstanding his wish to reside at Odeyd which is under Sila, and which is distant from the latter place one day's jour ney, he was not allowed to do so. As regards Sahakha, its soil is covered in some parts with saline incrus tations and in others is sandy. No grass grows on it. It begins from near Sila and ends at J)afrah. Sahakha is one day's journey distant from either of these places, Jasim says that he despatched to Sila only two boats containing provisions. This assertion goes against him. If Sila is within his territories, and he is prepared to repel even by force of arms any one that might come there, why does he attempt to palliate by saying that he sent there only two boats ? He refers to the incident at Dafrah, and says that Zaid had written to him saying that he (Zaid) had no connection with the people of that place. If so, why did Jasim slaughter them wholesale, and what crime had they committed ? According to his assertion, it is Zaid who is his enemy ; it is therefore absurd of Jasim to wreak his vengeance on them, when they are not in any way connected with the enemy. 'What he means, however, is that some thieves were infesting Dafrah, about whom he wrote to Zaid, who might have probably said that the matter did not concern him. The fact is that Jasim is now trying by all the means in his power to ex culpate himself. Dated the 21st ApriJ 1889. From— J asim-bin-Thani, To—-The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments. —I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 25th Eejjub (28th March) in which you mention that I despatch ed a boat to Kufariyah and Sila. But these places are within my terri tories, and I have told you so before. It is a matter of public notoriety that Sabakha is the zone which separates Katr from Dafrah. A portion of Sabakha on the side of Katr is comprehended within Katr territory ; and it is my duty to repel even by force of arms any one that encroaches upon Sila and other places within my territory. I request you to be impartial in the matter. If you have any doubt as to what I say, you can ascertain, and you will find that what I say is true. If you enquire of people who know and are just, you will find that Dafrah is not called so until past Sabakha. Is it ever said that people residing at Sila are residing at Dafrah ? It is an established fact that the limit of Oman on our side is first Dafrah. It is Zaid who has invaded my country, killed some people, and made others captives, without there being any previous cause, 34 except that I went to Dafrah, the place of the Monasir tribe, the mischief makers both by land and sea. But the country of Zaid is 9 days' journey off. How does he get angry with one who goes to punish the offenders, and expects me not to be so when he invades my country ? It is essentially neces sary that I should rise and march against his country for the purpose of wreaking vengeance upon him. Of course I am waiting for an opportunity, and I am not off my guard. I pray for*equity and justice at your hands, for which you are renowned. Some days past I despatched two boats containing provisions and nothing else. This is what was necessary for me to inform you about. j&gt; S. —I hold many letters from Zaid, bearing on the subject of the crimes committed by the people of Dafrah, in which he disowned them and told me that I could myself call them to account. I have those letters with ^me now, and should you wish to see them, I shall forward them to you. Precis of correspondence relating to a complaint made by Shaikh Zaid, that Shaikh Jasim sent stores and munitions o£ war by sea to Al-Sila and the Bay of Kufariyah, during his expedition against El.Jawa. On the 13th January 1889, the Residency Agent at Shargah forwarded* a letter to the Resident from Shaikh Zaid- * Undercover 0.6. bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abu-Thabi, cam- plaining that Shaikh Jasim-bin-Muhammad-bin-Thani of El-Bidaa had sent armed men and stores by sea to Al-Sila, a place included in his (Shaikh Zaid's) territories.

In this letter the boats and their owners were specified. The Residency Agent also forwarded, at the same time, the state ment of one Thani-bin-Ataish (the brother of the owner of one of the boats specified in Shaikh Zaid's letter), which is to the following effect, viz., that he, under orders from Shaikh Jasim, conveyed a cargo of dates in his brother's boat from Wakrah to the Bay of Kufariyah, in company with four other boats laden with stores and spears. The man adds that the crews of those boats told him that they had also gunpowder, lead, and muskets on board, and he corro borates the report that Jasim had sent stores by sea to Al-Sila. , No. em dated 16th Feb™,, im ^ r®? 1 ?'

Agent at Bahrain wrotef thathe had heard reports or Jxisim having sent men, muni tions of war and stores by sea to Al-Sila. He had questioned two men of the Al-Naim (who had been with Jasim in his expedition), who said that both in going and returning Jasim's men took w r hat stores amd munitions of war they required from boats at Al-Sila; 25 to 30 armed men of El-Bidaa being left as guards in each boat. The Residency Agent also forwarded a confidential ** Dated 26thDecember 1888. letter** which he had received from one Ali-bm-Hassan-bin-Jamal of El-Bidaa, in which the writer states that 5 boats laden with stores and munitions of war, had gone from El-Bidaa to Al-Sila, and specifies the boats and their owners. On receipt of the above, the Resident wroteff to Shaikh Jasim that he had tt No. 103, dated 28th M^rch 1889. from various sources that he (Jasim) had sent, during his recent hostilities5 against the people dependent on the Chief of Ahu-Thabi, vessels with stores and munitions of war to the Bay of Kufariyah and Al-Sila,—places beyond the limits of his recognized jurisdiction; and called for an explanation. On the 17th April, Shaikh Jasim wrote to the Resident, making a counter- complaint that Shaikh Zaid had sent a boat to Al-Sila, which place he (Jasim) claimed to be within his territory.

From—The Residency Agent, at Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that Akif Pasha, the new Mutaserif of El- Hasa, arrived at Bahrain by the mail steamer. Muhammad Abdul Wahab went on board to see him and took him to Manamah. The Mutaserif remained with Muhammad Abdul Wahab for two days and one night, and then went to El-Hasa in a boat which was hired-by Muhammad Abdul Wahab at his own expense, and he accompained the Mutaserif as far as Bideyyia (on the confines of Bahrain). The Mutaserif went to Ojeyr, and from thence to El-Hasa. It is probable that Muhammad Abdul Wahab gave him some money. The Mutaserif was informed regarding the pending encounter between Jasim and Zaid. Nasrallah, brother of Ahmed-bin-Mehdy, informed me that Jasim, son of Muhammad-bin-Katr, when he arrived at Busrah, had telegraphed to|Constan- tinople through the Nakib to the following effectZaid with 8,000 troops, and instigated and supported by the British, has come to Katr, which has been a Turkish province for many years.' There was a reply received at Busrah to the above telegram, but'in the interval, Shaban Pasha happened to be deposed, and the affair was forgotten. Jasim -bin-Muhammad-bin-Khatr and Nasrallah the above mentioned, re turned from Busrah with Akif Pasha. During the voyage, Jasim-bin-Muham- mad-bin-Khatr was constantly with him, and kept talking about the affairs of Bahrain and Katr. Jasim is a young and.light minded man, and it was his own offieiousness that prompted him to enter on such subject. Mohamed Abdul Wahab, who is a shaitan and loves disturbance, acquanited the Mutaserif with all that is going on in these parts, and was seconded by Abdul Eahman-bin- Aidan and Mujbil-ad-Dukeyr in everything that he told the Mutaserif. I have heard that on the night of the Mutaserif's arrival here, Abdul Wahab des patched letters to Katr, and also despatched Ghanim in a special boat to Katr, with letters after the Mutaserif's departure from here. I suspect two things from these measures of Muhammad Abdul Wahab, viz., (1) that he asked the Mutaserif to write a letter to the Commandant of the Turkish troops stationed at Bidaa, enjoining him to protect the people of Katr against Zaid; and (2) to write a threatening letter to Shaikh Zaid in order to deter him from invading Katr.Abdul Wahab endeavoured to bring about an interview between the Muta serif and the Chief of Bahrain, but the former declined to go to the Chief s place, and the Chief did not like to go to the Mutasenf first. I had an interview with the Mutaserif which lasted for about 20 minutes. He did not speak out his views, but said that Bahrain was not a good place, and spoke highly of Karachi. He remarked in a laughing tone that he did not know why people were so fond of pearls which were a perishable article, and not so of gold and silver which were lasting. I think that he is a hot-tempered man, as he is a Military Ofecer and cannotbe skilled in administrative policy. Formerly the Turkish officials sent to Hasa, Katr and Katif, when they came here, did not interfere in the affairs, of Bahrain and Katr. TV hat they were occupied with was how to make money, but now there are many agitators in these places who win the ears of those officials by their eloquence. Nasrallah, brother of Ahmed-bin-Mehdi, and Mansoor came to Bahrain from Busrah with Akif Pasha, and they paid his passage, and all other expenses besides giving him about Es. 1,400 in cash, including the value of a watch (gold). This is the present which he got to start with. Then Mohamed Abdul Wahab also gave him some. At Hasa, the Mutaserif will get more bribes. After the Ramadan he will come to Katif and get something there too. Such is the conduct of the Turkish officials. But it is to be remembered that those who give them bribes do so for their own advantage with a view to purchase justice. No. 69, dated the 6th May 1889. From—The Residency Agent at Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. TV ith reference to my letter No. 65 of the 80th April 1889, I have the honour to report that Ghanim-bin-Ataish returned from Katr, and 1^ had a con versation with him regarding his journey to Katr. It was only by inadvertence that he gave me an account of his journey, and which is as follows ' I was the bearer of a letter from Akif Pasha to Shaikh Zaid which was handed to me by Muhammad Abdul Wahab. It was a threatening one, and Zaid was warned in it that any aggressive movement on his part against the villages subject to Katr, which is a Turkish province, would be promptly acted against. This letter was written under the impression that Zaid had already arrived at Katr, and it was meant that it should reach him there. The letter _ was open, and I gave it to Jasim for perusal. He said that Zaid had not arrived, • and that he (Jasim) had no need of such a letter as he was not afraid of Zaid. Then I brought back that letter, and gave it to Muhammad Abdul Wahab with another from Jasim. Shaikh Esau has seen that letter.' After the departure of the Mutaserif, I had an interview with the Chief of Bahrain, and asked him whether he had heard anything regarding the secret conversation which passed between the Mutaserif and Muhammad Abdul Wahab, and whether he knew what was the object of Ghanim's mission to Katr, who was despatched there with letters in a special boat. But I was unable to elicit any information from him. I have no doubt that this caution on his part has been enjoined by Muhammad Abdul Wahab. . Prom what I have heard it appears « Probably regarding the attitude he should oh- that the Mutaserif has not Sent any Order* S ln '' to the Commandant of the Turkish troops stationed at Bida. Ghanim-bin-Atai sh was originally a subject of Zaid, and was living at Puweyrat. When Jasim ordered the abandonment of that place he came to Bahrain, and is now in the service of Muhammad Abdill Wahab. He informs me that during his recent stay at Bidaa he heard that Jasim had sent two boats, with 30 or 40 armed men in each, to Sila for the purpose of finding out whether there were any boats lying there belonging to the people of Oman. One of those boats belonged to Khalifa-bin-ISIasir-al-Suweydi, called As- . samhah; the other to Sheyban of the tribe of Al-Soodan. These boats on their arrival at Sila saw some boats lying there. In the boat of Sheyban there were 6amongst the armed men some of the Maadid, a tribe to which Jasim belongs, who fired at the boats lying at Sila. Meantime one of the boats despatched by Jasim and belonging to Khalifa returned to Katr and informed regarding the presence of boats at Sila, and that they had seen tents pitched on shore and a number of Arabs. The armed men in this boat were of the tribe of Soodan, and as Jasim had no confidence in them, he put in it some more men of the Maadid and despatched it again to Sila. When it arrived there, they saw there a small boat engaged in pearlfishing, and in which there* were only one man and two boys. The men of Jasim seized that man, and said they were going to take him before Jasim. He refused to follow them, but was carried away by force. He observed that he thought the sea was secure against ag gression, and told them that the two boys would not be able to manage his boat, but he was not listended to. They asked him about the boats that were at Sila, and he told them that they were boats belonging to the people of Oman which were pearlfishing as usual, but that they had taken to flight owing to the firing of Bidaa boats, and that it is probable that some of the people in them might have received a bullet shot. The man's name is Abdullah-bin-Suweyeh Mazroo'ai from Abu-Thabi. He had with him some pearls which they took away from him, promising to return to him the same. They then took him before Jasim, who threatened him in such a way that those present thought he would be killed. But the object of this thereat was simply to obtain from him information about Zaid. He said that Zaid had with him 2,000 troops, and was marching against Katr; but as for himself, that he was a poor diver. At the time of Ghanim's departure from Bidaa, this man was there, and it was said that he was going to be sent back to his boat if it happened to be at Sila, or else that he would be left in the island of Dalmah. Muhammad-bin-Muhanah-al-Naimi sailed from Bahrain with a cargo of dates for Abu-Thabi, and on his voyage passed by Al-Wakrah. Some people from Bahrain advised Jasim that this boat contained arms for Zaid, sp Jasim stopped it, and it was only released through the intervention of the Naim-al- Jabir. It was found that the boat had only two guns, which belonged to the boat itself. No. 71, dated the 14th May 1889. From—The Residency Agent at Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. V ■ With reference to my letter No. 66, reporting the arrival of Shaikh Zaid bin-Khalifa near, Ojevr, and of his having encamped at Karah, I have the honour to report the following account which I have gathered regarding the fight. The number of killed were two men of the Monasir* tribe against whom there was a blood-claim; two men of the • The section which is friendly to Jasim. Beni Hajir ; a son of Salim-bin-Shafi, one of the Shaikhs of the Beni Hajir, who was killed by mistake for Salim-bin- Shafi, is a friend of Zaid, and there is a compact between them ; two men ot the Al-Morrah tribe among those wh#were tending camels. The casualties on Zaid's side were two killed, and one of the Shaikhs of the Monasirf wound ed on the palm of one of his hands. His t The section which is with Jasim. ^ Jereyi0f Regarding the number of camels carried away by Zaid's troops, the account varies. Some say 800, and others more; and as no one has come this side from those who took part in the engagement, I have been unable to ascertain the exact amount of booty carried away. The camels mostly belonged to the people of Katr, and had been entrusted to the Al-Morrah for the purpose being tended ; some to the Beni Hajir and some to the Monasir. Two mares belonging to one Seif- al-Hajiri, a friend of Jasim-bin-Thani, were also carried away; and two more whose feet were cut.It is said that Zaid has started from Karah and is marching towards Katr, but I think he must have changed his mind and is not going to Katr. The number of his troops is estimated at 1,200, and even less than that; and it is said that the camels belonging to his transport have been seized with a disease. It appears that when the news of Zaid having started from Karah reach ed Jasim, he inarched out with 800 men mounted on horses and camels to trace out the movements of Za id's army, and that he found their traces at Sila, from whence they had marched back to their country. Jasim writes to Mujbil to the effect that Zaid has retraced his steps having found out that he (Jasim) was well prepared for him, and that it is now his (Jasimus) intention to despatch against Zaid one expedition after another.

After Compliments.—1 have received your letter, dated. 3rd Eamazan 1306 (4th May 1889), and have perused its contents regarding Sila. It is known to me and to all that Sila is within the limits of Katr Coast. The people who were residing in the Northern Coast lines of Katr, some went to Daafeen and others to Bahrain, and thus the ports in those coast lines t- Remained without permanent inhabitants, became deserted.f But the Bedouins of . all tribes living in the Katr territory fre quent those ports, the Beni Hajir and^l-Morrah, amongst whom I have many enemies, being included. The Bedouins who frequent those ports, some are under my jurisdiction and others are not, and whoever happens to be my enemy goes thither and joins them. It happens that boats from Bahrain come to those ports either with or without the cognizance of the Chief of Bahrain. The Bedouins then overpower the boat's crew, seize the boat and put to sea (with piratical designs). It is therefore necessary for you and Shaikh Esau to warn the sea-faring people not to call at those ports. Should any boat find it necessary to take water or provisions on the voyage, it should call either at Bidaa or Daeen. There are numerous Bedouins infesting the Katr Coast; they are my enemies, and are not amenable to my orders : and I cannot therefore be responsible for their acts. 8No. 131, dated Busliire, the I9tli June 1889.

Ross, c.s.i ., Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf and Her Majesty's Consul-Geaeral for Pars, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Poreign Department. i have the honour to enclose translation of a report received from the Residency Agent at Shargah, containing No 52, dated 1st June 1889. account of the proceedings of the com bined forces of Ahu-Thahi and Debay, during the recent expedition towards EI-Katr. No. 52, dated 1st June 1889. Prom—The Residency Agent at Shargah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to report that on the 15th May Shaikh Zaid-bin- Khalifa arrived at Abu-Thabi. On the 17th May, Makthum-bin-Hasher arrived at Debay. I went to Debay for the purpose of delivering the presents to the Chief of that place and to Makthum-bin-Hasher. Makthum-bin- Hasher gave me the following account of Shaikh Zaid's expedition. When the expedition arrived at Sabakhah on the frontiers of Katr, they experienced great scarcity of water, which had to be obtained by digging new wells. At Sabakhah Shaikh Zaid held a council of war with the Chiefs of the tribes that were with him, at which it was decided that the present was not an opportune moment for a March on Katr, as Jasim was entrenched at El-Bidaa, and as there was no fodder for the animals in the suburbs of Katr.^ It was deemed sufficient for the present to punish the tribes (who had assisted^ Jasim) by plundering them. So the expedition started and went to a place called Karah, in the neighbourhood of Hasa, and plundered everything they found there, irrespective of the fact whether it belonged to foe or friend. The expedition then marched to Ojeyr, where the Bedouins of Karah had taken shelter in the fort (at Ojeyr). But Shaikh Zaid prevented his men from investing the fort, as his object was not murder but plunder. The booty taken from the Bedouins at Karah was 2,000 camels, besides much household goods and many arms. After the attack was over, those of the Bedouins who had treaty relations with Shaikh Zaid and whose property was plundered in tlie affair at Karah, came to Shaikh Zaid, and asked him to restore to them their camels, which he willingly did. So after returning the camels of the friendly tribes, the net booty carried away was 600 camels and 8 horses. The number of killed in the engagement at ^ Karah was 18 men of the Monasir and Beni Hajir tribes who are under Jasim. A son of Bin-Shafi, Chief of Beni Hajir, was also killed, but this happened by mistake, as that Chief is the friend of Shaikh Zaid. The friendly Bedouins of Karah have renewed their compact with Shaikh Zaid. Erom Karah, Shaikh Zaid (having changed his mind) wanted to march on Katr, but found that the camels were all jaded, and a disease broke out amougst them. The expedition lost only two men in the engagement at Karah. 0 Extract from the Diary of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the week ending the 21st June 1889. ^ ^ ^ ^ * 1. It is said that a Turkish man-of-war is expected here shortly from Busrah with troops for the relief of the garrisons of Katr and Katif.

Persons who have arrived here from Bidaa report, as authentic news, that Jasim-hin-Thani has despatched a marauding expedition to Oman, com posed of over 200 men. The main body of the expedition is said to consist of men of the tribes who were recently plundered of their camels by Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa. It is stated that the expedition was organised by Jasim owing to the encouragement given him by those tribes, who are longing for revenge. No. 1382-E., dated Simla, the 5tli July 1889. From— H. S.

The hostilities were initially due to the dispute on the sovereignty over Al Udaid [’Odaid, Qatar] considered to be Abu Dhabi property, and provoked attacks and raids. The main events dealt with in the volume are the attack of Bedouin from Abu Dhabi on Al Bida [Qatar] during which twenty-four men were killed including Ali, Shaikh Jasim's son, and the subsequent Qatari attack to Dhafrah [Abu Dhabi].The volume also contains copious letters in Arabic (with English translations) sent to the Political Resident in Persian Gulf at Bushire by local rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad bin 'Abdullah Āl Rashīd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Bidda</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Odaid</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
