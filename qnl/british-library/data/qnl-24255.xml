T'\ / 7he Secretary, / / ) to the Political Reeldent in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. Most Esteemed Sir, I the undersigned Mamibai (alias Jamnabai) widow of Seth Pharaanmal Jethannnd Hindu, Bhatia, most humbly and respectfully be^ to approach your noble self with the foll owing facte of my grcivances and pray that your honour as Representative of the British Government there will be graciously pleased to come to my aid and do me JUSTICE and JUSTICE alone which is the pivot of benign British Government Reprcsentativee. The facts in brief are that my deceased husband owned an undivided half share in an immoveable property consist ing of two Gurphas and two Vakhars situate at Dubai jointly with one Kishlnchand Nath»mal Bhetia who used to carry on business there in the name of Laioomal Nathamal. (It being now rumoured that the raid Kishlnchand has now changed the name of his firm for reasons known to him). During the life time of my husband the said Kishlnchand used to pay us less thah Rs BOO/- t-&gt; R&amp; fOO,/- s year on account of our half share of rent, but after the death of my husband, taking advantage of my being a helpless widow and with minor children, the sa'd Klshinchand began to give no either abnormal t-rnblo/by not paying no the rent due to m? or by naytng the same only nominal. Suffice it to say that on -bo s«.i.d Kishinchand 'T.Mthamal ontorul into ai agreement and agreed to pay me Rs 1?-«-u p.m. net on account of my husband's half share of rent, I regret to bring to your honour's notice that the .said Kiehinchand has not abidw by th. terras 0 f the satd agreement Pnd has been avoiding to pay „« an d has b««n al vlng me very great troubi. only because I am a helpless&amp; 3 helpless widow with minor children quite unable to come down there in order to take possession of ray share. I therefore approach your Noble Self with a reqeet that as the property is siftato in your honour's jurisdiction and under your honour's control and as I am a helpless widow with minor children, your honour will be graciously pleased to come to my rescue and call upon the said Seth Klshlnchand Nathaal to pay me the agreed rent of Rs 12/8/- a month since the date of agreement i.e 5 - 3-1933 and also be J &gt;1 eased to order him to pay me the same regularly. ^or this act of your honour's benevolence, I shall ' uu+, y bound ever pray **or your honour's long life and prosperity. I beg to remain. Sir, • Your most obedient servant.

India. To, The Secretary to the Political Resident In the Sir, Bushire Persian Gulf, at Buahire. T a-n greatly obliged to your honour for yoEPF'llemoran- duu ..o. 1^14 14 ^ XX dated the 10th instant and in obedien ce to your honour’s orders contained therein be*? to subr.lt herewith copy of agreement dated between Seth Kishlnchand Nathan 1 vfeaxuxxnx(with whom my deceased husband was a. partner) on one hand and Chaturbhuj ay son on the otrer hand and also be* to submit copy of Seth Kiehlnchand ^athamal s recent and last letter dated the 21 - 7 - 1937 addressed to my said son Chaturbhuj. I submit, Dir, that a perusal of the aforesaid two copies of agreement and letter wiii arc quite sufficient to convince your honour that ray half share in the said propert ies is admitted by the said Seth Xaitonaxi Kishlnchand Natha- mal. It is.also a fact that after the death of my husband none of us has been able to go to that side for obvious reasons viz: I beln* a helpless widow, my children being minor and ignorant and we being without funds. Sir, it is also a fact that I and my children arc entirely at the mercy of Doth K 1 shinchand Nathanal partner of my husband who knows perfectly well that none of ue and^none on our behalf '*U 1 be in a position to take the trouble to come there. It U, Sir, therefore quite clear that Seth Kishinchand Nathamal is taking advantage of our inability and helpless ness and creating one or the other hitch Vs will be soon from his last letter s»»x dated 2 l- 7 - 37 (copy enclosed for 10 a', y rexerence) with a view to evade payment of our shsrc of rent, ^e copy of the agreement will convince your honour that under clause 4 all repairs are to be done byby the said Seth Klshlndas Nathamal hi'neelf without any reference to us. The allegation^ contained in his letter dated SI-T-^T vide please last nortion that my eon had given him his approve 1 last year to carry out the repairs is denied in X*xt* toto. To he short,since my right title and interest in the said properties is fully admitted to the extent of half share by the said Seth Kishlnchand Nathamal, I submit, Sir, that I am entitled to half the rent according to the market rate prevailing there - I am entitled to have the property partitioned through your honour's Government - I am entitled to have my half share sold off through your honour's Government. There is nothing to vouchsafe the various statements and allegations contain3d in the letter of Seth Kishinchand Nathamal dated 21-7-37 « All that youfnoble self will bo able to gather from the said letter that taking advantage of my weakness Seth Klshinehand wants to dictate his terms and chooses to keep the property in his occupation at his choice rent. Under these circumstances, I have come to your honour's door and appeal to your honour's sense of mercy towards me a helpless widow with minor children and pray for Justice being meted out to|mc by your honour's good Government - by cither getting me the rent due to me on account of my naif share or by getting me the said property partitioned ana thereafter disposed off at a reasonable price. There v-as a time when Rs SOu/- to Rs 6 uu/- wore received by us on account our half share and it is ridiculous to believe what Seth Kishinchand Nathamal has the boldness to write in his letter. All good Governments protect the interasts of minors and widows and help them - the British Government is the best of all and T am sanguine that your noble honour in your capacity as the representative of the said best Govern ment on earth will be graciously pleased to consider my case charitably and save my property from being usurped or ruined by my husband's partner Seth Kishlndas Nathamal. whose&amp; 4 COPY. — — — This agreement is ,r ifld.e in Karachi hotwoon Chaturbhuj Dhamanmal on the one part and Seth Kishlndps Natha^nal on the other osrt, both parties afrreelma: as follows:- (1/ Both parties Jointly own in equal shares a landed property with a building thereon at Debai (Persian Gulf).

Seth Kishindas Bathamal of Dubai. 0^Transletion of letter No 874/937 dated 9th October 1937. from the Residency Agent, Sharjah to the Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments, V/ith reference to your letter No 298 dated 25th August 1937, I enclose herewith a petition dated the 19th September 1937 from Seth Kishandas Nathomal . Following your instructions I have made the necessary enquiries in this case with the plaintiff (defendant) who informed me that since the son of the plaintiff attained his majority,he was directly paying him his share in the rent and that he 1ms the relative receipts in his office in India, He also says that his mother the plaintiff has no right to any claim and that he cannot do or act according to her wishes. He is also willing to sell the property and take his share of the proceeds should her son request him to do so. I have inspected the property and found it to be in a delapidated state and that unless some repairs are made it will be reduced to ruins and which is not in the interest of both the parties. As regards the rent mentioned in the letter of Kishandas dated the 21st July 1937, it is the best rent obtainable at present for this property. According to the Hindus Law the eldest son has the right to the inheritance of the property , and where as Chatarbujdas according to the statement of Kishandas is now twentysix years of age, he is the only person to claim his share and therefore he should appoint an attorney to undertake the sale on his behalf. The property as I saw it, is unsepara- ble in a way benificial to both parties. The best course would be to put the property in auction and whoever of them wishes to buy it he can do so, otherwise it w r ill be sold to a third party and the claimants each takes his share, or the order rests with you. I am returning herewith all the papers forward ed with your above letter. Usual ending.Copy. &amp; Dubai 19 / 9 / 1937. To The Honourable Resident ana Consulate General Bushire. Respected Sir, I, the undersigned beg to state tnat I was reac over by Mr Sayed iibdul Razak, the Residency Agent, Sharjah, the letter of Mismat Manibaiin respect to the property situated at Dubai in e^ual partnership of myself ana the son of said Manibai. The facts are as under.; Manibai is not concerned party at present as Chatarbojdas, her son and the legal heir of Biiamanmal, has attained maturity since about 8 years back and is the sole own er of the said property, I always deal with him since attain ing his maturity and it is false ana frivolous to hold out a young man of about 26 years of age as a minor. Your Honour is well aware of the Hindu Law I can well imagine that Mr. Chatarbojdas who is the only son of his father, is the proper owner of the property in question ana that the attitude taken by said Manibai is only to misrepresent the facts before your honour in oraer to prejudice your honour against me and to put me in unnecessary trouble. The said Chatarbojdas always receive the rent of his share when recovered. Even recently he received Rs 40/- towards his half share in rents recovered last year from one Narsingdas Karidas ana always likewise he has been receiving proportionately the rents when realised. It is untrue that there exists any such agreement by which I nave to pay fixed amount of rents for ever. If at all there exists such it must be for a year or for the time specified therein which shall not exceed a year. Your honour knows always that the rents of properties are chageable according to tne circuraastances ssn and it is silly ana absurd to contend that I am to pay rents according to the alleged agreement. If any period is specified in the alleged agreement, she must have received the rentsof her share accoraing to the terras statea therein. As regards the repairs your honour can well understand the dishonest attitude of tne lady who is prepared to receive her share from the rents while evades the responsibility of repairs. No such agreement, verbal or written exists and the attitude of the lacy is only to put me in unnecessary trouble. Nven a cdild would not enter into sucn agreement taking tne burden of repairs on his own shoulders wnile paying the rents himself. as regards tne disposal of the property she can ask her son to dispose of his share as no one can prevent him from doing so. He is at full liberty to dispose of his share with which I have no concern at all. But I uo hereby request your honour to inform the parties to proceed with tne repairs forthwith as any futther delay will cause considerable damage to the property which is in very bad state and quite unsuitable for lodging purposes. I have also requested L?r Sayed Abdul Kazak , The Residency Agent at Sharjah to come to the spot personally for inspecting the condition of the said property. As I am to leave within a month or so, your honour will do the needful r soon I shall inform tne parties that if owing to their delay any damage is caused to the property, I shall hold them responsible for the loss caused . to my share owing to their negligence in respect to the repairs.
