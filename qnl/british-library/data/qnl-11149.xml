D. 1118 A A HANDBOOK OF MESOPOTAMIA V olume I GENERAL SECOND EDITION Prepared on behalf of the War NOVEMBER, 1918 NAVAL STAFF INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENTNOTE Mesopotamia is treated in four volumes. This first introductory volume contains matter of a general nature. The other volumes die devoted to the detailed description of the river and land routes. The second volume covers the regions of the Shatt el- c Arab and Karun, and of the Tigris and Euphrates up to Baghdad and Fellujeh. To the third volume are assigned the Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad and Fellujeh to Mosul and Meskeneh ? the Lesser Zab ; the country east of the Tigris towards the Persian frontier, and the loutes itinning westward from the Euphrates valley across the Syrian desert. Ihe fourth volume treats of the country north of the line joining Kowanduz, Mosul, Meskeneh, and Aleppo up to Van, Bitlis, Diarbekr, and Marash. This volume gives an account of conditions in Mesopotamia for the most part as they were before the war, Wliile some recent develop ments have been mentioned, most of the changes that have taken place in the country since 1914 have not been described.CONTENTS chap.

Boundaries, Position, and Extent The 'boundaries of the ami dealt with in this book are as follows: On the south : the Persian Gulf and the desert of north-eastern Arabia. On the west: the Syrian Desert and, towards the north-west, where Mesopotamia adjoins northern Syria, the western side of the Euphrates trough between Gerger and Meskeneh. On the north : the highest crests of the eastern Taurus ranges (the southern rim of the Armenian plateau), eastwards from where the Euphrates breaks through these mountains to the south-western corner of Lake Van near Bitlis. On the north-east, from Bitlis to the Kelishin Pass on the Persian frontier south-west of Ushnu: a line following the watershed between the Tigris on the south-west and Lakes Van and Urmia on the north and east respectively. On the east, from the Kelishin Pass to the Persian Gulf: the high ranges which form the western rim of the plateau of Iran (Persia). This region lies between lat. 38° 30' N. and lat. 29° 30' N. Its northern part falls between long. 37° 50' E. and long. 45° 30' E. ; its southern end is between long. 48° 30' E. and long. 51° 30' E. Its length, from the Arghana Pass in the eastern Taurus to Fao at the mouth of the Shatt el-Arab, is 770 miles. From west to east its greatest breadth is about 380 miles (from Birijik on the Euphrates to the Kelishin Pass on the Persian frontier); its breadth in the neighbourhood of Baghdad is about 150 miles. Its total area is about 200,000 square miles. The greater part ot this country lies within the boundaries of the Turkish Empire, including the eastern part of the vilayet (province;10 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES of Aleppo, the greater part of the vilayet of Diarbekr, part of the vilayet of Bitlis, the greater part of the vilayet of Van, the eastern part of the mutessariflik of Zor, and the vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra. On its south-eastern side, from the southern end of the Avroman Dagh to the Persian Gulf, it takes in a belt of Persian territory, namely the western part of the province of Kirmanshah, the Pusht-i-Kuh country and part of southern Luristan, the provinces of northern and southern Arabistan, the plain of Behbehan, and the Bakhtiyari and Kuhgalu countries. Main Features op Surface The area as a whole may be regarded as a great depression running SSE. from the northern corner of Syria and the high plateaux of Ana tolia and Armenia down to the head of the Persian Gulf. The eastern side of this depression is formed by the mountainous edge of the Persian plateau, the western and south-western side by the gradual slope of the Syrian and Arabian Deserts, which fall towards the Euphrates valley from the highlands of Syria and the plateau of Arabia, Under the high mountains which enclose Mesopotamia on the north and east is a belt of lower hill-country, varying in breadth roughly from 40 to 100 miles, and below this again are the Mesopotamian plains, which form the floor of the depression. To the west and south west of these, along the right side of the Euphrates valley, rise the low cliffs or hills which are the border of the desert. The plains thus bounded have a total area of about 112,000 square miles. From their northern end down to the flat shores of the Persian Gulf they fall some 1,100-1,400 ft. in 650-700 miles. The upper plain-country between the northern hill-belt and the neighbourhood of Baghdad has a fall of about 900-1,200 ft. in 350- 450 miles. Its undulating surface is composed of sedimentary forma tions, and is traversed here and there (especially in its northern part) by chains of sandstone, gypsum, or basalt hills. Not far to the north of Baghdad the upper plains end in a drop of 20-50 ft. (which marks a former coast-line), and the great alluvial plain of Irak, formed by the Euphrates and the Tigris, begins. The alluvium of Irak stretches down to the head of the Persian Gulf, falling a little over 100 ft. in 300-350 miles. Towards the south east the Irak plain is continued by the alluvial lands of Arabistan created by the Karun and by the smaller streams of the Jerrahi and the Hindlyan. The total area of the alluvial plains is about 50,000- 55,000 square miles.BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 11 Relation to International Lines of Communication While at its southern extremity the Mesopotamian depression opens on to the Persian Gulf ? at its north-western corner, between the trough of the Euphrates and the passes of the Giaour Dagh ? which give access to the Gulf of Alexandretta and the south-eastern corner of Anatolia, there lies only a belt of easy country 70-120 miles broad (the northern corner of Syria). Thus the Mesopotamian plains and lower hill-country form a great corridor, which, shut in between the mountains on the one side and the desert on the other, connects the eastern Mediterranean and southern Anatolia with the Persian Gulf, and thus, again, this country is a stage on the most direct line of communication between central or southern Europe and southern Asia. Further, the most direct lines of approach from the eastern end of the Mediterranean (the Levant) to the Persian plateau and so to central Asia lie across the northern and central part of Mesopotamia. The mountains on the western side of the Persian plateau over looking Mesopotamia are, almost everywhere, a very difficult barrier; but there is one marked natural gate through them—the depression in the ranges near Qasr-i-Shlrln, about 110 miles NE. of Baghdad. From Sivas in eastern Anatolia, an important route-centre, which is connected by main routes w T ith the Black Sea port of Samsun and with Constantinople through central Anatolia, there is a line of communication with Diarbekr in northern Mesopotamia by way of Kharput and the Arghana defile through the Taurus, and from Diarbekr easy lines can be found through Mesopotamia to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf or central Persia. But the direct main line of communication between Sivas or the Black Sea port of Trebizond and north-west Persia passes north of Lake Van by Erzerum and Bayazid to Tabriz, and therefore lies outside our area. Geographical Divisions and their Surface In describing the surface of particular regions within the whole area under consideration, it will be convenient to make a division between Lower and Upper Mesopotamia. Lower Mesopotamia and the Adjoining Country Under this heading fall [a) the alluvial plains of Irak and Arabistan, (b) the borderland of hill-country and mountains dividing these plains from the Persian plateau, together with the depression in the12 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES mountain-barrier NE. of Baghdad, and (c) the fringe of the Arabian desert to the south-west of Irak. The whole of this area is about 95,000 square miles, or somewhat larger than Great Britain. (a) The Alluvial Plains of IraJc and —A line drawn from Delli Abbas 60 miles NNE. of Baghdad to Beled near the right bank of the Tigris some 20 miles below Samarra, and thence to Hit on the Euphrates, would roughly mark the northern limits of the alluvial plain. Somewhat more exactly it may be said that, while the Tigris begins near Beled to flow over an alluvial bed and between strips of alluvial plain, and the bed of the Euphrates changes to alluvium at Hit, in the area between the rivers the upper plain- country runs down in a tongue of comparatively high-lying marl desert almost to the line Baghdad—Fellujeh. To the north-east of Baghdad the alluvium runs up along the Diyaleh to the foot of the Jebel Hamrln. The plains of Irak contain about 35,000 square miles, those of Arabistan and the adjoining district of Behbehan about 17,000 square miles. The alluvial country is in general a flat plain. In Irak the only noticeable eminences are the mounds that mark the sites of dead cities, the high banks of old canal-beds, and here and there knolls or slight ridges of gravel or sand. In the northern part of Arabistan there are a few low lines of sandstone hills, advanced outliers of the hill-country, which run across the flats in a general NW.-SE. direction. The slope of the Irak plains from the neighbourhood of Baghdad to the Persian Gulf is, as has been remarked above, very slight. Baghdad is 105 ft. above sea-level, Kut el-Amara on the Tigris 55 ft., Nasirlyeh on the Euphrates 15 ft,, Basra 8 ft. There are also very gradual downward inclines away from the rivers, and a slope from the foot of the Persian hills to the neighbourhood of the Tigris; these have great importance, both in determining the present flood- areas and marshes, and also for projects of irrigation. In Arabistan, along the line of the Karun, the slope from the foot of the hill- country to the Persian Gulf is about 660 ft. in 175 miles (Dizful, 660 ft. above sea-level; Shushtar, 400 ft.; Ahwaz, 220 ft. ; Moham- mareh, 7 ft). The soil is mainly an argillaceous, calcareous loam of great fertility. Pockets of stiff clay or pebbles, more or less sandy patches, and areas of saline efflorescence occur here and there. By far the greater part of the country is either marsh-land or arid waste. The marsh-land is due to the annual river-floods, which rise above the general levels of the country and are neither relieved by escape-works nor confined by adequate dyking. The aridity of otherBOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 18 parts is due to the slightness of the rainfall and the absence of irrigation. There are extensive permanent marshes in the southern part of Irak. On the Euphrates great reedy broads have formed along the Hindiyeh branch of the river between Museyib and Samaweh, and lower down between Nasirlyeh, Kurna, and Basra. Along the Tigris between Amara and Kurna there is much permanent marsh-land on both sides of the river. The marshes on the left bank are continuous with the marshes on the lower Karkeh in Arabistan territory. At the northern end of Irak the salt lake of 'Aqarqnf is fed from the Euphrates. Besides the permanent swamps (which rise and fall with the season) the winter and spring floods of the rivers spill into wide inundations, which generally dry up in the latter part of the summer, but sometimes, when they have no adequate outlet, may remain standing for some years. Many of them turn salt or brackish before they disappear. These temporary flood-areas are to be found both in northern and southern Irak and in southern Arabistan. Their position and extent vary, within limits, from year to year. (See furthex' p. 2o.) The local name for a temporary or permanent expanse of marsh or open water is Ichor. Where or when the country is not swamp, it is for the most part open plain, scantily supplied with wells and water-holes, many of which, being generally dependent on the winter and spring rainfall, are dry in the summer or autumn. In spring much of this ' desert' (which for the most part has an exceedingly fertile soil) is covered with grass, at other seasons it bears little but camel-thorn. Cultivation is almost entirely limited to the neighbourhood of the rivers and canals. The country near the river-banks is intersected by frequent channels, great and small, carrying more or less water, or sometimes none at all, according to the season of the year. Some of the larger canals, the remains of the former Mesopotamia!! irriga tion-system, carry water in flood-time far into the interior of the plain. Under Turkish rule the cutting of new channels was prac tised by the Arabs at their pleasure. In years of good or fair rainfall there is some inconsiderable cultivation, here and there, in places where only rain-water is available. (b) The Hill-country bordering t PZatam.—From the Persian Gulf near Bandar Dilam up to the neighbourhood of Qasr-i- Shlrin, a distance of some 450 miles, there extends a continuous belt of hill-country, the ranges of which run in a general NW.-SE. direc tion, and rise in succession from the plains of Arabistan and Irak up to the high Persian plateau, where the valley-levels are some 4.000— 5,000 ft, above the sea,14 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATUEES On the south-western side of the mountains, towards the plains, is a belt of foot-hills, 500-2,000 ft. high, composed chiefly of sandstone and gypsum. Between their ranges, from NW. to SE., run valleys which are often broad and open, and in spring well covered with grass. Across the hills the streams running down to the plains cut narrow gorges (tangs). The water-supply, though often tainted with sulphur, is generally plentiful except in summer. Timber is scarce. Beyond the foot-hills the higher ranges rise to altitudes of 7,000- 15,000 ft. On the south the Kuhgalu country reaches the neigh bourhood of the Behbehan—Shiraz caravan-route via Basht and Talaspid, which may be taken as the limit of our area in this direc tion. The little-known highlands of the Kuhgalu seem to consist of a plateau which is drained by streams running towards the plains of Behbehan or Arabistan, is traversed from NW. to SE. by lime stone ridges rising to some 8,000-10,000 ft., and is backed on the west by the yet higher Kuh-i-Dina. On the north the Kuhgalu country almost touches the extremity of the great southerly loop formed by the upper Karun. From this part of the Karun valley north-westwards to the Ab-i-Diz extend the ranges of the very rugged Bakhtiyari mountains, 1 rising to about 15,000 ft., and drained by the Karun and its tributaries. Beyond the Ab-i-Diz, and just west of a line drawn from Dizful to Khurramabad, is a rather less difficult country about 50 miles wide from west to east. Here the main ranges are somewhat lower, and between them lie broad valleys, trending NW.-SE., or lines of low hills. Through this part of the mountain-belt break streams from the Persian plateau, whose waters go to form the Karkeh and Diz rivers ; their gorges are generally difficult, and the easiest routes lie over saddles in the ranges. ^ To the north-west, again, of this easier country, beginning from the Kebir Kuh, are the lofty and rugged mountains which lie between the Tigris plains on the south-west and the valley of the Saidmarreh on the north-east; here the tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh, the lower hill-country bordering the Tigris plains, have their summer quarters. At the northern end of these mountains the ranges sink to the upland plains of Qasr-i-Shlrln and Zohab. The mountain- country as a whole is well watered. The high summer pasture- grounds of the nomad tribes, which they frequent when the grass in 1 On the southern fringe of these mountains, near the extremity of the Karun loop mentioned above, and somewhat south of the Lynch Road, the ranges appear to be lower and the valleys more open than elsewhere in fche Bakhtiyari country. A good alignment for a road from the plains of Arabistan to Isfahan has recently been reported to exist here tBOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 15 the lower valleys is burnt up, lie among its ranges or on its northern side upon the Persian plateau. The south-western side of the country is somewhat sparsely wooded ; much destruction of timber has been caused by the nomads. Some 110-130 miles NE. of Baghdad, where the Sir wan (upper Diyaleh), the Alvand, and the Quretu descend from the Jrersian plateau, the mountains of the plateau-edge sink to low hill- ranges (largely gypsum and sandstone) or to rolling plains. The Qasr-i-Shlrln and Zohab plains form a kind of bay running up into the mountains from Mesopotamia. North of the Zohab district the mils rise again up to the Avroman Dagh beyond the Sirwan. East and south-east of Zohab there are ranges of considerable height traversing the plateau from NW. to SE., but an easy line can be tound to Kirmanshah by making a detour to south-east down the Jvarmd valley As has been already mentioned, this depression in the borderland ranges affords by far the easiest approach from Meso potamia to the Persian plateau. Its plains and valleys are generallv well watered, and in parts are fairly well cultivated. (c) The Desert South and West of Euphrates.—The Arabian Desert, where it borders on south-western Irak, is a fairly hard gravelly plain, broken in places by belts and patches of sand Its general slope is towards the north and north-east, and it terminates in a drop of 50-100 ft. on the edge of the Euphrates valley. It is intersected by wadis (watercourses, dry except after rain) running towards the Euphrates. Here and there are wells and water-holesl their supply is at its best in winter and spring after rainfall. These rams moreover produce some grass-vegetation, which for a time alfords a fair amount of camel-grazing. The usual low desert scrub is also found. West of the Euphrates between Hit and Nejef the southern part of the Syrian Desert (Hamad) has the same general character. Here the desert plateau contains a depression running southwards from the Euphrates near Ramadiyeh (30 miles below Hit) for about 60 miles to the neighbourhood of Kerbela. This depression is divided into wo large basins, a northern and a southern, known respectively as Habbamyeh and Abu Dibis. The Habbaniyeh basin contains a lake about 56 square miles in area, and at the south-east end of the Abu iJibis is the small lake of the same name about 8 miles W of Kerbela. These basins will probably be of importance for the irri- gation ot Mesopotamia as reservoirs in which to store flood-water from the Euphrates and possibly from the Tigris (see further pp. 159,163-4). On the western side of the Abu Dibis depression are the cultivated oases of Shifatheh (or Shetateh) and Rahaliyeh. The former isjBtoflHHBBDMHHBI 16 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES about 35 miles W. of Kerbela. and has an area of about 50 square miles. Rahaliyeh is about 20 miles farther north ; it is much less productive than Shifatheh. Upper Mesopotamia and This division includes (a) the upper plain-country of the JezTreh (' the Island') lying between the middle Euphrates and the middle Tigris, together with the troughs of those rivers bounding it on the west and east, (b)the plains E. of the middle Tigris, (c) the hill- country of southern and central Kurdistan from the Sirwan (upper Diyaleh) valley to the southern shore of Lake Van, the hill- country lying between the northern end of the JezTreh plains and the edge of the Armenian plateau, together with the upland plain of Diarbekr, and (e) the fringe of the Syrian Desert adjoining the middle Euphrates valley on the west. (a) The Plains between the Middle —- Between the southern border of the hill-country (about lat. 37°- 37° 20' N.) and the northern edge of the alluvium of Irak, the plains of the Jezlreh contain about 48,000 square miles. They are generally more or less undulating, though they contain some wide expanses of flat country. Here and there they are traversed by ranges of hills running from east to west or from south-east to north-west. Most of these are quite low, but the Jebel Sinjar, a line of basalt hills W. of Mosul, rises to some 3,000 feet above the surrounding country. The surface of the plains is open and treeless. In the northern Jezlreh numerous stream-beds run down into the plain from the hills, and, though most of these carry little or no water in their lower courses during the summer and early autumn, they help to form the considerable perennial rivers of the Khabur and Belikh, which flow into the Euphrates. Much of the northern Jezlreh has a good soil (e. g. its western part is covered with a brown humus from the Qarajeh Dagh), and large areas could be brought under cultivation by means of irrigation-works. Before the present war, cultivation, though on the increase, was practically confined to certain districts on or near the edges of the plain and to a few areas in the interior where the water-supply was specially plentiful. Insecurity, as well as lack of water, helped to check agricultural development. Great tracts of the northern Jezlreh are covered with rich grass in spring. South of the Jebel Sinjar and the lower Khabur the plain becomes increasingly arid, and towards its lower end turns to a hard desert, the surface of which is composed of gravel, gypsum, marl, borax, or\ BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 17 )0 Ji» sand. There are also large areas in which water from wadis collects Wih and on evaporation leaves an incrustation of salt. It appears that underground supplies of water can be tapped at many places. The southern Jezlreh is traversed for most of its length by the large watercourse known as the Wadi Tartar, which rises near the eastern 111 en ^ ^ ie ^ e ^ el ^ n i ar I'uns southwards to terminate in a saline depression about 40 miles SW. of Samarra. The country near ml the Tartar in the upper part of its course has excellent pasture in ob i spring. The depression at its lower end may possibly prove of use L; as a storage-reservoir for surplus flood-water from the Tigris. ' i ' I D n the western and eastern sides of the Jezlreh the Euphrates and , Tigris have cut for themselves shallow valleys or troughs 1-5 miles miii wide, bordered by low hills or cliffs. At the bottom of these valleys and fit occur stretches of alluvium, where the rivers have deposited their imp sediment in flood-time. Parts of the Euphrates trough are moderately cultivated by means of water-lifts or water-wheels (e .g. in the pa- neighbourhood of Alus, Hadlseh, Anah, Meyyadln, and Deir ez-Zor); i elsewhere the valley is either bare or filled with tamarisk and other thepli 1 scrub. There is a considerable amount of cultivation along the ?•'! banks of the Tigris between Mosul and the mouth of the Great Zab. eipiB Between the two Zabs the villages are few and far between, and S. ssofl of the Lesser Zab the river-valley is mostly empty and untilled ; ist i here, down to the beginning of the alluvial plain near Beled, there ssaltl' is hardly any cultivation except a little round Tekrit, Dur, and 5Willi' Samarra. (6) I'he Plains East of the Middle —These plains slope from lietol the southern Kurdish hills down to the Tigris. They are about ttlejri 40-50 miles broad in their southern part, and narrow to 10-20 miles jiaitiii towards their northern end in the neighbourhood of Mosul, till they 1(0 terminate under the Jebel Abyadh range. Their total length is inotlli about 230 miles. They are traversed by the Adheim, the Lesser ha I* Zab, and the Great Zab, tributaries of the Tigris flowing from the e bnf hills. In the neighbourhood and north of the Great Zab they are je pt®' watered by a number of smaller streams. The southern part of this onfimll country is traversed from SE. to NW. by the rocky sandstone and few# conglomerate range of the Jebel HamrTn (about 400-600 ft. above plenli the plain-levels), which is pierced by the Diyaleh near Delli Abbas, jricuii by the Adheim about 35 miles farther north-west, and by the fereiti Tigris at the Eethah gorge, some 65 miles above Samarra. Between the Zabs the massif of the Qara Chok Dagh rises out of the plain to n be«)i a height of about 2,000 ft. North of the Great Zab the plains are interrupted by the Jebel Maqlub, a large spur from the hill-country boifi, lying about 12-15 miles E. of Mosul, and the immediate neighbour- MES. I B1.8 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES hood of the Tigris above Mosul is sharply undulating and broken by deep ravines. The southern plains are open steppes of clay and gravel, clothed with grass in spring. On the borders of the plain and the hill- country there is some cultivation by settled agriculturists grouped at intervals in or round large villages or small towns. In the interior of the southern plains there are only a few semi-nomads, who raise small patches of crops along the rivers or from rain-water wells else where. North of the Lesser Zab the villages of the semi-nomads become more frequent, and the plain of Erbil, where the better- watered country begins, is comparatively well cultivated by a settled population. The same is true of the plains between the Great Zab and Mosul and to the north of Mosul. The country in the region of the Zabs has a fertile soil and a fair rainfall, and might, it is believed, be made very productive by irrigation. (c) The Highlands of Southern and the Diyaleh valley up to the line Jeziret-ibn-'Omar—Bitlis, Mesopotamia is bounded on the east and north by an arc of high limestone ranges rising to 8,000-13,000 ft. above sea-level. Between these high mountains and the Tigris plains is the lower hill-country, where the altitudes vary from 1,000 to 7,000 ft. above the sea. I (i) The lower hill-country in the southern part of this area, E. of Kufri, Kirkuk, Altun Kdprii, and Erbil, consists either of rolling downs or of lines of rocky heights, in which sandstone predominates. The trend of the hills is generally about NW.-SE. In spring the downs and valleys have much grass on them. The water-supply is fair, but in parts is rather scarce during the summer, when many of the streams dry up altogether. Between this region and the higher ranges are the well-watered upland plains of Suleimaniyeh and Raniyeh. Along the border of the hills from Kufri to north of Kirkuk petroleum appears in places. To the north of Erbil and Mosul the hills of the submontane belt are in general loftier and more rugged than in the down-country farther south. In the basin of the Great Zab, conglomerate and sandstone are found ; more to the north the limestone comes down to the edge of the plain in the Jebel Abyadh range S. of Zakho. The ranges run generally NW.-SE. or E.-W. The valleys are well watered, and some are well wooded. Many of them have a fertile soil and contain cultivation, but the country is much under-popu lated, owing to inter-tribal and inter-racial fighting and raiding. (ii) Along the Persian frontier the high mountain-country of southern Kurdistan, rising to about 11,000 ft. above the sea, is well watered by numerous streams flowing through deep valleys or gorgesBOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 19 into the Lesser Zab, which cuts its way through the ranges from the Persian plateau. The mountain-slopes are well timbered in some regions (for example, in the Avroman, Khoshik and Bamu ranges E. and SE. of Suleimaniyeh); and elsewhere patches of trees and scrub (largely oak) are found in the valley-bottoms and on the slopes, and many of the villages are surrounded by orchards. There are high pasture-grounds, especially on the eastern side of the mountain- belt, which are frequented in summer by nomadic and semi-nomadic Kurds. As elsewhere along the edge of the Persian plateau, the ranges run generally NW.-SE., and the tracks for pack-animals which cross them are all more or less difficult. Their passes are blocked by snow in winter. The high mountains of central Kurdistan cover an area which measures about 80 miles from south to north. On the Mesopotamian side this region may be roughly described as beginning N. of Zakho and Amadiyeh. It stretches up to the southern shore of Lake Van, which lies in the south-eastern corner of the Armenian plateau, at an altitude of over 5,000 ft. above the sea. Central Kurdistan is the most difficult section of the mountain-barrier cutting off Mesopotamia from Armenia and north-west Persia. The highest and most rugged part of this region is that which is traversed by the Great Zab between the plain of Bash Qal'ah on the north and its junction with the Rudbar-i-Shln (E. of Amadiyeh) on the south. Here the mountains E. and W. of the Zab rise to heights of 11,000-14,000 ft. ; their sides are generally barren and sparsely wooded ; the valleys and lower slopes contain patches of cultivable ground, but they are often narrow and rocky gorges. To the north and east of this extremely difficult country the heights of the ranges decrease, and there are many open grassy plains and plateaux used as summer pastures by the Kurds. West of the Zab basin is an intricate complex of mountains rising to 9,000-11,000 ft., watered by many streams, which help to form a number of considerable mountain-rivers—the Khabur, the Hazil, the Rohsur, the Bohtan, and the Bitlis; these latter drain southwards and westwards to the Tigris. The valleys in this country are often well wooded and fertile. There is a good deal of high pasture-ground on the mountains. (d) The Highlands North of theJesireh of Biarbehr.— The northern hill-country between the Euphrates on the west and the line Jezlret-ibn- Omar—Bitlis on the east falls into three divisions : (i) the hill-country of the Tur Abdin and the Qarajeh Dagh ; (ii) the upland plain of Diarbekr; (iii) the eastern Taurus ranges between the Euphrates and the valley of the Bitlis Su, SW. of Lake Van. b 220 BOIINDAEIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES The Tur Abdin and the Qarajeh Dagh country may be compared to the chord of an arc formed by the eastern Taurus ; between the chord and the arc lie the plain of Diarbekr and the open rolling country which adjoins it. ,,, ,, m (i) The plain of the JezTreh is bounded on the north by the Tur Abdin plateau (E. of Mardln) and by the hill-country which has its centre and highest point in the Qarajeli Dagh (W. ot Mardln). The southern side of the Tur Abdin rises abruptly from the plain. East and north of the plateau lies the valley of the Tigris. On its western side, between it and the spurs of the Qarajeh Dagh country, there is a depression running N. and S. which affords an important line of communication between Diarbekr and the great Mesopotamian plain ; Diarbekr lies at the northern end of this depression, Mardin at the southern. The summit of the Tur Abdin is 3,000-4,000 ft. above the sea and 1,600-2,000 ft. above the plain. It is traversed by rocky ridges, mostly basaltic, covered with low oaks and brushwood. The soil, though much overlaid by stones, is often fertile, but water is scarce in summer. The least stony and best watered part of the plateau is the north-western, towards Diarbekr. North-west of Mardln are the Mazi Dagh and the larger and more important Qarajeh Dagh (alt. 6,070 ft.) with their rocky spurs and out liers. On its southern side this region presents no such abrupt con tinuous wall as does the Tur Abdin; its spurs run out in rocky parallel ridges which separate from each other the fertile districts of Yeiran Shehr, Urfeh-—Harran, and Seruj. The surface of the Qarajeh Dagh is basaltic, and the basalt extends southwards to the neighbour hood of Veiran Shehr; to the south-west the underlying limestone comes to the surface in the ranges of the Tektek Dagh and the Nimrud Dagh, the one E., the other W., of the Urfeh plain. The slopes of the Qarajeh Dagh afford pasture-grounds for Kurdish tribes, but this country contains practically no settled population. Its water-supply is rather scanty in summer. (ii) North and east of Diarbekr lies a country of flat or rolling plains and open downs, watered by the Tigris and by tributaries of that river flowing from the hills on the north. The soil of this country is mainly clay and gravel. Near Diarbekr there are alluvial flats along the Tigris. At present this region is far from being cultivated in proportion to its fertility. An extension of the plains towards the east gives easy communica tion with Zokh, Sairt, and the valley of the Bitlis Su. (iii) The ranges of the eastern Taurus run in a crescent -shaped line between the Euphrates and the valley of the Bitlis Su, SW. of wmmmmmmmmmmmamrnm wmtmrnmrnmBOUNDAEIES AND PHYSICAL FEATUEES 21 Lake Van. They rise to about 7,000-9,000 ft., and are formed mainly of Archaean crystalline schists, with Eocene rocks (limestone and sandstone) on their lower slopes, and large outcrops of volcanic rock appearing here and there. West of Bitlis the mountain-belt broadens out in the Sassun country, which before the war contained a considerable number of Armenian villages. The main crossings of the eastern Taurus leading from Mesopotamia to western Armenia are the Arghana defile NW. of Diarbekr, the Kulp valley 50 miles W. of Bitlis, and the Bitlis Pass and valley. (e) The Syrian Desert. —The country bordering the middle Euphrates valley on the west is arid desert in its southern part, and becomes gradually less arid towards the north, until, above the line Raqqah—Hama, more or less cultivable soil is reached. The country N. of this line up to the foot of the Taurus is described in the Handbook of Syria and Palestine. The Syrian I)esert(Hamad)is a plain sloping towards the Euphrates, and at its eastern edge falling away in a drop of some 100-200 ft. to the bottom of the Euphrates trough. The plain is broken here and there by ranges of low hills. The surface is generally sand or shingle, varied here and there by outcrops of volcanic rock. In the spring wide areas are covered with grass, which withers a few weeks later in the heat ot early summer. Wells and water-holes are very scarce in the southern Hamad (as, for instance, between Hit and Damascus), and are somewhat more frequent in the northern desert, as on the line Deir ez-Zor-—Damascus. The wadis (watercourses) which inter sect the plain are generally dry except for a few hours after rain. The water-supply is at its best in spring. Eiver System The Euphrates and the Tigris are the channels through which drainage from the Armenian tableland, from the western side of the Persian plateau, from the hill-country of northern Mesopotamia, and from the upper Mesopotamian plains is carried into the Persian Gulf. The Karun and the smaller streams to the east of it bring down to the gulf the drainage from the south-western side of the Persian plateau. The common outlet of the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Karun on to the gulf is the Shatt el-Arab. On the navigation of these rivers see pp. 280-7. The Euphrates The main sources of the Euphrates are two considerable streams (the Qara or Erat Su and the Mui-ad Su), which, after traversing the22 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES Armenian plateau from east to west, join their waters near its south western corner, some 25 miles WNW. of Kharput. From the junction of these two rivers the Euphrates cuts its way southwards through the Taurus in a series of gorges, and, alter emerging from the moun tains, flows, on a course of about 650 miles, in a shallow valley or trough between the western edge of upper Mesopotamia on one side and northern Syria and the Syrian Desert on the other. At Hit it enters the alluvial bed in which it flows thence to the sea. It passes along the western and southern sides of the alluvial plain of Irak, ap proaching to within 25 miles of the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Ctesiphon, but again diverging from that river. Its waters divide into branches and spill over marshes and broads, until, about 400 miles by river below Hit, what remains of them joins the waters of the Tigris, partly at Kurna, partly at Gurmat c Ali a few miles above Basra. The streams forming the head-waters of the Tigris (the Arghana Su and the Dibeneh Su) rise on the southern edge of the Armenian plateau, just N. of the eastern Taurus and close to the Murad Su. The Arghana Su has its sources S. of Kharput, within a few miles of the Euphrates. The Arghana and the Dibeneh penetrate the barrier of the Taurus and unite in the lowlands of Diarbekr, some 20 miles N. of that town. The Tigris flows along the southern side of the lowlands until, 60 miles below Diarbekr, it enters a succession of gorges between the Tur Abdin plateau to the south and west, and the mountains of central Kurdistan to the north and east. It leaves the mountains near Jeziret-ibn-'Omar, 170 miles below Diarbekr, and thence flows in a trough through the upper Mesopotamian plains, passing by Mosul to Samarra, 340 miles below Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar. Some 15 miles below Samarra it enters its alluvial bed, and follows a course through northern and eastern Irak for about 550 miles. As it proceeds southwards, more and more of its water is spilt into marshes, and, though some of this returns to the main channel, its volume is much reduced by the time a part of the Euphrates is met at Kurna. From Kurna downwards the united waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris are known as the Shatt el-Arab, a large river about 125 miles long, which at Mohammareh, about 48 miles from its mouth, is joined by the greater part of the waters of the Karun. Drainage. —Outside the boundaries of this area the Euphrates drains a large part of the Armenian plateau and the north-eastern corner of Syria. Within this area it receives two large tributaries in upper Mesopotamia, the Belikh and the Khabur. These drain the western and central parts of the northern Jezlreh plain and theBOUNDAETES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 23 ♦ southern slopes of the Qarajeh Dagh hill-country and Tur Abdin plateau, which overlook that plain from the north. Below its junction with the Khabur, 280 miles by river above Hit, the Euphrates receives no tributary river: there are only wadis (water courses), which from time to time bring down to it a part of the rainfall of the Syrian and southern Jezlreh deserts. The Tigris drains, first, the southern side of the Armenian plateau through a number of streams, the most important of which is the Batman Su; secondly, the mountains of central Kurdistan through the Bohtan, the Kohsur, the Hazil, the Khabur, and the Great Zab ; and thirdly, the western side of the Persian plateau through the Great Zab and Lesser Zab, the 'Adheim, the Diyaleh, and the Karkeh. Of these tributaries the Great Zah rises on the Persian frontier east of Lake Van and cuts its way right through the high eastern ranges of the central Kurdish mountains, taking their drainage ; in the southern part of its course, below the neighbourhood of Amadiyeh, it is fed by streams from the eastern side of the Persian plateau and from the lower hill-country E. of Mosul; it joins the Tigris 35 miles below Mosul. The Lesser Zah rises on the Persian plateau, not far from the south-west corner of Lake Urmia, and, after flowing south wards for some 80 miles, breaks through the mountain-barrier S. of Ser Desht and Kaniyeh, and drains the hill-country between Raniyeh and Altun Koprii ; it enters the Tigris 100 miles below Mosul, under the Jebel Hamrln. Just below the point where the Tigris begins to flow over an alluvial bed, the 'Adheim river comes in from the north; this stream, which drains the lower hill-country between Kirkuk, Suleimaniyeh, and Kufri, carries in the dry season little or no water in the lower part of its course. A few miles S. of Baghdad the Tigris is joined by the Diyaleh, known in its upper course as the Sirwan. This river brings water from the provinces of Ardelan and Kirmanshah on the Persian plateau ; most of its supply in the low- w^ter season is used for the irrigation of the country NE. of Baghdad. Below the Diyaleh a number of stream-beds descend into the plains from the hills of the Pusht-i-Kuh. Most of these are dry in the low-water season, but the southernmost of them is the channel of a large river, the Karheh, which drains a considerable area of Luristan. The greater part of the water that descends from the Pusht-i-Kuh towards the Tigris is lost in swamps before it reaches that river, but a certain proportion of the Karkeh water finds its way into the Tigris or into the Shaft el-Arab a few miles below Kurna. High and Low-water Seasons: —The volume of water in the Euphrates and Tigris varies considerably during the year. This variation has most important effects on irrigation and24 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES agriculture, on navigation, on movement by land in Irak, &amp;c. The great increase in the volume of the rivers during certain months is caused by rainfall and melting snow in the highlands of Armenia, Kurdistan, and Persia. The low-water season may be said to last from July to November, the high-water season from December to June. The Tigris is at its lowest in Irak in October, and throughout most of November. Towards the end of the latter month and in December there may be irregular rises due to rainstorms over a wide area, and the river may even (exceptionally) touch overflow level. In January the regular rise of the river begins, and in this month and in February it may reach overflow levels for short periods. In the latter half of March or at the beginning of April come the great floods of spring, when the river is at its highest. Throughout May and June it is steadily falling, and in July the low-water season may be considered to begin, the river continuing to decrease. The rise and fall of the Euphrates take a similar general course, but its spring floods are about a week later than those of the Tigris. Both rivers, and especially the Tigris, are liable to rise in sudden and violent spates. By far the greater part of the water that passes Baghdad and Hindiyeh is spilt into marshes farther downstream and lost by evaporation. In the flood months of March, April, and May the average dis charge of the Tigris at Baghdad is about 100,000 cusecs 1 , but fox- short periods the river may discharge as much as 250,000 cusecs. In the low-water months of August, September, and October the average is about 10,600 cusecs. At Kut el-Amara, while the low- water discharge is about the same as at Baghdad, the flood discharge is greater (about 160,000 cusecs ?) owing to the contribution received in high water from the Diyaleh, which in low water is dry. Between Kut el-Amara and Qal'at Salih the volume of the Tigris is enormously reduced by spills and distribution through canals. As far as Amara the reduction occurs chiefly in the flood season: thus at Amara above the Jehaleh (Chahala) canal the average flood discharge is only 35,000 cusecs; the low-water discharge is about 10,100 cusecs. Between Amara and Qal'at Salih the great canals have been taking off much water in the low season as well as in flood j thus the flood discharge at Amara below the Jehaleh canal was recently reported to be 20,000 cusecs, the low-water discharge 5,600 cusecs, while for Qal'at Salih the figures were 4,000 cusecs in flood and 2,800 cusecs in a low river. Below Qal'at Salih there is an increase in the volume of the river due to a return of water from the marshes; at Ezra's Tomb the flood discharge is 13,400 cusecs, 1 Cusecs — cubic feet per second.(5) BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATUEES 25 the low-water discharge 7,700. At Kurna the river discharges about 28,000 cusecs in flood. In northern Irak the Euphrates has a smaller discharge than the Tigris in the flood months ; the average for the Euphrates on the section Hit—Hindiyeh is about 87,000 cusecs against 100,000 for the Tigris at Baghdad. Moreover the Euphrates in its most violent flood does not rise here much beyond 160,000 cusecs. On the other hand in the months of low water the discharge of the Euphrates in northern Irak is somewhat greater than that of the Tigris (about 14,000fcusecs against 10,600 cusecs). Both rivers bring down a great quantity of sediment in the high- water season. In lower Mesopotamia part of this sediment forms shifting banks in the channels, part is deposited in marshes or lakes or in irrigation-channels. By the time the two rivers meet at Kurna both have lost most of their silt, the Euphrates especially being comparatively clear in its lower course. Effect oft loods in IraJc, —In upper Mesopotamia the floods of the Euphrates and the Tigris are contained in their valleys or troughs. They flood low foreshores in the bottom of their troughs, but do not spread very far. In the alluvium of lower Mesopotamia on the other hand the water of the rivers spreads out in great inundations, and has been known to change its main channel. Here the river beds are not nearly capable of taking all the flood-season discharge ; the soft alluvial soil is easily penetrated, and the ground-levels, which' are below the high-flood levels of the rivers, fall gradually away from the banks. Moreover, since the former irrigation-system was de- stroyed in the Middle Ages, the slight and partial attempts to control the flow of the water have not only been inadequate, but have often made matters worse. Before the present war the Turkish authori ties tried by means of bunds (dykes and dams) to limit the floods round Baghdad, and they had the Hindiyeh Barrage and Hilla Regulator built for the distribution of the water between the two main branches into which the Euphrates divides below Museyib. Elsewhere the only protective works were small and weak earthen dykes along the river-banks. The Arabs were left to cut canals, build dams, and reclaim land along the river-banks to suit their private and local needs, and their work often had disastrous effects. Only by the construction of a system of barrages and escapes at the head of the alluvial plain (that is, between Hit and Eellujeh on the Euphrates and in the neighbourhood of Samarra on the Tigris) can excessive flooding be effectively prevented in Irak. The amount of spill which occurs at this point or that, and the position and extent of the inundations, vary more or less from vear26 BOUNDAEIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES to year, according to the volume of the flood, the way in which it rises, and the obstacles or opportunities which it encounters. Condi tions are constantly changing, and until the Euphrates and Tigris are properly controlled they may always be expected to present new problems. The Euphrates between Eellujeh and Diwaniyeh flows at a higher level than the Tigris between Baghdad and Kut el-Amara, and the country between the rivers in north-western Irak is therefore flooded mainly from the Euphrates. The flood-water finds its way through long canals, the relics of the old irrigation-system, far into the interior of the plain, and there forms shallow marshes. Just below Museyib (70 miles by river below Eellujeh) the Euphrates bifurcates into two large branches, called the Hindiyeh and the Hilla, which join again 110 miles to the south-south-east near Samaweh. In the past the main volume of water has flowed now in one, now in another of these branches. Between 1865 and 1890 the main stream shifted from the eastern (Hilla) branch to the western (Hindiyeh). After several unsuccessful attempts to check the process, which was thi'eatening to dry up the Hilla branch altogether, the new Hindiyeh Barrage and the Hilla Regulator were constructed (1913) to regulate the flow of water down the two channels. On the Hindiyeh branch the Euphrates spreads out in large reedy marshes and broads, where the Euphrates deposits much of its sediment. Below the junction -of the two branches at Samaweh the Euphrates again flows in a single channel past Nasirlyeh to the neighbourhood of Suq esh- Shuyukh. From here part of the Euphrates water flows eastwards to Kurna, where the Tigris is met. But from Nasirlyeh downwards the Euphrates, now flowing at a lower level than the Tigris, receives from the north a great quantity of Tigris water, which finds its way through the canals and marshes between the two rivers. The volume of the Euphrates, thus increased, is beyond the capacity of the channel leading to Kurna (called the Old Channel), and most of the Euphrates water is forced southwards and south-eastwards, and lor ins a large area of open water and swamp, through which the New Channel drains into the Shatt el-'Arab at Gurmat 'All, a few miles above Basra. The Tigris is liable to flood more or less of the neighbourhood of its banks from above Baghdad down to Kut el-Amara. At the latter place a large channel, the Shatt el-Hai, branches southwards from the right bank of the Tigris, and in the months of high river carries off a considerable quantity of water, which eventually reaches the Euphrates below Nasirlyeh by various outlets. The Shatt el-Hai was the main bed of the Tigris from the seventh to the sixteenthBOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 27 century; at present it is dry during the low-water season (from about July to about February). Below Kut el-Amara more and more flood-water drains southwards into swamps, and from just above Amara to Qal'at Salih an enormous amount of water is taken off from the river by large canals, and it has been feared that, unless preventive measures were taken, the Tigris might altogether leave its present bed below Amara. Great permanent marshes are formed on both sides of the river, and between Qal'at Salih and Ezra's Tomb the Tigris is reduced to a narrow, winding channel. Part of the water spilt from the right bank of the Tigris drains down into the Euphrates between Nasirlyeh and Kurna; much water in the marshes E. and W. of the Tigris is lost there by evaporation ; much returns through many channels into the Tigris between Ezra's Tomb and Kurna. Conditions affecting Navigation. —In upper Mesopotamia the general physical conditions affecting navigation on the Tigris and the Euphrates are the swiftness of the current, due to a comparatively steep fall, and the presence in the river-beds of rocks and ledges of shingle, causing rapids and shallows. As waterways therefore the middle Euphrates and middle Tigris have been used almost entirely for down-stream traffic by flat-bottomed boats or rafts (see further pp. 286-7, 290-2). In lower Mesopotamia the inferiority of the Euphrates to the Tigris as a waterway is due to the greater dispersion of the Euphrates water in branches, canals, and broads. This dispersion has left the lower Euphrates very shallow in parts during the low-water season, with a slack current, which has enabled the silt to form here and there in bars, over which there is very little water. The Tigris loses much of its water in spills, and has its banks of silt, which give trouble in a low river, and its narrows in its lower reaches, which are difficult at all seasons, but it keeps a greater proportion of water in one bed than does the Euphrates, and flows more strongly, and therefore has better depths in the months of low river. The Tigris, as a waterway, is capable of improvement by a thorough training of its channel and by the limitation of the amount of water distributed through canals so far as may be consistent with the needs of irrigation. Measures have already been taken to preserve and improve the river in the narrows between Amara and Qal'at Salih. As regards the Euphrates, a scheme has been proposed for the restoration of the old channel between Kurna and Suq esh-Shuyukh, For the obstacles to navigation formed by the old and new Hindiyeh Barrages and by the Hilla Regulator see pp. 283-4.28 BOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES The Karun, Jerrahi, Hindiyan The Karun, rising in the Bakhtiyari country, about 100 miles W. of Isfahan, flows in a winding course (at first SE. and then NW.) through deep valleys and gorges among the Bakhtiyari mountains, till it emerges from the hills above Shushtar ; thence it flows southwards through the plains of Arabistan. Below Shushtar it divides into two arms—the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar—which join again at Band-i-Qir 32 miles farther south. After breaking in a series of rapids through the sandstone hills at Ahwaz (where it drops about 7-8 ft. in 2,000 5 r ds.), the Karun winds for about 115 miles through the alluvial flats of southern Arabistan, It discharges most of its water into the Shatt el-Arab at Mohammareh ; part finds its way to the sea through the Bahman Shir channel, which takes off from the main stream a few miles above Mohammareh and reaches the Persian Gulf 12 miles E. of the Shatt el-Arab. The Karun drains the Bakhtiyari country, and through its tribu tary, the Diz, a large part of eastern Luristan. One parent branch of the Diz rises near Burujird in north-eastern Luristan, and, after a southerly course, breaks through the mountains N. of Dizful. About 32 miles above Dizful it is joined from the east by the other parent branch which flows through the mountains from Earidan. Both of these branches are called the Diz ; the easterly one is also known as the Gand. Their united waters, after passing Dizful, flow into the Karun at Band-i-Qlr. The seasonal vax'iations of volume on the Karun follow the same general course as those on the Euphrates and Tigris (see p. 24), but it is even more subject than they are to sudden irregular rises. In southern Arabistan the Karun floods, escaping by side channels, form patches of marsh in the country along its course ; but compared with the lower Tigris and Euphrates the lower Karun is well contained by its bed. The rapids at Ahwaz are practically unnavigable. Below them there are good depths for navigation by river-craft. Above them the river is navigable to within a few miles of Shushtar (see further p. 285). The Jerrahi and Hindiyan are comparatively unimportant, but they and their tributaries water fertile districts (e. g. Ramuz, Eella- hlyeh, and Behbehan). The Jerrahi is formed in the Ramuz district in eastern Arabistan by two streams, the Ab-i-Ramuz from the northern part of the Kuhgalu country and the Marun from Behbehan. After winding through the plains it reaches the Eellahlyeh district, where it irrigates and floods a considerable area, breaking up into a net work of water-cuts. Its main channel here becomes the Eellahlyeh Marid canal, which connects with the lower Karun, about 15 milesBOUNDARIES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES 29 above Mohammareh. The Jerrahi has no outlet of any size on the id | Persian Gulf. The Hindlyan is formed by two streams from the highlands east and east-south-east of Behbehan, which water part of the Behbehan plain and unite some 22 miles N. of Bandar Dilam. It flows with a deep and rapid course through the Zaidan plain and past Hindlyan village, to reach the Gulf some 70 miles E. of the mouth of the Shatt el-Arab. Its estuary lies among mud-flats, and is encumbered by shoals. Only native craft of 20-30 tons use the river, navigating up to Hindlyan village, a distance of some 32 miles by water. Coast This area touches the sea only on a narrow front at the head of the Persian Gulf. Here the coast of the alluvial plains of Irak and Arabistan, wedged in between the north-eastern corner of the Arabian Desert and the south-western corner of the Persian plateau, extends for about 130 miles from the mouth of the Khor Zobeir on the west to a point between the mouth of the Hindlyan river and Bandar Dilam on the east. This coast is low and marshy, liable to flood, and fringed with flat mud-banks or islands, which have been formed by silt brought down by the rivers. The openings in it are the river- i mouths, obstructed by bars of mud, and three or four long inlets. Beyond the western end of this coast-line the large alluvial island of Bubayan masks the higher Arabian coast between the Khor a Zobeir and the Bay of Koweit. It is at Koweit Bay that the Arabian |t Desert first fronts the open Gulf. The northern side of the bay is s, bordered by hills some 150-400 ft. high ; a gently undulating sandy ,i plain lies to the west and south. g. Eastwards the coast of Arabistan is succeeded by a strip of low alluvial land, a few miles wide, running SE. between the Gulf and the foot-hills of the Persian plateau to Bushire. ^ Shallows and mud-banks make the coast of Irak and Arabistan ,i difficult to approach from the gulf. The bar at the mouth of the I Shatt el-'Arab needs dredging to make it passable at all tides by [j large ocean-going steamers. Between the Shatt el-'Arab and Bushire jl there are no natural harbours for large vessels. West of the Shatt el-'Arab the Khor Zobeir, which runs up into the desert towards j, Basra, has fairly deep water within 20 or 25 miles of Basra, but its ^ approaches from land and sea, its configuration and dimensions, appear to make it unsuitable for regular use as a harbour (see j further Vol. II, Boute I C). The important harbour of Koweit is ( l 50-60 miles SW. of the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab. Desert, marsh, and inundation make the coast difficult of access from the land side.CHAPTER II CLIMATE Introduction—Upper Mesopotamia—Lower Mesopotamia—Conditions affecting aviat ion—Tab 1 es. Introduction The climatic conditions of Mesopotamia are those of a subtropical area which lies at a distance from any ocean, and therefore are of a semi-arid type, although an appreciable amount of rain falls in the winter months. In the winter the atmospheric pressure is compara tively high over northern Syria and Mesopotamia, since they lie on the outskirts of the great high-pressure system of central Asia ; and, while the air-currents at this season are somewhat variable in their directions, winds from the north-west predominate in all parts of the country. Eain occurs during the passage of cyclonic depressions, some of which come from the eastern Mediterranean, and others probably pass across Asia Minor, but at other times the north-westerly winds descending from the high plateau to the northward arrive at the low- lying JezTreh as dry and comparatively warm winds. In summer this effect is ipore strongly marked, and these north-westerly winds, warmed by their descent from the plateau and in their passage to lower latitudes, sweep over the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates as hot, dry winds, which blow fairly continuously from May until October. At this season the great low-pressure area of north-west India, which is related to the monsoon of the Indian Ocean, extends to the Persian Gulf, and the pressure gradient which exists from the eastern Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf maintains this flow of air over Mesopotamia throughout these months. Consequently the land depends on the waters of its two great rivers for its fertility, since the rainfall alone is insufficient to maintain vegetation through the summer. Drawing their supply largely from the snowfall in the mountains of Armenia, the levels of the Tigris and Euphrates increase in the spring months, and begin to diminishCLIMATE 31 as midsummer approaches. As in Egypt, the cultivator is dependent on the water of the rivers for bringing his crops to maturity, but in Mesopotamia they are at their highest in April and May, whereas the rains of Abyssinia from June to September produce the annual Nile flood of Egypt in August and September. In a region so sparsely inhabited and so little civilized as Meso potamia, the places at which meteorological observations have been made are naturally few. Some have been carried on for short periods among the foot-hills of the Taurus in the northern portion of the basin of the Euphrates, while others have been made for longer periods at Baghdad and Basra, and have been published in the Meteorological Reports of the Indian Government. Besides these, a series of observations which extends over six years has been made at Babylon. We have therefore meteorological observations from the following places in Mesopotamia, but they are too few in number and extend over too limited periods to represent adequately the extensive basin of the Tigris and the Euphrates : Place, Period of Observations.

Those marked with an asterisk are taken from the Eoyal Geographical Society's map of 1910, the other value being that quoted in the observations.32 CLIMATE Of these twelve stations 'Aintab, Urfeh, and Diarbekr represent the climate of the hilly country which lies immediately to the southward of the mountain-ranges extending from the Gulf of Iskanderun on the west to Lake Van on the east. This region, which forms a part of the upper basins of the Euphrates and the Tigris, lies at an altitude of 1,500 to 3,000 feet, while many of the hills rise to greater heights. At Aintab the observations, which relate to rainfall only, extend over thirty-two years. At Urfeh and Diarbekr the periods are'shorter being seven (1900-6) and two to four years (1901-5) respectively, but the observations are more complete and include all climatic factors. Situated on the banks of the Tigris, about 100 miles farther south than Diarbekr and more to the eastward, is Mosul, where observations have been made for three to four years (1908-11). This town, which is about 900 feet above sea-level, represents the climate of the southern part of upper Mesopotamia, where more arid conditions prevail than in the foot-hills. At Mosul itself the winter rainfall is considerable, but in the Jezlreh it decreases gradually as the hill-country is left behind. Upper Mesopotamia Temperature (Tables I-VII, pp. 44-9) rhe coldest month is January, while the hottest is July or August, there being but little difference between these two months. The mean temperature of the day (Table I) varies from about 40° F. in January (31 F. at Diarbekr) to about 90° F. in July and August, the increase being at the rate of about ten degrees per month from April onwards. September sees a definite reduction of temperature after e summer heat, and in October and November the temperature diminishes rapidly. The difference between the temperature at Mosul and that of the s a ions m the hills is not very apparent in the mean temperature, but is clearly seen in the daily and monthly extremes (Tables II-VI). ine mean daily maximum temperature in Mosul in July is 110° F., u- 01 ™ ian Diarbekr, while the mean monthly maximum, the highest temperature which may ordinarily be expected in the men is -6 F., or 11 and 12° above that recorded at Diarbekr and Urfeh respectively. _ rail ^.i ow tmperatuies occur at all these stations annually, the mean daily minimum being 264° F. at Diarbekr and 82° F. at Mosul » anuaiy, 3ut occasionally much lower readings are recorded. The mean monthly minimum in January is 27-1° F. at Urfeh, 19-2 0 F. atCLIMATE 33 Mosul, and even 10-9 0 F. at Diarbekr. This severe cold at Diarbekr is doubtless due to its position in a basin, into which the cold air drains from the surrounding mountains. The lowest and highest temperatures which have been recorded show the same wide range, though the observations have not yet extended over a long period, seven years being available for Urfeh, but from two to four for Diarbekr, and from three to four years for Mosul.

If, however, the difference between the lowest mean monthly minimum and the highest mean monthly maximum (Tables III and VI, pp. 44-6 and 46-7), that is, between the lowest and highest temperatures which may ordinarily be expected in any year, be taken, the annual range is: for Urfeh, 77-1 0 F.; for Diarbekr, 944° F. ; and for Mosul, 974° F. Rainfall (Tables IX and X, pp. 50-1) In upper Mesopotamia the rainfall is moderately plentiful at stations in and near the mountains, but it diminishes rapidly towards the alluvial plain of the Euphrates and Tigris. The station of 'Aintab, which is situated in the hills about 60 miles to the north of Aleppo, has an average annual rainfall of 22-06 inches, as deduced from a series of observations which extends over 32 years (Table IX, p. 60). The greatest amount of rain falls in December (443 inches), while more than 3 inches are recorded in November, January, and February. The months of July, August, and September are rainless, while the average rainfall in June is only 0-24 inch. At the other stations the observations are probably too few as yet to furnish satisfactory averages, but they all show the heaviest rainfall as occurring in March, with a secondary maximum in December at Urfeh, and in November at Diarbekr and Mosul. This MES. I 034 CLIMATE approximates to the yearly distribution of rainfall at stations in western Persia. The number of rainy days shows maxima in the same months (Table X, p. 50), and call for no special remark. Snow occurs in upper Mesopotamia in December and January, and sometimes in February and March as well. It is recorded on eight days on the average at Diarbekr and on two at Urfeh during the winter. Humidity (Table VIII, p. 48) The mean relative humidity at Urfeh is remarkably low and, if the figures are correct, must be ascribed to the /67m effect when the winds blow from the northward over the high mountain-ranges of Asia Minor and descend to the much lower level of the basin of the Euphrates as warm and dry winds. In summer the humidity is particularly low, being from 26 to 29 per cent. At Mosul it is considerably higher, especially in December and January. Thunderstorms (Table XII ? p. 54) Thunderstorms are moderately common, and occur most frequently in April and May, when the average number for the month is 4 at Diarbekr and 3 at Urfeh, the average number in the year being 14-6 at the former and 10-3 at the latter place. Cloud (Table XIII, p. 54) Observations of the amount of cloud are available from Urfeh, and also from Mosul, where observations were made three times daily. While the summer months, June to September, are almost cloudless, the amount increases rapidly in the autumn, until during the winter months the mean amount is from 4 to 5, Mosul showing a maximum of 5 to 6 in April (Table XIII, p. 54), on a scale in which 10 represents a completely overcast sky. Lower Mesopotamia The northern portion of lower Mesopotamia extends from about Baghdad on the Tigris to Kurna at the junction of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and its extremely hot and dry climate is represented by the meteorological observations which have been taken at Baghdad and Babylon. At Baghdad these extend over a period of twenty-one years, while at Babylon they were made regularly for six years by an archaeological mission which was carrying out excavations there.© CLIMATE 35 To the south of the junction of the two rivers at Kurna the climate becomes very damp as well as hot, and heavy dews are of frequent occurrence, the conditions approximating to those of the Persian V * a 1 sra ' a statin where meteorological observations were made for eleven years before the war, represents this portion of the country, while some observations made during four months in the summer of 1885 at Mohammareh are also available. Temperature (Tables I to VII, pp. 44-9) In lower Mesopotamia the mean temperature ranges from 47° F in January to 95° R in July, while at Baghdad and Basra the range is somewhat less. December, January, and February are the coldest months; from March onwards the temperature rises steadily at the rate of about 10 F. per month until June. June, July, and ugiist ar e the hottest months of the year, the maximum usually lalling in July or August. As is to be expected in this semi-arid region, the maximum tem- ? e ^no r ^ S ? re Ver y The mean daily maximum is from 57° F ^ ua a ln 1 Jar T7' and rises to 1100 F - and 111° F. in August at Baghdad and Babylon, and to 104° F. at Basra. The mean monthly maximum temperature for August is considerably higher being 119-5 F. at Baghdad, while the highest temperatures which had been recorded at these four stations up to 1914 are 121-3° F at Babylon and 121-0° F. at Baghdad in August. While such high temperatures are annually experienced in the summer, frost occurs occasionally in December, January, and February. The mean monthly ^minimum temperature in January is 27-5° F. for Baghdad and 26-1 F. at Babylon, while the lowest temperatures which had been recorded before 1914 are 18-6° F. for Baghdad and 18-9° F for Babylon. The extreme annual range of temperature is hardly so great as in upper Mesopotamia, although the maximum in August is higher since the minimum in January is not nearly so low as, for instance' at Diarbekr.

Rainfall (Table IX, p. 50) While the rainfall of lower Mesopotamia is less than that of upper Mesopotamia, still an inch of rain usually falls in each of three months of the year. At Baghdad and Babylon the largest rainfall is in March, while at Basra the total for January is the highest, being thus intermediate between the later date of the maximum rainfall at places in northern Irak, and December, when the heaviest rainfall at places in the Persian Gulf is recorded. The total amount is not large at any station, ranging on the average from 4 to 7 inches. June to September are practically rainless, and in April, May, and October the amount which falls is small. The rain days are consequently few (see Table X, p. 50), the highest average number being 3-6 in March at Baghdad and in December and January at Babylon, while at Basra it is 2-6 in January. Snow falls occasionally, and as many as four days of snow were recorded in January, 1912, at Babylon. Humidity (Table VIII, p. 48) The mean relative humidity at Baghdad lies between 60 and 80 per cent, from November to April, but falls much lower in the summer, and is only 38 per cent, in June, from which it rises slowly to 44 per cent, in September. At Babylon the values are lower. Here, even in the winter, very low relative humidities occur, 10 per cent, or less having been recorded in every month except December and January during the period 1907-11. Thunderstorms (Table XII, p. 54) Thunderstorms appear to be rather frequent, for at Babylon, which is the only place at which they have been regularly recorded, they show a well-marked maximum in April and May, when nearly five occur on an average. During the five years over which the observations extended, 8 occurred in April of one year and 10 in May of another. In July, August, and September none occurred, and only a few in the autumn.CLIMATE 37 Cloud (Table XIII, p. 54) 9011 Cloudiness is naturally much less in the arid climate of southern Mesopotamia than under the somewhat moister conditions of the country to the north of Baghdad. Both that station and Babylon, however, show a well-marked cloudy season from December to April, while from June to September the sky is almost cloudless. j A similar annual variation of cloudiness is noticeable at the northern • : end of the Persian Gulf, while at places nearer to the Indian Ocean, e'ifVi as Jask and Muscat, July and August are months of much e( j | Before the war the winds of Mesopotamia had been observed at five «» stations, viz. Urfeh, Mosul, Baghdad, Babylon, and Basra; but at J Baghdad and Basra the observations were made at 8 a.m. only, while at the other places three observations daily—at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and p, 7 p.m. or 8.30 p.m.—are available, and give a better representation , s , t of the air movement. ipfpihop The mean wind directions for each month, expressed as per centages of the total directions observed in the month, are given in Table XI, p. 52, where it will be seen that the dominant wind direction in all months is the north-west, inclining at one time more to the west and at another to the north. In the summer the north-west wind shows the greatest steadiness at all stations, when it reaches a frequency percentage of 70 to 80. In winter and Jn spring the southerly and easterly winds attain their greatest fre- lOMii quency, but there is a recognizable difference at the different stations. At Urfeh calms are not indicated in the observations, and in the JiBi winter months easterly and southerly winds have each about half mi® the frequency of the north-westerly. At this station southerly flit winds are fairly frequent at all seasons, but, as elsewhere, are at the minimum in the summer months. At Mosul calms are few, and the north-westerly winds are still predominant, reaching 77-7 per cent, in the summer months. At that season southerly winds are comparatively rare, but they reach # P er cenfc - i* 1 winter months, and as south-easterly winds con- a tinue into April and May. j At Baghdad the observations were made at 8 a.m. only, and a very . ( || high percentage of calms was recorded—from 584 per cent, in jjp December to 22-9 per cent, in July. This high proportion may be due to local conditions, but also the light airs of the winter 6 mornings have probably been recorded as calms, since Dr. A. Winds (Table XI, pp. 52-4) «r,ik38 CLIMATE t Schlafli, who resided there in 1862-3 and made careful meteoro logical observations, notes that calms are comparatively rare. Even though very light airs prevail in the early morning, the wind rises steadily in the forenoon, and by the early afternoon is blowing freshly, to drop again at sunset, and this diurnal variation in the strength of the wind is a normal condition in all the months of the year except during periods of cold and rainy weather in winter. Southerly winds are frequent in the winter, but they fall to a very small number in the summer months. At Babylon, some seventy miles S. of Baghdad, where observations were taken three times daily for more than five years, hardly any calms were recorded. Southerly winds were frequent in the winter months and in April and May, but were always greatly inferior to the north-westerly winds, which in the summer months reached the proportion of 85-5 per cent At Basra the proportions do not differ greatly from those of the stations higher up the river, but southerly winds have a rather greater prevalence in the summer months than farther northwards. The general character of the air circulation over Mesopotamia is well indicated by these observations. Throughout the year a prevailing current from the north-west sweeps over the country from the hilly country in the north to the shores of the Persian Gulf. This air has for the most part descended from altitudes of 4,000 feet or more on the plateaux of Asia Minor and Kurdistan, and therefore reaches the northern part of upper Mesopotamia as a dry wind. This is clearly indicated by the low value of the relative humidity of Urfeh. Passing southwards and entering suc cessively warmer regions, the air of Mesopotamia is everywhere dry, except in the delta, where the climatic conditions agree closely with those in the Persian Gulf. The frequent occurrence of easterly winds in the northern part of upper Mesopotamia during the winter and spring is probably connected with the occurrence of depressions in the Levant, many of which pass over northern Syria or Palestine into Mesopotamia. Data bearing on the velocity of the wind are very scanty. There is probably a well-marked diurnal variation in both the diiection and the force of the wind in all parts of the country, but the wind directions at the three hours of observation have been published for Babylon only. Here the north-westerly wind of the morning becomes more northerly and even passes to the east of north by the afternoon, especially in the summer months. Except in the cold weather or during the passage of depressions, the increase of wind velocity during the day is usual and is especially markedCLIMATE 39 during the hot months. From light airs at sunrise the wind increases to a moderate breeze by about 10 a.m., and by 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. has become a fresh or even a strong breeze. It is strong enough to raise dust and even sand, so that in the afternoon the horizon is usually obscured. About sunset the wind drops, to rise again an hour or two later as a light breeze, which may continue during the night, falling to a calm before sunrise. The fresh northerly wind {shamal) which blows in summer mitigates to some extent the great heat, and contributes to the decrease of the annual floods in lower Mesopotamia. The main period of the summer shamal is about 20-30 days in length, but it is usually interrupted by a few short breaks. This main period begins as a rule in the first half or middle of June, and is then followed by a few short periods in July and August. But in 1916 the main period began extraordinarily late (July 21). Gales are said to be rare, but probably high winds occur when depressions pass over the country in the rainy season. In the summer the afternoon wind is said occasionally to reach gale force, but this seems to be exceptional. Sandstorms Sandstorms are most common in the spring months. They are strong winds carrying dust and sand like the of Egypt. They are preceded by dull weather of great and oppressive heat and usually by a light wind which grows in force until the sand-cloud which it has raised approaches with great rapidity. During the passage of the sand-cloud, which may last for some hours, the wind often blows with extreme violence. Conditions affecting Aviation Density. —The density of the air in Mesopotamia has been computed for four months of the year, including those of mid-winter and mid summer, and the results are given in the following table: Table op Density in ( t Rammes per Cubic Metre Place, January. April, July. October. Mosul .... 1,233 1,170 1,089 1,149 Baghdad 1,254 1,194 1,127 1,172 Babylon 1,260 1,166 1,121 1,177 Basra .... 1,250 1,185 1,130 1,176 \40 CLIMATE Visibility. —In all hot countries where the ground is heated to a high temperature in the summer months, the air in contact with it is much hotter than that at a short distance above the ground. The density of this layer which is in contact with the ground is conse quently less than that of the upper layers, and all objects seen through these heated layers appear to be below their true position. This effect, known as mirage, leads to a part of the sky being seen as though on the surface of the desert, where it appears to be a sheet of water, and to hills, rocks, and other objects being distorted. Visi bility is thereby greatly interfered with whenever the line of sight is inclined at a small angle to the ground ; for a line of sight from any considerable height this form of interference would not be serious, but when the ground is highly heated, as in the case of a semi-arid and subtropical region, the ascending hot air and the cooler air which descends to take its place will probably produce a general haziness throughout the hottest time of the day. Further, the increased velocity of the wind after midday raises a considerable amount of fine dust which remains in suspense until sunset, and diminishes the visibility of objects at a distance. Clouds are rare in the summer months, and the few that do occur are cirrus clouds which are situated at high altitudes. Occasionally, when unsettled weather is imminent, overcast skies are experienced, but these are uncommon and do not usually last for any time. Temperature. —The difference between the highest and lowest temperatures in any month is very considerable ; the mean range, or the difference which is ordinarily experienced in the course of the various months, is given in the following table : Mean Monthly Eakge of Temperature Month, Mosul. 0 F.

The north-westerly and northerly winds blow with great steadiness, especially in summer, when there is a steep pressure gradient from the north of Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. In consequence of heating, the lower layers of air which are in contact with the ground rise, and in this way a mixing of the lower and upper air takes place as the day advances. The result is that the more rapid motion of the upper layers is imparted to the lower layers with which they are being mixed, and increased velocity of the surface Avind in the midday and afternoon hours is thus brought about. Observations of atmospheric pressure have been made at few places in Mesopotamia, but from these and others in the Persian Gulf, in Syria, Egypt, Arabia, and India the general trend of the isobars can be deduced for the summer months, May to October, when there is a well-defined pressure gradient towards the Persian Gulf. In the winter months the gradient is slight, and the data are insufficient for reliable deductions to be made of the velocity of the upper air-currents. An approximate value can, however, be obtained for the summer months, and the estimated velocity of the winds at from 1,500 to 4,000 feet (gradient wind) is given in the following table:42 CLIMATE Estimated Velocity of the Gradient Wind in Lower Mesopotamia (Baghdad to Basra) June.

Metres per second Miles per hour .... 9.4 21.0 7-0 15.7 5-4 12.1 5-4 12.1 10.9 24.4 Farther eastward these velocities appear to increase to 30-0, 25-6, 24-8, 23-7, and 24-4 miles per hour respectively. In the summer half-year the change of pressure (reduced to sea-level) is comparatively rapid as the Tigris or Euphrates is ascended, and the average increase of pressure for Mesopotamia may be taken as being about 1 mb. for 125 kilometres or 78 statute miles (i.e. about 1 mm. for 164 kilometres or 102 statute miles), in going from the head of the Persian Gulf to upper Mesopotamia. In the months before and after July the gradient is less, but from October to April the distribution of pressure is too imperfectly known for isobars of any reliability to be drawn.TABLES Summary table pages I.

Introduction The available information with regard to the minerals of Meso potamia is very defective. Their exploitation has been hindered by lack of means of transport, by insecurity, and by other causes, and those deposits which have been worked have been dealt with by more or less primitive methods, except where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has undertaken operations. Scientific examination of mineral-fields has been carried out only in a very few parts of the country, and then generally within very narrow limits, and information as to deposits in the hills depends largely on native reports, which are vague, and usually more or less untrue. In these circumstances it is generally impossible to say anything about the probable amount and quality of the deposits, or to do more than indicate the regions in which minerals are reported to exist. The mineral wealth of the area lies mostly in or on the edge of the hill-country to east and north. So far as is known at present, the most important mineral of lower Mesopotamia is the oil which is found mainly in the foot-hills bordering Arabistan and the Tigris plains, but the mountain-country beyond the foot-hills has hardly been examined. In the north uncertain quantities of various solid minerals (iron, copper, lead, coal, &amp;c.) exist in the mountains and hills ; these form an extension of the rich mineral-field of the Aimenian plateau. ^ Lastly, the plains of upper Mesopotamia are in parts petroliferous. Most of the oil probably lies in comparatively accessible districts, fiom which, with the general development of the country, means of transport could be organized more or less easily; but in the higher hills and mountains much labour and expense would generally be needed to provide outlets for the produce of mines. On the exploitation of minerals see pp. 229-31.MINEEALS 57 Coal The areas whence coal is reported are enumerated from south-east to north-west: {a)Coal and lignite occur on the Kuhgalti plateau, and according to native reports there is much ' coal' (which may mean lignite) in the Bakhtiyari mountains. (b)In southern Kurdistan coal is worked at Nasaleh near Kufri (Salahiyeh). There is said to be a good deal of coal in the hills near Halebjeh SE. of Suleimaniyeh. Lignite is fairly common in the , j province of Kirmanshah. (c) On the southern edge of central Kurdistan N. of Mosul de posits of coal exist over a fairly wide area. Here coal is reported in the Dohuk district, at Harbol and Sheranish N. of Zakho, near Sher- ffllsili nakh NW. of Zakho, and farther east in the country N. of Amadiyeh. its There are said to be indications of large quantities of coal near Harbol, etajsi but the quality of what is obtained at present is poor. The Sheranish Mi coal appears to be impregnated with bitumen. According to reports Aijjrfi (apparently native information) a better quality is found in the Jebel itMinli Abyadh in the Dohuk district. {d) Coal is reported vaguely from other parts of central Kurdistan, iliil, as in the districts of Bash Qal'ah. Eurduz, and Sairt. (e) There are seams of coal near Hazro on the lower slopes of the iutni eastern Taurus NE. of Diarbekr. To the south of Diarbekr brown jXjj coal has been noticed near Mardln. jo Nit I, Other Minerals m Iron has been reported in the Kuhgalu district, but is apparently Hit not mentioned as occurring between the most southerly part of uJill the mountain-belt and the Dohuk—Amadiyeh region N. of Mosul, [jj,^ Iron-ore is said to exist in large quantities in the Sergusa hills, four ^ and a half hours to the north of Amadiyeh ; it used to be worked, but insecurity caused the abandonment of the mine. Other deposits are ig j: reported E. of Amadiyeh, and in unnamed localities in the Dohuk Lgjif district. Iron occurs farther north in central Kurdistan, in and near the Bohtan valley ; and oxide of iron is reported from the Dlzeh 20 district towards the Turco-Persian frontier. 1 Lead occurs in central Kurdistan, as in the neighbourhood of Amadiyeh, near Julamerk in the Zab valley, and in the Bohtan l!1 j valley. It is also said to exist farther west, in the eastern Taurus. sel1 ' In the hills S. and SW. of Diarbekr there are lead-mines, reported to be valuable, which have been worked intermittentlv.58 MINERALS Silver-lead is found in central Kurdistan (in the Shattakh district and near Sairt). Silver exists near Amadiyeh, and is reported to be found in the Dohuk district. It used to be mined in the lower Bohtan valley. Gold was formerly worked in the lower Bohtan valley, and may exist in the eastern Taurus. Platinum and zinc are mentioned as occurring in the eastern Taurus. % Copper is found at Arghana Ma'den in the Taurus N'W. of Diarbekr. It was worked there on a considerable scale, though by clumsy methods (see p. 229). Copper and tin are reported from the Shemdinan and Oramar districts in central Kurdistan towards the Persian frontier. In the Dohuk district SW. of Amadiyeh there are said to be copper-ores. An orpiment mine in the Julamerk region was abandoned some forty or fifty years ago owing to lack of transport. Ozokerit is said to be obtainable in large quantities at Gulraman in the Dohuk district. _ There is apparently a good deal of borax in the desert between the rivers NW. of Baghdad and W. of the Euphrates near Kerbela. Borax has been worked at Bash Qal'ah. Suit-fields, where salt is produced over large areas by evaporation, yre frequent in the plains both in Irak and in upper Mesopotamia, and especially in the desert of the Jezlreh between the Jebel Sinjar and Baghdad. In Irak the principal salt-fields S. of Baghdad are those in the neighbourhood of Azlzlyeh, Kerbela, Nejef, Sarnaweh, and Shatrat el-Amareh. There is a less important field near Baghdad outside the Bab et-Tilism. In the Jezlreh N. of Baghdad there is a large field at the southern end of the Wad i Tartar; others are El-Ashkar (80-35 miles SW. of El-Hadhr), El-Edejd (SE. of Meyyadln), and Bevara (ENE. of Meyyadln, S. of the Eoda hills). There are also salt-beds S. of Hit, E. of Samarra, and near Beled Ruz and Mandali. In the northern hills the largest group of salt fields is that round Sairt on the lower Bohtan in central Kurdistan ; the produce obtained here is exported to other districts. Eock-salt occurs at Tuz Khur- matli S. of Kirkuk and elsewhere. Gypsum abounds along the foot-hills under the mountain-belt from the Persian Gulf up to the neighbourhood of Kirkuk. It is also found on the edge of the Arabian Desert and elsewhere in the plains. There is naturally a lack of easily available 6 u ildi) icj - si o} i e in Irak. Below Baghdad stone is to be obtained near Samaweh and at the Jebel Sinam, a volcanic hill some 30 miles SW. of Basra. Lime-MINERALS 59 stone can be quarried at Hit, and accessories for building, as sand, shingle, and lime, can be obtained on the edges of the desert. In upper Mesopotamia the principal quarries are those in the hills near Mosul, where a hard limestone and a soft marble are obtained. Build ing-stone can be found in the Euphrates valley between Feheimeh and Anah, and farther north at Deir ez-Zor and Qishlaq Ma'den. Basalt is common in the hill-country S. of Diarbekr and in parts of the northern Jezlreh plain. Lime plaster and marble are found in Kurdistan along the Turco-Persian borderland. Oil and Bitumen In the southern and central parts of this area there are extensive belts of country where the presence of oil is known or suspected. But the examination of these belts is still on the whole very in complete. Thorough geological examination and testing are being carried out in Arabistan by the experts of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the Hit and Mandali districts have recently been inspected. So far as such investigation goes, the results are said to be promising. But the extent of the supply in any area that has been ' proved' must remain more or less uncertain, and even when a well or group of wells is working and is producing abun dant oil, it is impossible to say how long the yield will last. Else where thorough examination has taken place only at a few scattered points. For the most part there is only a presumption from the general geological structure of the country and from indications of oil or bitumen on the surface ; in such cases the amount of the supply and its economic value are unknown. On the whole there is a fairly good chance that in such a large region, which is certainly or pro bably petroliferous, more or less valuable oil-fields exist besides that of Maidan-i-Naftun, which is now being worked by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but the course of future development remains very uncertain. {a) The P ersian Gulf-— KirTcuTc Sell —From the Persian Gulf north westwards to Kirkuk there extends a belt of country which is in some parts certainly, in others probably, petroliferous. Indications of oil occur in the gypsum and sandstone ranges which form the foot-hills on the south-west side of the Persian mountains. At its southern end this petroliferous country is continued by the oil-line along the northern side of the Persian Gulf at its northern end it may be connected with the petroliferous area of the middle Tigris. There are two parts of this belt which are at present worked: (i) the Shush tar—Ahwaz—Ramuz district: here the Anglo-Persian Oil60 MINERALS Company has its producing field at Maidan-i-Naftun 26-30 miles SE. of Shushtar ; (ii) the Kirkuk—Qasr-i-Shlrln—Mandali region: here oil is known to exist on the Turkish side of the frontier in or close to the hills near Kirkuk, Tuz Khurmatli, Kufri (Salahiyeh), Chlah Surkh, and Mandali, and on the Persian side of the frontier oil and bitumen occur at many places in the area between the Turkish frontier on the west, the Mahidesht neighbourhood on the east, the Sirwan (upper Diyaleh) on the north, and the border of Luristan on the south. Though production has not been attempted on any large scale in the Kirkuk—Qasr-i-Shlrin—Mandali region, some experts are inclined to think that it may prove richer than the Shushtar area. The Neft Khaneh or ' Mandali' field, between Khanikin and Mandali, has been lately examined and has been found to be most promising. Paraffin base oils are present here, and the geological conditions are favourable to the existence of an abundant supply. The field lies at about lat. 34° 2' N., long. 45° 27' E., just on the Turkish side of the Turco-Persian frontier. Between the two areas above mentioned much of south-eastern Luristan and Pusht-i-Kuh is probably petroliferous, and oil is found on the surface in a number of places (e. g. Dehhuran and Dalparri). (6) The Middle Tigris Belt —This belt extends along the Tigris from south of Mosul to the Fethah gorge in the Hamrin hills. At present oil is worked only at Kaiyara about 50 miles by river and 40 miles by road below Mosul. North of Kaiyara there are oil-oozings in the warm springs of Hammam Ali (15 miles S. of Mosul); and at the Pethah gorge there are oil-oozings and bitumen on the rocks near the river. It is possible that the line of the Hamrin hills to north west and south-east of this gorge is also petroliferous. The economic prospects of this area are quite uncertain, but a favourable opinion has been passed by one observer on the possibilities of the Fethah gorge. The area could be made easily accessible from Mosul in the north and from Baghdad in the south along the line of the Tigris. There are indications of oil in the plains W. of this section of the Tigris. Thus there are said to be oil-oozings in the streams flow ing S. from the Toq hills between Tel A'far and Beled Sinjar, and farther south there is an oil-spring at El-Hadhr some 30 miles WNW. of Qal'ah Sherghat. It is uncertain whether the petroliferous area extends across the JezTreh from the Tigris to the Euphrates, and in any case its value is unknown. (c) The Euphrates Belt. —A petroliferous area extends along the Euphrates from the neighbourhood of Ramadiyeh up to an undeter mined point above Deir ez-Zor; there is an indication of oil on the right bank above Lubtar Island 12 miles above Deir. The principalMINEKALS 61 indications (in the form of bituminous springs and lakes) occur in the Hit—Kamadiyeh region. Here, besides the bitumen springs at : Hit, which are worked for the production of pitch, there are bitumen lakes at Abu Jir (or Abu Qir: 30 miles WSW. of Kamadiyeh), at Jebhah (7 miles NW. of Abu Jir), and at Ain el-Awasil (15 miles NW. of Abu Jir). Of these three lakes Abu Jir is much the largest, covering an area of 200 acres. There is also a petroliferous locality at Nafatah on the left bank of the Euphrates, 70 miles W. of Baghdad. The crude oils in the Hit— Ramadiyeh region are asphaltic. The geological conditions are reported to be sufficiently favourable to make the field well worth testing. There are bitumen wells at Tel Mughaiyir S. of Nasirlyeh and again near Koweit. 1 Mineral Waters Over wide areas in this country there is a good deal of sulphur in the water-supply, as in the gypsum country that lies on the southern side of the hills from the Persian Gulf to Kirkuk, and again on the Tigris between Mosul and the Jebel Hamrln, in the neighbourhood of the Jebel Sinjar, and at Ras el-Ain, and in parts of centra] Kurdistan. Some of the sulphurous springs are thermal. Ferruginous waters are found in central Kurdistan ; a large group of thermal ferruginous and cold or thermal sulphurous springs occurs a few miles SW. of Sairt. Gaseous waters (carbonate and bicar bonate of soda) exist at Bitlis and in the valley of the Zab between Julamerk and Bash Qal'ah. Some of the thermal and gaseous springs are frequented for their curative qualities by the inhabitants of neighbouring districts, e.g. the warm sulphurous springs at Hammam Ali S. of Mosul, those S. of Sairt, a carbonated ferruginous spring near Bash Qal'ah, and the carbonated springs of Bitlis. 1 The theory has been put forward by Hofer that the oil-supply of Meso potamia is distributed along four lines : (a) The line Mosul—Persian Gulf. Starting at Hammam 'Ali on the Tigris S. of Mosul, this line would pass through Kirkuk and Tuz Khurmatli to Qasr-i-Shlrin, and on through the Pusht-i-Kuh and the northern borders of Arabistan to the Persian Gulf. (b)The line Kaiyara—Kufri. (c) The line El-Hadhr—Fethah gorge—Mandali. {d} The Euphrates line from Deir to Hit, and on along the edge of the desert bordering the Euphrates valley through Tel Mughaiyir to Koweit. The evidence available seems hardly sufficient either to prove or to disprove this theory.CHAPTER IV FAUNA AND FLOEA Fauna In Mesopotamia there are few kinds of wild animals that are of economic use. Both in the northern and southern plains gazelles, wild pig (in the marshes and the tamarisk jungle along the rivers), and jackals are common. Hyenas, foxes, long-haired desert hares, jerboas, porcu pines, and rats are said to abound in upper Mesopotamia. In Irak and Arabistan hyenas, foxes, hares, porcupines, and jerboas are men tioned as occurring. Wolves are now rare in the plains (especially, it seems, in the south), and the wild ass of upper Mesopotamia has now almost disappeared. There are said to be still a few lions in Arabistan, and perhaps on the Khabur in the western Jezlreh. Of birds ravens, crows, owls, vultures, kites, hawks and falcons, wild pigeons, sand-grouse, partridges, bustard, duck, snipe, quail, and geese are found, and especially the permanent marshes of southern Irak and Arabistan teem with many sorts of aquatic birds—various kinds of duck, bittern, heron, coot, &amp;c. In the rivers there are several kinds of fish, but these are mostly unfit to be eaten, at any rate by Europeans. The best known are the hiss, which is often 6-7 ft. long and over 100 lb. in weight; the shabut, which weighs from 2 to 6 lb.; and the bunni, which is a smaller but better-tasting fish than the Sharks frequent the Shatt el-Arab and the lower Tigris, sometimes reaching Baghdad and even Samarra in the hot season: they are also found in the Karun. Water-tortoises are common. Otters occur in Irak and on the lower Karun, and are sometimes hunted by the natives for their skins. In the mountains the bear (black or brown), the hyena, the lynx, the fox, the wild pig, and the wild goat are fairly common. Leopards and panthers are said to be found here and there in the Persian mountains. Squirrels of various kinds exist, and the marten is trapped for its fur. There are eagles in the higher altitudes. Both the Kurds and the Lurs take honey from wild bees.FAUNA AND FLOEA 63 Mosquitoes are common, especially in the marshy districts, where they are dangerous as carriers of infection. Flies are numerous and troublesome in the summer heats, and may spread disease. Locusts sometimes invade parts of the country, and may cause great destruc tion over wide areas. The plains E. of the Tigris are especially liable to be ravaged by locusts which come in April and May from the Kurdish hills. Poisonous snakes and scorpions are in general fairly common. On domesticated animals see Chapter XI, pp. 182-8. Flora On cultivated plants see Chapter XI, pp. 176-82. In the plains of Mesopotamia the natural vegetation consists chiefly of grass and low-growing plants; wild trees are in general very scarce. In the hills there is a good deal of scattered wooding, and areas of woodland and forest occur ; but on the whole the hill- country is not very rich in timber; much has been destroyed by the wastefulness of the inhabitants. The Great As a very large proportion of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia are dependent on their live-stock for their prosperity and even for their existence, vegetation which supplies grazing is of the first importance. The grasses of the plains are produced by the winter and spring rainfall. They are most abundant in spring (about April), when they cover enormous areas, and are interspersed with many kinds of flowers. In the summer heat they are for the most part soon dried up ; only here and there, where the soil is particularly well watered, as along wadis or rivers, or in oases, is grass to be found in the late summer and early autumn. This decrease of vegetation in the summer drives the Kurds to migrate from the edges of the plain- country to the highlands, while the nomad Arabs occupy the parts of the plains where grazing is still available. There are a number of plants on which camels can find grazing throughout the year, e. g. the thorny plant (camel-thorn), which is very common. 1 In addition to these forage-plants the deserts are dotted here and there with mimosa scrub. 1 Agul is used for cooling rooms or tents in summer. It is made into screens on which water is poured so as to cool the air in its passage.64 FAUNA AND FLOKA Eeeds abound in the marshes, and are used by the inhabitants for matting and for hut-building. Coarse marsh-grasses are also used in the construction of huts. Two natural vegetable products have a commercial value as articles of export, liquorice and colocynth. Liquorice is found near water, generally on the concave side of river-bends. On the Tigris it occurs to some extent in the Diarbekr lowlands, but mainly in the great plains from the neighbourhood of JezIret-ibn-'Omar at least down to the district of Kut el-Amara. On the Euphrates it is found on the middle course of the river in the upper Mesopotamian plain, and in Irak as far down as Diwaniyeh. It also grows on the Khabur (the tributary of the Euphrates), the Zabs, the Diyaleh, the northern end of the Shatt el-Hai, and in Arabistan on the Diz. Colocynth is found in many districts, especially between Baghdad and Hilla; it is said to be inferior to the Syrian colocynth. Wild trees hardly exist except along the rivers and canals. On the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris in Irak there are some groves which have been protected by the Turkish Forests Department, but these are not large. The gharab (Euphrates poplar), a tree of no great size, is comparatively common. A kind of osier called giving a good shade, occurs in Irak. The is fairly common in Arabistan. Mulberries, several kinds of acacia, sumachs, and planes are also found growing wild. There is a good deal of tamarisk jungle or scrub by the rivers, especially in parts of the Euphrates valley in upper Mesopotamia. The Hill-country [including The grass in the lower valleys is mostly burnt up in the course of the summer, but grazing is to be found throughout that season on the high mountain-slopes and plateaux, which form the summer pasture- grounds of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes. Gum-producing plants, and especially the species of yielding gum-tragacanth, grow in Kurdistan, Luristan, and the Bakhtiyari country. Of trees the oak, often in a stunted form, is the most common: there occur ilex, cork-tree, and the from which gall-nuts (an article of export in Kurdistan) are obtained. Walnuts, poplars, junipers, elms, sumachs, mulberries, planes, maples, briars, and hawthorns are also found. Some walnut wood used to be exported to France, and the leaves of the sumach are collected and exported for medicinal and industrial purposes. lUHJi U ■■U.

The spread of cholera and choleraic diarrhoea is much increased by flies. On measures necessary to protect camps, &amp;c., from flies see tamm published by the General Staff, India, 1917 edition, pp. 52-4. A boil which is called by various names (e. g. 'Baghdad boil'Basra , date-mark ) attacks both Europeans and natives in many of the cities. JNatives of the towns where the boil is prevalent are generally attacked , infanc y at an age of from one to three years. Newcomers are almost ! , always attacked within a year of their arrival in a town where the i disease is prevalent. The boil usually appears on the face, hand, wrist, or ankle. It lasts for about a year, causes discomfort, and a* leaves a scar, but is not dangerous. It is believed to be caused by a parasite, called Leishmania, injected by the bite of some noxious * insect, probably a sand-fly. Treatment by carbonic acid snow may » possibly reduce the boil for a time, but in that case it is likely to . I return sooner or later. If the boil is left alone, the disease will not sl» come back when once it has run its course. Natives inoculate the sore on the arm to prevent a disfiguring scar on the face. Outside malaria-infested districts, if proper precautions can be mes. i66 HYGIENE taken against the summer heat, against insects, and against the rather sharp contrasts between day and night temperatures which occur in autumn, winter, and spring, and if, further, such care is taken with regard to water, &amp;c., as is necessary in a country the inhabitants of which are unacquainted with European rules of sanitation, the health conditions for Europeans in Mesopotamia may be regarded as in general fairly good. The winters in the plains and lower hills are bracing; and outside the region of marsh and flood the atmosphere in summer is dry. In the plains both of upper and of lower Mesopotamia the hot weather, which begins in April and ends in September or October, is very trying to European residents as well on account of its length as owing to the very high temperatures which occur in it. During this season European residents in the towns have been accustomed to spend the hottest parts of the day in (underground cellars), with which all the larger, houses are provided. Punkahs also are used. On the hottest days it is almost impossible for Europeans to remain in the upper rooms of houses built in the native style. The flat roofs are used as sleeping quarters in the summer. In Basra the nights are hotter and damper than in Baghdad, and it is advisable to sleep under an awning which serves as protection against the morning dews. Even in Irak the cold of winter, which is often bitter at nights, makes thick clothing necessary. For the hot season, besides thin day and night clothing, spine-pad and topee are essential. ' A good pair of dark or amber glasses with dust-proof sides fitting closely (or motor goggles) are absolutely essential all the year round, as the dust storms are extremely bad, and the glare from the water and desert extremely trying to the eyes.' Mosquito curtains are necessary. The following notes are quoted from Field edition of 1917, p. 287 : ' Water (in Irak).—The river is the best supply, when available ; it is muddy as a rule, and requires sedimentation with alum ; it should always be boiled or chlorinated. The water for drinking purposes should always be taken from the middle of the main stream if possible, and never from the small creeks, which are always badly polluted. The other source of water is from wells on the desert; it is nearly always brackish and very unpleasant to taste and ex tremely hard; a pinch of Soda Bicarb, often improves it; this water is liable to cause diarrhoea. Some of these wells are quite good as far as organic pollution is concerned, but one occasionally finds them polluted with dead cattle.35 HYGIENE 67 Medical. -—-Officers are advised to take the following : A clinical thermometer. Phenacetin. Aspirin. Quinine. Chlorodyne. Cascara. Citronella (for mosquitoes and sandflies). Keating's Powder. A small quantity of alum and bicarbonate of soda.' Among the natives of Irak malaria is the chief endemic disease, « and is especially common in the southern part of that country. It l is prevalent also in certain parts of upper Mesopotamia. * Other diseases, more or less common among the native population Z 0 ! Mesopotamia, are small-pox, diphtheria, dysentery, various diseases p of the eye, typhoid fever, ankylostomiasis, tuberculosis (which is on V * he increase), syphilis and other venereal diseases (especially in the Jta towns ; syphilis is said also to have spread much lately among the fc Kurds). -Bilhamasis occurs in the marshes, and is due to drinking K stagnant marsh-water. There is some leprosy, which is most common in the neighbourhood of Amara in Irak. The hill-tribes suffer very i much from various forms of rheumatism, which is also common in fail Baghdad and other towns in the plains. Epidemics of cholera and if bubonic plague occur from time to time. Under Turkish rule the towns have been left in a most insanitary Mi,I condition.

At Basra the inhabitants have been accustomed to drink isni [he water of the Ashar creek, which serves them also as wash-tub lull®: a u, dustbin, and cesspool. At Baghdad drinking-water is supplied mainly by water-carriers, who draw water from the river, usuallv at ^ pools in the openings in the bank, and bring it thence in skins , r figl earned either on their own backs or by donkeys. Before the war only aboiit SGQ houses were supplied with Tigris water, raised by jsert;i » ^U-b.p oil-engme and distributed through pipes.

In particular, a number of quarantine e 268 HYGIENE stations dealt with the pilgrims to the Shiah shrines of Kerhela and These come every year from Persia, India, and other Moham- medan countries, generally in numbers varying between 150,000 and 200,000. Quarantine is the more necessary as many ot them bring the corpses of their kinsfolk for burial in Nejef. Under the Turkish regime in Irak there was a sanitary department at Baghdad controlled by a medical officer (the or inspector), who received his orders direct from the International Board of Health at Constantinople. One of his principal subordinates was a doctor with three assistants at Khanikin, whose duty it was to inspect all corpses entering the country from Persia for interment at the holy places • there were also establishments for the maintenance of sea quarantine at Fao and Basra. After these the sanitary posts at Neief and Kerbela ranked next in importance, while of the department were stationed also at Amara, Haji Qarah (in the Khanikin kaza), Mandali, Bedrah, Samarra, Kazimain, and Museyib-all places frequented or passed en route by Shiah pilgrims. The department also levied a tax upon all corpses transported for burial, with a view to the upkeep of these sanitary services, which tax must be distin guished from the fees charged at the actual places of burial by the religious authorities according to the sanctity of the locality selected. Sanitation is being introduced into the towns occupied by the British.CHAPTER VI HISTOKY mspij attidi aiteds To 1914 a.d. The kingdoms of ancient Mesopotamia—Mesopotamia under foreign rule • I • The history of Mesopotamia falls into two clear divisions: first, leM ^e period when it contained great independent states ; secondly, the i-jllfk period of its subjection to one after another of the great military i&gt;; Powers—Persian, Greek, Parthian, Sassanian, Arab, and Turk— which in succession have held the Near or Middle East in dominion. . jjg The first period dates from before the dawn of history till 539 b c ., when imlkl Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon ; the second has continued from that date to the present time. The early history of Mesopotamia is that of Babylonia and Assyria. The strength of Assyria lay in the plains east of the middle Tigris in the neighbourhood of the Great and Lesser Zab the root of Babylonian civilization was firmly planted in Irak—at first in its lower half, but from about 2100 b.c . onwards permanently in its upper portion, where for the past 4,000 years the cities of Babylon, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Baghdad (all lying within a circle of 30 miles radius at the point where the Tigris and Euphrates approach each other) have, one after another, been the capital cities of Mesopo tamia and the chief commercial centres and emporia of the Near East. Babylonia was incomparably the more important ; Assyria was only an episode in comparison. Babylonia had a widespread civilizing influence on the peoples of Nearer Asia. All the surround ing nations looked up to and were attracted towards the seat of this ancient civilization, whether they were under its supremacy or whether they imposed their own rule on it. Indeed during one period cuneiform writing and the Babylonian language were the medium of diplomatic and commercial international correspon dence throughout the countries from Egypt to Asia Minor, from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Babylonian religion, Baby- lypostii The Kingdoms of Ancient Mesopotamia70 HISTOEY Ionian weights, measures, and currency, astronomy, divisions of time, and banking system profoundly influenced the successors of Babylonia in culture and civilization. In Babylonia a vast alluvial plain with a soil of^ astonishing fertility and an abundant supply of water for irrigation favoured the creation of a wealthy and populous agricultural and industrial community. Here too, where main routes of international com munication crossed each other, commerce flourished, and the Baby lonian kingdom showed many of the qualities of a commercial state, for example, a preference for the employment of diplomacy rather than of force. Assyria on the other hand was and ever remained a purely military community, relying on violence, and subject to a sudden and total collapse when violence failed. The very earliest records show lower Irak in the^ possession of a non-Semitic people already in a high state of civilization. They seem to have come from central Asia originally. In their final home between the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the sea they must have spent thousands of years before they had reached the point of having introduced an elaborate system of canalization ; industries had made much progress; they had invented cuneiform writing and had evolved an elaborate religious system and ritual; they lived in cities around which the population was grouped in a series of small city-states independent of and warring with each other ; complicated laws and customs, which had been reduced to writing, regulated social and commercial relations and transactions. It is impossible to be sure of the origin of this comparatively advanced civilization ; only one thing is certain, that before 3000 b.c. it was in full vigour and flourishing. Sumer, as this country was called, and its inhabitants, the Sumerians, were defended from aggression to the south by the lagoons and marshes then existing at the head of the Persian Gulf, and to the east by the mountains of the Persian plateau, which formed an effective barrier to the irruption of less civilized races. These moreover had first to penetrate the territory of Elam, an ancient and highly civilized power which acted as a buffer on the eastern flank of Sumer; and, although Elam was rarely friendly to the Sumerians, it saved them from worse neighbours. On its other sides Sumer was indeed open to attack; but it must always have been in contact with the peoples of Arabia—the Semites. The Arabian Desert has been described as one of the earth's great reservoirs of men. At various dates, in prehistoric times, its over flow must have found its way directly into the Euphrates valley, while other movements, advancing via Palestine and Syria, acquired some civilization and agricultural habits on the road, and moved3'? HISTORY 71 slowly eastwards to the upper Euphrates and Tigris; it was probably by this latter route that Assyria received her early Semitic population while that of upper Irak was reinforced. The coming of the Semites into Babylonian life seems to include both the chief forms of contact between the nations of antiquity, viz. the bodily migration of a whole people and commercial traffic, the latter probably preceding and leading to the former. What happened before 3000 b.c . it is as yet impossible to say. But that there had been a Semitic immigration there can be no doubt. For the Semites are found firmly settled and forming the bulk of the population in upper Irak, at first in small city-states after the fashion of the Sumerians, but, as a consequence of reinforce ment from their own stock, coalescing into a firmly knit, homo geneous nation. Their receptive genius enabled them, in a short time, it seems, to assimilate the Sumerian civilization and religious system to a remarkable extent, and without losing their national speech, or their national characteristics of superior energy, driving power, and capability to organize, develop, and consolidate. First, they proceeded rapidly to annex the Sumerian south, and then were able with united forces to cross the Tigris and occupy Elam. Other campaigns covered the JezTreh up to the foot-hills in the north and opened up trade-routes towards Syria, the Mediterranean, and Asia Minor. Both in Sumer and for a time in Elam the Semites succeeded in imposing their own language on their subjects—in Elam only for official purposes (much as Persian is still used in Afghanistan), but in Sumer to the exclusion of the native tongue, except for ritual and religious uses. For these special purposes it survived as a purely literary language till the time of the Greeks. Another great wave of Semitic immigration appears to have occurred circa 2300 b.c . The immediate consequence of this is seen in the rise of a dynasty of great vigour and prestige in Akkad (northern Irak). It definitely conquers and incorporates the south, assumes the title of Kings of Akkad and Sumer, borne ever after by the kings of Babylonia, and makes Babylon—hitherto a city of insignificant rank—into the capital of a compact and united kingdom, and a pre-eminent political, commercial, and industrial centre, which was to endure for 2,000 years. Hammurabi 2100 b.c .), king and founder of the united Babylonian state, is famous as the ruler who issued the earliest legal code known to history. In his reign can be first discerned the working of the Babylonian state policy, a stable line of action which steadily aimed at the expansion of commerce, the opening of trade-routes, and the spread of civiliza tion. Under him and his successor the Babylonian empire embraced72 HISTORY the whole of Mesopotamia, Assyria being held as a garrisoned province, and stretched across the upper Euphrates into Syria; a firm grip was laid on the one side upon the trade-routes from the Euphrates through the Syrian Desert to the west, and on the other side through Elam eastward. The policy thus initiated by Ham murabi and his dynasty was never dropped by the Babylonian state, but was reasserted whenever an opportunity offered. The Semitic incursions which thus led to the founding of Babylon also gave rise to Assyria, at first, as stated above, a province of Babylonia, but afterwards to become the rival and enemy of the southern kingdom. Here the Semites appear to have amalgamated with an indigenous population more barbarous than the Sumerians, and to this pre-Semitic element may perhaps be traced the strain of brutal ferocity which appears in the Assyrian character. The brilliant first epoch of Babylonia was eclipsed by the invasion of the Kassites, who overthrew the Semitic dynasty and reigned in its stead at Babylon, becoming rapidly absorbed in the local popu lation. They appear to have been of Iranian extraction and to have descended on Mesopotamia from the Persian plateau through Elam. And since it is at this period that the then civilized world became acquainted with the domesticated horse, there is some reason to believe that the Kassites brought the horse with them and owed their success to this most important factor in war, which must have worked a revolution in the methods of the fighting of the time. The Kassites ruled over a diminished Babylonian empire for 400 or 500 years, and then their dynasty fell before a further incursion of Semites, which appears to have entered Mesopotamia, after 1500 e.g., from the north in the shape of the Aramaic horde, followed at a later period in the south by the Chaldaeans. In the anarchy which followed the collapse of the Kassites came the first chance of Assyria, which, between circa 1280 b.c . and 1100 b.c., established an empire that reached the Mediterranean seaboard, penetrated into Asia Minor, and treated on equal terms with the kings of Egypt. At this time the Assyrians attempted to secure their conquests by sending out colonies of the peasantry which composed the bulk of their armies. Meanwhile Babylonia was assimilating its new rulers. Now again the advanced civilization of the country and its dense popu lation were influences too strong for foreign conquerors to with stand. Shortly after 1100 b.c . the Assyrian empire declined; the causes are obscure, but were probably chiefly connected with pressure from Asia Minor and the highlands to the north-east. In proportion Babylonia rose for a time, resisting its Assyrian and Elamite neigh-HISTORY 73 bours, and, though later it fell under the suzerainty first of Elam and then of Nineveh, it apparently never lost its identity as a cor porate unit. In the second half of the eighth century the Assyrian monarchy recovered its strength and built up a new empire more powerful and more closely organized than the old. The Assyrian kings fought and conquered in Media, Armenia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Babylonia. But these victorious wars gradually drained the strength of Assyria, which was further sapped by the Scythian inva sion ; and the second empire fell at the end of the seventh century b.c. before a political combination of Media and Babylonia. In its second phase the Assyrian empire had lost what would otherwise have proved a firm base for its continued existence—its peasants. They had been used up in the series of constant wars and colonizations; those who remained in their original home had become serfs, and the state had been driven to the employment of mercenary armies whose pay had to be defrayed by a policy of spoliation and oppression of conquered territories. In consequence the fall of the empire was complete and irretrievable. Its territory was divided between the Medes and Babylonians, the former taking the north and the latter the south. Now came the final epoch of Babylonian independence, the period in which Nebuchadnezzar was the most notable figure. Apparently some sort of balance of power was arranged, the Medes being given an open door to Asia Minor, and Babylonia reserving for herself Syria with Palestine and the trade-routes to the west from Mesopotamia, and also the right of dealing with Egypt. The arrangement worked for 70 years, and was then overthrown by the sudden rise of Cyrus the Persian. After conquering Media, Cyrus appeared at the gates of Babylon in 539 B.C., and the native dynasty vanished. Henceforward the history of Babylonia is that of a province. She had fulfilled her mission. Mainly owing to Babylonian influence and Babylonian policy, the seeds of civiliza tion had been spread far and wide throughout the Near East. Mesopotamia undue Foreign Rule The establishment of the Persian Empire was on the whole not unfavourable to the economic interests of Mesopotamia, for the imperial government was tolerant of local institutions and customs, and promoted commerce and industry in so far as it kept the peace in the countries under its rule. The ancient system of irrigation74 HISTOKY was preserved. Babylonia was the richest province of the empire and had the reputation of being the richest country in the world. The city of Babylon remained the great market and industrial centre which she had been in the days of the Babylonian kingdom. The spring residence of the Persian court was at Susa (Shush, near Dizful). In 331 b.c . Alexander the Great invaded Mesopotamia, defeated the Persian king between Mosul and Erbil, and entered Babylon and Susa. Alexander undertook irrigation and drainage works on the Euphrates, and seems to have contemplated the development of the Tigris as a commercial highway. He is said to have planned the improvement of the waterway of the middle Tigris, and he may have entertained the plan, afterwards carried out by Seleucus, of trans ferring to the banks of the Tigris the capital of Babylonia. He actually founded a port at the head of the Persian Gulf in the neigh bourhood of Mohammareh. When after Alexander's death at Babylon in 323 b.c . his empire broke up, one of his marshals, Seleucus, acquired Mesopotamia together with Iran, Syria, and part of Asia Minor. It was Seleucus who shifted the centre of trade and industry in Babylonia from the Euphrates to the Tigris. No doubt he was moved to this step by the superior advantages of the Tigris as a channel for water-borne traffic. But inasmuch as it was always a natural necessity that there should be a centre in northern Babylonia round which its dense population could gather, and at which merchants, passing along the trade-routes that here crossed each other from the four corners of the earth, could meet and do business, he selected a site only 40 miles north of Babylon and 18 miles south of the modern Baghdad, on the right or western bank of the Tigris. Seleucia grew rapidly in size and importance. It was equally suitable with Babylon for the pur poses of inter-continental land trude and better adapted for water-borne traffic; moreover it was one of the capitals of the Seleucid kingdom. Without any sensible pressure on the part of royal authority, the population of Babylon gradually migrated to Seleucia; and after the lapse of two or three generations little more than mounds and ruins were left to mark the site of the older city. Seleucia remained a centre of Hellenism long after Babylonia had reverted to Asiatic rule. From 312 b.c . Mesopotamia was for 175 years a possession of the house of Seleucus, and then again passed under an Asiatic govern ment. The Parthian dynasty, which, originating in Khorassan, had gradually extended its power westwards over the Iranian plateau at the expense of the Seleucid empire, made repeated attempts to seize Mesopotamia, and succeeded at last, when the Seleucids hadHISTOEY. 75. exhausted their strength in their struggles with the Romans. Follow ing the usual custom of Orientals, the new rulers chose a capital city of their own making, and founded Ctesiphon. on the left or eastern bank of the Tigris, exactly opposite to Seleucia, which, however, in no way suffered thereby. Arab historians state, 700 years later, that at the time of the Moslem conquest of Mesopotamia both cities were great and flourishing. In a.d . 226 the Parthians gave way to the Persian dynasty of the Sassanids, who thereafter held Mesopotamia until the Moslem invasion. The monarchy of the Parthians and Sassanids was constantly at war with the Roman Empire, which was established in Syria. At first the middle Euphrates was the boundarj 7 between the two Powers. There was a long struggle for the protectorate of Armenia, which ended in a compromise favourable to Rome. Trajan ( a.d . 115-117) tried to settle the Eastern question by the conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia down to the Persian Gulf, but his gains could not be maintained, and under his successor Hadrian the original boundaries were restored. In the middle of the second century a. d . a successful war gave Rome the western part of the upper Jezlreh (region of Urfeh and Harran), and at the end of the same century the eastern portion of the Jezlreh north of the Sinjar hills also came under her control. A number of Roman fortresses were established in the country, the principal of which was Nisibis. The upper Jezlreh was thenceforward the scene of numerous campaigns, but, though successful Persian invasions were not uncommon and the frontier shifted backwards and forwards, the country was generally under Roman rule. In northern Jezlreh there are still to be seen memorials of the Roman Empire in city-walls (Urfeh, Diarbekr) and remains of bridges, forts, &amp;c. Under Parthian and Sassanid in the south and Roman rule in the north, Mesopotamia long continued to flourish. Like Cyrus and his successors, the Parthian and Sassanid kings spent then- winters at Ctesiphon. The great arch of Ctesiphon belongs to the Sassanid period. Babylonia was still extraordinarily rich; under Sassanid government the irrigation-system of Irak was probably brought to the highest pitch of development which it has ever attained. The Jezlreh contained some considerable cities and, besides fertile irrigated areas, much pastoral wealth. But towards the end of the Sassanid age civil and foreign war and weak government were beginning to affect the prosperity of the country. During this period Christianity spread both in the Roman and in the Persian provinces of Mesopotamia, and, after it had been adopted as the State religion of the Roman Empire (fourth century), it became76 HISTOEY the dominant faith in the northern part of the country, (See further on the origins of the present Christian sects in Mesopotamia pp. 128-30.) Moreover the influence of Hellenism, after its first introduction by Alexander, did not entirely die out in Mesopotamia, but survived through the Parthian and Sassanian epochs and indirectly inspired the best achievements of the older populations which became nomi nally Arab under Arab rule and speech. The wealth of Mesopotamia, its pasture-lands, and its rich cultiva tion had long attracted the nomads of Arabia, and from time to time, when the civilized governments of the country were weak, Arab tribes had established themselves within its borders. In the Sassanid age there were Bedawis in the steppes of the Jezlreh, many of them subject to the emirate of Hatra (El-Hadhr). At Hira, on the western edge of Irak near Nejef, Arab immigrants who had given up their nomadic habits were ruled by a dynasty of Arab princes. Thus the way was to some extent prepared for the most notable of all the Arab invasions of Mesopotamia. In a.d . 628 Mohammed sent to the Koman Emperor and to the Persian king a summons to acknowledge God and His Prophet. But for the remainder of his life Mohammed was occupied with conquering Arabia for the Faith. His death in a.d . 632 was the signal for fresh trouble in Arabia, but this was rapidly suppressed by the Caliph Abu Bekr, and by the end of a. d . 633 Islam went forth to attack at once the Roman Empire and the kingdom of the Sassanids. These great Powers had recently been waging war on each other for about a quarter of a century, and both were suffering from the effects of this conflict as well as from internal troubles. In the Persian Empire the murder of Khosrou (Chosroes II) in a. d . 628 had been followed by a struggle among the nobles over the succession to the throne, and this had not yet been settled when a Moslem army under Khalid-ibn-Walid, the ' Sword of Cod ', invaded the lands along the lower Euphrates. The Moslems were at first successful, and then suffered a check, due to the withdrawal of Khalid with a part of the Arab forces to assist in the conquest of Syria. But the fall of Damascus in a.d . 635 set free reinforcements for Mesopotamia, and in a .r&gt;. 636 the Moslems utterly defeated the Persians in a most stubbornly contested battle at Kadisiyeh, on the fringe of the desert, 15 miles west of Kufeh. This battle practically settled the fate of the Persian monarchy. That it was a complete rout is clear from the leisurely manner in which the Arabs proceeded to settle and colonize Mesopotamia. Ctesiphon, with Seleucia, fell in a.d . 637, and in the same year Kufeh and Basra were founded as Arab strong holds, the latter superseding the Sassanian port of Ubuka for the(itq) HISTORY 77 trade with the Persian Gulf and India. There followed a migration en masse of Arabs with their families and belongings, who descended upon the country and made it their own. Many of the resident population perished by the sword; many fled; others fell victims to the floods and to plague and famine, which raged at this period. But there is little doubt that a large proportion embraced Islam and adopted Arabic speech, and it is to them that we must trace in great measure the administration and cultural achievements on which rests the fame of the Abbasid rulers of Baghdad. The Arab conquest was eventually carried up to the Taurus range. In northern Mesopotamia a numerous Christian population continued to exist under Moslem rulers. About the time of the Mohammedan conquest Babylonia was visited with a catastrophe which in the southern and south eastern part of the country had permanently disastrous results. Towards the end of the fifth century a . n. a heavy flood in the Tigris burst its banks and overflowed the lands to the south and south-west, probably impeding the current of the Euphrates. The Sassanids, however, repaired the damage, and most of the flooded lands were brought back into cultivation. But about the year a.d . 629 the Euphrates and the Tigris came down in such floods as had never before been seen. Both rivers burst their banks in innumerable places, and finally laid all the surrounding country under water. The Sassanid king, Parvez, made desperate efforts to reclaim the country, sparing neither money nor men's lives ; ' indeed', the Arab historian reports, ' he crucified in one day forty canal- workers at a certain breach and yet was unable to master the flood'. During the succeeding years of anarchy, when the Moslem armies began to overrun Mesopotamia, and the Sassanian monarchy perished, the dykes, such as still existed, naturally remained uncared for, 'and breaches came in all the embankments, for none gave heed, and the landowners were powerless to repair the dykes, so that the swamps every way lengthened and widened'. It seems to have been at this time that the main stream of the lower Tigris was diverted to the channel now known as the Shatt el-Hai, where it remained until the sixteenth century. The new Arab rulers of the country were hardly qualified by their previous training or their temperament to take the charge of complicated works of irrigation. These nomads were not without the ability to appreciate civilized influences, but the fame and success of the empire which they founded depended mainly upon the work and genius of their Greek and Persian ministers and administrative staffs. But it must not be supposed that the circumstances of Mesopotamia were even then, or for cen-78 HISTORY turies to come, anything like what they are at the present day. Northern Irak remained well irrigated; some districts in upper Mesopotamia were still rich and productive; the government of the Abbasid Caliphs, till it lost its vigour and power, attended care fully to what had been saved from the wreck of the older world; and it required six centuries of subsequent Mongol and Turkish misrule and apathy to bring the country to its present miserable condition. Mesopotamia was but a province of the Arabian empire from the battle of Kadisiyeh, a. d . 636, till a.d . 762. The Caliphs of the Omayyad dynasty had their capital at Damascus. But it was during this period that northern Irak became the holy land of the Shiahs. The converts to Islam in Mesopotamia and Persia brought something of older religions and philosophies to their new faith, and the character of their Mohammedanism showed itself in the rapid growth among them of sects and strange mysticisms. In the dis sensions that arose in Islam over the Caliphate this neo-Moslem spirit devoted itself to the claims of 'Ali and his*family. It was too undisciplined to give 'Ali or his sons the victory over the Omayyads, but it gathered strength from its defeats. At Kufeh 'Ali was mur dered, at Kerbela Husein his son was slain, and on their deaths the religious fervour of the Shiahs has been nourished. (See also on this subject pp. 125-7.) The Abbasid caliph Mansur, after the destruction of the Omayyad dynasty, which ruled from Damascus, perceived that a new capital was needed for the new dynasty. The decay of the Arab tribal system, on which the military power of the Omayyads depended, and the support given to the Abbasids by the neo-Moslems of the former Sassanian territories, decided him to move the seat of govern ment to Mesopotamia. The causes which led to the selection of the sites of Babylon, and subsequently of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, which are mentioned above, were still in force, and accordingly Mansur, in a. d . 762, founded Baghdad on the Tigris, 20 miles above Ctesiphon. For the same reasons that led to the rapid growth and permanence of its predecessors, Baghdad soon rose to eminence. It was second only to Constantinople in size during the Middle Ages, and was unrivalled for splendour throughout western Asia. Wars and sieges, the temporary removal of the seat of government to Samarra ( a. d . 836- 892), and even the almost entire destruction of the city by the Mongols in a.d . 1268, have never permanently affected the supre macy of Baghdad in Mesopotamia. The country shared in the general prosperity of the golden age of Islam, which culminated during the reign of the Caliph HarunHISTOEY 79 er-Rashld, a. d . 786-809. After Harun's death the decay of the Abbasids began. The Caliphs fell under the control of their mer cenary army ; and even the Turkish soldiers who ruled in their name lost all authority outside Irak. The rest of the empire was in dis solution, and in the tenth century the whole of northern Mesopotamia became an Arab kingdom under the Hamdanids. Order was for a time partially restored by the advent of the Seljuk Turks, whose chief, Toghrul Bey, was invested in a.d . 1005 by the then caliph, with what practically amounted to the temporal sove reignty of Iran, Mesopotamia, and so much of Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine as was in the power of Islam. The Caliphs were mere honorary figure-heads living in a mysterious seclusion—the fountains of honour and title like the later emperors of Delhi, and sacrosanct as being the successors of the Prophet, but practically without any ! tifii temporal power. By the end of the eleventh century the Seljuk power had broken up into a number of quarrelling principalities, and the Crusaders were able not only to establish themselves in Syria, but to cross the m Euphrates and found at Edessa (Urfeh) a Christian State which lasted ism for about fifty years. ill In the first half of the twelfth century a Turkish kingdom was built up in northern Mesopotamia by Zangi, the son of a lieutenant of a former Seljuk governor of Aleppo. Zangi destroyed the County ami of Edessa in 1144, and extended his influence over northern Syria. His son, Nur ed-Dln, won Damascus and Egypt, and finally Nur ed- litriliil * Din's governor in Egypt, Salah ed-Dln (Saladin, born at Tekrit), succeeded to his master's power, combining under his rule Egypt, Syria, and northern Mesopotamia. But after Salah ed-Dln's death (1193) his monarchy dissolved into a number of independent states. In the general political confusion there was some revival of the tem- fllii poral power of the Abbasid Caliphate; but about the middle of the jsP thirteenth century the Abbasids were extinguished, and Mesopotamia jiplm was ruined, by the cataclysm of the Mongol invasions. In February, 1258, Hulaku Khan took Baghdad; the city was jjjjli sacked, and the last Caliph of the Abbasids was taken prisoner and jjjd killed. The wealth and treasures of ages were plundered ; priceless literary and artistic remains were destroyed. An irreparable blow was delivered at the heart of Moslem civilization. This is the end of i r | Arab rule in Mesopotamia. It was accompanied by the ruin of the L whole system of irrigation, and the country which had known pros perity for thousands of years became a waste of unfruitful waters in arid plains of dust and sand. ' The work of three hundred genera- p tions of men was destroyed in a single year '; and the desolation of80 HISTORY the Mongols has endured to this day. The destruction ot the sources of wealth in Mesopotamia had a profound effect on the Middle East; it was as if the keystone had been taken out of the ancient structure. Though Baghdad continued to exist, shorn of its splendour, Meso potamia practically disappears from history for the next 300 years. Instead of being the focus of the Oriental world it became a blank. It followed the fortunes of whatever dynasty or tribe rose to be a brief power in its neighbourhood. For a short time it was included in the dominions of Timur. Eventually the Turks laid hands on it in a.d . 1534, and till 1914, with one short interval, it has been at least nominally a Turkish possession. In 1603 Shah Abbas of Persia conquered Mesopotamia, but it was retaken by the Turks in 1638. At this time the fortunes of Baghdad had reached their lowest ebb, and the city contained only 14,000 inhabitants. Turkish sovereignty could not be vigorously enforced. The Kurds of the northern and eastern hills were practically independent, and in the plains the nomad Arabs, taking advantage of the absence of strong government, the decay of irrigation, and the decline of popu lation, had been gradually encroaching on the settled areas, and could not be brought under control by the Turks. The most impor tant movement of nomad Arabs in this period was the Shammar invasion. About the middle of the seventeenth century the Sham- mar migrated from central Arabia to the Syrian Desert, pushing before them various smaller tribes into Mesopotamia. Following on their occupation of the tracts west of the Euphrates, the Anazeh came up behind them from Arabia. After a protracted struggle the Shammar were compelled to move on, and, crossing the Euphrates, gradually came to dominate the whole of the Jezlreh, exclusive of the hills, driving out or subduing the Tai, the Jebur, the Baqqarah, the Weldeh, and others. Similar incursions took place from time to time in Irak. Till the recent consolidation of Turkish authority, which gradually asserted itself during the last century, the pashas maintained a semblance of power by playing off one Bedawi tribe against another, Anazeh against Shammar, Muntefiq against Beni Lam, &amp;c. In consequence the condition of the nomads, except in the vicinity of the cities and settled tracts along the rivers, varied from semi-independence to complete freedom from all control. The remaining centres of order and civil life, to a great extent isolated by the unsettled areas, were beyond the effective control of the Sultan's Government. When in 1732 Nadir Shah laid siege to Baghdad, he was driven off by a Turkish pasha who was for all practical purposes an independent ruler. From the end of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth centuryHISTORY 81 Mosul was governed by a local aristocracy. In Basra a local noble, Afrasiab, succeeded in founding a virtually independent state, which collapsed in 1779 ; at this time the population of Basra had shrunk to a few thousands. From 1817 to 1832 Baud Pasha, a Georgian, held office at Baghdad, and under his energetic and intelli gent administration the city and province began to recover, in spite of a terrible epidemic of plague during 1830-1, which is said to have carried oft 50,000 persons in Baghdad alone. Heavy floods in the Tigris simultaneously swept the country. Famine followed these disasters, and in 1837 there are said to have been only 40,000 inhabitants in Baghdad. On the conclusion of the Crimean War, the Porte found itself in possession of a large army and plenty of money, and determined to assert itself in Mesopotamia. Omar Pasha, then governor of Aleppo, marched down the valley of the Euphrates at the head of a considerable number of troops, and took possession of Ja'abarand Beir ez-Zor. Beir had previously been held by Fellahin Arabs, who had enjoyed a semi- independence under Anazeh protection. It now became the head of a Turkish province, under the vali of Aleppo. This policy of enforcing Turkish authority was carried on by Midhat Pasha, who was governor of Baghdad between 1869 and 1872, and made great efforts to develop Mesopotamia. His administration was at least vigorous, and, if he sometimes failed rather disastrously, he was certainly honest in intention. He was an enthusiastic reformer on Western lines, but failed in many cases to foresee the cost or consequences of his innovations. He built forts to protect the Euphrates navigation and the route to Aleppo, and he initiated a service of Ottoman steamers on the Tigris. He attempted, without success, to drain Lake Aqarquf NW. of Baghdad. To protect Baghdad from the flood-water of the Euphrates he closed the Saqlawiyeh canal, but as he provided no compensating escape he thus originated the diversion of the main volume of the river down the Hindiyeh canal and the disastrous drying of the Hilla arm (see p. 26). He is said to have tried to get the treasures accumulated at Nejef devoted to public improvements. His reforms in land-tenure are described on pp. 193-4. He adopted the policy of encouraging nomad Arabs to settle down as cultivators, and he endeavoured, with indifferent success, to get Turkish suzerainty recognized by Arab chiefs whose autonomy had hitherto been practi cally unquestioned, such as the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. Buring the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid (1876-1909) the f Turkish administration on the whole effected some progress, in spite ft of its mistakes and crimes. The Kurds were brought under some flw mes. i p82 HISTORY degree of control, partly by force, but more by the congenial employ ment which Abdul Hamid found for them as irregular cavalry in the Sultan's service used for the purpose of repressing such elements in the population of northern Mesopotamia and Armenia as were suspected of disloyalty. The were in fact privileged to behave as they chose; and their excesses, though mainly directed against Christians, did not spare Moslems : yet economic development was not altogether checked by their depreda tions. The efforts of the Government to control the Arabs were still spasmodic and marked by an impolitic mixture of laxity and oppression : yet, in spite of outbreaks of disorder, Turkish power was growing, and cultivation and trade were developing ^ more or less slowly in the river-valleys. A considerable proportion of the nomad Kurds and Arabs were compelled or induced to take to a more settled way of life. The action of the Sultan in converting into his private property {saniyeh) 30 per cent, of the best cultivated lands in the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad, and a considerable amount in the northern provinces, although accompanied by much injustice, was probably of some economic benefit to the country. The Sultan s estates were comparatively well managed, and law and order were enforced at least within their limits. The native population generally was living in expectation of greatly increased prosperity which was to be the result of the projected Baghdad Railway. / Nevertheless the methods of the Sultan's Government—its corrup tion, fraud, and violence—aroused considerable discontent throughout Mesopotamia. The Turkish Revolution of 1908 was welcomed by the bulk of the population, as most sections of it hoped to profit by the change. These hopes were generally disappointed by the deter mination of the Young Turks to carry through a centralizing and levelling policy, and by their methods, which were not more scrupulous than those of the old regime. The Government achieved some successes: Ibrahim Pasha, the head of the Milli Kurd confederacy, was put out of the way; Nazim Pasha obtained the submission of the Northern Shammar and appointed a paramount chief in the Turkish interest; and strong measures were taken against the depredations of the Hamawand Kurds near Kirkuk. But there was much disorder in Irak, and the unsuccessful Turkish wars with Italy (1911) and the Balkan States (1912) made matters worse. The permanent ill feeling of the Arabs against the Turks was now taking shape in a Pan-Arab movement, and in this way the Arab disaffection in Mesopotamia was brought into connexion with the anti-Turkish movement in Arabia. Opposition to the Govern ment grew even in Basra and Baghdad. Ajaimi Ibn Sa'adun, para-HISTORY 88 ijjii mount chief of the Muntefiq, who has opposed vis in the present war, was on bad terms with Ibn Rash id, the comparatively pro-Turkish Emir of Jebel Sham mar, and was reported to be planning an attack on Basra; the waterways between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf were rendered insecure by the prevalent disorder; and a general rising of the southern Mesopotamian Arabs was feared, but did not come to a head. Meanwhile lawlessness was increasing in Kurdis- biiiji where a number of chiefs were entering into relations with Russia. The whole situation was still uncertain when the Euro- ,, j ? pean war broke out, Arabistan was formerly the Persian province of Khuzistan. In jtsd the first half of the nineteenth century the southern part of the country eastwards from Mohammareh and the Kartm was dominated jpi ^7 the Ka'ab, an Arab tribe whose head-quarters were at Fellahlyeh, J while Hawlzeh was under a hereditary vali. Mohammareh, which tMi belonged to the Muhaisin Arabs, was for some years in dispute between the Turkish and Persian Governments, until by the Treaty of Erzerum (1847) it was assigned to Persia. After the Persian War of 1856-1857, when a British force captured Mohammareh, the , power of the Ka'ab was broken by the Persian Government. The * ' sheikhs of the Muhaisin then became dominant in southern Arabistan, where they were formally recognized by Persia as governors of the country. They became practically independent (see pp. 150-1). In I5t ' northern Arabistan a Persian governor continued to reside, either at • | Shushtar or at Dizful, but in fact he had generally very little f* authority. In the politics of northern Arabistan the chief factors : were the influence of the Bakhtiyari chiefs and of the Sheikh of Mohammareh, the Sagwand Lurs and the Arab tribes of the country, ::i -® and the mujtahids (religious leaders) of Dizful and Shushtar. The ^ Behbehan district, which had been a sub-governorship under Fars, tiwf fell under the control of the Bakhtiyari chiefs (see further p. 152). j 1 ' In 1907 Sheikh Khaz'al of Mohammareh and the Bakhtiyari khans »ip® concluded a treaty of alliance, of which the general purport was that the parties were to act together in controlling Arabistan. There ere®' remains, however, a good deal of rivalry between them. P An attempt was made in 1847 to create a fixed boundary between ilT# Turkey and Persia in place of the vague and shifting borderland {e i# which had long been a source of trouble. By the Treaty of Erzerum the I' 5 (1847), certain concessions having been made on each side, the jjWf* definition of the frontier was assigned to a Turco-Persian Com- fiioEfl' mission. The Commission failed to arrive at a settlement, and in ie W1851 Great Britain and Russia intervened. A belt of country, 20-40 miles broad, was taken as indicating the general lie of the frontier, p 284 HISTORY and was surveyed. But there were many areas of disputed land on which no final settlement was reached. Provisional agreements kept matters in suspense without too great inconvenience, until the Young Turks began encroachments in Arabistan and tmyards Urmia. Then Great Britain and Russia again intervened. The boundary between Turkey and the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammareh was fixed by an agreement of July 29, 1913. A Protocol, signed at Constantinople on Nov. 4 (17), 1913, by Great Britain Russia Turkey, and Persia, laid down the course to be followed by the frontier from the Gulf to Ararat, leaving the settlement of details at many points to a Delimitation Commission. This Commission, which comprised representatives of all four Powers, completed its work m the first eight months of 1914. The frontier was surveyed the details of its course were settled, and it was marked out with boundary- Pll The interests of Great Britain in Mesopotamia had grown up before the revival of the authority of the central Turkifeli Govern ment. A British Resident was first appointed to Baghdad at the end of the eighteenth century. These interests were partly com mercial, partly political. Great Britain established and maintained order and security in the Persian Gulf, which she cleared of slavers and pirates, policed, and charted, and in protecting her commerce she established a paramount political influence along the shores of the Gulf and up to Baghdad. She was also concerned to guard the interests of the large numbers of Shiah Indians who made the pilgrimage to Kerbela and Nejef, and the British Indian Government was trustee for a number of endowments founded by Indians at these places. Moreover British predominance in the Gulf and in Irak was considered necessary for the security of India against attack from without. In the early part of the nineteenth century, before the cutting of the Suez Canal, the possibility of establishing a regular commercial and post route between India and England across Mesopotamia was much discussed, and the famous expedition ot Chesney (1835-7) was a reconnaissance made with this scheme in view. A railway was projected which was to connect the Mediter ranean at Alexandretta with the Persian Gulf along the line ot the Euphrates. The opening of the Suez Canal and the acquisition by the British Government of a controlling interest in it caused the Euphrates Valley Railway scheme to be dropped. But British com merce continued to develop without serious competition on the bhatt el 'Arab and lower Tigris, 1 British protection was afforded to the 1 An arrangement of 1846 gave British merchant vessels the right to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers. The Turkish Government ignored this Convention andHISTORY 85 practically independent Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammareh, and British prestige in Irak remained very great. There was, however, much latent jealousy on the Turkish side, and this was stirred to activity about the beginning of the present century, as the result of German influence, by this time predominant in Turkey. In the original German plan of a railway to Baghdad a line by Angora, Sivas, Diarbekr, Mosul, and Kirkuk had been chosen. This route was given up owing to Bussian opposition, which was grounded on strategical considerations. When the project took definite shape in the Convention of 1903 a line was chosen more remote from the sphere of Bussian interests, namely, by Konia, Baghcheh, Jerablus, Nisibin, Mosul, and Samarra. Further, there was to be an extension of the line from Baghdad to some point on the Persian Gulf, and north of Baghdad there were to be a number of branches, of which the most important within our area was that from Sa'diyeh to Khanikin (see further pp. 264-5). The proposal to carry the Baghdad Bailway to the Persian Gulf was an obvious menace not only to Great Britain's commercial interests in Irak and the Gulf coasts but also to her political position in southern Asia. Moreover Russia still viewed with dislike the prospect of a line to Baghdad as threatening her interests in Persia. About the same time the Turks were beginning to show signs of wishing to increase their power in north-eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf at the expense of Great Britain. The Germans thought of making Koweit the terminus of their railway, and when the Sheikh of Koweit refused to sell them land the Turks tried to seize the town, but were warned off by the British. Turkish intrigues became more persistent after the Revolution of 1908 and the rise to power of the German-controlled and chauvinistic Com mittee of Union and Progress. An unsuccessful attempt was made to induce the Sheikh of Koweit to renounce his connexion with the British Government, and an encroachment was made on the terri tory of our other ally in this region, the Sheikh of Mohammareh, Arabistan had recently become exceedingly important to Great Britain from a military as well as from a commercial point of view, owing to the discovery of the oil-wells in the Shushtar region ; these are now worked by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in which the British Government has acquired a predominant interest. The Turkish intrigues failed, and the troubles of the Turkish ad- closed the Mesopotamian waterways above Basra to foreign mercantile shipping with the exception of a limited number of vessels owned by the British 4 Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company' (Messrs. Lynch). (See further on the commercial navigation of the Tigris p, 200.)86 HISTORY ministration led to a partial cessation of these attacks. Meanwhile determined efforts were being made by the Germans to compete with British trade in Irak and Arabistan (see pp 204-5), and the question of the Baghdad Eailway seemed about to be settled on terms favour able to Germany. In 1911 Russian opposition to the railway, and in particular to the Sa'diyeh—Khanikin branch, had been withdrawn, and it was arranged that this branch should be linked on to the pro jected Russian railway system in northern Persia ; and shortly before the present war the British Government was ready to permit the exten sion of the Baghdad Railway as far as Basra, in return for what was in effect to be British control of the Shatt el-'Arab, of steam-navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates between Basra and Baghdad, and of any extension of the railway that might be made from Basra to the Persian Gulf.CHAPTER VII INHABITANTS Numbers and distribution of population—Movement of population—Ethno graphy (Arabs—Luis—Kurds—Other groups)—Principal languages—Education. Numbers and Distribution op Population There are no exact statistics of the population of this area; in fact the estimates that were made before the war were only more or less rough guesses, and sometimes they conflict with each other in a remarkable way. As a rule the recorded estimates seem to be too high, and some of the exaggerations appear to be very gross. The following estimates may perhaps be worth giving, but may be very wide of the truth : Irak (Basra and Baghdad vilayets) . About a million souls. 1 Arabistan, Behbehan, and the Persian^ Highlands (including the Kuhgalu and A few hundred thousand Bakhtiyari countries, Pusht-i-Kuh, and Isouls, probably not more the western half of the province of Kirmanshah) Upper Mesopotamia, with southern Turkish Kurdistan, central Kurdistan south of the Tigris—Lake Van water shed, and the country north of Diarbekr up to the line of the eastern Taurus Total . . . . than half a million. About a million souls, or perhaps somewhat less. Perhaps between two and two and a half millions. ^ Between 1900 and 1908 the population of Irak was estimated at various figures between a million and a half and three millions. Accoiding to the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf (1908) it probably amounted to '1.500,000 souls or rather more including a very small proportion of Bedawis. The total number of the settled and semi-nomadic population was given by the same authority as 1,480,000. This estimate had been ' compiled, district by district, from informa tion collected for the .. . Gazetteer But a census taken at Basra in July 1916 showed that the estimate given in88 INHABITANTS This total includes a number of tribes which either are wholly nomadic, or belong to that class of ' semi -nomads' in which at least a large part of each tribe moves every summer to a considerable distance from its winter quarters. If all the nomads and the semi- nomads of the class described, to whatever race they may belong, are counted in, and those who are within or just on the limits of this area for a part of the year only are included, they may amount to between 15 and 20 per cent, of the above total. But their numbers are really quite uncertain, and are even more difficult to estimate than those of the settled population. ... In the course of the present war the population of certain districts in upper Mesopotamia has been very considerably reduced; for example, in those parts of the Diarbekr vilayet where Armenians have been massacred or deported, and in central Kurdistan where the Christian Hakkiari tribes and the Armenians south of Lake Van have been massacred, or have been driven from their homes to die in great numbers in the course of their flight. On the other hand large numbers of deported Armenians have been brought down to the upper Mesopotamian plain and the middle valley of the Euphrates; but the rate of mortality among these deportees, who arrived in 1915, appears to have been very high. Irak In Irak over 90 per cent, of the population is grouped along the rivers and canals. The rural population is on the whole densest in the following areas ; (a) along the Shatt el-Arab ; {h) along and near the Euphrates, especially between Museyib and Diwaniyeh on the Hilla branch or Kufeh on the Hindiyeh branch, and again in the Nasirlyeh—Suq esh-Shuyukh area; (c) on and near the Shatt el-Hai; {d) to the north and north-east of Baghdad, along the Tigris and in the country watered by the Khalis canal between the Tigris and the Diyaleh, and in the Baqubeh district; (e) in the country round Amara on the lower Tigris. Of these areas the Shatt el-Arab district contains the most closely settled population ; here the villages and hamlets are set close along the river-banks on narrow strips ij-2 miles wide among the date- groves irrigated by the tidal rise of the river. The line of the Euphrates is far more densely inhabited than the the Gazetteer for Basra and its environs was considerably exaggerated. It was discovered that the population of Basra, Ashar, and some outlying villages 1 could be at the outside 35,000 whereas the Gazetteer put it at 58,000. If the case of Basra is typical, the population of the whole of Irak may be only about 900,000.COP! INHABITANTS 89 line of the Tigris ; perhaps the population on or within 20 miles of the Euphrates between Museyib and Kurna is about six times as great as the population on or near the Tigris between Ctesiphon and Kurna. This greater concentration on the Euphrates has existed for thousands ot years. It remains to-day, and is likely to remain, because the slope of the ground-levels 1 and the work of past ages in distributing the water of the Euphrates make that river more applic able than the Tigris to the purpose of irrigation. The number of pure nomads whose movements are confined to Irak is very small, but the desert south and west of the Euphrates is visited by tribes from the Nejd and elsewhere at certain seasons of the year, and in Irak itself a proportion of the inhabitants still keep to a ' semi-nomadic' life (see p. 97). Towns of Irak.- —The position of the chief town of Irak, (140,000) 2 , is eminently favourable to the existence of a great city. For Baghdad stands where the Euphrates and Tigris approach within 40 miles of each other, and where the country between the rivers begins to be easily traversable below the arid part of the Jezlreh that lies to north. On Baghdad converge naturally, in conformity with physical features, all the lines of communication which enter Irak from the north-west, the north, and the north-east: the Euphrates valley line leading from northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia ; the line of the middle Tigris from Mosul; the other line from Mosul that runs under the southern Kurdish hills by Erbil, Kirkuk, and Kufri; the line from Kirmanshah by Qasr-i-Shlrln, leading from Persia through a natural gate in the mountains. To the south there is easy communication with the thickly populated Kerbela—Hilla region, with its agricultural districts and its pilgrim- centres ; and lastly there is the waterway of the Tigris leading from the Persian Gult and navigable to Baghdad by river-steamers. For its food-supplies Baghdad can draw easily both on the Euphrates to the south and on the Baqubeh—Khalis canal area to the north. Basra(33,000) is the port at the southern gate of Mesopotamia ; ocean-going steamers can ascend to it by the Shatt el-'Arab. and Nejef (60,000 and 30,000) are pilgrim-centres which attract Shiahs from all parts of the Mohammedan world (chiefly from Persia and India); Nejef is also the starting-point of a pilgrim-route to Mecca, 1 Almost the whole country between the rivers in Irak, down to the line Knt el-Amara—Nasiriyeh, is commanded by the flood-levels of the Euphrates, and can be irrigated by its water. 2 The figures given for the population of towns must be taken as guesses, giving perhaps some rough indication of their size ; they may be often wide of the truth by some thousands. h I90 INHABITANTS and both towns, situated on the edge of the Arabian Desert, are markets for the Bedawin. Kufeh (5,000) and Samarra (8,000) are places of pilgrimage for Shiahs, but much less important than Kerbela and Nejef. Of the other towns some are markets along the Euphrates, Tigris, or Shatt el-Hai, the centres of fertile districts, or owing their importance to their positions at the junction or diverging-point of waterways, e.g. Kurna (5,000), Suq esh-Shuyukh (10,000), Nasirlyeh (10,000), Samaweh (500 houses), Diwaniyeh (500 houses), Hilla (30,000), Tawarlj or Hindiyeh (4,000), Museyib (6,000), Amara (10,000), Kut el-Amara (4,000), Kut el-Hai (4,000), Shatrat el- Muntefiq (500 houses). Others are strung along the great Baghdad— Kirmanshah road, as Baqubeh (6,000), which is the centre of a very fertile district, Qizil Kibat (2,000), Khanikin (5,000). Others are in oases, as Beledruz (3,000), Mandali (6.000), which is supported partly by the oil-wells in its neighbourhood, and Bedrah (3,000). Zobeir (1,500), on the edge of the desert near Basra, is a starting-point of desert-routes and a centre of intercourse with the Bedawis. Some of these towns have small local industries—boat-building, weaving, &amp;c. A very ancient bitumen industry, as well as boat-building and the passage of caravans, supports Hit (1,600). Arabistan Here the population is gathered mainly on the left bank of the lower Shatt el-'Arab, in the very fertile Shushtar—Dizful area, and in other fertile watered areas, such as those of Fellahlyeh, Kamuz, and Behbehan. The proportion of nomads and semi-nomads to the whole population is higher than that of Irak. Some of the Arab tribes move back wards and forwards over the Irak-Arabistan border, or have sections in both territories. Towns of Arabistan. — Mohammareh (12^000) derives its political supremacy in southern Arabistan from its position at the junction of the Karun with the Shatt el-'Arab. Its population has increased considerably since the opening up of the Shushtar—Ahwaz oil-field and the establishment of the Lynch trade-route across the Bakhtiyari country to Isfahan. Dizful (15,000) and ShusMar (10,000) lie in plains of great fertility. There are ways across the mountains north of Dizful which are easier than any other routes into Persia between the Gulf and the Qasr-i-Shlrln depression. Both towns have decayed owing to anarchy in south-eastern Luristan and the consequent closing of trade-routes, and also owing to the general insecurity in northern Arabistan.INHABITANTS 91 Both (and especially Dizful) would be revived with a good government in the country, with the construction of the projected railway from the Shatt el- Arab to Dizful, and with the further exploitation of the neighbouring oil-fields. AJiwaZ'Naziri ( t ,000) has importance as being at the head of the lower and easier section of the navigable part of the Karun, which is divided from the upper section by the Ahwaz rapids. Ahwaz is the starting-point of the Lynch route over the Bakhtiyari mountains to Isfahan. 'The Persian Highlands adj In the Kuhgalu country, in the Bakhtiyari country, in the south eastern corner of Luristan, and in the Pusht-i-Kuh there are nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes moving to and fro, according to the season, between the higher and the lower pastures. In the western part of the Kirmanshah province there is a certain settled population, of late reduced in prosperity and numbers by insecurity here and in the rest of Persia. Kirmanshah town (40,000) is outside our area, but may be mentioned here as the eastern end of the main highway from Mesopotamia into Persia, whence important routes radiate to north, north-east, and south-east. Along the Baghdad road a number of small towns or large villages occur on Persian territory. The most important of these is Qasr-i-SJnrm (5,000), near the Turkish frontier. Upper M y Bural Population. —A scanty rural population is spread out over (tl tlie hill-country, varying in density according to the soil, the water- supply, the extent to which the inhabitants have suffered from their g neighbours or the Government, &amp;c. The fertile upland plain of ^ Diarbekr and the comparatively secure plateau of the Tur Abdin j have maintained a fair number of settled inhabitants, but the former , area —lowland of Diarbekr—did not before the war contain ' ■ nearly as large a population as it might be made to support, and the 1 ' formerly considerable Armenian element was much reduced, if not i almo . st annihilated, in 1915. As regards central Kurdistan, estimates 1 published in 1891 represent the eastern part of the country (along :i the Zab valley and towards the Persian frontier) as more thickly populated than the western, but the figures for the eastern districts (amounting to about 250,000 for the part of the sanjaq of Hakkiari within the limits of our area) were probably too high. It is true.92 INHABITANTS however, that in the neighbourhood of the Zab valley the defensi- bility of the country had made it the home of a Christian popula tion, which was larger than might have been expected from the barren and rugged nature of much of this region. This Christian population was for the most part either massacred or expelled in 1915. In southern Kurdistan the population is very small in pro portion to the area .of the country. Its settled element is mainly to be found scattered in the lower valleys north of Erbil, or, south of Erbil, grouped here and there among the last foot-hills on the edge of the Tigris plains, or, farther east, occupying valleys and basins between the lower hills and the higher ranges. In the plains the sparse population is distributed chiefly in the foliowing areas : (a) in parts of the middle Euphrates valley (as from Hit to Anah, from Abul Kemal to Deir ez-Zor, and from Abu Hureireh northwards); for the past forty or fifty years the valley has been gradually recovering a settled population, after it had been nearly emptied by anarchy; (&amp;) between the rivers on the north western and northern sides of the plain, e. g. in the feajur district, the country south of Urfeh, the Nisibin district and the edge of the plain from Nisibin to JezIret-ibn-'Omar; moreover a population which is at least partly agricultural has been growing up, in spite of insecurity, along the Belikh and the Khabur ; (c) between the rivers, in the Jebel Sinjar and the country at the foot of that range to south and east; {d)east of the Tigris, in the Mosul—Erbil plains ; also at various points under the Kurdish foot-hills from Altun Kopru down to Kufri. Both in the plains and the hill-country of upper Mesopotamia nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes pass to and fro on their yearly rounds. Towns. —The towns of upper Mesopotamia are markets and admini strative centres, and support some small trades and industries. There is a group of towns lying on that caravan-route from Aleppo to Mosul which has avoided the open plains and the southern end of the Q a raj eh Dagh country as too insecure and too waterless, and has made a detour north by Diarbekr. These towns are Birijik (7,000), Urfeh (80,000), Diarbekr (40,000), Mardln (15,000), Nisibin (5,000), Jezlret- ibn-'Omar (5,000), and Zakho (3,000). Of these is by far the most important, for here the route passing west and east is met by the main routes from the Black Sea, eastern Anatolia, and Armenia. Diarbekr also has the advantage of its fertile neighbourhood, which, among other things, provides raw material for its silk-weaving industry. It is to be observed that the Baghdad Railway now strikes acrossr —'n ■ ® ; ) , INHABITANTS 93 the plain of the north-western Jezlreh, which the old main route avoided, and thus leaves Birijik, Urfeh, and Diarbekr a good way to north. Mosul (70,000) not only lies on the trade-route between Diarbekr and Baghdad, but is the chief collecting and distributing centre for the commerce with central Kurdistan. Here come the raw goods exported from that hill-country, and its manufactured imports that are sent from Aleppo or Baghdad—from the Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf. Moreover Mosul has had some decreasing caravan-trade with north-western Persia through Eowanduz. Its proximity to large quarries enables it to supply the southern plains with building-stone, and its tanneries are supplied with the hides of Kurdistan, but its weaving industry, once famous, has sunk into insignificance, and it depends chiefly on the transit of commerce attracted to it by its position as a route-centre. Of the group of towns north, east, and south-east of Mosul only the more important are mentioned here. Bitlis (30,000) in its gorge occupies one of the main gates of Mesopotamia towards the Armenian plateau, and to it come routes from Diarbekr and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar ; these meet at Sairt (10,000) in the Bohtan valley, a place which.has some small local industries and an export of salt. Van (30,000), in a plain of great fertility, lies outside the limits of our area, but has been a market for its north-eastern fringe and the administrative centre of all the eastern part of centra] Kurdistan. Owing to disorders and the insufficiency of communication, the trade of Van, in the years before the war, was not flourishing. QaTah (5,000) lies on the Van—Urmia caravan-route, and its position as a meeting-point of local tracks made it an important military post from which the tribes were watched. Amadiyeh (3,000), on the southern edge of central Kurdistan, is a trading centre for the Hakkiari country. In southern Kurdistan Bowanduz (5,000), as mentioned above, lies on a caravan-route from Mosul to Tabriz, but the roads are bad, and the trade is declining. Suleimaniyeh (12,000) is the chief market of southern Kurdistan, and has a commercial connexion with Baghdad in the first place and with Mosul in the second. Its plain is naturally fertile, but the place has decayed owing to disorders within and around it. On the edge of the hills Erbil (6,000), Altun Kopru (3,000), KirJcuJc (20,000), and Kufri (or Salahiyeh : 4,000) lie along the Mosul —Baghdad road, and from these routes branch eastwards to the hill- towns. Tuz Khurmatli (1,200) and Kufri have some small trade in oil, and the former also in salt, the latter in coal. On the Tigris Tekrit (3,000) lives mainly by the downstream raft traffic from Mosul to Baghdad.94 INHABITANTS To turn westwards again, there are a few small towns in the country between Diarbekr and the eastern Taurus, e. g. Farqln (about 800 houses) on the road from Diarbekr to Bitlis, and Lijjeh about 1,000 houses) on the road from Diarbekr to Erzerum. South east of Diarbekr, Midiat (3,000) is the local centre of the Tur Abdin. In the northern Jezlreh Beled Sinjar (2,500) and Tel A'far (6,000) lie in cultivable lands south and east of the Sinjar hills, and Beled Sinjar is the post from which the Yezidis of these hills are watched. The Baghdad Kailway has yet to make its towns in the north-western JezTreh. Lastly there are the towns in the middle Euphrates valley below Birijik : Deir ez-Zor (12,000) and Anah (5,000). They live partly by their position on the valley road from Aleppo to Baghdad and on the waterway of the Euphrates (the Anah men are the best boatmen on this part of the river). They are also centres of contact with the Bedawis. Deir ez-Zor holds a very important position. Not only is it near the mouth of the Khabur, but the Syrian Desert to west of it and the Jezlreh to east, being less arid here than farther south, are traversed by caravan routes, from Deir to Damascus on the one hand, and from Deir to Mosul on the other. Movement of Population Increase and As there are no statistics of births, deaths, migrations, &amp;c., nothing definite can be said about any change in the total number of the population. On the whole it seems to have been growing slowly in the years preceding the present war, but the increase in* some districts had been at least partly compensated by a decrease (generally due to disorder) in others. (For effect of the war on population of upper Mesopotamia and central Kurdistan see p. 88). There was a tendency among the nomadic population to settle down and take to cultivation. The Turkish Government tried to encourage this tendency, but also in some degree checked it by failing to create confidence or to give adequate protection against disorder. The inhabitants of the country in the years before the war had lively, though somewhat vague, expectations of benefits to be derived from the Baghdad Eailway, and the completion of the line would probably lead rather rapidly to a considerable shifting in the dis tribution of the population. On the relation of the labour-supply in Mesopotamia to the prospects of agriculture see p. 171.INHABITANTS 95 Emigration and There has been no appreciable amount of emigration to other countries from Irak. From northern Mesopotamia there has been a certain emigration of Christians, usually to America. From tiiG vilayet of Diarbekr it was leported in 1908 that at least forty families of Armenians were leaving every year, in spite of the difficulties put in the way of the movement by the authorities. This tendency to emigration had its main cause in insecurity; it had apparently become appreciable since the massacres of 1895. There has also been a movement of individuals who left their homes to seek their fortunes, intending to return with their profits. Armenians and Syrian Christians emigrated in this way. There has been little immigration in recent times—the yearly flow of pilgrims to the Shiah shrines in Irak not being considered under this head. Persians, to the number perhaps of 50.000 to 60,000 (including Persianized Baluchis), are settled in Irak for trade or religion (see p. 116); but there is no evidence as to the rate at which this settlement has taken place. There were a few Indian traders in Irak (at Basra and Baghdad), but they were not much in evidence. Persians from the Grulf have lately come to seek work in the Basra district, but it is doubtful whether many of these, or of the Lurs who come from the hills to work in Irak or Arabistan, are to be counted as permanent settlers. Small colonies of Indian Shiahs were to be found at the holy cities of Kerbela, Nejef, and Kazimain. Pathans and Afghans used to come to Baghdad to seek their fortunes as doorkeepers, or in other employments for which their masterful character suited them. Nearly, if not quite, all the Indians in Irak before the present war were Mohammedans. Ethnography It is often impossible to disentangle racial elements in Meso potamia, especially those of the non-Arab population, and in the following lists are included divisions of the population which are more clearly marked off by religious and other peculiarities than by their race. It may be remarked here again that the tendency of most authorities is to exaggerate the numbers of the population and of its racial and other groups.96 INHABITANTS arabs Numbers an The Arabs form the great majority of the population in the plains, where other races are hardly found except (a) in some of the towns, and {b) on the northern and eastern fringes of the plain country. The Arabs of the Jezlreh, Irak, and Arabistan may number in all about a million and a half. The Mesopotamian Arabs form the north-easterly part of the main body of their race. In various ways they are in close con nexion with their oyrn people to south and west. On the north the limit of the predominantly Arab country is, roughly, on a line across the Jezlreh from Jerablus to between JezIret-ibn-'Omar and Mosul. Here, along the fringes of the plain, under the spurs of the Qarajeh Dagh and the southern face of the Tur Abdin, the Arabs are in contact with Kurds and Syrian Christians. Along this borderland runs the Baghdad Eailway. West of Mosul there is a large group of Yezidis islanded among Arabs in the Jebel Sinjar. On the east the Arabs are practically not found beyond the Tigris above Mosul, but south of Mosul (which is a predominantly Arab city) they share with the Kurds the plains east of the Tigris and north of the Jebel Hamrln. In the neighbourhood of the Diyaleh the Jebel Hamrln marks roughly the frontier between Arab and Kurd, and farther south the boundary between Arabs and Lurs runs along the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh hills to the western border of Arabistan. In Arabistan the Arabs hold the greater part of the plains. On the northern edges of these plains, in the districts of Dizful, Shushtar, and Eamuz, they are in contact with Lurs of various kinds (Sagwand, Bakhtiyari, and Bahmai Kuhgalu). East of the lower Karun, about the Jerrahi and the Hindlyan, they have Lurs (Kuhgalu, &amp;c.) or Perso-Arab cross-breeds (Behbehanis) for their neighbours. The inhabitants of the towns under the hills are of mixed blood. Modes of Life: As regards their mode of life, the Arabs of Mesopotamia may be divided conveniently into nomads, semi-nomads, and a wholly settled element, rural or urban. But it is to be remembered that in fact the classes of nomads, semi-nomads, and settled cultivators are not divided by hard and fast lines; the first shades off into the second, the second into the third.INHABITANTS 97 (a) Nomads. The nomad Arabs are to be found mostly on the borders of the western deserts and in upper Mesopotamia ; there are only a few in Irak, fewer, proportionately, it seems, than in Arabistan. They are pastoral tent-dwellers, and breeders especially of camels, sheep, and horses. For much of what they eat, drink, and wear they are dependent on the urban markets. They are tribally organized. Each tribal unit has certain pasture-grounds, which it visits or leaves, according to the season of the year, its movements being dictated by the need of pasture and water. Some of the tribes which at certain times appear on the western borders of Irak or upper Mesopotamia, are at others far away in the Syrian Desert or in the Nejd. Much of desert policy and warfare hangs on these tribal rights over certain areas. A stronger group will sometimes oust a weaker from a part or the whole of the latter's territory, and this may setup a wide-spreading movement. Some of the nomad sheikhs own, or have some more or less recognized claims over, cultivated lands in oases or near rivers; these lands are worked for them by negroes or fellahin. (b) Semi-nomads. —The tendency of the nomads to settle down and turn to agriculture has had the result that there are a number of Arab tribes living in various intermediate states between pure nomadism and the condition of wholly settled cultivators. The process of settlement is liable—especially at first—to be easily sus pended or broken off; a tribe may do a little cultivation for some years, and then, owing to a quarrel with its neighbours or the Government, or a failure of its crops, may go off elsewhere. A community may cultivate first one piece of ground and then another more or less in the same neighbourhood, shifting its dwellings as it moves its fields. The semi-nomads are generally mainly dependent on their live-stock—sheep, cattle, horses, sometimes camels. In the spring, when there is abundant pasture in the open desert or steppe, the greater or a considerable part of a semi-nomadic tribe will range over the plains with its flocks and herds. Some semi-nomads live in tents all the year round, even where they raise their crops; others have villages of mud or reed huts near their fields. (c) Settled Arabs. —Most of the Arabs who can be regarded as wholly settled cultivators still keep more or less to their tribal organization, but in some of the most highly cultivated areas Arabs belonging by blood to several different tribes will be found living together in the same village, and here the tribal bond will be weak or absent. This is the case on the right bank of the Shatt el-'Arab, except in so far as the Sheikh of Mohammareh has kept his hold on his tribesmen who have settled on this side of the river. mes. i Cr98 INHABITANTS General Characteristics. — The Arab is generally intelligent, quick, and impressionable ; often he has a certain subtlety of mind whic \ is capable of a high state of culture. But he is slovenly and uncreative in practical matters, and is lacking in the power of co operation and of sustained labour in the face of difficulties. The Arab ideal of conduct is humane, and includes courtesy, generosity, and hospitality, and may express itself finely in action if it is not stifled by the desires of the moment. The Arab is often grasping and unscrupulous in his pursuit of gain. He has a natural bent tor intrigue, is much under the sway of personal ambitions and jealousies, and is very much of a time-server. In any conflict he may be expected to drop a cause 'which he thinks the loser, but is not likely to change sides till it seems safe to him to do so. His word is generally easily broken unless given under certain forms or in certain circumstances which make it a point of honour with him to keep it. For the wilder tribesman blackmail and thievery are normal and proper ways of earning a living. The town-rabbles, often of very mixed blood, are generally in bad repute. ^ The Arab tribesman is used to continual but fairly harmless warfare, made up of raids, loose skirmishes, and running fights. He frequently commits acts of treachery and he is generally ready to rob or blackmail a weaker neighbour ; but in inter-tribal warfare he does not show himself bloodthirsty, and surrenders are readily accepted. In warfare with regular troops he usually confines himself to guerilla methods, the harassing of retreats, or sudden but not very determined attacks. The Arab is said to be an inferior horse- master and a poor shot. A really strong wave of religious fanaticism, which is always to be counted on as a possibility in a Mohammedan country, might make the tribal levies far more dangerous; but in modern times the Mesopotamian Arabs have had the reputation of being comparatively free from fanatical religious feeling. ^ As regards his economic capacity, the Arab has a certain aptitude for trade, but in Mesopotamia he is outrivalled in this respect by other races—Jews and Armenians especially. The Bedawi has a contempt for manual labour as degrading. As a cultivator the settled or semi-nomad Arab is usually rather slovenly and sketchy, and inclined to take the line of least resistance; but the conditions under which he at present works in Mesopotamia are against the development of his capacity in this respect. The quality of his agricultural work has been observed to improve with an improvement in his circumstances; and it seems quite likely that under a good government which gave him security, water (justly distributed), and instruction, he would be capable of using his opportunitieskti INHABITANTS 99 nnt'L iab ? urer ? a ™ intelligent and give good resnlts when ol: , f CM ^ k '''I'y,' 11 managed.

(See Tribal System Outside the larger towns and a few rural areas the tribal system Prevails among the Arab population, and tribal custom and the authority of tribal sheikhs have been much more potent forces in IdmSitlon Mesopotamian A ra b S than Ottoman law and Mesopotamia has been repeatedly invaded by nomads from the P Gm nsula, and from these immigrants are descended the Arabs who now inhabit the country. At the present time the nomad Aiabs of Mesopotamia and the Syrian Desert 'are regarded by the peninsula Bedawis as forming one great social block with them selves , and though the Mesopotamian tribes which have taken to a more or less settled agricultural life have thereby lost caste in the eyes of the Bedawis, they too have retained the memory of their peninsular origins and to some extent the sentiment of their peninsular traditions. The successive waves of Arab invasion have in many instances broken up the old tribes or tribal groups, into widely separated fractions. One part of a tribe, or confederation of tribes, may have remained m Arabia while another is to be found east of the Euphrates. _ Difterent sections of a tribe may now be far apart from each other in Mesopotamia, or some sections may be dwelling on the Tigris while others are on the eastern borders of Syria. Where such separation has happened, the sentiment of common kinshio imjK)rtance ^ Sti11 ^ Cei ' tain circumstance s of practical The largest unit in the tribal world is the group or confederation ot tribes. Some of these groups are of very considerable size (e. p -. those of the Muntefiq m southern Irak and of the Anazeh in the u TT - k ^ g J r . ea . t n er groups ma y contain sub-groups, and the tribes again are divided into sub-tribes and clans. Corre sponding to these divisions are sheikhs of various degrees. The composition of the tribal group, its divisions and subdivisions, the number of its paramount sheikhs and the extent of their authority, are continually liable to fluctuation. The power of the a 2100 INHABITANTS sheikhs over their tribesmen will depend on a multitude of cir cumstances, such as their capacity, their wealth, their relations with other members of their family, the amount of prestige they have inherited from their predecessors, or, again, the tribe's relations with its neighbours or with the Government. Tribal groups may split into two or more divisions, a small tribe may be absorbed into a larger unit, or a section of a tribe may break away and become independent. In general, tribal government depends on the free consent ot the tribesmen, and that consent has to be obtained in councils where the Arab love of diplomacy and argument produces interminable and tortuous discussions. Disputes between tribesmen are settled (if they are settled peace ably at all) by the sheikhs and their councils, in accordance with tribal custom, or by the arbitration ot holy men. The sanction ot these decisions lies in this, that it they are not accepted the parties are involved in the inconveniences of reprisals or the blood-feud. But honour may demand that the blood-feud be taken up, and tribal vendettas have been a terrible scourge of the country. Tribal The following are some of the more important Arab tribal groups in Mesopotamia: (a) InIralc (South Muntefiq and Other Groups on Muntefiq tribes are to be found in the country north of Nasirlyeh along the southern part of the Shatt el-Hai, and in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates from Duraji down to Suq esh-Shuyukh, and also (appar ently) below Suq esh-Shuyukh. The Muntefiq are 'a large and loose confederation of tribes of different origin, all of whom acknowledge to a less or greater degree the overlordship of the Sa'dun clanThe Sa'dun are Sunnis, the tribes under their overlordship Shiahs. Some sections of the Muntefiq are nomadic, but most of them are settled or semi-nomadic. They are well provided with modern rifles. The authority of the Sa'dun has been weakened of late owing to dissen sions between its members, and the confederation has lost much of its former extent and cohesion. Before the war the Beni Malik on the Tigris between Kurna and Ezra's Tomb, and several groups on the Euphrates below Suq esh-Shuyukh seem to have broken or loosened their connexion with the Muntefiq. The Arabs of the Euphrates marshes were then completely out of hand ; neither the Turkish Government, nor, in many instances, their own sheikhs, could control them. In the Suq esh-Shuyukh and Hammar districtsINHABITANTS 101 are the Mujarrah and Beni Khdiqan confederations. The Iluniuid are a confederation north of Nasirlyeh and on the left (E.) bank of the lower part of the Shatt el-Hai. ' The occupy the opposite bank. Beni Hudiaim. Between Duraji anrf Samaweli. This large group of settled tribes has lately lost much of its cohesion. Khazail. On the Euphrates from Samaweh up to Kufeh. A large tribe or tribal group ? described as 'strong and warlike but not naturally pugnacious'; generally hostile to the Anazeh and Southern Shammar. Some sections are nomadic, others semi-nomadic or settled, cultivating rice, wheat, and barley. The sections in the desert are horsemen and well mounted ; those in the Euphrates marshes depend on their mashhufs (canoes), like other marsh Arabs. Shiahs. Beni Hasan. On the Euphrates in the kazas of Nejef, Shamlyeh, and Hindiyeh. Partly settled, partly semi-nomadic. Shiahs. Al Bit Fatlah. In the kaza of Hindiyeh, especially between Tawairrj and Hilla, and near Tel Nimrud, and in the Shamiyeh kaza about Ja'arah. Cultivators. Jandhiyin. On the left bank of the Euphrates above Museyib. Cultivation. Mostly Sunnis. Zobeid. A large group between the Euphrates in the Museyib— Hilla region and the Tigris above Bogheileh. Among the Zobeid tribes are the Beni Ajll, the Al Bu Sultan, the Mu'amrah, the Khafajah, the Juheish, and the Jebur. Semi-nomads, cultivating wheat, barley, rice, and maize, and owning sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. Shiahs, with some exceptions (e. g. the Beni Ajll). The Zobeid are apparently generally hostile to the Northern Shammar and friendly to the Dilaim. Al Bu JKoJiammed, In the marshes along the Tigris between Azair and Amara ; sections of them are found scattered elsewhere in lower Irak. A socially inferior people of non-Arab origin. Eice-growers and breeders of buffaloes. Well armed with rifles. Shiahs, with some exceptions. ^ Beni Lam. On the left bank of the Tigris between Amara and Ivut el-Amara; also in Arabistan. Semi-nomadic, rice-growers, cattle-breeders ; their horses and camels are reckoned the best in Mesopotamia. Good shots, especially from the saddle. Shiahs, with some exceptions. ^ Beni JRabiaJi, Near Kut el-Amara and on the northern part of the Shatt el-Hai. A turbulent tribe. Its fighting strength is estimated at about 8,000 rifles. Important sections of the Beni Kabiah are the Amarah (on the right bank of the Tigris below Bogheileh ; about 900102 INHABITANTS fighting men), the Maiyeh (between the Tigris and the right bank of the Shatt el-Hai; about 800 fighting men), the Serai (between the Tigris and the left bank of the Shatt el-Hai; about 500 fighting men), the Maqasis (on the right bank of the Tigris above Sheikh Sa'adl, and the Kawara (on the left bank of the Tigris). The Beni Eabiah cultivate wheat, barley, and maize; and own sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. They are Shiahs, with the exception of the Kawam. Shammar Toqah. A group of tribes mainly on the left bank of the Tigris from below Baghdad to opposite Bogheileh, and in the country between the Tigris and the Persian hills. (It appears that some Shammar Toqah tribes are to be found, at least occasionally, between the Euphrates and Tigris, and west of the Euphrates about Kerbela.) Semi-nomads ; cultivate wheat, barley, and maize. Shiahs. Part of the Northern Shammar (see below, p. 104) may come down in winter as far south as the country between Hilla and Azlzlyeh. Three important tribal groups of the Arabian Desert range at times on the borders of Irak south of the latitude of Baghdad. These are the Dhafir, the Southern Shammar, and the Amarat branch of the Anazeh. The Dhafir (reckoned at 2,500 tents) move in summer from the Balin towards the Euphrates about Nasirlyeh and Samaweh. They are active raiders and fighters and have been hostile to Ibn Rashid of Ha'il. The (Ibn Kashid's people) are reckoned at something under 4,000 tents. The Southern Shammar range almost as far north as Nejef. On the see below under Anazeh. [b) In Ara Jfuhaisin, The Sheikh of Mohammareh, the ruler of southern Arabistan, is of this tribe. The Muhaisin number perhaps about 12,000 souls. They are found along the lower Karun between Mohammareh and Wais, and on Turkish territory along the Shatt el-Arab between Basra and Mohammareh. Settled cultivators; Shiahs. Ka'ab. Mainly in the Fellahlyeh district ; also in 'Abbadan Island. They form the largest tribal group in Arabistan, number- ing perhaps about 50,000 souls, and up to some fifty years ago they dominated the country. They are now subject to the Sheikh of Mohammareh. Settled cultivators; Shiahs. The majority of the tribesmen are armed with rifles. JBawlyeh. On the left bank of the Ab -i-Gargar and lower Karun, and east of the Karun towards the Jerrahi. Mostly nomadic. It appears that in 1908 between a halt and a third of the fighting menINHABITANTS 103 (who were perhaps some 2,000 in all) were armed with rifles. Subject to the Sheikh of Mohammareh. In the Hawlzeh district, between the Karun and the Tigris, are the large groups of the Beni Tur (20,000 souls ?) and the Beni Sdleh (15,0u0 souls?), a branch of the Beni Tamlm (10,000 souls?), and some sections of the Beni Lam. These tribes are mainly semi- nomadic, grow rice, wheat, and barley, and own live-stock consisting, in different proportions, of cattle, buff,Joes, sheep, donkeys, horses, and camels. (The Beni Turuf are said to own no sheep.) They are partly marsh-dwellers and partly range over the dry steppes. The majority of the Beni Tamlm are Sunnis, the other tribes are Shiahs. Before the war a large number of their fighting men were armed with rifles. The Beni Turuf are specially noted as turbulent robbers. Anafijeh. Mainly on the Dlz within 20 miles of its mouth, on the right bank of the Karun, and on the Ab-i-Shatait. Mostly semi-nomadic. Fighting-men estimated in 1908 at 1,140, the majority armed with rifles. The Anafijeh pay tribute to the Sheikh of Mohammareh. In northern Arabistan the chief Arab tribes are: Kathir (generally pronounced Oh Along the Dlz above the Anafijeh and between the Dlz and the Korkeh. They are mostly nomads. Their fighting men are all armed with rifles. Beit Saad. Along the Dlz, where they are interspersed with the Kathir, and in the Miyanab. They are mostly hut-dwellers. Their fighting men are armed with rifles, but few of them are mounted. They are under the paramount chieftainship of the sheikhs of the Kathir, who are believed to be of Beit Sa'ad extraction. Beni Lam. See p. 101. (c) North o tDilaim (about 3,000 tents). On both sides of the Euphrates, from Feilujeh almost to Anah. Their paramount sheikh, Ali Suleiman, has a house and palm-gardens at Kamadiyeh. The Dilaim are Bedawis, own large numbers of sheep, but do not breed camels. They are generally friendly with the Amarat Anazeh and hostile to the Northern Shammar and to Beni Hasan and other Shiah tribes of Irak. Sunnis. 1/ Anas eh. This people forms a great group of Bedawi tribes, | probably the largest in the Arab world. They occupy ' the triangle | of the Syrian Desert, which has its base on the Nefud, about lat. 30°104 INHABITANTS and its apex near Aleppo, about lat. 36°In the eighteenth century the Anazeh pushed the northern branch of the Shammar out of the Syrian Desert across the Euphrates, and have remained at feud with that people. It is to be noticed that the Anazeh are not a con federation ; their large sections are in general friendly to each other, but have their occasional bickerings, and the whole Anazeh people has not been known in recent times to act together. The Anazeh are great breeders of horses and camels. They are Sunnis. Two great Anazeh tribes range about the middle Euphrates valley —the Amarat (about 3,000 tents), and the (about 3,500 tents). Of these the Amarat are to be found in the Syrian Desert between Kerbela and Hit, and also at times move across the Euphrates into the Jezlreh. Their paramount chief, Ibn Hadhdhal, owns palm- gardens at Ghazazeh near Kerbela, at Baghdadlyeh above Hit, and elsewhere on the Euphrates. The Fed e an (about 3,500 tents) range from Deir almost up to Aleppo, and along the lower Khabur. Other Anazeh tribes are the Sba' in the central Syrian Desert, and the Kuweilah and Wuld 'Ali on the western side of the desert from Homs and Hama in the north to the Wadi Sirhan on the south. The Ruweilah are Nuri Ibn Sha'lan's people, and they and their allies, the Wuld 'Ali and some smaller tribes, number about 7,000 tents. The paramount sheikhs of the four largest Anazeh tribes, Ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat, Ibn Muheid of the Eed'an, Ibn Shalan of the Euweilah, and Ibn Smeir of the Wuld 'Ali, could each, it is believed, put into the field from 1,500 to 2,000 men armed and mounted on camels with a small proportion of horses. The Sba' sheikhs could muster about 1,000 men. Northern Shammar (variously estimated, ' probably a total of 2,000 tents is not far from the true figure ; but they have been put as high as 10,000 tents'). In the Jezlreh plains between the Tigris and Euphrates, and occasionally east of the Tigris about the Lesser Zab. In summer their sections are to be found on the Khabur and in the plains south of Nisibin and about El-Hadhr. In winter they may come down into the 'Aqarquf region or farther south into northern Irak. The Shammar are the dominant group in the Jezlreh ; they are at feud with the Anazeh and generally on bad terms with the Kurds to north and east. Their ruling house is that of Jerban. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the paramount chieftainship was shared by two brothers of this house, Paris on the Khabur and near Nisibin, and Ferhan whose head-quarters were at El-Hadhr on the Wadi Tartar. In 1911, . when the Shammar were rounded up at El-Hadhr by Hasan Riza Bey, Asi, the eldest of Ferhan's sixteenINHABITANTS 105 sons, was appointed by the Government paramount sheikh of all the Northern Shammar. Asi, who is now an old man, frequents the Mosul region, while his cousins, the sons of Abdul Kerim, Abdul Mehsin, and Mohammed, range on the Khabur. The sons of Faris are said to be of not much account. Some of Ferhan's sons own land on the Tigris. Among the half-settled Arab tribes of upper Mesopotamia are the following: ■leghatfeh (2,000 tents). Euphrates valley, between Anah and 'Irsi. Al Bu Kemal (2,000 tents). Euphrates valley, from 'Irsi to Meyyadln. Al Bu Mueyt (1,500 houses) and A Bu (1,200 houses). Euphrates valley round Meyyadln. JBaqqarah (1,200 tents). In summer near Deir ez-Zor and Qal'at en-Nejm; in winter about the Jebel 'Abdul despised tribe of shweya ('herdsmen'), paying tribute to the Shammar, Afadlch (2,000 tents). In the region of Belikh. A tribe paying tribute to the Shammar. 'Assaf (800-800 tents). In the region of the Belikh. A tribe paying tribute to the Shammar. Khamis (2,000 tents). In summer at Membij NE. of Aleppo, in winter at 'Ain el-Beidha west of Sheddadi. Qeys (2,500 families, 400 nomad). Near the Belikh, and in the Euphrates valley as far north as Jerablus. A fairly powerful tribe. Weldeh (1,000 tents). In summer at Qal'at Jabir about 25 miles below Meskeneh, in winter at Jubb Shair east of Seruj. Tarfawi (2,000 tents). East of the Belikh. Hadldiyin (1,500 tents). In summer between Nisibin and Urfeh, in winter in the Jebel 'Abdul Aziz. Pay tribute to the Shammar. 'Achvan (900 tents). Near Veiranshehr. Fay tribute to Shammar. Jebur. A numerous group. On the middle Tigris between Mosul and Samarra. There are also JebQr in the neighbourhood of the Khabur and Kas el-'Ain. They pay tribute to the Shammar. Tai (2,000 fighting men). Partly near Nisibin, partly east of the Tigris about the Zabs. A powerful tribe. 'Uhcid. East of the Tigris between Tekrit and Kufri. In the country between Baghdad and Samarra and between Baghdad and Kufri or Khanikin there are a number of minor Arab tribes, partly settled, partly nomadic. Of these may be mentioned the Khazraj round Beled and Sumeikeh, the in the neighbour hood of the Jebel Hamrln west of Kufri, and the Tamfm, who are found both east and west of the Tigris. There is a section of106 INHABITANTS the Beni Tamlm on and east of the Baghdad—Khanikin road between Shahroban and Qizil Eibat; their neighbours here are the Beni Wais. lues Mainly in the hills from the Persian Gulf to the northern end of the Pusht-i-Kuh country, 30-40 miles south of Q&lt;isr-i-Shlrln, where they border on the Kurds. In northern Aiabistan and Behbehan Lurs and cross-breeds of Lur, Arab, and Persian Mood are found in the plains under the hills. For Faili Lurs in towns on the Tigris and Shatt el-Hai see p. 108. The numbers of the Lurs are very variously estimated. Perhaps the hill-tribes who range within the limits of the area dealt with here, including the Kuhgalu, the Bakhtiyari, the tribes who appear at certain seasons in the neighbourhood of Dizful, and the Faili Lurs of the Pusht-i-Kuh, do not amount to much more than a quarter of a million souls. But most estimates of these groups would make their total much greater. Ethnologically the Lurs are related to the Persians and Kurds, though they would consider it an insult to be classed with the Kurds, whom they despise. They speak, in various dialects, a language of their own which is allied to Kurdish and Persian, and shows the effects of contact with the Arabs. The Lurs as a whole have occupied their country from time immemorial, though par ticular tribes may have shifted their ground within this country comparatively recently. All these groups of mountain-tribes are at least mainly nomadic or semi-nomadic. They cultivate the ground, and often have permanent villages near their fields, but being mainly dependent on their live stock, they are obliged to move with the seasons between the high and the low pastures. They live in tents either all the year round or when they move from their villages with their flocks and herds. In general they bear the usual character of wild highlanders. The Lurs may possibly supply Mesopotamia with a useful quantity of labour. They are employed almost exclusively by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 6 whose experience is that the Lur is more likely to stay continuously at the same job, and, therefore, better able to develop into a skilled workman than the Arab'. [a] Kuhgalu. The bulk of the Kuhgalu are a little-known collec tion of mountain-tribes living at the southern end of the moun tain-belt from south of Lurdagan to the Gulf. Their country is difficult of access, being cut off from the plains by a lofty range of limestone mountains. In dialect, manners, and customs they re-INHABITANTS 107 11 semble the Bakhtiyari, but they live a more secluded life than the ' latter, and are wilder and more lawless. They are more or less nomadic, but their annual migrations are shorter than those of the Bakhtiyari, and are often restricted to movements between the valley- bottoms and the neighbouring mountain-slopes. L-j There are also Kuhgalu in the plains under the hills between ' ;iif' an d the Gulf near Bandar Dilam. Some of these are nomadic, but most are sedentary. The numbers of the non-sedentary Kuhgalu are quite uncertain. An estimate of 1910 gives them 25,000 families (100,000 souls?), * but this is probably an exaggeration. Some ot the Bahmai Kuhgalu in the Eamuz district are subject to the Bakhtiyari chiefs. The main body of the Kuhgalu are hostile to the Bakhtiyari. (h) The JBaJchtiydri occupy a great area of very difficult mountain- i _i country between the plains ot Arabistan and the Isfahan province, u i From the northern borders of Kuhgalu. their territory extends NW. ' F' to the upper Diz and the Faridan district. They are for the most id m part semi-nomadic, cultivating patches of crops, but moving every year considerable distances between their high pastures (e. g. on the it: ; ' northern or north-eastern side of the Garreh mountain) and the jsM lower valleys bordering Arabistan. Recently their chiefs have acquired a good deal of fertile land in northern Arabistan ; and *4f settled Bakhtiyari are to be found here as well as in parts of the : : a0if lower hill-country. The Bakhtiyari are of muscular build, but many of them are more or less broken by fever, rheumatism, and i(«ii eye-diseases. They are described as having the qualities usual perimiH among highland tribesmen—loyalty to tribal ties, courtesy and tkeitfe hospitality, dirt, thievishness, and a capacity for outbreaks of jltete savagery. Their chiefs have some tincture of civilization. The title of the paramount chief of the Bakhtiyari is Ilkhan; sub- ibj ordinate to him is the Ilbegi; and under these are a number of minor chiefs. The paramount chieftainship resides in two families— 1 fiaC Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani—belonging to the Haft Lang, the northern te iist' division of the Bakhtiyari. The custom is that the Ilkhan be j is Hi chosen from one of these families, the Ilbegi from the other. Before the war the Bakhtiyari chiefs farmed the tolls on the Lynch Eoad from Ahwaz to Isfahan, and had an agreement with pjit Messrs. Lynch for the upkeep of the road and its bridges. They also had an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company by which jgjlifi they furnished a guard for the protection of the company's oil-fields and pipe-line. The numbers of the Bakhtiyari are unknown. An estimate gives108 INHABITANTS them 240,000 souls, another would make them three times as strong as the Kuhgalu, who are put at 100,000. Both these estimates in their different degrees are probably much exaggerated. (c) Lurs between KJmrramabad and Dizful. The nomadic Lurs of the highlands above Dizful are noted mule-breeders—especially the Sagwand. They cultivate patches of ground both in the lower and in the higher valleys. The Sagwand descend in winter to the plains about Dizful, where they have made themselves troublesome by their depredations. The country between Dizful and Khurramabad had been in a state of anarchy for some time before the war. (d) The Faili Lurs are a group of tribes in Pusht-i-Kuh under the paramount chieftainship of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. They cultivate the lower valleys in winter and spring, and have some permanent villages here, but almost the whole body move into the mountains in summer. The summer quarters of the vali have usually been at Deh Bala under the Manisht Kuh, on a track from Kut el-Amara to Kirman- shah, but in 1916, to make sure that his neutrality would not be compromised, he retired to a spot on the Mama River near Zarinabad. There are colonies of Faili Lurs to be found in the towns and villages on the lower Tigris (Amara, Kut el-Amara, Bogheileh) and on the Shatt el-Hai (Kut el-Hai, Qalat Sikr). kueds Distribution North of Luristan (i. e. north of a line drawn from near Mandali eastwards to Kangavar) the Kurds are spread over all the hill- country which borders the Mesopotamian plain on the east and north, and along the edges of the plains under the hills. Within our area they are found : (a) In the Persian province of Kirmanshah and in the hills of southern Turkish Kurdistan ; some Kurdish tribes moreover spend a part of the year in the plains east of the middle Tigris, where they are in contact with the Arabs. (Beyond the eastern limit of our area the Kurds in Persian territory extend about as far as the line Mianduab—Bijar—Kangavar.) (&amp;) In central Kurdistan, where they live interspersed with other elements of the population—Armenian and 4 Syrian ? Christian. Some of their tribes move between the high central Kurdish moun tains, or the Van plateau, and the lower valleys and the plains north and north-east of Mosul and near Jezlret-ibn-'Omar.fill INHABITANTS 109 (c) In the country between the eastern Taurus ranges, forming the northern limit of our area, and the great plains of the Jezlreh. Here also they form a part of a mixed population, which includes Armenians, 'Syrian' Christians (Jacobites), Turkomans, &amp;c. Kurdish tribes descend to the northern edges of the Jezlreh plains for some months of the year and come into contact with the Arabs. (Beyond the eastern Taurus the Kurds are spread over the Armenian plateau, and are found in eastern Anatolia.) The Kurds within our area probably number less than 500,000. Race, Language, Modes The Kurds are mainly of Iranian stock, but in some regions they include a good deal of wreckage and cross-breeds of other races (Aramaean, Arab, &amp;c.). and the name covers a very heterogeneous collection of tribes. The race is on the whole least mixed in southern Kurdistan (Turkish and Persian), though even here on the Turkish side there is known to be a certain amount of Arab blood in some of the Kurdish communities. The main body of the Kurds speak many dialects of Kermanji, a language allied to Persian. The Zaza group of ti-ibes, which speaks what may be regarded as a language of its own, though of Iranian type, is found mainly north of the eastern Taurus. Mixtures of Kermanji and Aramaic (Syriac) and of Kermanji and Arabic occur here and there. The Kurds outside the towns are partly nomads or semi-nomads, and partly settled cultivators. Almost all are tribally organized, and the sedentary as well as the nomad communities are usually addicted to tribal feuds, raiding, and general lawlessness. Among the nomads and semi-nomads there is the movement between the lower and the higher grazing-grounds which is usual among pastoral hill-tribes. Sometimes they move considerable dis tances, e.g. from the neighbourhood of JezIret-ibn-'Omar up to the Van plateau. The tribes who winter in the plains east of the Tigris mostly go up in summer to the Persian plateau (e. g. to the Wazneh district). Many of the sedentary Kurds are industrious cultivators. There is a Kurdish element in the population of most of the towns in the hill-country, and sometimes, e. g. at Suleimaniyeh, Koi Sanjaq, Kowanduz, Amadiyeh, Bitlis, it predominates. Great differences of character are found among the Kurdish tribes. Some are described as very low sets of thieves, e. g. some of the tribes frequenting central Kurdistan and others in the Qarajeh Dagh. But the Kurds of most tribes—nomad or settled—though they may110 INHABITANTS be brigands and murderers, are fine men in their way, especially perhaps where the Iranian blood is purest or mixed only with good Arab blood. It is remarkable that Englishmen who have travelled in Kurdistan generally show a strong liking for the typical Kurd. The other races of Mesopotamia are inclined to look down on him as a stupid and dangerous animal; and the Kurd is often strangely ready to admit his mental inferiority. Yet the Kurd often shows considerable practical shrewdness. He has not the subtlety and imagination of the Arab, but of the two he is the more industrious and capable worker. In danger he is steadier and cooler than the Arab ; he has a better physique (the Kurd is generally of big-boned, muscular build ; the small, wiry Zazas form a special type which hardly appears within our area). Altogether, compared with the Arab, the Kurd has greater physical and mental stamina. But he is also more callous than the Arab, and is extra ordinarily reckless about taking human life. He is capable at times of extreme brutality ; and of that and of his courage and simplicity the Turkish Government has taken advantage. On the other hand he is often jovial and good-humoured, hospitable, and in some ways frank and loyal, though in war and brigandage he is little hampered by scruples of good faith. The best Kurdish tribes treat their women remarkably well, and respect them. As fighters the Kurds are generally brave and determined. The semi-nomadic Kurds are admirable horsemen, and it has been thought that they might provide material for an excellent mounted infantry. The Kurd has the makings of a good cultivator and a good work man. He has generally neither the good nor the bad qualities that are likely to make a successful trader. In religion the Kurds of this area are mostly Sunnis, but there are some Shiah tribes among them. (See Chapter VIII.) Kurdish Of the many Kurdish tribes or tribal groups within our area the following are some of the more important: (a) BetweenLuristan and the LineBitUs— —Jeslret-ihn- Omar (The tribes in this section are arranged approximately in order from south to north.) Kalhur (3,000 horsemen ?). In Persian territory ; summer in mountains NW. of Pusht-i-Kuh, winter in plains of Zohab and Qasr-i-Shlrln. Mainly nomadic, but some sections are sedentary. There are twelve divisions of Kalhur. A powerful tribe.\\ si] I INHABITANTS 111 Sinjahi (1,000 horsemen ?). Mahldesht district; nomads and noted mule-breeders. Guran (3,000 horsemen ?). In the country NW. of the Mahldesht plain, towards the plain of Zohab where the nomad sections of the tribe winter. Jaff (4,000 horsemen ?). This group winters in the country east of Kufri and about Khanikin, and for the summer moves northwards via Halebjeh to the Penjevin district; a part of it has been in the habit of going farther and crossing the frontier into Persian territory, where it pillaged the country-side. Some sections (e. g. Sadani and Badaghi) occasionally winter west of the Diyaleh between Chaman Koprii and Qara Bulaq. The Jaff group, formerly very powerful, is in a state of disintegration, the family of its paramount chiefs (the Begzadeh of the Pushtamala section) having lost almost all influence. The family still owns considerable property in Suleimaniyeh, Halebjeh, Penjevin, and Qizil Eibat. The depredations of the .Jaff were the cause of much friction.between Turkey and Persia. The Bajlan, on the left bank of the Diyaleh north of Qasr-i-Shlrln, formerly belonged to the Jaff group, but are now separated from it owing to blood-feuds, which are still kept up. The Bajlan used to furnish a guard for the Chlah Surkh oil-wells. Hamawand (2,000 souls ?). Between Kirkuk and Suleimaniyeh. The centre of the Hamawand country is the Baziyan valley in the Qara Dagh. Semi-nomadic. Very famous as raiders and fighters. Baudiyeh (4,000 families ?). In the plains east of the Tigris, on the banks of the Lesser Zab. Warlike semi-nomads. D'sdiyeh (or 'Dizzai'? 5,000 families?). Between Altun Koprti and Erbil and about the Qara Chok Dagh ; head-quarters at Makhmur. Mainly sedentary. Shuan (15,000 souls ?). In the hills north of Kirkuk and east of Altun Koprii. Apparently a strong but fairly quiet tribe. Sheikh Bezeini (4,000 families ?). Villagers in country NNE. of Altun Koprti; move to Wazneh Pass in summer. ' A great and warlike tribe, turbulent and fierce.' Noted robbers. Make Martini- Henry rifles. Girdi (6,000 families '?). East of Erbil, about Ashqaf Saqqa ; move to Wazneh district in summer. A powerful tribe. There is a sedentaiy branch of the Girdi SW. of Shemsdinan. Khoshnao (2,000 families ?). About Shakhlawa. Sedentary; are said to work for the Girdi and Sheikh Bezeini and to be unwarlike. There are apparently other Khoshnao south of Rowanduz about Belassan. Mengur (2,000 families ?). Lahjan plain, Pishdir plain, Eaniyeh112 INHABITANTS plain, and, in summer, Wazneh highlands. Warlike semi-nomads. (See below under BiTbas.) Mamash (2.000 families ?). About Passova (NE. of Lahjan plain), between Suj Bulaq and Lesser Zab, and in Raniyeh plain ; in summer at Wazneh. (See below under Silbas.) Piran (900 families?). Lahjan and Eaniyeh plains and Wazneh highlands. Semi-nomadic. Warlike robbers. Pishdir. In mountains south of Ser Desht; descend to Marga plain ; a small tribe^ but with a reputation for being fierce and warlike. BiTbas. Given by Sykes as a semi-nomadic tribe of 400 families, on the Turco-Persian frontier near Raniyeh. In Mil. E. T. A., vol. iii, 'Bilbas' is apparently used as a general term for a number of tribes on both sides of the frontier in the region of Wazneh ; and the agha of a section of Mengur (see above), at Elwatan, is described as 4 theoretically head of all the Bilbas The Mamash, who in Mil. Report on E. T. A. are placed under the heading ^ Bilbas Kurdsare said by Soane to be a section of the Mukri of the Suj Bulaq district. JBalihi (1,000 rifles ?). East of Eowanduz. Pirastini (1,100 families?). North-east of Eowanduz. Sedentary. SurJchi (800 families?). West of Eowanduz on both sides of the Great Zab. Partly sedentary, partly nomadic. Baradost (2,000 families ?). In the Baradost district some twenty- live miles NNW. of Eowanduz. SMrwan (1,800 families?). North-westerly neighbours of the Baradost. Sedentary ; warlike. Zebar (30 villages?). In the district of that name west of the Great Zab and of Baradost. Warlike. At feud with the Sheikhs of Berzan. JBerzan (^50 families?). North of Zebar on the left bank of the Zab. Warlike. The Sheikhs of Berzan are holy and therefore influential. Shemsdinan (20 villages?). In the Shemsdinan district, under the Sheikh of Neri, who derives considerable importance from his hereditary holiness. Ilerihi. ^ A large, widely-scattered group of nomads. Sections of the Heriki range in the country west, north, and east of Shemsdinan. Branches of the Heriki are found near Mosul and also about Erzerum. The Heriki are apparently rather a low class of Kurds. They generally move in small detachments. Shekah (6,000 families?). On the Persian frontier north of Diza. A confederation of several semi-nomadic tribes. A southern, nomad^ ® I INHABITANTS ] 13 branch of the Shekak ranges between Baradost and the Persian frontier. . PinianisJili. A large group, the head of a confederacy of tribes. i' 5 ' ln the Hakidari highlands east of the Great Zab valley. Hartoshi. A large and powerful group, mainly consisting of nomads, who range between the Zakho district, on the Mosul plains, and the highlands south of Lake Van. According to Sykes the Sharafan are the largest section of the Hartoshi (3,000 families) and ' descend south of Aqreh in spring'. According to on E. T. A. the Sharafan number only 150 tents, and the largest sections are the Gavdan (300 tents) and the Mamkhoran (15 villages). .'•iiffji The Gavdcin are found in the valley of that name, and also, in ilteimli summer, on the Maidan-i-Lalishi, and, in spring, near Zakho. They are said by Sykes to have had a bad reputation as thieves. The ulionjii Mamkhoran (in the valley of that name and, in summer, on the I iarishi Yaila) are described by Sykes as 'very warlike nomads'. Mir an. A large tribe of nomads who move between the Mesopo- iondl tamian plains, near Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, and Lake Van. The Miran, who have a bad reputation among their neighbours, were at the head of a large confederation in central Kurdistan until their chief, Sdfliliij, Mustafa Pasha, was slain in battle with the Goyan.

The eldest, Abdul Hamid (generally known as Hamud), died in captivity; the others—Mamu (now about 80), Ismail (28), Khalil Pasha (26), Abdul Rahman (18), and Tama (16)—were at length released, and a part of their father's estates was restored to them.

It gives their rifles as 250, but this number may have greatly increased in recent years. The tribe is warlike and turbulent. Mirm. See above, p. 113. OTHEE GEOXJPS Turks and Turkomans. (a) In the cities of Diarbekr and Urfeh, and in the districts between Diarbekr and the Euphrates there is a Turkish-speaking element in the population. There are apparently some nomad Turkomans in the Diarbekr vilayet. (&amp;) There are settled Turkomans west of Mosul at Tel A'far, and also in the plains east of Mosul. (c) There is a settled Turkoman population in a narrow strip of country along the western border of the southern Kurdish hills, extending from the neighbourhood of Altun Kcipru through Kirkuk to Tuz Khurmatli. They form the main part of the urban population at Altun KOprti and Kirkuk. {d) In some of the towns of Irak (and especially, it seems, in Baghdad) there are to be found persons claiming to be Turks, often without justification. (e) There are a few nomad Turkomans in northern Arabistan. SyrianQhristians. (a) Ghaldaeans (including both the Arabic- speaking and the Syrian-speaking sections, and Chaldaean Uniates and Chaldaean ' Nestorians', see p. 132). These are found chiefly in the country north and east of Mosul, in the plains and lower hills, and in the Hakkiari mountains of central Kurdistan, on both sides of the Zab valley (and eastwards, beyond the limits of our area, inINHABITANTS 115 ' ^ nu 1 *!? 11 territor y ir ! . the Urmia—Salmas district).

Possibly both groups together numbered within our area some thing between 100,000 and 200,000 before the present war. But »iiiii ' Nestonan' Chaldaean mountaineers, who may have been i rei somewhere about 50,000 strong in 1914, lost terribly in 1915, and a large part of them had to flee to Persian territory. The Jacobites suffered a good deal in certain districts. The Syrian Christians probably represent in the main an Aramaic population which lived in upper Mesopotamia before the Arab con quest. But in the plains and foot-hills they are much mixed with Arab blood and speak Arabic. In some of the villages of the Tur « b Abdin, and probably elsewhere, they speak Kurdish. Aramaic »» (Synac) is the language of the 4 Nestorian ' Chaldaeans of the central Kurdish mountains. The Chaldaeans and Jacobites of the plains and lower hill-country AM are mainly a rural population of sedentary village-dwelling cultivators. In the towns they are traders and artisans. They work on the Tigris rafts between Diarbekr and Mosul, and Chaldaeans of Tel rJislij Kaif, a village north of Mosul, used to form the crews of the river- ;liP steamers on the lower Tigris in Irak. The 'Nestorians' of the Hakkiari country are tribally organized, sedentary mountaineers of the ordinary type. They are under the see®,! paramount chieftainship of their Patriarch, Mar' Shimum, who Aoli before the war resided at Kochannes near Julamerk. His Nestorian tribes occupied the neighbourhood of the Zab valley from the Tiari * district, some ten or twelve miles north of Amadiyeh, to the neigh- ie it* bourhood of the Harefta Dagh above Julamerk. They are a brave uP and warlike people, who have fought well against their Kurdish ^ { lil neighbours and enemies, and recently against the Turks. 0^ ^ may be noted that * Syrian' is generally used as equivalent ^tlsit to Christian in upper Mesopotamia. rjr (i,ii Armenians. Within our area there was, in 1914, a considerable B 2lie INHABITANTS population of Armenians in the northern part of the central Kurdish highlands south of Lake Van, and on the south side of the eastern Taurus in the country north of Diarbekr. The Armenians here formed a southward extension of the main body of the race. There were large Armenian elements in the population of Bitlis, Sairt, Diarbekr, and Urfeh ; there was an Armenian colony at Mardln ; and there were some thousands of Armenians in Baghdad. The total number of Armenians in upper Mesopotamia in 1914 was probably something between one hundred and two hundred thousand. On the massacres, deportations, and flight of Armenians in 1915, and on the introduction of Armenian deportees into the plains of the Jezlreh and the middle Euphrates valley see p. 88. The Armenian villagers and cultivators who are (or were) to be found in the highlands south of Lake Van, in the eastern Taurus ranges, among the southern foot-hills of those mountains, and in the lowlands of Diarbekr, were peasants. The urban Armenians were merchants, shopkeepers, &amp;c. The typical Armenian of the towns was an astute man of business and an ardent nationalist, who had an unfortunate faculty for making himself disliked by the Government and his neighbours. Jews. —There are Jewish communities in most of the towns, notably at Baghdad, where they seem to form the largest racial group. The Jews are merchants, usurers, and shopkeepers. The rich Jewish merchants at Baghdad form a very wealthy and influential community, and have to a great extent eclipsed their Mohammedan and Oriental Christian rivals. But the mass of Jews in the Meso- potamian towns are poor and engaged in very petty business. On Jewish places of pilgrimage in Irak see pp. 134-5. Persians. There are Persian communities in the towns of Arabistan. In Irak they are to be found in many of the towns, but are concentrated especially at the Shiah holy cities: thus at Kerbela they form the majority of the population, at Nejef about a third. At Baghdad there are some thousands of them, and they occur in the towns of Kurdistan, where the most important Persian colony on the Turkish side of the border seems to be that at Suleimaniyeh. Yesidis. Their main strength is in the Jebel Sinjar, which they have to themselves. They occur between the Jebel Sinjar and Mosul. There are a good many Yezidi villages in the country east and north of Mosul. At Sheikh Adi, some twenty-seven miles north of Mosul, is the principal Yezidi shrine. The Yezidis speak a dialect of Kurdish, and probably have moreI. Si INHABITANTS jjy or less Kurdish blood in them, but they form a very distinctly marked group, owing to their peculiar religion, which has cut them oil irom their neighbours and has made them disliked and feared by r nlfw Z alike (see pp - 133 - 4 )- The y are mostly settled cultivatois, though there are some Yezidi nomads between Mosul and the Jebel Sinjar. Travellers generally describe them as a harm less, peaceable tolk, but the Yezidis of the Jebel Sinjar appear to e a lathei wild set, capable of fighting in their own defence and ot raiding out into the plains, as they are said to have done in the present war. The Yezidis of the Sinjar are organized in a number of tribes, rru™ i 111 important at present appear to be : . lh , e ™ r ? J (under Mzhmnde-Uz or el-Bajwal), who number only about 100 fighting-men, but are renowned for their fierceness. Their chief is said to control the northern part of the Sinjar. perhaps by having the Jowana (400 men) and the Aldaki (100 men) as his allies. m, Ua ? ,u ! l e1 ' Kal11 6 Kesum), numbering about 600 fiffhtins men. Ihe head-quarters of their chief are at Sukeni (Sekenik?) in the south-west part of the Sinjar, and he is said to control the southern part of the region. The Samukha (under Mato Lalo or Ahmed Lalo) in about six villages m the plain to north-west of the mountain. Their strength is esti mated at 1,200 guns. Their chief guards the Sinjar on the west. Accordmg to another account the paramount chief of the Siniar fezidis is Hamo Sharo, who is said to be about 85 years old and to AT ou ln ? e C ® nt 1 re of the Sin i ar - (He may be the no knaro mentioned elsewhere as chief of the Fakir tribe ) The same account gives the following Yezidi tribes of the Sinjar country as important: J 'rfMythe Mihrka, 200 guns, east of the Sinjar lange) ;chief, Sheikh Daud. ,, ' Taraf '' (Possibly the tribe called elsewhere the Jefra, 50 guns, on the north side of the mountains); chief, Husein Birjis.

In lower Irak, chiefly at Nasirlyeh. They are said not118 INHABITANTS to number more than two or three thousand. On their religion see p. 134. They are craftsmen—boat-builders, goldsmiths, &amp;c. Circassians. Very few are left of the Circassian Mohammedans settled in Mesopotamia by the Turkish Government after the Kussian war of 1877-8. Their numbers have been reduced by their failure to adapt themselves to the climate and by quarrels with their neigh bours. There are small Circassian villages at Eas el- c Ain and at Kaqqah. There appear to be a few Circassians in the vilayet of Diarbekr. They are a high-spirited, warlike people. Indians, Afghans, Pathans. Mostly at Basra, Mohammareh, Baghdad, Kerbela, and Nejef. They have been noticed on p. 95. Unimportant groups are: the Shubbaks, of unknown origin, living east of the middle Tigris, apparently in the region of Erbil ; they are said to number about 500 families (see further p. 135); the Bajwan east of Mosul, estimated at 800 families ; and the [Nowar) near Hovek and Urfeh. Lastly, in the Diarbekr vilayet there are a few Qizilbash com munities. The Qizilbash, most of whom live on the Armenian plateau and in eastern Anatolia, speak a dialect of Kurdish. Their origin is unknown. Europeans. The total number of Europeans resident in the country before the war was perhaps between two and three hundred; they were missionaries (French, British, and Ameiican), representatives of commercial enterprises and engineers (chiefly British and German), consuls, and archaeologists. The missionaries were principally in upper Mesopotamia ; the Europeans engaged in business or engineer ing were mostly in Irak and Arabistan. The principal European business communities were at Baghdad, Basra, and Mohammareh. Except among the missionaries, there were hardly any Europeans who were permanently settled in the country. Peincipal Languages In lower Mesopotamia Arabic, Lur dialects, Kurdish dialects, and Persian are spoken, the distribution of languages following the distribution of races described above. Arabic naturally predominates in Irak and southern Arabistan, but Persian has considerable importance for commerce, especially of course in Arabistan and Kirmanshah. In upper Mesopotamia, Arabic and Kurdish are the principal languages ; of these Arabic is far the more important for commercialINHABITANTS 119 • ,,' w purposes, being not only generally spoken in the plains of the Jezlreh, but being also more or less in use and understood at such trade-centres in the northern hills as Urfeh, Mardln, Diarbekr, Sairt. It is of course the predominant language at Mosul. At the trade- - centre of Suleimaniyeh, while Kurdish is generally spoken, Persian is widely understood. Various dialects of Turkish are spoken by the Turks and Turkomans. Other languages are Armenian and Syriac, The latter is spoken -fei by the Christian tribes in the highlands of central Kurdistan. See above, p. 115. It may be noticed that there are marked forms of patois here and there, the result of a mixture of languages. For example, Shushtar ■ ' : and Dizful has each its own speech, apparently compounded of Arabic, Lur, and Persian. As regards European languages, the commercial and social pre- w:: dominance of French in other parts of the Turkish Empire has Amn its influence on Mesopotamia. There is a certain acquaintance bIl lit with French to be found among members of the business class in the chief trade-centres. The higher Turkish officials usually had some, though often a very imperfect, knowledge of this language; : and it has been spread by the educational work of French Catholic .missions as well as by Jewish schools. Before the war some knowledge of English was possessed by persons—chiefly Christians jfJki of northern Mesopotamia—who had visited America or had been ( m £ educated in American mission schools. A few men of business rwere acquainted with English, but it seems to have been much less Ujjui widely known than French, even where, as at Baghdad, British commercial influence was predominant. Since 1914 acquaintance with English has naturally spread among the population of the area occupied by the British. Education While Kerbela and Nejef are flourishing seats of Shiah religious ' C learning, the general level of education among the Mohammedans of Mesopotamia is very low. In the elementary schools attached to the mosques the pupils are taught to repeat, read, and copy the Koran. • In the Holy Cities are more advanced religious schools. Turkish ^ Grovernment schools (mostly primary) existed in and near some of the principal towns. But in subjects other than Moslem theology and religious law the most important educational work done in the120 INHABITANTS country has been that of the mission schools (American, French Catholic, and English), whose influence was exercised chiefly on the Oriental Christians. There are also Jewish, Armenian, and Chaldaean schools. Thus the native Christians and Jews have been considerably better educated for practical purposes, such as business, than the Mohammedans. In the area occupied by the British the organization and extension of education have been taken in hand.(g) ■ Fkki !«lk a. ui ttflu Js CHAPTER VIII EELIGIONS Islam—Christian sects—Yezidis—Sabians—Jews—Qizilbash and Sliabbaks. Islam The preponderance of Islam in Mesopotamia rests not only on the great numerical superiority of Moslems over non-Moslems, but also on the historic part played by Irak in the development of the Moham medan power and faith. It was here that the events occurred which gave birth to the Shiah schism, here too was the seat of the Baghdad Caliphate, and here—at Kerbela, Kazimain, Nejef, and Kufeh—are shrines venerated at least equally with Mecca and Medina in Shiah Moslem estimation. Tenets The tenets of Islam, which claims to be a divinely revealed religion, given to the world by Mohammed as the last of a succession of inspired messengers, may be briefly summarized under (a) (h) (a) The doctrine and practices are to be found in (i) the Book of God — the Koran—which was sent down from the highest heaven to Gabriel in the lowest, who revealed it in turn by sections to Mohammed ; (ii) the collections of tradition {hadith) containing the sayings and manners of life {sunna) of the Prophet; (iii) the use of analogy as applied to (i) and (ii) ; (iv) the universal consent (ijma) of the believers. Orthodox Islam recognizes the Koran as the work not of Mohammed, but of God; but Moslem theologians recognized some revelations as inconsistent with others, and so developed the doctrine of nasikh and mansukh (abrogation), whereby it is taught that in certain definite cases a later revelation supersedes an earlier. Upon the nature of God Islam is very explicit. God is one and uni versal from the beginning. His unity being emphasized as against the Christian Trinity. The cosmology of Mohammedanism is too elaborate to be here reproduced, but some reference to its ethics is essential. These latter are based on belief {iman), good works, complete surrender to God's will as the necessary condition of religious life, and fear of His judgement. The eschatology of the122 RELIGIONS Koran includes resurrection, last judgement, paradise^, and hell. Qiyas is the process by which a belief or practice is justified on the ground that something similar is expressly enjoined by the Koran, tradition, or ijma. Ijma is the universal consent, which is held to justify practices or beliefs, although they are not warranted by the Koran or tradition, and may be inconsistent with the teaching ot one or both. Law in Mohammedan countries is in theory essentially religious, based on the Koran and the traditions (see further on this point pp. 146-7). (6) The acts of worship enjoined by Islam are five in number : (i) the recital of the creed ; (ii) observance of the five daily prayers ; (iii) fast in the month of Ramadan ; (iv) giving of alms ; (v) the pilgrimage to Mecca. The creed ('there is no God but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God ') is the main article of belief, to be professed without hesitation at any time until death. The consist of prescribed ejaculations, petitions, and recital of parts of the Koran, accompanied by certain gestures of the body, at the following five stated times : dawn, just after noon, before sunset, just after sunset, and after the day has closed. The worshipper must be in a state ot ceremonial cleanness, for which certain ablutions are required. In order to prevent contact with anything unclean, prayer is usually performed on a praying-carpet. The extent to which this obligation is discharged varies greatly in different places, and with social and other conditions: it is on the whole more scrupulously observed in the towns than in the desert, and by the poor than by the rich. Where prayer is offered in assembly, there is a leader who repeats the formulae in front of the congregation. The where public prayer is offered, has one or more minarets, from the top of which the muezzin call the devout to prayer at the appointed time. Attendance at public prayer is theoretically obligatory on Fridays at noon, when a short sermon of about 5 minutes' length is delivered. Hostility may be aroused by Christians who at any time enter, or show curiosity in, a mosque; this applies especially to the principal Shiah mosques. The fast is in the month Ramadan, ' wherein the Koran was revealed': it is perhaps borrowed from the Jews or Eastern Christians. By fasting is meant abstinence from food, solid and liquid, and from smoking from sunrise to sunset. Owing to the fact that the Moslem calendar is lunar, Ramadan falls at dif ferent periods in different years. In 1919 it will last from May 31 to June 30. The fast, when it comes in summer, is a cause of great suffering to those who observe it, who are the same class as those who perform their prayer with regularity. So far as is possible the inconvenience is met by sleeping in daytime. The fast is thoughtlil EELIGIONS 128 not to be incumbent on those who are travelling or on service, though they should compensate tor such neglect by fasting at another period ot the year. The day which follows the end of Ramadan is one of the great feasts of the year, the other being the tenth day of the month of pilgrimage. That month in 1919 will begin on August 28. Other feasts are not common to the whole Moslem world, but are merely sectarian. Alms are of two kinds, legal and determined and voluntary (sadaqat). The pilgr {Hajj) is to be performed once by every Moslem ' if he is ablethat is, if he can provide or obtain the means to support himself on pilgrimage and his family during his absence, and if he is physically capable. Food and Drink Taboos. —The pig is as much of an abomination to the Moslem as to the Jew, from whom this taboo seems to have been taken over by Islam, The normal sentiment is also veiy strongly against the use of wines, spirits, &amp;c. ; though there is a certain amount of laxity in this matter among Moslems accustomed to European ways. The use of tobacco is very widespread, though it has been condemned by certain of the more recent sects, and opinion in religious circles has recently been setting against it. Denominations The two chief denominations of Islam are the Sunni and the Shiah sects. In the southern part of our area—that is, in Irak, Arabistan, and the neighbouring Persian highlands—the very great majority of Moslems are Shiahs. In the north—that is, in the Jezireh and in Turkish Kurdistan—the great majority of Moslems are Sunnis (the Arabs of the Jezireh are practically all Sunnis ; there are some Shiah tribes among the Kurds). In Baghdad there are more Sunnis than Shiahs. Persia is Shiah, Arabia Sunni. In northern Irak are the Shiah holy cities, the objects of Shiah pilgrimage from all parts of the world, and especially from Persia and India. (See immediately below and p. 125.) (a) Shiah The division between Sunni and Shiah is based primarily on political theory. The Sunnis regard as legitimate successors of the Prophet the first three Caliphs who ruled as heads of the Moslem community, whereas the Shiahs hold that they and all the Caliphs who followed them were usurpers, the rightful succession lying in their view with Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, and with Ali's descendants. Ali himself, who was assassinated at Kufeh. his son Hasan, who is said to have been murdered at the instigation124 RELIGIONS of the Caliph Mo awlyeh at Medina, and above all Husein, the second son of 'Ali, who with his followers was slain at Kerbela by the troops of Yazid, Mo'awlyeh's successor, are venerated by the Shiahs as martyrs and even as semi-divine. These persons, in the senti ment if not in the theory of the Shiahs, almost take precedence of the Prophet himself. Shiah religious feeling centres especially round the story of Husein's death, which is commemorated on the 10th Moharrem, the first month, which in 1919 will begin on September 26. The inspiration and semi-divine powers that belonged to the true head of the Moslem world were continued in a series of Imams or Mahdls, the last of whom is believed to have dis appeared mysteriously either at Nejef or at Samarra in a.d . 873, This Imam, or a reincarnation of Husein, is expected to return some day to establish the true faith among men. Meanwhile the Shiahs may give their adhesion to the constituted temporal autho rities of the countries in which they live. The Sultan of Turkey may be obeyed as Sultan, though not as Caliph. The Shiah system of belief, which arose in Irak and spread to Persia and India, has accumulated round it much mystical theology and philosophy which are abhorrent to Sunnis as perverting or, in their view, contradicting the revelation of the Koran. The sects also differ in a number of points connected with ceremonial: e. g._ whereas the Sunnis recognize meat slaughtered by Jews and Christians as lawful, the Shiahs do not. Shiah Shrines in Mesopotamia—The Shiah shrines of Mesopotamia may be divided into three groups: (i) those connected with the death of 'Ali, (ii) those connected with the battle of Kerbela, and (iii) those connected with Imams later than Husein. (i) Sacred places associated with the of Ali. —The spot where Ali received his mortal wound is still shown at Kufeh, enclosed by iron gratings, in the great mosque li mile from the present town. His reputed tomb is at Nejef, though some authorities maintain that he was buried where he fell, at Kufeh. The tomb rises in the centre oi the town of Nejef, and surpasses in splendour even the shrine of Husein at Kerbela. The town about it contains a population of 30,000, most of whom live on doles from pilgrims. ^ (ii) Scicvcd places connected with the haitlc Kevhelu. —The authenticity of the shrines at Kerbela is not disputed. They are five in number 1. The tomb of Husein, called Dargah Hazrat Husein, stands in the old town towards its western end. It consists of a large enclosure [Sahri) with seven entrances, in the midst of which stands the or sanctuary proper, surmounted by a lofty dome. The 72 martyrs {Shuhada), who died with Husein, are buried in the same place.EELTGIONS 125 2. The tomb of Abbas, half-brother of Husein, is situated taither east. It is similar to, but smaller than, Husein's. '■ ^ Khniniahgali marks the site of Husein's tent befoi'e the battle. It is small and unpretentious. 4. The tomb of Aun, Husein's sister's son, is 7 miles NE, of Kerbela on the road to Museyib. 5. The tomb of Hurr, who joined Husein from the ranks of his enemies just before the battle, is 3 miles to the north-west. (iii) Saci cdplciccs connected with Initims. —At Kazimain is the burial-place of the 7th and 9th Imams, Musa-bin-Tafar and Mohammed-bin-'Ali {Kadhim, 1 the self-constrained '). The tombs of the 10th and 11th Imams, Ali-bin-Mohammed and Hasan-bin-'Ali, are to be seen at Samarra, where also a well is exhibited, said to be the scene of the disappearance of Mohammed-bin-Hasan el-Mahdi, 12th Imam. Other minor shrines are those of Abul Qasim and Seyyid Ibrahim at Museyib ; Hamzah and Yasim at Hilla; and Ibn el-Hasan, the Banat el-Hasan, and Ibn el-Hamzah near Tawarlj. The management of these Shiah shrines is vested in the Auqaf or Department of Religious Endowments. At each principal shrine there is a custodian (Mliddar), chief attendant {sarkhidmah), and lesser attendants (khadim). The Auqaf are responsible for the finances of the shrines, which are supported partly by large endowments in the shape of lands, houses, and shops, partly by special contributions ; and for the sacred treasure, the value of which is not known even approximately to outsiders. . SMah Pilgrimages.—A pilgrimage to the shrines of Irak is con sidered by Shiahs to be highly meritorious, more especially because it is voluntary, instead of being obligatory like the to Mecca or Medina. There is no fixed time for these pilgrimages, though certain days of the Mohammedan year are considered more auspicious than others for the performance of the ceremonies prescribed for visitors to the holy places; consequently pilgrims arrive and depart at all seasons of the year, preferably however in winter, between November and April. 1. wo routes are commonly followed : pilgrims from north western Persia cross the frontier at Khanikin ; those from southern Persia, India, and the I ersian Gulf arrive by sea at Basra. In ordinary circumstances 150,000-200,000 pilgrims may visit Mesopotamia in a year. Probably far more have made the journey in recent years, and there is also an immense pilgrim traffic from within the bounds of Mesopotamia itself. Some aspects of these migrations have already been discussed, for instance their share in the dis semination of disease (p. 68), and they supply a considerable stimulus to trade both external and internal. Each band of pilgrims120 RELIGIONS has a conductor, who cai'ries a flag inscribed with a text from the Koran or with the names of the Imams. Pilgrims coming by land from Persia ordinarily visit Kazimain first, thereafter pro ceeding to Kerbela and Nejef; and this is the course followed by most of the pilgrims from the Gulf, who take the river-steamer from Basra to Baghdad. Arrived at the shrine, the pilgrim first purifies himself by certain prescribed ablutions. At the threshold he seeks the saint's permission to approach, circumambulates the grave three times, and finally prostrates himself twice before the tomb, to an accompaniment throughout of prayers and reci tations. The visit to the shrine is called and the pilgrims provide themselves at the shrines with rosaries, tablets of sacred earth {t'lirhah), and shrouds for future use, stamped with texts from the Koran. ConsecratedShiah Cemeteries. — The desire for burial in sacred ground at one or other of the holy places in Irak is based upon the belief that the protection of the saint there buried is thus assured. The principal Shiah cemeteries, apart from the shrines themselves, in whose precincts burials also take place, are the following: the Wadi es-Salam ('vale of peace') at Nejef; Wadi el-Aoman (' vale of security') at Kerbela; Maqabir el-Quraish at Kazimain ; and Tarmah at Samarra. Corpses are brought for interment in one or other of these places by caravan in wooden coffins covered with thick felt. A pack-animal with a coffin slung each side of it is one of the commonest objects to be encountered on a journey from Kerbela to Baghdad. The cost of burial in this way is by no means nominal. Apart from the expense of carriage, the Turkish Government charged the equivalent of nine shillings for an import pass, half this sum being levied in addition for sanitary purposes. Corresponding fees, but on a lower scale, were levied on the transportation of Ottoman Shiah subjects. Quite independent again were the charges for actual interment, which varied from £40 (at Euwaq in Nejef) to 7s. 2d. (at Samarra). The introduction of bodies from countries where epidemic diseases prevail has been from time to time interdicted by the Porte, and since 1897 the importation of bodies from India has been prohibited on account of bubonic plague in that country. Shiah Mujtahids. —The term Mujtah was originally applied to any Mussulman divine who had attained the highest eminence in his profession. But at the present day it 'is in use only among Shiahs. The modern Shiah Mujtahid combines in himself several functions: lecturer on Mohammedan law and theology, judge of ecclesiastical suits, and registrar of wills and other documents, TheRELIGIONS 127 ascendancy which the recognized Mujtahids enjoy is very remark able. Among Shiahs their word is law: they disburse large sums received from their co-religionists for sacred and charitable pur poses ; and occasionally they exercise strong political influence, even in opposition to the established government of the country. The Mujtahids of Nejef and Kerbela are the most distinguished, their authority predominating throughout the entire Shiah world over that of all other Mujtahids: collectively they are known as Aatabah, 1 the Threshold Though some 2,000 claimants to the title exist at Nejef and 200 at Kerbela, inquiries made in 1903 elicited the fact that not more than 41 enjoyed undisputed authority. (6) Sun The historical origin of the differences between Sunni and Shiah has been noted above (p. 123). For most non-Arab Sunnis the Sultan of Turkey is Caliph, but his claim is little regarded by most Arabs. The Sunnis profess an unquestioning faith in the Koran, and in the accepted Tradition {sunna}, which is a record of the sayings and doings of the Prophet that serves as a supplement to the Koran. On this basis four principal systems of Sunni law have arisen. The official code of the Ottoman Empire, in so far as it is still truly Moslem, is that of the Hanifite school. The Shiahs in theory reject the authority of the Sunni Tradition altogether, but in fact their law is to a great extent borrowed from the Sunni schools. The Arab Sunnis of Mesopotamia are said to be on the whole not fanatical. Sunni feeling is now apparently stronger among the Kurds. The Government of Constantinople has done much in recent years to encourage Sunnism among the Kurdish tribes, in the hope of increasing their respect for the Sultan as Caliph. This policy apparently had a considerable measure of success in Abdul Hamid's reign. The most important Sunni shrine in Mesopotamia is that of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani, at Baghdad. This Abdul Qadir ( a. d . 1077-1165) was a Sufi preacher of renown in his day, being credited with miraculous powers. His mosque and tomb, honorifically known as ' Janab Ghauth el-Adham Dastgirform not only one of the principal sights of Baghdad, but a religious centre lyi frequented by Sunni Mussulmans from regions as remote as Afghani- L : stan and India. Poor pilgrims are gratuitously supported, and ', sometimes as many as 4,000 loaves of bread issue in a single day from the kitchens of the Pir-i-Dastgir. Other 'Sunni shrines exist in Irak, but none comparable with that of Sheikh Abdul Qadir, such being the Maqam Yunas at Kufeh and tomb of Ezekiel at Kifl,128 RELIGIONS though the latter is more venerated by Jews than Mussulmans. Much the most influential Sunni in Mesopotamia is the Naqib of Baghdad, the official head of the Arab community in that town. Appointments to the Naqibat have been made by the Sultan hereto fore, but in practice the succession is treated as hereditary: nor can there be any doubt that the importance of the Naqib in the present day depends much less upon Turkish recognition than upon his descent and position as the custodian of the shrine of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani. It is worthy of note that'extreme deference is paid to the Naqib of Baghdad and his family by many of the most influential and wealthy, as well as the humblest and poorest, of Indian and Afghan Moslems. Compared with this high dignitary of Baghdad, the Sunni Naqib of Basra is an inferior being, whose importance depends chiefly on his wealth and employment by the Turkish Government in political affairs. Christian Sects Some information regarding the numbers, distribution, organiza tion, &amp;c., of each of the various Christian sects which are represented in Mesopotamia and Kurdistan will be found on pp. 131-3. The great majority of Christians living in this area are to be found in the vilayets of Diarbekr, Bitlis, Van, and Mosul. There are also Christian communities in Baghdad, Basra, and some other towns of Irak. It is said that in the years preceding the war many Christians were driven by the attacks of the Kurds to migrate from the north to the towns of Irak. In northern Mesopotamia the term Syrian ' is equivalent to ' Christian '. It will be noticed that the Christian bodies dealt with on pp. 131- 3 may be divided into three groups: the independent Asiatic Churches (the ' Gregorian ' Church of Armenia, the ' Nestorian ' or East Syrian Church, and the Jacobite or West Syrian Church); (fe) the bodies called Uniate, which, while they are derived from one or other of the independent Churches, are now in communion with the Roman Catholic Church (Armenian Uniates, Chaldaeans, Jacobite Uniates, or Syrian Catholics); (c) a miscellaneous group, including Protestant converts from the independent and Uniate Churches (chiefly Armenian), and secessionists like the New Chaldaeans, and Orthodox Armenians. Origin of the Independent Asiatic — (i) The Church of Armenia derives its name Gregorian from St. Gregory the Illuminator (a. d . 255-326), who brought about the conversion to Christianity of the main part of the Armenian nation, As Armenia was a countryEELIGIONS 129 Nn Wiil, over which the East Roman Empire of Byzantium exercised only tkltni a l oos ® an d intermittent protectorate, it was natural that the limit:; Armenian Church should gradually lose connexion with Byzantine ecclesiastical organization and doctrine; and finally, in the middle of ittujni ^ ie s ^ x th century, when the heretics called Monophysites (who denied unpi ^ ie human element in Christ) were actively proselytizing in Syria kill and Mesopotamia, their doctrine found general acceptance in Armenia. Wpl Gregorian Church is still Monophysite. stiiii Tiie - Easfc s y ri an Church is a remnant of the great body of [lulu, Nestorian Christians who in the Middle Ages were to be found dWi throughout Asia. The ' Eestorian ' doctrine had arisen in the East at Roman Empire during the fifth century, its general position being tie Mi ^ iafc was not one person, but had two distinct natures, a divine and a human. The Nestorians were condemned as heretics at the Council of Ephesus in a . n. 431, and were forced to take refuge beyond the borders of the Roman Empire. In Mesopotamia and Persia their form of Christianity spread with great rapidity. Nestorian missionaries made converts in Malabar, China, and the Mongolian 111 &gt; plains (hence, probably, the mediaeval legend of 'Prester John'). The Arab conquerors on the whole treated the Nestorians with ' ,, toleration, and the Nestorian Church increased and flourished till !, i about year 1400, when Timur Leng (Tamerlane), the Mongol, persecuted it with wholesale massacre. Of the isolated remnants WW' one 0 f th e most considerable was that which lingered in the plains mCtas# 0 f Assyria round Mosul and in the mountains south of Lake Van mfei a nd Urmia. This body of Nestorians was, however, reduced in the W sixteenth century by the adhesion of the majority of the plain- dwelling part of the community to the Church of Rome. The East ®Ir_ Syrian Church, which still maintains its independence, though it iirfi* denies the imputation of being 'Nestorian', is now almost entirely feioBi confined to the mountains. (hi) The West Syrian or Jacobite Church traces its origin to the ieii# work of a certain Jacobus Baradaeus ('James of the horse-cloth so i ( oe ^ called from the appearance of his dress), who in the sixth century CbU' was successful in establishing a large number of Monophysite com- jcotis? munities in Syria and Mesopotamia. In spite of persecution by the jjilb Byzantine Government, this Monophysite Church maintained its ;e tie S existence near the borders of the East Roman Empire, until it was able to enjoy the modified tolerance extended to all Christian sects e (itii b y the Arab conquerors. The Jacobite Church is still Monophysite. jlUiiiiiiii Uniatism. —There are three Uniate Churches in Mesopotamia—the (nistrf Armenian Uniate, the Chaldaean or East Syrian Uniate, and the West .^Syrian or Jacobite Uniate—and these communities have only three mbs. i 1130 RELIGIONS points in common, viz. that they acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the Pope, and that they accept the decrees of the Councils of Ephesus, a. d . 431, and of Chalcedon, a. d . 451, which respectively condemned the heresies of Nestorianism and of Monophysitism. In other matters—ritual, liturgy, ecclesiastical laws and customs each community is independent of the others and ot the Roman Catholic Church ; each has its own separate hierarchy, although the^ Pope exercises some limited power in the appointment of the bishops and patriarchs. Within the Uniate Churches there is apparently a tendency to resent an assertion of Roman authority. Millets. —From time to time the most important of these Christian religious bodies have obtained recognition from the Turkish Govern ment, and have been constituted into millets. Each of these millets has its own civil head, appointed by the Turkish Government; in practice the Turkish Government appoints to this post the spiritual head of the Church. Originally the head of the millet was respon sible for the civil government of his people, collecting taxes from it and administering civil justice. Of late years the administrative functions of the heads of millets have been much reduced. Collection of taxes has been taken over by Turkish, officials, and, though a Patriarch who is respected may still be much appealed to as an arbitrator by his own people. Christians appear recently to have been made liable, at least in most respects, to the Turkish Courts, where law modelled on Occidental models has to a considerable extent replaced in practice the old Mohammedan code. Before the war the Patriarch who wielded most secular authority was Mar Shimum. the hereditary chief of the Nestorian highlanders. But in all Churches the Patriarch has been highly influential in secular matters ; and he has remained primarily responsible to the Govern ment for the political management of his millet. French Dominican Mission in Mosul. —An Italian Dominican mission was established in Mesopotamia in the thirteenth century, and had its head-quarters at Mosul in the sixteenth century. This mission was abandoned in a. d . 1730, and was re-established in 1750 by three Dominicians. This, too, was abandoned in its turn from 1805 to 1840, but from the latter date the Dominicans have continued their mission either at Mosul itself or in its near neighbourhood. At the present time there are a Dominican community and some nuns at Mosul, together with schools for boys and girls, and a printing-press from which religious books are issued in various languages. For the neighbourhood of the town there are a dozen or more schools conducted by this mission. They carry on educational work among the Chaldaeans and other Uniates. The Dominicans of(£l i \&gt; i J# RELIGIONS 231 M^uJ are French, and apparently include a considerable number ot Alsatians. As a result of their work, a fair number of Chaldaean priests can speak Trench. Protestants. These are mostly Armenians, but there are also a few converts from the Chaldaean, Jacobite, and Nestorian Churches. Protestantism is the result of American mission-work, and Oriental Protestants can often speak some English, which they have learnt in American mission schools. On the whole the Oriental Protestants ot Mesopotamia seem to have made an unfavourable impression on travellers; but it must be remembered that the judgements of the latter nave usually been based on superficial observations. nu 0 f^ ce Sects— (a) The Oregorian Church is the national Ohurch ot Armenia, and represents and fosters Armenian national aspirations.^ To it belong the great majority of Armenians in Mesopotamia. Before the present war the total number of its members was perhaps 3-3J millions, of whom nearly 2 millions were in Kussian and Turkish Armenia, and the remainder scattered over the rest of the Russian and Turkish Empires, Persia, India, and other countries. The Church constitutes a millet in the Turkish Empire. Of the four patriarchates the chief is that of Echmiadsin, about 10 miles west of Envan, in Russian territory. The Chief Patriarch was selected by the Tsar from two candidates chosen by the General Assembly of the Church. The Patriarch of Constantinople ranks ' 'J' 0 . C'hief Patriarch. A college education is obligatory on the Gregorian monks, some of whom have the title of Vardapet • irom these bishops are selected. The parish priests, who are allowed to marry, are elected and supported by their congregations. The deacons are also allowed to marry. The General Assembly is com posed of bishops, vardapets, and one layman and one priest from each see. The Gregorian Church is Monophysite and not in com- munion with Rome. '7A^AAA'^ me ^ an ^ n ^ es are _ a much smaller community (perhaps 70,000 in all), and are found in western Kurdistan and in the south eastern corner of Anatolia. As their name implies, they are in communion with Rome. They have an archbishop at Mardln in upper Jezireh and bishops elsewhere. There are some Armenian Umates at Baghdad. The Church is recognized as a millet. (c) Armenian Protestants (perhaps some 45,000 in all; a few thousands in Mesopotamia) are found mostly in the Armenian high- Aimenian Protestantism is the result of the proselytizing work of the American missionaries—mostly Presbyterians. Many Armenian Protestants have been educated at American mission schools and can speak English. It may further be noted that a con- i 2132 RELIGIONS siderable number of leading Armenians belonging to other sects have been educated at the American college—Eoberts College—at Constantinople. ^ ~ ^ ™ ,1 (d) Some Armenians belong to the Greek Orthodox Church, but •they do not appear to be represented in any appreciable numbers in Mesopotamia. . „ , ™ u i (e) The Nestorians or East Syrians (also called Chaldaeans, or by foreigners Assyrians, or by themselves Easterns 01 Syrians) foim a fairly united body in the mountains of central Kurdistan, between Lake Van and Urmia in the north, and Mosul in the south. They are for the most part Syriac-speaking highland tribesmen of the ordinary half-civilized type. (For their history see p. 129.) They constitute a millet in the Turkish Empire, and are an independent Church not in communion with Eome. They themselves dislike bellicalled Nestorians. Their Patriarch (called Mai Shimum) is paramount chief of the tribes into which they are divided. He is elected from the members of a family in which the office is hereditary. Before the war he resided at Kochannes near Julamerk. The parish priest is usually the chief man in his village, and is held in great honour. Priests and deacons are allowed to marry. There are a few monks and nuns. Fasts are long and severe, the chief being the Advent Fast (25 days) and the Lent Fast (50 days), 3 days at the end of the winter, and Fridays. An English mission has been established among the East Syrians for about 30 years (the Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Assyrian Christians). Its efforts have been directed towards education, medical work, and support of the East Syrian Church. (/) The Chaldaeans (East Syrian Uniates, see p. 129) are in com munion with the Roman Catholic Church. Iheir numbeis aie perhaps about 30,000. They are found chiefly in and around Mosul, where their Patriarch resides, though he retains the title of Patriarch of Baghdad and Babylon. A community of Chaldaeans exists at Baghdad. Many of their priests have been educated at the Dominican mission at Mosul and can speak French. (For the occupations of the Chaldaean laity see p. 115.) Most of them speak Arabic, a few Syriac. A body of some 2,000 Chaldaeans seceded in 1869 on the question of Papal Infallibility. It does not seem certain whether this so-called New Chaldaean community still exists. (g) There are a very few converts to Protestantism from the Nestorian and Chaldaean Churches. Most of them live at Mosul. They have been proselytized by American Baptist and Congrega- tionalist missionaries.EELIGrlONS 133 [h]The Jacobites or West Syrians are found in the country in and near Mosul, in the vilayet of Diarbekr, and in the northern part of Syria. There is a Jacobite community at Baghdad. Their Church is independent, professing Monophysite doctrine, and is recognized as a millet. The Patriarch (called Patriarch of Antioch) resides at Mardln, while the Maphrian, or first bishop, has his see at Mosul. The Patriarch is generally chosen by the bishops, though there have been cases of election by lot. Bishops-elect must be monks or widowers. There are three orders of priests—monks, parish priests, and chor-episcopi (the leading priests in large towns). Parish priests must marry before ordination, and may not remarry. As the popular feeling is strongly against unmarried parish priests, a widower, unless he becomes a bishop, usually retires into a monastery. A priest is chosen by a council, composed of the deacons and lay representatives of his congregation. He is usually influential. The order of deacons is large and important. Education is provided by the Church, and most of those who remain in Jacobite schools till the age of fifteen become deacons, but the greater number do not become priests, but are occupied in secular business. Jacobites keep five yearly fasts. (i) Jacobite Uniates are found in Mosul, Diarbekr, and Baghdad, as well as in Syria. They have a bishop at Mosul. Their Patriarch resides at Baghdad. (j) There are a few Protestant converts from the Jacobite Church (mostly Congregationalists and Baptists) who have been proselytized by American missionaries. Yezidis A Shiah theory that the founder of the Yezidi sect was Yazid, the murderer of Husein, is doubtless based on little save a desire to dis credit them in the eyes of Mussulmans. The oldest Yezidi traditions centre round the shrine of Sheikh Adi, their saint and prophet, in the hills 30 miles NNE. of Mosul. The Sheikh appears to have been outwardly a Moslem, but his shrine is built on the site of an old Nestorian church, which may account for some of the Christian elements in their sacred writings. The Yezidis have suffered much persecution, and are still regarded as idolaters beyond the pale. Yezidism has points of resemblance with old Iranian and Assyrian beliefs, as well as with Manichaeism and Nestorianism. Thus they regard the Devil as the creative agent of the Supreme Being, a reinstated fallen angel who is the author of evil. He is never mentioned except as the Peacock King (MaliJc-i-taus). As for their traditions regarding the Deluge, Crea-134 EELIG] ONS tion, and Judgement, they appear to be appropriations from Biblical sources, overlaid with a mass of fable. They regard Christ as an angel in human form, and recognize Mohammed as a prophet with Abraham and the patriarchs. The Yezidis have no central ecclesiastical authority, but a hierarchy of castes and sects, of whom the highest are or princes. Next come the sheikhs, mullahs, qawals (preachers), pirs (who exercise priestly functions); and lastly the and who tend the shrine of Sheikh 'Adi. The ritual practised by the itinerant qatvals is of a highly esoteric nature, having to do with the worship of the Peacock King, and strangers are rigidly excluded. Both baptism and circumcision are custoijuary. Divorce is permitted only upon proof of infidelity. In the matter of fasts they follow Moslem customs. The pilgrimage to Sheikh Adi is an annual affair, accom panied by much ceremonial and festivity: there are lesser shrines, such as those of Mohammed Eesham, Khasia, Sitt Nefisse, and Abdi Eesho, which are also much in favour. The dress of most Yezidis is white, with a short brown cloak. Some of their religious leaders wear black. Sabiaks The Sabians were mentioned in the Koran together with Christians and Jews, and like them entitled, in the view of older Mohammedan theologians, to tolerance as the possessors of a written revelation. The exact nature of their religious beliefs has not been properly determined. Baptism is one of their principal rites, and frequent ceremonial ablution is enjoined ; they are said to venerate Yahya, or John the Baptist, as being a reincarnation of Seth, but consider both Moses and Christ to be false teachers. They place Paradise in the Pole Star. They are an uncircumcised, but not monogamous race. Their ceremonies are said to be conducted in Syriac and closed to strangers. They possess scriptures of their own. Jews In the past Mesopotamia has been a principal centre of Judaism. The captivity of the Jews in Babylon (sixth and fifth centuries b.c.) has its monuments in the reputed tombs of Ezra at 'Ozeir, of Ezekiel at Kifi, and of Daniel at Kirkuk. From the period of the captivity onwards there existed in the country a large Jewish community, which was increased after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Eomans ( a.i &gt;. 70). Under the Sassanids and the earlier Caliphs of Baghdad ( a.d . third-eleventh century) Babylonia was the chief seatRELIGIONS 135 of Jewish theological and legal learning. The (the heads of the Babylonian Jewish universities) gave decisions on questions of Judaic law which were accepted by Jews throughout the worlds On the other hand in the eighth century there arose in Babylonia the schism of the Karaites, who, in opposition to traditional rabbinism, insisted on the letter of the written law. It is said that there are still a few Karaites at Hit. The widespread influence of the Babylonian Jewish teachers was to some extent connected with the political supremacy of the Caliphate, and, as the Caliphate lost its power, that influence declined. With the ruin of Mesopotamian civilization Mesopotamian Judaic culture fell into decay. At the present time the Jews of Mesopotamia (on whom see further p. 116) are said to be strict observers of their law. The tombs of Ezra and Ezekiel are visited by Jewish pilgrims. Qizilbash and Shabbaks The religion of the Qizilbash is obscure. Orthodox Mohammedans regard them as heretics of a very objectionable sort or as atheists. They apparently worship ' Allah, Ali, and Huseinbut they do not observe Eamadan, and it seems that they practise secret rites. It would appear that their religion is a blend of Shiism with pagan, or possibly Christian, elements. The Shabbak religion also seems to be a mixture of Shiism and paganism. if Jul*V I CHAPTER IX ADMINISTRATION Before 1914 Turkish administrative system—Turkish administrative divisions — Local government — Provincial departments — Imperial departments — Da'irat es-Saniyeh—Arabistan—Behbehan. Turkish Administrative System Previous to the beginning of the sixteenth century the Turkish Government was an Oriental despotism, based on force. The Sultan was a feudal War Lord, receiving obedience from a number of feudal sub-chiefs. In 1517 Sultan Selim, the Grim, usurped the Caliphate, or Papacy of Islam, from the Arabs and united the spiritual and temporal power in the person of the Sultan-Caliph of Constantinople. The Ottoman Government thus became a theocracy, deriving its inspira tion from the Koran. At the time of the capture of Constantinople in 1453 the Turkish State already rested on an Islamic basis, and Mohammed the Conqueror decided that the religious and purely internal affairs of the Orthodox Christian communities which had survived the Turkish conquests should be delegated to their respec tive religious heads, the chief of whom was the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople. The Jewish community was similarly dealt with. The Turkish conqueror was too contemptuous of the infidels and their ways to condescend to deal with the affairs of their com munities, which were called millet, really meaning a 4 nation'. The root of this policy was perhaps the incompatibility of Koranic law with Christian jurisprudence, as a Moslem court could not admit the testimony of a Christian witness against a Moslem. The Christians, called rayah, had no real rights and were treated as helots. Until 1839 there were four such non-Moslem millets: the Greek, Armenian, Koman Catholic, and Jewish communities. Subsequently the Bulgarians, Maronites, Nestorians, and Protestants were also recognized. The fact that the Patriarchs and other(70 ADMINISTEATION 137 m-k lects-i tl.o P f - iT ei e h e recognized channels of communication with Forte m all matters affecting their communities gave them a position of considerable influence and prestige. Foreign Christians had an analogous position. In virtue of the Capitulations they were subject in common-law cases to the jurisdiction of their own consuls embassies, but were not allowed to hold real property. From 1453 to the beginning of the nineteenth century the Turkish btate was a loosely jointed structure. The Turk's ideal was to live on his conquests and conquered, and his organization was purelv one adapted to the needs of war against the infidel. Su 1 1 ^ a ^' CaIl P| 1 delegated most of his religious authoritv to the bneikh el-Islam, who appointed the religious functionaries' in the provinces and supervised all matters appertaining to Islam. The Ottoman Sultan similarly transferred a certain meed of his temporal to . . G ™ nd VlZ!er ? through whom all the high officers btate, both in the capital and in the provinces, were nominated, ine Empire was divided into immense provinces called m presided over by a Pasha of Three Tails, e .g. the Pasha of Begade , H i was viceroy of all Turkey in Europe south of the Danube ; the Pasha of Erzevnm ruled all Kurdistan and Armenia ; the Pasha of Baghdad exercised authority over the Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra re|ions ; . t while the Pasha of Damascus controlled all Syria. When Eussia's dW wars for the liberation of 'her Orthodox Christian brethren' from mopU their yoke as rayahs resulted in the shrinkage of the Ottoman ■ rs mpire, the necessity of internal change on the lines of a more closelv gostutiif Knit system was felt. The Janissaries and the feudal chiefs were it te, removed by massacre and a regular army established with a Minister f. VVar - T he eyalets were abolished and replaced by the smaller divisions called vilayets, governed by a vali, with an accountant- 'tM g ener al [defterdar) for finance, a secretary-general repre- losPiirf tentative of the Public Works, Public Instruction, and other ^Ijii departments in the capital. The vali was further assisted by an ( 011 Administrative Council (Idare Mej Each vilayet was divided )nle j # into two or three sanjaqs, administered by a lieutenant-governor ^{nmtessanf) appointed by Imperial decree. The sanjaq had a finance o ; tl f l er (muhassebeji), a secretary [tah and representatives ttiit ot the various ministries, with also an as in a vilayet. ^ |Each sanjaq was subdivided into from three to six teas, each i administered by a sub-governor called appointed bv the -Government, while the kaza was further subdivided into three or iour naMyes presided over by a mudir. In each qarlmh, or village there was a muMitar, or headman. J These and other similar changes were effected during the first half jsleu retn leffi &lt;0 iPn i an138 ADMINISTRATION of the nineteenth century, and were confirmed and amplified by the Hat-i-Himimjun of 1856, after the Crimean War Equal cm, political, and religious rights were promised, if not actually granted, to all the inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire without distinction ot race or creed. A Penal Code, a Commercial Code, a Vilayet Law, and other such modern changes were instituted by Imperial decree, while a regular Ministry of twelve members, inclusive ot the Grand Vjzifrand the Sheikh el-Islam, was formed, and a Council ot State was established. These changes did not materially alter the cnaracter of the Turk or of his administrative methods. Ihey were honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Fresh disorders and massacres of Christians occurred, and the Serbian and Russo-l ui is i wars (1875 -8) ensued. A desperate effort was made to modernize Turkey by introducing representative institutions in lo/b, in the shape of a Senate and Chamber of Deputies with a Ministry respon sible to the Sultan. This system was soon found unworkable and unpalatable to the new Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, who in 18 prorogued Parliament indefinitely and governed through the Palace and Porte for over thirty years. The abuses and disorders continued and culminated in the Macedonian agitation during the first eight years of this century. In Jnly 1908 the Tnrkish army took the situation in hand, forced the ex-Sultan to revive the Constitution of 1876, dethroned him, installed the Young Turk Government m uower with the present Sultan as their nominee and creature, and modified the Constitution by introducing Parliamentarism, or re sponsibility of the Ministry to the Chamber. The Sultan and Senate were shorn of all power, and, as the people were totally lacking in political instinct or education, the Young Turks, who constituted but an infinitesimal minority of the population, found that they could govern only by putting the Chamber of Deputies under the shadow and terrorism of the court martial and the state of siege which they established in the Capital in 1909 and have maintained till the present day. . 1 , All real power was vested in this secret court martial, whose pro ceedings were manipulated by the central office of the irresponsible Committee of Union and Progress. This body established branches in all the provincial centres to control the action of the official focal authorities, i.e. the valis, mutessarifs, kaimmakams, &amp;c. As the central court martial was composed of officers who, either from having studied in Germany or for other reasons, were under German influence, the German Ambassador and his military attache became the real arbiter# of Turkey, and the directors of its central and provincial administration.ADMINISTRATION 139 Ifiil; The German aim was to secure for their representative at Con- talltjt stantinople the position which Lord Cromer built up in Egypt, and tfev in this they had partially succeeded when the Great War broke out. iTimtl f^ ie Young Turks, allured by the prospect of freeing their country . i irom all non-Turkish trammels, proceeded to abolish the Capitula- 'Httions and the rights of the non-Moslem millets, and then, despite the x: written assurances of territorial integrity offered them by Great tt . Britain, Russia, and France, boldly plunged into war by attacking fwdii ^ us,, i a an d Egypt. Since the inauguration of the Young Turk . regime in July 1908, the Ottoman Empire had, up to Maich 1916, lost 1.005 460 square miles of directly or indirectly administered . teiriiory in Europe, Africa, and Asia, there being some 700,000 ;■ square miles (i.e. three times the size of Germany) still remaining. l^. ji^ Turkish Administrative Divisions in Mesopotamia 1 The following table gives a list of administrative sections in the iMjiU vilayets of Diarbekr, Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra, exclusive of nahiyes.

It [the Empire] ran not on the paper ordinances, but on unwritten Is law, unrecorded provisions of Government, habits of command and a of obedience inherited from a remote past and applicable to an f immediate present which was not so very dissimilar from the past; up it was founded, not on the power and efficiency of Vali and Com- mandant, but on the authority of village headman, tribal sheikh, and ik local Seyyid. . . . The power of sheikh or headman was derived II neither from the Sultan nor from the Constitution, nor can it fall with « them. It is deeply rooted in the life of the people, and with wise pi supervision will form for several generations to come the staple of law ■ and order.' Turkish administration was more or less effective in I certain limited areas—chiefly in some of the larger towns ; but even i in many of the towns mujtahids, sheikhs, begs, and aghas were often « more influential than the local officials. Over by far the greater fe part of the country it was not Ottoman jurisdiction that held society til together, but tribal or local custom, administered by sheikhs and a headmen, or the arbitration of holy men (compare pp. 99-100). As for »1 taxation, a large proportion of the population only made irregular and A partial payments extracted from them by force or management; many |t tribes and districts could escape taxation altogether for years on | end. The dealings of the Turkish Government with the Arab and nl Kurdish tribes were a mixture of diplomacy and spasmodic displays m of force which generally had little or no permanent results, and | were as likely to do harm as good. It was neither strong enough nor wise enough to maintain a proper supervision of the sheikhs and aghas, and on the other hand it cherished an ideal of centralization which fed it to interfere with them clumsily and ineffectually. ] Every civil officer from the vali down to the mukhtar was assisted i by a civil administrative council, of which he was president, us composed in part of officials and in part of non-official members who ml were selected by the local government from short lists of names sub- jf mitted by the communities concerned. These councils had only | advisory powers, and met about four times a year. The head-quarter ml towns of sanjaqs and kazas were organized as municipalities, and *] the affairs of each were supposed to be administered by a municipal fc committee. These committees had no more powers than the admini- m /ADMINISTRATION 143 strative councils. Even the municipal committee of so large a city as Baghdad, with at least 140,000 inhabitants, could not of itself expend any sum larger than 200 gold piastres, or thirty-six shillings. There were faults in the system quite apart from the vital questions of the quality and qualification of the administrative personnel for their work. The whole scheme suffered from ovei'-centralization. The valis had no power of appointment over their subordinates. The local councils and committees would, with their limited or rather non-existent powers, have been in Europe, not to speak of the East. A host of spies pervaded the provinces and reported direct to Constantinople. The valis had no concern with, and no power or control over, one-half of the administrative machine, viz. the Departments of Public Justice, of Land Records, Posts and Telegraphs, Religious Endowments, Customs, Public Debt (which was virtually the Excise Department), the Tobacco and Salt Mono polies, Public Instruction, and Sanitary Service. These departments may be termed the ' Imperial' Departments, in contradistinction to the ' Provincial' Departments which were in charge of the valis and which are specified below. The local chiefs of the Imperial Depart ments received their orders direct from, and reported direct to, Constantinople ; though copies of such orders were sometimes sent to the vali for his information, and it was his duty to investigate complaints against the proceedings of any department in his vilayet outside his control. Lastly, in Baghdad no less than one-third of the Ifintjiki whole cultivated area was the private, personal property of the Sultan (as will be explained below), which was managed by the Sultan himself through his private staff. With this area the vali would naturally not think of interfering. To some extent the same ; jisil condition of things obtained in the province of Basra also, where . the Sultan owned a considerable private estate. gtnnjdf. Provincial Departments The vali of each vilayet was the head of the non-Imperial, ^ otherwise the Provincial, Departments, which were : (a) the gendar- , ^ merie, (fc) the civil police, (c) the revenue-collecting establishment r L and department of general accounts. The vali was also the political j representative of the Ottoman Government in his own vilayet, and s# , j, the conduct of all dealings with foreign consular officers or foreign ''f i.j- subjects, and with the semi-independent tribes of the country (Arab to*?! or Kurd), was in his hands. He had no authority over the troops of the regular army in his province, but he could summon the military ^ ^ commander to take such steps as might be necessary for the attain-144 ADMINISTRATION ment of political or administrative ends. Occasionally, for very- special reasons, the same officer might be invested with the highest civil and military authority in the same vilayet, as was the case at Basra in 1906-7 ; but as a rule the late Sultan had far too profound a mistrust of his officers to put much power in their hands. As regards the Provincial Departments, (u) the maintenance of law and order throughout the country in times of peace depended on the force which was officially given its modern name of the gendarmerie, but is more familiar by its time-honoured appellation of mptiehs. Their organization was military, and the force was under the control of a special section of the Turkish War Office; but it was distributed under the orders of the civil authorities as a mili tary police. The zaptiehs were half mounted and half infantry, and were commanded in part by officers seconded from the regular army, and apparently in somewhat larger part by civilians who held special commissions. The strength in each province varied with local conditions ; in Baghdad there were supposed to be about 1,500 mounted and 1,000 unmounted zaptiehs; in Basra &lt;350 cavalry and 400 infantry. As a rule they were scattered up and down the country in small detachments, and, besides their proper duties, were employed on all kinds of miscellaneous work, such as collection of revenue from the tribes, furnishing of garrisons for posts, domestic duties in the establishments ot civil officers, escorts for European travellers, &amp;c., &amp;c. The men are described as not smart in appear ance, but as useful and hardy. Whether the actual corresponded with the nominal strengths of each troop and battalion is doubtful. Their pay was very often in arrears. (&amp;) In the larger centres of population and in places of administra tive importance there existed a purely civil police, whose authority, however, did not extend to the surrounding villages or open country. Its numbers wore small, and, when they required men, the officers of the civil police were entitled to make use of zaptiehs. (c) The tax-collecting and revenue account departments were relatively small in numbers, as the taxes of which they held charge were mostly farmed, but they were lucrative posts. The tent and hut tax was collected, at the rate of Ss. 4cZ. (50 gold piastres) per annum, wherever collection was feasible, from each household of the agricultural population, both settled and^ semi- nomad. Besides this household tax, a cess of lid. (5f piastres) was levied as a contribution towards educational and military ex penditure. These taxes were farmed. The various taxes on domestic animals fell principally on the nomad and semi-nomad tribes, and were farmed to the chiefs. Con-ADMINISTRATION 145 sequently anything like a collection of the full amount was impos sible, especially as all reliable statistics on which to base recovery were absolutely wanting. The chiefs collected what they could squeeze out of their clansmen, but, on the other hand, screened them against the G-overnment. If a tribe was powerful, it practically escaped payment of this tax altogether. The land-taxes, which were farmed, were mostly levied in kind, and gave therefore naturally every opportunity for chicanery, bribery, and evasion. Freehold lands were assessed to pay from one-tenth to one-fitth of the gross produce, according to facility of irrigation ; exceptionally favoured lands paid up to one-third of the gross produce. The rent charged for the use of State or Crown lands (see below) was a matter of arrangement between the department concerned and the tenant, and varied from one-tenth to even one-half of the gross produce. Taxes on date and orange-trees were levied in cash, 8hi. (7 mi/ piastres) per tree on the former and to (2-4 piastres) on the latter. See further on land-taxation pp. 191-3. The 'forests', from which a small revenue was derived, are mostly plantations of poplars and tamarisks on the Euphrates and Tigris. The royalty on minerals varied from 5 to 15 per cent. but was practically confined to the copper mines at Arghana in the vilayet of Diarbekr. In the whole of Irak this tax produced only about £180 a year. Municipal taxation consisted largely of octroi, a lucrative impost for the collectors thereof, which may account for the liberal number of municipalities. All local products paid 7 per cent. ad valorem on entering a town; there were also a number of other taxes on local industries, trades, and handicrafts; and all these imposts,when not evaded,were further enhanced by the method of affixing stamps to receipts given for them, these stamps having to be supplied by the taxpayer, after the method mentioned in connexion with the customs (see p. 147). In connexion with taxation generally it is a significant comment on the system which obtained under the Turks that it has been asserted that in the vilayet of Basra seven-tenths of the people escaped scot-tree of all taxation, and paid nothing whatever, except perhaps in bribes. Imperial Departments psii'; Of the Imperial Departments there wex-e three classes : |( j Dili®: (a) Public Justice. [h)Revenue Departments. (c) Department relating to the convenience of the public, .cbi^ 1 WKS. I KX46 ADMINISTKATION Public Justice. —There were four kinds of Courts : Ecclesiastical Criminal, Civil, and Commercial. Only questions arising under the law of the Koran were cognizable by the Ecclesiastical Courts; the judges were hazis, recognized and paid by Government, one at the head-quarters of each vilayet, saniaq. and kaza. Appeals lay from the lower to the higher kazis, and from the latter to the Sheikh el-Islam at Constantinople. Authorized and officially recognized jurisconsults, or existed at the head-quarters of each vilayet and sanjaq, whose duties were to resolve legal difficulties and give authoritative opinions under the ShcvitC or sacred law, especially in questions connected with inheri tance, marriage, and other family relations. The Civil and Criminal Courts were divided into: Courts of the First Instance, located at the head-quarters of each vilayet, sanjaq, and kaza; High Courts at the head-quarters of each province; and the Supreme Court at Constantinople, which had only appellate juris diction. Each of these thi'ee tribunals had a civil and a criminal side, the judges in each being distinct sets of individuals. The language of the Courts was Turkish. The civil judges were all Mohammedans; in Criminal Courts non-Mohammedans were included in the Bench. The civil code {Mujalli), which dealt with rents, sales, exchange, contract, &amp;c., had been drawn up by Turkish jurists. As the Turks belong to the Hanafi sect of the Sunnis, the law adopted by the compilers of the code was Hanafi law, and thus the Shiahs of Meso potamia, and the members of the other three Sunni sects, had to submit to Hanafi rulings. Crime was divided into three categories: petty, ordinary, and heinous. The Courts were assisted by a Public Prosecutor and his subordinates. Courts of the First Instance disposed of petty crime without appeal, except on a point of law. Before charges of ordinary or heinous crime were tried, the accused went before an Examining Magistrate, who, after investigation, either discharged the accused or committed for trial—in the case of ordinary crime to the Court oi First Instance, in the case of heinous offences to the High Court. In each instance an appeal lay from the Court trying the case to the Court immediately superior to it. No charge against a British sub ject could proceed except in the presence of a British Consul, and no sentence on a British subject was valid until concurred in by a British consular representative; differences of opinion between a Court and a Consul were referred for settlement at Constantinople by the British Ambassador and the Turkish Minister of Justice. Commercial Courts at the head-quarters of vilayets dealt withADMINISTRATION 147 mercantile suits, causes relating to bills of exchange and promissory notes and matters of the kind, subject to appeal to the local High Court on the civil side. The procedure of these Courts is stated to have been based on the Code Napoleon. If a foreign subject was a party to a suit in the Commercial Court, one or two assessors of the same nationalit}' as the toreign subject were added to the Court; the proceedings were watched by a representative of the foreigner's con sulate, and an appeal lay to the Chief Commercial Court at Con stantinople. Imperial Departments of Revenue.—These were the Customs, Public Debt, Tobacco and Salt Monopolies, and Land Records. Customs was one of the most important revenue agencies, pro ducing more in Baghdad and Basra than even the land-taxes. The Department was under a Director-General at Baghdad, who dealt direct with Constantinople, and had a deputy with his establishment at Baghdad and at Basra ; officials of lower rank and clerks were stationed at Khanikin, Qizil Eibat, Mandali, and Bedrah on the Persian frontier, at Nashweh and Kurna on the Shatt el-'Arab, at Suq esh-Shuyukh on the Euphrates, and on the Tigris at Qal'at Salih, Amara, Kut el-Amara, Suweira, and Kazimain. By agree ment with the Powers, the import duties were, in 1907, raised to 11 per cent, ad valorem. The export duty was 1 per cent. and a refund of 10 per cent, ad was permitted on goods exported within six months of importation. Without an agreement with the Powers, these duties were enhanced from time to time by the ingenious device of requiring various stamps of different and varying denominations to be affixed to documents presented to the Customs House. Some of these stamps wex*e ostensibly ear-marked for the cost of the Hejaz Railway, others were simply revenue stamps. In some cases this imposition entailed as much as 50 per cent, additional on the customs duty proper. That the administration of the customs was highly corrupt goes without saying. It is reported that at Basra the export trade evaded taxation altogether. The import duties actually paid are said to have averaged not more than 6 per cent., including duty, bribe, and porterage, instead of 11 per cent. The Department of Public Debt existed for the benefit of the European bondholders of the Ottoman Government, and was subject to international control. It was represented by superintendents at provincial head-quarters, with assistants at all the more important places, and travelling inspectors. The principal sources of revenue made over to the Public Debt for management were fisheries, liquor, salt, silk, and stamps : it was practically an Excise Department, ~ O148 ADMINISTRATION The Tobacco Monopoly was in the hands of a company known briefly as the Regie, which held the lease or farm of the manufacture, collection of duty, and sale of tobacco throughout the Turkish Empire. Its offices were at the head-quarters of the vilayets, with branches at the principal centres of tobacco cultivation. The duty appears to have been Is. 3cZ. per 2^ lb. (7-8 gold piastres per kilo gramme) of superior quality, and Id. (3-9 gold piastres) per the same weight of inferior quality of tobacco. Persian tobacco, which is largely imported for smoking in paid an import duty of 6d per 2| lb. (3 gold piastres per kilogramme). The Land Eecords Department dealt with all lands and buildings, except the Sanlyeh lands, to which reference is made below. The Department, of which the offices were at Baghdad, Mosul, and Diarbekr, was divided into two sections: the first, or Tapu, registered all transactions in, and arrangements relating to, the ownership of land generally, and managed the second class of landed property, viz. the Crown lands. These were mostly let to tenants whose tenure was undisturbed provided they paid the rent or did not discontinue cultivation for more than three years. The second, or Amldk, section of the department dealt with similar matters relating to buildings. Both sections levied fees. (See further on land-tenure Chapter XI, pp. 188-94.) Departments Relating to the Convenien —These were; Posts and Telegraphs, Public Health, Religious Endowments, Public Instruction. The first two of these are dealt with in other chapters. The Department of Religious Endowments was represented by accoun tants at the provincial head-quarters. In the Baghdad province it had much to do in superintending the finances of the great Shiah shrines at Kerbela, Nejef, Kazimain, and Samarra. On education see pp. 119-20. The Da ikat es-Saniyeh The very large private estates {Aradhi Sanlyeh) acquired by Sultan Abdul Hamid were, until 1909, administered by the Dairat es- Sanlyeh, a branch of the Civil List Department. The Sanlyeh lands of Irak were administered by a central committee which sat at Baghdad, and corresponded direct with the Minister of the Civil List at Constantinople. This Committee consisted of two branches, one dealing with lands and irrigation, and the other with the navigation section of the Sanlyeh. Saniyeh lands in the Baghdad and Basra vilayets fell into four groups, according as they relied for irrigation on0 | ADMINISTRATION 149 S* the grates the Shatt el-Gharaf, the Tigris, and the Shatt el-Arab xespe v y. addition to these, there were Sanlyeh lands in the ; - valley^ of the^Diyakh, and even at Khanikin, close to the Persian border. On the Tigris the Sanlyeh had acquired the whole Dujeil canal and the areas watered by it. Below Baghdad the valuable es ates ot bhadi and Bogheileh iu the kaza of 'Aziziyeh were held by v leSaniyeh; also lands along the right bank of the river from Tawll to Umm el-Ajaj, and on the left bank from Samr to Imam Mahdi, in each case up to 20 miles inland from the river. The right bank of the Tigris, together with the country behind it to a depth, it is said, of about 40 miles, from the point where the Shatt el-Gharaf leaves it as far as Sheikh Sa'ad, belonged to the Sanlyeh. From Kumeit to the Bitaireh canal the Sanlyeh estate occupied the right bank and extended inland some 30 miles. On the left bank the Sanlyeh extended almost continuously from Amara to a point opposite Azair, and inland almost to the Hawlzeh marshes. A quantity of land in the Muntefiq sanjaq, irrigated by the Shatt el-Gharaf, was Samyeh. The Sanlyeh properties irrigated by the Euphrates were many and large, above and below Museyib; near Hilla, the Haml- diyeh canal was Sanlyeh pr operty in the Shamiyeh kaza ; and it owned extensive domains on the right bank of the Shatt el-Arab The Sultan also possessed large estates in the neighbourhood of Mosul and in the plains near the lower courses of the Great and Lesser Zab. (See further on tenure on Sanlyeh lands pp. 188-90.) .The navigation branch of the Sanlyeh came into being in 1904 V, [ when it ' acquired' the whole stock and assets of the ' Oman Otto man' branch of the Turkish Ministry of Marine, viz. three river steamers, barges, workshops, a dry dock at Basra, and offices and oftk f warehouses at Baghdad, Kut el-Amara, Amara, and Basra. It is lift on record that less than 10 per cent, of the market value of the office buildings was paid by the Sanlyeh to the State. In 1905 the Sanlyeh bought two more steamers, which were added to its fleet. Its competition with the private companies interested in Tigris navigation was close, and it of course monopolized all Govern- traffic, such as the transport of troops, military stores, &amp;c. ie l# feature of the administration of the Sanlyeh was the fact that on its large executive staff there were a number of military officers i!5: who were borrowed from the State, receiving a departmental allow- ance m addition to their military pay. tsM U V™ been claimed for the Sanlyeh that its policy in managing the Sultan s property was one of enlightened self-interest, which is ■ 3 ver y Probable; its relations with its tenants were generally good, , and its navigation branch endeavoured to give satisfaction to traders J —150 ADMINISTRATION and travellers. It has also been claimed that the intelligent and energetic policy of the Sanlyeh set a good example to landowners, stimulating them to follow the lead of the Sanlyeh in the mannge- ment of their private properties and affairs : this seems less probable, seeing that good, fertile, and well-managed estates were pretty sure, sooner or later, to be acquired by the Sanlyeh. The Young Turks, after dethroning the ex-Sultan Abdul Hamid in 1909, transferred from the Civi] List to the Ministry of Finance all the properties in Mesopotamia which had belonged to the Dairat es-Sanlyeh. The management and revenues were taken over by the State, while a fixed Civil List and stipends were allocated to the Sultan and the Imperial Princes. The ex-Sultan had spent the reve nues of the Sanlyeh on payments to sheikhs in all parts of the world for Pan islamic purposes and on gratifications to State functionaries and others with a view to maintaining and enhancing the prestige of the Sultanate. The Young Turks devoted them mainly to analogous purposes in the interests of their Committee of Union and Progress. Arabistak Southern Arabistan (including Hawlzeh) is under the governorship of the Sheikh of Mohammareh, the head of the Muhaisin Arabs. Theoretically he is the representative of the Persian Government; practically he is independent of Persian control. In northern Arabistan, which has been nominally under the administration of a Persian governor, political power has in tact been divided among tribal chiefs and urban notables. Southern Ardbistan. —On the NE., southern Arabistan includes Shakheh; and its northern boundary thence runs west, just excluding Alwanieh, and striking the Ab-i-Gargar at the El-Haddam nullah, miles above Band-i-Qlr. It leaves the right bank of the Gargar at Khar Eawaishid, 5^ miles N. of Band-i-Qlr, and farther to the west follows the northern and western boundaries of the Anafijeh, East of the Dlz it coincides with the northern boundary of the Hawlzeh district. The Sheikh of Mohammareh is represented by deputy governors at Hawlzeh, Ahwaz, Pellahlyeh, and in the Hindlyan and Jerrahi districts: but these have little power. The Sheikh manages his subjects chiefly through political agents directly under his orders, and through tribal chiefs or headmen appointed by him. The Sheikh's own tribal council—consisting of the headmen of the sec-ADMINISTEATION 151 tions of the Muhaisin—is assembled every month and gives its consent in matters of importance. The present Sheikh, Khazal Khan, K.C.S.L, K.C.I.E., has shown himself a capable ruler. The only part of his dominions where he has had serious trouble in maintaining his authority is the Hawlzeh district. The Sheikh holds very large tracts of southern Arabistan as his private property by grant from the Persian Government, on con dition that he shall not sell or transfer any land to foreigners. On Turkish territory along the Shatt el-Arab are a large number of Muhaisin and Ka'ab Arabs. Before the War these were wholly under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Mohammareh and owed him military service. They paid taxes to the Ottoman Government; but the revenue raised by the Turks from the Sheikh's private estates on their territory (which are inhabited by his tribesmen) has been remitted to him by the British Government. The revenue of the Sheikh's government is derived from taxes and dues, the nature of which varies from district to district. For the most part they are levied either on land or on produce. The Sheikh possesses a large private income from his estates, and uses it for political purposes. The customs of southern Arabistan have been a part of the Imperial Persian Customs, and have been administered accordingly, with the co-operation of the Sheikh. Northern Arabistan. — There has been a Persian governor in northern Arabistan, resident either at Shushtar or at Dizful. Theo retically this Persian official is Govern or-General of the whole of Arabistan, with supervisory powers of the Sheikh of Mohammareh. Actually he has had very limited authority even in the northern province. The chief object of the Persian governors has been described as being 1 to obtain the goodwill of a few powerful indi viduals whose assistance will enable them to collect the revenue and any further sums extorted upon which they can agree'. The revenue 6 consists in the country of taxes on produce, not on land ; and in the townships on industries and shops'. In the cities of Shushtar and Dizful the real power has generally lain in the hands of the mujtdMds (religious leaders). Outside these cities the chiefs of the Bakhtiyari, Sagwand, Beni Lam, Kathlr, and Beni Sa ad have dominated the country. The influence of the Sheikh of Mohammareh reaches as far as Dizful, and there is considerable rivalry in this region between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiyari khans. The Bakhtiyari hold Ramuz and its district at an annual rent.152 ADMINISTRATION Behbehan Behbehan is nominally a sub-governorship in the Governorship- General of Fars. It is now held by the Bakhtiyari chiefs, who own large estates in the province. The tribes of the Kuhgalu high lands, who are supposed to pay tribute to the governors of Behbehan, are hostile to the Bakhtiyari. In 1913 a Bakhtiyari expedition entered the Kuhgalu country to coerce some refractory clans, but proved a failure.* CHAPTER X d^|| IREIGATION OF IEAK Introduction—Irrigation of Irak under the Sassanids and Caliphs—Irrigation in modern times—Sir William Willcocks' scheme. Introduction The rainfall, which is practically restricted to the months November - May, is too slight for the needs of the country (for details of rainfall see Chapter II). It is indeed not without some importance for agriculture. ' During the winter months, as a general rule, the rainfall is a not inconsiderable factor in the success of the crops; and over large areas of Mesopotamia barley is sown and matured in sole dependence on the winter rainfall.' But even in its present under-populated and under-cultivated condition Irak depends on irrigation for by far the larger proportion of the crops raised in it. Perennial irrigation is needed in Irak, and one of the main problems of irrigation is how to maintain a sufficient supply of water when the rivers are low. The flood season, falling in spring, is rather ' too late for the winter, too early for the summer crops(On the rise and fall of the rivers see pp. 24-5.) The general lines of any irrigation-system in Irak must be in part determined by the following relations of its surface levels ; r ^ a \ The Euphrates from Fellujeh to Diwanlyeh is higher than the Tigris between Baghdad and Kut el-Amara, and commands the country between the two rivers. (Ground-levels on the Euphrates : at Fellujeh, 130 ft. above sea-level; at Divvaniyeh. 85 ft. ; on the Tigris: at Baghdad, 105 ft.; at Kut, 79 ft.) (£0 From the left bank of the Euphrates between Fellujeh and Diwanlyeh, and from the right bank of the Tigris between Baghdad and Kut, the ground falls away very gradually, the slopes from the two rivers forming a depression, the lowest line of which, starting from the southern end of Lake 'Aqarquf, runs at a distance of 4-18 miles from the Tigris to a point about W. of Bogheileh. Thence its course bears more to the south, and it is continued by154 IRRIGATION OF IRAK the shallow valley which runs parallel with and west of the Shatt el-Hai from near Kut towards Nasirlyeh. This depression affords facilities for drainage. (c) The Tigris from Kut to Kurna is higher than the Euphrates from the neighbourhood of Nasirlyeh downwards, and commands the country between the two rivers. (Ground-levels on the Tigris: at Kut, 79 ft. ; at Kurna, 13 ft. Ground-levels on the Euphrates: at N^sirlyeh, about 10 ft. ; at Basra, about 8 ft.) (c?) The country on the left bank of the Tigris from the neigh bourhood of Sindiyeh (about 40 miles in a direct line north of Baghdad) down to Kut is commanded by the Diyaleh, and in part by the Tigris. The difficulties of introducing a scientific system of irrigation into Irak are very great. How to secure control of the rivers and put theii waters to profitable use is an extraordinarily complicated problem. The beds of the Tigris and the Euphrates have been spoiled by centuries of neglect and misdirected work on the part of the in habitants. Water has been diverted for irrigation by reckless canal- cutting, which has made it impossible for the rivers to keep their beds properly scoured. Their channels have been damaged besides by the encroachments of cultivators who have reclaimed land along their banks. The result has been that the rivers have become quite incapable of holding their flood-supplies. The flood-water has spilt through breaches in the banks, or through canals ; some of which have been widened and scoured till they have become nearly as large as, or larger than, the original main stream. The great marshes which are formed in the interior by inundation from the riveis aie partly temporary and recurring, and partly, owing to lack of drainage, permanent. One evil has led to another, and the process of the degeneration and disintegration of the rivers has become more and more difficult to check. A local improvement may easily cause disaster elsewhere ; for example, to stop a spill in one place may cause the river to break out in another. Again, the supply of water available is not nearly large enough to satisfy all the demands that might be made on it. This is obvious under present conditions, when so much of the supply runs to waste, when the Arabs have still the most inadequate notions of economy in its use, and when primitive agricultural methods may make the most lavish application of river-water drawn through unregulated canals appear a necessity of cultivation, as, for instance, to the ploughless rice-growing tribes in southern Irak. At present to increase the supply of water for the irrigation of one district may(n) IRRIGATION OF IRAK 155 very easily have the most serious effect on cultivation in another; or the improvement of a navigation channel may threaten with ruin the rice-fields and date-gardens in the neighbourhood. And if the irrigation of Irak is to be developed in the future on a great scale, these difficulties would not disappear with the prevention of wasteful spills. According to the calculations of Sir William Willcocks, the amount of water brought down by the Tigris and Euphrates (as measured in northern Irak at Baghdad, Hit, and the Hindiyeh Barrage) will permit the irrigation of about 7,400,000 acres of wheat, barley, and other winter crops, and in summer of about 990,000 acres of rice, and about 3,100,000 acres of millet, sesame, and cotton. Thus far less than the whole area of cultivable soil in Irak could be adequately supplied from the Euphrates and Tigris. The low-season supply might indeed, in the opinion of Sir William Willcocks, be largely increased by the construction of storage reservoirs in northern Irak which should husband the surplus flood-water of the rivers. At any rate, without such reservoirs developed irrigation from the Tigris and Euphrates upstream of Kut el-Amara and Diwanlyeh would prevent the Shatt el-Arab from receiving any low-supply water and would ruin the Basra date-groves. Moreover, if upper Mesopotamia were extensively irrigated, Irak would feel the conse quences. 'Heavy irrigation works carried out on the upper Euphrates and its tributaries the Belikh and Khabur upstream of Anah . . . would deprive the lower Euphrates of the whole of its low supply ; while similar works carried out on the upper Tigris and its tributaries the two Zabs in the neighbourhood of Mosul would seriously reduce the low supply of the lower Tigris.' Further, the adjustment of the claims of irrigation to those of navigation would continue to present difficulties. Thus, according to Sir William Willcocks, the use of Tigris water for the irrigation of the Shatt el-Gharaf area would make the river below Kut el-Amara un- navigable in the low-water season. It appears indeed that the irrigation of Irak might be carried far enough to make the inland waterways of the country useless except for small-boat traffic. The population of Irak is not large enough to make financially profitable the immediate execution of great irrigation works planned # on a comprehensive scale. The supply of labour seems to be not g much in excess of what is needed by the present cultivated area, and no great increase can be expected from purely Arab immigration. Something may be done to raise the productive power of the in- 5: habitants by the establishment of law and order, the supplying of f greater incentives to industry, the introduction of machinery, and ,jl other improvements in agricultural methods. But in any case for I .J156 IRKIGATION OF IRAK a long time to come the Arabs of Irak will not be able to take advantage of more than a gradual extension of the irrigated area by- means of local works. On the other hand it would appear dangerous to execute schemes for local irrigation which were not based on a careful and compre hensive study of the rivers and of the needs, present and future, of the country as a whole. Local works not planned on the basis of such a study might compromise the interests of other parts of Irak, and even in the end do more harm than good to the district which they were meant to benefit. Irrigation of Irak under the Sassanids and Caliphs The irrigation of Irak seems to have reached its highest point of development under the Sassanids (third, fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries a.d .). 1 Most of the great canal-beds which still exist in various stages of disrepair seem to have been either wholly or in great part the work of the Sassanian Government. Under the Arab Caliphate systematic irrigation was at first fairly well maintained, but with the weakening of the central Government it fell gradually into decay, and it was finally wrecked in the havoc caused by the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century. (a) On the left bank of the Tigris the country from Samarra down to Kut was irrigated by the Nahrawan canal and its branches. The 1 It may be noticed that the Sassanids also carried out great irrigation works in Arabistan. The Sassanian Government seems to have been mainly responsible for the dams on the Kama at Shushtar and Ahwaz. The works at Shushtar have undergone considerable modifications and repairs at different times. There are three great dams here : (i) On the Shatait branch of the Karun a combined bridge and dam known as the Band-i-Mizan or Pul-i-Kaisar. This work, now broken, held up water for the Miyanab canal which waters the Miyanab island between the Gargar and the Shatait branches of the river. (ii) At the head of the Gargar branch a dyke, with a crest about low-water level and six sluices, called the Band-i-Kaisar or Band-i-Shahzadeh. (iii) Half a mile below the Band-i-Kaisar a dam called the Pul-i-Bulaiti rising to above high-water level. The Ab-i-Gargar was apparently cut or enlarged in the Sassanian period. Tradition connects these works with the Koman Emperor Valerian, who was taken prisoner by the Sassanid King Shapur about a. d . 260. It is possible that Roman engineers were employed in their construction. At Ahwaz may be seen the remains of a massive Sassanian weir along the line of one of the shelves of rocks which form the rapids. This weir held up water for canals which are still traceable, and it has been lately proposed to rebuild it.IRRIGATION OF IRAK 157 ■ Nahrawan had several heads on the Tigris and took up the waters '■&lt; of the Adheim and the Diyaleh. Its tail entered the Tigris near EI-Madayyah, in the neighbourhood of the modern Kut el-Amara. In order that a sufficient head of waters might be obtained for the ' flip Nahrawan, the Tigris, at a point between four and five miles below '% the El-Qaim head of the canal, and about ten miles below Samarra, • Mil was turned by an earthen dam to flow over a natural weir of con- Wlni glomerate. It seems that as this weir was gradually undermined Wt attempts were made to keep the Nahrawan supplied by moving its head farther and farther upstream till it reached the neighbour hood of the Hamrln hills. Nevertheless the lower course of the Nahrawan gradually silted up in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Wi centuries. The Nahrawan is still to be traced for the greater part of its P original course, as a broad, high-lying dry channel between lofty ' earthen banks. In parts it has been breached or obliterated. (&amp;) On the right hank of the Ti the alluvial - plain between the river and the desert was watered by the Dujeil and its branches. The Dujeil took off from the Tigris above the ■li conglomerate weir already mentioned. It still carries some water Jljiiii in the flood season as far as Sumeikeh. *•1' (c)Behveen the rivers from the lin — ah out lineDhvamyeh — Kut el-Amara irrigation was maintained through mh a number of great canals which took off from the Euphrates or from nek f what is now the Hilla arm of that river, and tailed into the Tigris or into the present course of the Shatt el-Hai, which in the period liatiiif the Caliphate was the main stream of the Tigris. These canals jjtfE in part carry a certain amount of water, though not nearly so much, nor generally so far, as they did a thousand years ago ; in part they '' are high dry channels enclosed for long stretches between lofty jjjjt- earthen banks ; and in part they have been almost obliterated, iillf* The absence of barrages on the Euphrates above its bifurcation ufcfe must have made it very difficult to keep up perennial irrigation ii.ii on ^ese canals. (The Babylonian engineers seem to have used the Abu Dibis depression as a reservoir, and it appears that another Vi# Babylonian reservoir lay between the rivers near Sippara north of Babylon.) yl r ^ ie country between the rivers was protected against inundation rial,* f rom the Tigris by the embankments of canals drawing their water ^ ' from the Euphrates, e .g. the Nahr Melcha, the high banks of which (((jit are still to be traced for long distances between the neighbourhood Kill# of Ctesiphon and that of Kut. id) Below the neighbourhood of Ku the Tigris had, until158 IRRIGATION OF IRAK the end of the Sassanian age, run approximately on its present course. At the beginning of the seventh century a.d . abnormal floods breached the Tigris dykes, the water spilt south and south west towards the lower Euphrates, and eventually the main stream of the Tigris took to the course of the present Shatt el-Hai. In the time of the Caliphs there was a good deal of irrigation from the Tigris between El-Madayyah (on or near the site of the present Kut el-Amara) and the city of Wasit, about forty miles to the south. Below Wasit the Tigris emptied into the Great Swamp. In the course of the sixteenth century the Tigris returned to its present bed between Kut el-Amara and Kurna. (e) In southern Irak, from below Kufeh to the neighbourhood of Basra, there extended in the Middle Ages a great area of permanent swamp. The marshes at the north-western end of this area (the present Bahr-i-Nejef and Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh) had long been in exis tence, and farther down there had probably always been swamps which Sumerian, Babylonian, or Greek engineers had not been able to reclaim. But before the Arab conquest, and since the Sumerians had begun to build up their civilization here, much of the country had been brought under cultivation by dyking, drainage, and irriga tion. The Great Swamp as it existed in the period of the Caliphate had been formed about the time of the Moslem invasion by the violent diversion of the Tigris which has been described above. The Great Swamp contained patches of rich cultivable soil and maintained valuable fisheries. There was much boat traffic on its channels. (/) In the neighbourhood of Basra the waters of the Great Swamp drained into the Persian Gulf partly by the Shatt el-'Arab, partly by a channel called the Fayd (estuary) of Basra. The Fayd passed west of the city and emptied into the Khor 'Abdallah. The land about Basra was irrigated by a number of canals, which took off from the Shatt el-'Arab and tailed into the Fayd. Irrigation in Modern Times After the Mongol invasion in the middle of the thirteenth century the irrigation-system collapsed. Dykes and dams could not be main tained at adequate strength, and the waters of the rivers passed more and more out of human control, spilling where they should not have spilt, and leaving dry the channels on which cultivation depended. The great canals silted up and could not be properly cleared, or were broken by floods or by diversions of the rivers intoIRRIGATION OF IRAK 159 new beds. No government arose that was capable of devising or working a systematic plan of irrigation. Between 1870 and 1914 the Turkish Government, though it was still a long way from introducing systematic irrigation, attempted some improvements in northern Irak, (a) It had tried to prevent the flooding of Baghdad and its neighbourhood by means of bunds on the Tigris, Diyaleh, and Euphrates, and had actually succeeded in somewhat reducing the inundations in this region. (&amp;) It had pro cured the services of foreign engineers to check the process by which the Hilla branch of the Euphrates was being dried up—a process which seems to have been started by the damming of the Saqlawiyeh canal-head lor the protection of Baghdad. On the Hindiyeh barrages and Hilla Regulator, which were planned to adjust the distribution of Euphrates water between the Hindiyeh and Hilla branches see below, pp. 160-1. (c) The conversion of the Habbaniyeh basin into a reservoir for the storage of Euphrates water had been taken in hand. The escape-canal from Ramadiyeh had been cut, but the outlet through which the water stored was to return from the reservoir to the river had not been made when the present war began, (d) Regulators had been placed at the heads of a few of the large canals taking off from the Euphrates (e. g. the Abu Ghoreib and, apparently, the Mahmudiyeh). But apart from these works in northern Irak, the Turkish Govern ment did practically nothing for the irrigation of the country. The Arabs were left almost wholly to their own devices. The inhabitants of each district looked after their own needs. They kept up the frail and often-broken bunds along the river-banks they made what use they could of the old canal-beds and dug small cuts themselves 1 ; they built dams of earth and brushwood in order to divert water to their fields. They helped themselves to water in the way that seemed easiest, and their unco-ordinated and primitive work was liable to have unforeseen and unfortunate results. They cut num bers of small canals which opened directly on the river-channels, thus promoting the deterioration of the river-beds and preparing the way for ruinous spills. The cultivated land was continually exposed to the risk either of being inundated or of losing its supply of water; and navigation on the rivers was in places seriously affected by Arab irrigation work. 1 Occasionally they undertook the cutting of fairly important canals. Thus in 1911 Sir William Willcocks reported that a canal from Shamiyeh, on the Hindiyeh branch of the Euphrates, which was to connect with the Hilla branch at Diwanlyeh, was being undertaken by the Arabs, and, if successful would be a valuable asset to the country. 'J160 IRRIGATION OF IRAK Irrigation in Irak is carried on by means of water-lifts or oil- motor pumps on the river-banks, of canals, and of earthen dams. Water-lifts are found in Irak along the Euphrates, wherever the banks are fairly firm and high, and in places along the Tigris, especially between Baghdad and Samarra. The water-lift commonly used in Irak is the cherrad, which is worked by horses. The water is raised in leather buckets hung on a rope which passes over a pulley. A large number of centrifugal pumps worked by oil-engines are in use in the country about Baghdad. The oil-motor pump may become an important instrument for the development of the country. Canals of all sizes intersect the country, but serve it very in adequately. In the larger canals that are still more or less in work ing order the flow of water has not been properly regulated ; the arrangements for taking water from them are clumsy and wasteful; in some of them the clearance of silt has not kept pace with the deposit, and little or no water is carried during the low season; others have been so widened and scoured by the rivers that they have caused ruinous diversions of the supply; and, there being no provision for drainage, many of them have created permanent or temporary marshes. Thus the large canals have in part failed to carry the water needed for the development of the country, and in part carried water only to waste it. The rice-fields in the marshes are flooded by means ot earthen dams built in the channels. On the Dighareh canal and probably elsewhere the cultivators build a series of dams, each of which holds up the water till the fields in the neighbourhood have been flooded, and is then broken to let the water pass on to the next dam. Dams of the same type are also built by the Arabs to regulate the supply entering canals ; e. g. the low supply of the Diyaleh is diverted into canals by a dam built across the river every year. The Hindiyeh About six miles below Museyib the Hindiyeh Barrage bifurcates into two great branches, the Hindiyeh and the Hilla, which meet again two or three miles above Samaweh. It appears that from early times some such division of the Euphrates has existed, the main volume of the river having passed at some periods down the western branch, at others down the eastern. Some forty years ago the Hilla branch carried by far the greater supply, and was known as the ' Euphrates', while the Hindiyeh was only a ' canalThen the head of the Hindiyeh widened (partly as a consequence of theIEEIGATION OF IRAK 161 closing of the Saqlawiyeh) until this branch took the larger portion of the Euphrates water. This process continued until the Hilla branch was left dry in the low season, and the land in its neigh bourhood, one of the most productive areas in the country, was threatened with ruin. A French engineer was employed by the Turkish Government to devise a remedy. He constructed a weir at the head of the Hindiyeh, about f mile below the site of the present 4 New Barrage But this weir (the ' Old Barrage') burst in 1903 and failed to check the drying of the Hilla branch, though it has continued to be an obstacle to navigation. Sir William Willcocks was commissioned in 1909 to design another barrage, and the work was carried out by the firm of Sir John Jackson, Ltd. The New Barrage, completed in 1913, lies about 8 miles below Museyib. The old head of the Hilla branch, situated about 600 yards farther down, has been blocked by an earthen dam, and a new head, with a regulator, has been made about ^ mile above the barrage. The Old Hindiyeh Barrage is a weir of stone rubble which in 1914 had a narrow breach near the centre and another near the left bank. On its character as an obstacle to navigation see p. 283. It had been intended that the Old Barrage should be removed when the new had been completed, but its demolition was prevented by the local Arabs. The New Hindiyeh Barrage was built wholly on the left bank of the Euphrates, which was then diverted to its present bed, across which the barrage lies. The old bed of the river was blocked by an earthen dam which is situated at the west end of the barrage. The length of the barrage is 275 yds. It is provided with 36 gates, each 164 ft. (5 metres) wide and fitted with regulating shutters. On the east side is a lock, 26-24 ft. (8 metres) wide, 180 ft. long, and spanned by a lift bridge. When the barrage is fully open it can pass about 4,000 cubic metres of water per second. The Hilla Begulator is 140 ft, long and contains six openings, each 9-84 ft. (3 metres) wide and fitted with regulating shutters. It has a capacity of about 150 cubic metres per second. When the New Barrage was constructed the Hilla branch was cleared of silt as far as Hilla town, and the larger canals in the neighbourhood were also cleaned out. The Hdbhdniyeh ,,, The work needed to convert the Habbaniyeh basin into an escape and storage reservoir had not been completed at the outbreak of the jji; 1 present war. An escape-canal, about 6i miles (10 km.) long and ieIlCt (|l 56 yds. (50 metres) wide, had been cut between the Euphrates mes. i l \m162 IKEIGATION OF IRAK immediately below Eamadiyeh and the Habbaniyeh Lake, but no water had been let into this channel, as the outlet from the basin had not yet been made. It was intended to cut an outlet canal about 4 miles long, from the NE. of the lake to the Euphrates about 4 miles above Saqlawiyeh. The area and capacity of the Habbaniyeh depression are as follows: Below 40 metres (131^ ft.) above sea-level, 146 sq. km. (56 sq. m.): 164,600,000 cubic metres (5,808,495,000 cubic ft.). Below 43 metres (141 ft.) above sea-level, 257 sq. km. (99 sq. m.): 598,500,000 cubic metres (21,133,035,000 cubic ft.). Below 46 metres (151 ft.) above sea-level, 341 sq. km. (132 sq. m.): 1,477,500,000 cubic metres (52,170,525,000 cubic ft.). See further on the Habbaniyeh and Abu Dibis basins pp. 163-4. Sir William Willcocks' Scheme for the Irrigation of Irak 1 With regard to the following summary of Sir William Willcocks' proposals, it may be noticed that his scheme, in the form in which it was put forward in 1911 (see pp. 165-8 below), has recently been criti cized. It has been argued : (a)that the scheme is on an imprac ticably large scale in view of the size of the population of Irak; (b) that it is based on an insufficient study of the rivers and the country; (c) that the advisability of restoring, if possible, the drainage of southern Irak has not been taken into account; that the claims of navigation have not been given their proper weight. Proposed Works for the Prevention Storage With a view to obtaining adequate control of the river-water in Irak, Sir William Willcocks has proposed the construction of bar rages and escapes at the heads of the river-deltas. The effect of such works would be: to relieve the rivers of their excess flood-water at the points where they enter the alluvial plains which lie below their high flood-levels, and thus to ensure these plains against inundation ; (6) to enable large quantities of the flood-supply of the rivers to be stored in reservoirs, so that it might 1 See Sir William Willcocks' Irrigation oj Mesopotamia (1st edition, 1905; 2nd edition, containing much new matter, 1911), and two articles by the same author in the Near East for Sept. 29 and Oct. 6, 1916.IRRIGATION OF IRAK 163 poirtpp^lM-').'™ 88 ' 011 dUri ° g the ,OW SeaSOn ( oom P are tMs The amount of water which it would be possible to store in reser- voirs near the heads of the river-deltas is estimated at 18 milliards of eiibic metres. Much would be lost by evaporation, but it is elieved that 12 milliards of cubic metres would be available for irrigation purposes. Nevertheless, in case different parts of the river-basins were administered by different governments, and if irrigation works on a large scale were carried out in upper Mesopotamia or in the basins of the upper Euphrates and Tigris, it might be necessary for the administration which controlled the Irak system to have an agree- Iw if ^ ft distribution of water with the authorities who controlled the supply higher up. l ^ £ ' S f at t l j William Willcocks suggested a point below Felluieh near Rnt^riqffi fi. aS a suitable site for a barrage. But in 1916, as the result of further study of the river-bed in this neighbourhood, he expressed a preference for a point near the head of the Saqlawiyeh canal upstream of Fellujeh ; there is here an out- c i 0 P of limestone m the bed of the Euphrates which would give a solid foundation. The Habbaniyeh escape-canal would take off 7n 19n X W e ir arra ^ a i? d int0 the Habb aniyeh depression. 1911 Sir William Willcocks did not contemplate as part of his immediate programme the storage of Euphrates water, being con cerned only with the prevention of excessive floods. He intended therefore for the present to use the Habbaniyeh and Abu Dibis depressions (which were to be connected by a cut) merelv as escaues though he looked forward to their eventual use as reservoirs. Subse quently it appeared that the Habbaniyeh basin was probably large al6X0688 flood - water the Euphrates, afd AKnu-u- as a reservoir ^ the connecting cut to the Abu Dibis basin was given up, and, as has already been said (p. 159) it was decided to make an outlet from the north-east end of Habbamyeh to the Euphrates above Saqlawiyeh Proposed Barrage and Escape at Delta.-Sir Wiiham Willcocks has proposed a main and a subsidiary barrage on e Tigris 10 miles below Samarra and just below the head of the Dujeil canal. He did not include an escape for the Tigris in his programme of 1911, as the expense of such a work would have long remained beyond the means of the Turkish Government. Instead he suggested a partial insurance against Tigris floods in a scheme noticed below. But m 1916 he pointed out that in the desert164 IKEIGATION OF IRAK west of the Tigris there is a trough which starts from the neighbourhood of the river near Istablat, ahout 6 miles below Samarra, and runs SW. to the large depression into which the 'Wadi Tartar drains; and along this trough an escape-canal might be carried, though at a considerable cost If the Tartar depression, which has not yet been surveyed, should prove sufficiently large, a reservoir might be established here, which could support the irrigation of the country between the rivers from Baghdad to JBabylon. If the depression is not large enough to store all the excess flood- water of the Tigris, the escape could be carried on to the Euphrates reservoir in the Habbaniyeh basin, with which would then be con nected, for the purpose of storing the additional water fiom the Tigris, the neighbouring depression of Abu Dibis. Sir William Willcocks calculates the cost of a Tigris escape to Habbaniyeh and of the reservoirs in connexion with it at £22,000,000. If the Tartar depression should prove large enough to take the whole of the water from the Tigris, the cost would fall, he considers, to £12,000,000. But it would seem difficult to calculate what would be the cost of such works in the new conditions which will have been created by the war. Other Proposals for Dealing with Tigr —In 1911 Sir William Willcocks proposed that until an escape for the excess waters of the Tigris could be constructed at the head of the delta, the following measures should be adopted : that the inundations from the Tigris at Baghdad should be reduced by an escape at Mo'adhdham, which would allow the flood-waters to spill into the depression east of Baghdad, whence they would return to the river by an outlet below the city ; that the right bank of the Tigris above Baghdad should be secured by an embankment from about opposite Mansuriyeh to Kazimain; and that downstream of Baghdad towards Kut el-Amara the country between the rivers (which was to be irrigated from the Euphrates) should be protected by an embankment consisting of the spoil of the 'right Tigris canal' (for which see below, p. 166), while the floods were to be allowed to spill over the left bank. When Sir William Willcocks wrote there were frequent spills from the Tigris bend south of Ctesiphon. He proposed to make a cut across the neck of the bend in order to induce the river to silt up its former channel, and then, having allowed time for a gradual increase of water in the Tigris below this point, to carry the right Tigris canal across the bend so as to close it altogether. The cut across the neck of this loop was subsequently dug by the Turks in 1915.IRRIGATION OF IRAK 165 Treatment of Selected Area Since the scheme of irrigation put forward by Sir William Will- cocks in 1911 did not take storage into account, the total area to be commanded by the works then proposed is only about 1,410,000 hectares (3,480,000 acres). (a) The country between Fellujeh and Baghdad on the north and Kufeh and Kut el-Amara on the south was to be irrigated from the Euphrates as follows: (i) The necessary head of water was to be obtained by means of a barrage near Fellujeh (but see above, p. 163), as well as by the Hindiyeh Barrage. (ii) The Saqlawiyeh canal was to be restored and used as the feeder of a canal-system along the right bank of the Tigris. The Saqlawiyeh was to discharge into Lake 'Aqarquf, from the southern end of which the ' right Tigris canal' was to start. This latter canal was to be carried at first to the Tigris bend south of Ctesiphon (see p. 164), and was later to be prolonged to Kut el-Amara. (iii) A canal along the left bank of the Euphrates from above the New Barrage to the head of the Iskanderiyeh was to feed a number of large canals (the Abu Ghoreib, Ridhwaniyeh, upper Melcha, Latifiyeh) which were to run westwards to the depression between the Tigris and Euphrates. This depression was to serve as a drain. (iv) The Kutha canal, taking off SSE. from the Latifiyeh, was to water the interior of the country between the upper part of the Hilla branch and the Tigris towards the Shaft en-Nil. From the Kutha a western branch (the Babylon canal) was to run towards Hilla. (v) The country along the Hindiyeh branch of the Euphrates was to be irrigated by canals taking off from above the Hindiyeh Barrage and carried along the right and left banks of the branch to beyond Hindiyeh town (Tawarlj). 'Downstream of Tawarlj, at the bifurcation of the Shamiyeh and Kufeh branches, barrages will be needed in future, but the Hindiyeh branch is itself under going such great changes that the time is not yet ripe for undertaking them.' The area commanded by these works is 650,000 hectares (1,605,500 acres), including 100,000 hectares commanded by the extension of the ' right Tigris canal' beyond the Ctesiphon bend. The estimated cost 1 of the irrigation works under pre-war conditions (the estimates 1 In calculating the cost of these projects. Sir William Willcocks added one- third to the cost obtained from quantities and rates for ' contingencies, estab lishment, tools and plant, and accommodation'. The total thus'obtained was166 IERIGATION OF IKAK for the Habbaniyeh escape and Hindiyeh Barrage being omitted) was &lt;£T5,347,130 (£4,812,417), of which £T1,006,760 (£906,084) would go to the prolongation of the 1 right Tigris canal' from the Ctesiphon bend to Kut. The total cost of agricultural works was estimated at £T6,500,000 (£5,850,000). (b) The country along the Shatt el-Hai would be irrigated from the Tigris. The Shatt el-Hai would be restored and its supply increased by a barrage on the Tigris at Kut el-Amara. The area commanded here was to be 250,000 hectares (617,500 acres). The cost of the irrigation works was estimated at £T2,757,980 (£2,482,182); that of the agricultural works at £T2,500,000 (£2,250,000). (c) In the Basra district the alluvial land west and south of the city was to be irrigated from the Euphrates as follows: The water in the Euphrates Jchor between Gurmat c Ali and Suq esh-Shuyukh would be held up in the low season by a barrage at Gurmat 'Ali. In order to prevent the increased amount of water behind the barrage from spreading over so wide an area that its evaporation would nullify the effect of the barrage, the Euphrates water would be cut off from the Hammar Lake and the old channel by a dam at Suq esh-Shuyukh, and its water would all pass down to Gurmat 'Ali, being confined on the north by a bank running from Suq esh-Shuyukh to Kurna. Thus the Hammar Lake and the old channel would be fed with Tigris water only, while the Euphrates water would be concentrated in the present Ichor of the new channel, and when held up by the Gurmat 'Ali barrage would not be able to spread north into the Tigris marshes. It would be carried to the Basra plain by a canal passing between Basra and Zobeir. The area to be commanded is 90,000 hectares (222,300 acres). Estimated pre-war cost of irrigation works, £T1,996,960 (£1,797,264); of agricultural works, £T900,000 (£810,000). An estimate was also made for the reclamation of 50,000 hectares (123,500 acres) of land in the Euphrates marshes: for irrigation works, £T425,000 (£382,500); for agricultural works, £T250,000 ( £225,000). (The land between Basra and Zobeir used to be flooded mainly from the Euphrates Jchor on the north, and also partly from the Shatt el-'Arab below Basra. In 1915-16 bunds were built from doubled to allow for interest on the money spent during the execution of these works and their subsequent development. The result thus reached is called by Sir William Willcocks the ' true ' or ' actual' cost. It is this ' actual' cost that has been quoted here and in subsequent paragraphs.I IRRIGATION OF IRAK 167 Magil to the Shaaibeh ridge north-west of Zobeir, and from the Zobeir Gate of Basra to the high ground near Zobeir town. These bunds have held up the inundations from north and south, but it seems that the consequent increase of water in the Shatt el-Arab has done some damage among the date-gardens on the river-bank.) (d) The country between Beled and Baghdad on the right bank ot the Tigris was to be watered from the Tigris through the restored Dujeil, which was to be kept supplied by means of barrages on the river immediately below the head of the canal (see above, p. 163). Large canals branching from the Dujeil were to supply the alluvial lands east and west of it. The area commanded by these works was to be 170,000 hectares (419,000 acres). The estimated pr e-war cost of the irrigation works was JT2,118,240 (£1,906,416); that of the agricultural works was ill &lt;£T1,700,000 (£1,580,000). (e) The country along the lower course of the Nahrawan, east of of the Diyaleh, was to be irrigated, for winter crops only, by Diyaleh water carried in the Nahrawan. At present the lower Diyaleh feeds the Khalis system on its right bank, and the Khorasan, Mahrut, and Beled Ruz canals on its left bank. Good masonry regulators at the heads of these canals are needed, as well as regulators for the escapes back into the Diyaleh. The existing canals appropriate the whole supply of the Diyaleh in the low-water season, but at other times they leave in the river enough water to irrigate a considerable area on which winter crops could be grown. Sir William Willcocks has proposed to turn this available water into the lower course of the NahrawS-n between Abu Sifweh and Kut el-Amara. He indicates three possible ways of doing this: (i) By a masonry barrage at Abu Sifweh ; but this barrage would be strained very severely to maintain the level of the water needed for the canal (ii) By the construction of a canal taking off from the Diyaleh under the Jebel Hamrln and carried thence to the lower Nahrawan. (iii) By the diversion of the main stream of the Diyaleh in the neighbourhood of the Jebel Hamrln to a line passing east of the Beled Ruz canal and down the Khor el-Merj and the Khor Suweikiyeh to the Tigris east of Kut. Part of the Diyaleh waters would then be allowed to pass down the old bed of the river to Abu Sifweh, and could there be turned into the Nahrawan by an earthen dam. The total area to be commanded along the lower Nahrawan is 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres). The cost of the irrigation works involved in scheme (iii) under pre-war conditions was put at168 IRRIGATION OF IRAK £T1,817,120 (£1,635,408), and the cost of the agricultural works at £T2,000,000 (£1,800,000). (/) On the Tigris below Kut el-Amara the only works proposed were those considered necessary for the preservation of the naviga bility of the river in the marshes below Amara. The plans include the placing of weirs at the heads of the larger canals in the marshes. The question how to safeguard the navigation channel in the marshes is at present under consideration (see p. 281). TOWCHAPTER XI AGRICULTUKE AND LAND TENURE Introduction—Principal cultivated areas—Soil—Methods of cultivation — Principal crops—Domestic animals—Land tenure and taxation of agri culture : the land question in Irak. Introduction In the recent past the wealth of Mesopotamia has consisted almost wholly in agricultural produce and in flocks and herds; and upon its agriculture and stock-raising the future fortunes of the country will chiefly depend. The natural fertility of the soil in the alluvial plains of Irak and Arabistan, and in large areas of upper Mesopotamia^ promises an immense increase in the productive ness of these lands if they should be well governed, well irrigated, and adequately populated. The staple products of the country are dates, rice, barley and wheat, wool and goats' hair, hides and skins. Date-cultivation is practically confined to Irak and southern Arabistan, and it is in the marshy and easily flooded lands of the south that most of the rice is grown. The cultivation of cotton in Irak, insignificant in the past, may become very important in the future. In the plains of Irak and Arabistan agriculture depends mainly on irrigation, although the amount of rainfall has much to do with the success or failure of the winter crops, which include wheat and barley. In upper Mesopotamia wheat and barley are generally dependent on rainfall alone ; but there is a certain amount of irrigation for rice, cotton, and other crops. In Irak, owing to the need of irrigation, the principal cultivated areas consist of belts of land adjoining rivers, canals, or marshes; the most prosperous districts are those in which it has been found easiest to get the river-w T ater on to the land. In upper Mesopotamia the most important areas of cultivation lie in the plains, but not far from the hills, in regions where the soil is good and the rainfall plentiful enough for wheat and barley, and the streams which descend from the highlands can be used for growing cotton and rice or watering orchards.170 AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE Only a very small proportion of the cultivable area of Mesopotamia is at present under tillage. For a considerable extension of agricul ture in the country there would be needed : (a) the establishment of law and order; (b) scientific irrigation ; (c) the improvement of com munications and means of transport; the establishment of a good financial regime, and the regulation of land tenure so as to remove existing agrarian trouble; [e) the introduction of agricultural machinery and the improvement in other ways of agricultural methods; (/) an increase of population. (а) The Turkish Government has failed to enforce the peace in its Mesopotamian provinces. Among the Arabs tribal fighting and the blood-feud have absorbed much of the cultivators' energies, and in some parts of the country the Fellahin have suffered from black mailing Bedawis. In the north fertile districts have been kept unproductive by the lawlessness of the Kurds and especially by their harrying of the non-Moslem population. So too in Arabistan agri culture was partially paralysed, notably in the Dizful plain. (б) It is obvious that Mesopotamia needs scientific irrigation under Government control. The uncoordinated and crude irrigation work of the Arab tribes has been not only inadequate, but in some ways positively harmful. It must lie with the Government of the country to construct and maintain scientifically planned irrigation works, to organize the distribution of water, to prevent excessive flooding, and to reclaim areas now rendered useless by the disintegration of the lower Euphrates and Tigris. (See Chapter X.) (c) In Irak, where transport has been mainly by river, the condition of the waterways has been such as seriously to hamper the carriage of agricultural produce ; thus wheat and barley grown in the Euphrates districts, having been harvested in May, might have to wait until the following spring to be brought downstream to Basra, owing to the difficulties of navigation in the low-water season. From the Mosul— Erbil region, the most important wheat-growing country in upper Mesopotamia, grain was brought down the Tigris to Baghdad by rafts [JceleJcs). Before the war pack-animals were almost the only means of transporting produce by land. Bullock-carts seem to have been used only locally in a few districts in the northern part of our area. {d) Under Turkish rule there have been inequalities in the assess ment and payment of the taxes on agriculture. A considerable part of the agricultural population has paid its taxes irregularly or not at all. Those who could be coerced were made to pay, and the interests of the country as a whole suffered accordingly. Moreover it seems that part of the revenue was wasted for the benefit of individuals either at Constantinople or in Mesopotamia.AGEICULTUEE AND LAND TENUEE 171 On some estates cultivators have been suffering from the extortions of owners or State tenants. Elsewhere landlords whose titles have been acquired by purchase from the Turkish Government have been unable to collect their rents from the tribesmen who claim the land as their own. (See further on this subject pp. 193- 4.) {e) At present the Arab's methods of cultivation ate primitive and wasteful. But he is intelligent, and it is probable that with assistance, instruction, and control he would improve, and would be able to make use of modern implements and machinery. He has been accused of indolence; but it appears that, if he can feel that he is working for himself, and can see that the amount of his profit will depend on his industry, he can work hard enough. (/*) The number of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia is very far below what is needed for the exploitation of the cultivable soil. The supply of labour for the land will increase, but it cannot be expected that in the near future the increase will be great. Nomads may settle down, and semi-nomads take to a more thorough tilling of the soil. The cessation of tribal warfare may release sheikhs' retainers for the fields. Women's labour may be employed more regularly. Meanwhile with better political, economic, and hygienic conditions the birth-rate would rise and the death-rate decline. On the whole it seems that the population of the country should be able, with the assistance of labour-saving machinery, to take advantage of a gradual extension of the cultivable area by means of irrigation. Principal Cultivated Areas The principal areas of cultivation are the following: (a) In Irak 1 : (i) The banks of the Shatt el-Arab, which form one of the chief date-producing areas of the world. (ii) The neighbourhood of the lower Euphrates about Nasirlyeh and Suq esh-Shuyukh. In this low-lying marshy region, where the river water is widely distributed, the most important crop is rice. Millet, maize, and on the higher lands barley and wheat, are also grown. (iii) The Amara district, including the lands along the Jehaleh (Chahala), Michrlyeh, and Majarr el-Keblr canals. Here # barley and wheat are grown on the higher ground near the river, rice and millet on the lower slopes towards the 1 Before the war only about 5 per cent, of the cultivable area in Irak bore crop.172 AGrKICULTURE AND LAND TENURE marshes into which the canals drain. Eice and barley appear to be the most important crops. (iv) The Hai district. Barley and wheat are grown along the Shatt el-Hai. (v) The neighbourhood of the Hindiyeh and Hilla branches of the. Euphrates from Museyib as far down as the Bahr-i- Sbinafiyeh on the Hindiyeh arm, and the neighbourhood of Diwaniyeh on the Hilla. This is an immensely fertile region with a comparatively large agricultural population. Conditions here are specially favourable to the increase of production in the immediate future by the organization and extension of irrigation. The principal crops are wheat and barley, rice on the lands to which abundant water can be brought, and dates. (vi) The Baghdad—Baqubeh district. The alluvial plain NNE. of Baghdad, watered by the Khalis canal from the Diyaleh, produces chiefly wheat and barley some rice and cotton are raised in summer ; dates are grown along the Tigris near Baghdad. (b) In Arabistan and Behbehan: (i) The Persian bank of the Shatt el-Arab, producing chiefly dates. (ii) The Fellahlyeh district (watered by the Jerrahi): dates, rice, barley, and wheat. (iii) The Hawlzeh district, west of the Karun river, and includ ing the marshes of the Karkeh : rice and dates. (iv) The Ahwaz district, from the Karun eastwards towards the Jerrahi, produces wheat and barley in years of favourable rainfall. (v) The Dizful—Shushtar region. This area, and especially the Dizful plain, has great agricultural possibilities. Wheat is the staple crop ; a good deal of rice is also grown. (yi) The Eamuz plain produces wheat, barley, and rice. (vii) The Behbehan plain: wheat, barley, and rice. (c) In Upper Mesopotamia : (i) The region of the Zabs. This is the most important agricul tural area in upper Mesopotamia. It includes the plains between the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Mosul* and the lower course of the Great Zab, the Erbil plain between the Great and the Lesser Zab, and a chain of cultivated areas extending along the foot of the Kurdish hills from Erbil toAGEICULTUKE AND LAND TENURE 173 Tuz Khurmatli. Wheal and barley are here the staple crops. (ii) The plains at the southern foot of the Tur Abdin. Here the most highly cultivated land seems to be that watered by the Jaghjagh river in the neighbourhood of Nisibin. Wheat, barley, and rice are the principal crops produced. (iii) The plains beneath the southern spurs of the Qarajeh Dagh highlands including the districts of Urfeh, Harran, and Seruj. Moderately productive areas in Upper Mesopotamia are : (i) Parts of the middle Euphrates valley, especially the Deir ez- Zor—Meyyadln stretch, the Anah district, and the Hadlseh —Eluz district. (ii) The Beled Sinjar—Tel A'far region at the foot of the Jebel Sinjar and its outliers. (iii) The Diarbekr basin, with a south-western extension between the Euphrates and the north-west and west side of the Qarajeh Dagh highlands, including the Severek district. Soil The alluvial soil of the plains of Irak is mainly an argillaceous, calcareous loam, homogeneous in character, and of great potential fertility. It is friable and porous, and to a great extent free from sterilizing salts, although these occur in uncultivated areas that are liable to flood and lack adequate drainage. The presence of a large amount of lime in the soil, in some cases as much as 14 per cent, and averaging 12 per cent., makes it easy to work but less retentive of moisture than it would otherwise have been. Samples of soil from the Tigris and Euphrates districts have been analysed, and the result shows the presence of a considerable quantity of fine sand ; this should be an advantage where salt is present and washing is necessar3 r . The principal salt which occurs is sodium chloride (common salt). Carbonate of soda is not present, and the cleansing of the land should not be difficult where the supply of water is adequate and drainage can be arranged. In the salt lands the average percentage of soluble salts is 5*28, which is enough to prevent the growth of vegetation. In the samples of soil ana lysed an adequate supply of the essentials of plant food has been found. The percentage of nitrogen, averaging 0-12 per cent., is equal to that of the soils of Egypt ; for soil not under cultivation or vegetation the percentage is high. The nitrogen probably occurs in174 AGEICULTUEE AND LAND TENUKE forms which are not readily available, but cultivation would be likely to alter this. Potash is present in more than average quantity, and averages 04-0-6 per cent. ; this is more than enough to meet the requirements of any ordinary crop. Phosphoric acid is found also in sufficient quantity (0-2 per cent.) to permit the growth of all ordinary crops without the application of special manures. Possibly cotton might be benefited by the addition of phosphate, but this can be determined only by experiment, and depends to a great extent on local conditions. Information as to the soils of Arabistan and upper Mesopotamia is very slight and vague. The soil of the alluvial lands of Arabistan, especially along the lower Karun and in the Dizful plain, is believed to be of great fertility. In upper Mesopotamia a large part of the northern Jezlreh has a good soil, e.g. in the Seruj district (a heavy red earth), in the Urfeh—Harran plain (a red loam), and in the Khabur basin round Nisibin (a red-brown loam and humus). In the plains east of the middle Tigris (between Mosul and the Great Zab, between the Great and the Lesser Zab, and in a strip of country along the foot of the hills from Altun Kopru to the Diyaleh) there is a fertile argillaceous loam. Strips of alluvial soil occur along the troughs of the Tigris, Khabur Belikh, and other rivers. Methods op Cultivation Methods of cultivation have so far been primitive, and have in many ways tended to keep down production. No trouble has been taken to clean and select seed. The preparation of the land for wheat and barley has been very slight; in Irak one light ploughing has been thought enough. The ploughs in use have been wooden. Manuring has not been practised, the dung being used for fuel. Threshing has been done generally by cattle or buffaloes which tread out the corn, but near the towns a native threshing machine of Mosul manufacture has sometimes been used. Arrangements for storing crops have been inadequate. Grain has been put on the maiket in a very dirty state. There has been no method in use of preserving fodder crops such as hay. The introduction of machinery for ploughing, reaping, and thresh ing is an urgent need of the country. Fuel might be supplied by oil from Arabistan or perhaps eventually from Turkish Mesopotamia. Keaping machines have already been procured for Irak. It has already been noticed (p. 169) that agriculture is more closely dependent on irrigation in Irak than in upper Mesopotamia. TheAGrRICULTUEE AND LAND TENURE 175 means of irrigation in Irak are water-lifts oil-pumps, canals, and dams (on these see further p. 160). Along the river- channels the ground slopes downwards away from the banks. Distributing canals descend these slopes and in many instances tail into marshes. The higher part of the slope, nearest the main channel, being the driest is most likely to be suited for the cultiva tion of barley and wheat. The lower slopes, being more easily watered, may be used for rice-fields. Millet may be raised on intermediate levels between the winter crops and the rice. Changes in the location or the character of cultivation may be caused from time to time by changes in the distribution of the water-supply. Land that at one time produced rice may now, owing to a drop in the water-levels, yield only wheat and barley, or vice versa; or cultivation may have to be given up altogether, the water that formerly supplied the land being diverted elsewhere. The dispro portion between the area of cultivable soil and the area actually cultivated makes it easy to break new ground. It is said that the policy of the Dairat es-Sanlyeh was to. acquire the most easily worked canals and to push each as far as it would go, never irrigating the same land a second time until the canal had been carried to its greatest possible length. The Arab cultivator is wasteful in the use of water, and his crude methods of obtaining it are partly responsible for the present disiutegration of the rivers. (See p. 154.) In upper Mesopotamia irrigation is employed chiefly in the cultivation of rice, cotton, maize, millet, and fruits. In parts of the middle Tigris and middle Euphrates valleys water is lifted by cherrads (see p. 160). Where the water has to be raised to a consider able height naurs are used. These are large water-wheels, built out into a stream on dams and lifting the water by means of buckets. 1 It is said that in the Mosul neighbourhood water-wheels are some times placed in wells. The damming of streams for irrigation is a common practice ; the water held up by the dam is either allowed to flood the neighbouring fields or diverted, into runnels [karezes). In some parts of the country, and notably in the Erbil—Kirkuk region, such runnels may be carried underground {qanats, sometimes also called harezes). Canal irrigation is used in Arabistan. In the Eellahlyeh district there is an elaborate canal system supplied by the waters of the Jerrahi. In the northern province underground channels are found. On the Karim irrigation was formerly maintained by means of great dams at Shushtar and Ahwaz (see p. 156, foot-note). 1 Similar wheels are used to drive flour-mills.176 AGrRICULTUEE AND LAND TENUEE Principal Crops There are two harvests in Mesopotamia—the spring and the autumn {saifi). The crops harvested in spring ('spring' or ' winter ' crops) include wheat, barley, beans, and (a kitid of oats); they are sown between October and March and are harvested for the most part in April or May. Crops harvested in autumn (' autumn ' or 1 summer' crops) are dates, rice, maize millet (dukhn), lentils {mash), kidney pea sesame, cotton, and tobacco. The summer field crops are sown in April, May, or June and are harvested in August, September, or October. Field Crops (a) Winter Wheat and hurley are by far the most important of the winter crops. In Irak and Arabistan they are grown principally on the higher and drier lands that are capable of irrigation, but they are affected by the quantity of the rainfall and are even sometimes raised on unirrigated land. In upper Mesopotamia they are usually dependent on rainfall alone. It appears that in Irak considerably more barley than wheat is grown. Among the chief areas in Irak producing these grains appear to be: (i) The lands watered from the Euphrates between the Saqlawiyeh canal and the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh. Here Hilla has been the centre of the grain trade. On the Hindiyeh branch of the Euphrates much land formerly under rice has now come under wheat and barley. (ii) The lands along the Euphrates between Samaweh and Suq esh-Shuyukh. (iii) The neighbourhood of the Shatt el-Hai (the Shatt el-Gharaf). (iv) The land between the Diyaleh and Tigris watered by the Khalis canal. (v) The Amara district. In Arabistan wheat and barley are grown on the drier cultivated lands throughout the country. Ahwaz is the centre of the grain trade. Wheat is the staple product of the Dizftil plain. In upper Mesopotamia the principal corn-growing area is in the plains east and south-east of Mosul in the neighbourhood of the Zabs. It appears that in this region there is more wheat than barley. The vilayet of Diarbekr (which includes besides the Diarbekr basin the districts of Nisibin and Mardln) produces enough wheat and barley to export to Mosul and Baghdad when there is a shortageAGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 177 in these provinces. It seems that a good deal of wheat and barley is also grown in the Seruj and Urfeh—Harran districts. Wheat and barley are generally sown either in September and October or between November and the end of January, i.e. either before or after the first cold days of winter. In some districts it is usual to wait for the first autumn rains before sowing. The earlier sowing [Mrfi) seems to produce crops which thrive better, and, as they ripen in good time, are more likely to escape the attacks of locusts than those raised from the later sowing {(itl/li). Barley sown in September in the Hilla district is high enough to afford fodder for cattle in November, and after being eaten down once springs again with greater vigour. In the Basra vilayet one reason for late sowing is that tribes which grow wheat and barley frequently migrate in autumn to the rice-lands in order to help in the harvest there, so that their own lands are neglected till the end of December or January. The land is only lightly ploughed, and the upturned soil is not exposed to the sun for any length of time. After the sowing a cross ploughing covers the seed. The harvest begins in April. The corn is threshed after being dried in the sun. Usually it is trod 11 en out by buffaloes or cows. The grain often suffers from careless storage and insufficient protection against the weather. The amounts of wheat and barley produced in Mesopotamia have varied greatly according to the amount of rainfall, the river-levels (abnormally high winter floods may do much damage to these crops), and political conditions. Mesopotamian wheat is of a hard red kind. There are white and black varieties of barley, the white being in demand for export, the black consumed locally, chiefly as fodder for horses. (See further on the qualities of these grains pp. 215-16.) Experiments are being made in Irak with Indian wheat and barley. Beans are planted in Irak at the end of September and are harvested at the beginning of April; green beans, however, appear on the market about the middle of February. The beans raised are of various kinds, among them the broad, French, and haricot varieties. Hurtumdn. described as ' a sort ot oats ',is sown in Irak in January and reaped about the end of May. (b) Summer Itice, The cultivation of rice is of great and growing importance in Irak. The rice-lands are those which can be most abundantly supplied with water. The most important areas of rice- production in Irak are: MES. I m178 AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE (а) In the south : in the marsh-lands of the lower Euphrates, especially in the neighbourhood of Suq esh-Shuyukh, and on the lands watered from the Tigris and its distributaries near and below Amara. (б) In the west: in the lower and moister parts of the country along the Hindiyeh and Hilla branches of the Euphrates. On the Shatt el-Hindiyeh a recent drop in the water-levels has caused the conversion of large areas of rice-land into wheat and barley fields. On the Shatt el-Hilla rice is grown along the Dighareh canal and about the Khor el-Afej. In Arabistan rice is grown in the Fellahlyeh and Hawlzeh districts and in the Dizful plain. In the plains of upper Mesopotamia there is rice-cultivation in districts at the fpot of the hills where streams from the highlands provide an abundant water-supply, as at Nisibin. Rice is raised also in some upland plains and valleys where the drainage from the surrounding hills collects. In Irak rice is generally sown broadcast on the silt deposited by the falling floods. Some at least of the rice-growing tribes of southern Irak do not use ploughs and therefore have been dependent on the lavish inundation of their fields by water heavily laden with silt. In southern Irak, on the lands watered from the lower Tigris, there are three kinds of rice, differing according to the method of cultiva tion. These are (i) Mrfi : this is early broadcast rice, sown in May on the higher middle ground levels below the wheat and barley, and ripening at the end of August; (ii) athli : this is late broadcast rice, sown in June on the lower middle lands below Mrfi and ripening about the middle of October; it needs watering until September at least; (iii) shittal : this is accounted the best rice for eating; it is raised almost entirely from immature plants of the Mrfi and atlili transplanted with the falling of the floods to lower levels which have been covered with some depth of water for upwards of three months; it does not mature until November. In western Irak there is a red rice which is sown at the end of February and reaped in July, while a white rice is sown in May and June and reaped towards the end of September. SMttal is little grown in the Hilla region. ' The size of the rice crop in Irak is much subject to fluctuations, owing to its dependence on the height of the river-levels during the flood season, which vary from year to year. Heavy crops of rice are harvested, but the quality is as a rule coarse. 1 Rice straw, called buh, is used as fodder for cattle. 1 According to one authority the rice that is put on to the Baghdad market includes four principal kinds— nakkazeh and 'amharhu, the best varieties, of whichc AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 179 Maize is grown both in upper and in lower Mesopotamia and in Nli, Arabistan. In Irak it is sown in March and harvested in September. Millet is^ an important crop both in upper and in lower Mesopo- ttntttj. ^ ami ' a an d is raised in some parts of Arabistan. In Irak it may be fe, ||! grown on the intermediate levels between the winter cereals and rice, or on lower ground, in the marshes, left dry when the floods iajld, c o n ti' ac t, or again by the banks of the rivers where the floods reach . . high enough to soak the earth and recede early enough to admit of sowing. It is used as food for cattle and poultry and is mixed with ■. wheat to make bread. Lentils. —In Irak the variety of lentil known as is raised in ^ . , the better-watered districts; it appears that a damp, sandy soil is ,, preferred for this crop. There are two varieties—a green and a black. . .vij Doth sorts are sown at the end of June ; the green ripens at the end .. ■ of September, the black at the beginning of November. The Arabs mix mash with rice to make soup. A certain amount is exported to India. The lentil proper {adas) of Irak is said to be inferior. Lentils ; are also grown in upper Mesopotamia. Kidney peas {lubiyeh) are sown in June and harvested in October, or sold green in June and July. There are two varieties of dry I f.. luUyeh—Si red and a white—of which the red is the cheaper. sow lk.1 Fruits and r 1 , Bates have hitherto formed the most valuable item among the 'Vj, exports of Mesopotamia. The banks of the Shatt el-Arab are one ' ' of the principal date-producing areas of the world. Among date- : growing districts of secondary importance in Irak are the following : *P along the lower Euphrates from Kurna to El-Medineh, and in the ■ neighbourhood of Suq esh-Shuyukh ; in western Irak, round Hilla, Kufeh, Kerbela, and Shifatheh; on the Tigris about Daghdad. In • 5 - : ; southern Arabistan dates are grown chiefly on the Persian bank ^ of the lower Shatt el-Arab and in the Eellahiyeh district. In northern Arabistan dates are mentioned among the products of the : 1 Ramuz plain, but are said not to flourish in the neighbourhood of Dizful. In the southern part of upper_Mesopotamia there are date gardens at a few places, notably at Anah ; but the date-palm is found only sporadically in the northern plains of the Jezlreh and is cliiii' 11 -' absent from the hills. The date-palm needs irrigation, and one of the advantages of the the second is peculiarly scented and in favour with Indians and Persians- ushimhah, the commonest kind; and huwaisawi, a cheap reddish rice consumed bv ^'' •^the poorer classes. ptiS' M 2180 AGEICULTUEE AND LAND TENURE Shatt el-Arab district lies in the ease with which the plantations are watered by the rise of the tide. The river-water reaches them through creeks from which are cut side-channels intersecting the gardens. The tree is raised from offshoots, which, where water is plentiful and the soil good, develop rapidly and bear fruit within four or five years. Early in April the blossom of the female palm, which is the fruit-bearing tree, is fertilized by hand. The Arabs climb the trees to insert a sprig of the pollen-bearing male blossom in the sheath which contains the female flowers. About one month after fertiliza tion the fruit forms ; it is partially ripe in August, and is sold in the bazaars as food, but is not yet fit for preservation. In September the fruit is fully ripe, and the clusters are then carefully cut off. When required for local consumption the dates are spread on the ground and left to dry for about a month. For export they are sold damp to the date-brokers. A considerable importation of labour takes place at the time of the date harvest; compounds are established in the largest date gardens, and here the dates are packed by the Arabs for export. The date crop is liable to suffer from the effects of frost in winter and from excessive heat or drought, and from hot winds in the summer which may cause the fruit to fall before it is matured. Many varieties of dates are grown in Irak ; of these hhadrawis, sairs,se/ulis. and deris are exported. and Ichadrawis are the best. (See further on the date trade pp. 214-15.) The date-palm and its fruit are put to a number of uses in Irak. The ripe fruit is one of the principal articles of food in the country, while the windfalls are collected and are used either as human food or as cattle-fodder. Araq is distilled from dates. The branches of the date-palm are used for fuel and as material for furniture- making, building, and fencing. The trunks are used for foot-bridges | as well as in house-building. The fruit-stalks are made up into brooms, the fibre into rope, and the leaves into matting. Other Fruits. —In Irak common fruits are melons, water-melons, pomegranates, oranges (in the northern part of the country), sweet and sour limes, apricots, quinces, and grapes ; almonds, figs, citrons, apples, nectarines, peaches, and plums are also grown. The mul berry is cultivated in the Baqubeh district in connexion with the silk industry. In Arabistan pomegranates, figs, and grapes are widely dis tributed ; limes, oranges, citrons, quinces, apples, pears, apricots, plums, peaches, mulberries, water-melons, musk-melons, and almonds are grown in various places. Oranges are said to do well in the Dizful plain.AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 181 T 111 upper Mesopotamia the vine is common in the hill-country.

Other fruits more or less widely distributed are pome- iiilontij: S rana tes, melons, water-melons, oranges, apricots, mulberries, mkidii a mou ' P eac hes, plums, figs, apples, pears, and cherrifes.

It is reported that the potato has been intro- ; : duced in the Mosul vilayet.

In upper Mesopo- ^^tamia it is grown at Anah and Nisibin, and in the Urfeh—Harran ji,tl(I*P lam &gt; and al so in a number of districts in the vilayet of Mosul. It is cultivated in northern Arabistan, e. g. in the Dizful plain.AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE Two indigenous varieties of cotton are reported to be found in the Baghdad market—Iraki and Mukharesh, of which the latter (cultivated round Khanikin and Mandali) is said to be the better. Both kinds are short-fibred. On the Tigris, near Baghdad, and at Anah an Indian cotton (Hindi), better than the Iraki, is raised. The cotton grown in the Hilla district is favourably reported on. | Mesopotamian cotton is used locally for manufacturing coarse cloth, stuffing mattresses, &amp;c. It is possible that Irak may in the future become an important cotton-producing country. Climate and soil are considered to be favourable to the cultivation of the plant. Experiments with im ported varieties of seed are at present being made. Tobacco is grown in many parts of upper Mesopotamia and in some districts of northern and western Irak (Diyaleh region, Kerbela, Nejef, and Hilla); also in northern Arabistan. Sowings begin in March, and the tobacco is gathered about the end of August. The manufacture and sale of tobacco in Turkey was a monopoly of the Jlegie cointeressee desTabacs VEmpire a joint- stock company, which was practically a branch of the Public Debt Department. Sesame is found in Irak and Arabistan and in upper Mesopotamia. It is a summer crop. In Irak it is generally grown on land that has been inundated by river-water and left dry by the falling flood. On the Shaft el-Arab it is found along the creeks taking off from the river. It is mostly pressed for oil, which is used for cooking and lighting, but sometimes it is roasted for food or used in the manu facture of sweetmeats. Flax is cultivated for linseed in the vilayet of Diarbekr, and also on Persian territory in the Dizful plain and in Kirmanshah. Lucerne is grown for fodder in some districts of Irak and Arabistan. Poppies are cultivated for opium in the Dizful and Shushtar districts of northern Arabistan and in the province of Kirmanshah. The crop is apparently collected about May or June. Indigo is grown in the Dizful plain and in the Kirmanshah province. Pepper is grown in the Shushtar district. Domestic Animals Camels. —These are used for riding and for pack -transport in the Mesopotamian plains (see further p. 278). The riding-camel (dhelul) is almost always a female; the burden camel is usually a male. The life of camels may extend to 40 or 50mmmm AGRICULTUKE AND LAND TENUKE years ; they are trained to carry loads from the third year, but are not reckoned fit for work till the sixth ; and though in regions where they are well treated, as in Nejd, they may work when about 25 years old, they ai'e commonly worn out before reaching half that age. The great virtue of the species is patience. Though resenting the process of being laden, when once started camels will go on until they fall so utterly exhausted that it may be necessary to destroy them : it is cheaper to buy three camels than to bring round one which is exhausted. If well treated they do not bite or kick. The driver makes the laden beast kneel by uttering a guttural cry like ikh—kh— M /; if that fails, he strikes the animal on the neck with his hand ; if there is still resistance, he draws it down by the beard. If a camel is unruly the Arab controls it by laying hold of the cartilage of its nose, whereupon it at once becomes amenable. The trot is the dromedary's easiest pace ; the walk, if long continued, has been described as back-breaking for the inexperienced. After rain, upon loamy or slippery soil, camels are useless, slipping so badly that a halt must be made till the ground is dry. The Bedawi's camel picks up its food where it can, living on the roughest grazing, browsing on thorny acacia and tamarisk, and finding no small part of its sustenance in the or saline bush, which is to camels as flesh meat is to man. When special effort is required or grazing insufficient food is carried. The great Hajj camels do not browse but are fed, as in Syria, on balls of boiled pulse, with addition of knot-grass forage (tfmrm). The Ageyl usually carry a mixture of millet and coarse flour called alej, which they make up every night into balls the size of a man's fist, giving five or six to each of their camels. In southern Nejd the Arabs roll dates into balls, stones and all, and those are reputed to be beneficial as medicine. When the spring pasture begins the camels increase in vigour and put on fiesh. At this season they will go more than two months without drinking, the moisture in the succulent fresh plants sufficing for their needs. In winter they pass a full week waterless without discomfort; in summer they must usually drink at intervals of three days, though a good dromedary, carrying only a rider, will subsist without water for two days longer. The largest and most powerful Arabian camels are those bred by the Anazeh ; the fastest come from central Arabia and Oman, though the breed of the country behind Aden is locally renowned for speed. The pure-blooded camel does not flourish at a great distance from its native region. The Turks have used thoroughbred Arabian dromedaries for carrying dispatches in Mesopotamia and the Syrian J184 agrkiculture and land tenure Desert; but it is said that north of the 30th parallel they soon deteriorate and cannot maintain their former speed. Central Ara bian camels are generally grey or white ; in the north a dun colour is preferred ; black is supposed to indicate an uncertain temper. A well-bred dromedary will perform great feats of endurance. Leachman states that mail-carriers between Damascus and Baghdad have ridden 60 miles a day for nine days in succession. Camels are bred by the nomad and semi-nomad tribes. The great est breeders among all the Bedawis are the Anazeh of the Syrian Desert (the Fed'an and Amarat about the Euphrates valley, the Sba on the Deir—Damascus road, the Euweileh on the Syrian border). The Anazeh may own some 300,000 head, and their camels are reputed the largest and strongest in all Arabia. The Mesopotamian Shammar own perhaps some 10,000 head. Some of the nomads and semi-nomads of Irak breed camels, but very few of them are ex ported ; among the best are those of the Beni Lam. There is scarcely any camel-breeding in Arabistan. Horses. — Horses are bred for riding by Arabs and Kurds, the former preferring mares for this purpose. The Arab attaches great importance to the pedigree of the finer breed of horses, and the descent of such animals is preserved by tradition ; celebrated horses are valued at a high price and in many instances they are not purchasable. Good breeds of Arab horses are raised in the Hilla and Diwaniyeh districts of the Euphrates, on the Tigris by^the Beni Lam, in the Jezlreh by the Shammar, in the Syrian Desert by the Anazeh and in the neighbourhood of Diarbekr. The Mesopotamian breeds have a good reputation, but are inferior to the best of Nejd and Syria. Horses over short distances will outstrip and overtake the fastest riding-camels ; for purposes of general transport in the desert, how ever, their value is negligible, as they suffer from thirst and cannot take the coarse grazing which contents the camel. Horses are chiefly valued by the Arabs for purposes of war; their ability to cover a wide space of ground in a short time makes them specially valuable for this. To ride a horse is a sign of importance among the Arabs, and for a sheikh's horse the difficulty of providing water is sometimes overcome by taking a foster camel, on the milk of which, when other sources fail, the horse can live. The Bedawi rides either bare-backed or on a pad with a slender girth, guiding his horse with a halter only. The bit is not used in the desert, and hoofs are left unshod. In Mesopotamia a native shoe is used which covers nearly the whole of the frog of the hoof, and only a small oval aperture is left in the centre. The result seems to be that animals are frequently(3^) \ »- r | | f t# AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 185 lamed by pebbles which become wedged in the hoof through the hole in the shoe. The Kurdish breed of horses is raised in the hill country of Kur distan, and in the districts round Diarbekr and Mosul. Arab blood, in some cases mixed with Turkoman, Persian, and other strains, forms the basis of the horse stock seen among the Kurds. These horses, together with others of inferior Arab strains, are mostly used for transport purposes and for working water-lifts. Mules. The mules used in Mesopotamia are bred chiefly in south western or western Persia, and to some extent also by Kurdish tribes on Turkish territory. They are employed as pack-animals (mostly in the hills) and to draw vehicles. In the Diarbekr vilayet and the neighbourhood of Kirkuk they are used in agricultural work. (On the mule as a transport animal see p. 279.) There are important mule-markets at Dizful and Shushtar. The mules there procurable are on the whole good, though they are commonly underfed and overworked. Mules in Mesopotamia are worked from the age of 3 or even 2^- years, and do not live long; it is rare to see a mule over 14 years old. They should therefore be bought at ages of from 3 to 8 years; those of three years are the best. They may be roughly divided into four classes: [а] The Arab mule, bred from Arab mares and donkeys in the deserts south of the Persian mountains. This is a useful pack- animal, with good girth and bone and short back ; there are prac tically no draught animals in this class. (б) The Persian mule, bred from Persian mares and donkeys north of the mountains, and usually known as the Isfahan mule. Ihis class is the best to be procured in large numbers ; it includes draught and pack-animals in about equal proportions. The mules are brought across the passes as soon as the routes are clear of snow, and can be purchased in normal years at Dizful and Shushtar from about the middle of March onwards; Shushtar would probably yield three times as many of this class as Dizful. If carrying rates from Ahwaz and Shushtar to Isfahan are high, owing to the late opening of routes and the accumulation of goods for transit, muleteers will not sell their animals readily. Ahwaz is useless as a purchasing centre, as muleteers arriving there can always arrange contracts for return journeys. Isfahan is the best purchasing centre for mules, and animals should be obtainable there at all times, except during the ploughing and reaping seasons, December and Januarv, April and May. ^ (c) The Bakhtiyari mule is bred from cross-bred mares of poor type, usually half Arab, and inferior donkeys. This mule is a small186 AGKICULTURE AND LAND TENUEE and inferior pack-animal, though it usually has good bone, and animals of this type are procurable at all seasons at Dizful and in lesser numbers at Shushtar. [cl) The Pusht-i-Kuh mules, commonly so called, are big-boned animals of fine type which are brought unbroken and wild to Dizful from the north-west by their Sagwand Lur and Kurdish breeders. They are sold to Dizful muleteers at ages from 1 to 3 years, and are prematurely broken down by overwork. These mules frequently stand 14-2 'and 14-3 hands, and an animal of about 16 hands has been seen. Good arrangements for sale and purchase of these mules exist at Dizful and Shushtar, though in 1916 a local boycott by certain sects caused difficulties which would not arise in normal years. In upper Mesopotamia Mosul, Kirkuk, and Diarbekr seem to be important mule-markets. The mule breeding ot Mesopotamia is unimportant compared with that of Persia. The animals sold in the market at Kirkuk are probably mainly bred by the tribes of Persian Kurdistan and the Kirmanshah provinces. There is a cer tain amount of mule-breeding in the Diarbekr vilayet, in the neigh bourhood of Mardln and of JezIret-ibn-'Omar, and in and round the Diarbekr basin. Donlteys. —The ordinary pack-donkey is a small and wiry animal, black or brown in colour. Large numbers of these are owned by the Arab tribes in the plains of Irak and are used lor carrying water and other loads; there are considerable numbers also in the Diarbekr vilayet. Large white or silver-coloured riding-donkeys which com mand a high price are also bred in Irak in the districts round Baghdad, Hilla, and Samaweh. Donkeys of this class are in much request all over the Ottoman Empire. Sheep. —A large part of the pastoral wealth of Mesopotamia consists in huge flocks of sheep, which range far over the plains in the spring when there is good pasturage to be found, and in dry seasons collect by the rivers, and in the well-watered areas near the hills. Sheep- rearing is one of the principal occupations of the nomad and semi- nomad Arab tribes. It is the custom of some tribes to let the rams remain permanently with their flocks, with the result that the ewes may bear lambs twice in the course of the year. Breeds of sheep in Mesopotamia are not clearly defined in the available information. They may, however, be roughly classified according to their wool into three groups, (a) The breed is reared on the plains, characteristics of the wool being a crinkly fleece of comparatively line fibre and bright appearance. This wool is used for making blankets and other coarse woollen textures.AGKICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 187 di and is exported chiefly to Great Britain and the Continent. The numbers of this breed have decreased considerably during periods of drought and inclement weather. (b) The breed is found chiefly on the Kurdish hills north and west of Mosul, round Kirkuk, and on the Persian border. The Karadi sheep are fatter and of a stronger con stitution than the Arab variety ; the wool has a long coarse and hairy staple of shiny appearance; it is used for weaving carpets and other heavy textures. Large quantities of this wool are sent to America and Europe, (c) The Awassi breed takes its name from a tribe of nomad Arabs named Aweiz, who frequent the plains between Mosul and Aleppo. It is probably a cross between the Arabi and the Karadi breeds which may have occurred accidentally by hill sheep mixing with those of the Arab variety at the time when the nomad flock- masters take up their summer quarters at the foot of the hills which border the northern end of the Mesopotamian plains. In Awassi wool the characteristics of both Arabi and Karadi wool may be found. Its staple is coarser than Arabi but finer than Karadi. In recent years the Arab characteristics are said to predominate, making it difficult to distinguish an Awassi fleece from one of Arab wool. The demand for this class of wool has increased considerably in Europe and America for the making of coarse yarns. Eat-tailed Caramanian sheep are found in upper Mesopotamia. (On the export trade in sheep and wool and on the tanning and export of sheepskins see pp. 223-4, 218-22, 228.) Goats. —The Kurds of upper Mesopotamia own very large herds of goats. It is reported that in the Mosul vilayet there are three breeds— the Syrian, the Angora, and the Kurdish—of which the last two have long silky hair. Mohair is clipped from Angora goats and probably from cross-breed animals as well. It is exported, as also are goat skins, raw or tanned (see pp. 220-1). In Irak, where goats are much less numerous than in the north, their principal use is to provide goats' hair from which the black tents of the nomads and semi-nomads are made. Cattle. —Cattle-breeding is on the whole of less importance than sheep-breeding in the plains or goat-breeding in the hills. There are, however, in the plains of Mesopotamia considerable herds of cattle owned by the settled or semi-settled Arab tribes in the neigh bourhood of the Tigris and Euphrates. The nomad Arabs are not cattle-breeders and regard cattle-owning as typical of the fellahin,whom they despise. In Irak the herds of the Beni Lam are said to be the largest and finest. In the north some of the nomad Kurdish tribes, as well as the settled agricultural population, possess cattle. As to breeds of cattle, there is very little information available.188 AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE According to one authority tlii' og 1)ro* 1 !Is ;U'G found in. IrRk - Jicsldki, Iraki, and JenuU—oi which the last-named is the finest. In the Mosul vilayet a large and a small breed are distinguished, besides humped oxen. These last are fairly common in the Euphrates valley. Cattle are used for agriculture and transport. The cows are said to be generally poor milkers and to remain in milk only for about three months. Cow-hides are tanned and exported, and there is some export of cattle to Syria and Egypt. Buffaloes are most common in the marshes of southern Irak. Here 'the Ma dan (A1 Bu Mohammed) own very large buffalo herds with which they roam over the country. In the daytime during the hot weather the marsh-buffaloes remain completely submerged in water, except for their muzzles and their long horns; at night they are herded together by the Arabs who light fires in order to keep off stinging insects. In winter the animals are kept in sheds warmed by fires of rice-straw or reeds. The butter made from the milk of buffaloes is inferior to that made from cows' milk, which it is some times used to adulterate. The marsh-buffaloes are not employed in agriculture. Buffaloes are also found in upper Mesopotamia (where they are used for agricultural and transport work) and in the damper parts of Arabistan. Land Tenure and Taxation op Agriculture : The Land Question in Irak Land Under the law of the Turkish Empire, land is divided into the following classes: (a) MulJc: freehold property. There are four sub-classes of mulJc in two of which the land reverts to the State on failure of heirs. The tapu tenure in Irak (see p. 190) approximates closely to [h] Miri: owned by the State and leased to individuals. The tenant of miri land holds a deed [sanad) recognizing his possession. [Sanlyeh lands, though now the property of the State, differ from miri lands in their history and their management. They are the estates which were acquired by Sultan Abdul Hamid as his private property, and they were transferred to the State after Abdul Hamid's deposition in 1909. They are managed by a special department.) (c) Waqf: mortmain land which has been assigned to the endowment of religious and charitable purposes. Moslem Turkey either is managed by the Department for Religious Endowments or is in the hands of an individual or family representing the institution($&gt;) AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 189 which it benefits. The mortmain lands of the Christian sects are administered by their respective Churches. (d!) MatruJceh: lands left unoccupied for the benefit either of the general public or of the inhabitants of a particular locality. (e) Mawat : waste lands which have been left uninhabited and uncultivated from time immemorial. (Questions touching the inheritance of lands or concerning Moslem waqf are dealt with under the religious law of Islam isheria).) The whole question of landownership and land tenure in Meso potamia is much complicated by varying local and tribal custom and by the conflict between such custom and Turkish legal theory. The view of the land question taken by the Ottoman Government was strongly influenced by the doctrine that the soil of Mesopotamia had become the property of the State by right of conquest. Of the land thus originally acquired by the State, part had since become tvaqf, part had been purchased or converted to his private use by Abdul Hamid and thus become and part had been sold to individuals under conditions of escheat in case of failure of heirs (the so-called estates). There remained a large proportion of the cultivated soil which, being regarded as State domain, was treated as miri and let out on lease. Tenure, however, was not regulated simply by the Turkish law of land, but was further complicated by a heterogeneous mass of local customs, which were still maintained and had to be recognized in the Turkish courts. By far the greater part of the cultivable land in Mesopotamia is tribal territory. This applies to Irak, with the exception of the country round Baghdad, the Shaft el-'Arab districts near Basra, and the neighbourhood of some other towns; it applies also to a great part of upper Mesopotamia. So far as was possible the Turkish Government avoided formal recognition of tribal rights to land. In Irak large areas occupied by Arab tribes were either miri or sanlyeh ; when these tribes were powerful the Government had in practice to allow the local sheikhs to occupy the land, and often had considerable trouble in collecting its rent; when the tribes were small and weak it attempted to set aside their claims, and the result was acute agrarian discontent and disorder. The same difficulty occurred on tapu lands, where the ownership of the proprietor, who was often an absentee, was in many cases merely nominal. Most of the cultivable area of Mesopotamia has been either managed directly by some Government department [miri and saniych)190 AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE or held in large estates by landlords, who either occupy win lands which they rent, or are supposed to rent from the State, or own their own freehold as tapu. These landlords are generally either tribal chieftains (Arab sheikhs or Kurdish aghas), or wealthy notables of the towns from Basra or Baghdad, and occasionally magnates of the empire such as the late Mahmud Pasha Daghistani and Kadlum Pashci. It lias been estimated that 80 per cent, of the whole cultivable area in the Baghdad vilayet was and another 30 per cent. sanlyeh ; much, too, of the Basra vilayet came under one or other of these categories, chiefly miri, M lands are usually let on short leases for one, two, or three years, but by law the tenant may transfer his lease to another party with the consent of the authorities, and in case of his death his leasehold passes to his heirs, unless he has left the land uncultivated for three years. It is possible that on some lands the Grovernment acknowledged an obligation to keep the canals in order; in the Tigris districts near Kut el-Amara it has been stated that the sheikhs on certain lands paid revenue to the Grovernment at a reduced rate, and in return were consideied responsible for canal clearance as well as for the maintenance of order in their tribes. Sanlyeh lands comprise many of the most fertile and best-cultivated estates in the country. On the Euphrates about Hilla a considerable amount of the land originally offered for sale under the conditions of tapu by Midhat Pasha was later acquired by Abdul Hamid. These lands are known locally in the Euphrates districts as mudawwareh. Canal clearance on land was paid for by the Crown, and seed was advanced to be recovered at harvest. It seems to have been the custom to maintain a mamur (revenue official) and granary staff on sanlyeh estates. In Irak private ownership of land occurs mainly in the form of tenure known as titpu. Tapu lands are those ot which the owner ship (under certain conditions) has been purchased by individuals from the State. The history of this tenure in Irak, which dates from the governorship of Midhat Pasha in the early seventies, is sketched below (pp. 193-4). The estates held by tapu are mostly in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, but are found also on the Tigris. As has been already mentioned, they escheat to the State in case of failure of heirs. The land is, as a rule, leased out for terms of five years or less by the landowner, who selects which lands are to be cultivated and which are to lie fallow. Estates are often sublet to and farmers, who collect the fellahin, as a rule tribesmen with an hereditary con nexion with the area. The owner is responsible for canal clearanceAGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 191 and maintenance, the cultivators provide both seed and cattle, or when seed is found for them it is as a loan to be repaid at harvest. In some cases both parties are jointly responsible for the transport of the ^ Government share up to a distance of three miles from the threshing-floor. Information as to land tenure in upper Mesopotamia is very scanty. It appears that most of the cultivated land is held in large estates either by wealthy townsmen or by tribal chiefs. It is stated that round Mosul most of the land is owned by the families that in the past formed the ruling oligarchy of the town, and that landed property held by a member of one of these families may not be alienated without the consent of the head of the house. estates occur in upper Mesopotamia. It seems that in some districts (e .g. round Kirkuk and Mosul) the lands of a village may be owned by the cultivators. Taxation of Agriculture Under the Turkish regime the produce of the land has been divided between the State, the landlord, and the cultivator. The proportions in which this division has been made as well as the amount actually paid have varied according to circumstances, such as the form of tenure on which the land is held, the method of irrigation, the labour required in cultivation, the extent to which the owner has assisted the cultivator by providing seed, &amp;c., the power of the administra tion or of the owner to press their claims, and the power of the tax payers and cultivators to evade those claims by force or bribery. Cultivated lands are to a great extent classed for purposes of assessing taxation or rent according to the means by which they are watered. Daim is land dependent on rainfall alone ; hakrah or saqi is land watered by lifts or buckets; saih is land irrigated from canals ; chaltiq land is watered by small runnels, such as are used in rice- fields. Vegetable lands have usually not been liable to taxation, nor to the payment of any fixed proportion of the produce as rent, except where vegetable gardens were specially valuable, as in the neighbour hood of large towns. The State's proportion of the produce consisted mainly of the tithe, which usually amounted to about 20 per cent, of the produce of the land, though the share claimed by the Govei-nment on this account varied somewhat from one district to another. The proportion claimed on rice was sometimes higher than that on other grain crops, and land watered by lifts paid at a higher rate than that irrigated by canals. Payment was made in money or in kind at the option of192 AGEICULTUKE AND LAND TENUEE the producer. On some lands the tithe was compounded for at a fixed sum. Thus for the date-plantations on the Shatt el-Arab Midhat Pasha introduced a system by which the tax was levied according to the number of trees, and at rates proportioned to the distance of the plantations from the river. The number of trees charged for has been sometimes entirely different from and usually considerably less than the number of trees in existence. The tithe on liquorice root was compounded for by a special arrangement with Constantinople. A fixed sum was also levied on wood that was cut for sale. Where a fixed assessment had not been made the usual method employed by the Government was to send round officials to judge the value of the Government share of the crop, and this share was then farmed out. In addition to tithe there were other taxes assessed on agricultural produce, for war expenditure, for municipal purposes, or for educa tion. These might amount together to an eighth or a quarter of the tithe. Koda, the tax on domestic animals, was a tax which should have fallen particularly on the nomad tribes but was correspondingly difficult to collect. It amounted as a rule to half a mejidi per annum on each camel, buffalo, &amp;c., and 12 rah) piastres per sheep. This tax was usually farmed out. The share received by the Government on land represented the land taxation due to the State, together with the rent due to the State as landowner. Roughly speaking, this was usually 20 per cent, on each of these counts or 40 per cent, in all. In cases where on miri land a share was also paid to the sheikh of the tribe, the produce might be divided as follows: 20 per cent, for revenue, 20 per cent, for the sheikh, 5 per cent, for the or principal tenant for management, 15 per cent, for provider of seed, 40 per cent, for fellah or cultivator. On samyeh land in the Euphrates district 36 per cent, was paid to Abdul Hamid as landlord's share and revenue combined, and this seems to have been the usual proportion paid. In the Bogheileh district there was an unusual arrangement by which the cultivators were responsible for construction and maintenance of canals, and in return paid only 26 per cent, of the crops instead of the usual 36 per cent. The share of the produce claimed by the Government in tapu lands was usually 20 per cent.; but in some places, as in the Kurna district, it was 10 per cent, of all grain crops except rice, on which it was 20 per cent. The landowner's share on land is also usually 20 per cent., although in the Euphrates districts it is on certain estates 40 per cent. The higher rate was allowed by Midhat PashaAGrRICULTUEE AND LAND TENURE 198 deilnti, kit i'lj at the time when the land was sold, owing to the need of consider- iwasldii able expenditure of capital on the canal system by the new owners. The Land n m ^ In Irak the opposition between the Turkish Government's theory of land tenure on the one hand and tribal custom and sentiment on the other has created a land question which has caused much trouble ^ / in the past and still remains to be settled. Fifty years ago there was little private property in land. Almost the whole country was divided into tribal areas, and where tribes chose to cultivate the Government took its tithe, if it could, or else did not interfere. But agriculture was in a very backward state. Few of the ancient canals were cleared, and it was obvious that intelligent control and management were needed if the country was to be developed. In the view of the Turkish Government the soil occupied by the tribes was the property of the State. Starting from this theory Mid hat Pasha, when vali of Baghdad, conceived the idea that both the prosperity of the country and the Govern ment's revenue might be increased by the sale to individuals of proprietary rights in cultivated or cultivable land (especially in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates) under conditions that would encourage the development of agriculture. The propi'ietors were to arrange for the clearance and maintenance of the canals and were to help their tenants to tide over bad seasons ; in return they would receive a large share of the profits. Thus the system of land tenure already described was created. Midhat apparently hoped that the tribal sheikhs would purchase on these terms the lands occupied by their people. On the lower Euphrates the Sa'dun, the ruling clan of the Muntefiq, seem to have accepted the position of Eupbial®^ proprietors. Elsewhere the sheikhs were generally very unwilling [d's st® to buy, as they distrusted the Government's intentions. Some of jusiulpf' the tribes, fearing that the scheme meant that they were to be . alatiff 1 strictly governed and made liable for military service, took alarm jptlsi and fled for a time into the desert. Capitalists from the towns were pjrceiiti at first afraid of taking up land in face of tribal hostility, but as the country was brought more under control the acquisition of en t jjlfl' estates became more attractive to them. In the Hilla district , m K a stimulus to investment in land was given by Abdul Hamid, who acquired several large estates here and set about developing them. ■ ; In one way or another a great deal of land, especially along the nd I s , bY pP| — ^ ' MES. I N . ]S 0ll if Euphrates, became private property of the class. And so it 1 j|utl came about that the tribes found themselves in the position of rent-194 AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE paying tenants on lands which they regarded as their own. Many of the new landlords were absentees and quite unconnected with the tribesmen who cultivated their estates. How far the icipu proprietors fulfilled their duties of canal clearance and so forth is not clear. At any rate their claims were bitterly resented by the cultivators. Thus when the Government's authority Was weakened after the Revolution of 1908-9 a kind of agrarian revolution followed. The result has been that owners of tapu estates have become unable either to collect their rents or to undertake their responsibilities. The tribesmen look upon the landlords as intruders who make oppressive and unjust demands upon the cultivators and rightful owners of the soil. The landlords appeal to their title-deeds and complain that they are being robbed of what by law and justice is clearly theirs. Both sides look to the Government of the country to support their claims, which need careful consideration and adjustment. Apart from this difficult question of the estates there were many abuses and anomalies in the system of land tenure and land taxation as it was at the beginning of the war. Corruption entered into all transactions of the administration touching the land, especially into the leasing of the lands which the State had at its disposal and into the assessment and collection of the revenue derived from the produce of the soil. Tnus in the Amara district, where in theory the miri and samyeh lands paid a proportion of their produce to the Crown, in practice the land was put up to auction and leased for cash rents to the highest bidder. There was intense rivalry among the tribes, and wholly fictitious prices were bid which could never be paid but which were pleasing to the heads of the revenue department. The highest bidder, usually a sheikh, sublet the lands, which were again sublet to the result being a chain of debt and extortion which the land could never support and which was liable at any moment to bring ruin to all concerned in it.CHAPTER XII COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY General character of commerce—Distribution of foreign trade and German competition—Trade methodb—Principal imports—Principal exports— Industries. General Character of Commerce It is impossible to give an accurate account of the trade of Mesopotamia as it was in the years immediately preceding the war, since there are no reliable figures to serve as data. The Turkish Customs kept no trustworthy statistics, and the information collected for the consular trade reports was based on unofficial estimates which were generally more or less rough guesses. For the trade carried by the Hamburg-Amerika line the British reports were wholly dependent on German sources. The figures therefore given below, which are taken from, or based on, the trade reports, must no ( t be regarded as exact. Among the principal imports were textiles, refined sugar, machinery (in Irak), coffee, tea, timber (in Irak). Manchester goods were by far the most valuable class of import. There was also some importation of miscellaneous manufactured articles (hardware, glassware, cutlery, candles, paper, &amp;c.), and of metals (chiefly copper and iron). It seemed probable that Russian and American oil would be driven froin the market of lower Mesopotamia by the produce of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's wells in Arabistan. A very large part of the imports was destined for the Persian market, mainly by the Baghdad Kirmanshah route. There are no manufactures of importance in the country, and the export trade to Europe, America, and India was mainly in agricultural, pastoral, and natural vegetable produce (e. g. dates, barley, rice, wheat, and other cereals ; wool, skins and hides ; gM ; liquorice, galls). The export of oil from Arabistan was being developed on the eve of the war. A proportion of the exports was in transit from the Persian plateau (e. g. opium, gum tragacanth, and carpets). The principal market for foreign trade was Baghdad. Basra was important chiefly as the port of Baghdad, but was also the centre of n 2196 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY the commerce of southern Irak and especially of the Shatt el-'Arab date trade. Diarbekr and Mosul were the chief markets of upper Mesopotamia. The foreign trade of Arabistan was carried on through Mohammareh and Ahwaz. The main current of import trade entered Mesopotamia from the Persian Gulf by way of Basra. The local market of southern Irak absorbed a very moderate part of it, less, it seems, than a quarter. The main volume of this current passed up the Tigris to Baghdad. 1 Probably more than half of the goods which reached the Baghdad market found their way by Khanikin and Kirmanshah into Persia, while the remainder supplied northern Irak, or passed on to the Mosul market 2 or even as far as Diarbekr. But the Diarbekr market was for the most part supplied by a secondary current of imports which came from Alexandretta and Aleppo. The Mosul market was partially fed by this current, which was even felt (though not in any great degree) as far south as Baghdad. The imports of Arabistau came from the Persian Grulf mostly through Mohammareh ; a pro portion of them passed on to the Isfahan market. The principal current of export trade passed out into the Persian Gulf by Basra, the port which was the outlet of Irak and through Baghdad drew exports from western Persia and the Mosul region. The main part of the exports of Diarbekr, a considerable part of those of Mosul, and a small proportion of those of Baghdad went to Aleppo for Alexandretta or Egypt. The exports of Arabistan went out by the Persian Gulf through Mohammareh. The annual value of the trade of Baghdad in the years immediately before the war was between 3^- and 4 millions. This estimate excludes the large imports of material for the Baghdad Railway. The value of the remaining imports was 3-4 times greater than that ot the exports. The annual value of the trade of Basra (including imports to and exports from Baghdad) was over 5 millions: the average for the years 1911-13, inclusive of the imports of railway material, was about £5,700,000. Exports amounted to about 2^ millions as against I—1 million at Baghdad. This difference was due principally to the Shatt el-'Arab date trade, and partly to the export from the Basra vilayet of grain, rice, gM, and wool. The trade of Diarbekr was valued at somewhat over a million, 1 While Baghdad was the general distributing centre for piece-goods, the towns on the Euphrates in western Irak seemed to have received a part of their other imports direct from Basra. 1 . _ . 2 Suleimaniyeh and Kirkuk, the chief local markets of southern ^Tuikish) Kurdistan, dealt mainly with Baghdad, and to a much smaller extent with Mosul and Aleppo.COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 197 , ' ' i imports being about 55 per cent, of the whole. Mosul had a total J trade of between ^ and ^ million, the value of the exports being times that of the imports. The trade of Arabistan,' exclusive of the import of plant and ' |,ls ia material for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, was about £850,000 ; teil in value. Imports made up about 59 per cent, of this sum. The value of the trade of Mesopotamia was on the whole rising in ■ % spite of considerable fluctuations. Thus in the ten years 1904-13 ■ the trade of Baghdad had increased by about 50 per cent., that of Basra perhaps by about 75 per cent., that of Diarbekr by about ssedonltt 27 per cent. In the trade of Mosul there does not seem to have iarWmi been any marked general tendency towards an increase or decrease. tDtofimn The trade of Arabistan had more than doubled in five years; this 'Imik increase was due partly to the transfer (owing to political disturbances) Jmoliii of much Persian trade from the Bushire—Shiraz road to the Ahwaz— s of Mi Isfahan route, partly to the development of the oilfield in northern Arabistan. Though it is to be remembered that the growth of the trade in to tie P® these markets is largely to be accounted for by the expansion of the kdfti commerce with Persia passing through them, it appears that the Idle purchasing power and wants of the local population were on the whole V i : increasing, especially in Irak and Arabistan. As customers the i jjjd natives displayed, as was to be expected, a tendency to take cheap inWffl* inferior goods in preference to better but more expensive articles, as well as a readiness to be impressed by tawdry colour and ornamen- .jmud tation, and an attachment to familiar appearances and trade-marks. The principal circumstances determining the fluctuations in the jj 1?1 trade of the country (apart from the state of markets in Europe and America) were conditions in Persia, and the local agricultural and r jj. pastoral production. The varying amount of insecurity on the ' Lj Persian trade-routes, and the unsettled condition of Persia generally, 1)6 . m , reacted seriously on the Baghdad market. Again, a bad harvest in , |M ' Mesopotamia, due to insufficient rainfall, excessive or insufficient 'floods, &amp;c., might cause a very marked general depression in trade. P' ' 'i Drought or inclement weather destructive to live stock in the Meso- potamian plains might have some effect in the same direction. Other I disturbing factors were outbreaks of disorder in Mesopotamia and rerl Arabistan, the unstable currency, and speculative operations by local ^ merchants. A standing impediment to commerce was the inadequacy of means of transport and of storing goods. The insufficiency of steamer b-i: transport and the difficulties of navigation on the river-route between itr.: 8 ''' Basra and Baghdad caused much delay and damage to merchandise;198 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY and freight-charges on this main line of communication were high. The pack-transport used on land was costly, especially on some routes (for example that from Ahwaz to Isfahan) on which the supply of mules was running short. That the Arab, Lur, and Kurdish tribes are more or less dependent on urban markets for the comforts and even (especially in the case of the desert nomads) for some of the necessities of life, gives to the internal trade of the country a considerable political importance. To have control of these markets is to have a means of bringing powerful pressure to bear on some of the most unruly and least accessible elements in the population.

The balance of the sailing-vessel tonnage was made up by Ottoman, Persian, and a few French vessels, and by dhows from Zanzibar. In 1916-17, 110 steam-vessels carrying merchandise entered the port of Basra. This tonnage amounted to 157,362. Of these vessels 95 were British, 8 Japanese, 5 Norwegian, and 2 Swedish. Sailing- vessels have taken a greatly increased share in merchant traffic.COMMEKCE AND INDUSTRY 199 At the end of 1913 the ocean steamer service to Basra was carried on by the following lines: The Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Company, Ltd. (from England). The Strick Line (from England). Messrs, Marcus Samuel &amp; Co, (from England). Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co, (from England). The British India Steam Navigation Company (from Bombay and Karachi). The Arab Steamers, Ltd. (from Bombay). The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company (from Bombay). The Haji Sultan AH Shushtari Line (from Bombay), The Hamburg-Amerika Line (German, from Hamburg and Antwerp). The Russian Steamship Navigation Company (from Odessa). The value of trade carried by German vessels in the years 1911-13, according to German returns, was as follows : 1911.—Imports, £397,960 (13-9 per cent, of the total imports). Exports, £294,142 (11-6 per cent, of the total exports). 1912.—Imports, £528,415 (20 per cent, of the total imports). Exports, £375,760 (11-5 per cent, of the total exports). 1913.—Imports, £1,957,489 (50 per cent, of the total imports). 1 Exports, £226,212 (11-7 per cent, of the total exports). In 1917 the service between Basra and India was being carried on by the following lines: The British India Steam Navigation Company. The Arab Steamers, Ltd. The Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company. The Haji Sultan Ali Shushtari Line. The Abad Company (Japanese steamers under the nominal charter of Mirza Mohammed Shirazi). Basra Data for comparing the different shares of foreign countries in the Basra market are lacking. As regards the export of the produce of the Basra vilayet the following points may be noticed: A large part of the date harvest of the Shatt el-Arab went to the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Rice and paddy went to the United Kingdom and Germany. GM went to India and the Levant. 1 The increase in this year was mainly in railway material and sugar.200 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY Lower Tigris For the transport of goods on the Tigris between Baghdad and Basra the two important companies were : The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch ; three steamers, with barges). The Ottoman Nahrieh Company (managed by the Dairat es- Sanlyeh ; five steamers, with barges). The Shatt el-'Arab above Basra was closed to foreign shipping with the exception of the limited number of steamers allowed to the E.T.S.N. Co. Before the war it was arranged that the British and Ottoman interests should be combined in an Anglo-Ottoman company. It was proposed that the British and Turkish shares in the new com pany should be equal, but that 40 per cent, of the Turkish share, or 20 per cent, of the whole, was to be held by the Baghdad Railway Company, i. e. was to be secured to German interests, in return for a similar minority interest to be held by the British in the extension of the Baghdad Railway to Basra.

Of secondary imports from this country may be mentioned woollens, machinery (to Baghdad), coffee (from Brazil), and copper. In exports the United Kingdom took chiefly wool and mohair, skins and hides, cereals, dates, gum tragacanth, and occasionally opium. Import trade from India was chiefly in coarse cotton goods, cotton yarns, gunnies, tea, and silk. In the two years preceding the war Indian timber was driven from the Baghdad market by cheap Russian woods. It seems that a considerable part of the manufactured goods (including refined sugar) that were entered as imported from India were of European continental origin. In exports India took dates, ghl, horses, occasionally opium, and small quantities of galls, hides and skins, wool, &amp;c. Since the British occupation of Irak the Indian piece-goods trade in southern Mesopotamia has acquired a stronger position. Germany had a miscellaneous trade in cheap manufactured goods, and imported also sugar, chemical dyes, and alcohol. Her consider able and growing share in the carrying trade to Basra consisted largely in the shipping of Belgian, Austro-Hungarian, and other foreign goods. (See further below, pp. 204-5.) Germany took considerable proportions of the cereals (which before the war were shipped almost wholly by German steamers), of the galls, and of the hides and skins exported from the country. Among other exports to Germany were intestines (for sausage-making), and a small per centage of the Mesopotamian wool. Austria-Hungary had a large share in the sugar trade, and sent also fancy textiles, hardware, glassware, chinaware, paper, and other kinds of cheap manufactured goods. Some hides and skins, grain, galls, &amp;c., went to Trieste.204 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY Belgium's share in the trade of Mesopotamia was rapidly growing. Belgian loaf-sugar dominated the markets of Baghdad and Basra (it was carried to the Persian G-ulf by German ships), and had about a quarter share in the Diarbekr market. Besides, Belgium sent iron, copper, and candles. France had recently lost to Belgium her former lead in the Baghdad sugar trade. Her principal exports to Baghdad were leather and drugs and medicines. To Diarbekr she sent hardware, glassware, &amp;c. She took a considerable part of the export of wool, hides and skins. Imports from Italy were mainly cheap cotton goods. Her trade seems to have been mainly with northern Mesopotamia. Russian timber had in 1918 almost driven Indian wood from the Baghdad market. Russian oil had lost ground to American and Persian in Irak, but apparently it still held a predominant share in the market of Diarbekr. Sweden supplied nearly the whole import of matches. The United States sent very little besides oil, and, though American petroleum had won the lead from Russian in southern Mesopotamia, it seemed likely to yield in its turn to the product of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's field in Arabistan. In exports the United States took a o large share of the Shatt el-'Arab dates and practically all the Mesopotamian liquorice. Most of the Persian carpets which passed through the Baghdad markets went to America. Japan had hardly any trade in Mesopotamia before the war, but it was stated in 1917 that 'the markets in Mesopotamia are already flooded with cheap Japanese glassware, matches, cutlery, copper, metal sheets, and some kinds of piece-goods, especially what is known as American sheeting'. China took Persian opium shipped from Basra, and sent silk to Baghdad. Egypt took camels and sheep from Mosul and Diarbekr, dates from Irak, and some silk goods manufactured at Baghdad. The most interesting element in the situation before the war was the politico-commercial intrigue that was being carried on by Ger many in Irak and Arabistan. The German plan to dominate and exploit the Turkish Empire included the intention to clear away the zone of British influence at the head of the Persian Gulf. When the prospects of a German railway to Baghdad seemed assured, German diplomacy set to work, on the one hand to obtain the right to estab lish a German-controlled railway from Baghdad to the Gulf, and onCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 205 the other hand to push German commerce in lower Mesopotamia and Arabistan through a subsidized line of steamers to Basra. German trade had hardly existed in Irak before 1895. Between 1895 and 1906 German firms had built up businesses here, chiefly in miscellaneous fancy goods, hardware, glassware, and the like, and a branch of the Deutsche Orient Bank was opened at Basra in 1903. But German competition was of little importance in the Baghdad market until 1906, when the Hamburg-Amerika line started a regular service of steamers from Hamburg and Antwerp to Basra and the Persian Gulf. This was the beginning of a serious commercial attack on Irak and Arabistan supported by the German Government. The Ham- burg-Amerika line was subsidized so that it was able to cut rates beyond the limits of ordinary commercial competition. As a result it captured a considerable part of the carrying trade to Basra. It pushed Belgian and other Continental goods into Mesopotamia ; especially, it had the import of Belgian loaf-sugar which came to dominate the sugar markets of the Persian Gulf and Baghdad. Immediately before the war an attempt was being made by the German line to obtain a share in the carriage of Manchester goods. As regards the export trade, the Germans had by 1913 acquired practically the whole shipping of cereals from Mesopotamia. In 1906 Germany had 4-1 per cent, of the total tonnage of steam-vessels at the port of Basra, while British shipping made up 91-5 per cent.; in 1913 the British share was 77-9, the German 16-3. At the same time the Germans were trying to open a way for their commerce into Arabistan. They had started a steamer service on the Karun, and had established stores and wharves at Mohammareh and Ahwaz. The firm of Wonckhaus had the local agency of the Hamburg- Amerika line and the principal part in the execution of German commercial policy in the country. Trade Methods It has been the custom that the buyer of agricultural produce destined for export should advance a sum of money to the owner on the security of the crop before it has matured, receiving a or promissory note, in consideration of the loan, which bears interest at comparatively high rates. An analogous method was followed in the purchase of the wool-clip. Buyers have often made large profits by shipping direct; the produce may, however, be put on the local206 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY market and change hands several times at enhanced prices, payment being made by instalments. The creation of some convenient form of agricultural credit is essential to the development of the country. The Turkish land-banks at Diarbekr and Mosul did not work suc cessfully. In the import trade the larger firms sent orders direct to Europe, and it appears that most of the cotton goods imported were purchased in this way. Another method followed in Irak was to order goods through commission houses. A small initial deposit was made with the commission house, the balance being paid on the arrival of the goods. The small trader paid by instalments on the security of a campiala, and collected weekly sums from the shopkeepers. For the export of Manchester goods from England to Mesopotamia English banks gave credit against shipping documents deposited with them when the goods were shipped, repayment being made some three or five months later when the goods arrived at their destination. The campiala, or promissory note payable at date, which was the usual instrument for settling accounts, was negotiable when backed by a good name. Important parts in the trade of Irak have been taken by the (native commission agent) and the (money-changer). On the honesty and intelligence of the da the European merchant was often largely dependent. The money-changing business was of great importance owing to the heterogeneous and unstable character of the currency under the Turkish regime. Further, the Baghdad assayed Turkish coins (since, for example, which would have been accepted in Basra or Aleppo might not have been accepted in Baghdad), acted as collector of bills and payments, and did a con siderable business as private bankers. The practically fixed the rates of bills for the merchants. In the population of Mesopotamia the most important commercial elements have been the Jews in Baghdad and Irak, and the Arme nians in the north. Many Baghdad Jews had established them selves at Manchester or Hamburg as partners or agents for Jewish firms in Mesopotamia. The Jewish merchants of Baghdad had not only eclipsed their Mohammedan and oriental Christian competitors, but, it has been said, through their connexions with Manchester were gaining ground in the import of piece-goods at the expense of British firms. The tendency of the native merchants to indulge in speculative ventures and short-sighted commercial added greatly to the instability of trade in the country.COMMEKCE AND INDUSTRY Among the most important European firms established in the country before the war were : Lynch &amp; Co. (merchants, exporters and importers, shipping agents; Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company). Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. (general and shipping agents, merchants and importers). Strick, Scott &amp; Co. (general and shipping agents, merchants and importers). Blockey, Cree &amp; Co. (agents). The Anglo-Persian Oil Company. MacAndrews, Forbes &amp; Co. (American ; exporters of liquorice). Wonckhaus (German ; agents for the Ham burg-Amerika line). Since the British occupation of Irak several Bombay firms have opened branches in the country. In 1917 the following banks had branches in Irak : The Imperial Ottoman Bank. The Imperial Bank of Persia (also in Arabistan). The Eastern Bank (with charge of the funds of the civil adminis tration). Before the war the Deutsche Orient Bank had a branch at Baghdad, and the Imperial Ottoman Bank branches at Diarbekr and Mosul. Principal Imports The accurate analysis of imports is made impossible not only by the general unreliability of the estimates in the Trade Reports, but also by the fact that the country to which imported goods are ascribed in the Reports is by no means always the country of their origin. Especially, as has been mentioned above, a considerable part of the manufactured ' Indian' imports to Mesopotamia and Arabi stan came from European continental countries by way of re-export from Bombay or Karachi. Textiles, Y$c. Cotton Fabrics. —The value of cotton goods imported to Baghdad (about half of which probably went on to Persia) was between £1,340,000 and ,£1,400,000, or about 44 per cent, of the total value of the foreign imports of Baghdad exclusive of railway material. The import of cotton goods at Basra (mostly for Baghdad) was in about the same proportion. In Arabistan the value of the cotton tissues imported was about £180,000-214,000, or about 31 per cent, of the .whole .foreign import trade ; at Diarbekr it was about £125,000, |208 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY or about 24 per cent, of the foreign imports ; at Mosul it was about &lt;£30,000-40,000, or about 24-25 per cent, of the foreign imports. Cotton fabrics were mostly from Manchester. The United King dom had about 75 per cent, of the cotton import trade in the Bagh dad market, about 60 per cent, in Arabistan, and the greater part of the trade at Diarbekr and Mosul. India came next with a considerable import of coarse, cheap piece- goods. It supplied about 16-17 per cent, of the Baghdad cotton imports and about a third of the cotton fabrics sent to Arabistan. The Indian piece-goods trade has been greatly developed in Irak since the British occupation. Austria-Hungary sent about 6 or 7 per cent, of the Baghdad cotton imports, mostly cheap coloured fabrics. Belgium, Italy, and Ger many had each some small share in the market; a part of the Austro-Hungarian imports were manufactured in Italy and shipped from Trieste. Recently cheap Japanese cottons have been imported in consider able quantities into Irak. At Diarbekr and Mosul Austrian, Italian, and German cotton goods had fairly important shares in the market. The thicker kinds of cotton goods, flannelettes, &amp;c., seem to have been imported into upper Mesopotamia chiefly from these countries. Cotton Yarn. —India supplied all the cotton yarn imported into Irak (£70,000-112,000) and Mosul (£17,000-20,000). Probably the yarn importedintoArabistan(£21,000-26,000)wasalsolndian. TheUnited Kingdom appears to have imported yarn to Diarbekr (about £60,000). Woollens. —There had been remarkable fluctuations in the trade in woollens in the last four years before the war. In 1910 woollens rose suddenly to rank second on the list of imports to Baghdad, their value being estimated at £315,508 and the United Kingdom's share at £280,058. It seems that this rise was due to exaggerated expec tations of a demand from Persia. The export consequently fell to £27,521 in 1911. It rose again to £62,889 in 1912 and £115,007 in 1913, but in the latter year the value of the import from the United Kingdom was only £21,582, while Italy's share was £23,680. The imports of Austria-Hungary, Germany, France, and Belgium were each week between £12,000 and £16,500 ; the import from India was valued at £6,945. There was no great sale for woollen fabrics in Irak, or in Arabi stan (where the import has been about £9,000-10,000 in value). But there was an increasing demand for woollen yarn at Baghdad to supply the local manufactures of 'a The Diarbekr market in woollens (£45,000-60,000) was shared inCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY about equal proportion by the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary Grermany, Belgium, and France, Silks.—There has been a moderate import of silk and silk goods to Baghdad (&gt;£30,000—70,000). India took the lead in this market until 1912 5 in that year and the following the import was princi pally from China. A small amount of silk went to Diarbekr and Mosul from France and Italy. Gimnies. —India supplies Mesopotamia with gunny bags for pack ing grain, &amp;c., the demand varying with the amount of the harvest. The import at Basra was valued at £111,027 in 1911, at &lt;£95,784 iii 1912, and at £76,992 in 1913. Sugar. —The market for sugar in Irak had expanded greatly in the years before the war, but was heavily overstocked in 1913, when ^™i mp0rt -^Shdad was valued at £383,563, and that at Basra at Before 1913 the greater part of the sugar imported to Irak had been loaf, but in that year great quantities of crushed sugar were landed at Basra, valued at £480,999 as against £240,100 worth of loaf. As, however, the country was passing through a depression in trade, the demand was not nearly correspondent to the supply, and great stocks were left on the hands of the importers, and much of the import did not in that year reach Baghdad. On the Baghdad market in 1913 Belgium had about 44 per cent, of the import. Belgian loaf-sugar, manufactured at the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise and shipped by the Hamburg-Amerika line, had in 1909 displaced French loaf from the lead in the markets of southern Mesopotamia. (It has been mentioned above that this import of Belgian sugar was one of the chief means used by the Germans in their commercial attack on Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf.) Germany had about 19 per cent, of the sugar import to Baghdad and Austria-Hungary about 18 per cent. These countries had most of the trade in crystal sugar. The balance of the import was divided between the United Kingdom, France, India, and the Netherlands. Egyptian and Hong-Kong sugars (the latter imported by Japanese) at present hold the market. It is believed that the sugar refined at Hong-Kong is grown in Java or Mauritius. In Arabistan the import of sugar in 1912-13 was valued at =£125,829 (£63,937 loaf, £61,892 crystal). The loaf was chiefly Belgian, the crystal mostly Austro-Hungarian. The value of the sugar import at Diarbekr in 1913 was £35,000. Austria-Hungary had about 75 per cent, of the trade, and Belgium the rest. JMcichincfy, The import of machinery to Irak for agricultural mes. i o J210 COMMEECE AND INDUSTEY purposes was growing remarkably before the war. The value of the machinery imported to Baghdad in 1902 was £3,298, in 1910 £21,191, in 19il £150,800, in 1912 £105,450, and in 1913 £169,183. This increase was partly due to the construction of the Hindiyeh Barrage and of the Baghdad—Samarra section of the Baghdad Eail- way ; but to a very large extent it was caused by the growing demand for centrifugal oil-motor pumps used in irrigation. Further, ice- machines, small flour-mills, &amp;c., were being introduced into Baghdad. The Turkish military factory at Baghdad had been supplied from Austria-Hungary. Of the import to Baghdad in 1912 the United Kingdom's share was about 94 per cent, ; in 1913 it was about 62 per cent., Belgium having about 35 per cent. The Belgian import in 1913 probably consisted largely in plant for railway construction. The United Kingdom had practically the whole trade in oil-motor pumps. The introduction of agricultural machinery into Irak is now being extended, and the import seems likely to develop rapidly in the future. The machinery imported into Arabistan appears to have been almost wholly plant for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Hardly any machinery, except a very small quantity for agricul tural purposes, had found its way into upper Mesopotamia before the war. Metals. —Normally copper and iron were the principal metals imported to Irak. In 1913 large quantities of steel were brought in for railway construction. The value of copper imported to Irak seems to have averaged about £50,000 a year, but was subject to great fluctuations. The United Kingdom had most of the trade (50-75 per cent.); Belgium and India shared the balance. Iron (bars, hoops, pipes, girders, &amp;c.) was imported to Irak nor mally to the value of £20,000-50,000. Belgium had most of the trade, supplying especially girders and pipes. The use of iron girders at Baghdad for building purposes was increasing. Bar and rod iron appears to have come from Sweden, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. The iron and steel landed at Basra in 1913 was valued at £1,207,882 ; this abnormal import was due to railway construction at Baghdad. In the Diarbekr market metals (copper, iron, tin, &amp;c.) were im ported in 1913 to the value of £39,200, of which £31,700 worth was entered as coming from the United Kingdom, the rest from Germany and Belgium. It had been reported in 1907 that German andM COMMEECE AND INDUSTRY 211 Swedish iron and steel had ousted the English products from this market. Timber. The plains of Mesopotamia are practically treeless except where there are date-palms, and Irak and Arabistan depend on impoi ted timber. A large part of the wood brought to Basra was used for date-boxes ; timber is also imported for house and boat building. The import of wood for date-boxes to Basra amounted in a normal year to between 250,000 and 300,000 bundles valued at £110,000-150,000. The import of planks varied between 130,000 and 570,000 valued at £20,000-85,000. The timber brought to Baghdad market in 1912 and 1913 was worth &lt;£15,000-16,000 in each of these years. The import of wood to Arabistan for 1910-11 was 870 tons (£5,598); for 1911-12, 671 tons (£5,428); for 1912-13, 1,832 tons (£15,455)—an increase due to the extension of Mohammareh town, and the growth of the boat-building industry there. The wood for date-boxes came from Austria-Hungary, Scandinavia, and Russia. India apparently exported a good deal of wood for boat-building, &amp;c., to Basra and Mohammareh, but at Baghdad, after monopolizing the timber market, had lost it entirely in 1912-13 to Russia, whose cheap white woods supplied 94 per cent, of the import. Coffee. The coffee imported to Basra amounted on an average to about 14,000 bags a year, the quantities varying between 8,000 and 18,000 bags (valued at £33,000-73,000). At Baghdad the import varied between 4,000 and 11,000 bags (valued at £16,000-17,000). The value of the coffee brought to the Diarbekr market was estimated at £10,000 ; at Mosul the import was estimated at £2,000-4,500, The coffee sent to Mesopotamia was mostly Brazilian-grown and imported from the United Kingdom, which had about 66 per cent, of the trade to Baghdad. Brazilian coffee was also shipped from Hamburg and Marseilles. India was credited with about 20-22 per cent, of the import to Baghdad in 1911-13, and the whole of the import to Mosul. Tea. —The consumption of tea among the Arabs in Mesopotamia and Arabistan. has been increasing. The amount imported to Basra in a normal year was about 19,000-20,000 cases valued at £24,000-25,000. An import to Baghdad of about 18,000 cases was valued at about £81,000. The tea passing through Mohammareh into Arabistan in 1910-11 was 142 tons (£15,209); in 1911-12, 106 tons (£10,341); in 1912-13, 64 tons (£10,626) ; but large quantities were smuggled into the country owing to the high duties levied by the Persian Customs. There was a small, slowly increasing import to Diarbekr valued at £1,100 in 1912, and at £1,300 in 1913, o 2212 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY Almost all the tea imported to Irak and Arabistan came from India ; a small quantity was sent to Baghdad from China. The tea on the Diarbekr market was entered as coming from the United Kingdom. Petroleum. —The demand for oil in lower Mesopotamia was in creasing before the war with the growing use of mechanical pumps for irrigation. The need of petroleum for fuel and lighting may be expected to increase greatly in the future. The imports to Basra amounted in 1910 to 108,400 cases ; in 1911 to 50,070 cases ; in 1912 to 209,200 cases ; in 1913 to 332,670 cases. Before 1911 Russian oil had dominated the market; in 1911 and 1912 American (Standard Oil Company's) oil was rapidly gaining ground ; in 1913 the lead was taken by the produce of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's field in Arabistan. Of the 332,670 cases imported in that year 179,294 came from Arabistan, 87,000 con tained Russian oil, and 66,376 American. The value of the whole import amounted to ,£91,484. The value of the oil imported at Diarbekr was £30,000, three- fourths being Russian, one-eighth Rumanian,and therest from Austria- Hungary and the United States. Indigo and Other Byes. —Up to 1913 Mesopotamia had been sup plied with vegetable indigo from India, which sent yearly about £20,000 worth to Basra. In 1913 German and Belgian synthetic indigo was put on the Baghdad market with some success., In that year the import of vegetable indigo from India to Baghdad was 566 cases valued at £16,922 (as compared with 631 cases in 1912 and 670 cases in 1913). The import of synthetic indigo in 1913 was 1,302 cases valued at £32,500. Other natural dyes (henna, &amp;c.) came from Persia, and there was an import of aniline dyes, besides indigo, from the Continent. Leather. —The value of the leather annually imported to Baghdad in the five years 1909-13 varied considerably. In 1909 it was £14,843; in 1910 £28,808; in 1911 £5,595; in 1912 £26,691; in 1913 £16,779. This import came chiefly from France. India sent a cheap quality. Buffalo-hides from Hong-Kong were used for shoe- leather. Drugs and Medicines. —The annual import of drugs and medicines at Basra amounted to about 7,000-8,000 packages, with an estimated value of about £24,500-£28,000. The imports to Baghdad in the years 1911-13 are given as follows: in 1911, 7,974 packages (£43,190); in 1912, 3,375 packages (£30,785); in 1913, 1,390 packages (£43,475), In 1912-13 the import to Arabistan was valued at £5,599.COMMEECE AND INDUSTKY 213 116 fffj lilt iQi iailCe fornierl y th© lead on the Baghdad market, but in -^13 the greater part of the import was entered as coming from the United Kingdom and India, the shares of the different countries being as follows: India 39 per cent., the United Kingdom 17 il fc P er cen ^' France 37 per cent, Belgium 5 per cent. ; Germany and Austria-Hungary divided the balance. In 1906 it was reported that in northern Mesopotamia practically all the drugs on the market were French or German. I'opc). From six to twelve thousand bales were imported yearly to Baghdad, valued at .£25,000—48,500. About three-quarters of the impoit came from Austria-Hungary. India, Belgium, and Grermanv had most of the remainder of the trade. The paper imported to Diarbekr, valued at .£17,500-,£18,000 was entered as coming from France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany. Matches. —The import at Basra varied between about 5,000 and 7,500 cases. The estimated value of the import at Basra was about £3 a case; at Baghdad it varied from about £3 to about £6 a case. Candles. —The import at Basra varied from about 6,000 to about 13,000 cases, valued at about £2 a case, and coming from Belgium, India, France, and Germany. The candles imported to Diarbekr were mostly French. Provisions. —The quantities imported to Basra were : in 1911 24,962 packages (£74,886) ; in 1912, 26,795 packages (£80,385); in 1913, 40,335 packages (£100,562). The import came from India, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Goal. About 21,000-25,000 tons of Welsh coal were imported to Basra yearly, for use on river and ocean steamers. Tobacco was imported to Mesopotamia from Persia. China and Glassware: Enamel W These imports came mostly from Austria-Hungary and Germany, and the trade in Irak and Arabistan was in the hands of German and Austrian firms. About 5,000-6,000 cases of china and glass ware were imported annually to Baghdad ; Austria-Hungary had the lead in this trade. Window-glass came largely from Belgium. Cutlery came mostly from Germany. Enamel ware came from Austria-Hungary and India; some part of the Indian import may have been of European manufacture. Clothing. —There was a small but growing trade in European clothing, chiefly of Continental manufacture. Austria-Hungary imported fezes.214 COMMEECE AND INDUSTRY Principal Expoets Particulars of the export trade of Mesopotamia must necessarily be confined almost entirely to the period before the war. A certain amount of information on trade matters is, however, available for the year 1916 ; from particulars of exports from Basra in that year, it appears that the date trade of the Shatt el-Arab has not been seriously affected (see below, p. 215). Very little grain was exported from the country. There was an export of wool, mostly to London, of 16,343 bales, which is less than half the amount exported before the war, and of hides and skins, horses, &amp;c., to Bombay in about the same proportion. Dates. —The Turkish side of the Shatt el-Arab is one of the principal date-producing areas of the world, and large quantities of dates are exported annually from Basra. The trade, however, is a highly speculative one. Prices, which are in the first instance fixed by arrangement between growers and buyers, rise and fall with great rapidity, depending largely on the demands of European and American markets ; in some instances there has been keen competition from America for the crop even before the dates were ripe ; forward sales have in many cases resulted in heavy loss, the purchasing firms being left with large quantities of dates upon their hands in London and Bombay, which were unsaleable except at considerable loss. The output of dates is liable to be seriously affected by local conditions: climatic changes are at times responsible for deterioration in the crop; labour for picking may be specially plentiful in years when the grain crop is a failure, or at other times may be almost unob tainable, as in 1911, when, owing to the outbreak of cholera, the outside supply failed. Cost of freight has risen considerably in recent years. Dates for export are mostly of three kinds, viz. (1) Jiallawi, (2) Madrawi, (3) sair, and are classified as ' wet' dates as against the dry dates which are not exported to Europe and America; all three kinds are packed in cases, and are sent to the United Kingdom, to America, India, and Australia, also to Austria, Russia, the Levant, and other destinations; the dates which are packed in baskets and sent to India, Turkey, the Levant, and Persian Gulf ports, and to the United Kingdom are probably for the most part sairs. Less important varieties of dates are which are exported in bags to Karachi and Egypt, and grown for the most part round Baghdad and in the neighbourhood of Ker- bela, which are packed in baskets and skins for Bombay, Singapore, Egypt, and the Levant. There has been no export trade in dates to China up to now; it has been suggested, however, that, if datesCOMMEKCE AND INDUSTRY 215 could be popularized as an article of food in that country, a large increase in the trade from Mesopotamia would follow. According to figures in the consular trade reports, the amount of dates exported from Basra rose from 31,250 tons in 1906 to 66,169 in 1911. In this year the export was valued at £457,795, while in 1912 a decreased export of 61,490 tons was valued at a considerably higher figure, viz. £471,119 ; the price per ton in that year was £7 135. 3d ; in 1913, 75,368 tons were exported, valued at £582,074. Very little information as to trade since the war is available; it is reported however, that in 1916 dates were sent from Basra to London, Bombay, Karachi, and New York, to the amount of about 85,000 tons valued at £890,000. The marked difference between the estimate for this year and the estimates for the years before the war is probably explained, at least partly, by the fact that pre-war statistics relating to trade were by no means exhaustive, and the export figures in many cases underestimated. The average price of hallawis, and in recent years has been roughly 8s., 65., and 45. per cwt. respectively. Exports of dates from Arabistan rose from an average of about 2,000 tons between 1905 and 1908 to 6,303 tons in 1912, but fell again to 3,177 in 1913; dates grown on the Persian side of the Shatt el-Arab are usually found to be inferior to those grown on the opposite bank; this is said to be owing to the better cultiva tion on the Turkish side. Dates grown in Arabistan are principally sairs. Wheat and Barley. —The volume of the export trade from Mesopo tamia in wheat and barley, although in favourable years considerable, has been liable to very great fluctuations. This is due to a variety of causes: in seasons where there is a deficiency of rainfall, or where the supply of water for irrigation is low, the export dwindles almost to nothing; tribal fighting has frequently prevented the shipping of the grain down the river; and other local conditions, such as the serious outbreak of cholera in 1911, may cause consider able dislocation in the trade. In years of scarcity an embargo has been placed by the Turkish Government on the export of grain from the country, or even from one vilayet to another ; at such times grain has been imported from India. Although the embargo may have occasionally been necessary in order to avert famine, it has been suggested that it did not in every case owe its existence to economic reasons. The grain trade has also been seriously affected in the past by the amount of dirt which has been found to be mixed with the corn ; this has even been known to reach 37 per cent. In 1912 the principal216 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY I exportees signed an agreement only to purchase grain if weighed after cleansing; the results, however, were disappointing. Of the two varieties of wheat produced in Mesopotamia, the large- grained sort, which contains little flour and much gluten, is chiefly- exported to India and Jeddah, or consumed locally ; the small-grained wheat is sent to Europe. The grain is not of first-class quality. It is a hard, red wheat, and is used mainly for mixing with other varieties. The quality of the barley grown in Mesopotamia is better than that of the wheat, and there has always been a good market for it; it is largely exported for mixing with malting barley ; the sample produced in the Hilla region, known as araff, is better than that of the Amara district, and it has been said that there seems to be no reason why arag barley should not compete with that of the Black Sea or River Plate. The wheat was exported to the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf ports ; barley was sent to the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and Turkey. The amount of wheat exported from Basra (including the Baghdad export) has varied from 30,186 tons in 1908, valued at £241,093, to 1,330 tons in 1909, valued at £11,531; in 1912 it amounted to 28,044 tons, valued at &lt;£243,054. The corresponding export of barley in the same years was in 1908 52,996 tons, valued at £370,977; in 1909, 11,038 tons, valued at £82,788 ; and in 1912, 117,999 tons, valued at £1,118,490. In 1913 owing to the failure of the grain harvest of the preceding year there was practically no wheat or barley exported. The general trend of prices of both wheat and barley on the Baghdad and Basra markets has been in an upward direction, partly owing to the rise in world prices, and partly owing to local conditions such as German competition in the local grain markets; grain was first exported by a German firm in 1906, and by 1910 and 1911 large consignments were being bought at a high price by German mer chants. A considerable amount of wheat was sent from Mosul to the Baghdad market, whence it was exported through Basra to Europe this was valued in 1910 at £200,000. From Diarbekr surplus wheat was sent to Mosul and Baghdad, and to other provinces of the Turkish Empire; this export was uncertain, and dependent upon local conditions; the value of the export amounted in some years to £30,000. Wheat is the principal grain export of Arabistan, barley was exported for the first time in 1908; this trade has been liable to even greater fluctuations than that of Basra. A good crop of wheatCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY may be expected about three times in every decade in Arabistan. tt ^.^i a t^. was ex P 01 ^ e d for the most part from Mohammareh to the United Kingdom Germany, and India. The barley export from Aramstan in 1912-13 amounted to 2,947 tons; of this rather more tnan one-half went to Germany, and the remainder to the United Kingdom with the exception of a small export to the Arab ports ; there was no barley exported in the two preceding years. fee-Bice grown in Irak forms an important part of the export trade ot Mesopotamia. The export of paddy has increased considerably new rice-growing districts in the neighbourhood of Amara have been opened up, and in 1911 especially, owing to the failure of e Burmese crop, there was a big demand for Mesopotamian paddy in the European markets. The amount of rice available lor export is entirely dependent upon the supply of water for irrigation; in years in which this is deficient, or when the river uses late as in 1913, there is almost a complete failure of the crop, and rice has then to be imported from India ; in years of scarcity an embargo on the export of rice was imposed by the Turkish Govern ment. There is a certain amount of speculation in the trade; in some years large advances have been made to growers by buyers, w 10 have lost heavily, and in some cases received no rice or paddy at all. Rice grown in Mesopotamia is coarse in quality ; it is known in the East under the trade description of' Persian' rice; it is packed oi export in bags, weighing about 1-| cwt., and sent chiefly to the U nited Kingdom for distilling and sizing purposes ; a small quantity is sent to India as food, but Mesopotamian rice as a rule is not well suited for eating purposes. In order to popularize it further with jUiopean millers great care should be taken in cleaning the rice; until recently it has been cleaned by hand-mill at Amara, and partly Y aiK ^ Partly by machinery at Basra, where there is a large steel cleaning mill. Rice exported from Basra is sent chiefly to the United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey ; paddy is sent to the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Persian Gulf ports. The amount of rice exported in 1913 was 2,274 tons, valued at £16,684; in 1907, 4,490 tons were exported. Paddy was exported in 1912, a very exceptional year, to the extent of 64,996 tons, valued at £324,980; in 1909, 6,750 tons only were exported. In upper Mesopotamia a small amount of rice is at times sent out from the Diarbekr vilayet to other provinces of the Turkish Empire ; this has amounted in some years to a value of £15,000. From Arabistan a small surplus of the rice, which is grown in the Hawlzeh and Jerrahi districts, is exported through Basra and Koweit; this has varied in amount from 1,156 tons in 1908 to 115218 COMMEKCE AND INDUSTEY tons in 1910, and is of inferior quality. The rice grown near Dizful is said to be better, but the cost of transport is high, and by the time it reaches Ahwaz the price is as high as for rice imported from India. Seeds.—The most important seeds exported from Mesopotamia are millet, deri seed (also called idhrnh. a kind of maize), and sesame; other seeds exported include beans, haricot, lentils linseed, pulse, quince, and poppy seeds. Deri seed and millet are sown when the water recedes from flooded land ; in years when the river has been late in rising, or when there has been a rapid fall of the river after floods, the crop has been a failure, and very small quantities only have been available for exportat such times when forward sales have been made in London the shippers have lost heavily. Seeds are exported to the United Kingdom, India, Persian Gulf ports, and the Levant; in 1911 a considerable amount of millet was shipped, together with barley and paddy, to Antwerp and Ham burg; sesame is exported chiefly to the United Kingdom, and also to France, where there is a considerable demand for it. The export of seeds from Basra varied in amount from 25,338 tons in 1908, valued at £190,039, to 11,017 tons in 1910, valued at £82,629, and to as little as 3,799 tons in 1913. These figures include exports from the Baghdad vilayet, from which there came in 1912 beans (1,500 bags), deri (1,152 bags), and mash (10,123 bags), besides sesame and other seeds in smaller quantities. Prom Mosul sesame is at times exported ; this export was valued in 1911 at £1,500. From Diarbekr there is at times an export of pulse to other provinces. Arabistan exports a certain quantity of oil seeds : in 1908 this export amounted to 640 tons of linseed and sesame; the latter was sent to France, the former to the United Kingdom, Germany, and India. There has been also a small export of beans and lentils from Arabistan through Koweit to Arabia and India, though this was checked in 1909 by an export duty imposed by the Persian Customs. Wool. —The export trade in wool from Mesopotamia has been some what affected by fluctuations in the foreign demand : in some years, as in 1907, when foreign demands were small, considerable quantities have remained unsold ; in recent years, however, there has been a good sale for wool in both Europe and America, and in the future there should be no difficulty in absorbing any quantity which the country can produce. The output has also in some years been checked by adverse local conditions: a great amount of damage was done to the flocks, and their numbers were considerably reduced, by the severe'blizzard in 1911; in that year a large proportion of the woolCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 219 was skin-wool taken from dead animals, and the quality of the clip deteriorated accordingly. The practice of false packing, i. e. including dung-locks and dirty lumpy pieces rolled with good fleeces in order to increase the weight, has resulted in a lessened demand for Meso- potamian wool in Europe, except at reduced prices. The charac teristics of the three principal varieties of wool, viz. Arab, Awassi, and Karadi have already been described (see pp. 186-7). Baghdad is the principal centre of the wool trade in Mesopotamia ; from there large consignments are sent Basra to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Austro-Hungary ; all three varieties are exported. Wool-dealing in Baghdad is very speculative, and the prices at which the wool is sold are often as high as, or higher than, prices in Europe. The method of purchase is as follows: merchants advance money to Arab and Kurdish flockmasters or heads of tribes some months before the wool season commences, and agree to pay the market price of the day of delivery at an appointed station ; sometimes a sheikh or agha requiring money to pay his tax gets an advance for that purpose from a merchant, and agrees in return to make his followers deliver their wool to him ; the wool is brought to Baghdad or other centres of the trade, whei'e it is sorted and washed in a careless manner, and subsequently packed in bales weighing 340 lb. Prices in Baghdad in 1912 were : for Arab wool, washed, 18s. to 20s., for Awassi wool, unwashed, 16s. to 17s. 6ti., and for Karadi wool, unwashed, 15s. 6c?. to 17s. per 34:-375 lb. Of the quantity exported from Baghdad in that year, amounting to 34,039 bales, 37 per cent, went to the United Kingdom, 32 per cent, to France, 21 per cent, to America, and 5^- per cent, to Germany. The amount of wool exported from Basra, and including Baghdad, has varied from 17,624 bales, valued at £123,368, in 1908 to 44,392 bales, valued at ,£310,744, in 1913. Wool markets in upper Mesopotamia are at Mosul and Diarbekr; in Mosul there are a few merchants who purchase wool for the European markets, but the greater part is sent on to Baghdad or Aleppo, and sold there. Wool from Mosul is sent down the Tigris to Baghdad on rafts, and is of the Awassi and Karadi varieties ; in 1912 wool to the value of £79,000 was exported from Mosul, of which £57,000 worth went to the United Kingdom and £22,000 to other countries. Of the wool in the Diarbekr district 90 per cent, is of the Karadi variety. The wool is washed, pressed, and packed in bales of 100 okes. It was sent to Alexandretta, whence it was exported for the most part to London. There is a small export of wool from Arabistan, which amounted in 1910-11 to 407 tons, and in 1913 to 350 tons, valued at £13,473220 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY it is bi'ought from the Dizful, Shushtai*, and Ramuz districts, and exported to Europe, if in good order ; otherwise it is sent im pressed to India. Wool is exported from Arabistan in a manu factured condition in the form of carpets, which are brought from up-country, and sent to the United Kingdom, and of cloth, which is exported to Turkey. Mohair is clipped from Angora goats in the Kurdish hills; the buyers pay a fee to the headmen of the tribes, who in return help them by fixing the price of mohair in their tribe, and look after their interests generally. Mosul is the principal centre to which mohair is brought, and from which it is exported Baghdad and Basra; the annual value of the export from Mosul in recent years has been about £11,000; in 1912 it was estimated at £11,500. Mohair from the Diarbekr vilayet is of fair quality ; it comes chiefly from the Jezlret- ibn-'Omar district; the export in 1910 was valued at £10,000, in 1907 at £15,000. The price of mohair in Baghdad market was in 1912 19s. to 20s. per 28 lb. The export of mohair is through Basra; it has been sent almost entirely to the United Kingdom, where there is usually a good demand; a certain amount has gone to Germany, France, and Turkey. In 1913 the failure of Bradford spinners to support the market caused a fall in prices, and the exporters suffered loss ; in that year 1,509 bales of mohair were exported from Basra, valued at £12,072. Hides and Shins. —The export of hides and skins forms a con siderable part of the trade of Mesopotamia; not all those exported, however, are produced locally, but a large number are brought in from Persia in years when the caravan-routes are open. The trade from the highlands of Kurdistan and from Persia is liable to be interfered with by severe weather or floods, as well as by raids and insecurity generally; on the other hand in years when the grain crops fail a larger number of animals is slaughtered, with a corre sponding increase in the export of skins. Baghdad is the centre of the trade in hides and skins. The most important branch of the trade is the export of sheepskins. Raw sheepskins have been occa sionally exported both with and without wool to England and Europe, but prices of the tanned article have lately been so high that the trade in raw skins decreased ; tanned skins have been turned out in large quantities in recent years from the tanneries at Mo'adhdham, a suburb of Baghdad. In 1906 one firm alone shipped 800 bales of sheepskins tanned here, i. e. 240,000 skins representing a value of about £17,000 ; this was probably about a quarter of the total export. Tanned sheepskins in 1912 were worth from 2s. to 2s. 8d. per oke (2-83 lb.) in Baghdad. The great majority of these skins have goneCOMMEECE AND INDUSTRY 221 to London, but some went to Germany, France, and Austria. The tanning of the skins, which are brought in from all parts of the country and also from Persia, is imperfectly carried out, while the ignorance and conservatism of local tanners makes it very difficult to introduce any improvements in their methods. The export of lambskins consists partly of true lambskins from the winter lambs killed shortly after birth, of which probably 150,000 to 500,000, valued at from £7,500 to £25,000 are exported annually, partly of skins taken from the lambs born in summer and killed in the following spring. There has been a large export of these latter, chiefly to Germany and Austria, through Hamburg and Trieste. The price of these skins, which are largely used for glove- making, was in 1907 from Is. 10c?. to 2s. 6c?. per skin in the Baghdad market: it is estimated that from 150,000 to 800,000 are sent away annually; astrakhan skins were valued in the same year at from 3c?. to 2s. 6c?. per skin; the principal demand for these was from Marseilles. Goatskins are mostly exported in the form of raw goatskins with hair; these are brought in large quantities from Kurdistan and Persia. They have been exported to Europe and to the United Kingdom; most of those exported to this country have gone even tually to America; the export to Europe passed chiefly through Marseilles. The price per oke in Baghdad was in 1913 from Is. 6c?. to 2s.; the quantity exported annually is estimated at from 200,000 to 300,000 pieces, valued at from £20,000 to £30,000. A certain number of raw goatskins are tanned at Mo'adhdham. They have been exported to the United Kingdom, which is usually the best market for the tanned skins. Prices of tanned goatskins were in 1912 2s. lOd. to 3s, in 1913 3s. lc^. to 3s. 3c?. per oke. The number of ox and cowhides brought to Baghdad in an average season is from 50,000 to 60,000; these have been exported to European ports, chiefly Marseilles,, and to the United States; the estimated value is about £12,000 annually. From 8,000 to 10,000 buffalo-hides come into the market every year, of which the greater number are used locally. The amount of the total export of hides and skins from Baghdad has varied from 4,366 bales, valued at £56,760, in 1908 to 7,618 bales, valued at £108,612, in 1913; the export figures from Basra are rather less. From Mosul hides and skins are exported to the value of about £40,000 annually. There is a considerable export trade in hides and skins from Diarbekr. It appears that the bulk of the export went to France,222 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY the United States, Germany, and other parts of Turkey. Some tanned sheepskins were apparently sent to London. The export of raw goatskins has been estimated at about 100,000 pieces a year. The total value of hides and skins exported from Diarbekr in 1913 was given as £39,000. There is a small export of hides and skins from Arabistan which amounted in 1912-13 to £2,495. Gin and Batter.—The export of ghl has increased considerably in recent years, and is now becoming an important trade; it is made in the villages by the Arabs, and is collected in skins, and sent to the markets at Baghdad and Basra; in years when the rainfall is plentiful and grazing good there is a considerable surplus for export; in years of deficient rainfall it has been found necessary to prohibit the export altogether, for the sake of the local consumers. is exported from Baghdad and Basra to India, Turkey, and the Levant; in the Levant ports and at Jeddah there is a good demand for it; in * 1906 the export amounted to 14,924 cases, valued at £26,371, and in 1911 to 34,492, valued at £86,230; the average export in the last three years before the war was 25,000 cases; the price during the same period was about £4 per cwt. There is an important export of butter from Diarbekr ; this is sent overland to Syria and to the interior, and consists of cooling butter and lard for Syria, Constanti nople, and Egypt. The value of this export increased from £30,000 in 1906 to £60,000 in 1913. The export of butter and grease from Arabistan is small. Animals. (a) Camels. —The export of camels is mainly from the upper Mesopotamian plains and the Syrian Desert; there is very little export from Irak. For the Anazeh and Shammar camels, and indeed for the whole Arabian camel trade, the chief market is Damascus, where from 24,000 to 32,000 camels are bought and sold every year; most of these go ultimately to Egypt, and the remainder to Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Syria ; about 300 camels are sold in Aleppo every Wednesday for about six months in the year. The purchasing season for camels is the summer, when the Bedawis need clothes and provisions for the winter; at this season the Fed'an group of the Anazeh are in the Jezlreh, where they camp in the Khabur valley, and the Amarat group are mostly on the Euphrates near Museyib. The method of purchase of the camels is as follows: the dealers of Baghdad and Damascus employ as buyers Ageyl Arabs, such as Beni Tamlm of the Nejd, who are not engaged in perpetual tribal feuds; the purchase is arranged through the local sheikh, who receives a riydl on every camel bought and in return sees that theCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 223 animals are delivered at a fair price. The export of camels in 1912 from Diarbekr to Egypt and the interior was valued at £4,000, in 1913 at £6,000. ~ i (&amp;) Horses, —The horse export trade has been a fluctuating one, owing to various restrictions placed upon it by the Turkish Govern ment. From 1902 to 1914 the export of horses was permitted, except at the time of the Balkan War. An export duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem was charged. Horses exported, with the excep tion of those from the Diarbekr vilayet, were sent to Basra, and thence to India ; the breed of horses exported was mostly Arab. A few Persian horses were sent to India, and from the Kirkuk district a fairly useful sort of Kurdish pony was also sent. The bulk of the horses from the Mosul vilayet were purchased for the markets at Mosul, Kirkuk, and Baghdad by dealers from the Sham- mar Arabs, who visited Arab and Kurdish tribes for the purpose. Up to 1906 the price of horses at Basra increased rapidly ; from that date, however, it has remained at about the same figure. In 1910, 2,123 horses, valued at £53,075, were sent from Basra to India, but 900 of them remained for some time unsold at Bombay ; in 1912, 1,413, valued at £35,325, were exported, and in 1913, 1,749, valued at £43,725 ; a large number of these horses came from the Mosul district. From Diarbekr horses and mules were exported at a value varying between £4,500 in 1908 and £6,500 in 1913 ; these were for the most part sent overland to Syria and the Interior ; a certain number were at times sent to Egypt and to India. (c) Mules. —Mules, mostly Persian, are bought in the markets of northern Arabistan and eastern and northern Mesopotamia for use in this area; the supply, however, was diminishing before the war. There is not much export of mules from Mesopotamia ; about 400 animals passed through Baghdad market as re-exports for Syria in 1907. A certain number of mules is bred in the Diarbekr district, and of these some were sent to Syria. The Diarbekr mules are slightly inferior to the Baghdad mules ; they were valued in 1907 at about £10 each, as compared with £15 for the Baghdad mule. [d] Sheep and Goats. —The chief markets for the export of sheep from Mesopotamia to Syria and Egypt are Mosul and Diarbekr. The Baghdad export seems to have practically ceased before the war. The Diarbekr sheep came in part from outside this area, from the Dersim district, as well as a small number from Erzerum. In 1908 the Mosul district was sending annually about 100,000 sheep to Syria at about 125. each. In 1910 the value of the export of sheep from Mosul was estimated at £80,000 ; in 1912 (after the loss of stock in the severe winter of 1910-11) at £35,000. From224 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY Diarbekr sheep to the value of £200,000 were exported in 1910. In 1912 the sheep and goats sent from Diarbekr to Egypt and the interior were valued at £90,000, and in 1913 at £150,000. (e) Cattle and Buffaloes. —Cattle are exported from Mosul and Diarbekr to Syria, to other parts of Turkey, and to Egypt; the export from Mosul increased in value from £15,000 in 1907 to &lt;£30,000 in 1910, and in 1912 it amounted to £27,000; in the same year cattle to the value of £2,000 were exported from Diarbekr. Buffaloes are sent to Kaisarieh and Erzerum; the buffalo-hides are of consider able value, and are sent to other provinces of the Turkish Empire. Liquorice. —The trade in liquorice, which is almost entirely in the hands of Messrs. MacAndrews, Forbes &amp; Co., an American firm con nected with the Tobacco Trust, has at times been considerably inter fered with by the Turkish Governments which formerly imposed heavy taxes on the liquorice root; in 1909, however, the Turks granted facilities as to taxation, and a special officer was appointed to supervise the trade at the custom-house at Basra, with the result that the output was considerably increased. No liquorice paste has been manufactured in Mesopotamia; this is due to the fact that liquorice in a raw state enters America duty free, whereas the paste is subject to a prohibitive duty. There is a small export of liquorice to the United Kingdom and to France, as well as to America. The average value of the root before export from Basra is about £5 per ton. The number of the packages of liquorice exported annually from Basra has varied from 48,778 in 1909 to 13,052 in 1912 and 38,521. in 1913, valued at an equal number of pounds sterling; export duty was nominally 1 per cent, but amounted really to almost 2 per cent, owing to the various custom-house charges, stamps, &amp;c. There has been an annual export of liquorice from Mosul valued at from £2,000 to £3,600. Galls and Valonia. —Gall-nuts are produced by the larvae from the eggs deposited by the gall-fly on the oak-trees growing in the Kurdi stan hills. The galls are brought down by the tribesmen in mixed parcels to Mosul, where they are sorted and graded ; in years in which there was political disturbance in the hills the trade was adversely affected. Three sorts of galls are dealt in, viz. blues, greens, and whites ; the first of these contains the most useful tanning properties, and was most in demand in Europe ; greens were less in demand for export, though some were shipped to India ; large quantities of whites are used by local tanners, but in 1913 almost the whole of the export of white galls was taken by Germany. In recent years Germany has taken about one-half of the total export of galls, the United Kingdom has taken about a quarter, and theCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 225 &gt;1, i, Mfc ioinaiiulei' has gone to India, France, the United States, the Nether- lands, and Egypt. The prices of galls in Baghdad were in 1912 as Hi f ollows : bl ues, £10 os. to £10 10s. per kantar of 640^ lb.; whites, ifetipil mixed, £9 5sto 10s. The amount of galls exported from Basra, and including Baghdad, in 1910 was 7,616 bags, valued at £47,600, and in 1912, 24,355 bags, valued at £152,219. | G value of the export of galls from Mosul has been usually from sfc £'0,000 to £80,000 annually; in 1912 it amounted to £80,000. ikkj From Diarbekr there was an export of valonia valued in 1910 at £13,000, in 1912 at £30,000 ; this went to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the interior. There is no export of galls Wtik r&lt; T J ^ r ^ ) ^ an * &amp;um 1 ragacantJi. —This substance is obtained from one of the gum-bearing plants, and is used as a substitute for gum arable in jf ^ ie making of medicines and other commodities. The better-class gums are brought down from Persian Kurdistan, the province of . Kinnauslmh, and from Luristan and the Bakhtiyari country; the gums produced in the Mardln and Diarbekr districts of upper Mesopotamia are of poor quality. At times the supply fails owing to the unsettled state of the country and insecurity of the trade- routes. In 1909 the shrub from which the gum is taken in the Persian hills was said to be failing; good supplies, however, were forthcoming in the succeeding years. The greater part of the export of gum goes to London ; in 1913, 82 per cent, was sent from Baghdad to this market, 12 per cent, to Germany, and the remainder to Egypt, France, and America; in 1912 the average price at Baghdad was £6 5s. per cwt. Arabistan gum goes partly to London, partly to India. The gum exported from Baghdad in 1909 consisted of 640 cases and bags valued at £10,886, and in 1912, of 5,772 cases and bags valued at £75,099. The export of gums from Arabistan was !«» steadily increasing in value ; it was estimated in 1908-9 at £5,856, i n 1912—13 at £14,811. The value of gums exported annually from naiiii Diarbekr has varied between £2,000 in 1908 and £8,000 in 1913; iif® these go to France, Germany, and the interior. . Silk.—The export of silk is almost entirely from the Diarbekr i. vii' vilayet. The country round Diarbekr lends itself particularly to i: -ifc the cultivation of the mulberry-tree ; the water-supply is good, and type; 0there has been a considerable increase, during recent years, in the ' • number of trees planted. Silk is exported in two forms, raw and bat®!' 1 manufactured ; there is also an export of cocoons and cocoon waste; ■''i there is a good demand for raw silk from Aleppo and Damascus, jtotW while manufactured silk is sent to Aleppo and Constantinople; ■tr's''- cocoons are exported to France and Austria ; the export to France, mes. i p226 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY which dates from 1908, is increasing. The value of silks exported from Diarbekr was in 1907 £50,000; in 1913 silk was exported to the value of £33,000, and cocoons valued at £300. There is also an annual export of silk from Mosul and Baghdad valued at a few hundred pounds. In former times the cultivation of the silk-worm was one of the most important industries in Irak ; for some reason, however, the industry died out, but is now said to be reviving, and very large numbers of mulberry-trees have been planted in the neighbourhood of Baqubeh, about thirty miles from Baghdad. Petroleum. —The export of oil is confined to the produce of the Arabistan field, Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This company began operations on a considerable scale only in 1912, and the quantity of Persian oil on the market at Basra in that year was insignificant. The season of 19.13-14 was the first in which the company attained full marketing strength ; Anglo-Persian oil was proved to be satisfactory both in quality and price, and gained quickly in popularity; since the beginning of 1914 it has maintained a strong hold on local markets. In 1913 products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were imported to Basra from Mohammareh to the extent of 179,294 cases, and in the same year were put on the market at Baghdad for the first time in any appreciable quantity, being responsible for 48 per cent, of the total importation. See further pp. 229-30. Other Exports. —These included opium and carpets, both of which came from Persia; the opium was brought to Baghdad and forwarded to Hong-Kong ; carpets were exported to Constantinople, Syria, London, and America. Copper from the Arghana Ma'den mines in the Diarbekr vilayet was, before the war, exported to England to the value of about £35,000 annually (see below, p. 229). Dog manure was sent to Austria to be used in the manufacture of gloves, intes tines for the manufacture of sausages, and almond kernels, which are used in the making of prussic acid, were exported to the Conti nent ; colocynth, from which a drug with strong cathartic properties is manufactured, and which grows in the neighbourhood of Mosul, was also exported. Industries The industries of the country were carried on before the war almost entirely without modern machinery. In Irak there were a few mechanical flour-mills, ice-machines, wool-presses, &amp;c., mostly at Baghdad, and the Baghdad Army Clothing Factory had recently been provided with Austrian plant. These instances, together with the oil-pumps used for irrigation (see p. 160), the machinery employed on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's workings, and that introducedCOMMEECE AND INDUSTRY 227 for the construction of the Hindiyeh Barrage and the Baghdad Rail- way praetieall 7 cover the whole extent to which modern mechanical methods were used in production. Weaving.- There is a certain amount of hand-weaving in silk b S in t ? e ,. t0Wns and villa S es ^ Mesopotamia. At -Baghdad, Diarbekr, and Mosul weaving ranks as a principal industry with tanning and working in leather; it is fairly important at some other places, e. g. Nejef, Kirkuk, and Mardln. The production of silk tissues supplies the greater part of the local demand and maintains an export trade to other parts of Turkey, to t0 Per f ia - - The Chief centres of the industry are Baghdad (with Kazimain) and Diarbekr ; it exists also at Neief, Mosul and elsewhere. At Baghdad a kind of silken thread is used which is said to be a vegetable product; it is called shdri, but the name is also given to Assam or ' Moga' silk imported from Calcutta. Cotton and woollen fabrics are woven at Baghdad, Mosul, Diarbekr, Mara in, and other places in upper and lower Mesopotamia. For cotton- weavmg imported yarn is largely used (seep. 208); and imported wool is in some demand for the finer fabrics made at Baghdad. a f.^r n 7 g th . e : textl lf m j l ' u f actured at Baghdad are (a silk stuttj, alajafr (a cotton fabric), qutn (a mixture of silk and wool) striped cotton piece-goods like those of Aleppo, and coarse cotton . T f ese 7 m j lt f[ als ar e made into hafiyehs (head-kerchiefs), (cloaks),^ sharshafs (sheets), tzars (women's outer garments), (women s ve'ls), and zahuns (long body-garments worn by men). The silk fabrics ot Baghdad are famous for their colour and work- sheeting' arSe yai ' ns of local cott on are woven into ^ail-cloth and Other towns in Irak where 'aba are made are Neief, Kerbela Amara Su^ esh-Shuyukh, and Kurna. There is a good demand at Baghdad for the alas of Amara; those of Kurna are famous for their lightness ; Nejef produces silk 'abas embroidered with gold. Shrouds inscribed^ with texts from the Koran are made at the Shiah Holy Cities of Nejef and Kerbela. Woollen rugs and coarse carpets durabCaf Amara ^ r0Ugh Cari)ets ' chea P but At Diarbekr silk and cotton stuffs are the chief textile products. The unbleached cotton cloth manufactured in the towns of upner Mesopotamia is coarse but strong, and is largely used by Arabs and Kurds. There is a small export of locally worn cotton stuffs and woollen carpets from Arabistan. The black goats'hair tents of the nomads and semi -nomads are manufactured in the towns of Mesopotamia. p 2228 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY Embroidery. —Much embroidery in silk and gold thread is produced at Baghdad and Diarbekr. Dyeing.— A. dyeing industry exists at the weaving centres. On the dyes used see p. 212. Tanning and Leather Work. —Tanning is one of the principal industries of Baghdad. The tanneries are mostly in the suburb of Mo'adhdham, where in 1908 there were 40 establishments turning out about 5,000 sheepskins a week. There are smaller tanneries at Kazimain. The industry exists on a fairly large scale at Mosul and Diarbekr. The tannin used comes chiefly from Kurdish galls; there is some production of sumach-tanned leather at Mosul. On the export of tanned skins and hides to Europe and America see pp. 220-2. Local and imported leathers supply various industries at Baghdad, Mosul, and Diarbekr, and especially the manufacture of native shoes and boots. There was a Turkish military boot-factory at Baghdad. Boat-building. —The native boats in use on the rivers of Irak are built at a number of towns and villages. (On the different types of craft see pp. 288-90.) Maheilehs and large are built at Basra, at Sangar (on the right bank of the Shatt el-'Arab about 8 miles below Basra) and at Mohammareh. Smaller craft and other types) are built at several places on the Euphrates, e. g. Suq esh- Shuyukh, Samaweh, Shinafiyeh, Umm el-Ba'rur, Hindiyeh (Tawarlj), and Hit. Mashhufs are built especially at Suq esh-Shuyukh and on the Tigris at Qal'at Salih. The Sabians of southern Irak are noted boat-builders. The shaJchturs used on the middle Euphrates were before the war constructed at Birijek. During the war a has apparently been established at Jerablus. The Tteleks used on the middle Tigris are put together at Diarbekr and Mosul. Metal-worJc. —This is produced at all the principal towns of Meso potamia. The Sabian gold- and silver-smiths of lower Mesopotamia (at Amara, Suq esh-Shuyukh and Shatrat el-Muntefiq) have a great local reputation. The copper-smiths of Baghdad manufacture boilers, kettles, coffee-pots, and large copper dishes. Other towns where a good deal of copper and iron work is produced are Diarbekr, Mardln, and Mosul. J.rw5.—There has been some manufacture of arms in the towns, especially in Kurdistan. At Suleimaniyeh there is a manufacture of rifles, for which there is a good market among the Kurds of the neighbourhood. The model for these weapons is the Martini-Peabody American patent, but the bore is that of the Russian Berdan rifle, and the cartridges used have been of Russian manufacture. OneCOMMERCE AKD INDUSTRY 229 craftsman constructs the barrels (spirally welded strips of sheet-iron), anothei the locks and springs, a third puts together and browns the arms, and an agent sells them, the cheapest for the dearest for £T4. These rifles are fairly reliable up to 500 yards. They can be turned out at the rate of about 9,000 a year. Mining. The only important mines that have been recently woiked in this area are the copper-mines at Arghana Ma'den about 45 miles NW. of Diarbekr. In 1907 there were three shafts, two of which (called Sejak and Serhosh) were the property of the Government, while the third (called Lam) belonged to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. The Government shaft ' Serhosh', which was the only one working, was leased to the inhabitants of Arghana Ma den, who are mostly Greeks and Armenians. The ore was mined with hand-picks and blasted with native powder made at Egil. Wood-fuel brought from the neighbouring hills was used in the smelting furnaces. Between 1900 and 1906 the yearly average of copper produced was 2,350,000 lb., and the average estimated value of the output was about .£36,500. In 1913 the export of copper from Diarbekr (presumably from these mines) was valued at £35,700. The ill produce went to the United Kingdom. It has been stated that not long before the war the mines were closed down owing to the exhaustion of the supply of wood-fuel on which they depended ; but it has been reported recently that they are now being worked' and that modern machinery has been ordered for them. Coal is worked at Nasaleh in the neighbourhood of Kufri (Sala- hiyeh). Small quantities, of poor quality, were obtained here before the war, but the Turks recently developed the workings and seem to have obtained in 1916 a fair quality of coal at the rate of 40-50 tons a day. Some of the coal, iron, and lead deposits in the hill-country of upper Mesopotamia (see pp. 57-8) have been worked intermittently on a small scale. Quarrying.—-The principal quarrying industry is that of the Mosul district. Fursh, a soft bluish marble, is exported thence to Baghdad. Oil and Pitch Production. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company holds a concession which gives it the exclusive right to bore for oil in Persia except in the northern provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazan- deran, Astarabad, and Khorasan. When the Turco-Persian frontier was delimited in 1914 certain petroliferous areas in the Mandali Khanikin—Qasr-i-Shlrln region were transferred from Persia to Turkey; but the Turkish Government confirmed the rights of the j company on the transferred territory. The British Government,230 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY in view of the importance of securing a controlled supply for the needs of the Royal Navy, has invested largely in the company, and in consideration of this financial support arrangements have been made which give the Government the supervision of the Company's general policy and of the further development of the concession. (а) Production in Ardbistan. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's producing field is at Maidan-i-Naftun 26- 30 miles SSE. of Shushtar. At Maidan-i-Naftun an area of about 3-| square miles was proved by 1918. The wells drilled here have so far given an abundant yield, and prospects of further development are good. Some promising areas have been found in the neighbourhood. A 10-in. pipe-line carries oil from the Maidan-i-Naftun field to the refinery at Abbadan on the Shatt el-Arab. At the beginning of the war the Abbadan refinery had storage for 60,000 tons of crude oil and 50,000 tons of refined oil; but the storage capacity has since been increased, and further considerable extensions were in progress at the end of 1917. The native labour employed by the company is mainly Lur. There is some insignificant collection of oil by natives near Maidan- i-Naftun, at Mesjid-i-Suleiman (where the wells are exploited by the Seyyids of Shushtar), and at Shardan near Ramuz. The oil thus obtained is used chiefly for anointing camels against the mange. (б) Production in Turkish Territory of Kirmanshah. —The places on Turkish territory where oil was more or less regularly obtained are Mandali (Neft Khaneh), Chlah Surkh, Abu Sarkal (near Tuz Khurmatli), Kirkuk, and Kaiyara. There seems to have been some collection (possibly intermittent) of oil at Zakho. The Chlah Surkh and Neft Khaneh wells were in Persian territory until the delimitation of the frontier in 1914, when they were transferred to Turkey, the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the ceded areas being preserved. On the Persian side of the present frontier, in the province of Kirmanshah, the Kurds collect oil in places, e. g. at Imam Hasan E. of Khanikin. Up to 1914 the Chlah Surkh wells were worked on a small scale by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Turkish Government leased wells on its territory to contractors. Elsewhere than at Chlah Surkh oil was collected in skins and transported to local refineries by donkeys. There were stills, where refining was carried on by primitive pro cesses, at Kirkuk, Tuz Khurmatli, Mandali, and Kaiyara. Production was on a very small scale. The Mandali springs yielded about 500 gallons a day: those at Kirkuk and Abu Sarkal about 130 and 150 gallons respectively. (On the prospects of the Neft Khaneh field near Mandali see p. 60.) The oil produced was used for lighting, for lubrication, and as a medicine for camel-mange.COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 231 Pitch is obtained at Hit, where there are five bitumen springs, or groups of springs, four on the right bank of the Euphrates, one on the left. In 1909 four of these were being worked and were said to be capable of yielding altogether over 2,000 donkey-loads a day; much less was actually collected. The methods of collection and preparation were primitive. The bitumen is used for pitching boats, bridges, floors, &amp;c. Lack of transport has confined the sale of bitumen to the local Mesopotamian market. On the possibilities of the Hit district as an oil-producing area see p. 61. Miscellaneous. [a) Minor Handicraft —Pottery is manufactured throughout the country, though a certain amount is imported from abroad ; the pottery of Baghdad, very light and porous, is sold throughout Irak. Much matting is produced in Irak, especially by the marsh Arabs. A number of crafts are specially practised by the Persians of Irak, e.g. at Kazimain house-decorating and painting, and the manufacture of small objects of ivory, wood, and tortoise-shell. At Kerbela filigree work in the precious metals and engraving on mother-of-pearl are executed, and here and at Nejef are made rosaries and praying tablets which, like the inscribed shrouds mentioned above, find a sale among Shiah pilgrims. {b) Distilling.— -Arag^ is distilled at Qarareli three miles south of Baghdad, and an inferior quality is made at Hilla. In the first half- year of the British occupation of Baghdad the Government monopoly for the sale of araq in the city and surrounding districts brought in £16,000. The spirit is made from dates together with mastic, orange-peel, cardamoms, and other ingredients. (c) Dried Fruit. —There is a dried-fruit industry which is said to contain possibilities of development. [d] Milling is a fairly important industry in some towns, but modern machinery has not been used, except to a slight extent at Baghdad and Basra. (e) Wool-pressing is carried on at Baghdad, Basra, Kut el-Amara, and Amara. (/) Gypsum-mortar is manufactured in considerable quantities at Mahmudiyeh (between Baghdad and Museyib), and at Zobeir near Basra. (g) Collection of Salt. —Salt is collected for local use from some of the large fields of Irak and the Jezlreh (see p. 58). The fields have been Turkish Government property, and the right of supplying the pro duce to the larger towns was leased to contractors; otherwise the Arabs seemed to have helped themselves as they pleased. The produce of the fields in the Sairt district (south of Bitlis) was ex ported to neighbouring vilayets.282 COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY {h) Collection of Galls : Digging —Galls are collected by the tribes of the Kurdish hill-country and brought to market at Mosul, Rowanduz, and elsewhere. (On their export see p. 224.) New season galls begin to come into Mosul about the middle of July, and the supply continues until October. Good crops follow severe winters. On the distribution of the liquorice root see p. 64. In some parts of the country where liquorice grows (e .g. in Arabistan) it has been found impossible to gather the root owing to difficulties of labour and transport. Digging has taken place round Mosul and in Irak as far down as Kut el-Amara on the Tigris and Diwaniyeh on the Euphrates. Women's labour is largely employed. The digging is carried on chiefly in winter. The root takes about four months to dry, and in the process loses about 60 per cent, of its weight. It is then hydraulically pressed into bales at Basra. (On its export see p. 224.) Messrs. MacAndrews, Forbes &amp; Co., who have practically the whole industry in their hands, have been accustomed to lease the ground on which the root is dug, and have also paid a tax on it to the Turkish Government.CHAPTER XIII CUKRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Currency and Exchange Baghdad and Basra Turkish Currency.— Before the war the Turkish coinage in Irak was not enough for the needs of the country and had to be supple mented by foreign coins, chiefly Indian and Persian. Since 1914 the circulation of Turkish coins in the area occupied by the British has become unimportant, the principal currency being the Indian coinage and notes introduced by the Expeditionary Force. In April 1^17 it was reported that Turkish coinage had been practically eliminated, Turkish lirahs circulating in bazaars, but not to any great extent. The Turkish lirah, or pound (&lt;£T), has an intrinsic value of about 18s. 0|d, and before the war was ordinarily taken as approximately equivalent to 185. The par of exchange was 110 per cent. f£TI10 = £100 sterling). In the calculation of sums of money the is resolved into piastres. In Irak before the war there were several different valuations of the piastre, which were used in different kinds of transactions. There are no piastre coins, although, as will be seen, two kinds of piastre practically have equivalents in the coinage (see (c) and (/) below). The varieties of the piastre were as follows : {a) The ' gold ' piastre, at 100 to the lirah. This was used for the payment of taxes and other transactions with State departments. (6) The mejidiyeh piastre, at 102-6 to the lirah. The Imperial Ottoman Bank kept its accounts partly in the gold piastre, partly in the mejidiyeh. (c) The silver or sagh piastre (also called at 108 to the lirah. This is the piastre commonly used by merchants in transac tions, partly owing to its close correspondence with the silver coin known as the qurshsagh (value about 2d.), partly for convenience of234 CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES calculation, 20 sagh piastres going to the the principal silver coin (for which see below). (d) A piastre (sometimes also called at 108-5 to the Urah, used by merchants for some purposes, such as the keeping of wholesale accounts. (e) A piastre at 155 to the lirah, used at Basra in the date trade. (/) The raij, or small, piastre (I), at 482 to the lirah. This is a quarter of the sagh piastre, and is used in retail trade. It corre sponds to the nickel coin called mit (^d.). (g) The raij, or small, piastre (II), at 414 to the lirah. This is a quarter of the piastre at 103-5 {d above). The first four of the above-mentioned piastres were sometimes known as ' big' or ' grand seigneur' piastres. In quotations of prices the sagh piastre (occasionally denoted by the letters g. was generally used. In the calculation of small sums is much used, going to the sagh piastre. There are no coins. A unit of computation used in the quotation of prices in the date market is the shami, equivalent to 5 gold piastres. There was for merly a coin of this name with a nominal value of ten gold piastres, but having been reduced after the Russo-Turkish War to the value of 5 gold piastres, which was less than the value of the metal contained in the coin, it was everywhere melted down, and has now altogether disappeared. There are five Turkish gold coins, of 5, 2|, 1, and ^ respectively. Even before the war the first two were very rarely seen, and the last infrequently. As has been mentioned above there is still a limited circulation of lirahs at the beginning of 1917 they were current at a greatly enhanced rate, about 10 per cent, above their rupee value. The principal coin is the mejidi or In cash transactions, where no special arrangement exists, 5-4 are reckoned to the lirah. The value of the mejidi in terms of piastres is as follows : 18-5 gold piastres. 19 mejidiyeh piastres at 102-6 to the lirah. 20 sagh piastres at 108 to the 19-1 piastres at 103-5 to the 80 raij piastres at 432 to the 76-6 raij piastres at 414 to the lirah. Before the war the mejidi was ordinarily reckoned as the equivalent of about 3s. 4d of English money.m CUEEENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASUEES 235 Other Turkish coins, with their approximate pre-war English values, are as follows : 1 Fulsain (5 Paras) i 2 Fulsain = 1 Qursh Eaij or Mitliq . , . = 2 Mitliqs = 1 Qamari = 1 4 Mitliqs = 1 Qursh Sagh . . , . . = 2 5 Mitliqs = 1 Euba Bashlik or Abu Khamseh. . = 2^ 8 Mitliqs = 1 Qurshain Sagh or Abu Thamaniyeh . = 4 10 Mitliqs = 1 Nasf Bashlik or Abu Ashreh . . = 5 2 Nasf Bashliks = 1 Bashlik or Euba Mejidi . . = 10 2 Bashliks = 1 Nasf Mejidi = 18 2 Nasf Mejidis = 1 Mejidi = 34 Of these the fulsain and mitliq are nickel; the ruba bashlik, and nasf bashlik alloy, and the rest silver. Before the war the ^ and i bashUk were uncommon, and the others, except the by no means plentiful. Turkish coins of the same nominal value may differ considerably in weight, &amp;c. The distinction between ' good ' and ' bad ' money varies locally: coins that would be considered ' bad' in some towns or districts will pass in others. At Baghdad lirahs and were assayed for local circulation by sarafs (see p. 206). Foreign Coinage in Irak up to 1914. —The import of foreign silver was legally forbidden, but in fact, the amount of Turkish coinage being inadequate, the use of foreign currencies was inevitable. Persian coinage was specially common, owing to the close com mercial connexion between Irak and Persia and the great numbers of Persian pilgrims who visited the country. There was little Persian gold, but much Persian silver—the double (then about 8^6?.), the (/ran (about 4^?.), the hnli-qran, the quarter-grcm, and the sittah fulus (about ^d.). A Persian copper coin, erroneously called sJicihi (worth about Tgd.), was also used. There was a large quantity of Indian silver in Irak, especially in Basra. Seizures of Indian coin were occasionally made by the Turk ish authorities. Some English, French, and Eussian gold was in circulation. Foreign Currency since 1914. —The Expeditionary Force has been financed with Indian rupees (accompanied by proportionate amounts of small copper and nickel coins) and with Indian currency notes. These found immediate acceptance, the popularity of Indian notes being specially marked, and the currency of Irak is now predomi nantly Indian. By April 1917 not only Turkish but Persian236 CUREENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES coinage had been reduced to insignificance in the occupied area in southern Irak, though Persian coins had still a small circulation in bazaars. The English equivalents of Indian coins are as follows ; 1 Pie . . . . = i Farthing. 3 Pie = 1 Pice 4 Pice = 1 Anna 16 Annas = 1 Rupee 15 Rupees 3 Id. Id. 1 5. 4:^, £1. Maria Theresa dollars [riyals, worth about 1-| rupee) were imported from Aden and Masqat for the purchase of camels in Arabia. Exchange. —The rate of exchange for the was variable ; it might fall as low as 105^ (£T105^ = &lt;£100 sterling) in the date season, and rise to 110 or higher in winter. The exchange also fluc tuated (see further below, p. 237), but in their accounts merchants used a fictitious hook-qran fixed at 344 to the The Baghdad money market was controlled by sarafs (compare p. 206). The money-changer's business was made very lucrative by the number of different coinages in circulation. Merchants wishing to dispose of their foreign money usually purchased drafts allowing coins to return to the country of their origin, these drafts having a rate of their own different from that of the coinages. Mosul Mosul has a piastre of its own, the valuation of which is as follows: 40 Mosul paras = 1 Mosul 25-| Mosul piastres = 1 137^ Mosul piastres = 1 Arabistan Currency. —The following Persian coins were current in Arabistan before the war: The siyahpul, a copper coin of variable value ; it has been known to stand at ^and of the q at the same time in different parts of Arabistan.

The following gold coins were rarely seen: the gold hazar (passed at 3^-4 gram) ; the panj ha (nominally 5 passed at 10|-11 grans) ; the ashra/i (nominally 10 qrans, passed at 20^-22 grans). There are two units of calculation (not coins) in common use : the dinar,^ of which 1,000 go to the qrun ; and the = 10 Fractions of qrans are generally expressed in or huM-qamaris. Indian and Turkish coins, as well as Mai'ia Theresa dollars, were also current. Recently the quantity of rupees in the country has greatly increased. Exchange. —The qran exchange has given serious trouble in the past few years. Before the war the exchange with the rupee was at the rate of 365—385 qrdns to Rs. 100, Soon after the beginning of the war the qran depreciated, and the rate was 425 and more. Early in 1916 the qran began to appreciate, and the process continued rapidly throughout that year. In November 1916 the rate was 250 in Arabistan; early in January 1917 it was less than 200. Then began a reaction, and in April 1917 the rate was about 260. The causes of the appreciation of the are obscure. Among them may be, first, the rise in the price of the silver ; secondly, the flooding of northern Persia with Russian paper money ; and thirdly, the curtailed coinage of new Persian currency due to the difficulty of importing silver. The appreciation was against the British interests, as mules and supplies were being purchased in south-western Persia for the Expe ditionary Force in Mesopotamia, and were being paid for in which were being bought for the purpose in large quantities. In the course of 1916 the purchase of qrans was suspended, and orders were issued that supplies were to be paid for, so far as possible, in rupees. The result has been a large increase in the number of rupees circu lating in southern Persia. Weights Baghdad. —The standards of weights vary from place to place. Even at Baghdad, the commercial capital, there is much unnecessary complication. Two systems prevail: based on the Baghdad oke {huqqeh) of 8 lb. 12 oz. 8 dr. (&amp;) based on the Con stantinople oke of 2 lb. 12 oz. 12 dr. [a) The scale of local weights is as follows:CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 239 Avoirdupois ii. Wool, gums. lb. oz. dr. Sold by maunds : 1 maund = 12f Constantinople okes . . . . , . . . = 34 15 6 (The Constantinople oke is also known as an astana in the case of this commodity.) iii. Grain, vegetables, dates. Sold by waznehs: 1 wazneh = 78 Constantinople okes 218 2 8 iv. Wood, charcoal, peas. Soldby waznehs: 1 wazneh=50 Constantinople okes = 139 13 8 (20 waznehs = 1 tag!tar in the case of wood and charcoal.) v. Metals, coffee, pepper. Sold by maunds: 1 maund = 6 Constantinople okes = 16 12 8 The French kilogram (= 2*2046 lb.) is used to a limited extent as an official measure under the name of or decimal Irnqqeli, and 100 kilograms are treated in the case of grain as equivalent to 1 wazneh. Apothecaries also employ the French kilogram with its multiples and subdivisions. The result of the multiplication of standards is that there are at least 2 kinds of waqiyeh, 3 of Imqqeh, 2 of of ivameh, and 2 of taghar in simultaneous use at Baghdad. Basra. —At Basra the local unit is a huqqeli of 2 lb. 12 oz., and the local waqiyeh — 2%huqqehs. Weighment is usually by but the number of huqqehs to the varies somewhat as follows: (а) For grain, lime, wool, and slcins 1 maund = 60 huqqehs. (б) For meat, provisions, and grocerie 1 maund = 10 huqqehs. (c) For gM : 1 maund = 50 huqqehs. (d) For dates : 1 maund = 54 huqqehs. The Basra taghar, containing 1,200 is in practice regarded as the equivalent of 1^ ton.ES CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 243 fcWi Measures Linear Baghdad.— Three systems prevail, each based upon a different dhara or 'yard'.

It will be observed from the above tables that three different charaks of length obtain at Baghdad besides the of weight and one ruba of length besides the of weight. A mason's cubit [mamar), equal to 31| in., is used chiefly by builders and for land measurement. Basra. The English yard of 36 in, is in general use, being known as dhara and subdivided into 16 aqads. But the Aleppo of 27 m. is also employed. Mosul.— The dhara at Mosul measures 31 |f in., being as elsewhere aivided into 16 aqads. Diarbekr.— The dhara here measures 29-9 in. and is also called ^arshm. It is divided into 4 charahs or 16 qirehs, which latter would appear to be synonymous with aqad. Arabistan. —The dhara (Persian varies from 32 in. at Shushtar and Eellahiyeh to 37 in. at other places. The half-yard is called nim by Persians, or nuss by Arabs; the quarter-yard is called rub or ruha, or charak. The char ah is divided into 4 qirehs. q244; CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The Gaz-i-SMh measures 4041 in. Piece-goods are measured by the English yard, or by the actual cubit (the length of a man's forearm and hand), or by the double cubit (the distance from a man's nose to the tip of his finger when the arm is extended). Distance In Turkey distances (except in so far as official measurements are made in kilometres) are calculated in hours. The official ' hour may be taken as the equivalent of 3-|-4 miles. It therefore repre sents a greater distance than can actually be covered in an hour under normal conditions by troops on the march ; and it is more than the hour's march of laden camels under any circumstances, or of other pack-animals on difficult ground (compare pp. 278-9). But ' camel hours' and ' pack-animal hours' are not infrequently used to estimate distance. In Persia the farsdkli (Arabic su'cif) is used. The is theoretically 3-87 miles, but is actually variable, being taken as the equivalent of an ' hour'. It may be considered to be about ■'&gt;2' ^ miles. Square Measure, applicable Baghdad.—The commonest unit of land measurement is the faddan, which term is here defined as ' the area which two men can cultivate', or 'asurface which can be completely sown with 500 huqqehs of wheat and 700 Iniqt /clis of barley', in all 1,200 (Constanti nople) huqqeJis. The Baghdad fad is subdivided into square jaribs, and square dharas [mamari), as follows : approximately 1 Faddan = 200 donum atik . . = 44| acres. 1 Donum atik = 1,600 sq. dhara mamari = 0-24 „ 1 sq. Dhara mamari . . . . = 6-53 sq. ft. or 1 Faddan = 18 sq. jaribs . . . = 44-| acres. 1 sq. Jarib = 2-47 „ The jarib is a measure of length, equal to 100 metres or 109 yards. In Khorasan N. of Baghdad there is a of 513 or 1234 acres, and on the Khalis canal one of 340 or 81f acres. The juft is the^area which one yoke of oxen can plough, and it varies from 70 to 100* donums (16-8 to 24 acres).CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 245 Basra. For the purpose of land or surface measurement at Basra a dhara of nearly 19 in. is employed, and 6§ = 1 gusha (about rffei; 10 ft - 2 2 in.). 20 sq. gushas (2041 ft. x 2041 ft.) = 1 jarib = 41,684^ • sq. feet = 0-95 acre. The jarib is also subdivided as follows: 1 Jarib = 10 gifiz .... = 41,684i sq. ft. 1 Gifiz = 10 esbrans . . . = 4,168^ ,, :■ 1 Esbran . . . , = 41 fU U'l ' 4 ' The dommi system prevails as far as Mosul and Diarbekr. Arabistan.— The faddan (Persian or, in the Hindlyan district, guo. a word used elsewhere on the Persian coast) is de- • • ■ scribed as the area that can be ploughed during the ploughing season by one pair of bullocks, or needs 100 Shushtar (13 cwt.) iaib: of seed to sow it. . The jarib is used in the Shatt el-Arab district. Like the Baghdad jUTib it is about 2^ acres, but is somewhat variable. It is described as accommodating 200 date-trees. (iMI Liquid, There is no standard measure for liquids, which are sold by the pot or bottle, the pots being of all sizes and the bottles generally v r reputed pints or quarts. Time The day is divided into 12 hrs., of which the 12th ends at sun set, or rather 7 mins. after. Thus, when the sun sets at 6 p.m., 7 o'clock by local time corresponds to 1 p.m. European Style. Sun set is the fixed point of reckoning for each day. At the March and September equinoxes 6 o'clock Turkish = noon. The Eastern custom of referring to a night or evening as part of the day following, rather than the day preceding, is productive of |$i much confusion: e .g. Monday night or evening means the night or evening between Sunday and Monday (cf. our Christmas Eve, Easter Eve), not Monday evening in its current modern sense. ' Monday evening' according to European idiom must be described as the evening of the day of Monday. Turkish Beckoning of Years. —Two years in use are to be distin- 513 guished: (a)The Hejira year. This is the year of the Mohammedan Era, which is calculated from July 15, 622 a. d ., the date of Mohammed's flight from Mecca.246 CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The Hejira year is lunar, consisting of 12 months and of 354 or 355 days. Every odd month (1st, 3rd, &amp;c.) has 30 days, and every even one 29, except in leap years, when the last month has 30' days. The Mohammedan cycle contains 30 years, in which the leap years are the 2nci, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 29th. To find the Christian year in which a given Hejira year begins Multiply the Hejira year by 2-977 ; divide the product by 100, and de duct the quotient from the Hejira year ; add to the result 621-569, and the result will be the Christian year in which the Hejira year begins. To find the Hejira year which begins in a given Christian year Subtract 622 from the Christian year ; multiply the result by 1-0307: cut off the last two decimals and add -46 ; if there is no surplus decimal the result will be the Hejira year; if there is a surplus decimal the result will need the addition of 1. 1st Moharrem (the first day of the Mohammedan year), 1337 a.h. = 7th October, 1918 a. d. 1st Moharrem, 1338 a.h . = 26th September, 1919 a. n. (b)The financial year. This is an official year used in the Turkish Empire for financial and other administrative purposes. It was introduced in 1789, and was intended to correspond with the Orthodox year, which is used in Russia and in other countries where the Greek Orthodox Church has been established. It begins on March 1st of the Orthodox year, or on March 14th of our year. The Turkish financial year 1334 began on March 14th, 1918. The Turkish financial year 1335 will begin on March 14th, 1919.

M ain L ines op C ommunication A. F rom the P ersian G ulp to B aghdad or N orthern A rabistan I. From the Persian B asra is the gate of Irak on this side, and the routes from the Gulf to Baghdad may be divided into the approach from the Gulf to Basra and the lines of communication between Basra and Baghdad. (a) Approach to Basra from the Gulf. The Shatt el-Arab (Fao—Basra, about 67 miles by river; Bom bay—Basra, about 1,620 miles; Aden—Basra, about 1,970 miles; Plymouth—Basra via Suez and Aden, about 6,340 miles). The Shatt el-Arab waterway is at present the only important line of communication between the Gulf and Basra. It is navigable by ocean-going steamers, but the bar at its mouth is not passable for vessels drawing more than about 20 ft. Measures are being taken to deepen the channel by dredging (see further below, p. 280). Before the war there was no port accommodation for sea-going steamers, which anchored in mid-stream, and received their cargoes by means of hagJialahs (country boats). At Magil (5 miles above Ashar Creek and the Turkish custom house) there is 1-| mile of river-bank suitable for the construction of deep-water wharves. Here wharves capable of accommodating ocean-going steamers have already been built. [Some years before the war Koweit was considered as a possible terminus for the proposed continuation of the Baghdad Railway to the Gulf. Koweit town is about 110 miles from Basra, from which it is separated by desert. It lies on the SE. side of Koweit Bay, which is about 20 miles long and about 10 miles broad. Vessels anchor in248 COMMUNICATIONS AND TKANSPORT the bay 1-3 miles from the shore and landing is by boat. The opinion that Koweit might be made the port of Irak seems to have been connected with an exaggerated idea of the difficulty of making the Shatt el-'Arab accessible to ships drawing more than 20-21 ft. It appears that the construction of the harbour works needed to make Koweit a well-equipped port would be exceedingly costly. (On the nature of the coast between Koweit and the Shatt el-'Arab see p. 29.) It appears that vessels of 20-26 ft. draught and 450 ft. length can navigate the Khor 'Abdallah and Khor eth-Tha'alab up to the Umm Qasr creek, which is about 40-45 miles across the desert from Basra. See Vol. II, Bo I, C, 23 a and b.] (6) Communications between Basra and Baghdad. The line of through communication between Basra and Baghdad at present follows the Tigris, as on the Euphrates there is no through waterway from- Basra to northern Irak that is practicable for large river-craft at all seasons. But the extension of the Baghdad Railway to Basra was planned to follow the line of the Euphrates, keeping to the edge of the Arabian Desert past the marshes of southern Irak. (i) Tigris line. (1) River-route (500 miles). This route is practicable at all seasons for craft drawing 3-| ft. See further pp. 280-2. (2) Land communications. Railways : Basra—Amara, 112 miles, metre gauge. Kut—Baghdad (about 105 miles ?), metre gauge. Road (about 350 miles): since 1915 there has been a good deal of road-construction along the banks of the Tigris, and it seems that light motors can now pass in the dry season from Basra to Baghdad. (ii) Euphrates line. (1) River-route (Basra—Hindiyeh Barrage, about 400 miles). Practicable in high water for steamers drawing about 4 ft., but in low water only small craft can pass the shallows between Kurna and Nasirlyeh and on the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh. See further pp. 282-4. (2) Land communications. Railway : Basra—Nasirlyeh, 141 miles, metre gauge ; along the border of the Arabian Desert. [The extension of the Baghdad Railway was designed before the war to pass by Museyib, Kerbela, and Nejef, and thence along the edge of the desert to Basra.] Caravan-routes and roads : Basra—Baghdad Nejef, about 420 miles ; ^ via Hilla, about 370 miles. Before the war the only roads on this line that were of much importance were those from Nejef and Hilla to Baghdad. Basra Nasirlyeh (140 miles). Desert route along southern sideCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 249 of the Euphrates Tthov, Passable for wheeled traffic (including light motor-lorries) except when the floods are out round Khamisiyeh and Nasirlyeh. Nasirlyeh—Nejef (170 or 145 miles). Either by edge of Arabian Desert throughout, or by desert-edge to Qasr Eahlm and then across Bahr-i-Nejef when dry. Easy desert route ? not known to be passable for wheels. Nasirlyeh Hilla via Samaweh (170 miles). Tracks along Hilla branch probably not at present passable for wheels. Nejef—Baghdad via Kerbela and Museyib (110 miles). Before the war this was an unmetalled road passable for carriages and light motors in dry weather and unless interrupted by severe floods, except at the pontoon bridge over the Euphrates at Museyib. The road was much used by pilgrims to Kerbela and Nejef. Hilla- Baghdad (60 miles). Railway (4 ft. 8^ in.). Road passable for carriages and light motors in dry weather and if not interrupted by floods : it joins the Museyib—Baghdad road about 30 miles from Baghdad. II. From the Persian Gulf Up to Ahwaz-Nazin the river-route is the only one of importance. (a) River-route. (i) From Fdo toAhwaz-Nazirl by Shatt el-'Arab and Karun. Fao—'Abbadan (A.P.O. Co.'s oil-refinery and terminus of pipe line), 31 miles; Fao—Mohammareh, 46 miles (Basra—Mohammareh, 22 miles); Mohammareh—Nazirl, about 110 miles. On the Shatt el-Arab see p. 280. The Mohammareh anchorage for ocean-going vessels is in that river. The Karun up to Nazirl is navigable for vessels of 5-6 ft. draught except in low water, when vessels drawing 3| ft. may find difficulty within 20 miles of Nazirl. The Ahwaz-Nazirl rapids practically block navigation. Goods are unloaded at Nazirl, and transported by tram to a point above the rapids, about 1-| mile upstream. (ii) Almas — Shaleili (about 70 miles). Practicable for shallow-draught steamers. Shaleili is on the Ab-i- Gargar branch of the Karun about 7^ miles below Shushtar, and 4-5 miles above Dar-i-Khazineh, whence a cart-road leads to Maidan- i-Naftun.250 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT (&amp;) Land communications. The alluvial plains along the lower Karun can be traversed easily, when dry, by pack-animals and light carts, but become impracticable after heavy rain or when the floods are out. When the ground is dry light motors can travel from Marid, on the left bank of the Karun 8 miles above Mohammareh, to Ahwaz (58 miles); from Ahwaz to Shushtar (65 miles), crossing the Ab-i- Gargar by the Band-i-Qlr boat-bridge; and from Ahwaz to Shush (75 miles). From Ahwaz to the Maidan-i-Naftun oil-field there are two roads : (i) Via Band-i-Qlr and Dar-ivKhazineh (82 miles); a cart-track, but at Dar-i-Kbazineh where the Ab-i-Gargar is crossed there is neither bridge nor ford. (ii) Via Abgungi (about 69 miles) ; passable for carts to Abgungi, thence a good pack-road. Water scarce from mile 24, where the track leaves the Karun. B. From the Direction of Syria to Baghdad As the Syrian Desert (see p. 21) is a bar to direct communication between Irak and southern or central Syria, the main routes to Baghdad on this side enter Mesopotamia in the upper part of the middle Euphrates valley. Two sets of routes may be distinguished : those which having entered the Euphrates valley follow it down to Fellujeh W. of Baghdad, and those which strike across upper Mesopotamia and pass round by Mosul. To the first of these groups belong the road and river-routes from Aleppo to Baghdad the Euphrates valley; to the second belongs the line of communication already partly covered by the Baghdad Railway (Aleppo—Jerablus Nisibin—Mosul—Samarra—Baghdad). [Distances from Aleppo or Damascus to the Syrian coast are: Aleppo—Alexandretta, by rail {via Toprak Qal'ah), 135 miles. Aleppo—Suedia, by road, 89 miles. Aleppo—Latakiyeh, by road, 100 miles. Aleppo—Tripoli, by rail, via Homs, 188 miles. Damascus—Beirut, by rail, via Rayak, 92 miles. Damascus—Haifa, by rail, via Derat, 178 miles.] I. The Euphrates (a) Aleppo—Baghdad. (i) Land -route. Aleppo—Baghdad road (527 miles) Meskeneh (57 miles), Deir ez-Zor (205 miles), Anah (340 miles), Hit (424 miles), Fellujeh(in) COMMUNICATIONS AND TKANSPORT 251 (483 miles). The Euphrates is crossed by a boat-bridge at Fellujeh. The road is practicable for motor-traffic. Railway: Fellujeh— Baghdad (4 ft. 8^in.); and line under construction from Fellujeh up Euphrates valley. (') River-route. Meskeneh (57 miles by road from Aleppo)—Fellujeh, 570 miles. Jerablus (74 miles by rail from Aleppo)—Fellujeh, 650 miles. Birijik (about 80 miles byroad from Aleppo)—Fellujeh, 590 miles. Apart from a few occasions on which shallow-draught steamers or motor-launches have made the journey between Meskeneh and Fellujeh, this route has been used by which navigate downstream only, and are towed back empty. See further p. 286 and p. 292. (b) Damascus—Baghdad via Tadmor and Deir ez-Zor (about 610 miles). From Damascus to Deir ez-Zor (about 290 miles) there is a fairly easy and well-watered route across desert or steppe. From Deir ez-Zor the Aleppo—Baghdad road is followed. [Until 1912 a camel-post used to follow a direct route across the desert between Damascus and Hit; but this route, owing to scarcity of water, is suitable only for riding-camels. Damascus—Baghdad Hit, about 490 miles.] II. Routes from Aleppo to via In the past the usual caravan-route from Aleppo to Mosul avoided the steppes of the Jezlreh, principally because of their insecurity; between the Euphrates and Mardln it made a detour to north by Diarbekr, and again between Nisibin and Mosul it passed east of the Tigris by Jezlret-ibn-'Omar and Zakho. Similarly the main land- route from Mosul to Baghdad skirted the edge of the Kurdish hills by Erbil, Altun Koprii, Kirkuk, and Kufri, and avoided the shorter way by the Tigris valley, which from a few miles below Mosul down to Tekrit was empty of settled inhabitants and was dominated by the Sham mar. In recent times the shorter ways between Aleppo and Mosul and between Mosul and Baghdad have been coming into use, and the trace of the Baghdad Railway does not follow the detours above mentioned. (a) Line of the Baghdad Railway (Aleppo—Baghdad, about 640- 650 miles by rail and road). (i) Aleppo— Nisibin. By rail, about 277 miles; Jerablus (Euphrates bridge ; 74 miles) and Ras el-'Ain (203 miles).252 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT (ii) Nisibin— Mosul. By direct road across steppe Demir Kapu Khan and Kesik Koprti ?), passable for motors in dry weather, about 130 miles. Water scarce in summer; it appears that wells have lately been sunk at some of the halting-places. Railway con struction in progress. (iii) Mosul—Samarra. By road, on right bank of Tigris, passable for motors, about 165 miles. (Railway under construction; see p. 263.) By river, about 190 miles. Keleks (large rafts on inflated skins) navigate downstream only, taking 2-|-ll days: see further p. 287. (iv) Samarra— Baghdad. By rail, 74 miles. By river, 105 miles. Keleks take 1-4 days. Steamers drawing about 4 ft. can ascend to Samarra in a high river: see further p. 287. (fc) Caravan-route via Diarbekr, Mardin, Mosul, and Kirkuk (750- 800 miles by road). This route has a number of variations between Aleppo and Mosul. (i) Aleppo— Diarbekr (250-230 miles). Passable for wheels. The Euphrates has been usually crossed at Birijik (by ferry), but in the years preceding the war more southerly crossings (Jerablus, Tel Ahmar) were coming into use for caravans bound for Urfeh. From Birijik there is a road to Severek and Diarbekr Hovek ; another route passes by Urfeh and joins the more direct road between Hovek and Severek. Aleppo—Diarbekr Birijik and Urfeh, about 250 miles ; via Birijik and Hovek, about 230 miles; Jerablus and Urfeh, 240 miles ; via Tel Ahmar and Urfeh, about 235 miles. [From Urfeh a direct route leads to Mardin by Veiran Shehr (about 110 miles). This is about 65 miles shorter than the detour from Urfeh to Mardin via Diarbekr, but the road is not practicable through out for wheels; it is in parts poorly supplied with water, and as it leads through the Milli country it is insecure.] (ii) Diarbekr — Mosul. (1) Land-route via Nisibin. Diarbekr—Nisibin via Mardin (95 miles). Road passable for wheels. [A Decauville Railway is reported to run from Tel Helif (on the Baghdad Railway about 24 miles W. of Nisibin) in the direction of Diarbekr. It appears to have reached a point some miles on the Diarbekr side of Mardin. There is a broad-gauge line from Derbesiyeh Station (on the Baghdad Railway between Ras el-Ain and Tel Helif; see p. 262 below) to a point a few miles S. of Mardin. From Diarbekr a pack-road leads across the Tur Abdin by Midiat to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. It is about 140-145 miles by this route fromCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT im ''-v ...yf 253 Diarbekr to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, or 20-15 miles shorter than by the route via Nisibin.] Nisibin—Mosul (170-180 miles). On the direct route from Nisibin to Mosul Demir Kapu Khan (about 130 miles) see above, p. 262, B II (ii). There is a caravan-route from Nisibin to Mosul Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar (bridge over Tigris), Zakho (bridge over Khabur), and the Zakho Pass across the Jebel Abyadh to Mosul (170 miles). It is not passable for wheels throughout. Another route goes by Feishkhabur (ferry over Tigris) and joins the Zakho—Mosul road at Simel (total distance about 145 miles). This is passable for wheels between Nisibin and Feishkhabur. (2) River-route. About 335 miles. Downstream traffic only. Rafts are said to take 4-20 days. (iii) Mosul—Baghdad. On the direct route by the right bank of the Tigris (about 240 miles) see above, p. 252, B II (a) (iii)-(iv). Route via Erbil, Altun Koprti, Kirkuk, and Kufri (about 295 miles). Passable for wheels. Before the war wheeled vehicles had to be ferried across the Zabs. The Turks have now a temporary bridge on the Great Zab, and apparently another on the Lesser Zab. The stone bridge over the latter river at Altun Kopru is impracticable for vehicles. From this route branch roads leading to the Kurdish highlands and across the Persian frontier. See pp. 274-5 below. ✓ (c) Aleppo—Mosul via Deir ez-Zor, Tel es-Sawwar (or Shedadi), Ain el-Ghazal (or Beled Sinjar), and Tel Afar. About 400 miles. The route by Tel es-Sawwar and 'Ain el-Ghazal is passable for light wheeled vehicles. The Aleppo—Baghdad road is followed down the Euphrates valley to Deir ez-Zor, where there is a stone bridge across the river, believed to have been completed since the war. There are ferries across the Khabur at Tel es-Sawwar and Shedadi. Water is scarce in summer on the steppe between the Euphrates and Tigris. [Damascus—Mosul via Deir ez-Zor, about 600 miles. Compare B 1 (b) above.] C. Feom the Direction op Anatolia and Armenia The ranges of the Taurus here form a barrier across which there are at present only a few routes of any importance.254 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT I. Routes from Anatolia entering of the Euph (а) The line of the Baghdad Railway. Haidar Pasha—Baghdad, about 1,520 miles. The railway had not been completed at the beginning of 1918. (i) Haidar Pasha—Jer alius via Konia and Aleppo, 950 miles. Baghdad Railway. At the end of 1917 the tunnels in the Taurus south of Kara Punar (645 miles from Haidar Pasha) were apparently not yet pierced for standard gauge, but a narrow-gauge line was working here. There was a motor-road across the gap in the standard-gauge line (Kara Punar—Geldek ?). (ii) Jerablus—Nisibin ; by railway, about 200 miles. (iii) Nisibin— Samarra via Mosul; by road, passable for motors, about 300 miles (for railway N. of Samarra see p. 263) ; or by river from Mosul, see p. 287. (iv) Samarra— Baghdad ;by railway, about 74 miles. (б) By the Baghdad Railway and the Euphrates valley. (i) By railway to Jerablus, and thence by river to Pellujeh (Jerablus—Pellujeh, 650 miles, 12-45 days by shakhtur; compare pp. 251, 286). (ii) By railway to Aleppo and thence by road Meskeneh and the Euphrates valley to Pellujeh (Aleppo—Baghdad, 527 miles; compare pp. 251, 286). (c) Ad ana—Jerablus or Meskeneh, by road. There may be now communication for wheeled traffic between Adana and Killis or Aleppo via the Hasan Beyli Pass in the Amanus. From Killis to Jerablus there was before the war a pack-road that could easily have been made passable for wheels ; and from Aleppo to Meskeneh there is a motor-road. [Before the war there was a road from Adana to Birijik the Baghcheh Pass in the Amanus and c Aintab (about 170 miles). It was not passable for wheels in the Amanus.] (d)From the direction of Malatia there appears to be a moderately easy way across the Taurus by Pelvereh and the valley of the Aq Su. This is followed by the route from Malatia to Mar'ash (before the war a half-completed chaussee) and to 'Aintab Belveren or Mar'ash), Killis, and Aleppo ; from which places the Euphrates is easily acces sible by roads which either are passable for wheels or could easily be made so (e. g. Mar'ash—Samsat (Euphrates ferry) —Urfeh ; 'Aintab— Birijik; 'Aintab—Jerablus; Killis—Jerablus; Aleppo—Meskeneh). [From Albistan to Mar'ash, and from Malatia to Adiaman (in theCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 255 direction of Samsat), and to Kiakhta (in the direction of Gerger), there are more or less difficult tracks for pack-animals. From Kharput to Gerger and Samsat along the Euphrates there is only a difficult mountain-track. The Euphrates is not ordinarily used as a waterway from Armenia to Mesopotamia, since, though downstream navigation by is possible from Erzingan on the Prat Su, and from a point 3 or 4 hours above Palu on the Murad Su, there are difficult and dangerous rapids in the stretch where the river breaks through the Taurus, between Kumur Khan and Chunkush ferry.] II. Routes crossing the Taurus betwee Lake In the Taurus ranges between the Euphrates and Lake Van there are two principal gates giving access to Mesopotamia from the north, the Arghana Pass north-west of Diarbekr and the Bitlis Pass north east of Diarbekr. Besides these there are a number of other ways across the mountains, of which the most important appear to be Mush—Hazro or Zokh via the Kulp valley and the Chabakchur plain—Lijjeh via Pechar. Of the main routes which enter our area in this region all but one meet at Diarbekr. The exception is the route from Bitlis to Mosul via Sairt and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. The distances to Baghdad given below under routes (a)-(e) are calculated by Diarbekr, Mardln, Nisibin, and the trace of the Baghdad Railway. Compare B II (&amp;) ii and ii-iv. (a) Sivas—Diarbekr via Malatia, Kharput, and the Arghana Pass (290 miles). Chaussee. [Sivas—Baghdad, about 760 miles. Samsun—Sivas—Baghdad, about 980 miles. Angora—Sivas—Baghdad, by Angora—Sivas chaussee, about 1,040 miles; by a more direct route between Angora and Vozgad, on which a narrow-gauge railway has been begun, about 1,010 miles.] (h) Kaisarieh—Diarbekr via Albistan, Malatia, Kharput, and the Arghana Pass (about 340 miles). Road, passable for wheels except between Albistan and Malatia. [Kaisarieh—Baghdad, about 810 miles.] (c) Erzerum—Diarbekr via Mush, Bitlis, Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani, Zokh, the Batman Bridge, and FarqTn (about 300 miles). From Mush to Bitlis passable for wheels ; from Bitlis to Ziyaret Wa iz el Qur'ani256 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT pack-road, difficult before the war. From Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani to Diarbekr there is an unfinished chaussee. From Zokh to Diarbekr there is a route via the Desht-i-Keri and Ermi, which is about 20 miles shorter than that by the Batman Bridge and Farqln ; but the ford by which it crosses the Batman is impassable in flood. [Erzerum—Baghdad, about 770 miles.] [d] Erzerum—Diarbekr via Mush and Hazro (about 230 miles). It was reported in 1916 that a road for wheels was under construc tion between Mush and Hazro; this may follow the Kulp valley route, which before the war was a mule-track. [Erzerum—Baghdad, about 700 miles.] (e) Erzerum—Diarbekr via Oghnat, the Chabakchur plain, and Lijjeh (about 200 miles). This was not passable for wheels before the war, but was used as a summer-route by mule-caravans. During the war it has been followed by infantry. [Erzerum—Baghdad, about 670 miles.] (/) Bitlis—Mosul via Sairt and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar (about 220 miles). This road, which passes by the Bitlis, Bohtan, and Tigris valleys to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, was not passable for wheels before the war. On the roads from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Mosul see p. 253. Approximate distances to Baghdad by this route to Mosul and thence by Samarra are: Erzerum—Baghdad, about 616 miles. Trebizond—Erzerum—Baghdad, about 550 miles. [Less important routes across the Taurus between the Euphrates and Lake Van are the mule-tracks from Palu to Haini and Lijjeh, and track (not passable for wheels, but apparently fairly easy for pack-animals) from Kharput to Chermuk Pusherto (for Severek or Diarbekr). East of Lake Van the very difficult mountain-country of central Kurdistan is crossed by no important route from eastern Armenia. The track from Van to Mosul via Bash Qal'ah, Julamerk, and Amadiyeh is in parts very difficult even for pack-animals.] D. From the Persian Plateau to Mesopotamia and Akabistan Mesopotamia and Arabistan are separated from the Persian plateau by a barrier of mountains which greatly impedes communication. By far the most important approach on this side is the route from Kirmanshah to Baghdad, which runs through the depression in the barrier by Qasr-i-Shlrln and Khanikin,COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOET 257 I. Kirmanshah — Baghd via Khanihin About 220 miles. A great trade-route. Eailway, Baghdad—Khani- kin, about 94 miles ; metre gauge. Eoad passable for wheels, except after heavy snow or rain in winter. [Tabriz—Baghdad via Bijar, Sain Qal'ah, and Kirmanshah, about 565 miles. This follows the main caravan-route from Tabriz to Kirmanshah, which is passable for camel-transport, and has been used by Persian artillery. Tabriz—Baghdad via Sakiz, Senna, and Kirmanshah, about 530 miles. Tehran—Baghdad via Hamadan and Kirmanshah, about 520 miles. Passable for wheels except after heavy snow or rain in winter.] II. Routes North of the Main — None of these is passable for wheels throughout. The principal are: (а) Urmia—Mosul via Ushnu, Jildigan, Shinawa (Lahjan plain), the Giru-i-Sheikh Pass, Eayat, Eowanduz (about 220 miles). From Shinawa to Eowanduz (about 90 miles from Mosul) and perhaps as far as Baba Chichek (about 63 miles from Mosul) this route is fit for pack-animals only, and is liable to be blocked by snow in winter. It was used for a move on Urmia by Khalil Bey in the summer of 1915. [The road from Ushnu to Eowanduz by the Kelishin Pass is some 16-20 miles shorter than that by the Oiru-i-Sheikh Pass, but it is more difficult. Tabriz—Mosul via Ushnu and Eowanduz, about 315 miles. Tabriz—Mosul via Suj Bulaq, Shinawa, and Eowanduz, about 300 miles.] (б) Urmia—Eaniyeh (for Altun Koprii and Baghdad, or Erbil and Mosul) via Ushnu, Jildigan, the Lahjan plain, the Wazneh Pass, and Derbend (about 150 miles). Between the Lahjan plain and Eaniyeh this route is fit for pack-animals only. Liable to be blocked by snow in winter. [Eaniyeh—Baghdad via Altun Koprii and Kufri, about 270 miles ; passable for wheels, or could be made so without difficulty. Eaniyeh—Baghdad via Altun Koprii, the Lesser Zab, and Tigris. By road to Altun KSprii (about 65 miles), and thence by Eaniyeh—Mosul via Erbil, about 115 miles ; passable for wheels.] (c) Banah—Eaniyeh via Ser Desht (about 135 miles). Pack-road from Ser Desht (mile 35). M®S. I R258 COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPORT (d) Banah—Suleimaniyeh (for Mosul or Baghdad), ? 75 miles. Pack-road, used by infantry in the winter of 1916-17, [Suleimaniyeh—Baghdad via Kirkuk and Kufri, about 255 miles. Fit for wheels throughout if the report (May 1918) of the recent improvement of the Suleimaniyeh—Kirkuk road is correct. Suleimaniyeh—Baghdad via Zagirmeh Pass and Kufri, about 190 miles. Pack-road from Suleimaniyeh to Kufri (70 miles); Kufri—Baghdad, passable for wheels. Suleimaniyeh—Mosul via Kirkuk, about 175 miles. Passable for wheels, perhaps throughout, at any rate from Kirkuk.] (e) Senna—Suleimaniyeh via Penjevin (about 140 miles). Pack- road. (/) Senna—Suleimaniyeh via Tavala. Pack-road, reported to be used by an annual caravan from Suleimaniyeh to Tabriz. (g) Kirmanshah—Suleimaniyeh via Halebjeh (about 170 miles). Pack-road. III. Routes South of the Main — Boad Between the main Kirmanshah—Baghdad route and the Persian Gulf the least difficult part of the mountain-barrier seems to lie somewhat west of a direct line between Khurramabad and Dizful. It is traversed by the routes mentioned under (c) below. (а) Kirmanshah—Baghdad via Mandali (about 215 miles). Pack- road diverging from main route at Khorasabad about 46 miles from Kirmanshah. (б) Kirmanshah—Kut el-Amara Deh Bala (200 miles). This route, which leads through the Pusht-i-Kuh, is suitable for pack- transport only. (c) Khurramabad—Dizful (115-175 miles). There are a number of routes suitable for pack-transport between these places, the easiest of which appear to be that by Ab-i-Sard, Valmian, and Ab-i-Tirada (152 miles, making a detour to west, but keeping east of the Kashgan river), and the longer detours by Pul-i-Madian Rud and Pul-i-Kurr-o- Dukhtar or Pinjreh (165 or 175 miles). There is a fairly direct caravan-route via Ab-i-Sard, Ser-i-Gul, and Ab-i-Tirada (115 miles). On the projected railway from Mohammareh to Khurramabad Dizful see p. 267,COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 259 {d) Isfahan—Ahwaz (Lynch Road) Kavarukh, Du Pulan. and Malamir (about 295 miles). Pack-road, very difficult on a section of about 100 miles through the Bakhtiyari mountains. The Bazuft and Karun rivers are crossed by suspension bridges (steel wire and iron) built by Messrs. Lynch. A new and considerably easier alignment for a road from Isfahan to the Arabistan plains has recently been discovered. It lies some way S. of the Lynch Road, than which it is about 20 miles longer. It is believed that the construction of a motor-road on this line would not be difficult. (e) Shiraz—Ahwaz via Behbehan (about 300 miles). Prom Shiraz to Behbehan there is a track for pack-caravans which is not much used on account of the insecurity of the country. Prom Behbehan to Ahwaz there is a route via Ramuz passable for wheels when the ground is dry. (/) Bushire—Ahwaz via Beni Ismail or Bandar Dilam and Deh Mulla (? about 260 miles). This route lies over a plain throughout its course. It seems that when the ground is dry it would be pass able for wheels with some improvement at nullahs and the bridging of the Hindlyan and Jerrahi rivers. (g) Bushire—Mohammareh via Beni Ismail or Bandar Dilam, Hindlyan, BandarMa'shui', Janjlreh, and Pellahiyeh (? about 275 miles). Prom Bushire to Janjlreh (about 50 miles from Mohammareh) the ground covered by the route is apparently passable for wheels when dry; the Hindlyan would need bridging. In the Janjlreh—Pella- hlyeh district the country is much intersected by canals, and com munication between JanjTreh and the Karun is usually by boat there are said to be paths fit for pack-animals here. E. Prom the Direotiok of Arabia to Irak The main approaches to Irak from Arabia are a number of routes crossing steppe or desert, of which some, coming from Jebel Shammar (Ha'il) or Qaslm (Boreidah), strike the Euphrates at Nejef, Samaweh, or Suq esh-Shuyukh, others connect Boreidah, Riyadh, or again the coastal region of Hasa, with Basra by way of Koweit and Zobeir. On the routes between Ha'il or Boreidah and the points above mentioned on the Euphrates (routes (a)-(/) below) water is scanty and difficult of access except after rain, when pools may be met with. The only permanent wells yielding a supply sufficient for more than e 2260 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOET a small party are those at Hayyanlyeh, Hazil, Loqah, and Leinah, and others within a radius of seventy miles from Ha'il. The forage to be found is generally suitable only for camels. A limited quantity of fuel is afforded by sparse and low vegetation. No supplies are to be procured en route except such meat as may be obtainable in spring time from herdsmen near the tracks. The Hajj caravan from Nejef to Mecca passes through Ha'il. Small columns of Turkish regular troops, 2,000-4,000 strong, have marched from Nejef or from Samaweh to Ha'il (1903 and 1905); but on each occasion they had been invited by the Emir of Ha'il, who provided guidance and transport. Ha'il is connected with the Nejd (Eiyadh) by a fairly easy and well-watered route passing through Ayun el-Qaslm, Boreidah, Aneizah, and Shaqrah; some supplies at the three last- named places. The route from Boreidah via Hafar, Eiqa'i, and Koweit to Zobeir and Basra (see {g) below) presents no serious difficulties. Water is obtainable on most stages, as well as camel-grazing sufficient for a small party, and a fair amount of fuel as far as Haleibah. No supplies are to be found en route. On the route from Zilfi to Koweit (see below) water is scarce; it cannot be relied on between Artawlyeh and Safah, or between Safah and Koweit, distances of over 100 miles : there is fair grazing in places; fuel is very scarce. Zilfi is 48 miles east of Boreidah, from which it is separated by a heavy sand-desert containing some oases. Between Zilfi and Eiyadh there is a route which is good going, and on which water is never far away; supplies also could be obtained in small quantities. On the route from Hofuf through Hasa to Koweit (see (?') below) water is obtainable throughout, and is usually plentiful; forage is usually good, especially in spring ; fuel generally from bushes or brushwood ; a little wheat and barley at 'Nta. The track from Qatlf to Koweit is little frequented, traffic between these places being mostly by sea; the route is easy, and water is generally plentiful; forage is generally sufficient for a small caravan ; fuel is scarce in parts ; no supplies. From the ports of Qalif and 'Oqair routes Hofuf afford the shortest and easiest passage to the Nejd, but the country traversed is particularly unsafe. For details of the above routes see vol. ii. The following are approximate distances: (a) Ha'il—Nejef. (i) Via Hayyanlyeh and Loqah (about 357 miles). This route is now used by the Hajj and good caravans.COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPOKT 261 [Mecca—Nejef via Ha'il, about 836 miles. Medina—Nejef via Ha'il, about 632 miles.] (ii) The Darb Zobeideh via Sha'ibah, Trobah, Bli- Beleghbiyeli, Birket Ashabah (or'Asbshar), Birket ez-Zebalab, Birket el-Jumeimeh (about 403 miles). This, the old route, passing about 40 miles west of (i). It is provided with wells and tanks at regular intervals, but water is scarce, the rain not being sufficient to fill the reservoirs, and the Hajj now follows the Hayyanlyeh route as safer and more direct. (An alternative route diverges from near Trobah, and makes a detour to east via Khadrah, Leinah, and Selman wells, and rejoins the Darh Zobeideh about 40 miles south of Nejef.) (iii) Via Hazil and Blr Samlt (? about 377 miles). For most of its length this way passes west of the Hayyanlyeh route. (6) Boreidah—Nejef. (i) Via Ha'il, Hayyaniyeh, and Loqah (about 505 miles). (ii) Via Blr Zerud, Hayyanlyeh, and Loqah (about 476 miles). [ Kiyadh—Nejef via Boreidah and Hail, about 740 miles. Kiyadh—Nejef via Boreidah and Blr Zerud, about 701 miles. Mecca—Boreidah, about 480 miles.] (c) Ha'il—Samaweh, by the Darh to Blr Beleghbiyeh, thence to Leinah wells, and along the by the Selman wells (about 344 miles). [d) Boreidah—Samaweh via Ayun el-Qaslm, Quseibah, Leinah wells, and the Barb Selman (about 365 miles), [Kiyadh—Samaweh via Boreidah, about 600 miles. Mecca—Samaweh via Boreidah, about 845 miles.] (e) Ha'il—Suq esh-Shuyukh via Blr Beleghbiyeh and Leinah wells, thence by the wells of Umm Amarah, Unsab, Ohubbah and Arkamlyeh, and by Qasr Blr Shagrah (about 390 miles). {f)Boreidah—Suq esh-Shuyukh, as by to Leinah wells, and thence as by (e), about 390 miles. {g) Boreidah—Basra via Hafar, Eiqa i, Koweit, and Zobeir (about 460 miles). (The alternative route from Hafar to Koweit via Abul Hiran is of about the same length as that via Kiqa'i. From Kiqa'i to Zobeir there is a direct route which is about 70 miles shorter than that by Koweit, but it is waterless.)COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPOET 268 Station buildings between Jerablus and Tel Abiyadh are said to be made of concrete brick owing to the cost of stone. The Jerablus railway bridge across the Euphrates is 892 yards long and consists of 10 spans with an overhead lattice girder. The breadth of the bridge is 20 ft. (15 ft. for railway, 4 ft. for pathway). The foundations are of cement concrete lowered into a water-tight iron casing made of interlocking piling 45 ft. X 20 ft. in plan. The top of this piling is at low-water level, above which the pier is of smaller section. The concrete goes right up to the bed-plate of the bridge, and is stone-faced. In the sandy bed of the river the concrete goes down to a depth of 43f ft. (13 metres); elsewhere it is on rock foundations. An earth bank with a stone-wall foundation has been made on the right bank of the Euphrates above the bridge, to prevent the river floods from damaging the railway bank west of the bridge. As regards other bridges on this section of the Baghdad Eailway, the only available information is as follows : Between Arab Punar and Kharab Nas there are apparently 3 plate- girder bridges over the Qaramush. Between Tel Hamud and Eas el-Ain there is reported to be a lattice-girder bridge 66 yds. long over the Jirjib Chai. Branch Lines: (1) Derbesiyeh—Mardln. A broad-gauge line is reported to run from Derbesiyeh to the neighbourhood of Mardln. Its northern terminus is apparently 4 miles S. of Mardln town. Length, 14 miles. (2) From Tel Helif in the direction of Diarbekr. A Decauville railway is reported to run from Tel Helif towards Diarbekr. It apparently extends to a point a few miles beyond Mardln.

II. Hallways Projected (а) Completion of the Baghdad Railway between Nisibin and Samarra (about 287 miles). The line is planned to run direct from Nisibin to Mosul Demir Kapu Khan and Kesik Kopru, and from Mosul to Samarra down the right bank of the Tigris via Tekrit. Nisibin—Mosul, about 123 miles. Mosul—Samarra, about 164 miles. It appears that in the first half of 1918 work was in progress on formation levels between Nisibin and Demir Kapu Khan, about 43 miles ESE. of Nisibin. (б) Extension of the Baghdad Railway to Basra. This extension was projected to run as follows : El-Baj (Euphrates crossing upstream of Museyib); thence across desert to Kerbela ; thence along the edge of the desert to Nejef; thence across the depression of the Bahr-i-Nejef (?) and along the edge of the desert west and south of the lower Euphrates, passing some miles south of Samaweh and Nasinyeh. Basra, about 350-370 miles from Baghdad. The line would be cheap and easy to construct. The only engineering work of any magnitude that would be needed would be the bridge over the Euphrates at El-Baj. Between Baghdad and the Euphrates this line would pass through country capable of agricultural development. It would carry the great pilgrim traffic to and from Kerbela and Nejef. Branch lines would be needed to bring it into connexion with ihe agricultural areas on the lower Euphrates. The alignment along the desert was chosen owing to difficulties of railway construction in the alluvial plain ; and between Nasirlyeh and Basra it is the only possible trace. 1 1 Another route that was proposed for a railway from Baghdad, to Basra is as follows: by the right bank of the Tigris to opposite Kut el-Amara ? thence by the right (west) side of the Shatt el-Hai to Nasiriyeh, and thence by the edge ofCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 265 It was part of the German scheme that the railway should be eventually prolonged from Basra to the Persian Gulf at Koweit, a distance of about 100 miles across desert. (c) Projected branches of the Baghdad Railway within this area : (i) To Urfeh (from Tel Abiyadh station to Urfeh via Harran is about 37 miles). This branch would serve the agricultural district of the Harran— Urfeh plain. (ii) Tel Helif—Mardln—Diarbekr—Arghana Ma'den (about 125 miles). At Arghana Ma'den the Mesopotamian railway system was to connect with the system of eastern Anatolia and Armenia. 1 (iii) Mosul—Erbil (about 37 miles). This branch would serve the agricultural districts in the Mosul— Erbil plain, which have possibilities of considerable development. (iv) Sumeikeh—Sa'diyeh—Delli 'Abbas—Khanikin (about 75 miles), and Delli 'Abbas—Tuz Khurmatli. The line to Khanikin would serve the very fertile Khalis region, and also, together with its branch to Tuz Khurmatli, the oil-fields on the Persian frontier. Moreover Khanikin lies at the natural gate from Mesopotamia into Persia, and through it runs the great Baghdad—Kirmanshah trade-route. The branch line from the Baghdad Railway to Khanikin was meant eventually to connect with a line to Tehran Kirman shah and Hamadan. (v) El-Baj (on the right bank of the Euphrates opposite Museyib)— Hit (about 110 miles). the desert south of the Euphrates to Basra. The distance from Baghdad to Nasi- riyeh, where this route meets that of the Baghdad Railway, is about 240 miles. The line would need protection from floods ; and the idea was entertained of carrying it along the protective banks which Sir William Willcocks proposed to construct, as a part of his irrigation scheme, on the right bank of the Tigris between Baghdad and Kut el-Amara, and on the right bank of the Hai. The possibility of constructing aline along the Hilla branch of the Euphrates has also been taken into consideration. 1 Projected lines of this latter system were : Samsun—Amasia—Tokat—Sivas—Kharput—Arghana Ma'den (French con cession). Kharput—Mush—-Bitlis—Van (French concession). Angora—Yozgad—Sivas (French concession). Angora—Kaisarieh—Sivas (German concession ; an extension of the Anato lian Railway Haidar Pasha—Eski Shehr-—Angora). Sivas—Erzingan—Pekerij—Erzerum (with branch Pekerij—Trebizond).266 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT (d) Proposed connexions between Baghdad and the Syrian coast or Egypt via the Euphrates valley. The following have been considered as possible lines for railway connexion between Irak and Syria : (i) Baghdad — Fellujeh — Euphrates valley — Aleppo — Alexan- dretta. The distance from Baghdad to Aleppo would be about 520 miles (Aleppo—Baghdad via the Baghdad Railway, about 625 miles). At present there is railway connexion between Aleppo and Alex- andretta via Baghcheh and Toprak Qal'ah (135 miles). The distance between Aleppo and Alexandretta, as the crow flies, is about 60 miles, but any railway construction between these points would be difficult and costly. Railway construction between Aleppo and Suedia (about 80 miles) or between Aleppo and Latakiyeh (about 100 miles) would be con siderably easier than between Aleppo and Alexandretta; and there is a French concession for a line from Aleppo to Latakiyeh. But at Suedia conditions are not at all favourable to the development of a considerable port, and Latakiyeh in this respect is very inferior to Alexandretta. Aleppo is connected with Tripoli by a standard-gauge line llama and Homs. 1 (ii) Baghdad—Fellujeh—Anah 2 —Deir ez-Zor—Palmyra—Homs —Tripoli. About 620 miles, of which about 65 miles are covered by the Homs—Tripoli line. (iii) Baghdad—Fellujeh—Anah—Abu Kemal—Palmyra—Homs —Tripoli. About 550 miles, of which about 65 are covered by the Homs— Tripoli line. This is the shortest line to the Syrian coast. (iv) Baghdad—Fellujeh—Anah—Abu Kemal—Palmyra—Damas cus—Rayak—Beirut. About 630 miles, of which about 95 are covered by the Damascus —Rayak—Beirut line. The Damascus—Beirut line has a gauge of 1-05 metre (3 ft. 5-34 in.). Between Rayak and Beirut gradients are very steep, and the rack- and-pinion system is in use. * 1 The rails of the Horns—Tripoli line were taken up in 1916 for use on the Baghdad Railway. 2 Baghdad—Anah via Fellujeh and the Euphrates valley, about 180 miles. Baghdad—Anah across the Jezlreh desert, about 160 miles.COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOKT 267 Damascus is connected with Haifa by a line Deraa (177 miles ; 1-05 metre gauge). (Baghdad—Beirut via Deir ez-Zor, Palmyra, and Damascus, about 700 miles.) (v) Baghdad—Fellujeh—Hit—Damascus—Beirut. About 590 miles, of which about 95 are covered by the Damascus —Beirut line. From Hit to Damascus this line leads straight across the country, following the former camel-post route, over very arid desert. (vi) Nejef—Cairo via Jauf, Maan, Akaba, and Suez (about 875 miles). (e) Proposed connexions between the Shatt el-Arab (Basra or Mohammareh) and northern Arabistan (Ahwaz or Dizful) and south western Persia (Isfahan, &amp;c.). (i) Mohammareh or Basra—Ahwaz or Dizful. A line to Ahwaz or Dizful from the Shatt el-Arab would be of the greatest importance for the development of Arabistan. Before the war there was a British project for a line from Moham mareh to Dizful. Two possible routes were considered : the first leaves Ahwaz to E. and passes by Kut Nahr Hashim (164 miles to Dizful); the second runs by the western bank of the Karun to Amlnlyeh, opposite Ahwaz, and thence proceeds straight to Dizful (174 miles). An alternative scheme has since been proposed which would make Basra the port of Arabistan as well as of Irak, and would therefore carry the railway serving the Karun region from Basra to Ahwaz (about 80 miles); this section would ultimately be extended to Dizful. Construction in the plains of Arabistan would be easy. (ii) Ahwaz—Isfahan. It has been reported that on the new alignment for a road from Arabistan to Isfahan, S. of the Lynch route, it might prove possible to construct a light railway. (iii) (Mohammareh—) Ahwaz—Shiraz—Bandar Abbas. Proposed before the war as a British line. 'The value of the Shiraz—Mohammareh connexion appeared to be purely strategical, but it was important to secure an option for it to block, if necessary, the possible extension of the Baghdad Eailway in this direction.' Construction in the mountains would be difficult and costly owing to the nature of the country ; opposition from the tribes of this region would be likely. (iv) Dizful—Khurramabad. It was contemplated in 1911-14 that the proposed British line268 COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPORT from Mohammareh to Dizful should be continued to Khurramabad, there to connect with a Russian line from Julfa. The object of the proposal was to obtain an entry for British trade from the Shatt el- 'Arab into western Persia alternative to the Baghdad—Kirmanshah route, which, it was then expected, would be captured by the branch of the Baghdad Railway to Khanikin. The construction of the line across the hills from Dizful to Khurramabad would be difficult and expensive. Roads and Road Transport In the absence of good made roads land traffic in Mesopotamia has been accustomed to pass from point to point by the line which circumstances might make the easiest at the time, and a caravan- route may have many possible variations great and small. It is therefore of importance for travellers to have good guides or trustworthy local information, not only in the trackless steppe or desert, but also where a number of possible tracks exist, in order that the easiest line may be followed. Reliable native information is very difficult to obtain; the native often thinks that he has an interest in misinforming the traveller, and even if he is willing to tell the truth his computations of times and distances are generally very inaccurate. Road Conim unica t ions Irak In Irak the waterways have been much more important than the roads. In general it may be said there is either too much or too little water for movement by land, which is restricted by great areas of swamp, temporary or permanent, or may be stopped after rain by morasses of mud, or is impeded by the frequent canals intersecting the country near the rivers, or, on the other hand, is hampered by lack of drinking-water in the dry steppes. The principal road com munications in the country before the war were in northern Irak, where well-used routes radiate from Baghdad. In central and southern Irak there was some local caravan traffic across the open steppes or along the paths by rivers or canals, but communications were maintained chiefly by water. Since 1914 communication for wheeled transport (at least in the dry season) has been opened up on the line of the Tigris. Along the Tigris the immediate neighbourhood of the banks is generally the driest part of the country, as, owing to the transverse slope of the ground away from the river, most of the water escaping from the Tigris bed, or spilt towards the Tigris from the Euphrates,COMMUNICATIONS AND TKANSPOET 269 or descending from the Persian hills forms lakes or marshes at some distance inland from the banks; but even the ground close to the river may become marshy in many places when the floods are at their height. It appears that where the Euphrates flows in a definite channel through the alluvial plain, as well as along the Shatt el-'Arab, analogous conditions are found. The alluvial plains are destitute of stone for metalling; this can, however, be obtained at points along the edge of the Arabian Desert (in the neighbourhoods of Hit and Samaweh and at Jebel Sinam 30 miles SW. of Basra). {a) Principal routes for wheeled traffic are : Baghdad—Nejef via Museyib and Kerbela. Baghdad—Hilla. Baghdad—Mufraz (at the head of the Mahmudiyeh canal on the Euphrates). Baghdad—Fellujeh (for Aleppo). Baghdad—Samarra (continued to Mosul). Baghdad—Delli Abbas via Baqubeh (for Kufri, Kirkuk, and Mosul). Baghdad—Khanikin via Baqubeh (for Kirmanshah). Basra—Baghdad via Kurna, Amara, and Kut el-Amara. Basra—Nasirlyeh by the edge of the desert. Nasirlyeh—Kut el-Amara by a track running some distance inland from the right bank of the Shatt el-Hai. Of these roads all but the third and the last three were much used, and under favourable conditions were practicable for wheeled transport before the war; but they were unmetalled, and after heavy rain were liable to become impassable for wheels and difficult even for pack-animals. The neighbourhood of Baghdad may be so widely inundated during the flood season that on the right bank of the Tigris the city can be approached only along the tops of bunds, while on the left bank passengers and goods coming by the Khanikin road have occasionally to be ferried across the floods to the bund protecting the city on that side. The plains of Irak, where they are not encumbered by marsh or intersected by water-cuts, and at times when the surface is dry, are usually more or less passable by light wheeled transport, and even by light motor-lorries ; but patches of soft sand may cause difficulty in places, and 1 even where the surface is good at first it soon cuts up and becomes heavy if a succession of vehicles attempt to make a track'; see further on mechanical transport in Irak p. 276. The large dry canals may in parts (e. g. the Nahrawan between 'Azlzlyeh270 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOET and the Diyaleh) serve as roads fit for motor transport; where they are fairly intact they are protected from flood by their banks and by the high level of their beds, (b) Eoutes for pack-animals. Paths fit for pack-animals (at least in the dry season) can be found in the cultivated country along the rivers and canals. There are also routes used by camel and donkey caravans across the steppes (e. g. Baghdad—Mendali, Kut el-Amara—Bedrah, Amara—Dizful, in the plains NE. of the Tigris; and between the rivers, Hilla— Bogheileh, Afaj—Bogheileh). (c) Bridges. The rivers of Irak are crossed at a number of points by boat- bridges. Most of these consist of a roadway on pontoons or native boats {safmehs or danalcs). Usually one or more portions of such a boat-bridge can be swung open to let vessels pass. In a high flood a boat-bridge may have to be temporarily removed. It seems that most of the boat-bridges can take fairly light wheeled transport, but before the war some of them (e. g. that at Museyib) were apparently fit for pack-animals only. There are a number of brick bridges carrying roadways across canals in northern Irak ; and there is an iron bridge across the Kharr canal, 4 miles from Baghdad, on the Baghdad—Nejef road. Eecent railway and road-construction has involved a good deal of bridge-building along the line of the Tigris and elsewhere. The smaller water-cuts are bridged, if at all, by planks of palm- tree wood, which may not be practicable for laden pack-animals. The Euphrates from Pellujeh downwards is bridged at the follow ing points : Fellujeh (boat-bridge). Museyib (boat-bridge). Hindiyeh Barrage at the head of the Hindiyeh branch ; the barrage forms a bridge capable of taking heavy wheeled transport, which cannot use the Museyib boat-bridge. Tawarlj (on the Hindiyeh branch ; boat-bridge). Ktifeh (on the Ktifeh channel of the Hindiyeh branch; boat-bridge). Hilla Eegulator (at the head of the Hilla branch; the regulator affords a bridge capable of taking heavy wheeled transport). Hilla (on the Hilla branch ; boat-bridge). Diwaniyeh (on the Hilla branch ; boat-bridge). Samaweh (boat-bridge). Nasiriyeh (boat-bridge).COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOET 271 Suq esh-Shuyukh (boat-bridge). Kurna (road and railway bridges at the mouth of the Old Channel of the Euphrates). Gurmat All (road and railway bridges (pontoon) at the mouth of the New Channel of the Euphrates). The Tigris from Samarra downwards is bridged at the following points: Samarra (boat-bridge). Baghdad (boat-bridge). Qarareh (boat-bridge). Kut el-Amara (boat-bridge). Amara (new pile bridge with steel floating section to allow passage of river-traffic; total length 750 ft., floating section 270 ft.; width 20 ft.). Latlateh (boat-bridge). The Diyaleh is crossed by boat-bridges at Baqubeh and at its mouth. There are many ferries on the Euphrates and Tigris, on which shdkhturs and qiiffehs ply. Boad Communications Arabistan The plains of Arabistan, where not covered with permanent marsh or (as in the Fellahlyeh district) intersected by frequent canals, generally afford in dry weather a surface which is passable for light wheeled transport; but rain may make them quite impracticable for wheels and difficult if not impassable for pack-animals. Even in dry weather heavy transport is liable to stick in patches of sand. In the foothills of the Persian highlands there are some tracks passable for carts, but among the higher ranges there are only tracks for pack-animals except where the Baghdad—Kirmanshah route ascends to the Persian plateau by Qasr-i-Shlrln and Ser-i-Pul. The high passes are liable to be blocked by snow in winter. (a)In Arabistan light wheeled transport can pass in dry weather with little difficulty over the following routes: Marid—Shushtar via Ahwaz and the Band-i-Qlr bridge (light motor-lorries). Shushtar—Dizful ? Manduwan (near Mohammareh)—Amlnlyeh (opposite Ahwaz). Amlnlyeh—Shush (light motor-lorries). Ahwaz—Maidan-i-Naftun via Band-i-Qlr bridge and Dar-i-Khazineh (where the Ab-i-Gargar would need bridging). Ahwaz—Behbehan via Eamuz. Ahwaz—Bandar Dilam via Deh Mulla or Hindlyan (the Hindlyan would need bridging).272 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT Ramuz—Bandar Ma'shur. Janjireh—Bandar Dilam via Bandar Ma'shur and Hindlyan (the Hindlyan would need bridging). (6) The following tracks are passable for pack-animals : Amlnlyeh (Ahwaz)—Amara. Dizful—Amara via Shush (from Shush onwards practicable for wheels in the dry season). Ahwaz—Maidan-i-Naftun via Abgungi. Shushtar—Maidan-i-Naftun. Shushtar—Ramuz. Behbehan—Hindlyan. Behbehan—Bandar Dilam. For the routes crossing the mountains from Arabistan or Irak to Isfahan, Khurramabad, and Kirmanshah see pp. 258-9, 257. Of the cross-routes in the highlands may be mentioned the mule-tracks from Khurramabad to Deh Bala, from Deh Luran to Deh Bala, and from Deh Bala to Qasr-i-Shlrln and Ser-i-Pul. There is a way reported to be passable for all arms along the lower valleys of the Pusht-i-Kuh from Dizful to Deh Luran and Zorbatiyeh on the Kut el-Amara— Kirmanshah route. (c) Bridges, Ferries, and Fords. The Karun is bridged at the following points: Band-i-Qlr (boat-bridge over the Ab-i-Gargar branch of the river, passable by field-artillery). Shushtar (Pul-i-Lashkar, stone bridge, on south side of town to Miyanab Island ; Pul-i-Bulaiti, a dam across the Ab-i-Gargar east of the town ; the Pul-i-Dizful, north of Shushtar over the Ab-i-Shatait, is broken down). Pul-i-Shalu or Gudar-i-Bulatak on Lynch Road (iron suspension bridge, 20 miles from Malamir and 130 miles from Ahwaz). Du Pulan (brick bridge on Lynch Road, 183 miles from Ahwaz). Above Du Pulan the upper Karun is bridged 3 miles above Duvizdeh Imam (stone and mortar), at Kaj (stone and mortar), at Rustami (wooden; ruins of stone bridge), and at Pul-i-'Ali Kuh (6 miles above Rustami; wooden). The Diz is bridged at Dizful by a stone and brick structure. The Bazuft is bridged at Pul-i-Amarati on the Ahwaz—Dizful road at about 166 miles from Ahwaz (steel wire suspension). The Karun is unfordable in Arabistan, and also apparently in the Bakhtiyari mountains up to its junction with the Ab-i-Behistabad.(m) COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 273 Where it is not bridged crossings have to be made by ferry [keleks at Shushtar and in the hills). The Karkeh and Diz are fordable in places except in the flood season, when they can be crossed only by Iceleh. The Shur becomes unfordable after rain. On the Jerrahi there are many fords in summer, and near Khal- fabad and Cham es-Sabi it can be crossed throughout the year except after recent rain. The Hindlyan is fordable in places to within 9 miles above Hindlyan town. Boad Communications in In the plains of upper Mesopotamia, which lie above the high flood-level of the rivers, road communication is naturally far easier than in Irak. For the most part the surface of these upland plains is easily traversable by pack-animals, and either is practicable for wheeled transport, or can be made so without difficulty. The going may be heavy after rain; bridges on the larger rivers are rare; wadis are frequent in some parts, especially under the hills, and there are patches of marsh-land where drainage from the hills collects. But lack of water and supplies in the steppes and the insecurity of the country have been the chief obstacles to communication. In the lower hill-country there are a good many fair pack-roads between the principal centres and a few routes passable for wheels. In the high ranges there are more or less difficult mule-tracks ; north of the Baghdad—Kirmanshah route, roads for wheeled trans port crossing the mountain-barrier which bounds our area occur only between the Euphrates and Lake Van. The plains enclosed in the highlands are often marshy and are liable to become very muddy in wet weather. The hill-country is inadequately supplied with bridges (see below, p. 275), and the larger streams are generally unfordable after rain in the winter and during the spring floods caused by rain and melted snow. In the winter roads are often blocked by snow for days or weeks. Before the war there were a few stretches of metalled road in upper Mesopotamia, but these were usually allowed to fall into disrepair, so that caravan traffic sometimes preferred the easier beaten track. Apart from these chaussees or fragments of chaussees the roads were unmade except here and there in the highlands where some cutting had been done. Since 1914 a good deal of work seems to have been done by the Turks towards making routes on their principal lines of com munication fit for mechanical and other wheeled transport. mes. i o274 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT (a) Main routes believed to be passable for wheeled traffic : Baghdad—Aleppo via Fell uj eh, Hit, Anah, Deir ez-Zor, and Meskeneh. Baghdad—Mosul via Samarra and the right bank of the Tigris. Baghdad—Mosul via Kufri, Kirkuk, Altun Kopril, and Erbil. Kirkuk—Suleimanlyeh (reported to have been recently made fit for wheels). Mosul—Nisibin via Demir Kapu Khan. Nisibin—Diarbekr via Mardln. Diarbekr—Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani Zokh (for Bitlis ; see below under pack-route Jezlret-ibn-'Omar—Bitlis). Diarbekr—Kharput via Arghana Pass. Birijik—Diarbekr via Hovek and Severek. Birijik—Diarbekr via Urfeh and Severek. J erablus —U rfeh. Urfeh—Harran (and on to Ras el-'Ain?). Ras el-'Ain—Nisibin, Ras el-'Ain—Mardln. Deir ez-Zor—Mosul via Tel es-Sawwar and Tel A'far. Across the desert or open steppe of the upper Mesopotamian plains it is generally possible to find lines which need little or no improve ment for wheeled transport, at any rate in dry weather. Thus motors can traverse the arid desert between Anah and Baghdad or between Hit or Ramadiyeh and Tekrit or Samarra. It is probable that in the neighbourhood of the Khabur and the Belikh there could be found easy lines for wheeled transport connecting the Baghdad Railway in the neighbourhood of Harran or Ras el-'Ain with the Euphrates valley. In many instances wheeled traffic can pass most easily by making detours from the regular routes, and this is often done by native drivers. (5) Main routes practicable wholly or in part for pack-animals only : Kufri—Suleimaniyeh. Suleimaniyeh—Halebjeh (for Kirmanshah or Senna). Suleimaniyeh—Penjevin (for Senna). Suleimaniyeh—Baneh. Suleimaniyeh—Raniyeh. [Suleimaniyeh—Kirkuk ? See under Routes for Wheeled Traffic' above.] Altun Koprti—Raniyeh via Koi Sanjak (does not need much improvement for wheels). Raniyeh—Ser Desht. »COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPORT 275 Eaniyeh Lahjan plain via Wazneh Pass (for Ushnu and Ui'mia). Eaniyeh—Eowanduz. Eaniyeh Lrbil via Koi Sanjak (does not need much improvement for wheels). Erbil Eowanduz (there may possibly be a recently made cart-road between these places). Mosul—Eowanduz via the Great Zab ferry at Girdamamik and Baba Chichek (passable for carts to Baba Chichek). Eowanduz—Ushnu via Kelishin Pass. Mosul—Van via Amadiyeh, Julamerk, and Bash Qal'ab. Mosul—Jezlret-ibn-'Omar via Simel and Zakho (passable for wheels to the Jebel Abyadh). Mosul Jezlret-ibn- Omar via Simel and Feishkhabur (passable for wheels to Simel). Jezlret-ibn-Omar—Bitlis via Sairt and Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani (may have been improved since 1914, but before the war the stretch along the Bitlis valley from Ziyaret Waiz el-Qur'ani (where the Diarbekr—Bitlis road joins) was a very difficult mule-track). J eziret-ibn-'Omar—Diarbekr via Midiat. Jezlret-ibn- Omar—Nisibin (needs improving for carts near Jezlret- ibn-'Omar). Mardln—Urfeh via Veiran Shehr. Diarbekr—Mush via Hazro, Pasur, and the Kulp valley (ap parently passable for wheels to Pasur and may have been recently improved beyond that place). Diarbekr Chabakchur plain cltt Lijjeh (for Erzerum j apparently passable for wheels to Lijjeh). Diarbekr—Palu via Haini or Piran. Diarbekr Chunkush via Chermuk (passable for wheels to Chermuk). (c) Bridges, Ferries, and Fords. Bridges on the larger rivers are rare. They occur at the following places: On the Tigris above Samarra: At Diarbekr (stone). At Jezlret-ibn-'Omar (boat-bridge). At Mosul (boat-bridge). On the Euphrates: At Deir ez-Zor (stone ]unfinished in 1917, completed only from r. bank to island ; thence to 1. bank ' floating' (boat ?) bridge). At Jerablus (railway). s 2276 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT On the Great Zab : At Eski Kelek on the Erbil—Mosul road (trestle-bridge capable of taking field-artillery, recently built). On the Lesser Zab : At Altun Kopru (a narrow bridge steeply arched, not passable for wheels). On the Batman Su : Batman Kopru, west of Farqin on the Diarbekr—Bitlis road (stone). Stone or brick bridges are occasionally found on the smaller streams in and near the hills ; many of these are in a more or less ruinous condition. In the mountains plank bridges for foot- passengers or pack-animals occur ; these are liable to be swept away in flood-time. There are ferries (large pontoons, quffehs, or Icelelcs) at some ot the principal river-crossings. The larger rivers are fordable in places during the low-water season (late summer and early autumn). The smaller stream-beds contain little if any water in the summer and autumn, but after rain or the melting of snow in the hills may become impassable for some time. Road Tra (a) Mechanical transport: Before the war motor-cars had occasionally traversed some of the main routes in the plains of upper Mesopotamia and northern Irak. During the present war motor-lorries have been employed on the lines of communication of the British and Turkish forces. The following notes on the use of mechanical transport in Irak are taken from Field Notes on Mesopotamia, February 1917: The most important types of vehicles in use are the Peerless, Fiat, and Napier motor-lorries. Climatic conditions are not favourable to mechanical transport, (i) The enormous variations in the temperature, and therefore in the density of the air, make the adjustment of the carburettor with the fixed mixture preparation almost impossible, (ii) The cooling effect of the radiator is materially reduced owing to the great heat pre vailing in Irak during the summer months. The engine has there fore to work at an unusually high temperature, and this unfortunate circumstance is aggravated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable heavy oil. . Difficulties are also caused by the alluvial soil of the plains and the lack of made roads. Anything heavier than a 30-cwt. lorry willCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 277 probably break through the desert crust and get bogged in the mud beneath. Where the ground is soft solid tyres will cut from the outset, so that pneumatic tyres are almost essential. The consump tion of petrol is extraordinarily high (3-4 miles per gallon for Peer less lorries) owing to the impossibility of using the higher gears even in dry weather. In wet weather it has been found that mechanical transport is quite unable to move anywhere. The general conclusions with regard to motor transport in Irak have been summed up as follows : (1) Weight on road. —Should be as small as possible. (2) Bearing surface of wheels. —Should be relatively as large as possible compared with power and weight of car. (3) Tyres. —Should be pneumatic without exception. (4) Springs. — Strong springs absolutely essential, with an extra leaf in addition to the maker's usual specification. This applies both to back and front springs. (5) ShocJc-ahsorbers. —Should be fitted to rear springs. (6) Buffers. —Buffers such as ' Nevajahs' should be fitted to all springs in addition to the shock-absorbers specified above. (7) Badiators. —Big radiators are absolutely necessarv, preferably honeycomb. (8) Adjustable extra air-inlets. —Are necessary. (9) Wheels. —Should be of metal, not wood. (10) Bodies. —Should be light. (11) Spare parts. —These should be in a proportion of at least 15 per cent. This is one of the most important points of all. (b) Wheeled vehicles drawn by animals : The common name for all animal-drawn wheeled vehicles used in the country or towns is araba. The following types may be distinguished : (i) The araba or yaila. A light four-wheeled carriage on springs, drawn by 2 or 3 horses or mules. The whole body is covered by a rounded hood for protection against sun or bad weather. The vehicle is entered from the side. It can hold 2 passengers comfort ably, and will take up to 4; 2 persons can be stretched inside the wagon. The front part forms the seat for the driver, and a fair amount of baggage can be carried behind. The hood-construction acts as a good protection if the carriage overturns, as sometimes happens in the hills. An inferior make of this type is used for the transport of baggage or goods, taking perhaps up to 15 cwt. The width of the araba's wheel-track is about 4 ft., the width of the body about 6 ft.278 COMMUNICATIONS AND TKANSPORT The hire of these carriages before the war cost £T10-15 for the Baghdad—Aleppo and Aleppo—Mosul journeys and £T5-10 for the journey from Baghdad to Mosul. (') Omnibus. A four-wheeled covered coach, without springs, made of wood. It is drawn by 3 or 4 mules. It is square-shaped, and has the appearance of a primitive hotel omnibus. The entrance is at the back, and the seats, which run along the sides, can take ten or twelve persons. This vehicle is suitable only for passenger traffic and for routes on the flat. These omnibuses ply on the roads from Baghdad to Kerbela, Nejef, Hilla, Samarra, and Baqubeh. (iii) Gharry (generally so called at Basra) or or aba (generally so called at Baghdad). A four-wheeled carriage on springs, drawn by 1 or 2 horses ; it will take 2 passengers comfortably, can hold 4. It is principally used in the larger towns, and is suitable for short journeys only. (iv) Carts of various types (two-wheeled or four-wheeled) are met with in northern Mesopotamia, but infrequently. They are used for heavy draught work and are drawn by bullocks or mules. (c) Transport animals : Almost all land transport in Mesopotamia was still carried on by pack-animals before the war. Camels are used for pack-transport in the drier parts of the plains, especially in desert and open steppe, and also in the lower hill- country. They are useless on marshy, muddy, or slippery soil. The usual pace of a camel-caravan is 2-2f miles an hour, and its daily march would be generally 10-15 miles. The carrying capacity of the camel varies very considerably with different circumstances—the length of the journey, the character of the surface, the water and grazing obtainable and the bulk of the load. Under favourable conditions a fairly strong camel may be expected to carry 460-500 lb. (in two packages), and exceptional animals will take up to 600 lb. On the other hand 330 lb. is said to be the average for desert routes. See further on the camel pp. 182-4. Horses and ponies are used for draught or pack work on the well- watered routes in the plains and on the less difficult roads in the hills. Baggage-ponies will generally carry a load of about 300 lb. in two packages, and under favourable conditions will move at about 3^-4 miles an hour. The usual day's march for these animals is about 20-25 miles. See further pp. 184-5.COMMUNICATIONS AND TKANSPOKT 279 Mules are used as pack-animals in the hills, and are employed especially in the more mountainous country, where the roads are too difficult for horses. In the plains they are used mainly in drawing carriages and for military purposes. The pack-mule will usually carry a load of about 300 lb., and mule-caravans can move at about 3^-4 miles an hour under favour able circumstances, 20-25 miles being a fair day's march. See further pp. 185-6. (The circumstances mentioned above as affecting the carrying capacity of the camel also make a considerable difference to ponies and mules.) Donkeys are used as transport-animals everywhere, and especially for local, short-distance traffic. They will carry loads of 120-150 lb., and can generally do about 3 miles an hour. See further p. 186. Bullocks are employed in some districts of upper Mesopotamia on specially heavy draught work, and for carting agricultural produce, &amp;c. Khans Khans (caravanserais) are found in towns, in some of the larger villages, and at halting-places on some of the main routes. They are quadrangular enclosures containing a courtyard in which beasts are tethered. Bound this courtyard, in the inside of the outer wall, are alcoves .which are used as rooms and sometimes as stables. In the larger Jchans there is an upper story with rooms for travellers. There is usually a well either in or close to the Beasts are watered either from this, or, where possible, from a neighbouring stream or canal. Fodder can generally be obtained at a being purchased either from the Tchanji or from sellers who bring it to the hostel. In the same way fuel is often brought to the for sale, and occasionally vegetables, &amp;c. But supplies usually, and some times fuel and fodder, have to be purchased in the bazaar. Khans are generally dirty and insanitary. Charges are trifling. There is a fixed charge for beasts, but for their personal accommodation travellers pay as they choose. Some Khans in Mesopotamia are endowed by pious founders and provide Moslem pilgrims with free accommodation, but most are privately owned or leased by the Government.280 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT W aterways and R iver T ransport Principal Waterway {a) The Shatt el-Arab and Tigris up to Baghdad. (i) Persian Gulf— Basra. The Shatt el-Arab can be ascended as far as Basra by ocean-going vessels, but its navigation is impeded by a large bar at its mouth. It has been reported, however, that this bar can probably be dredged so as to allow the passage of vessels of 25-26 ft. draught. So long as it remains undredged vessels of more than 11 ft. draught have to wait for the flood, vessels of about 20 ft. draught can cross at high-water springs, and vessels of about 17 ft. at neaps. Vessels drawing more than 20 ft. are lightened outside the bar, or complete their loading there, according as they are inward or outward bound. There is anchorage in 34-48 ft. of water in Basra reach. Since 1916 a number of wharves which can accommodate ocean-going steamers have been built at Magil 5 miles upstream of the Ashar Creek. Railway tracks are here run alongside the discharging berths, which are so arranged that four or five steamers can unload at the same time, and warehouses have been built immediately opposite. Travelling cranes have also been provided. Since 1916 one ocean-wharf has been built at Basra, besides various departmental wharves; under a revised system of port organization ocean-going vessels are to be dealt with at Magil (11 berths) and Nahr Umar (2 berths). A large repair workshop for river-steamers was erected on the river front in 1916. The construction of a dry dock for river- steamers was taken in hand. This was afterwards stopped, and work was begun on two slipways, the larger of which would be suitable for the biggest boats plying on the Tigris. Before the war there was a small dock, with workshops, in Magil Creek. Only small repairs on river-steamers could be done here. (ii) Basra—Baghdad (500 miles). Practicable throughout the year for suitable steamers (i. e. with independent engines, good ground gear, and steam capstans fore and aft) drawing 4 ft., but at the worst places all steamers stick frequently in low water and have to be hauled through shallows. In high water depths of 20 ft. and more can be found except on Kurna bar and in the worst stretches between Ezra's Tomb and Qal'at Salih, where about 13 ft. of water is to be expected. Width of river 200-500 yds., except in the narrows between, • ® COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 281 Ezra's Tomb and Qal'at Salih, where in places it is only 66-75 yds. Current about m.p.h. in low water; in flood-times it may be 6 m.p.h. or more, and averages about 4 m.p.h. The greatest difficulties are to be found : (1) in the reaches above mentioned from Ezra's Tomb up to Qalat Salih, where, owing to the great volume of water spilt from the river-bed down large canals above Qal'at Salih, the channel narrows and shallows; moreover the bends here are very frequent and sharp; (2) at places between Kut el-Amara and Baghdad, where there are banks of silt which give much trouble in low water. Besides the seasonal variations in the state of the river, changes are constantly taking place which more or less alter the details of navigation from year to year. When the river is falling in the summer the channels take some time to form and are often very erratic. The improvement of the waterway of the Tigris has been under consideration, and certain measures have already been taken: (i) Kurna—Amara. Some work has already been done to improve conditions in the narrows between Ezra's Tomb and Qalat Salih. The measures that have been recommended include the following : (1) Restriction of the amount of water taken off by the larger canals, so far as may be consistent with the needs of agriculture; closure of unimportant and useless channels. In 1916 a weir was built at the head of the Michriyeh canal, where the loss of water from the main channel was then most serious. Later it was found that there was serious danger from the increasing spill of water down the Jehaleh (Chahala) canal at Amara. A bar which had previously acted as a weir at the head of this canal had disappeared, and more and more water was here escaping from the river-bed. In the spring of 1917 measures to check this process were under consideration. (2) Dredging of narrowest parts of the navigation channel. (3) Conservancy regulations, to prevent the Arabs of the neigh bourhood from cutting canals at the river-bends, and from reclaiming land on the river-bank by means of brushwood groynes. (4) Construction of retired bunds or levees in order to provide for the ultimate flow of the bulk of the river's flood-waters down the regenerated channel. The digging of new cuts across the bends would not be safe unless a careful survey had made it possible to foretell what would be the effect on the river downstream.282 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOKT (ii) Amara—Kut el-Amara. Measures recommended are: (1) Maintenance and improvement of existing bunds, and con struction of new bunds. (2) Restriction of the amount of water taken off by irrigation- channels so far as may be consistent with the needs of agriculture; closure of unimportant and useless channels. (iii) Kut el-Amara—Baghdad. The frequency of banks of silt in this part of the river is due largely to the untrained condition of the river-bed and the very winding course which it follows. ' Bandallingor the construction of groynes of bamboos and reed-matting at the upper ends of sand-banks so as to increase the size of the banks, proved successful in the summer of 1917. The digging of new cuts across the bends (as the Turks cut the bend below Ctesiphon, 1915) might, unless based on a most care ful examination of local conditions, have undesirable consequences. (6) The Euphrates up to Fellujeh. The lower Euphrates is navigable for laden native boats of the larger or smaller types according to the season and the conditions on the different stretches or channels of the river. In the years before the war small steamers had occasionally made the journey from Kurna to the Hindiyeh Barrage ; but in low water steamers and fully laden native boats of the larger kinds could not pass the shallows in the lakes, or the mud bars which occurred here and there, and especially near the entrances and exits of the lakes. Conditions have now been somewhat improved by dredging between Kurna and Nasiriyeh, but the shallows of the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh are apparently still impassable in low water for anything but the smallest, or quite lightly laden, native craft. The navigable arms of the river are in parts narrow and tortuous. The details of navigation are liable to change from year to year. (i) Kurna— Nasinyeh. In high water steamers drawing 5 ft. can pass from Kurna to Nasiriyeh. Upto 1916 steamers and large native boats fully laden could not reach Suq esh-Shuyukh in low water owing to shallows on the Chubeish bar, the Hammar Lake, and the Haqiqeh bar. Dredging operations were undertaken in the autumn of 1916 in order to open a channel for the low-water season. In 1915 and 1916 the main navi gation channel between the Hammar Lake and Suq esh-Shuyukh had followed the Haqiqeh arm, the Haqiqeh dam having been destroyed by the British in 1915; but as rice-cultivation in the neighbourhood was dependent on this dam it was reconstructed, and the MezlaqCOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 283 channel was improved for navigation, the bar obstructing its eastern end being apparently dredged. From Suq esh-Shuyukh to Nasirlyeh there are ample depths at all seasons. Between Kurna and the Hammar Lake the width of the channel is 180-160 yds.; the Mezlaq channel was reported in 1915 to be only 25 yds. wide for the first 2 miles above its mouth; from Suq esh- Shuyukh to Nasirlyeh the average width is 150-200 yds. The current is slight to Suq esh-Shuyukh, thence to Nasirlyeh it is reported to be 2^-3 knots. Large native boats navigate from Gurmat Ali to the Mezlaq channel across the Euphrates TMr in high water. (ii) Nasiriyeh— Samaiveh. Navigation on this stretch appears to be easy. A steamer drawing 3 ft. 2 in. made good running here in February. The width of the river is said to be about 300 yds. to Duraji, and from there to Samaweh about 50-120 yds. (hi) Samaiveh— Hindiyeh Barrage (Hindiyeh branch). The navigation channel in 1913 followed the Shatt Khansar be tween Samaweh and Shinafiyeh, crossed the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh, and thence proceeded up the Shamiyeh channel to Kifl. A steamer drawing 3 ft. 2 in. made this voyage in February 1912 and at the beginning of July 1913, but in the months when the river is lowest only small bellams, or large laden to not more than one-third of their capacity, can cross the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh. There is a bar at the southern entrance to the Shinafiyeh Lake, where in February 1912 there was less than 2-| ft, of water. Navigation on the lake is difficult and variable. The Shamiyeh channel had 4-7 ft. of water in July 1913. Its width was generally 50-150 yds., but navigation was somewhat hampered by irrigation-dams which left only a narrow fairway with a strong current. The Kufeh channel from the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh to Kill is prac ticable only for small native boats. Depths on the Hindiyeh branch have been reduced by the Hindiyeh Barrage, and in 1917 they were further decreased owing to the cutting by the Turks of the Saqlawiyeh dam (near Ramadiyeh), which has now been repaired. (iv) Samaweh—Hilla Regulator (Hilla branch). This arm is probably navigable for large native craft and small steamers in high water, the Hilla Eegulator being open. Exact information is not available. (v) Hindiyeh Barrages and Hilla The Old Hindiyeh Barrage, near the head of the Hindiyeh branch and about 6 miles below Museyib, practically blocks navigation.284 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT though empty native craft can be hauled or shot over it in high The New Barrage (about ^ mile above the Old) and the Hilla Regulator (about i mile above the New Barrage) are not passable for large river-steamers, as their navigation locks are only 2 64 ft. wide, (vi) Hindiyeh Barrage—Fellujeh. Depths on this stretch are reported to be 3|-6| ft. in low water and average 18 ft. in flood. The width of the river is generally 150-300 yds. Current in January about 2 m.p.h, (c) Shatt el-Hai (Shatt el-Grharaf). The Shatt el-Hai affords a waterway only in the high-water season ; in low water it is practically dry. It is reported that river-steamers drawing 4-jr ft. can navigate from Kut el-Amara to Abu Mahau from February to June, and native craft drawing up to 21; ft. can generally use this part of the channel in July and December. # From Abu Mahau to Decha Suweij (20-25 miles from Nasirlyeh) the channel is about 12 ft. broad and 2ift. deep in high water. There is in normal years no water communication between Decha Suweij and Nasirlyeh, though in exceptionally high water, in 1915, the Turks sent convoys of small to the Euphrates about 5 miles below Nasirlyeh by the Umm Jemal canal. In high watei large hellams can generally pass from the Euphrates to the Khor Huseiniyeh and reach the north-eastern limit of that lake, about 6 miles from Decha Suweij. The only reliable waterway between the Shatt el-Hai and the Euphrates is the Nahr Beidha or Beda'ah, which takes off from the Shatt el-Hai about 2 miles above Shatrat el-Muntefiq and runs to the Hammar Lake. This is practicable for large from December to July. The Nahr Hamzeh or Shatt el-Ibrahim branches from the Shatt el-Hai about 20 miles below Shatrat el-Muntefiq and discharges into the Hammar Lake. This is passable for small Itcllauis from Decembei to July. (d) The Diyaleh. . . The Diyaleh is navigable by saftn in high water to within a tew miles of the Hamrln hills. In March 1917 H.M.S. ascended the river to Baqubeh. In the low-water season there is no waterway on the Diyaleh, its supply being diverted near the Hamrm hills into the Khalis and other canals. The river follows a tortuous course, and is 50-150 yds. broad.COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPOET 285 The passing of upward and downward-bound vessels might cause difficulty owing to the sharp bends and the high banks which restrict the range of vision. Current 3 m.p.h. in the lower reaches, gradually increasing to 4 m.p.h. Principal Waterways Arabistan (a) The Karun. (i) From Mohammareh to Nazin. The Karun up to the Ahwaz-Naziri rapids is generally navigable for vessels of 5-6 ft. draught, but in low water vessels drawing only 3-| ft. may have difficulty at places within 20 miles of Nazirl. Width about 300 yds. Current 5-7 m.p.h. in a high river, and about 2-2| m.p.h. in low water. The Nazirl rapids are passable by towing, but even native boats find great difficulty here in a low or very high river. The rapids have twice been ascended by craft under steam. Usually cargoes are landed below the rapids at Nazirl and transported to Ahwaz at their upper end. (ii) FromAlavds to Shaleili. From Ahwaz shallow-draught steamers can navigate the Karun to Shaleili on the Ab-i-Gargar branch of the river, about 70 miles above Ahwaz and 7-| miles below Shushtar. Dar-i-Khazineh, where are the A.P.O. Co.'s sheds, and from which a cart-road leads to Maidan- i-Naftun, is 4-5 miles below Shaleili. It is reported that a little blasting would open up the channel at Shushtar. (h)The Bahman Shir. The Bahman Shir mouth of the Karun is navigable for about 30 miles from the Persian Gulf by vessels drawing 7 ft., but in the uppermost 14-15 miles it is very shallow, the channel being ob structed by mud-flats. Native sea-going boats cannot pass the shoals of the upper Bahman Shir without waiting for the tide, which here makes a difference of about 9 ft. (c) The Ab-i-Diz. The Ab-i-Diz was ascended in August 1892 by a stern-wheeler drawing 2| ft. as far as Umm el-Wawlyeh 20 miles from Dizful. But a recent report states that, while the Diz is navigable by country boats 'for some little distance' above its junction with the Karun, even in the flood season of 1916 boats failed to get within 25 miles of Shush (i. e. perhaps about 40 miles of Dizful).286 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOET (d) Marid Canal. n ^ There is hellam traffic between Mohammareh and Fellahlyeh by the Marid—Fellahlyeh canal. Principal Waterways in (a) The Euphrates from Birijik to Fellujeh. The middle Euphrates has up till now been used mainly for downstream traffic by shaMturs (see p. 292) from Birijik, or, since 1914, from Jerablus or Meskeneh. Steamers have occasionally navigated the river, and an experiment was made in 1911 with two large and powerful motor-boats ; but of these latter one was wrecked and the other was subsequently transferred to the Tigris. (i) Downstream navigation. (1) take from about 14 to about 45 days from Jerablus or Birijik to Fellujeh, according to the state of the river, the wind, &amp;c. (2) Steamers drawing 3-4 ft.^ and motor-launches have done the journey from Meskeneh to Fellujeh, but only in a full river would the journey be fairly safe. (ii) Upstream navigation. (1) Native craft do not navigate upstream of Hit owing to the swiftness of the current, especially at the rapids. ShaJcMurs are towed back empty. (2) Light-draught steamers can ascend to Meskeneh in high water, but progress would be slow, and it has been reported that a speed of 12 knots would be needed to make head against the current between Hit and Anab. In low water the upstream journey would be dangerous, perhaps impractic able, for steamers. From a report of 1903 it would appear that navigation (especially in the months of mean water) could be improved by considerable engineering works at the rapids below Hadiseh between Hit and Anah, at those off Anah town, and at those of Abu Quba'i and El- Hammam above Kaqqah. The dams of the water-wheels which occur on some stretches of the river help to impede navigation. The Germans are said to have improved the waterway since 1914, but details are lacking. It seems that they have placed life-saving apparatus at dangerous places, and have destroyed a number ol naurs. (b)The Tigris from Diarbekr to Baghdad. The upper and middle Tigris is an important waterway for down stream traffic, the craft iri use being rafts on inflated skins {kelehs see p. 291). (i) Diarhehr — Mosul (? about 335 miles). The times taken by helclis on this stretch of the river are reported to vary from about 4 to about 20 days, according to the state of the river, the wind, &amp;c.COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 2$7 Rocks and whirlpools make navigation difficult and somewhat dangerous in the gorges between the mouth of the Batman Su and Hasan Kaif, and again between the Bohtan and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. Rapids also occur in the stretch between Jezlret-ibn-'Omar and Mosul. (ii) Mosul— Baghdad (? about 300 miles). Times taken by vary from about 3 to about 15 days (or 2-10 days to Samarra), according to the state of the river, the wind, &amp;c. Safmehs can ascend from Baghdad to Samarra (106 miles by river) in high water. It appears that in low water they would have to be unloaded and portaged over shallow places. With regard to steamer navigation satisfactory information is not available. It seems that in a high river (April-June) steamers drawing 4^ ft. can ascend to Tekrit (140 miles above Baghdad), while steamers of 8^—4 ft. draught can reach Qal'ah Sherghat (about 220 miles above Baghdad). In low water (September-November) steamers drawing 3-| ft. or more cannot navigate above Baghdad; but the shallow-draught steamer Ju is said to have been able to reach Samarra at that season. Before 1917 there had been hardly any navigation of the river above Samarra by steamers. In 1839 the (3 ft. draught) reached Sultan Abdallah 40-45 miles below Mosul. In the spring of 1917 a number of Turkish steamers, drawing 3^-4f ft., passed upstream of Baghdad, and one, the drawing about 3-| ft., reached Haji Ali a few miles below Kaiyara and about 20-25 miles above Qal'ah Sherghat; she there went aground. The current is strong. Rocks which endanger navigation occur above Samarra, and rapids are formed by rocks or ledges of shingle. It is believed that, if the rocks forming the principal obstacles to navigation were removed by blasting, shallow-draught steamers of considerable power could ascend to Mosul. (c) The Lesser Zab. This river is navigable by ltdeTts from Taktak (about 45 miles above Altun Koprll) to its junction with the Tigris. There is a good deal of JceleJc traffic from Altun Koprii and Baghdad, but in low water JceleJcs of the larger kind, carrying goods, do not usually travel on the Lesser Zab. Usual times for Jceleks from Altun Koprtl to the Tigris are : in high water, 12-24 hrs. ; in low water, about 3 days. It is possible that small steamers of considerable power could ga navigate the Lesser Zab in high water as far as Altun Kopru. There (0I jji are rocks and rapids in the channel, and in low water depths in jJi places are only 1-2 ft.288 COMMUNICATIONS AND TEANSPOKT Paver Transport {a) Steamers and Motor-vessels._ Typical classes of steam river-craft now in use are: (i) Improved Medjedieh class: 225 ft. long, 52 ft. beam, 4i ft. draught, independent paddles, (ii) Stern-wheelers: 150 ft. long, 35 ft. beam, 4^ ft. draught, (iii) Tugs: (1) independent paddles: 115 ft. long, 39ift. beam, 4|ft. draught; (2) tunnel-screws: 81ij ft. long, 17 ft. beam, 3§ ft. draught. All these classes use oil-fuel. Motor-craft are of many types, but for general purposes a 40-ft. launch of 30 h.p. is used. (h) Native Graft. (i) The safineh or maheileh is a type of native sailing-vessel used on the rivers of Irak. It is common on the Shatt el- Arab and Tigris from Basra up to Samarra, and s of the smaller kinds are found on the Euphrates. Safmehs are built mainly at Basra. It appears that, while safineh is the general name for craft of this type, the word maheileh is used for large The sdf inch may be from 30 to 80 ft. long, with a beam about one-third of its length. Its carrying capacity may be 10-75 tons, according to size, and a large safineh may hold up to 60 passengers. Draught, when fully loaded, 3-4 ft. Crew, 3-15 men ; the captain of the safineh is called the nolcada._ The safmeh is built with considerable sheer, giving the midship portion a freeboard of about a foot only when the vessel is fully loaded, while the gunwale at bow and stern is several feet above water. The safmeh is an open boat, but the larger sizes have a poop, and all have a steering platform aft as well as a small forecastle deck for working ground tackle and for poling. The bow is pointed (the stern also to a lesser degree), and the lines of the vessel are fine. There is one mast, carrying a lateen sail, and the vessel is steered with an ordinary tiller and a broad rudder. Against the wind, or against the current when there is no following wind, the safmeh is towed or poled along the shallow water close to the river-bank. Towing is done by means of a long rope attached to the top of the mast. Usual speeds are : Baghdad—Basra : high water, 4-7 days; low water, 2-3 weeks. Basra—Baghdad: high water, 2-3 weeks ; low water, 5-7 weeks. A great deal of time is lost on the upstream journeys owing to the frequent necessity of towing. Cost of construction, «£100-&lt;£250.

A large haghalah may take 100 men or 20 horses. (ii) The danalc is a sailing-vessel found principally on the Euphrates, though large dandks are to be met with on the Tigris. The danah is 80-40 ft. long, and is generally of from 9 to 11 tons burden. It is an open boat, pointed at bow and stern, with a plat form at each end. The stem and stern-post rise above the gunwale, but the danalc is not built so low amidships as the The hull is coated with bitumen. The vessel may be either sailed or poled ; there is one mast with a lateen sail. The (la)iul: is a much clumsier-looking craft than the satinclt. and is lighter and less strong in its construction. It is used mainly for light bulky cargoes such as date-stalks. (iii) The hellam is used on the Shatt el-'Arab and the canals taking off from that river. Large cargo hellmns are also found on the lower Euphrates. The small hellam as seen at Basra {hellam is long and narrow, somewhat resembling the Venetian gondola. It is about 20 ft. in length, and 3 ft. in its greatest beam. The is flat- bottomed, and draws very little water. It is generally poled, but can also be rowed, paddled, or sailed. There is a platform at either end. The hellam is usually poled by two men (one on the fore plat form and one on the aft, or both forward), and steered by a third with a paddle. These boats are used for passengers and small goods traffic. The large bellams [aragiyeh) are used as lighters or cargo-boats. They may be as much as 60 ft. in length, and carry 9-60 tons, according to size. (iv) The mashhuf is a canoe used in southern Irak on the marshes of the lower Tigris and Euphrates. It is the chief means of loco motion possessed by the Ma'adan, or ' marsh Arabsof this region. The ordinary masJiMif is 15-20 ft. in length, and can hold up to 1 or 5 persons. It is constructed of light planks or reeds, and is covered with bitumen. It can be rapidly propelled by a man with a paddle who sits aft. A larger type of mashhuf, called has a mast and sail. It is built of thin planking and is covered with bitumen. (v) The quffeh, a kind of coracle, is found principally on the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, but is also met with elsewhere on the Tigris and on the Euphrates.

Before the war there was no regular service of steamers on the middle Tigris and Euphrates, though experiments had been made.COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT 291 In 1836 Chesney descended the Euphrates from Birijik with two steamers, lost one of them at El-Qaim, and with the other (which drew 3 ft.) reached Basra. In 1870 Midhat Pasha, then vali of Baghdad, started a service of two small steamers between Fellujeh and Meskeneh. But this was soon discontinued ; it appears that one of the vessels was wrecked on the rocks just below Ardeshir near Anah. In 1911 two large and powerful motor-boats (length, 65 ft. ; draught, 2^ft.) were placed on the river. One of these was soon afterwards wrecked, and the other was withdrawn. Since 1914 the Turks have apparently used motor-boats, and possibly small stern wheelers, on parts of the middle Euphrates. (See further p. 286.) The Tigris was ascended in 1839 by the ss. (3 ft. draught) as far as Sultan 'Abdullah, about 40 miles by river below Mosul. Between 1839 and 1917 light-draught steamers had very rarely gone above Samarra, and none had passed above the Hamrin hills. A small steam-launch plied fairly regularly between Samarra and Baghdad. The German archaeological expedition at Qalah Sherghat used a motor-boat on that part of the river. It is reported that in the flood-season of 1917 the drawing 32- ft. or 4 ft. according to load, reached Haji 'Ali, a few miles downstream of Kaiyara, and about 55 miles by river from Mosul. Other Turkish steamers then reached various points between Tekrit and Haji Ali. It is reported that motor-boats are being constructed in Germany for use on the Tigris. {b) Native Graft. (i) The Mel:, a raft supported on inflated skins, is used for down stream navigation, principally on the Tigris from Diarbekr to Baghdad and on the Lesser Zab from Altun Koprti, and occasionally on the lower courses of the chief tributaries of the Tigris other than the Lesser Zab. (Outside our area there is Mek navigation on the Frat Su and Muiad Su in Armenia.] There are also ferries on the upper Tigris and on the Tigris tributaries, as well as on the upper Karun. The Melt consists of a square platform of timber built up with layers of poles to a thickness of l|-2 ft., and then covered with rough planks. On the under side and round the edges of this plat form are attached inflated skins, the number of which varies from 50 to 800, according to the size of the raft. A small hut or tent can be erected on the raft to serve as a cabin. The carrying capacity of a Iceleli may be from 5 to 35 tons. A raft of 200 skins is said to be about 20 ft. by 30 ft. The MeTc can move downstream only, and is steered by means of t 2292 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPOKT two roughly fashioned oars. In hot weather the exposed parts of the inflated skins have to be constantly splashed with water to prevent them from bursting. In the intense summei heats the larger leleks carrying merchandise rarely navigate, but the smaller types used for passenger traffic travel on the Tigris and Lesser Zab throughout the year. Adverse winds greatly delay progress, and mav make it impossible for days. ,, , , On arrival at their destination, the rafts are dismantled, the wood sold, and the skins retanned and conveyed by pack-transport to e P Eafts from Diarbekr usually stop at Mosul. Rafts from Mosul go down to Baghdad, but raftmen {Mehjis) are changed at Teknt. ihe crew of the raft usually numbers 2 or 4 men. Normal times for Melt journeys are : Mosul-Baghdad, 2-4 days in high water ; 8-15 days m low water. Altun Koprli—Confluence of Lesser Zab and Tigris, 10 hours in high water ; 2-3 days in low water. „ , . The hire of a Melt is reckoned according to the number of skins.

Before the war they were built only at Birijik ; since 1914 they have been constructed at other places on the Euphrates for use on the Turkish lines of communication {s has been reported as occurring at Jerablus, Deir ez-Zor, Anah, and Hit). They are oblong in shape, 18 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, with a depth from gunwale to flooring of about 2-| ft. When fully loaded they draw 14 ft. The bottom consists of tree-trunks sawn halt, beneath which flat boards are nailed ; and a flooring of flat boards is tastened 1 ft. above the bottom. The sides and ends of the boats consist ot flat boards roughly nailed together, the interstices being stuffed witn rags daubed with bitumen. One boat carries about 5 tons._ bhamurs almost always travel in pairs, fastened together side by side, iney are steered by clumsy sweeps, pulled in the bow, and are so un manageable that they can travel only in a flat calm. They are ha e to be stopped by the slightest wind. The times taken by on their journeys vary enormously according to the state o river and the wind.
