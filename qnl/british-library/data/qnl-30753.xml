Fuad telegraphed on December 21st that he would have to stay at Riyadh until the end of Ramadan but hoped to see me immediately after ensuing festival which should end about January 9th. I have had no further direct news of proposed invitation to me to visit Riyadh. Philby is confident that the King intends to issue it. It is possible that Fuad may deliver it on arrival though rumours are current here of grave dissension over internal .affairs in royal circles at Riyadh. I have now received Mr. Rendel’s letter of December 6th. I appreciate difficulty of forming final instructions but trust I may receive early in January sufficient indication of your views not only about eastern frontier but on other main subjects discussed with Fuad in September to enable me to embark on useful further conversations with him in any case and with the King if I go to Riyadh.here when the King oomes in iareh for the pilgrimage. In any case I must have something definite to tell Fuad when he returns (? grp. omtd.) visit in the near future. It would help me greatly to know whether His majesty's Government are disposed to embark on comprehensive negotiations as recommended by me at any rate to start with, or would prefer to deal with the various (? questions) separately from the outset. I should simultaneously like to have some indication of their latest views on the principal questions in anticipation of detailed instructions and to know generally how far I can go with Fuad when we meet.

While I recognise the practical difficulty of obtaining cash payments from Ibn Saud, if seems important to keep the debt question alive, since, if Ibn Baud is made to understand that K. .0. attach importance to it, it may be that, even if early recovery of the debt proves to be impracticable, some concrete concession could, be secured in return for a iurfher postponement; whereas if the question is dropped he mill think it is of no importance and it will lose any value even as a negotiating counter.

The Foreign Office have now sent us draft Instructions to the Minister at Jedda. The only points arising out of these instructions in which we are directly concerned are: (1) Whether the Minister should aim at a general comprehensive settlement; (2) The Blue Line; (3) Koweit Blockade; (4) Bahrein Transit Dues. 3. On the first of these points - whether a general comprehensive settlement is preferable to dealing in isolation with the various points which have been raised,-reference is invited to the submission on P.Z.7135/34. It is suggested that the recommendation of the Middle Last Committee that a general comprehensive settlement should be aimed it, but that Sir A. ftyan should be given discretion to recommend a reversion to disposal of the items in dispute in isolation if in his view the local situation or the course of discussions renders that preferable, may be accepted. 4. Blue Line. The India Office representative in the discussion in the Middle Last Committee made it clear that the Secretary of State lor India was not prepared to commit himself as regards the Blue nine until he had received/further information which the political Resident in the Persian Gulf has been directed to obtahi as regards the present position m the/ 2621 6000 3/34s - 2 - i the hinterland at the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat. The service Departments have, in the past, ecLU&lt;J.l&gt; teen anxious, before any final oecision is reacned as to tne line to he adopted on this subject, to consider their strategic desiderata. Finally, and pemaps in some ways most important of all, Ion Saud has not yet committed himself as to the precise extent of his claim in the interior of Arabia. In these circumstances it seems impossible to give the Minister any instructions at the present point, other than that he should, if it is impossible to avoid discussion of the Blue Line, endeavour to ascertain what Ton Saud's aesiderata are. I do not think: that we could possibly go so far as the Foreign Office draft instructions now suggest, viz. that while they cannot make up their minds finally until the supplementary information awaited is forthcoming, at this stage accept the conclusions of the Middle hast Committee. On this point it seems | , better to suggest a redraft, and I have warned the Foreign Office that, unless the Secretary of state is prepared to concur in their draft Instructions, we should have no option but to do so. 5. Koweit Blockade . Certain minor alterations of wording alone are required in the Foreign Office draft on this subject. 6. Bahrein Transit Dues . The instructions are suitable. The discussions on this subject to which reference is made in the draft despatch to Jedda have already been submitted and no exception has been taken to the provisional conclusions reached in them. 7* We are not directly concerned with the question of the Saudi-Transjordan Frontier; and the questions 1 emergency landing grounds on the Hasa Coast and of ff the debts of Ion Saud to H.M.G. and the Government ■ &amp; . of o %3 Minute Paper.

A copy of the Minutes has been sent to the Government of India. 2. The most important single subject uiscussea mts the attitude to be aaoptea on the question of the Blue Line. A separate submission will be made upon this once we receive the information about trloal allegiances etc. in the ninterlanu which we still await from the Gulf. Meanwhile, with a view to expea iting a decision once that information is available, ana to putting the Go ve rnrnent/Government of Inula in closer t ° teen passing iiere, the a.o. letter{oi vviiicn a^copy is attached has teen sent them. 3 . Of the other matters discussed in the Middle hast Committee, we are not actively concerned, witn tne Question of the Saudi- Trans Jordan frontier, nothing of ‘ — ■ • 1 importance took place about the Koweit Blockade; ana the Question of the debts of tne Saudi Government to H.luG. (India is interested in respect of £10,000, being the balance outstanding of tne amount due to her for certain arms supplied to Ibn Saud in 1929) is of minor importance. But tne discussion (on pages 17-21 of the record) on the question whether H.L.G, should be recommended to continue to aim at a general comprehensive settlement of all utstanding questions, or to aim instead at dealing with the various questions in isolation, is of some importance. It will be seen that the Sub-Committee decided to recommend that H.L.G. should adhere for tne present to the idea of securing a general settlement, i.e. simultaneous settlement, oy comprehensive agreement, of major outstanding questions; cut that Sir A. Ryan should be given full discretion to revert to the idea of separate settlement of the various questions at issue should he see fit. 4 * As sir Andrew Ryan returned to Jedda on the 23rd, dnia will ieach theie early in December, the Foreign Office, not unnaturally, are very anxious to give him categorical instructions as early as possible on the various points covered by tne negotiations, and we cannot be sure tnat he will not lino, it necessary to start his conversations with the Sauuis very shortly alter his return.

If it had been possible for him, pending a decision on the.Blue Line, to start discussions in regard to the less important points on the agenda, such a s the Koweit Blockade ana the Bahrein Transit Dues, there would have been much advantage in this. But we cannot start to discuss the question of the Koweit Blockade until the Sheikh of Koweit has formally agreed to the .abandonment of his claims against Ibn Saua, ana the latest inform ation from the Gulf is to the effect that pending the disposal of the Koweit oil negotiations it is 'undesirable to approach the Sheikh on this suojeco. 7/e are not without hope that the oil negotiations may reach an early conclusion (there are various outstanding questions wnich we hesitate to oroach with the sheikh for fear of indisposing him pending tneir conclusion) in the near future.

It seems clear that we cannot leach any satisfactory decision as to toe instructions to be given to fyan on this subject until the further information which we are awaiting from the Persian Gulf •iias reached us. it may, however, be necessary to take a decision, once that infonartion has been received, at vory snort notice. (^s.n reaches Jeaaa about the miuale oi December, and conversations may open very soon after he arrives). You may therefore like to cohsiuer in a bie Mr. h.a.F. Metcalfe, CaX» f UXE* f MVD preliitilnar^/preliminary way, la aov* nee of receipt of the information from toe Gulf, toe various alternative propositions which were examined in toe course of the discussion in the meeting* r.rlma facie, there is a great deal to be said for toe desert area solution. But toe problem of potential concessions is a real one, and if oyan is right in thinking that I bn Gaud will be reluctant to agree to a settlement which sterilizes toe desert area, it may increase the difficulty of a settlement, we have ourselves no title in respect of the country to toe east of the Blue Line and on lae Information at present available to us it is extremely doubtful if &gt;ur various Gulf proteges either have (or could be induced to put forward) a claim which caula be substantiated as against Ibn Gaud to a far-reaching influence in the assert hinterland. Ana there are objections of ^ome substance, which were brought out in the discussion in the middle Last Committee, and which are also smphasisea in the notes of conversations with Thomas of which you have had copies, to a formal recognition on p: per of Gaudl sovereignty over an extensive and ili-aeiinea area in which/5 wiaieh the degree (ana peminence) of Ibn aqua's innuence is very questionabie. a* vii the face of it, therefore, there might be sometning to be said for authorising .,-yaxi to start his negotiations on the basis of a desert area of the type suggested in paragraphs 3 - 9 of Randal's letter of 7th November, No* E 6769/279/91, of which copies were sent you under L&amp;ithwaits*s Air ivail letter p. ,.6893/34 of 8th November, within which both His Majesty's Government (on behalf of their proteges) and Ibn 3aud would, at tiny rate for a specified period, agree to renounce any interest in the grant of concessions* If, as Ryan seems bo fear might be the case, it proves impracticable to make any real advance with Ibn gaud on this basis, he Blight then possibly agree either to a joint regime (whatever the legal justification for ft might be) or to the attribution to Ibn Gaud of a certain area in the uesert, well away from the coast, in full sovereignty, subject to the 'servitude* ‘that no concessions within that area should be granted, save in eon &amp;Bht&amp;tion *ibh ana with the prior approval of His majesty's Government* V- 4 . 4 * As regards tine question of tactics in the uaxi^ stages of negotiations at Jeada, this is of course primarily one for the Foreign Office ana t,iu ..inister, put we cannot help feeling uert departiuentally (thou^a i jua not sure that the Foreign Office woula agree) that tiie right line for ryan to take would be that on matters such as tiie mo wait Blockade, etc., we were prepared to start discussions at once, but that on trie question of the Blue Line we hau so far been quite unable to ascertain what precisely Ibn Baud had claimed; that we viere very ready 'to consider, as part of a satisfactory general settlement, any reasonable modification of the Blue Line, which was, in our view, internationally ana legally oincline upon him, but that it was impossible to consider the detail of any such modification merely on the basis of his very generally stated claim to the desert as opposed to the coastal area, h. I may perhaps acid that very confidential information has come to us wnich rather suggests that Ibn Baud is not particularly anxious to reach a decision on the question of the Blue Line on the basis of a specific/- 5 specific ael’inition of Uie area of his influence and vtinX from his point of view there may be a O ooa aeal to r,e sB»id xor leaving matters as they stallu f he on his side exercising a v ^ua ana unaefined imluence over Central Arabia, wuile ids majesty # s Goveim^nt re&amp;i&amp;in unaoimittea as regards toe n in ter land borders of their •Arab proteges. It may he that our discussions will end in a decision to mark time and 1 m not sure that from our point of view there would not he a good deal of advantage in tills. But to ere is much to he said for any settlement which will fomilly limit Ion Baud’s influence to an area which can be indicated on a map, end wiiich will not conflict with the claims of any of our Arab proteges; ana it would be worth a good aeal to secure this. It therefore seems desirable, whatever the prospects of a successful outcome to our negotiations, closely to explore the various possibilities of an agreed and detailed settlement, we shall therefore value when the time comes, i.e. as soon as the information which we await from Fowle reaches them, a telegraphic expression of the Government of india # s views on this, ana on the alternative solutions of the Blue Line pro ol eiii wnich were/- 6 - wert aiscussed In tne meeting ot the Middle OoMaittee. 6.

The main question to decide was whether the proposal for a general settlement of outstanding questions should be pursued or not. MR. RENDER recalled that the suggestion for a new general comprehensive settlement with Ibn Send had originally been put forward mainly as a result or trie difficulties which had developed over the question of the 'Slu Line'. It was clear that we should have to make some concession to Ibn Saud in this area, and if tins concession was not to he represented as a surrender it , .. -i hi n 11 o’Vi t, into some mind of was desirable that it snouid Do oroug.n + vnreover the concession could then general settlement.

The dela^ n.xd Affairs ha.d no t t -c--3- mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining any indication ot Ibn baud’s desiderata regarding the 'Blue Line'. Puad Bey Hamza had been asked to state these desiderata, but had been unable to do so. Eventually the Saudi Minister had, on the instructions of his Government, made a statement regarding Ibn Baud’s claims. Although it had been extremely vague, it showed that Ibn Baud was putting his demands very nigh; and inaeed he appeared to be claiming the greater part of south-eastern Arabia. it was for consideration whether, in view of the extent of these claims, the idea of a general settlement based on a compromise in regard to the 'Blue Line' could be pursued with any real hope of success. The present meeting had been called firstly in order that the Foreign Office representatives might report what had passed^ with particular reference to conclusion (a) of the Sub-C«mmittee f s meeting of 13th September* and secondly owing to the desirability of reaching some conclusion on the general question of principle prior to Sir A* Ryan’s impending departure for Jedda on S3rd November. It was very desirable that Sir A. Ryan should be furnished with some preliminary general instructions * and if the lines of these could be agreed on it would then be possible to submit a concrete proposal for ministerial approval. The sooner this could be done the better. As he had indicated* the question whether negotiations for a general settlement could profitably be proceeded with turned mainly on the question of the n Blue nine • It was therefore necessary in the first inoucuice to ^ each some conclusion as to the policy to follo»/ed cn point. The position now was that His Majesty s ^o^eminent had officially taken their stand on the legal validity ot the 'Blue' and 'Violet' Lines, but had indicated that they would be ready to compromise, as part ot a generalsettlement. Ibn Baud on the other hand had indicated in -4- a general v/ ay that he claimed the whole of the desert area' Tf . Meanwhile 5 informal discussions had taken place with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ? while on leave s and with Mr. Bertram Thomas s the explorer of the Ruba-al-Khali desert; and these discussions s as shown in the papers which had been circulared,, threw a somewhat new light on the problem. In these circumstances the various courses open to His Majesty’s Government might perhaps be summarised as follows:- (l) To take our stand firmly on the ,? Blue ,f and '’Violet' Lines 9 and to refuse to offer any compromise or to recognise Ibn Baud as possessing any rights to the east ana south oi these lines. It was clear that this would only result in a major quarrel with Ibn Baud over a matter where we were* incidentally 5 by no means sure of our grouna. ±n tn^oo circumstances this course could presumably ra-od out once. (2) To try to reach a settlement toy offering a ,, ^ ... a 4 - n f&gt; the '’Blue*' and '’Violet 1 ' territorial compromise to one enso Lines. „ i n-ina 1 ly cont emulated at the uime This was tne course oi j -i rr+t- . put in view of the con-' of the meeting of September 1- &gt; , v-ioh Thomas 5 in particular 9 u-a. siderations to which o tn verv serious objections an r attention 5 it seemed open -pooa-i t) 1 . e in prac uico. now seemed unlimely to prove . e»si territorial claims* (51 to admit Ton Sana s xuxx ^ . , to many oo.jeerions.

It was in fact most important that something should be done without delay to fix a limit for Ibn Baud’s sphere of expansion to the east and south and particularly towards the sea. Moreover to leave matters as they were might lead to serious difficulties over the grant of concessions, etc. , and probably over the precise extent of the Standard Oil of California’s existing concession in Hasa. (5) To fix an inland limit (it was later suggested that this might run parallel to the coast 100 miles x rom trie coaot on the north and 200 on the east and south) for the territory to be regarded as falling under the full territorial sovereignty of our Arab proteges, ana oo create -a beut^al belt M on the inland side of it. Much would depend here on the character of the neutral belt, but generally speaking there were serious objections to the creation of any kind of unregulated vacuum., while a neutral zone, as at Koweit, subject to joint, and often conflicting, sovereignty, was open to cvon moi e objections. special 'desert area', subject ( 6 ) The creation of a wi thin a kind of 'ring fence ? to a special desert regime, . x-up t^o-ner which had already as tentatively suggested m been circulated as Fct.(o) 162 .Briefly tij .6 last ... . t&gt;bC “ 3bx ^ i v 'a special f, desert zone ,f should he c^eateri , c,eated ? within vvnich Ibn Baud should he able to maintain his r esent i , . . s: 100 dc Overlordship tlie tribes § hut in resnect r^-F' n-v -i ^ 5 in reepect ol which the various parties cone erne a should, by a kind of mutual self-denying ordinance renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the grant of concessions, the establishment of permanent fortifications, etc. It would be an area rather like a maritime zone, where rights would oe personal and not territorial, and, to continue the analogy, where i the tribes could be regarded, so to speak, as flotillas, flying a particular flag, but free to change their allegiance if they eventually wished to do so, and possessing no territorial ties. Meanwhile, in his conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza, he had taken the line that Ills Majesty’s Government would only be prepared to modify their attitude of rigid adherence to the legal boundaries set up by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions , as part of a general comprehensive settlement, in which they should obtain satisfaction in other directions; and he did not think, therefore, thdu these conversations had necessarily committed His MAjo-^ty s Government to making a concession, or to negotiating general settlement, although it was clear that a concession would have to be made if a major quarrel was to be avoided. MS. LAITEYAITB pointed out that the iurtaer informs, lion which the Political Resident m hie vei.i..n -uli been asked to collect was not yet available. Until it was available and had been considered, -nc. n 4 . ^ Y&gt;/:G&gt;r&gt; }'■ anv deci s i 0 n cxo State for India felt unable to .1 „ p a p.c,-j ino* with the between the various possible methods o. ° u p c-reed, however, that tnei e '’Blue Line' question. iiC/ ''° ^ y a nrovisional character no objection to a discussion - + , ,. !fTP of , the information au in general terms at tins bpresent available While basis, of th ie cr« agreeing as to the objection to a solution on the eation of a Neutral zone* he said that he aid not think that some variant of this solution ought to he completely rulea out of court at the present stage, if there were to he any chance of persuading ihn Saud to agree to a Neutral Zone, say s 50 miles from East to West running from the base of the Qatar peninsula to the 20th parallel of latitude ? it would be well worth our while to face the inconvenience involved on the assumption that Ibn Saud would have no rights to the East of such a zone. Speaking personally, however., he v; by the solution suggested i November which wa was much attracted in Mr. Eended’s letter of 7th as based on previous discussion with the India Office.

He pointed out, however, that in every previous similar case (e.g. Iraq and Transjordan) it had been found necessary to define some geographical limit in desert areas and the results had on the whole not been un satisfactory. Ibn Saud was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of H.M. Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the ’'Blue Line”. He was perturbed at the British attitude, although he was sincere in his conviction that he was not legally bound by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions, and would not accept the contention that the frontiers laid down in them were valid. Sir Andrew Ryan considered that he might with some hope of success suggest to the Saudi Government, on his return to Jedda some settlement on the lines suggested by Mr. Rendel, i.e. a loose system of control by Ibn Saud over the desert area, subject to the qualification, however, that, in his ^Sir A* Ryan’s) opinion Ibn Saud would never entertain the suggestion that no concessions should be given in this area for twenty years. On the other hand, he thought that Ibn Saud might be induced to undertake not to grant a concession, in the inter mediate area between territory under his sole control and the coastal principalities, except to a group approved by both the British and Saudi Governments, a group for in which the participants approved by them should have an equal interest. Sir A. Ryan took the opportunity of observing that he had felt greatly handicapped in his previous discussions withFuad Bey Hamza by his inability to refer to the question of oil? unless Fuad Bey should himself bring this question up? which he had never done. He would like? if only speaking for himself in the first instance? to be able to tell Fuad Bey frankly that the question of oil was influencing every question in east Arabia? and to try to elicit information as to the existing commitments of the Saudi Government? notably as regards the territorial scope? on the eastern side? of the concession they had given to the Standard Oil Company of California. He was convinced that this would be the best means of elucidating the situation and exploring the possibility of some agreed settlement. WING COMMANDEB PIRIE pointed out that if the boundaries proposed by Mr. Rendel in Paper No.M.E*(0) 162 were accepted? the territory of Ibn Saud at the Dohat-es-Salv/a would be brought very close to Qatar and the. task of protection at this important point would be rendered very difficult. It would be an advantage, therefore, if the original 'Blue Line' could be adhered to at this point. MR. RENDEL recognised the drawbacks of any arrangement which would bring Ibn Baud's frontier so close to the base of the Qatar peninsula as the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa. It would of course have been most satisfactory if the propooed special desert area could have been extended in some way up to the Gulf of Bahrein, so as to keep the territory unuer Ibn Sand's full territorial sovereignty further away irorn the called Qatar 'protection line'. Unfortunately, it was at this northern end of the 'Blue Line' that Ibn Saud had the strongest claim to a re-adjustment of the boundaries, since oeveral Akhwan settlements already existed near the head of the Dohat- es-Salwa. Mr. Rendel felt sure therefore that unless we T v,ri q« n d f s full territorial sovereignty as agreed to recognise Ibn oaua s xuij- least up to the head of the Dohat-es- extending in this area a- 1 P Salwa it would wreck any hope of a settlement of the major question regarding the limits of the 'desert area' m t e-10- MR. SEAL thought that the ^vf main justification for the intervention of H.M. Government in the affairs of the desert tribes (as distinct from those inhabiting the coastal area) was the possibility of mineral wealth, and in particular, oil, being found in the desert area. He agreed with Mr, Rendel that it was important to prevent the political influence of Ibn Saud from expanding over the Trucial etc, tribes under our protection; but he pointed out that the desert regime suggested by Mr, Rendel would allow Ibn Baud’s political influence over the tribesto expand unchecked in the hinterland towards the maritime tribes so long as his prestige remained the paramount factor in Arab politics. Mr. Rendel’s scheme would have the additional disadvantage of sterilising mineral development for perhaps a lengthy period. If the territorial sovereignty of this desert area passed to Ibn Saud, a difficult question of protection would arise if oil etc. were ever exploited, in view of the wild character of the desert tribes. He agreed that at the present time H.M. Government had. no rights over the inland areas not claimed by thoir Arab clients, but then neither had Ibn Saud, and the status of this territory was, in fact, that of ’’res mullius . It would, therefore, be open for H.M. Government to acquire the right to have a voice in the disposal of these concessions in agreement with Ihn Saud, who was the only other possible claimant. He, therefore, welcomed the suggestion that had been put forward by Sir Andrew Eyan that oil and other mineral concessions in this area should be a matter for settlement Jointly between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, although he deprecated the suggestion that . ._ r ^ the area should vest in Ibn the ultimate sovereignoV - ^ 4 -v.^ difficulty this would involve Saud, in view of the diftic f over protection.COLOrTEL MAGKESY thought that the two fundamental factors were (a) to exclude Ihn Saud from obtaining a footing on the coast line, and (b) to make sure that any potential mineral or oil wealth should not fall into foreign hands. If such were found it would hardly be possible to prevent exploitation Unless some definite boundary were laid down now we should only be laying up a store of trouble in the future. He suggested that an outer hard and fast boundary line, say, some 1G0 miles from the coast, should be fixed, while an inner boundary, i 0 e*, the strip along the coast, only would be administered. This was similar to the system followed on the North West frontier of India, where the outer, or H Durand n line, was the actual boundary, while the inner, or ''administrativeboundary formed the limit of effective control, MR. LAITHWAITE said that if the proposed 'desert a rea' could be sterilised so far as concessions were concerned, it would greatly ease matters, otherwise a difficult question would arise. It could not be overlooked that His Majesty's Government had no rights of their own in Central Arabia and consequently could have no right to grant any concessions. Any claim to mineral rights in these regions could oe made by them only on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat or the Trucial Sheikhs# But neither the Sultan nor the lrucia.1 Sheikhs had, he thought, any extensive territorial claims in the hinterland. SIR ANDREW RYAN said that his suggestion did not contemplate the creation of any dual right on the part of Ion on.ud ■■ -nd His Majesty's Government to grant concessions, but .ou1..l o J an agreement by Ibn Saud not to grant concessiono e^c^pt parties in which British interests were adequately represented. He recognised that this would involve a special lim.ito.tion of Ibn Baud's sovereign rights in this area, but he Jioug might possibly be secured* -11-^dT He strongly shared that the territories of Muscat were contiguous ^should not extend his a the view that it was necessary to ensure the coastal Sheikhs and the Sultan of along the coast line, i.e. that Ihn Saud uthority to the coast* If this were secured he did not consider, subject to oil considerations, in which he had meant to include economic concessions generally, that an admission of Ihn Saud ’s sovereignty up to the confines of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, would adversely affect the interests of H«M 0 Government e Some use might be made of the fact that Fuad Hamza, in a book published by him in 1932, had given a map showing a dotted line running generally southward for about 150 miles from Dohat-es-Salwa and ending indeterminately in the desert* This might be invoked as an indication of what Ibn Saud considered the limits of his area to be 0 MR. REIIDEL thought that it would be most satisfactory if some arrangement could be reached with Ibn Saud by which he should agree not to give any concessions in the ’’desert area 1 ’ without the consent of His Majesty’s Government* It would not be possible for His Majesty's Government to claim rights in respect of concessions in the desert area as representatives of the Trucial Sheikhs, since the territorial rights of these Sheikhs could not possibly be regarded as extending so far inland; but His Majesty s Government could no doubt take the line with Ibn Sc.ud th...t, J were ultimately responsible for - or at least most intimately concerned with - the coastal area from Bahrein eastwards and southwards to Aden, it was reasonable that they should claim to be consulted over the grant of concessions m thu interior, if concessions were granted to foreigners m thr...t &lt; r- , interests of the coastal belt would certainly be effected, owing to the fact that anyone operating a concession m the desert area could only approach the site of the concession through the coastal helt. On the other hand, the grant of concessions would he definitely an act of territorial sovereignty, • n - nd mlght ° n Ihn Saud to establish m uch m ore permanent and effective rights in the desert area than had been contemplated m the sugg-st.o -12-for the future in the desert area. put forward in M.E* as so (o) lot. The desert area inucciblo aiid so 'barren oh.at it did not seeni a very lively place f oi the developnient or concessions in the near future. But the possibility of its proving a rich area at some more distant date could not be excluded. It was not on ay a question of oil ? but of possible other minerals. There had been suggestions that there might be gold in some part of the area, and some other important natural wealth might be discovered. Again if foreign enterprises were to seek to develop the area, they might well, as in the case of the desert crossed by the new Iraqi pipeline, be able to bore deep wells which would produce enough water to enable irrigation to be carried out, thus changing the whole character of the country. In these circumstances he felt that it was most important that any settlement should be subject to revision in not more bran years time 5 am?, that every effort should be made to prevent the premature crystallisation of territorial righto in h.e area. If, however s Ibn Saud insisted on the r Wht to grant concessions, he agreed that it would be essential that his Majesty's Government should have a say in the matter, He could not for tne he moment recollect why it was that Sir A. Byan .f -- 1 -nru to reter to oil in his had been instructed not to r - conver ’sations with the Saudi Government. He thought that the reason probably was a temporary on^? would be no objection to a r now, if Sin A. Ryan thougl p„ and that there reference to oil being made ht it desirable. But in his important consideration, which the coastal view oil was not the most , rrr i n ered« to keep Ibn Saul away from w as, he c ons i g. e d e a, belt, and to retain a certain ’ ~ amount of freedom of action* ^ He thought it would be 'very desirable 9 hoY 7 ever ? to try to secure ireedom oi passage for aircraft over the desert area - a point which had been alluded to in Mr. Bertram Thomas’ report in M.S.(O) 161. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - That in the light of the discussion and on the information at present available they were impressed by the possibility of a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in Mr. Rende1’s letter to Mr. Laithwaite 9 circulated as Paper No. M.E.(0) 162 5 on the understanding that the special regime would be one of renunciation or limitation and not of administration 5 and subject to a satisfactory disposal of the question of concessions in the desert area. The question was raised whether it would be necessary, in order to improve the hope of Ibn Saud’s acceptance of a settlement on the lines in question, to recognise him as sovereign in the desert zone, though subject to servitudes, but this question was reserved. In these circumstances they recommend that the proposal be more closely examined with a view to a conclusion being reached, once the information awaited by the Policital Resident has been received and has been considered. SJ ORDAl'i RONTIER. THE CHAIRMAN thought that further information was necessary before a decision could be reached. A survey was being conducted in the neighbourhood oi x oint a report might be expected in December. MR. BLAXTHR observed that two new points of importance emerged from the Acting High Commissioner s despatch the 26th October. The first was the proposal that boundary in the north-east should commence ^ intersection of meridian 39° east and parallel and not from the summit of the Jebel Anaisa, and tne second the suggestion that the line BC should be moved .. -rx op.p-ned impossible? . • 1r , Q further eastward.

On the other hand, it must he borne in mind that the Gaud is had recently become much more vigilant on the Transjordan frontier, and that it might not therefore be possible to postpone a consideration of this question much longer. The question of the Transjordan frontier, however, was not likely to prove a decisive factor in reaching a decision whether to aim at a general settlement or not. Important as it was in itself , it was definitely secondary to such questions as that of the 'Blue Line 11 and that of the Koweit blockade, which were the main factors to be considered in discussing the possibility of comprehensive settlement. As regards the possible readjustment of the frontier which had been referred to, he felt that, while it mignt be possible to clear up various difficulties on this frontier by a re-interpretation of the Hadda Agreement, it would be quite out of the question to obtain from Ibn Saud any actual territorial concession, however smaj.1, involving a modification of the Eadda frontier, except possibly in return for some important territorial con cession elsewhere. TH1 CHAIRMAN observed that the Transjordan Government could not well claim that the latitude and longitude should be accepted as defining the frontier in one place, i.e., at the north eastern point, whereas at point S they wished to stake their claim on physical features and not on the latitude and longitude fi*ed for that point. CONCLUSION . THE SUB-COM4ITTEE agreed that the te^’efewlffo^thfpreseSt ^discussed on receipt of further information. t] ¥ I' Is !71 -16- 3®IT [•QCKADE ■&gt; Mk. j^AITiAyA liiii said that the correspondence which had been circulated to the Committee showed the oresent position. Nothing could be done until the Sheikh drooped his claims against Ibn baud. Unfortunately some further delay was likely before we could take this matter up with the Sheikh. The Political Resident had been given a discretion as to the moment at which to approach the Sheikh. MR. REN DEL said that, until the question of a com prehensive settlement had been raised in connection vmth the discussion of the problem of the “Blue Line”, the Foreign Office had always contemplated that the Koweit blockade question should be dealt with as a separate issue, as in the previous somewhat analogous cases of Saudi-Iraqi and Saudi-Transjordan relations. It had been thought that any important concession in regard to the “Blue Line” might have rendered a settlement of the Roweit blockade question a good deal easier, rut ii we were now to make our concession to Ibn Baud over the clue Line subject to a number of unpalatable conditions and provisos, he would probably cease to regard it as a concession, and it would no longer furnish a lever for negotiating a settlement of the Koweit blockade. In that case it would presumably be necessary to revert to «ho iAea of dedli with the Koweit blockade separately. M^HIS sir ANDREW RYAN , in reply to the Chairman, said he did lSSSYT. not consider that the prospect of a general, settlement v.ould be improved by an offer at this at age to diop His 3 Government’s claims, against the baudi Government,V -17- to some £30,000. On the other hand he could not conceive that if a general settlement of other questions were in sight, it should be imperilled by insistence on the payment of these claims as part of it. his view was that the claims should be kept alive for the time being, without necessarily being press ed too insistently unless conditions v/ere more propitious than they had been since the last strenuous effort to effect a settlement of the claims, made by His Majesty’s Charge d ! Affaires towards the end of 1933. A waiver of the claims mi perhaps be contemplated at a later stage, e.g. in the form which Sir A. Ryan had tentatively suggested some little time ago, i.e. by setting the claims off against the rental which Ibn Baud had asked for the grant of facilities for aircraft, including the provision of landing grounds. MR. BRIDGES said that if it should appear that there 7 i/as no prospect of obtaining repayment 01 this debt, it would probably be preferable that it should oe oifset against some concession rather than written oil without ony corresponding gain. Having surveyed the various outstanding issues, tae Sub-Committee reverted to the question whether they should recommend that His Majesty’s Government should continue to aim at a general comprehensive settlem all outstanding questions or aim at taming the vaiious questions in isolation. m. tssm. «»« «“» the 5' t0 *“ f01 “ settlement bed first been -de, 1. — “btempl-.a «b.« His Majesty’s Government would oe m a position , . Th} c-aod on the question of the conspicuous concession to I i-vp less risk of this 'Blue Line', and that tnere wou-nd -concession proving damaging to our prestige, and more- advantage to be gained from it as a lever for obtaining counter concessions from I bn Gaud in return ~ particularly in regard to the Koweit blockade - if it were to be included in a new general comprehensive settlement of all outstanding question s. But the position had now somewhat changed. It seemed clear from the course of the discussion that His Majesty's Government would not now be able to offer I bn Saud any spectacular concession over the question of the 'Blue Line' . On the contrary it was now most doubtiul whether it would be possible to persuade Ibn Gaud to accent any kind of settlement on the terms now contemplated, since, although we should be leaving him a pretty free hand over a very large area to the east and south of the 'Blue 1 - and 'Violet' lines, we should oe maning tnis conce^si subject to conditions and limitations of his authority, which it would be very difficult and perhaps impossible to get him to swallow. ^ould be lucky if we got Ibn Saud to accept anything approximating to our present proposals, almost certainly be impossible and it would consequently dimes -i 0 r -o o re al concession tor to represent those proposals bargaining purposes elsewhere. khis woulu of our main arguments for aiming at a general settlement would be undermined, and it might therefore be that we should do better to take each question m . nb course, general objections, Moreover, there were, of - himself had recently drawn attention to which Sir John Simon himself Mon (The oroposed Anglo-Persian ire.ty,, “ h ' sontr „.„, a i ,»=«»»= to attempting to poo. a &lt; ■'' « t 111 ement - particularly m the Ec-st. into a portmanteau settlement -18-Such a method often ended in enabling our adversaries to Play off one question against another and to obtain promises of concessions from which we could not subsequently recede. Fuad Hamza himself had given us an opportunity of escaping from the proposal for a general settlement by the objections wmch he had raised at the second meeting on September 20th to what he had called 'marchandage'. it must be remembered, however, that it was I bn Baud himself who had first suggested the idea of a comprehensive settlement of outstanding diificultics, and such a settlement would still present great advantages. Apart Irani settling the major issues of the south-eastern frontiers, the Koweit blockade, etc.. , it would clear up the position as regards the Treaty of Jedda, which was unsatisfactory, and would offer an opportunity of securing a settlement of a number of other outstanding points of minor importance. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office felt that matters had now proceeded so far and so much had been done to arouse the Saudi expectations that it could hardly fail to affect our relations sith the Saudis prejudicially if we did not pursue negotiations with them. The India Office were in these circumstances in favour of pursuing discussions at Jedda and the balance of advantage in the light of what had passed in the talks with Fuad seemed to lie with aiming at a general settlement. But they thought in the first place that it would be a mistake to rate the prospect of a satisfactory issue to the negotiations too high or to be disappointed if nothing came of ohem, secondly, trn.t we should not rate the value 01 such a settlement uo Ibn Not only was he apparently very anxious 8aud too low.to secure our general support consequent on his apprehensions (for which there seemed to be no foundation) of a TurcO' Persian combination against him - a fact which, incidentally, might make him more reasonable in discussion - but, apart from that, he seemed to appreciate a great deal better than the Persians that our goodwill was a substantial asset to him. Mr. Laithwaite did not agree that the concession con templated in regard to the 'Blue Line' would be regarded by Ibn Saud as of little value. While it might not be as extensive as he would like, lie would at any rate get a .way from the Lines of the 1913—14 Conventions and he vvould secure the formal recognition on our part of his position in a considerable area to the hast of the 'Blue Line . SIR Ah DREW RYAN said that on the whole he would prefer to adhere for the present to the plan of attempting a general settlement with the Saudi Government, or rather as he would prefer to put it, the simultaneous settlement of ail major questions. There were several such questions, in which one Party or the other desired satisfaction, or which they both had an interest in disposing of. The most important of those which His Majesty* s Government wished to see settled was that „ n .. o c -„ * pvan did not think that of the Koweit blockade, ano. oil ■ i.-&gt; tn obtain a settlement of this important tney would be aole to obtain matter unless they could offer Ion oaud bo,m. Kind cession in some other direction. He also felt that ohe attempt to secure a comprehensive settlement would be. consonant with the general line taken m the recent dis n. rvm-or'pcipntat ives during the tafat cussions with the baudi w ^ ^ ^ however non-committal these discuosi two or three montns, ^ 10v '° had been. -20-As regard s the value as a lever of any possible concession to Ton Baud over the question of the south-eastern frontiers, he felt that the question would turn very largely on what was done in regard to sovereignty, if His Majesty’s Government v;ere prepared to recognise Ibn Baud’s sovereignty over the whole ? oi' the greater part? of the v/ide area which he claimed, to the east and south of the “Blue” and ’’Violet” lines, even though maKing their acceptance of his claims conditional on his acceptance of certain ’’servitudes” - e.g. that he should not grant concessions without the consent of His Majesty’s Government - he thought that the recognition would have such value in the eyes of Ibn Baud as to confirm the chances of obtaining: a satisfactory settlement of other questions. Ibn Baud had to consider Arab opinion, which would be greatly impressed if he could represent himself as having resisted alien pretensions in Arabia. He could represent his acceptance of ’’servitudes” as necessary, provided his sovereignty were admitted. If it were not admitted, the value of the ’’Blue Line” question as a lever would be greatly diminished. Sir A. Ryan added that Ibn Baud might be expected to boggle more over the admission of flying rights in the area than over a bargain regarding economic concessions. While thus advocating adherence for the present to the idea of a general settlement, Sir A. Ryan thought that it uld be easy at a later stage, if it should seem more ; sirable, to switch over to the idea of the separate 't-tiement of the various issues, since Fuad Bey Hamza nimself d given us the opportunity of doing this b,&gt; his re-marks garding the objections to any kind of Ich Mr. Rends 1 had just referred. Should Fuad revert to is suggestion it would be possible for Sir Andrew ig/sn to press readiness to deal with the various Questions parately, but to propose that in that case tn~ question .e Koweit blockade should be taken first.CONCLUSION. On the question whether or not His Majesty's Govern ment should aim at a general settlement* i.e. ? the simultaneous settlement Ly comprehensive agree ment of major outstanding questions* the Sub committee recommend that His Majesty's -Government should adhere for the present to the idea of securing; such a settlement* but that Sir Andrew Ryan should be given full discretion to revert to the idea of separate settlement of the various questions at issue should he see fit.

My dear Gilhert, With reference to your letter P.2. 6810/34 of the 5th Novemher, enclosing a note of Bertram Thomas's views on the south-eastern Arabian frontiers question, and to our various recent conversations on the subject, I write, as arranged, to put on r ecord the very tentative suggestion which I mentioned to you for a possible solution of this problem on new lines in the light of the further information now available. 2. The most important new feature in the situation seems to me to be the point which Thomas brought out in his talk with us on the 31st October about the extremely shifting and temporary character of tribal allegiances in this area, and the probable impermanence of any overlordship which may at any one moment be exeic_s over the desert tribes by whoever happens at the time to be the most powerful of the neighbouring „rabian If Thomas is right in stressing this point to he does, it is perhaps more important than me thought that we should avoid tying’ our handS W ^ premature recognition of Saudi territorial sovereignty over a wide area over which it may no longer extend inn - 2 - practice when Ihn Saud dies and his personal prestige begins to be forgotten. Indeed it seems possible, from some of Thomas's remarks recorded in the note enclosed in your letter, that Saudi influence over some of the northern tribes in the desert area may v/ane even before Ibn Saud's death, if Ion Jiluwi, whose personal prestige has apparently done so much to bring these tribes within Ibn Saud's sphere, were to disappear. 5. The main object of my tentative suggestion would he to try to meet this difficulty hy the creation of a special 'desert zone', within which it would still he possible for Ihn Saud to maintain his present loose overlordship over the tribes, but in respect of which the various parties concerned should, hy a kind of mutual self-denying ordinance, renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions, the establishment of permanent fortifications etc. It would not he a 'neutral' zone with so-called 'equal rights', nor a mere 'no man's land' where there would he no rights at all, hut an area - rather like a maritime zone - where rights would he personal and not territorial. It would have to he subject to a special desert regime, which could I think he so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights which he does at present effectively exercise over the nomadic tribes - e.g. the right to levy a certain amount of zikat (either as tribute or as insurance) in the loose and rather undefined way which Thomas has described to us. etc. the same time it would preclude Ibn Saud - or for that mat ourselves acting for any of our proteges - from giving an y oil or other concession implying territorial sovereignty, or from establishing permanent territorial claims to the area in questiono25 -4- 6. The rough framework of the kind of agreement T have in mind would be somewhat on the following lines:- Jhe Contracting Parties ? with a view to resolving certain difficulties which have arisen in connexion with territorial boundaries in south-eastern Arabia,'' would agree as follows: A special 'desert area', subject to a special desert regime, shall be created, the boundaries of which shall be as follows (ihese lines are merely tentative suggestions to serve as a basis for discussion). On the west, a line starting from the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa and running due south to parallel 19, and thence in a west-south-westerly direction to the Eastern boundary of Nejran. Cn the east a line running from the same point on the Dohat-es-Salwa in a south-easterly direction to the western corner of the Sabkhat-al-Amra salt lake (just west of the Khor-el-Odeid), as shown on such-and-such a map. Thence due south to the well of Baniyan (the well itself could be on one side of the line or on the other, according to what seemed most suitable), as shown on such-and-such a map, where it appears on the intersection of Meridan 51 and Parallel 23 (as shown on that map)® Thence in an east-south - easterly direction to the true intersection of Meridan 55 and Parallel 22, Thence due south to the true intersection of Meridan 55 and Parallel 20. Thence in a west-south-westerly direction following the edge of the limit of the; sand dunes of the Ruba-el-Kali desert (which is well marked), as shown on such-and-such a map, to a point so many mil'-o duo north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramaut. Thence in a north-westerly direction (see below) until it rejoins the westerly limit described above®5- % 8* rDn Saua would th en undertake (in whatever form such an undertaking could he made most palatable to him) to P ut forward no claims of any description whatever to the areas to the east and south of the line described in paragraph 7 above from the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa to sucn-and-such a point (e.g. where it crosses the so-called violet line) and His Majesty's Government for their part, and on behalf of their proteges, would undertake to put forward no claims to the area to the west of the line described in paragraph 6 above. Special provision might have to be made for the sector of the line between Nejran and the so-called violet line, where it may march with the Yemen. 9* Within the ,f desert area 1 ' none of the parties to the convention would possess any exclusive territ o rial rights, and in particular they would undertake to refrain from granting any concessions and from establishing any permanent fortifications. They would also undertake not to raise objections to the passage over this area of each other's aircraft. But a system of loose overlordship might perhaps be described which would recognize Ibn Gaud's present de facto rights. The Contracting Parties would further agree that the special regime set up for the 'desert area' should in the first instance last for a period of, say, twenty years only, and that at the expiration of that period it would be subject to reconsideration at the instance of any of the Parties concerned. 10* This is an extremely rough and tentative outline the sort of thing I have in mind, and I recognise that the fuller information which we are awaiting from tne Gulf ma Y ^materially alter the position. Moreover I have not'TIT S7 Yf : yet had time to consult Andrew Ryan about it, and he may see serious objections to it which have not yet occurred ■ to me. In any case there are obvious difficulties even as regards tne mere definition of the boundaries let alone the definition of the regime itself, Id* dt is also for consideration whether v/e should not try to in^luoe a much larger area to the west of the blue and purple lines within the 'desert area'. This would, I think, be in accordance with the actual facts of the situation, and would make a tidier job of the whole thing from the purely geographical point of view. It seldom pays to disregard geographical factors. At the same time Ibn Saud will presumably object to giving away his full territorial sovereignty over anything to the west of the blue and violet lines, p al&gt; dicularly as it appears from Philby T s map that he does in fact exercise a fairly definite territorial sovereignty as far to the south east as the parallelogram bounded on the north and south by parallels 22 and 19 respectively, and on the east and west by meridans 50 and 52, These, however,- are points of detail which can be considered if and when we find that the general principle of a special desert area subject to the kind of regime which I have indicated, is worth pur suing. 12. My chief fear is that Ibn Saud is likely to make great difficulties over abandoning his claims to territorial rights over any area even to the east of tne blue ana violet lines. But it is just possible that, if it were only by some arrangement of this kind that he couia secure our acceptance of his claim to personal overlordship o/er all-the tribes of the desert area, he might be persuaded to agree. 13. i am sending a copy of this letter to Hina.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Hamza Bey, arrived in Rome on 9th September and on the following day visited the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution accompanied by the Italian Minister at Jedaah. Later he was the guest at luncheon in the Scacchi Club of Signor Suvich, with whom he subsequently had an official conversation. 2. On 11th September, His Excellency was received by Signor Mussolini, with whom, according to the official communique , he had a “cordial conversation on problems “interesting the friendly relations between the two countries”; p * and later on the same day the talks were resumed with Signor Suvich. Other points in his programme included a visit to the “Istituto per l’0riente“ and to an open-air opera. After a reception at the Institute, Fuad Hamza Bey left Rome on the evening of 12th September. An interview with him subsequently appeared in the “Giornale d’ltalia”, out apart from rather fulsome praise of Fascist Italy and the Duce, and the reiterated intention to preserve good relations with this country, it did not contain any statement worthy of special mention.

THE ahove-mentioned aehgates have, under instiactions, from their respective Governments, discussed ceitain que.o' 1 ''’ regarding British ana Italian interests in southern Arabia ana Red cea. The delegates, acting under their instructions that tne respective policies of tne two Governments in southern Arabia5/ 2 and idle Red Sea should he pursued in a spirit of friendly co-operation and developed on parallel though independent lines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on the following points;- 1. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between the various Arab chiefs. 2. That such influence as the two Governments may be in a position to exercise respectively with Ibn 3aud, the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of Asir, should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict in order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs. 3 That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, the two Governments should not intervene in any conflict which, despite the efforts of the two Governments towards pacification, may break out between those chiefs. 4. That the guiding principle in Britisn policy in the bed 3ea is the security of imperial communications witn India and the nast. For this purpose His Britannic majesty's Government regard it as a vital imperial interest that no European power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Fed Sea, ana more particularly on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, end that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands shall fall into the hands of an unfriendly A-raD ruler. That, on the other hand, it is the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coaso of the boa Sea, that no European power should establish itself on the Araoian shore of the Fed sea, or on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into trie hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler.5. That triers should de economic and commercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and suojects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion. 6. That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purpose of securing the sanitary service of the pilgrimage to Mecca, hut that for administrative reasons His Britannic majesty’s Government do not consider it possible at present to agree to the Italian request for the participation of an Italian doctor in the quarantine service. But since the Italian Government maintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty’s Government are disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originating in Italian colonies or possessions Increases to such an extent as better to justify the presence of an Italian doctor. 7. That it is in the common Interest of the two Governments to use their respective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as far as may be possible the mutual interests of Italy and Great Britain, and that, therefore, it is desirable that the two Governments should maintain close touch with each other in all questions affecting the Red Gea and southern mrabia, in order to avoid misunderstandings between them or misapprehensions on the part of the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies which the two Governments intend to follow in the above-mentioned aieas.

It will be remembered that in the summer of this year overtures suggesting that Ibn Sana was anxious to estaolish closer relations with H.K.G. ana that he woula welcome general aiscussions were maae to Sir Anarew Ay an by puad Hamza at Jedda. Suoseyueiitly the Minister was Invited to pay a farewell visit to Ibn Sana at Tail. Alter consultation with this Office, which urged the desirability of avoiuing any appearance of colaness towaras aavances on Ibn Saua's part with a view to establishing an entente_coraicjhg, oiv Anarew Ayan was authorised (Foreign Office telegram of 10th July, on p.Z. 4630/34 flaggeu) to adopt a friendly attitude in his discussions and to intimate that H.M.G. would welcome a strengthening/2. strengthening of the ties of friendship between the two Governments and would be prepared to enter into general conversations on outstanding questions with this in view. He was however also to make it clear that we on our side attached importance to a satisfactory solution of the question of the Blue Line and such outstanding questions as the Koweit blockade. 2. The record of the' conversations with the King is contained in Sir Andrew Hyan's memorandum on P.z.5549/34 below. As a result of those conversations, in the course of which Ton Saud sounded the Minister as to the possibility of coming to an arrangement with Iraq unaer the auspices of H.M.G., and set out his views on the questions of the Blue Line, the Koweit blockade and Bahrein Transit Dues, the King indicated nis uesire that advantage should be taken of a private visit which Fuad Hamza was making to London for further conversations with the Foreign Office with a view to subsequent negotiations of a more formal character at Jedaa on sir Andrew Hya^s return in December. Fuad Hamza reached London in September, arid thereafter seven meetings in all took place at the Foreign Office. Two of these were concerned with the question of oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone, regarding which a separate submission is being made. The matters discussed in the remaining meetings, the record of which is attached (P.z. 6180/34) ma^ be divided as follows:- (a) Ibn Saud's general political position. (b) The Blue Line aispute.

He is apprehensive (though apparently without reason) of a Turko-Persian combination directed against Iraq and against the Arab world generally, and would like to fortify himself by a closer entente with Iraq« if possible under the auspices of H.M.G. such an arrangement, especially if H.M.G. could be induced to ' guarantee it, would leave him secure on the north, while he would hope no doubt, now that the death of Peisul has removed his only effective competitor in Arabia, to exercise a greater influence in Iraq and in Arabian policy generally during the early stages of the new reign.. As regards the Sheikhdoms of the, gulf , he is anxious to shake himself still fleer of the restrictions imposed on his freedom of action oy the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedua, by which he undertook to maintain peaceful aod friendly relations witii Bahrein and Koweit aid with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman coast, who are in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The otscure reference which Fuad himself made to this point in the discussions (and in the earlier conversations at jedda recorded on P.Z. 4f&lt;&gt;6/34 flagged) were supplemented hy a conversation between Fuad and Colonel Dickson to London to September. Fuad's 4 ~-i ^v-v YaiQio'h +.n cjl ]2’£C6 St thatItn Saud, regarding himself as the leader of Arabia, was disposed to resent our special relations with the coastal Sheikhdoms and to aim at establishing '|Mt|&gt;fif could not he persuaded to allow the Sheikhdoms to fall under Saudi control,\t any rate that any relations between a foreign power and the Sheikhs should be in the natureof a regime d*exception and, particularly by land, as limited as possible. 5 . As regards the wider international field, Fuad Hamza broached the question of a possible Saudi application to enter the League. The uncertainty oft boundaries of Saudi Arabia and the existence of slavery are obstacles to the attainment of this object. The slavery difficulty, especially if the King found it possible to make some concession which at any rate would look well on paper, might not be inaiperable; while if an arrangement could be reached with H.M.G. regarding the Blue and Violet Lines and the Transjordan Frontier, the question of boundaries would no longer form an obstacle. And entry to the League would further greatly strengthen the King*s international position, even if internally the obligations which it involved might, if carried out, prove more of a burden than an advantage politically. 6* On all these points the Foreign Office adopted a generally sympathetic attitude, but they made it clear to Fuaa that H.M.G. would not be prepared to add to their own obligations; that any understanding with Iraq must be consistent with the existing obligations oi the parties and notably with those of Iraq under her Treaty of Allience witn us and as a Member of the League of Nations,; and that in the case of the Gulf sheikhdoms H.M.G. would be unable to acquiesce in any development of relations with Ihn saud the effect of which woula he to make5. 2621 6000 3 34 Minute Paper. Department. n tfiie 3heikhdoms into something ILke the satellites of a larger Arabian power. ^» ii is of interest that in the course of the discussions Fuad referred to the recent reiteration of the Persian claims to Bahrein ana remarked that, speaking as an Arab, he would like to see Bahrein develop into an independent Arab unit. In the meantime he certainly did not wish to see Persia establish a claim as against 8. Blue Line . Ibn 3aud, in his discussions witl Sir Andrew Ityan at Taif, had emphatically protested against any attempt on our part to regard him as bound by the provisions of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 which regulated the Eastern limits of Nejd and the boundaries in the Aden hinterland* Sir A. Kyam, on instructions,, had made it clear that as part of a satisfactory general settlement of the outstanding questions with Saudi Arabia we would be prepared to consider some minor modification of the ooundaries in question* luau Bey reiterated the claims which had been put forward by the' King in the Taif conversations. He was informed in reply that while we should oe quite willing to consider any reasonable claim xor modification put forward by Ibn Baud as part of a general settlement, the first essential was to have some idea of what precisely Ibn saud wanted. It transpired in the course of the discussion that Fuad himself was extremely vague as to the King's desiderata and indeed as to the geographical position in Eastern Arabia. He put forward a claim on behalf of/ 1 , V, It4 of Ibn Saud to the ivianasir and the A1 Iviurra tribes, but was wad'fed that, while the King might have some special position in regara to the Al hurra, the Lanasir had haa a long and close association with Abu Dhabi and that there might be serious difficulty about any Sauai claim to them. It was also made clear to him that claims to suzerainty extending aown to the w 4 ara mountains in South Eastern Arabia could not possibly be considered by H.M.G. It was agreed finally that Ibn Saud should indicate in greater detail the precise nature of his claims with a view to the matter being further considered. A separate submission is being made on this point on the file about the Blue Line, suffice it to say that Ibn Saud , . . . * has since indicated his readiness to accept as the southern boundary of i^atar the line recently claimed by the Sheikh himself, wnich runs across the base of the peninsula, but that it has proved impossible to secure any clear indication of his desiderata farther south. u Persia n Gulf points . The two most important of these are the Koweit blockade and the Bahrein r Transit Dues. As regards the Koweit blockade , the Foreign G±iice made it clear to Fuad Hamza that a satisfactory solution of this question was an essential condition of any general settlement and that the attitude which had been adopted in regard to it oy the oauui Government seemed to us impossible to justify. The Minister replied, in effect, that necessity knew no law, but accepted the desirability of a satisfactory settlement.

Ufjl 1 V ift importance to txie solution of this Question, (sir Andrew Cyan’s conversations at Tail make it clear that this is the case). Tne foreign Office, however took the line (which is that which has consistently been pressed by this Office ana the Government of India) that this was a matter which coula only satisfactorily be aiscussed, at any rate in trie first place, locally, but that if Idn Saud woula agree to the despatch of representatives with a view to discussion all possible assistance woula be given on our side. Fuad, with great reluctance, finally agreed to urge Ibn 3aua to reconsider his attitude on this point. 11. Miscellaneous points . On the question of slavery , the Sauais are very anxious to secure the abrogation of the rights of manumission which we enjoy under the Treaty of Jedda and which they regard - perhaps not unnaturally -as a derogation from their international status. Fuad Bey referrea, however,, to the real difficulties, partly religious, P art1 ^ economic, involved in any sweeping declaration on the SStet by Ibn 3aua. The Foreign Office gave him little reason to hope that we shoula be prepared to aoanaon our right of manumission unless some definite undertaking in regard to slavery coula be secured from the King. The minor questions of the reopening of the He jaz Railway ana the Jedda-Port Suaan__.cabie call for no special comment; nor does the warning given by the Foreign Office that we should probably in the near future be anxious to reach some understanding with the Sauai Government in regard to flights/ rMF' il's If* f 1 1 UrU U 8 . flights hy aircraft over Saudi-Arabia . As regards the outstanding debts of the daudis to this country, the suggestion was put forward that a loan might he floated here for trie purpose of repayment, which is under examination. 12. The general effect of the discussions with Fuad Hamza, read with the note of Sir A. Ryan’s conversations at Taif with Ihn Saua, is that Ibn Saud definitely anxious: (a) to consolidate his general position by establishing a closer entente with us, by establishing closer and more friendly relations with Iraq, if possible under our auspices, ana possibly by entering the League. The death of Feisul has removed his only effective competitor in the Arab world. (b) if possible, to improve his position vis-a-vis the Arab world by securing some whittling down at the expense of H.M.G. of the restrictions wnich we impose on his dealings withfqstal^and the Trucial Sheikhs^ana a formal recognition on our part oi extensive claims to tribal overlordship in the centre oi Arabia. So far, too, as he can continue without effective interference on our part to maintain his strangiehola on Koweit by refusing to relax tne Koweit olockaae and to have his way at the expense of. Bahrein over the Bahrein Transit Dues, he will no doubt endeavour to emphasise in Arabia that H.M.G. defer to him ana that it is to interests oi the Arab rulers to look to him rather than to H • M • G. ‘ ‘' e on our side, oi' course, are anxious for a friendly entente and ought to refuse no reasonable concession in order to secure it.

In these circumstances, it is important in any negotiations not to allow ourselves to he manoeuvred out of our special position vis-k-vis the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, to acquiesce in Ibn Saud’s claims to a general Arab hegemony or to accept exaggerated territorial claims on his part. We can meet him up to a point in regard to the Blue Line, and possibly over matters such as the Bahrein Transit Dues and the Hejaz Railway. But he on his side must meet us over the Koweit blockade; he must at any rate agree to local discussion of the Bahrein Transit Dues, and he must be content with concessions over the Blue Line which will keep him well away from the coast and will be consistent with the legitimate and historical claims of our proteges. It is unfortunate that the petty and tiresome question of the development of oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone may prejudicially affect the discussions, but this cannot be helped. The Saudis are themselves responsible for the present inipasse^, it is not in any special degree to our interest to help them out of it, and the negotiations which have now been initiated by the I.P.C. with a view to securing the elimination of the Standard Oil from Hasa and Bahrein, or at any rate to securing some participation in their marketing or exploiting operations, are an additional argument so far as we are concerned for delay. 14. I understand that the Foreign Office will raise in tiie immediate future'tiie question wiiether in the/the light.of the discussions which have taken place we should proceed with the proposal for formal negotiations at Jedda on Sir Andrew ftyan’s return. I suggest that matters have now got so far and that we have aone so much to arouse Saudi expectations that negotiations will he resumed on a more formal basis that it ifould hardly fail to effect our relations with Ibn Saud prejudicially were the suggestion now to be abandoned. It may well be that the negotiations will come to nothing, but there is much to be said for a general friendly discussion, particularly in view of Ibn Sana’s apparent anxiety Ik + : J to secure our general support and the apprehensions, ill-founded as they may be, which he appears to entertain of Turko-Persian hostility. If those apprehensions are real they may make him better disposed to meet us over the points in issue with H.M.Gr. than he would be in other circumstances. We might also take the line(that while a friendly understanding is desirable for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph we ought not to be prepared to pay too high a price for it, nor to be seriously disappointed if negotiations come to nothing. The drafting of Instructions may present some difficulty, as we still await information from the Gulf in connection with the Blue Line question and its receipt may be delayed for some time further, on this point, however, it seems open to Sir Andrew xtyan to press as a first stage for a clear intimation of Ibn Saud s desiderata and so^drag out discussion until we are better equipped to pursue it.laBPMKX i In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. ESVVX ^ ■i', and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. p y JL .

[E 5874/2429/25] No. 1. Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs), held at the Foreign Office on September 19, 1934. FUAD BEY HAMZA called on Mr. Rendel this morning accompanied by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Sir A. Ryan was also present, except at the beginning of the conversation. 2. Mr. Rendel drew Fuad Bey out on the subjects he wished to discuss, and elicited the fact that he regarded the question of the south-eastern fh tier of Saudi Arabia as being of special importance. 3. Fuad Bey dealt first, however, with the question of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He wished to know how His Majesty’s Government would view a tightening up of those relations in the common interest of two Arab countries, both of which were on specially friendly terms with His Majesty’s Government His Government had not made any definite approach to the Ii aqi Government^ but they had the possibility in view, always provided that His Majesty’s Government saw no objection. They did not wish to do anything contrary to His Majesty’s Government’s policy. 4. Mr. Rendel said that he would like to have a clearer view of what Fuad Bey had in mind. Speaking generally, and subject to the approval ot tlie Secretary of State, he said that His Majesty's Government would welcome any thing tending to promote concord and prosperity between the Arab states and would therefore view with sympathy any rapprochement between baud Arabia and Iraq which had for its object the promotion of peace m ^ I ' abla o f 1 , necessary to consider carefully the nature of any proposed understanding to ensure that it was consonant with the existing obligations of the P^Ges notabl} those of Iran under her Treaty of Alliance witn us and as a member ot tne League of Nations. He did not think, however, tha ‘^^““^“shhed barrier to a closer understanding between Saudi A , rablaaad Jp dhfHnrA that any points which might arise could be covered by suitable dra g-() 5. Sir A. Ryan concurred, adding, however, tbat f GtHHchluarantef Abdui Aziz had rather more in view and sought some sort o % of the proposed Saudi—Iraq understanding. 6. Fuad Bey said that this was of Hifldf jes’ty^GoTOrm guarantee, but wished merely to . as ? er h :i y landing would be suitable, whether, ment. He went on to ask what kind of ' nd “y al ?f 1 it or whether their for instance His Powt^ whfch would be kept informed position would be merely that or a tn , n a the tic interest, at intervals of what was passing and would take a sympathetic mte 7. Mr. Rendel explained, on the one hand, the objections of 013 uiv.-ih,. of the Secretary of Mate, that His 1 J j ra n subject to what he sympathy a rapprochement between aua existing obligations, but that,, had said about the need for harmomsi ^ information as the parties directly while they would be glad to receive s themselves parties to the concerned might give them, they would prefei not to understanding arrived at. • i .S hv the Foreign Office legal advisers in connexion p) This question has already been fully ^^pact. with an earlier proposal for a Perso-Iraqi non [206 t—1]8. Sir A. Ryan observed that it was all the more important to have a clear view, as express reference had been made in all the earlier discussions to two other Powers, non-Arab, with whom His Majesty's Government were also on terms of friendship, and who were neighbours of Iraq though not of Saudi Arabia. 9. Fuad Bey said that he had nothing to conceal. The two Powers just mentioned were Turkey and Persia. His Government were at present on quite friendly terms with both, and there was no aggressive motive behind their wish lor closer relations with Iraq. Nevertheless, the recent rapprochement between Turkey and Persia had inspired anxiety in all Arab countries. It was all the greater as a secular racial animosity existed between Arabs and both Turks and Persians. However correct relations might now be, his Government feared the ulterior designs of Turkey and Persia, about which they had a good deal of information. 10. Turkey favoured the maintenance of the French position in Syria, subject to her wish for a readjustment in her favour in the Alexandretta region. Mustafa Kemal Pasha had stated to a reliable informant that Turkey preferred to have two separate Powers on her southern border.( 2 ) There was no secret about Persian aspirations in the Persian Gulf, witness the claims she was asserting to Bahrein, &amp;c. Persia was growing more powerful, e.y., she now had six warships in the Gulf, where previously there had been none but British ships. Speaking as an Arab, Fuad Bey would like to see Bahrein develop into an independent Arab unit; in the meanwhile, he certainly did not wish to see Persia establish a claim, as against His Majesty’s Government. 11. Mr. Rendel said he did not think Persian claims to Bahrein need worry Fuad Bey, but that he understood the general anxiety of which he had spoken. At the same time such information as His Majesty’s Government possessed did not suggest that there was much danger in the rapprochement between Turkey and Persia, or that either Power had aggressive designs. Turkey had pursued a remarkably peaceful and non-aggressive policy for the last ten years. 12. Fuad Bey was impressed by the quick changes that came over the relations of States. In Europe he found a very different grouping from that of two years ago. He cited as one example the present closeness of the relations between France, Russia and Turkey. It had looked some months ago as though there were even more material for war than in 1914. Happily this danger had been averted, but there might again be quick changes; and similarly in the East, whatever tne present position, Turkey and Persia might become 'hostile to the Arabs. Any blow aimed by them at Iraq would, as the King had told Sir A. Ryan, menace Saudi Arabia indirectly. 13. This digiession was not further pursued. Fuad Bev said he under stood what Mr. Rendel had said regarding His Majesty’s Government’s attitude m icgard to the proposed rapprochement between Saudi and Iraq. He went on to ask what view would be taken of similar rapprochements with other Arab States. 14. 4/?. Rendel emphasised the importance which His Majesty’s Govern ment attach to a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. As regards th( smallei States on the Persian Gulf, however, he said that it would be of great importance to know clearly what sort of arrangements Fuad Bey had in mind as not the situation already sufficiently provided for under article 6 of thi treaty ot Jedda. His Majesty’s Government gave a very free hand to the rulers o ose ^tates m matters of local concern, but they were responsible for theii oieign a airs. Saudi Arabia was a great and powerful State compared with these minor sheikhdoms^ Might not closer relations with Ibn Saud end by making these Mates into something like satellites of the greater Power? His Majesty's Government would certainly not be able to acquiesce in any such development.' to. It was agreed to resume this discussion later. Asked what othei subjects he wished to raise, Fuad Bey again referred to the question of the south- ( 2 ) I took this to imply that he thought that Turkey woul Arabia, e.g.. between Syria and Iraq,—(Initialed) G.W.R, oppose any Arab combination in northerneastern frontier and mentioned in a general way what had passed between him and Sir A. Ryan about the position in regard to the Treaty of Jedda. It was agreed to discuss the frontier question to-morrow morning and Fuad Bey undertook to produce, after this had been done, a further Ust of subjects. 16. Sheikh Hafiz Wahha made no contribution to the discussion. Foreign Office, September 19, 1934. A. R.[206 u—1] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

THE meeting was attended by-— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs).. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel recalled that, at Fuad Bey’s request, it had been agreed on the previous day to begin the present discussion by examining the problem of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the Saudi Government were aware, His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the continued legal validity of the position established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914. They saw nothing to be gained, however, by pursuing the discussion on purely legal lines if there were any other means of reaching a satisfactory settlement; they realised that King Ibn Saud felt strongly on the subject; and they considered that a friendly adjustment of the matter should be possible. They were anxious for a friendly settlement of all outstanding questions with Kinp- Ibn Saud, but, in the first place, they would like to know more about King Ibn Sand’s own views on the frontier problem. His Majesty’s Government had certain important responsibilities east of the £ ‘ blue line,” which King Ibn Saud had recognised. It was desirable to establish some agreed boundary m the region in question; but, before going any further, it was necessary to have some idea of King Ibn Sand’s desiderata. Fuad Bey expressed his satisfaction at hearing that His Majesty’s Govern Fuad Bey then mentioned anothe that Ibn Saud did not wish to claim an Khali; but the point was not pursued BMr. Rendel repeated that, if His Majesty’s Government should find it possible to reach a satisfactory friendly agreement, they would not insist on the legal aspect of the matter; but, in saying this, what they had in mind was something more than an agreement on this one question; they desired, in fact, a general agreement which should cover a number of questions outstanding between the two Governments, for instance, the Koweit blockade. In regard to some of these questions, His Majesty’s Government would have certain desiderata; King Ibn Saud would no doubt have his own desiderata in other directions. If the frontier question could be satisfactorily settled as part of such a general agree ment, the legal position of His Majesty’s Government could be left on one side. His Majesty’s Government must, however, reserve their right to return to their legal claims if for any reason a general settlement were not found possible. The legal position, even if left in abeyance, remained unchanged, and His Majesty’s Government were still prepared, if necessary, to uphold the legal validity of the Sir A. Ryan concurred in this view. He added that, in pressing for a general settlement, His Majesty’s Government were following the lead given by King Ibn Saud himself, when he had suggested conversations with a view to clearing up his whole position vis-d-vis of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel suggested that the further examination of the frontier problem might be allowed to wait until Fuad Bey received the instructions which he was shortly expecting. Meanwhile, he felt bound to make it clear that there was m fact, a good reason why copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 had not been given to Ibn Saud after the Treaty of Jedda. King Ibn Saud had at that time merely asked for copies of the agreements between His Majesty’s Government and other Arab rulers. There had, therefore, been no question of supplying him with copies of agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government. In any case, the “ blue line ” was generally known and appeared on several published maps. Fuad Bey expiessed himself as hopeful of reachinp* a, sAtt.lpmpmf nf rmf_ Mr Rendel^ pointed out that in any general settlement, while problems were Turkish Government.[206 u—1] Mr. Rendel again urged that it would be much easier to merge the frontier question in a general settlement. He informed Fuad Bey that it was contem plated that Sir Andrew Ryan should embark on general negotiations on his return to Jedda, provided that it was possible to agree in principle to such negotiations now. Fuad 'Bey finally expressed willingness in principle to deal with the various outstanding problems on general lines, but explained that King Ibn Sand, who had made so many sacrifices in the past for the sake of good relations with His Majesty’s Government, could not be expected to make many further concessions now. Sir Andrew Ryan demurred to Fuad Bey’s suggestion that Ibn Sand had done nothing but make sacrifices to His Majesty’s Government. He had indeed accommodated his policy to theirs, but he had derived much benefit from their support. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the only sacrifices which both sides would be required to make in the projected general settlement would be such as might, on a long view, be expected to bring them compensating advantages in the end. It was not a case of altruism on either side. But in any general settlement between two Governments both sides usually had to give way over certain points. Meanwhile, he would be grateful if Fuad Bey could, on his part, outline the principal questions which King Ibn Baud might like to see included in a general settlement. So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, he had already mentioned their chief preoccupation, namely, the question of the Koweit blockade. It was their earnest wish to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit put on a really satisfactory basis, as had been done successively in the case of Saudi relations with Iraq and later with Transjordan. Fuad Bey stated that King Ibn Saud fully realised the desire of His W n sAttlpment of the blockade question, which had indeed a settlement. on this point regarding the relations between Gulf. prevail. JLli uiie ic^oxxu -—o text had been allowed to prevail. b 2Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that the first two points which had been mentioned, i.e., the question of slavery and that of the Akaba-Maan frontier were not, m fact, dealt with in the text of the Treaty of Jedda, but in exchanges of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, but, in fact, quite independent of it. These two questions, whatever might be decided about them need not therefore affect the future of the treaty. As regards the question of the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Gulf, which was dealt with m a general way in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, he considered that any more elaborate arrangements, which it might be necessary or desirable to make to govern future relations between Ibn Saud and the rulers of South-Eastern Arabia, would normally fall to be discussed in connexion with any arrangements that might be made regarding the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia He thought he ought perhaps to mention at this point that the Sultan of Muscat was more completely independent than the Trucial sheikhs, and that it might therefore be necessary for him to be brought in as a separate party to any eventual settlement He repeated, however, that the whole of this question seemed to him to tall to be dealt with together with that of the frontier. As legards the question of the prevailing language of any new agreement he said that this seemed to him to be a point of form which should not be allowed to interfere with the political issues involved. In point of fact, the departure from precedent which had been agreed to in the case of the recent treaty with the Yemen was due to the unique circumstance that the Yemen was so out of touch with civilisation elsewhere that no one could be found in that eountrv with any adequate knowledge of any European language. Unique conditions requiied unique treatment. Saudi Arabia was in a very different position i? l 30 ^’ ] ll0 ^ ev ® r ’ m volved rather complicated questions of precedent &amp;c and had better be dealt with quite independently of the political issues. Mr. Rendel then proceeded to deal with the question of slavery He explained that this question was one of great importance, on which public sentiment in this country was extremely strong. England had played a very remarkable part in the abolition of the institution of slavery, and public opinion here would never tolerate any step which might be regarded as a step in the wrong direction If any new arrangements were to be made on this point, therefore, it must be W te if ea V ha u f f eir ef l e f WOuld be t0 hasten and not to retard the inevitable and ultimate abolition of slavery as an institution. He felt sure that Fuad Eev and indeed King Ibn Saud hnnself, were sufficiently enlightened to realse S iUnyUunTrvTbnf U b tl0n h as fu ' da t mentall y and was doomed to extinction the ifatffins nf th (f hope h make true progress and to play a worthy part among the nations of the world He could say categorically, therefore; that Hi! Majesty s Government would not be able to agree to any new arrangement which did not fit m with these principles. The question was of such imp“ce' f could not in any case do more than hear and take note of any proposals which Fuad Bey might wish to make. If, howeyer. King Ibn Sau5 should wS to propose some arrangement the effect of which would be not to retard but to accelerate the abolition or at any rate the reduction of slavery he felt sure it the U matter eXamin8&lt;1 Wlth ^ possible consideration for the King’s position in slaves cefs^tot^mnn^ed 11 'ru S q Ve g WC ! l ; ld sooner or later ceas e when A At, c • i 6 im P or l ,ed - King ibn Saud could, however proceed no further than the social and economic state of his kingdom would allow Furth!! he had to make allowances for the fact that Islamic law permitted slavery Stem might nevertheless, be taken to limit the number of slaves in such a wav that an slavery HnihhAoU Umber TA eventuall y lea d to the total extinction of slavery. He alluded once again to the recent Anglo-Yemeni treaty spttEmpni intoIiiAerritorv H mmM ^ ndertak f n f no y to Aw the imporLtTon of Tfes taking of that naturAfd ^ OSSlble f or Km S Ibn Saud to give some under- those Slaves wtwAalrLdUnlaudrA/aJaf^ St6PS t0 the ‘ 0t ° f Mr. Rendel said that it would of pourqp Q ~ Kino- Thn Sanr! r-nnOi i y course, make a great difference if 0 ibn baud could take any such steps within his own dominions. AparAfromTinT’fUs^d- Am T’ 6 great difficulties attending such action. ^ ° ' ba ‘ K * s cMiculties with his own public opinion, it was5 % \ essential that, if he were to maintain his prestige, his action should not be capable of being represented as dictated by external pressure. He suggested that it should be left to King Ibn Saud to take appropriate action as a matter of internal policy. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully realised these ^difficulties, but that they did not seem to him insuperable. A prohibition of the importation of slaves would, of course, be a great step forward. But this would not really affect the question of the institution of slavery, since the existing slave population was large enough, he understood, to maintain the supply of slaves for an indefinite period. If, therefore, Ibn Saud could take some steps with a view to the gradual reduction of the number of born slaves, it would be more useful still. Some concession, such as that which Fuad Bey had himself suggested, providing for the emancipation of slaves who were maltreated or discontented with their lot, would be an enormous step forward. Such a measure would, of course, for the reasons which had just been discussed, have to be taken by Ibn Saud on his own initiative. But if it were actually taken, it might make it much easier for His Majesty’s Government to make some concession in return. He suggested, as a personal and unofficial suggestion of his own, that by far the best solution would be for Ibn Saud spontaneously to take some action in the sense proposed, in advance of any concession by His Majesty’s Government. Any concession which His Majesty’s Government might agree to make could then be made subsequently, in specific recognition of the fact that Ibn Saud had taken the measures in question. This might create an excellent impression here, and might justify some modification of the present arrangements. Mr. Rendel repeated, however, that he could give no undertaking at this stage as to what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would be. Fuad Bey thought that something on these lines might be possible, but that Ibn Saud would certainly require some guarantee from His Majesty’s Govern ment in advance that, if he took the action proposed, His Majesty’s Government would subsequently make the desired concession. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty’s Government were being asked to abandon an existing right. It would be necessary to justify any such abandonment to opinion in this country, which, on this subject, was very strong, to a wider British opinion, including that of many Moslems, and to international opinion. It would not suffice for such justification to rely merely on an assurance of Ibn Saud’s good intentions. It would be necessary to know what definite action he contemplated to prevent the slave trade and to mitigate the lot of slaves actually suffering from hardship. Although the lot of slaves generally in Saudi Arabia might be fortunate, there were, in fact, instances of oppressive slavery. He cited as an example the facility with which slave husbands and wives could be separated. It was decided to pursue this matter at a later meeting. Before leaving, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned four points which he would wish to pursue with His Majesty’s Government during the following discussions. These were (1) The Hejaz Railway. (2) The cable line between Jedda and Port Sudan. (3) The Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession. (4) Bahrein transit dues.

Section 1. No. 1. [E 5957/2429/25] Record of Third Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza held at the Foreign Office on . September 21, 1934. THE following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Saudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs.. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Saudi-Arabian Minister in London. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel suggested that the meeting should consider in order the various points to which Fuad Bey had referred at the end of the previous day’s meeting. The first of these was the question of Aqaba and Maan. Mr. Rendel was not altogether clear as to Fuad Bey’s object in raising this question. The present position between the two Governments rested on the first exchange of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, which provided for the maintenance of the de facto frontier. He understood that Fuad Bey had recently stated to Sir A. Ryan at Jedda that the Saudi Government were not seeking to disturb this arrangement. Sir A. Ryan added that he understood that the Saudi Government main tained their previous attitude of reserve towards this question, but that they did not consider the present time propitious for reopening it. Fuad Bey explained that for various reasons, both political and religious, his Government were unable to accept the separation of the viqaba-Maan district from the Hejaz. They would always be ready to discuss this question on this basis, but if His Majesty’s Government did not consider the present moment opportune for reopening it, the Saudi Government had on their side no wish to raise it. Failing a further discussion and a new settlement, the Saudi Govern ment were prepared to preserve the existing arrangement. Mr. Rendel said that there would, of course, have been advantages—if there were to be any general clearing up of outstanding questions-m reaching a permanent settlement on this particular point also. 1 woii m nld be no to establish a clear and definitive frontier in this area. u thp main issue question of His Majesty’s Government modifying their att ^ de ^ ^ he “ ed of the future of Aqaba and Maan, and if the haudi G ^ j 3 as i s to consider any suggestion for a permanent an d e m iv advantage in of the present de facto situation, there would cei a ^ r ” p ss. .h™ .. i» —nsstsstsass definition of the frontier at various points on e carding Aqaba- and Saudi Arabia.

Mr. ^ 0 io ™dan authorities; but, speaking quite point pending consultation with the Tra ] worth taking the opportunity personally and unofficially, he thought lt irL h? n ^ oca i uncertainties that of the proposed general settlement to try ^ dispose of any might exist as to the precise definition o ne ^ n which had create d Sir A. Ryan gave as instances of t H? ^ th Saudi Government difficulty in this yirection, the fomer ATbeen acknowledged to be in regarding the position of Haditna, w B 206 x- -1]Saudi territory, and the present difference over Hazim, which'the Transjordan authorities considered as indisputably in Transjordan. Mr. Rendel put forward personally and unofficially a tentative suggestion that some of these points might be disposed of by some kind of local technical frontier commission. He explained, however, that this suggestion was naturally subject to the views of the Transjordan authorities, and that it might be found to be open to unexpected difficulties. Fuad Bey received this suggestion with partial assent. He agreed that a . clarification of the position in regard to the Transjordan-Nejd frontier— e.q. by the appointment of a frontier or delimitation commission—might well be 'dealt with m the proposed general negotiations. On the other hand, if the question of tne future of Aqaba and Maan were to be left in abeyance, his Government would iiave difficulty in touching in any way whatsoever the subject of the frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. Mr. Rendel agreed that King Ibn Baud was free to maintain the position which he had taken up in 1927 on this subject, and thought that His Majesty’s Government would, in these circumstances, probably be content to continue on tne present basis, and not to press for any more formal recognition of the existing frontier. It would, however, be necessary to consult the various departments of Iis Majesty s Government concerned and the local authorities before saying any thing more definite. Meanwhile, two points appeared to have emerged from the present discussion : (1) King Ibn Baud was not yet prepared to crystallise the present de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz; (2) there might be certain advantages in including in the proposed negotiations for a general settle ment some arrangement for the clarification of any points connected with the ransjordan Aejd frontier, regarding which there was any local uncertainty^ 1 ) I he next subject which came up for discussion was the Hejaz Railway. whiJAf hUa enq “ r ® d G yews of His Majesty’s Government on the proposal eh he had made to Sir A.

Fuad Bey explained that the matter had hitherto only been dealt with unofficially. If His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept the Saudi suggestion, his Government contemplated addressing an official note on the whole subject to both the Butish and French Governments, and proposing therein a technical conference on the lines he had indicated. It was agreed that the next step was for His Majesty’s Government to reply to the outstanding Saudi enquiry, which could not, however, be done until the views of the Transjordan authorities had been obtained. The next subject on Fuad Bey’s list was the question of telegraphic and wireless communication between Saudi Arabia and the outer world, with particular reference to the provisions of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement, Fuad Bey recalled the fact that the Saudi Government were debarred by article 6 of this agreement from using their wireless stations in the Hejaz for the purpose of communication with other countries. When the agreement had been signed there were two separate Governments, in the Hejaz and in Nejd, and the agreement had been interpreted as applying to the Hejaz only. The situation had now greatly changed in every respect; and the Saudi Government were finding it exceedingly inconvenient to be obliged to send all telegraphic communications from the Hejaz by the Port Sudan cable. A French company, the Radio Orient, and various Italian interests had also approached the Saudi Government in the matter. Sir A. Ryan recalled that the working agreement had been entered into by the Sudan and Hejaz Governments jointly as joint owners, and by the Eastern Telegraph Company as workers, of the cable. The agreement was terminable on two years’ notice, to be given either by both joint owners or by the company. Fuad Bey said that an exchange of notes had taken place between the Sudan and Saudi Governments arranging that if the Saudi Government should approach the Sudan Government with a view to the termination of the agreement, the Sudan Government would agree to join in giving the required notice. Sir A. Ryan stated that the interpretation of the agreement had in the past given rise to various legal difficulties which had not, however, been pui sued, as the amalgamation of the Eastern Telegraph Company with Marconis seemed to have simplified the problem. On the Persian Gulf side, however, a somewhat similar problem had arisen over the question of communications between asa and Bahrein. Conversations had taken place between King Ibn baud, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sir H. Biscoe in 1932. No advance had been made, and the matter had lain dormant for some time, but had lately been revived and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda had been instructed to revert to it with the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey Hamza also raised the question of the charges on the cable. It was agreed, however, that the question of the interpretation of the Jedda-Poit Sudan Cable Agreement and of Saudi wireless cmnmumca io dj , countries was a very technical one and one m which 1 a «K T . would be in the United Kingdom were not very ec ^y ^onle^ preferable, therefore, that this question should not be^ ea ^ 1 meeting general settlement.

[206 x—1] b 24 The next subject discussed was the Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession. Fuad Bey recapitulated The position of the Saudi Government vis-d-vis the Standard Oil Company of California in regard to the option which had been -given them in connexion with this concession. After a short discussion, however it was agreed to postpone further examination of this matter until the following week, when an India Office expert on this question would be available to join in the discussion. J 16. Finally, the question of the Bahrein Transit Dues was raised. Fuad &gt;&gt;ey explained that there were two difficulties confronting his Government in this matter: firstly, the question of the transit dues themselves; and, secondly the question of direct shipments to the Hasa coast. As regards the first of these’ the baudi Government feared that the Bahrein Government were about to raise the dues, if they had not already done so. They considered, moreover, that anv consignments addressed either to King Ibn Saud or to the Saudi Government should be exempted from dues. . Fir Andrew Ryan stated that for some time past the negotiations on tns subject had been transferred to London, and that, although he had been ivept miormed, he had not been directly concerned in this matter, until during his recent audience with King Ibn Saud at Taif the King had raised with him the question of direct shipments. He pointed out that it was scarcely fair of the Saudi Government both to demand that the Bahrein Government should reduce the rates of the dues and at the same time endeavour to kill the Bahrein transit trade. Bahrein must live. fnllv Mtr.Rendel stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already represented iully at the Foreign Office the views of his Government on this subject. His Su l 3 Go t v f n “ e y. . for their Part, had suggested that a Saudi delegation shmld be sent to Bahrein to examine whether the issue between the Saudi and Bahrein Governments could not be narrowed down if not removed altogether questmFthlt tbeS^H'T 8 ’ “ ^ the “ ost practical means of settling this question that the Saudi Government could not prejudice their case bv sendlno- such a delegation, and that if the discussions should fail they would stfll be free o pursue the matter with His Majesty’s Government direct. The question particularly as regards the dues, was a complicated and technical one where local data would be necessary, and which could be dealt with far more effectivelv on the spot than m London or in Jedda. He felt snrp thGt i i A- would d ° much to clear the air, even if it did not lead to a final settlement 6 and he suggested that preliminary discussions of this nature might well take nlace at once. Sn A. Ryan would not be back m Jedda until December so there^was p enty of time to explore the ground locally meanwhile. If the proposed W1 discussions should lead to nothing and tW P iP f? i 1 reasonable grounds for considering^’the attitude of it. ^2. ^ nmen ^ should have be unreasonable, lt would stlu be ^sfbffi totkAt matTktoT^f ‘f the general discussions with Sir A.

Mr. Rendel saw nothing to be lost and much ‘ from the proposed local discussions. to be gained Fuad Bey explained that he could not depart from his instructions on this question. He undertook, however, to suggest once more to the Kino- the possibility of local discussion at Bahrein and to put to His Maiestl the arguments which had been used. He quite realised that Bahrein must find some means of economic existence, but such an existence should not be parasitic. If Bahrein wished to live by its transit dues, it must give reasonable facilities. This would not^ be the case if the transit dues were raised, and in any case King Ibn baud felt stiongly that goods consigned to himself and his Government should be exempted. Mr. Rendel said that so far as he was aware it was not m accordance with geneial practice to exempt from transit dues stores destined for a foreicn Government. ft Sir Andrew Ryan stated that His Majesty’s IGovernment had always been ready to give liberal treatment to stores destined for the actual use of King Ibn baud. The economy of Nejd, however, was of a peculiar kind, and there seemed no good reason why stores which were, for instance, imported for the use of tribes should be exempted from transit dues. Fuad Hamza then reverted to the question of direct shipments to Hasa. He emphasised the importance which King Ibn baud attached to this, and added that local interests in baudi Arabia, Basra, and even Persia were now considering the possibility of forming some independent navigation company, in view of the pressure which had been brought to bear on the British India Company not to make any shipments to the Hasa direct. Sir A . Ryan urged on the baudi representatives the importance of dispelling from the King’s mind the idea that His Majesty’s Government were trying to force him into economic dependence on Bahrein, and Mr. Rendel repeated that His Majesty’s Government had no wish to bring about a boycott or blockade of the Hasa coast. In conclusion, Mr. Rendel mentioned that His Majesty’s Government might wish, in the course of any general negotiations, to revive the question of the passage of aircraft over baudi Arabia. The question, which had often been discussed before, was, in one sense, one of diminishing importance, since the actual extent of the baudi coastline on the Persian Gulf was small and the radius and reliability of aircraft were steadily increasing. It was, of course, against the policy of His Majesty’s Government to make the regular passage of aircraft over any particular country subject to financial payments. It was clear that, once such a principle were established, there would be no end to it, and that freedom of air communications all over the world would be greatly interfered with. But there would be certain advantages if some agreement could be come to with a view to facilitating the passage of aircraft o\ei King Ibn baud’s territory. , The question of dealing with the matter in connexion with the proposed general settlement had not vet been fully considered, but Mr. Rendel thought it well to make it clear at once that His Majesty’s Government might eventually wish to raise it, lest, if it were left over and only mentioned later they should be regarded as endeavouring at the last moment to include new subjects m e general settlement and thereby altering its scope. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty’s Government might wish to idd certain subjects to the list of those to be reviewed duimg ua ey s y o London. He mentioned in particular the question of the Goyermnent of mdia’s dispensary in the Hejaz. It was agreed that Sir A. &gt; an , j’ l f L his question, and possibly certain other minor matters, with Fuad iaudi Minister on the morning of the 24th September It was agreed that he next general conversation should take place on e c !4th September, after Fuad Bey had seen the Secretary of State.

[E 5996/2429/25] V- \ ; J No. 1 . Fourth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on the September 24, 1934. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. FUAD BEY, accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, came to see me this morning in accordance with the arrangement made at the third conversation, that we should discuss separately the question of the Government of India’s dispensaries in the Hejaz and possibly other minor questions. 2. I explained to Fuad Bey that the question of the dispensaries, though important, was non-political and concerned the Indian authorities. Mr. Eendel had therefore asked me to go into the matter with himself and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. I reminded Fuad Bey that when he and I last discussed the question in Jedda we had seemed to be approaching a solution, but the discussion had been interrupted by his illness. The matter had now taken a new and less favourable turn, as the Saudi Government had addressed a circular to Mr Calvert, in which they had asked for separate statements of medical supplies imported for the use of members of the Legation and those imported for general dispensary use, in order that customs duty should be levied on the latter. I read to him the main portions of the telegraphic correspondence, and said that there appeared to be two miscon ceptions, viz., (a) the Saudi Government seemed to think that medical supplies not intended for the use of the Legation staff were sold to the public, whereas m fact, the quantities of medicine supplied in return for payment were negligible, and (h) they seemed to think that Fuad Bey and I had dealt only with the status of the Indian medical officers, whereas we had, in fact, dealt with the whole question of the dispensaries. . 3 1 urged that the Saudi Government should not try to force the issue b&gt; assuming that stores, other than those for the use of the members of the Legation were liable to duty. The Jedda dispensary had existed for some fifty years, and had always enjoyed immunity as part of the British mission. Turkish Government had exempted from duty supplies imported by foreig charitable institutions as such, not only those for diplomatic use The branch dispensary at Mecca had been opened with Ibn Saud s ^ Theie was, I admitted, no written record of this, as the y^ngement had been made between the King and the Indian vice-consul, but th ® King’s attitude at that time was that for the first year he ^ free of rent for the dispensary at Mecca. I was piep &gt; ’ j|| | ut question on the lines foreshadowed m my discussion w th Fuad ®t Jedda^ I could not admit, pending a settlement, that supp le „ ( • enmle[Jt ti0 liable to customs duty, and I deprecated the attempt of the Sa enforce their own view in this respect before the ® gouM out. The case was a unique one, and while not claiming that the be claimed under general international usage, there were strong maintaining U^ey ^ no reli couU be placed on ear^ as the Treaty of Jedda had swept away a s P relations were to be Treaty of Jedda had not done this but law took great account of based on principles of international law - , | ut]on 0 f t h e whole question, established custom.

Fuad Bey said that he had had u ° thi y id Lat I was making a definite ment, and was not in a position to dlS( Y® . seaso n should be exempted from proposal, i.e., that the stores for next pilgi image seasoi2 duty and the general discussion pursued at leisure. This could, if necessary, be pursued with Mr. Calvert, but I should prefer to leave it until Fuad Bey and I could deal with the matter on our reurn to Jedda. Fuad Bey noted my proposal. 6. I used various arguments, which need not be recorded in detail, to impress on Fuad Bey the importance of this question, urging inter alia that the Saudi Government should take account of the great services rendered by the dispensaries. They supplied wants which the Saudi Government were not as yet in a position to satisfy, and the Saudi Government should not make their position impossible by attempting to exercise excessive control or by adding customs duty to the expenditure entailed, the amount of which was already worrying the Government of India. 7. I told Fuad Bey that this was the most important of the small number of questions which I had suggested adding to the list of those already discussed with Mr. Rendel and myself. I need only advert to two others, viz., the pecuniary claims of His Majesty’s Government against the Saudi Government, and the position as regards British nationality in Saudi Arabia. The latter question seemed to be progressing on satisfactory lines and I would not pursue it. I did not wish at this moment to pursue definitely the question of the two debts of the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government, but I reminded Fuad Bey that we were very anxious to dispose of the matter, which was one on which we were faced with strong insistence on the part of the Treasury. I recalled our proposal that the trivial MacDonnell debt should be settled out of hand, and the liquidation of the larger debt placed on a business basis. I added that I had induced His Majesty’s Government to postpone the matter pending a clearing up of the situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. That situation had now been liquidated, and I had again reminded Sheikh Yussuf Yasin of the debts shortly before leaving Jedda. J 8. Fuad Bey threw out a personal suggestion that perhaps His Majesty’s Government might now see their way to promote the flotation of a small loan in this country, sufficient to enable the floating debt of his Government to be paid off He outlined m very general terms a scheme for the issue of bonds. I received this suggestion very guardedly, but promised to report it. I explained that the matter was outside my sphere and that I could not judge of the possibilities, rough 1 had no reason to think that the prospect of raising money for Saudi Arabia would be any better now than it had been in 1932. Ju- C0I l c l us i 0I b I Fuad Bey, with reference to what had passed at the third meeting about the Jedda-Port Sudan cable, that there was no hope of bringing any adequately equipped representative of the Sudan Government into a discussion of the matter before he left London. I had, however, just seen a !&gt;?Im e T 7 Ilt ^ tl iI e ° f S?: b 6 an ^ Wirel f ss (Limited), and had suggested that he should meet huad Bey^ This gentleman had agreed, subject to the reservation that any proposals which might emerge would have to be submitted to the board of the company. The question of Saudi telegraphic communications had arisen in three aspects, viz., cable rates, the position in regard to the present working agreement HeT/A th6 C u b n thB Govei ”t of the Sudanand the mS? I f t!r ? as * er “ Telegraph Company, and the wish of the Saudi Govern- ment to establish wireless communication between Hasa and the outer world.

Summary of Discussion at Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 24, 1934. IT had originally been arranged to continue at this meeting the discussion begun at the second meeting (E 5908) regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The instructions which Euad Bey had been expecting in regard to this question had not, however, arrived, and it was not possible to make any further progress with it. It was arranged that, if these instructions did not arrive before Fuad Bey’s departure from England, Sheikh Hafiz would, on their receipt, acquaint the Foreign Office with their tenor. 2. Mr. Rendel asked that the E'oreign Office might be given as full an account as possible of King Ibn Sand’s views on the frontier problem well in advance of the opening of the proposed negotiations at Jedda. This would save a good deal of delay and reference home when the negotiations began. He added that he did not wish to begin by seeming over-optimistic with regard to the negotiations over this particular question. There were certain to be many points in regard to which the two sides would not see eye to eye. For instance, Euad Bey had at the second meeting mentioned the Murra and Manasir as tribes which King Ibn Saud was likely to claim as his subjects. So far as the Murra were concerned, there was perhaps some reason to consider that they were closely connected with Saudi Arabia. The Manasir, on the other hand, seemed to be of more doubtful allegiance, and were stated to be largely dependent on the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Again, Fuad Bey had mentioned a claim as far south as the Qara Mountains. His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be able to agree to anything so extensive. He mentioned these points to show that all would not necessarily be plain sailing. He was confident, however, that a friendly and reasonable settlement could be reached, and Sir A. Ryan would certainly make every effort to reach one, though he would necessarily be bound on many points by his instructions from home. Fuad Bey stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba would also be available to help in the negotiations m Jedda, since he was proceeding on leave to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year. 3. In the discussion which followed, an opportunity was taken to remind Fuad Bey that the chief desideratum on the side of His Majesty s Gmeinment in any general settlement would be a satisfactory se emei c^ o commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Kowei ; JW t the nrablem at one point that it might be better to balance this ques ion . » ' i , r of the oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, rather ^““““kue the south-eastern frontier. He was, however, given no ^ this line of thought. Sir Andrew Evan observed that a general settlement shot Id be of the greatest advantage to King Ibn Sau m pi s consolidating his^regmm in Arabia^ ^ but lt cl that Fuad Bey was not in a position to add anything XkkvTbn Sakdls kould previously said regarding the possibility of sue a fh P j r nresent right of justify His Majesty’s Government m renouncing then piesent ngnt manumission. meeting Fuad Bey mentioned that his Government o.

Record of Conversations during. Sir A. Ryan's Visit to Taif, July 12-14, 1934.— (Received in Foreign Office, August 3.) WHEN Sheikh Yussuf Yasin met me outside the town on the 12th July, he spoke to me briefly about the King’s reasons for wishing to see me. In the first place, the King had received other foreign representatives in Taif, and he wished to see also the British representative. Indeed, he hoped for an opportunity of receiving me at Riadh as well, where he had seen no British representatives for a long time, although he had met them elsewhere. The King also wished to take this opportunity of explaining his views on certain matters, notably the position to the north of his country, with special reference to Iraq, and the question of his frontiers. I expressed my gratitude to His Majesty for having enabled me to see him at Taif, and said that I had taken the instructions of my Government immediately on receiving his invitation, and had been directed to ascertain the King’s views on the matters that interested him, in order to be able to report on them at home. My Government had drawn my special attention to two matters, one of which Sheikh Yussuf had mentioned, viz., frontiers, the other that of Saudi relations with Koweit. 2. My audience with the King in the evening of the 12th July was almost entirely formal. On my thanking the King for his invitation and all the kindness I had been shown, he referred very pointedly to his hope of seeing me in Riadh also, perhaps after next Ramadan, if the rains were good. The only other matter of interest mentioned was the fact that the return of the heir apparent was delayed, as Seyfal Islam Ahmed had been prevented from completing the return of hostages by trouble with rebellious Yemeni tribes. I gathered from Mr. Philby later in the evening that the news of trouble inland in the Yemen had created some stir in high Saudi circles. Incidentally, Mr. Philby spoke as an unrepentant critic of the recent peace settlement and a non-believer in its permanence. He believed still that the King had got some money payment and an assurance that the administration of the Yemen Tihama would be left m the hands of Abdullah-al-Wazir for not less than a year. 3. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me at 8 a.m. on the 13th July, in accordance with my suggestion that we should have a talk before I discussed serious affairs with the King. I gave him a general outline of my instructions, emphasising the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to cement their relations with Ibn Saud, their belief that a closer relationship could best be attained by the friendly settlement of outstanding questions, of which the most important were those mentioned above; their willingness to engage in conversations about these questions; and their wish to be informed as to the King s desiderata. 1 tried to sound Sheikh Yussuf as to whether Fuad Bey could be empowered to hold conversations in London, saying that, if so, His Majesty s Government ha expressed readiness to hear him, or whether the Saudi Government would prefer that the questions should be discussed on my return, after preparation m e interval. Sheikh Yussuf thanked me for my statement and my assurances ot the friendly dispositions of His Majesty’s Government, but said tha , as e King wished to see me early and could not keep me after 10 a.m., e pre erre not to comment on what I had said. He delivered a message from the King,, asking me to convey to His Majesty’s Government and the naval authorities an expression of his appreciation of the helpful attitude of ^e c omman ers o e Red Sea sloops during the occupation of Hodeida. I responded smtabiy sayi g that the reports of the officers in question had contained constant references to the gracious kindness of the Amir Feisal and the excellence o with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, &amp;c. [181 c—1]4. The King received me at 9 a.m. I was accompanied as before by Mr. Furlonge and Ismail Effendi, who interpreted. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin was in attendance. 5. After compliments, I said that my Government had wished me to take the first opportunity of expressing to the King in person the great pleasure with which they had heard of the Saudi-Yemen settlement and their sense of th^y wisdom which His Majesty had shown in dealing with that matter. The King observed that he desired peace with all his neighbours, firstly, because they were Arabs, and secondly, because there was nothing to divide them. Relying, as he always did, on the friendship of His Majesty’s Government, he had sought their advice. It accorded with his own views, and he had acted on it. I said that His Majesty’s Government believed the settlement to be in the best interest of Arabia and gave the credit for it to the King, who had shown firmness, and had known how to show moderation as well in the last phase. 6. The King’s repeated affirmation of his friendship for His Majesty’s Government gave me the opportunity of saying that it was a primary point in my instructions that I was to reaffirm their friendly dispositions, which were unchanged and unchangeable, towards him and his country. I referred to the importance of removing all possible obstacles to complete friendship by settling certain questions, and to the wish of His Majesty’s Government to be informed as to the desiderata of the King. 7. The King started with the subject of Iraq. His statements were long and involved, but his drift was clear. He thought that all the Arab States needed some outside Power to rely on, and, though there were other friends, that Power should be Great Britain, who was in close relations with all of the States concerned. He was worried lest Iraq, the strongest of the Arab States, should be attacked by Turkey and/or Persia, and lest he should be menaced through Iraq as a result. He observed that he was currently supposed to be hostile to the ruling family of Iraq, but the truth was that he had nothing against them. He desired their interest as well as his own. If the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq were such as to secure Iraq against the attacks he feared, he would be easy in his mind. When Fuad Bey had spoken of an Arab alliance, he had had in mind some arrangement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia to ensure their mutual safety. The King intimated that he would like to see some such arrangement arrived at under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, the friend of both. 8. I explained that my conversations with Fuad Bey, which had not been completed owing to his illness, had not carried us quite as far as the King suggested, e.g., he had not used the word £ ‘alliance” in connexion with Iraq. I was all the more anxious to ascertain the King’s exact meaning, in order that I might convey his ideas in a definite form to my Government. I gathered from his statement that he had in mind three possible things in connexion with the dangers he feared . (ci) He had said that he would be easy in his mind, if assured that the ariangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq sufficed to safeguard the latter; (b) he had spoken of the possibility of some sort of alliance or defensive treaty between him and Iraq; (c) he had spoken as though he contemplated some sort of an alliance to which His Majesty’s Government could be a party. r n ^he King did not demur to my analysis. After some further exchanges, 1 observed that point (c) was the only one on which I could speak. His Majesty’s Government were animated in regard to the Arab States by a desire to see them prosper and by the friendly sentiments of which we had spoken, but it was contrary to their general policy to enter into alliances except in very special cases 3as elr the re res y nW oY W “ “i? n ° f Allknce,” b/t that alliance was the lesultant of a process by which Iraq had evolved from her Turkish proyinda! status, through British occupation and subsequent dependence on Hm e Brif “ 10. The King said that he was not insistino- Majesty’s Government. Their firm Sien^h^^S g^aslny aUiaT^ redefined his ideas m terms which amounted to this : that he would like to come to an arrangement with Iraq, under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government3 I ! 4 by which they would stand together, and which would be supported by an under taking, to be subscribed to by both the parties, that they would not stand against Great Britain or support any Power who went against her. He considered that such an arrangement would achieve his own object and would serve the interests of His Majesty’s Government. ^ 11. At 3-30 I called on the Amir Khalid, as Acting President of the ^Council. This visit was purely formal. The Prince was shy but self-possessed, and made mild efforts at conversation. 12. The King received me again at 4 p.m. After compliments, I said that I hoped for a fuither expression of his views. He replied that he had nothing more to say. In view of what Sheikh Yussuf had told me, this was obviously merely a device for throwing on us the onus of initiating the discussion of the frontier question. I therefore said that one of the outstanding questions which His Majesty s Government desired to see settled was that of his eastern boundaries. I explained how convinced His Majesty’s Government were that the only legal basis was that resulting from the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. The King, I said, now ruled what had been a part of the Ottoman Empire, and had succeeded to the position of the former Turkish Government. If this thesis, to which His Majesty’s Government held strongly, was admitted, they would be prepared to consider modifications of the legal frontier. I must, however, make it clear that what they had in view was minor modifications, a qualification rendered necessary by the comprehensiveness of the claims put forward in the last Saudi note in regard to Qatar and the country towards Muscat and Oman. 13. This started the King in a most vehement statement. Catching on to the mention of Qatar, Muscat and Oman, he said that he might well claim all these places as really his. He scouted the idea that the coastal principalities represented true sovereignties. They owed their existence to people who came from over the sea for trading purposes. He was not, however, he explained care fully, claiming them now, as he had entered into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government regarding them. He was not going back on that agreement, even though his rule would be welcomed in the coastal areas themselves. He merely cited the more extensive claims, which would be justified but for that agreement, in support of what he did claim, viz., authority over tribes like the Murra, an authority extending from Hhafra all the way, I gathered, to the hinterland of Oman. He denied the justice of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, even though they should insist on it, and he should be compelled to yield. 14. I cannot reproduce in an exact form what the King said, but the foregoing paragraph gives the main lines of his thesis, which, as regards his ancestral claims, he supported by the following arguments, interspersed in his discourse :— \h (a) His historical claim to Qatar, Muscat and Oman, which he had renounced, was borne out by what had passed between one of his predecessors and Colonel Felly. He spoke of a treaty or agreement as having been reached at that time. He was obviously speaking from general recollection, and was not even certain of Colonel Felly’s exact name, but he was quite positive that Colonel Felly had recognised a very extensive Saudi authority. (b) When Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Thani of Qatar had quarrelled (perhaps some forty years ago, but no exact date was mentioned), one of them had appealed to the then Ibn Saud for assistance, and the then Ibn Saud had composed the quarrel. (c) He admitted that in his early days, Ibn Rashid had held Riadh and the Turks, Hasa. Even then Turkish authority did not extend further. They had never ruled the Murra, &amp;c., and had at one moment requested him to use his authority over the tribes, whereupon he had sent fUA^o persons, whom he named, to control them. He denied absolutely the f^fb right of the Turks to alienate his ancestral rights. /ro' irv' 15. I observed that the King had himself come to an agreement with the Turks, by which he recognised their sovereignty. He did not deny this, but said that what he had done had been done under Bi itish advice given b} Captain Shakespear, presumably under instructions. [181 c—1] B 24 16. Towards the end the King expressed his surprise on learning that the Turks had agreed to alienate rights, which were not in their lawful disposal. He denied all knowledge until recently of the Anglo-Turkish conventions. I said that surely the Saudi Government had been aware of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention of 1913, which, if I remembered rightly, was referred to specifically in the Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922. Both the King andj^ Sheikh Yussuf were positive that they had no previous knowledge of the con-~ ventions of 1913-14, and made the point that they were not among the treaties communicated to Ibn Saud after the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. Sheikh Yussuf recalled a reference to the old Koweit boundary in the Koweit- Nejd Boundary Agreement of 1922, but did not think that the Anglo-Turkish Convention as such was referred to (I subsequently verified my own recollection, which was correct). 17. I did not feel that I could invite the King to make a further com munication to His Majesty’s Government during my absence on leave, as suggested in my instructions, having regard to the fact that the last official note of the Saudi Government remains unanswered, and to the extreme vigour of the King’s personal reaction. I promised to report all that he had said. The audience ended at 5-30 p.m. 18. Shortly after 6 Sheikh Yussuf called on me to break the news that the King wished to give us presents. I am dealing separately with this. 19. We dined with the King at 6 • 30. He was in the best of form before and during dinner; chaffed Mr. Philby over his unwillingness to adopt the Royal suggestion that he should take a wife; expounded his own views as to the excellence of matrimony up to the extreme limits allowed by the holy law; and spoke freely of the way in which he was served by the sons of his former enemies. He laughed at reports in the press that one of the Beni Rashid was raising the Shammer against him, when the person named and others of that family were with his sons at the front. All the sons of Dawish, he said, were also at the front. 20. TLe started on business again about 7-30. I broached the question of the King’s relations with Koweit, the adjustment of which was strongly desired by His Majesty’s Government with special reference to the desirability of ending the present restriction on trade between Koweit and Nejd. A proposal, I observed, had been made quite a long time ago to seek a basis of settlement, but it had been held up by the question of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, a matter which also required settlement. The King expressed eagerness for a settlement of the blockade question on a basis of reciprocity. I asked what he meant; whereupon he developed, not very clearly, various views as to the effect of different prices for commodities in Nejd and Koweit and of smuggling. He said that he could not agree to customs posts on the frontier, as they would cost more than they would produce in the way of revenue, and smuggling would still go on. I suggested that the conti ol exercised by his blockade officer, AI Bagawi, seemed to be pretty effective, and that Al Bagawi might be better employed in collectino- revenue than m stopping trade. The King was not impressed by this, but finally said that he would welcome a meeting of representatives of himself and the sheikh to devise a settlement. He did not revert to the question of the sheikh’s claims. I preferred not to carry the discussion further in view of the sheikh’s attitude since the meeting of commissioners was first proposed. 21. I asked the King generally how he wished our discussion to be followed up. 1 was not very clear, I said, as to the plans of Fuad Bey Hamza If Fuad Bey was coming to London and was authorised to express His Majesty’s views he would have an opportunity of doing so, while I was at home. Alternatively’ the ground might be prepared during my absence for the final handling of the questions on my return from leave. The King said that Fuad Bey was to spend a month in Paris and would be able to speak for him in London. He suggested that should leport our discussions at Taif and that any expression of His Maiesty’s Government s views should be conveyed to his Government, whereupon Fuad Bey would be instructed. I pointed out that this would take time and the King presently agreed to my counter-suggestion that Fuad Bey should be acouainted W v h n W p at n ia 1i )aSSed at 1 Ta \ f ’ and silould be instructed at once as to the line on which he should pursue the discussion in London. this point I said that, although there were other rmt«fsir»rP'nn* questions, I did not wish to trouble His Majesty personally with them and fproceeded to make a suitable little speech of farewell. After hearing it, the King said he had something further to speak about. His Majesty’s Government were worried about restrictions on trade with Koweit. AVhat of restrictions on trade with Nejd ? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrein m regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under impression that ££ the Government ” had prohibited such shipments. On my asking whether ne meant His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrein Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrein Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrein, by a ship which had tried to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrein and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Govern ment had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Has Tanura ? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Ras Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty’s Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegation, though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Maiesty’s Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrein and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time. 24. The chief interest of this discussion was the revelation it attordect or the King’s bitter personal resentment. He threw out references which I did not understand, to other countries like Japan, &amp;c., and their attitude towards simi ai problems. He clung to his grievance long after the latest hour at which he toM me he could say his prayers. It was well after 9 when I was able to leave him. 25 Shortly before 10, Sheikh Yussuf called again to deliver the Aiab clothes; which I had consented to receive At 4 a.m. next day he was on the spot once more to see me off. I delayed my departure a s 01 , , m !t rejno-’c nxietv about the Bahrein question. I said I had been impressed by the King s amxiety to treat the questioS of direct shipments as a separate issue I did n °t wmh Hm Majesty to think that I had been difficult the previous evening, and assured him % 0 6 m ^'he^foregoino' I1 accouiffi 0 of^im^ is accurate on all main points, but if no? an exact record of all that passed, asjegards the sequence of the individual discussions.

Mr. Philby, himself rather excited indignation, aoout uiube lwu xxxxxx^xx x«,uxicj excited, said that the King had expressed his firm determination not to give way TTo e»mntiaci capI tVip nnfnrtnup.tonoss of thp. mnmp{^' Lt? d O (Aj d vX L'd 1 tX L L/xJ-C X xX xxCv Vi- v^xv py x xa.

Right Honourable Sir John Simon, GCoI*, KGVO., etc., etc., etc.s l ANGLO- xliiijLu^TIQNB. After Fuad Bey haa given me the latest news of the Saudi Yemen situation on the 5th June, I commended the wisdom which the King has shewn, though, I c.ad 3 a, I could understand the feelings of people who, like Fuad Bey himself, woulu have liked to see Mm mop up the Yemen completely. Fuad Bey said that the turn which matters had taken was largely due to the amhiguousness of the British attitude. He admitted that the Saudi Government had no grounds of complaint hut they nad not had the support for which they might have hoped in view of their old relations with H.L.G. I said that H.IuG.'s attitude had heen clear so far as they themselves were concerned. Mien they said neutrality, they meant neutrality and that meant non intervention, whatever happened, His real trouble, I suggested, was that 1 nad heen guarded in respect to Italy and had dissuaded him from putting formal questions as to what H.Ivi.G. would do if Italy intervened. Although I had heaaed him off such Questioning, I had naturally reported our conversations and had in the end got a very short statement, viz., that H.k.G. could not enter into discussion on the oasis that reliance could not he placed on the assurances which Italy had given to the Saudi Government notably on the 12th lay. Fuad Bey mejYtionea the possibility of his going to Europe for reasons of health this summer ana perhaps visiting London. He went on to say that the King lelt tne time pad come to take stock of his relations with ri.M.G* He proceeded to sound me as to the possibility of some sort of discussion of a general kina and intimated that tne King himself might like to see uie either at Tail or in Jedaa I was friendly hut guarded regarding Fuad Bey’s suggested visit to London, presently he begged me to divorce this question/ 4 j 1 ^V 3 increasingly European in outlook. I said that what little I knew of King Ghazi gave me the impression that he was a very sensible young man. Fuad Bey said that Turkey ana Persia professed the greatest friendship for Saudi Arabia ana that tne Turks in particular had sympathised with Idn Saua &amp;s against the Imam, though the latter had supported them in the Great War. He nevertheless sounded very suspicious of their real attituae towards the Arabs. I agreed to continue the conversation the next day. /hen we resumed it yesterday morning I said that on trying to make a note of our discussion of the previous day, I had found myself uncertain as to whether I had quite got the hang of what Fuad Bey wanted to convey. We had adverted; I thought, to two distinct kinds of question, viz., (1) questions which formed, each separately, the subject of ordinary diplomatic discussion and (2) questions ol a wider nature to which Fuad Bey had referred. He had intimated the view that there was material for general conversations with H.k.G. on their relations with Saudi Arabia. It seemed to me, however, that, ii I had correctly indicated the questions he had in view ana tuere were no others, his proposal would creak down, as regards (i) on the reluctance of H.M.G. to treat such questions otherwise than on their separate merits, chough it was true that a good many important matters had come into prominence more or less simultaneously; and as regards (2) on the reluctance of H.M.G. to engage in discussion of a purely hypothetical nature. Fuad Bey aid not contest my analysis out rather disclaimed tne idea that he had made a proposal. He explained that he had wished rather to puC, on aenaif of tne King, a general question which, as elucidated oy me, boils/think; thcit tlie time had toils aown to this:- Dici come for a rap'prochement with this country with a view to the establishment of closer relations ana a coordination 0 f general policy in their mutual interest; and if so, might not conversations he undertaken with a view to some sort of an understanding agreeable to both, whether a gentleman*s agreement, a written document or an alliance? He suggested that, if said No, that would close the matter as Ibn Baud could not force himself on them, but Fuad Bey was clearly very keen that they should say, Yes. I said that I would convey this question but that I could foresee the answer. I still thought that H.m.G. would see no necessity for conversations of aio kiriu. suggested ana might doubt their desirability. I repeated that, in my opinion, the Saudi Government were exaggerating, if they saw danger to this country or to the Axao world in the situation in neighbouring countries. He had spoken in general terms about the Yemen but there the settlement now in sight promised stability. Fuad Bey here caught on to some word I used to say that the treaty with the Yemen was going eo estaolish not a de facto situation but a frontier which could not be questioned in the future. I said, all the oerter, tne moie definite the frontier, the greater tne staoilizaoion, I had expressed to Sheykh Yusuf Yasin tne nope that tne frontier would be clea'r and definite. Fuad ney said 'that the treaty defined it clearly except at the eastern end, where the Saudi Government had wished to carry it on to the extremity of the nadhramaut• fne Yemenis, however, wishing, according to Fuad Bey, to preserve an uicimate claim to the Hadhramaut intact, had refused to agree to any mention of it whatsoever and no boundary naa o^en laid down east of Najran. 1/I again urged that the fears entertained hy the Saudi Government in regard to the aspiration they attributed to the Persian and Turkish Governments were exaggerated. I said that I had ransacker my memory though 1 had not had time to consult papers. I could only recall inaications of friction between rersia ana * Iraq and, I understood^ the abandonment of a visit which the Shah had thought of paying to Baghdad, but this fell a long way short of anything that could be thought to menace Saudi Arabia or the Arab brethren in * Iraq. I restated what I had said about Turkey the day before. She might nope for the Alexandretta region. She had questions with ’Iraq, but, so far as I know, they related to local matters in the Kurdish regions. She hact, in my opinion, no desire to retrieve an nrab empire. Fuad Bey intimated that what he had in mind was some midale term between the extremes I had indicated but he was unwilling to define it. He hinted that his Government coula produce proof of dangerous Turkish aspirations but took the line that anything more precise than what he had ^ said should be reserved for the proposed conversations. He ’was even more non-committal when I observed that his references to King Ghazi on the previous day were quite vague. I went on to discuss certain aspects of a possible visit by myself to Taif, as regards costume, reuention of diplomatic privileges, ana so forth. This led to a general conversation on the subject of access to -^aif, much of which is not worth recording. Fuad Bey assured me that, if I were invited to Taif, I should not oe let in for anything disagreeable to me that he admitted hi at diplomats as such were not allowed in the interior and sai^ ns nad explained the situation to Doth the luikish i^pi^oentative and the Soviet Minister, both of who® have recently expressed their intention of going to fair with tneir families/families. He made the amusing admission that, while the Saudi Government had been discouraging in the case of the Turkish representative, they had agreed to the Soviet Minister's visit, on the ground that there were certain Russians there who had drought some sort of an outfit (I think wireless, or automatic telephone apparatus for exhibition) and that, as they could not speak Arabic Monsieur Touraculov was to interpret for them. I tola Fuad Bey roundly that, while the Saudi Government might nave the right to deny access to places in their territory to Foreign representative^ they were unique in denying them access to all parts of it except the surround of Jedda. I went further and said that in my opinion it was contrary to international lav/, when representatives ware allowed exceptionally to go to places like Taif, to attempt to deprive them of their diplomatic character. Fuad Bey said in this part of trie conversation that the question of my visiting Taif had not been raised with the King. The general impression I derived from trie whole conversation was that he was making the mobt of general instructions. I think the position is la) that the King is in one of his periodical states of nervous suspicion as to how he stands vis-a-vis of H.m.G. and anxious to make a fresh bid for positive British support, and (^ j Hia^ a.uao ^q/ whose shares with the King may oe rather down at uxie but whose utility is recognised, is anxious to play an important personal rhle relying on his intimacy ^itn me an'' knowledge of the London milieu. He has spoken to Mi.Philoy definitely of his intention to visit London, but, as already recorded, he hedged on this subject with me on the 5th June, and he made no further mention of it yest^ruay.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received May 30.) (No. 135.) gir ? Jedda, May 8, 1934. WITH reference to your printed despatch No. 290 of the 26th October, I have the honour to state that on the 30th April the Acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs broached with me the question of the future of the Treaty of Jedda. Fuad Bey said that his Government had been considering the matter in view of the fact that the time when notice of denunciation might be given had passed. I reminded him that the effect of article 8 of the treaty was that it could be denounced at six months’ notice on any date after the 17th March, 1934, not to prolong it for any definite period if it were not denounced. I intimated early in the conversation that, from a British point of view, the treaty had many defects, but that it had served its purpose and that His Majesty’s Government were unlikely to wish to denounce it, although they would have several points to raise if a revision were necessitated by a Saudi denunciation. 2. Fuad Bey said that the Saudi Government did not wish to denounce the treaty but had considered three points connected with it, on which they might expect His Majesty’s Government to meet them. The first was the final settle ment of the Aqaba-Maan question. They did not, he said, think the present an appropriate time to reopen this. The second was the question oi slaveiy. As I shall be reporting separately on this, I need only say here that Fuad Bey ou this occasion seemed less disposed to press for the elimination of aiticle 7 oi the treaty, which could obviously not be removed without changing the structure ot the treaty, than for the termination of the manumission system. 3. When I reminded Fuad Bey that he had spoken of a third point, he hedged and left me in uncertainty as to whether he had been treating article 7 and manumission as two distinct points. On the 2nd May however when we were discussing my note of the 28th April, regarding the effect of the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, he admitted with some coyness that the third point, which he had refrained from mentioning on the 30th April, related to article 6 of the treaty. He was most anxious to assure me that Ibn baud Had no desire to interfere with His Majesty’s Government s special position m regard to the rulers mentioned in that article.

The Saudi reply and the Minister’s comments on it are contained in Jedda telegrams of 22nd June, 147 and 149, on P.Z. 4250/34. It will be seen that the Saudi Government continue to maintain their attitude that the Blue Line is not binding upon them,* but that Fuad Hamza in the course of his discussions referred to the possibility of a modification of the Blue Line which would move it east to a line the northern point of which would be Kara Ana in the Qatar peninsula. This would not be acceptable from our point of view*. Kara Aha is m the first place well within the boundaries which we have always recognised in the past for the Sheikh of Qatar. Secondly the Mr Ministry regard it as important to secure it if they are to give the protection to the Sheikh which we have guaranteed to him in the event of his meeting us over the grant of an oil concession. 3 Papers are Delius suDmiMea separately regarding certain overtures recently maOe Dy Puad Hanna to H.M.

In the light of our discussion of these telegrams a few days ago I talked the matter over yesterday with Mr. Warner. 2 ,. I said that we did not appear to have been consulted before the Foreign Office telegram of 19th June had been despatched; that the Foreign Office were, of course, the best judges of the difficulties in pursuing a particular course of action with Bin Saud, but that on the face of it we were inclined to think that their reply was possibly unduly cold and that there might be certain advantage in a friendly understanding with Bin Saud of a general nature if this could be reached. 3 . Mr* Warner said that the Foreign Office had had no desire to throw cold water on the Saudi approach. Their telegram was meant to indicate that there could oe no question of an alliance , but did not in any way rule out the possibility of a friendly general understanding. The objections to an alliance were that it was extremely rare for h.M.G. to contract an alliance (they had, it was true, done so with Iraq, but the precedent was not perhaps a very fortunate one). Secondly, in the Middle Eastern area they were already committed to a degree of support of Iraq and of Transjordan, while they had recently concluded a Treaty of Friendship with the Imam. The interests of Ibn saud, Transjordan and Iraq were not the same and there might be some danger of embarrassment if we had an alliance with both parties in view of the possibility of a conflict.ft? &amp;£% Jl- tS wf QyvAA-J C ^SO &lt;X Sou.^&gt; &lt;»L&lt;nz,lr Jt Klwuz. S^KX_ Va4x ^ c^v •V» 'Z' WtA— . 4. As regards a friendly understanding, the Foreign Office approached Fuad’s statements with some little diffidence because of the present uncertainty as to his precise position vis-a-vis the King, and the extent to which he might not he endeavouring to consolidate his own position by persuading us on his own initiative to make some move which the King would welcome. But the instructions which had been sent to sir A. Hyan would, if there was anything behind Fuad’s approach, make it possible to take matters further and see precisely what the SaudiQ had in mind. The matter could be considered further when we had their reply. 5 . we shall, I gather, be kept in touch with any developments. Prlma facie , there seems a good deal to be said for a friendly general understanding, though one difficulty will be that we have certain positive desiderata, such as the raising of the Koweit blockade, 1 i ‘■l the satisfactory settlement of the Blue Line dispute, and possibly such relatively minor questions as Bahrein transit dues, on which we should expect Ibn Baud to meet us as part of such an arrangement, On the other hand, there is very little, if anything, which we could give beyond rather general assurances of friendship ana sympathy. A financial grant is out of the question: we have already rejected Saudi overtures for a loan. We could no doubt assist by providing instructors, or possibly (as you suggested yesterday) by supplying war material at reduced iates. But even here we could operate only witnin very narrow limits and it is questionable, if that assumption is correct, to what extent we could really give the King any very adeQuate Quid pro quo. it might be •possible/possible to meet him In some way over the Neutral zone concession, hut that too is still very much in the air at the moment. Much, however, must depend on what exactly he has in mind, II he is indeed behind the i overtures made hy Fuad, and it is perhaps unprofitable to speculate in any detail at this stage. lultTCviu. t/T~ f~- vU .?4. Since the above was written Mr. Warner tells me that he has been considering the matter further. I suggested to him yesterday that there was a close connection between any entente with the Saudis and their note about the Blue Line on P.Z.4250. he now tells me that he Is inclined to think that it might he well to send instructions to Sir A* Ryan as to the line to be taken by him in the event of the approaches made by Fuad being followed by the King and of its proving necessary for H.M. Minister to discuss the matter with Ibn Saud. Sir A. Ryan is, it appears, leaving in about 10 days’ time. The line which Mr. Warner suggests is that in the event of the King raising the question and suggesting the desirability of some general friendly understanding Sir A. Ryan should reply sympathetically ana say that wtTof course, very well disposed towards the King, and that we should be quite prepared to reaffirm our friend ship, but that the King would of course appreciate that friendship was not compatible with the existence of points of difference between the two Governments; that there were unluckily two outstanding points at the moment which it would/would de necessary to dispose of. In the case of the Koweit blockade the King was applying pressure which we regarded as quite improper and unjustifiable to one of our clients. 3h the case of the Blue Line he was asking us, without any justification, to disregard a treaty settlement which was entirely binding legally and internationally. Sir A. Ryan might proceed that he was now returning home and would lay the King’s remarks before Sir John Simon and The two particular points to which he had referred and the question generally might form the subject of discussion on his return. Meanwhile he was in a position to give^the King a general assurance that our attitude toward© him was friendly, but it would of course be understood that there must be no encroachment to the east of the Blue Line pending the results of any discussions which might take place and consequent on vhich details or some minor adjustments might be considered. On the lAhole, I think there is something to be said for tills/ It is desirable from our standpoint to postpone discussion as long as possible in the interests of allowing the ^.tar oil negotiations to progress. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly clear that we may have to come out into the open and offer discussion, before the end of the year at any rate, in view of the terns of the latest Saudi Note. Sir A- Ryan win not return till November and it will probably be some months after that before any outcome of general discussions between us can be hoped for. In the meantime considerable progress might well be made at Qatar. We may be asked at short notice to concur m instructions/instructions on the a.Dove lines if they comniend. themselves to higher authority in the Foreign Office, and I therefore venture to hother you with the papers at once.

A 17 Correspondence ending with your telegrams Nos,50 and 8 Fuad engaged me in long conversations on June 5th and 6th regarding general relations between Itn Baud and His majesty* s Government. Anile admitting that the former had no ground for complaint he attributed recent compromise with the Imam to mis amDiguou-neoS of Kis Majesty’s Government’s attitude. I contested this on obvious lines, Fuad said that the King felt that the time had come to take stock of his relations with His majesty s Government and sounded me as to tne possibility of their consenting to a general discussion in preparation for which the King might like to see me himseli. I admitted several maj,or questions had assumed or were assuming importance but I reminded nim o± constant preference of His Majesty’s Government for dealing with all such questions on their individual merits and expressed doubt as to whetner lou vould uee I material there was for a general discussion. Fuad said that events in the neighbouring countries made Ibn Baud anxious to consider his position.

My re-action was friendly but guarded whereupon he begged me to divorce question of Ms visiting London from that raised by. the King.

That reply should I give? in particular would you be prepared to give Fuad a hearing if he went to London? In my opinion visit to England could produce no more result than that of the Saudi Mission in 1932 and it would doubtless be in many ways inconvenient. On the other hand iu&amp;d intends to go to Europe for reasons of health in any case and could hardly be prevented from going to London privately.

OLIPHANT said that he was now in a position to reply, one by one, to the points raised by Fuad Bey Hamza at the previous meeting; he hoped that Fuad Bey would thereafter ask for any elucidation which he might desire. I. He wished to confirm the assurance which he had given to the delegation at the last meeting, that His Majesty’s Government desired, as in the past, the most cordial and friendly relations with the Hejazi Government. II. As regards a loan by His Majesty’s Government/it was quite out of the question for them to meet the wishes of the Hejazi Government in the matter. But arrangements had been made since the last meeting that luad Bey Hamza should be received at the Bank of England, where he would be given explanations as to the present financial situation in the city and could discuss the possibility of a public loan or one by some reputable financial house. But in saying this he did not desire to raise any false hopes. He had also spoken to the chairman oi the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the chief manager of the bank, Mr. Lldred, would be happy to see Fuad Bey and to explain to him the preliminaries necessary before the flotation of a loan. But as the present time was most unprop!tious for any financial ventures, Mr. Eldred would discuss the possibii y o e mp ^ Bank of Persia acting- as London correspondents ot the Hejazi Government should this be desired. Sir L. Oliphant had also consulted f.^f^nv 1 chance Treasury, who had confirmed his conviction that there was httle if any, cha of a loan for the Hejazi Government being entertained m the City at the present ‘’“hll As regards the Haramein Wakfs, the India Office had telegraphed to the Government of India, with special reference to the . b ^® stS r ^ed h had died in Java, the case to which FuadBey Hamza had spemfieal v d t The Colonial Office had also consulted the Government of Palestine about tne Palestine \Vakfs, raised by Fuad Bey Hamza but 'd Sd an received was not clear.

Fuad Bey Hamza .said th . at A^Hif^ thanks for the assurances given by His Lviajesi&gt; communicate them to King Abdul Aziz. [462 n—1]It was a great personal grief and disappointment to him that His Majesty’s Government could not see their way to assist the Hejazi Government with a loan. tt:„ min-Ut nnw havp no alternative, but to look elsewhere for heir&gt;. false impression. Sir L. Olifhant here interrupted him to assure him that it was a matter of great regret to His Majesty’s Government also, and that it was of course natural that the fojazi Government should try to raise a loan elsewhere; and that His Majesty’s Government would not for a moment misunderstand such action. Fuad Bey Hamza continued that in connexion with Transjordan, the Hejazi Government would wait to hear further from His Majesty’s Government. The proposal for the conclusion of agreements had been made in the interests of the two countries and not from any personal motives. As regards the Soviet, he thought it unlikely that there would be any important change in the attitude of his Government. At Mr. Renders suggestion, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned the proposal which he had raised before the meeting that His Majesty’s Government should reconsider their decision as regards the despatch of a Royal Air Force training mission to the Hejaz and Nejd; but this was to be regarded as a personal suggestion of his •own. He was assured that the matter would be examined. The meeting was then concluded.

OLIPHANT asked Fuad Bey Hamza to mention any questions which the delegation wished to discuss. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that King Abdul Aziz had instructed them to raise the following points: — The main purpose of the mission was to ascertain whether His Majesty s 3oyernment still felt for the Hejaz-Nejd Government the same g°dwdl as m hP nast and still desired the maintenance of close relations ot l tr ]® nclbI LP* KfnPAbdul Aziz had been anxious for some time past as to whether His h ' ^ XI .—Economic Questions.

They were also to enquire, as King Abdul Aziz had enquired in the past, what policy His Majesty’s Government would advise him to follow m regard to Soviet activities. ,. 1,1 . . x Fuad Bey Hamza said that these were the points which the mission were ) instructed to take up with His Majesty’s Government. The one of fundamental importance was the first. If the reply on that point was encouraging, the others could be dealt with in turn. ; S ^ e 0^ /iHli Ce Sir L. Oliphant then replied on each of these five points in turn. As to I, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Hejaz-Nejd, he said he had always been puzzled when, from time to time, it was reported that King Abdul Aziz felt doubts as to the continuance of the friendly attitude of His Majesty’s Government. He assured Fuad Bey Hamza emphatically that in fundamentals that attitude was as cordial as ever. He stiessed the phra,se “in fundamentals.” With the extension of the dominions of King Abdul Aziz, the points of contact with His Majesty's Government had increased in number. Since the war, His Majesty’s Government had certain connexions with terri tories which were adjacent to those dominions and which formerly had been part of the Turkish Empire. Sir Lancelot emphasised that these were not colonies, but mandated territories, and that this distinction connoted a real difierence of relationship, and a real difference in the degree of control exercised by His Majesty’s Government. With the more numerous points of contact, occasions of’ differences between His Majesty’s Government and the Hejaz-Nejd Government had naturally arisen. King Abdul Aziz, before now, had explained that, when he spoke frankly, it was because it was appropriate to do so between friends. His Majesty’s Government agreed with this sentiment, and when causes of difficulty arose, they, too, believed in speaking frankly, as the best means of clearing up differences between friends. His Majesty must, therefore, not misunderstand them when they did so, or think that this showed a change of fundamental attitude. As he said before, he could give an absolute assurance that, fundamentally, His Majesty’s Government’s attitude remained one of sincere friendship. Sir Lancelot added that, if Luad Bey, when he returned to his country, would explain this to His Majesty, and remove any misapprehensions which he might have on this subject, the mission’s visit to this country would have been well worth while. Fuad Bey Hamza expressed his pleasure at Sir L. Oliphant’s statement, and he said he would do his best on his return to the Hejaz to eradicate from King Abdul Aziz’s mind any mistaken ideas that might remain on this subject. Passing to II, the mission’s request for a loan, Sir L. Oliphant explained the difficulties in this time of most stringent economy. He would not mislead Fuad Bey into thinking it was at all likely that the mission’s request could be acceded to. He would, however, put the point to the Treasury and would give an answer soon, so that the mission might, if they wished, approach financial houses, although he feared that from that quarter, too, the chances of getting a loan were remote. I uad Bey Hamza said that, if His Majesty’s Government could not themselves make a loan to his Government, they could, perhaps, arrange one with some financial houses. His Government only required a loan of £500,000. In answer to a question, he explained that he meant £500,000 gold, or its equivalent, and that he had data as to what could be offered as security. Sir L. Oliphant said that, while he could not encourage any hope in Fuad Bey, he would consult the competent department. In regard to III, Haramein Wakfs, Sir L. Oliphant recalled that King Abdul Aziz had made a similar request some years ago, and His Majesty’s Government had given a written reply. The Government of India could not interfere in religious and quasi-religious matters, and there were no religious courts in India; but His Majesty’s Government had explained that, if the Hejaz- Nejd Government wished, they could have recourse to the civil courts, and had (iii)A ^tley woul( km of 1 In res idisguiiexpressed readiness to consider sympathetically any request for assistance or advice. Fuad Bey Hamza said that there were Wakfs administered by Government departments in British-controlled territory, e.q.— (i) There were Wakfs in Palestine, administered by the Supreme Moslem Council. . , . (ii) Certain moneys, sent by the Nizam of Hyderabad, were distributed m theHejaz. Puad Bey seemed to think that these might be the proceeds of Wakfs. . j • j • T (iii) A certain Ali Surraty (? Surati), probably an Indian died m Java, leaving properties in Rangoon, the proceeds of one-third qt wnicn were to be devoted to the poor in Medina and Mecca. The Hejaz-Mejd Government had applied to the authorities in Java, who replied that they could do nothing in respect of the properties m Burma, and that application should be made to the Administrator-General of Irus s there. Nothing had been received by the Hejaz-Nejd Government. Fuad Bey also said that his Government might wish to send a delegation to India to make enquiries. Sir L. Oliphant said that he would cause enquiries to be made regarding these specific cases which Fuad Bey had mentione , an assistance as might be possible would be readily given by the India Oft ^ they would probably be ready to advise the Hejaz-Nejd Government choice of legal representatives if required.

Discussions with the Hejaz-Nejd Mission. First Meeting. THE first meeting with the Hejaz-Nejd Mission was held in the Foreign Office at 12-15 p.m. on the 9th May. ^ Present : Sir L. Oliphant (in the Chair). The Emir Feisal. The Hejaz Minister, Fuad Bey Hamza. M. Zada (Secretary of the Legation). Mr. G. W. Rendel. Mr. C. F. A. Warner. The business was of a formal nature. Sir L. Oliphant, after a complimentary reference to the presence of the mission in this country, and to the good relations existing between the two Governments, said that he wa^ at the disposal of the mission for the discussion of any questions which they might wish to raise, and suggested that it might be convenient that a meeting should be held in the afternoon for this purpose. The Emir Feisal, after expressing pleasure at the friendship which bound the two countries, agreed to Sir L. Oliphant’s proposal, and it was arranged that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Fuad Bey Hamza should come to the Foreign Office for a further meeting at 4 o’clock. Sir L. Oliphant said that the Emir would have learnt already from His Majesty the King, and from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that it was their desire that the most cordial relations should be maintained. The Emir Feisal expressed the pleasure with which he had heard these sentiments from His Majesty and Sir John Simon, and said that his father set great store by the maintenance of such good relations. Sir L. Oliphant enquired whether there was any question which the Emir Feisal wished to discuss. The Emir replied that he had already alluded to the one question of fundamental importance. It was their desire that there should be between the two countries a true friendship, not merely an official one. He was much gratified by the assurances he had received on this point. He did not himself wish to raise any other questions, and would leave the discussion of any other points to Fuad Bey Hamza. Foreign Office, May 9, 1932.

At my last interview when I went to say goodbye to him just before I left Ibn Saud asked me to transmit a message from him to His Majesty's Government, and after he had delivered it verbally I suggested that Yusuf Yasin should write it down: His Majesty therefore uictated it to him, and freely translated it runs as follows. fI I wish you to give my greetings to the British Government and say co them that I speak to them with the word of a Muslim Arab. 'Firstly, that I do not desire or seek greater friendship from anyone else in all the world, either from among the Europeans or the Muslim powers, than that which I have with the British Government, and it is cuite impossible that X should oppose them in any matter. Secondly, I desire peace and friendship with the whole world but specially with those of my neighbours and others who are in relations with the British Government, and whoever says to the contrary is in error, or a liar, or has misunderstood nnd I ash of them that if any one says such a thing of me, that they should refer the matter to me and let me hnow what mistake I am supposed to have committed; but on the condition that the reference should be maue through an intelligent man who can grasp the actual facts anu will not misconstrue them. u The Arabic is in one or' two places a little ambiguous, doubtlessdoubtless due to the fact that the Xing took no trouble to choose his words but dictated it straight away. I therefore enclose a copy of the message in Arabic as well.‘ I NO' Minute Paper.

The first is a memo, from the Hejaz Legation, containing a number of unjustified accusations against Sir A. Ryan and virtually asking for his recall. The origin of this outburst is, of course, the case of the slave who 7 m J was protected by H.M. Legation at the end of January last, and embarked on board H.M.S. ,, Penzance ,, . Mr. Baxter explained that this paper had not been circulated to other Departments before now because the F.O. felt that it would be desirable to wait until they were in a position to circulate a draft reply at the same time. The draft,&lt; which was submitted to Sir John Simon, could not be dealt with by him until recently owing to his preoccupations at Geneva, etc. He / has now ^approved the dra ~ and it is intended that^Lfc^ould be handed to the Hejazi Minister in London, Hafi^ahba, on Monday or Tuesday next. The reply, of course, takes a strong line, completely exculpating Sir a. Ryan (who m the incident of the slave was acting under the moso detailed instructions from London), and ends by stating that if the Hejazi Note is not withdrawn, H.M.G. will cease to be represented by a Minister at Jeddah. Although it is desirable to maintain friendly relations with Ibn Saud, it will no doubt be agreed that no other course than that taken in the F.O. Note is possible after reception of the Hejazi memo./memo, to which it refers. The complaints against Sir A. Ryan being completely frivolous so far as he personally i concerned, and the complaint regarding the slave being really an objection against fhe policy of it is impossible to submit to such treatment of a British Minister, and the only line to take with an Oriental govt, is to be completely firm in the matter. Mr. Baxter says that Hafi7^ahba,who is enlightened and friendly, will do his utmost to smooth the matter over and secure withdrawal of the Hejazi memo. If, however, we should be compelled to put an end to our representation at Jeddah by a Minister, British interests would be looked after^by a charge d’affaires, who would be able to deal with such urgent matters as our interests in the Pilgrimage&gt; 'JU Fo So ^ ^ ^4- fit f* fitly “7 / //&gt;, ? /w&lt;-'v ) fORSLGH 0WIC:&lt;, s. w. i.

He states that the use of such language would have Sheikh Hafis I&amp;hba, been entirely inconsistent/ Minister of the Hej&amp;z.inconsistent with the attitude of ceferenoe nhioi. he has always observe^ even when Ciscusaing with His Majesty the most difficult questions. (Z\ Sir 4. -iyan points out that when he discussed the i'rana-Jordan frontier question with the King on March 2nd of last year, under the instructions of the then Secretary of State, he referred to the belief entertained on both aides o' the frontier that raids from Heiaa-Mejd were countenanced by His Majesty. He cited this as an indication of the gravity of the situation but stated expressly that he was not associating his Government or himself with the suggestion current on the frontier regarding the King’s attitude (3) Sir 4. lynn admits that in s conversation with fmd Bey Hama on January 2 last, he expressed satis faction at the presence of a witness in the person of Mr. Hops Sill. He uia so because Fuad Bey had ueotionad the propriety of his action in giving asylum in the Legation to a so-called slave named Harun, a British subject, and ^ had afterwards denied having tasen up so indefensible a ^ position. Sir 4. dysn assures me that he at no tice accused the He jar, i Government of falsifying statements by the lai$ Bit Gilbert Cl&amp;ytOB* (4) The last accusation against dir 4. dy&amp;n has reference to his action in the case of the ex-slave Bakhit. ! He observes that he had from the outset of his conversations on this subject made it clear to Fuad Bey Bam** that, if the Hejasi Government could not see their way «.o * rt the manumission and repatriation of Bakhit, his only alterant ive/alternative would be to refer the a&amp;tter for my instructions; stud that his eventual action, after he had made every effort to settle the matter amicably, was determined by the instructions which ha received from me in due course. 4. Further, I desire to place on record that Sir A, dyan on that occasion did not take any action in the matter except on direct personal instructions which 1 myself addressed to him and for which I take full responsibility. 5. I accept these explanations by Sir ; . dyan the more readily as they are in complete accordance with the reports which he addressed at the time to Mr. Henderson and myself on all these matters, whenever the conversations appeared to him to be oi sufficient importance to be recorded. 1 must consider as unsub stantiated the more general accusation that he has sought to impair the relations between the two Governments and the even more injurious suggestion that he has made it his object to stir up trouble in the city of Jedaa. 6. In these circumstances, 1 feel 9ur8 ? our Government will recognise the propriety of withdrawing the note in question, which has evidently been written under a misapprehension. indeeo 1 muj add that i earnestly trust that this friendly step will be taken, for were this not the case. 1 should most regretfully be com pall eel/compelled to add that* while Sir A. ayan would not resume his duties as His Majesty 1 8 Minister at Jedda* it would not he possible for His Majesty 1 © Government to replace him by any other Minister of His Majesty 1 s Service. 1 have the honour to he, with the highest consideration.

In his conversation with His Majesty a few days after presenting his letter of Credit Sir Andrew accused His Majesty in the presence of some of his ministers that he was living in a world of fantasy and imagination and in his conversation with His Kajesty in March last in connexion with the situation on the frontier of Transjordania he accused His Majesty of personally disturbing the peace on the frontier and encouraging raids and unrest and in his conversation with the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs about the question of slavery said that jhe thanked Cod that Mr. Hope Gill was present with him at the meeting in order to witness what was said as he ieared that in event of his death we might falsify somethings he never said and attribute them to him as we have already falsii led statements?mcl ofttri'bu.'trfio t*o tii 6 Ifit© Ocn©rsX Clsyton* His Majesty King A'bdul Aziz and his Government have 'been trying to overlook all such oi fences and reef rain themselvt s from giving offence in return out of their consideration for the British Government but it is now no longer possible to tolerate this treatment any more. fir Andrew did not serve the cause of good relations but on the contrary he made the good relations between the two sides become estranged and we are now in doubt as to the real position ana whether he is doing all this on his own or with the consent of his Government* The last act of offence from Sir Andrew occurred in connexion with the case of a slave of Hie Majesty’s who took refug* in the British Legation. The Mnistry of Foreign Affairs informed Sir Andrew that the slave belonged to His Majesty and in accordance with the agreement between His Majesty and the British Government should not ue detained Out Sir Andrew took no notice of this, trod over the dignity of the King and insulted the local authorities and humiliated the Government publicly by calling H.M.S.Bizance ana causing the slave to be taken aboard, thus injuring the dignity of the Government and flouting its authority. Ae a matter of fact had it not been for the Foyal Commands , _ *■ v»ct. not to usc force received at the last moment to the el • . _ vinrard of the slave a grave m preventing the conveying on boar , f -a f y* am Sir Andrew* s extreme incident might have resulted from action, the results of which it is i^sible to foretell. j, tfiat Mr »«.. »,.» * 0 bring about troubl. in «« •*« « 10 0 ''“ I “ attainattain the object he desires, in other words to bring \ about difficult contentions between the two Governments. His Majesty’s Government protests against Sir Andrew Ryan’s behaviour, which is lowering to its dignity and considers that his continuing to act as a medium between His Majesty’s Government and the British Government cannot produce except an aggravation of disputes between the two sides, which in any case is neither pleasing to His Majesty King Abdul-Axtas nor to the British Government as it is not to their interests to be so involved. His Majesty’s Government awaits a quick and decisive reply in order that the difference may not grow any bigger and the two Governments become involved in unnecessary disputes on account of ;ir Andrew.Notes.

Shsylth Abdullah is about 35 years old and a son of ths late Ibrahim al Eadhl, head of the erstwhile considerable Hejazi firm of 'E.A.Alfazel' of Bombay. The firm has recently gone into a bankruptoy which some consider fraudulent and Sheylch Abdullah, as one of the directors, has retired from before its creditors to the He^, where he has since been living on the King's charity. He understands English but speaks it badly. As far as 1 can discover his only previous contacts with Europe and diplomacy were made in 1926, when he accompanied the young Amir Fey sal, as his private secretary, to England, Holland and |* r ^ ^ QQ, j His Majesty’s Principal Secretary oi State for Foreign Affairs.France 4.

On tim occasion there was no delegation of the Egyptian press, but there was a sufficiency of journalists to provide for publicity'and innumerable photographs were taken by all sorts of people. The most active press representative present was one Malm Bey, an Arab of Mosul origin, who seems to have his headquarters at Ihe Mague at present and whose main line appears to be the supply of European news to the papers of the Arab countries. 2. I had received your permission to attend the banquet, which I understood would be given by the Emir Feisal in Jedda on the evening of the 8th January, if 1 considered it politically desirable to be present, notwithstanding the mourning ordered by His Majesty the King for the Princess Royal. I learnt later that there were to be four principal functions to which foreign representatives were invited. As the head of the only mission of first-class political importance here, I felt that any abstention on my part would be seriously misinterpreted in Jedda and Mecca, especially as I had had no previous opportunity of meeting the Emir Feisal, who now combines the functions of Minister for Foreign Affairs with those of Viceroy of the Hejaz. I therefore accepted the various invitations. One of the social functions projected, a tea-party at Kandara on the afternoon of the 8th, was in the event countermanded. Although no express reason was given, I was told privately by Fuad Bey Hamza that this change in the programme was intended as a mark of respect to the memory of the Princess Royal. I felt it all the more incumbent on me to attend the other functions. In my private letter thanking Fuad Bey and expressing satisfaction, I added that the gesture of the local authorities would be greatly appreciated in England, and explained that I was interrupting a period of mourning for an event deeply felt at home in order to be present at the various celebrations. 3. On the morning of the 8th January, my colleagues and I called on the Acting Governor of Jedda. Early in the afternoon the Emir Feisal gave me a special interview, which had been arranged by Fuad Bey. His Royal Highness was very civil and very nervous. I cannot say that my first impression of him was favourable. He has the fine features of his family and he does not show in his face the signs of dissipation which I expected. He lacks, however, both the charm and the physique of his father and his elder brother, the Emir Sand. In repose he wears a look of jaded melancholy and listlessness, and his smiles, though agreeable, are sickly. In my own slight intercourse with him on the 8th and 9th January, he gave little evidence of keenness or intelligence, though I noticed that with his own entourage he seemed confident and quick in decision. Ihe inter preter whom he employed at my private interview .was incapable. I had nor intended to talk much business on such an occasion and, owing to the difficulty of getting anything of importance translated, I limited myself still further. I enquired as to whether my letters to Fuad Hamza and the King in connexion with the proposed visit of Colonel Biscoe had been forwarded to Riadh and when they might be expected to arrive. The Prince said that he had forwarded the letters, but his reply to my second question was hopelessly vague. My only other attempt at business was to appeal to the Prince on behalf of two prisoners, oae a British Indian, who has been detained too long on a doubtful charge, the other, a Hadrami, who may be guilty of a serious offence, but who appeal s to have been barbarously treated. I envoked the custom of using clemency on royal anniversaries and the Prince promised to look into the two cases. 4. The review held by the Emir Feisal at Kandara on the afternoon of the 8th Januarv presented features of interest. King Ibn Saud not long ago appointed a certain Nabi Bey el-Adhma to be Director of Military Organisation. [34 b—2]This gentleman resigned after a very short time and was replaced by one Faudhi Bey al-Kawokii, a Syrian officer, who formerly served m the Turkish army and took part, apparently with some distinction, in the Palestinian campaign He would appear to have been German trained, judging by his excellent knowledge of German. During the last Syrian revolt he went over to the rebels and came to this country as a fugitive from the French. The review afforded an opportunity for displaying the meagre results so far achieved m the direction of creating a regular army The march past was headed by two detachments of infantry, about 500 men in all, rather ragged in formation but workmanlike and to some extent disciplined Then followed a string of pack animals with various equip ment and about 100 men in charge. Then came two armoured cars, which were followed by the 'cavalry,” consisting of less than forty horsemen, ill-mounted and variously equipped, nothing more, in fact, than a disorderly lout of tribesmen, who indulged in wild shouts as'they passed. The camelry, who came after them, were distinctly more impressive and numbered at least 320, perhaps more. This force, though also wild and composed of heterogeneous types, had a certain air of efficiency. Towards the end of the review three aeroplanes of the Hejaz Air Force swept round in great circles, while the cavalry again appeared to display their prowess in galloping, firing comic pistols and emitting war cries. The aeroplanes did not venture to come low for fear of stampeding the camels. It had been intended that they should approach when the camelry went back to barracks, but the arrangements for this miscarried and as no signalling had been arranged the aerial display was rather tame. 5. The first day ended with a dinner of about 120 covers at Kandara. The Emir, who was to have presided, excused himself at the last moment on grounds of slight indisposition. Otherwise, the arrangements were excellent. Only two speeches were allowed. The first and more important consisted of a lengthy review of Ibn Sand’s efforts in various directions. International relations were touched on and reference was made to the rapprochement with Iraq resulting from the meeting of the two Kings on board H.M.S. ' Lupin.” It was remarked that no mention was made of Egypt, an omission the more striking as it is understood that recent negotiations, though their scope and prospects of success have been exaggerated, have afforded promise of a better understanding between Egypt and the Hejaz. The Soviet Minister said a few words in Arabic at the end of dinner in reply to the references which had been made to the diplomatic representatives. 6. Mr. Hope-Gill and I started early on the 10th January for Wady Fatma to attend the celebration organised there by the municipality of Mecca. The programme was a heavy one. There were some twenty-four speeches, poems and set pieces recited by schoolboys, before and after luncheon. The Emir Feisal presided with hardly concealed boredom, though he was himself the object of the most eloquent eulogies. He was at his best with some children of the Royal family, including his own son, who flitted in and out of the reception tent. One of the items was a set piece welcoming the Prince and the foreign representatives, delivered in English by a Mecca schoolboy. His nervousness contrasted strongly with the aplomb of his comrades, who produced their Arabic effusions from lungs of bronze, and he boggled sadly, poor child, over the hard Avord ' representatives.' ' Another interesting school item was a case heard before the Cadi between advocates of pen and sword. The sword was very large and the pen very little. The Cadi, in a nicely-balanced judgment, declared them both to be servants, of equal utility as such, and reconciled the advocates in a handshake. One poet gi acefully compared the Emir and the diplomatic representatives to the moon surrounded by stars. His comparison was apter than he knew, for our Minister toi I oreign Affairs is a great but pallid and elusive luminary and we, the stars, are very fixed in Jedda. The proceedings were punctuated by choral Performances. . Singing does not appear to rank as forbidden music, and one of me chants was introduced as the ' Song of the Fatherland.” At least 200 guests sa down to an excellent luncheon served at one long table in a marquee. The ay ended with a fantastic Avar dance by Nejdi tribesmen, a barbaric pantomime j P an&lt; T 2 0 ^ ou 1 r ‘ ^ the outset the dance centred on a gigantic Royal an ai , but before long standard and standard-bearer were dancing Avith the 7 Not only had Egypt been ignored in the speech of the evening, but the tLgyptian consul had been given a comparatively poor place at table. These circumstances may account for his absence from the Wady Fatma party. Some er diplomatic abstentions were due to indisposition and were less noticeable.8. I apologise for the length at which I have described these proceedings They are worthy of attention for various reasons. It was suggested last vear that such a celebration was un-Islamic. The contrary view has triumphed Secondly, no one present could fail to be struck by the element of Saudian propa: f a n s?i a v a tbe , T T lstence on his^sses as being great Arab achievements Meas^wMch mTrouH ““P 1 '® 11 , 186 , between Wah abi strictness and European .ideas, which Mr. Bond noticed last year, was again definitely present The tervals for prayer were duly observed, but during the Prince's absence many members of his entourage strolled with us under the palms and smoked freely in our company. Although the music at the Wady Fatma party was all sung, the inhabitants of the district used musical instruments undisturbed within earshot ol us, nor was there any lack of drums in the war dance.

Kuwait will I trust now go forward on the road to prosperity, and may equal Bahrain in its new forward policy. This will not be difficult if you continue your efforts. I bear in my heart an old love for Kuwait, and think of its people with affection. I Dear also its Shaikhs every respect and do not forget iheir kind favours where 1 am concerned. I was in great ; hopes that I may succeed in re-establishing its old j commercial relations with Hejd, also that trie past friendly relations of the Sa'ud dynasty with the Sabah dynasty may once more return. But my lrlend ■ i-f. ic nnt the time yet for such an important questio:question to; be fulfilled, as my attempts in this respect both in Kuwait and at Kha'bari Wadhha, did not meet with the approval hy His Majesty the King, and they failed as did the efforts of my predecessors, I shall, however, not despair, and as long as our objects are good we must not grieve over failure. 2, We had some misunderstanding in the agreement concluded between hi s Majesty the King, and the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the £ 1Q,000{ ten thousand pounds sterling), and it appears that some interested persons made His Majesty the King understand that we had the right to delay the payment as long as Ibn Mashur and those with him were in ’Iraq, But this misunderstanding was cleared up in Sir Andrew Ryan’s interview with His Majesty the King last month* I think that His Majesty the King has now issued his orders for the payment of the sum. 3. Mr• MacDonnell the judge in the question of Trans-JordaniflL and Hejd loot, has been here in Hijaz, and after we negotiated with him for about one week he left for Trans-Jordania to study the various questions on the ground. He was a very good and int-eiligent man with wide knowledge. I sincerely trust he may succeed in his work, but I have little hope that conditions will impio\^ between Kejd and Trans-Jordania, owing to the existence of the Ameer Abdullah who is not like Faisal but taken after his father in his thoughts, ideas and inclinations. This week I saw the treaty of ’Iraq with Greatik. Great Britain, and I found it to be of decided worth, hut according to what we have read in the telegrams, it has created much opposition in ■Iraq, and one does not know whether it will he ratified hy the Iraq Parliament, or meet the fate of Ja’far Pasha al-■Askari 1 s treaty of 1927 * 5, The condition of the financial world is even less favourable than the political, especially in the East.

M Talf' as far as Suez# I gave a small dinner party in his honour last evening, in the course of which be said that he expected to Stax’* about a fort night in Bgypt and would go on to London via Marseilles* 2. The record of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba is so well known to you that it is unnecessary for me to say anything of his antecedents. T have not seen enough of him to have formed anv personal estimate of his present outlook. T give with reserve the following impressions derived from reports which have reached me:- (a) . He would be glad to see much closer relations between Great Britain and this counts on terms favourable to the latter* (b) He is hostile to the 5 Syrian Party , the protagonists in which are ieh are Sheikhs Fuad Hamza and Yussef daily hostile towards the latter, position vis-a-vis of the King is 31 s Majesty’s Pr ? rcipal Secretary of Stat# for Foreign Affairs.the King difficult. He told one of m informants nevertheless that a special code had been arranged which would enable him to eoirrmnieaie with Tbn Baud independently of the Syrians. (d) He does not think that the King is disposed to break with the Syrians at present, pertaps for reasons connected with ultimate aspirations in regard to Syria* Tt is suggested even that Ibn Baud hopes one day to secure the throne of that country for one of Ms sons. 3. I may mention in this connection that -©ports have been rife for some time to the effect that the King intends to make the Emir Pei sal Minister of Foreign Affairs, retaining the services of Fuad Hamas as a subordinate. 4. Hafi* 'stt-a told the Informant already mentioned that the Eeja® Government Intended to establish Consulates at Bombay and Singapore and that there was a dispute as to whether they should be under him as Minister in London or directly under the Unistrr of Foreign Affairs here. 6 .

Sheikh Abderrahman T s visit will probably coincide with the arrival in London of Sheikh Hafiz ^Vahba, the Hejazi Minister to the Court of Saint James.

IN the note on various matters of protocol enclosed in my despatch No. 114 of the 18th instant, I referred to the question of formal visits by foreign representatives to King Ibn Sand’s Heir Apparent as one which had not been raised in my conversa tions with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and which need not arise at present. I have the honour to state that it has in fact arisen much sooner than I anticipated. 2. Late in the evening of the 25th May, I received a telephone message from the assistant to the Governor of Jedda to the effect that the Emir Saud was arriving early next morning, and would receive me the next morning at 10-10 a.m. On enquiry, I found that the intention of the Prince was to receive the foreign repre sentatives officially, and. that uniform would be appropriate. He received us in succession, beginning with the Soviet Minister, at the Green Palace, which, Sheikh Fuad Hamza tells me, is now definitely the property of the King. I took with me the same party, minus the Legation interpreter, as when I presented credentials. The Prince, who was attended by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, placed me on a sofa beside him. The reception was on the same lines as the less formal part of the proceedings when the King himself received me. . . , 3. The Governor of Jedda had issued invitations for a dinner, given also at the Palace, but apparently by the local authorities, in honour of the Heir Apparent It was a hot evening, and it was happily arranged that the European guests mig wear ordinary evening dress, in which vogue of attire a black dinner jacket, all do not own to it, is still the high-water mark in Jedda. Having surmounted the perils of a staircase roughly laid with a carpet almost completely unsecured by rods, Mr Bond and I were conducted to the roof. Having been welcomed by the Governor, we passed between a double file of armed retainers to the furthest end where the Prince received us. The Soviet Minister had already arrived, and we took our places right andteft of His nts the company of twenty-three peopje. including all the foreign representatives, except the Turk and the Persian and the principal officials of Jedda and the King’s entourage went ind^e to a long narrow dim g room which with attendant servants and slaves, we pretty completelv n . _ ^ is s szssis.s assures me. were pi an f u,af got going slender, he resembles his father cast in a ne , , . , ^ an( j [,6 has a most are well marked and he conceals his eye trouble behind g“ anct He confined it engaging smile.

After dinner His my Russian colleague^ echoed with contributimis t h SU pp 0Se that Islam Highness reverted to the.subject, and said how Approach to the ^eS^f an alien faSTsaid that, indeed, there should be no conflict. I related [139 r—1]how I myself, going to church in Hnmpstetid one Sundny morning in n tramcar, otherwise empty except for the driver and the conductor, had heard one of them say to the other : “ What do we want with .... religions now we’re civilised? ” and how much more civilised I liad felt myself to be than the speaker. It gave me some satisfaction to have this simple tale translated by the representative of Soviet Russia, although I had to omit the epithet preceding “ religions. 6. On the 27th May the Prince sent two persons, the Assistant Governor anT the officer commanding the garrison, to return the visit which I had paid him. 7. The Emir was expected to stay here a few days, but he changed all his plans and returned to Mecca on the evening of the 27th May. I hear from a confidential source that his recall was due to the arrival of news of some trouble in Nejd. I cannot vouch for this information, but as it was the Prince’s first visit to Jedda since 1926 there must have been some important reason for his sudden departure. 8. As my main object in writing this despatch is to provide a full record for future reference of ceremonial now observed here, I may mention that, in addition to calling officially on the other foreign representatives after I had presented my credentials, I also called on the Governor of Jedda, as being the chief local authority in what is becoming the diplomatic capital. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.THIS DOCofeBICT IB THE FBOFEKTI ..-0F--H1&amp; MAJESTY'S GOYEENMEKT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. Q r, v- ^... j June 10, 1930. Section 1. 'E 3039/334/91] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 10.) (No. 114.) Sir, Jedda, May 18, 1930. WITH reference to my telegram No. 58 of the 17th instant, I have the honour to state that King Ibn Saud came from Mecca to Jedda on the morning of that day and received me in the forenoon for the purpose of my presenting my credentials. The ceremonial was carried out in accordance with the rules forwarded in Mr. Bond’s despatch No. 332 of the 28th December last. The duties of Master of Ceremonies were performed by Hamdi Bey, the Officer Commanding the garrison in Jedda, who conducted me from my residence to what has been dubbed the £ ‘ Green Palace.’ ’ This is a modern house of some pretension built by the Director of Customs, a gentleman of poor origin, who, by assiduous application to the duties of his office, has, in recent years, acquired considerable wealth. It is possible that he has already carried out a rumoured intention of presenting the house to the King, who has, hitherto, made use of the barracks, or of the houses of certain resident notables, when he has visited Jedda. 2. My staff and I with Hamdi Bey were conveyed to the “Green Palace’’ in two very moderate cars driven by still more moderate chauffeurs and not otherwise attended. As we were about to start, one of the telephone posts opposite my front door swayed towards me and gently deposited its load of wires in the fairway. This was the only untoward incident. Military honours were rendered at the Palace, but naturally without any playing of the National Anthem, which might be considered appropriate in an oriental setting, were music not abhorrent to Wahabite piinciples. The arrangements generally were simple but sufficiently dignified. I was received by Sheikh Fuad Hamza and other officials including Hafiz Waffiba, the Minister Designate in London. After a short interval, I was conducted with Mr. Bond and the Legation interpreter into the audience chamber, where the King m solitary state awaited us and his own officers. After he had shaken hands with me delivered the speech which I had prepared and handed to His Majesty my letter of eredence When my interpreter had read an Arabic version, the King s reply was read by his secretary, Yussef Yasin, and then in a very good English translation by Sheikh Fuad Hamza. I next formally presented my staff consisting of Mr Bond (whom I said, it was hardly necessary to introduce as he ^ a ^ /r be ®r i r .® x ® rcis ^ &amp; ^ functions of agent and consul and, later, Charge d’Affaires), Mr. Wikeley, Minis i Ihsanullah, the British Indian vice-consul, and the interpreter 3 I had been told that the King would not dismiss me at the end of the formal part of tL audience, as it was Ms custom to detain the Uve -d wat^ or the latter to seek permission to leave. Following this practice His Majesty mvitea us all to be seated and had coffee and lemonade served 'Y^XTthe Kfngihtafth ordinary oriental ago He e/pressed pfeasure on making special ref e ! e found His Majesty when I kissed hands. He emphasised hearing how well I had found His iViajesryw j lied that I had had his desire for good ^fYntiSen^of the same kind in all circles at home, when I evidence of a reciprocal sentim ent o m h of comp liments I retired, my was preparing to come to Jedda. .yYickwards and bowing in accordance with remained alone while Ms officers than I had expected in high-flown 4.

His of the usual Arabian ^ her was a r oom of moderate size, well-carpeted, tot olheiwffie furMsfed M a debased French style. The most conspicuous object was [139 k—1]2 a green panel high in the wall behind the King, embroidered with the Moslem profession of faith and a hefty sword underneath. 5. After the audience Sheikh Fuad Hamza asked whether I had any objection to a photograph being taken. On my acquiescing an Egyptian photographer from Cairo, who works for the c ‘ Graphic ” and other papers, took several pictures. In the meantime the King himself had, apparently at the suggestion of some of hfff officers, intimated his willingness to be photographed also, and a final photograph was taken, in which he occupied the centre of the group with myself on his right. I then again took leave of him and left the Palace with the same ceremony as when I arrived. 6. I have ventured to describe these proceedings at some length, as it was the first occasion on which a British Minister presented credentials, although Mr. Bond and previous agents have of course been frequently received by King Ibn Saud. I enclose a copy of my speech* together with the English version* of that read on behalf of the King. It may be useful for record if I enclose also a note on certain matters of ceremonial which I had discussed with Fuad Hamza.* Later in the morning of the audience I visited the latter in the manner described in my note. We had a cordial conversation on things in general and the system of examination for the British Diplomatic and Consular Services in particular. He took an oppor tunity of drawing my attention to the extremely democratic ways of his Sovereign, who did not lay the same stress on punctilio as other rulers. This remark was possibly intended to explain away any departures made by an inexperienced Court from consecrated practice. 7. Following what is I understand a usual practice, Sheikh Fuad Hamza enter tained me at dinner on the evening of the 17th May at the local office of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The company of fourteen included the leading local notables, Hafiz Wahba, and the principal members of my staff besides Mr. Taylor, Messrs! Gellatly Hankey’s manager, and Mr. Philby. Water was served copiously, first, Vichy, and, when that ran out, the product of the Jedda condenser. It was intimated to me after dinner that cigarettes would not be handed round, but that I was free to smoke my own. I refrained from doing so. 8- Saud left Jedda on the evening of the 17th May. His destination was TaH, where, it appears, the Heir Apparent, Emir Saud, is to be operated on for eye trouble by an Egyptian surgeon. This has led to the cancellation of a visit by the Emir baud to Jedda, which was planned for the 19th May, and during which I was to meet the prince at another party of Fuad Hamza’s. Fuad Hamza, himself, is also returning to Mecca to-day. In these circumstances, I cannot hope to do any personal business with either him or the King before the 25th May, but I have'reason to that day nat W1 ^ ec ^ a a g a i n i n the course of the week beginning on 9.

(No. 109.) y ' Sir, Jedda JMay 9 1930 TV ITH reference to my telegram No. 53 of the 6th instant, I have the honour to state that I left London for J edda on the 22nd April and arrived here on the 6tli May via Marseilles and Port Sudan. At the latter place I was very hospitably entertained by the commissioner, Major D. S. B. Thomson, and had the advantage of discussing with him many matters of Red Sea interest. 2- The arrangements for transporting me from Port Sudan to Jedda in H.M.S. ‘'Dahlia” were carried out most admirably by Commander R. A. Jackson, R.N. I should be grateful if a suitable expression of thanks could be conveyed to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, provided you see no objection. 3. The Hejaz authorities went out of their way to show attention to me on my arrival. The Governor of Jedda sent the officer commanding the garrison to welcome me on board the “ Dahlia,” and himself came down to the landing-stage to receive me. In addition to his own greetings, he brought me complimentary messages from the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its dependencies, including an expression of regret that His Majesty had had to leave Jedda (where he had been spending a couple of days), and would be unable to receive me until after the pilgrimage. After responding suitably to these courtesies, I drove to the Legation in a car provided by the Governor. 4. In the evening the King caused further messages to be telephoned to me, and again confirmed them next morning. In addition to replying in the same manner, I asked the Governor, when calling on him on the morning of the 7th May, to convey my warmest thanks to the King, as he, the Governor, was about to go to Mecca for the pilgrimage. At this visit, the Governor, after a cordial exchange of compli ments, discoursed to me at some length on the improvements made by Ibn Saud in the arrangements for the pilgrimage, his desire to improve them still further, and his anxiety to collaborate wuth His Majesty’s Government in doing^ as much as possible to ensure the well-being of pilgrims, especially from the sanitary point of view. I assured the Governor that His Majesty’s Government appreciated what had been done, and w r ould be most ready to harmonise their efforts in the same direction on behalf of British pilgrims with those of the King of the Hejaz. 5. I am happy to think that everything connected with my arrival went m such a way as to create a good local impression and to emphasise the importance of the decision of His Majesty’s Government to appoint a Minister here. By a fortunate coincidence, my arrival took place on Accession Day. The firing of a further salute and the dressing of ships, including a large number of pilgrim ships in honour of that anniversary, gave additional dignity to the visit ot 6 On the 7th May, I wrote to the Emir Feisal as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to ask formally for an audience to present my credentials. Although I have had no 5 reply as yet, I have reason to think that the audience wall be fixed for an early day after the 12th May.

I took the opportunity of assuring the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that I should continue to devote myself to the cultivation of friendly relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Great Britain, and added a few complimentary remarks.

I HAVE the honour to report that the accession of King Ibn Sand was celebrated on the 8 th and 9th January in conformity with an elaborate programme of festivities which had been devised for the occasion. These were the first celebrations of the sort that have taken place, and it is stated that the King was at first opposed to them, although he subsequently gave his consent. 2. In Jedda the streets were beflagged and a general holiday was proclaimed on the 8 th January. The day began with receptions and a salute of 101 guns, the foreign representatives and consuls and their staffs in uniform being received by the Governor at 11 a.m. Simultaneously, the Emir Eeisal was holding a reception of notables in Mecca. 3. In the afternoon the Emir Feisal arrived from Mecca for a review of the local troops outside the town at Kandara. These consisted of a company of infantry of the Jedda garrison in their semi-European uniform, who presented a rather sorry spectacle compared with a few wild horsemen and a picturesque contingent of about 200 men on gaily caparisoned camels who followed. The artillery was represente by the four saluting guns, which were drawn by mules commandeered from the market place for the purpose. The review was preceded by tea at the palace at Kandara, to which some 300 guests had been invited. . , , 4. In the evening an official banquet was held at Kandara at which abou 150 guests were present, including the foreign representatives and a number ol representatives of the leading Egyptian newspapers, who had been invited by the Heiaz Government to attend the celebrations. The banquet was the occasion ±oi a number of complimentary speeches extolling the virtues of the King and the progress made under his reign. There had, I am told been a ^p dispute between the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Governor of Jedda 88 t° deliver the Government’s address. The matter had been referred to the Emu who had decided as a compromise that Sheikh Fuad’s speech should be read by a citizen of ’V^Veikh Fuad’s speech was in the main also a eulogy of the King and his works'. He enumerated the objects which the King had set .yt^ieve since his accession and commented on the results obtained.

I have not delayed in doing so, as the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs recently raised the subject again and was obviously anxious that the change should take place as soon as possible. I am, furthermore, due to preside at a banquet on the 24th instant, at which all the chief officials of the Government and the leading notables of Jedda and Mecca, about eighty persons in all, are to be present. The moment seems to me, therefore, to be particularly opportune for notifying the Hejaz Government of the fact, and I do not anticipate in the near future any occasion for doing so on which a better impression is likely to be created. 3.

Copy of to ^ SEEN BY SIR A. HIRTZEL. 8 JAN 1930 Previous Papers :— FOR INFORMATION. The private correspondence of which copies are now forwarded oy the Foreign Office is of interest. Fuad Hamsa is clearly entirely within his rights in suggesting that the precedence of the various diplomatic representatives at Jeddah must oe governed in accordance with the usual diplomatic practice - i.e., the date of their arrival and the presentation of their credentials. The arguments against pressing for any special recognition in this respect for the British representative are clearly set out in Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 14th November to Mr. 3997b 2000 10.29 f Bond. SEEN PCU'JltAL .COMMiTTQ JAN 1930 rCOPY. (E 5693/821/91) Confidential. 26 14th November, 1929. Dear Bond, Kany thanks for your letter No.2224/1346/6 of October 19, in which you suggest that if His Majesty 1 6 Government agree in principle to raising the status of the Agency at Jeddah to that of a Legation, it should be stipulated that the British Minister or Charg£ d•Affaires should always take precedence over his colleagues, irrespective of other considerations. I am asked to let you know that, while we quite realise that this arrangement might have certain advantages, there are on the other hand political reasons which render it impracticable. Ao you know, one of the chief difficulties in the way of the establishment and maintenance of close and cordial relations between this country and Ibn Baud is the accusation which both his enemies and ours are only too prone to make, that he is in our pockets* It is tnercior© imoort&amp;nt from every point of view to avoid doing anything which might give the impression that he is more definitely dependent on us than on other Powers, or tbftt we hold a predominant position in the Hejaz and Nejd as of right. To rnake the raising of the Agency to a Legation conditional on the British Minister holding perpetual precedence over all his colleagues would simply be playing into the hands of these people and would therefore weaken rather than strengthen our position, while any small advantage that might be gained in the way of local prestige, or convenience in the transaction of business, would be many times outweighed by the handle we should be giving to anti- Ibn Baud and anti-British propaganda all over the Fast. The Bond.Esq.T.:ie position in Egypt and Iraq, where the British high Commissioners have precedence over everybody else, does not offer a real parallel, as both those countries are in 11 special relations' with Great Britain which involve, for instance, the presence of British troops on Egyptian and Iraqi soil. In the Hej&amp;z our predominance is merely a question of fact, due to the geographical position and to our Ilosleia interests, and that predominance is unlikely to be seriously affected one way or another by the formal precedence of the British Representative at Jeddah. In these circumstances, we see no alternative to following the ordinary rules of diplomatic and consular precedence in the lie jaz, and this is apparently all that Fuad Hamza is trying to do. We are glad to have your information about the possibility of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs being built outside the town walls etc,, and agree with you that it is still too early to discuss plans for acquiring a site with a view to building a Legation in this new quarter. The question of securing adequate accommodation will no doubt have to be taken \ip if and when the principle of establishing a Legation is approved. Yours sincerely, (Signed) G* %Rendel.26 1 (IS 6^77/821/91) SO.£569/339/6. 1950 ; J £« u : DA * 28 th November, 1929 Dear jendel. You will have gathered Iro.Ti iqy despatoh lo.^ol ■ ot b h e ± 9 th it, a tail t that the vexed ^ueetion of preoedenoe amorg the foreign representatives here hea been settled in so far as Fuad Hamza, is o ora erred. I thought it a good thing however to find out exactly what his views were, and an opportunity presented itself for doing so at an interview which I had with him two or three days ago. In referring to the gmir’a visit and the banquet in the evening of the 17 th, I stated that, without wishing to enter into contentious questions at the present juncture, I should lifce to know the position, as the present was, I thought, the first occasion on which Hi Majesty's i&lt;e presents live had not been given precedence at a public function in Jed da. Fuad Hamza replied that he was glad that I had mentioned the matter as he had himself intended to speak to me about it. He then ©.'plained that he regarded the British, Turkish, Soviet and now the French, representatives as of equal rank whose precedence w?s governed, in accordance with the usual diplomatic practice, by the date of their arrival and the presentation of their credentials. Following this procedure he considered the order of precedence to be furk, .Soviet, British, French. he then went on to talk aoout the eatable jhiiient of Legations and said that the Hejaz Government had first of all themselves approached the British Government with a request to raise the status of this post. Thereupon the soviet and the French Governments had come forward with a request to establish Legations also. H® gave me to understand that .hendel, ^sq. heort no had put them off jo that every ore oould start fair, and X thirit thet that may be the reason why ny French oolle^igue, who I suspeot wai ted to , et in first, did not present his ore den tit Is to the nmir last week: as he had originally intended. For the same reason Fuad H*- t&amp;ze had ashed that the Turkish 'kepresentative' should not be riven the title 01 Uridter or Oharg 4 d’Aliaires, although his predecessor had been a linister xlenipotei tiary. I did not enter into a diso us aion on the su b j eot although I thought it as wall to let Fuad Hamza have a plain hint that I had noted a d should report the changed position of the british representative. For one thing, I don’t see any real grounds on which we oar now object to the order of precedence as indicated and for ai other thing it seemed to me best not to say sny more while the question of a Legation is sub Judies. There have een no further occasions since those reported in my despatch where the question of precedence has arisen and, as tie grain returned to ieoca to-day, there may n o t be o t h er o a r&amp; s i on &amp; for so rug li ttle t i me. Fuad namza's exaggerated idea of the importance of this setter to the foreign representatives is perhaps natural in view of what has happened in the past and in consequence of the action h ken by the ,oviet and French Representa tivea. It will oe a good t ing when the question of Legations and precedence is settled aid he can be disabused of ti e idea that the fiejaz Government is a diplomatic ..iondyke and that there is a rush to ^ stake out claims. :! r, 1.

E 3132/2127/91 of July 5, regarding a recent conversation held by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Hejazi representative on the International Postal Congress, with a member of this department r I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter which has now been received from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in regard to Ibn Sand*a desire for the establishment of full diplomatic relations with this country. 2. As Mr. Secretary Wedgwood Benn will have observed from the Foreign Office letter referred to above, the Sheikh was recently informed that the establishment of a Hejazi Embassy in London was entirely out of the question. It is / probable, however, that the Sheikh, not being conversant either with the English language or with diplomatic usage, is making a confusion between the establishment of an Embassy and that of a Legation. Bor does it seem necessary at this stage to take up with him the question of his own nomination to be Hejazi Representative in London, a nomination which could not of course in any case be accepted without the usual prior request for an agrement, even if a decision had yet been reached on the main question of principle involved. 3. ^s regards this question, however, the Secretary of State is of opinion that the time has now corne when the establishment j The Under Secretary of State, India Office. iestablishment of regular diplomatic relations with King Ibn Saud should be carefully and sympathetically reconsidered. As Mr. Wedgwood Bonn will recollect, Sir G. Clayton, who is able to speak with almost unique authority on Arabian affairs, after his return from his negotiations with King Ibn baud in August of last year, was strongly in favour of the British Representative in Ihn Satid f s dominions holding definite diplomatic rank and status. The relations of His Majesty* s Government with Ihn Saud have considerably developed during the last few years, and Mr. Wedgwood Benn will no doubt agree that it is not open to question that His Majesty’s Government should take all steps open to them to help His Majesty* and to strengthen his position* on any occasion and in any manner which may be possible and suitable• 4. On general political grounds, therefore, Mr. Henderson considers that the time has now arrived for converting His Maj;esty t s Hgency at Jeddah into a diplomatic mission, and I am to express the hope that Mr. Wedgwood Bsnn will concur in this view. 5 # Should it be decided that* on general grounds, the appointment of a British diplomatic officer to the Hejaz, and that of a Hejazi diplomatic representative to this country, are desirable, Mr. Henderson would propose to cause the necessary steps to be taken forthwith to consider how the various minor technical difficulties involved can best be overcome - i.e* the selection of a suitable the making of appropriate arrangements for salary candidate,similar nature salary t allowances, housing etc, and other points of a similar nature. suggested in paragraph £ above, he proposes, subject to Mr.Wedgwood Benn's concurrence, to defer considering the question of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba’s personal appointment, until a decision has been reached on the general question of principle dealt with above. 6. ** similar letter is being sent to the Colonial Office, and a copy of this letter is being sent to the Air Ministry.

You will remember that it was generally held that the Amir Faisal found Hafiz too masterful a tutor and had him nomin ated to attend the abortive meeting at Koweit so as to get him out of the country for a bit. His subsequent relegation to the post of Minister for Education was taken as a clear indication of the ground he had lost since the days when he ”ran fT the Hejaz as King’s Counsellor and Assistant Viceroy. Hafiz now seems to be on the lookout for a suitable opportunity to get baek into power ana we in Jedda, doubtless most improperly, regard hie ' manoeuvres in Cairo as evidence of his adaptability to the means available. At present he is fighting a losing battle with the Syrian element round Ibn Sand but if he were to regain the King's favour he would probably oust Fuad Hamsa. prove in spite of his past history distinctly pro-British and perhaps very amenable, in sum he is likely to seek an opportunity in London to eztend his activities beyond purely postal business.

The correspondence near the beginning of the volume discusses Ibn Saud's [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd's] wish to enter into full diplomatic relations with the British Government. The Hejazi Government's proposal in 1929 to establish a legation in London is accompanied by a request for the British Government to raise the status of its Agency and Consulate in Jedda to the same status.The subsequent correspondence in the volume discusses the following:The British Government's consideration (and acceptance) of Ibn Saud's proposal, and the appointment of Sir Andrew Ryan as His Majesty's Minister at the British Legation in Jedda in May 1930.Hafiz Wahba's appointment as Hejazi Minister in London in 1930.Complaints made by the Hejazi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding Sir Andrew Ryan's attitude and conduct since his arrival in Jedda.Details of an Hejazi-Nejdi diplomatic mission to Europe (including visits to Italy, France, Britain, and the Netherlands), undertaken in May 1932 and headed by Amir Feisal [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd], Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs (this part of the volume includes detailed accounts of the mission's meetings with Foreign Office officials during its visit to London).Sir Andrew Ryan's account of his meeting with Ibn Saud at Taif in July 1934, and their discussion of the 'blue line' (the frontier which marked the Ottoman Government's renunciation of its claims to Bahrain and Qatar, in the Anglo-Ottoman convention of 1913) and the Kuwait blockade.Details of several meetings held at the Foreign Office between Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia), Sir Andrew Ryan and George William Rendel (Head of the Foreign Office's Eastern Department), during September 1934, regarding the 'blue line', the Kuwait blockade, and the future of the Treaty of Jedda (the treaty signed between Britain and Ibn Saud in 1927).Requests from the Italian Government for information regarding Fuad Bey Hamza's visit to London.The volume features the following principal correspondents: His Majesty's Agent and Consul at Jedda, a position that was raised to His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jedda in late 1929 (Hugh Stonehewer Bird, William Linskill Bond, Cecil Gervase Hope Gill, and Albert Spencer Calvert successively); His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome (Ronald William Graham); Ibn Saud; Amir Faisal; officials of the Hejazi/Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, and the India Office.In addition to correspondence, the volume contains a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East. The meeting, which took place in London on 8 November 1934, was primarily concerned with the settlement of the 'blue line' issue, the Saudi-Transjordan frontier, and the Kuwait blockade.The volume includes two dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaty of Jeddah (1927)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Italy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Jedda</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000271#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
