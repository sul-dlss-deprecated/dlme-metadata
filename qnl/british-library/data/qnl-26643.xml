Sir, ¥lth reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch No. 417 of the 14th August, I have the honour to inform you that the visit of Seyed Ifuhammed Sahara, Minister of Court of the Yemen, has been given considerable prominence in the Persian press. 2. In an interview published in the ’’Journal de reheran” of the 21et August, Seyed Huhararaed 2ubara, after suitably flattering reference to the progress of Iran and to the personality of the Shah and the Valiahad, by both of whom he was received, went on to refer to the historical friendship between Iran and the Yemen. He said that he hoped that this friendship would shortly be further strength ened by the visits of YemeniPrinces, possibly of sons of the Imam, and that he thought it likely that Yemen students would soon be sent to study at the University of Tehran. He added that this extension of relations between the Yemen and Iran necessitated the creation of a Yemeni Diplomatic Mission in ’ehran and the appointment of A Iranian representative^ to Sanaa. 3. Whether seyed Muhammed Sahara's statements are of any importance remains to be seen. In any case, Monsieur Motaaedy, now Head of the Hear Astern Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently informed a member of /«y The Right Honourable Anthony Sden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.my staff that the present visit was of no political importance # and this is home out by the fact that f though a dinner was given to the distinguished visitor by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs* Monsieur Motamedy* who was on holiday within easy reach of Tehran* did not bother to return to the capital to attend it. Monsieur Motamedy thought that aeyed Muhammad Sahara's visit was largely to be explained by the fact that he was a Shiah* and he has in fact now left Tehran to make a pilgrimage to Meshed. 4. According to the 'Journal de T^hSran' * Seyed Muhammad Zubara will return to his country by way of Iraq* Syria and liigypt. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad No* 65 and to the Resident at Aden, No. 604/4/36. I have the honour to be with the highest respect* Sir* Your most obedient* humble Servant* (Signed) Kevils Bail</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2150</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2150</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/77 'Yemen: Yemeni-Perso Relations.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-22T22:46:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 5; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file concerns relations between the Yemen and Iran (also referred to as Persia in the correspondence).
