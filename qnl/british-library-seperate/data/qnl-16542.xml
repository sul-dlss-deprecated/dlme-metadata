MacLeod also mentions his unsuccessful endeavours to settle a dispute between Rauma bin Jabir [Raḥmah bin Jābir al-Jalāhimah] and the Shaikh of Bahrain [Salmān bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah]. He writes that should the dispute break into open hostility, they would not be justified in interfering apart from to prevent other tribes becoming involved. He suggests that vessels should be employed to cruize the various pearl banks in the vicinity of Bahrain during the diving season. MacLeod asks Hardy if he could spare a cruizer for such a purpose.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
