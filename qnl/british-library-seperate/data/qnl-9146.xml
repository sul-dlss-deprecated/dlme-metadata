The British Government held that in the absence of international agreement, three miles was the extent of territorial waters, but the Persian Government claimed distances of up to twelve miles at various times. The issue is discussed by various British officials, especially the Foreign Office, Admiralty, and HM Minister, Tehran. Folios 84-120 discuss Persian jurisdiction over the outer anchorage in Bushire. Folios 9-79 discuss the concession area held by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in view of the fact that potential oil fields lay under the Persian Gulf, partly beyond the three-mile limit, but within the twelve-mile limit claimed by the Persian Government.The French language content of the file consists of six folios of diplomatic correspondence between British and Persian officials.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kowr-e Deyreh (anchorage)</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
