The first begins with the first letter and runs from number 1 through to number 55. There follows a gap of one folio, and then a second foliation sequence starts on the verso side of what would have been number 56 in the first foliation sequence. This sequence is inconsistent in that it is paginated from number 56 up to number 109, where it then lapses back into foliation and runs through to number 332, the last typescript folio. The third and most recent foliation sequence begins on the first typescript folio, which is loose. It runs from number 1 through to number 281, which is the inside of the back cover. It should be noted that folio 60 in this sequence is followed by folio 60 A, which is then followed by number 61. The first foliation sequence is written in blue and red crayon, in the top right corner of each folio. The second foliation sequence (which contains some pagination) is written in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio (and in the top left corner of the verso side of those folios that are paginated). The third foliation sequence, which should be used for cataloguing, is written and circled in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence concerning Abu Musa island.
