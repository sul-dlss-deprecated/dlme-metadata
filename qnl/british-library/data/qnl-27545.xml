Orders were received by the Customs authorities at Khorramshahr on the 20th from the Central Administration, Tehran, prohibiting the importation of goods from and exportation of goods to Italy. Goods which are already on their way from Italy are, however, allowed to reach their destination in Iran. As a result it is believed that the new Naval floating dry dock will not be forthcoming, and that the Iranian Navy will be unable to procure any further requirements from Italy owing to retaliatory measures by Italy.EXTRACT PROM PERSIA^ GULP INTELLIGENCE REPORT POR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER» 1^35.

Extract from the Persian Gulf Intellifence Report for the month of August 1935, received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Naval Depot, Mohammerah . When returning a call at the Navy Office, it was observed that all naval ratings seen were most punctilious with regard to saluting. The buildings and offices were well laid out in pleasant surroundings. Recruits were undergoing field training and there was considerable activity on the foreshore where piles are being driven. Lieutenant Chahin, who was deputising for Lieutenant Coj-onel Bayendor, said that one of the two barges towed out from Italy by NETROUS was to be used for oil in the Gulf. Naval Base . The rumour that the Persians intend to establish other bases in the Gulf has been reported previously. In Tehran, the same story was heard and this time the Japanese were credited with receiving the contract. The position selected was said to be in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas. 10. New Construction . Prom the above source, it was also reported that the Persians had ordered four warships from Japan, though whether these were supposed to be ,T vedettes M or larger is not known. H» Floating Dock .

'*,-*-**- ^ * -* 35. Cruioers . 4 it Abadan, there have been fresh rumours about the construction of cruisers for Persia - possibly those mentioned in Admiralty letter M.01578/33 datea 26th February 1934. Persian officers in conversation with anglo-persian Oil Company officials, have expressed their belief that the contract will be given to Frahce, the reasons given being (a) that officers are now being trained there, (b) that Persians are not very satisfied with Italian construction, and (c) that the French language is more generally known and is of greater use. 37. From the same source, it is also rumoured that orders have been sent to Italy to increase tne size of the floating dock building there. 38. There may be some foundation in these rumours when read in conjunction with a report in the latest R .A.F. Intelligence Report, which states that the Shah is attempting to negotiate a loan in Paris of 750,000,000 francs (£10,000,000), repayable in 20 years, to be delivered in Persia In tne form of war material. 39. During his recent period of duty In Tehran, Commander Bayendor is aileged to have discussed the question of cruisers with the shah. He is credited with having pointed out that there will be insufficient trained ratings to riian all ships, ana that repair, base and storing facilities will be necessary before such a large addition to the Persian Navy can be contemplated.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE^ftfOPERT^OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ’RZ~\ ^ *■ ‘ PERSIA. ,&lt;&lt;a P K I DENTIAL. / r July 3, 1934.

According to rumour the lersiar: have cancelled the engagement of the French surveyor Bcnard (referred to in the report forward ed under cover of my Ho.782/i2.I.2272C of 8th Hovember. 1922) and that a Danish engineer named Kendt, who has been wording at Bandar Shahpur recently, has tahen his place at Mohammerah and is now engaged in planning a graving dock and other naval buildings. If the contract for a floating dock has really been signed with Italians it seems highly improbable that a graving dock is projected as well. (Sgd.) M.J2.D.-HASMITK. Vice Admiral. • « VNotes.

Prdcis of conversation with Lieutenant Bucconi of the Italian Navy attached to the Persian f {■ Navy - • MW \ l Submitted. The following is a precis of a conversation with Lieutenant Bucconi, the senior Italian executive Officer with the Persian Navy. The conversation took place on board H.M.S.ENTERPRISE on the night of the dance on board at Abadan. It was fairly late in the evening and Bucconi was communicative, and at the end even expansive. He seemed disgruntled with his lot and on that account his statements, though his own genuine opinions, may be biassed to seme extent. 2. He lives at the Anglo Persian Oil Company Rest House at Mohammerah. Living on board is most uncomfortable on account of the bad food, and mess conditions generally. There are five (?) Italian officers still with the Persian squadron. They are all liable to be sent to any ship where they are wanted, so naturally go where there is any trouble. They are much handicapped by the fact that the Persian officers are soldiers rather than sailors, and p&lt;?.rticularly by the Commanding Officer, Major Bayandor, being a soldier. The Persian officers are not fully trained. It is impossiole to train a Naval Officer in two years: (this was not clear as they were in Italy far more than two years). They are over-confident and his heart is always in his mouth when they are handling tneir ships. Their navigation is very rudimentary. Although they have had the technical training their methods are crude to a degree. He is very afraid of them putting themselves ashore. The/• » 2. 4-b 1 The ratings sign on nominally for two years, hut they do not seem likely to remain as long. When they are in arrears of pay, as they often are, they down tools or walk ashore. By far the best of the Persian officers is Sub-Lieutenant Khan Daftari, son of the Governor of Abadan - whose mother was French. The rest are very little use. He feels confident that the ships cannot continue to function long after the Italian Officers leave, particularly on the Engineering side. The Persians are more or less all right while everything is running smoothly, but as soon as anything goes wrong they attempt something for a couple of hours at most and then chuck their hands in. The ships are beginning to need docking and refit, the small ones are to be docked at the A.P.O.C. dock at Abadan - the large ones at Karachi^?). Meanwhile a floating dock is on order in Italy to be placed in Mohammerah. During a recent engagement with a dhow (presumably that reported during April) the sights were set, and kept for sane time at 3,GOO yards although the dhow was only five hundred yards away. For some time no damage was done. On another occasion - apparently in the neighbourhood of Khor Khan - the smuggling dhows got close inshore and the Persian ships could not follow within range. They nevertheless continued to waste ammunition firing out of range. (It is hard to believe that a large dhow could get close enough inshore for a small patrol vessel of 300 tons handled with determination not to be able at least to get within range. One possible explanation is that only the sloops, not the patrol boats, were there. Another, that the dhows got over a bar at high water and the Persians arrived at low water and would not wait for high water before opening fire). They don’t open fire on a dhow without boarding her first. Asked how he could distinguish a dhow of one principality from another in daytime, much less at night, he said he couldn’t. He was very apprehensive lest one of these days the worm would turn and the dhow board the sloop. The smuggling dhows are manned by good and determined fighting men all well armed. Once they got on board the crews of the Persian sloops would not have a hope. They would fire their rifles in the air and as like as not jump overboard. They have, or had, a full outfit of ammunition on board, but no reserves ashore. My informant was apprehensive about temperature of the ammunition and said they would not build underground stowage which he said they must have. This was not quite clear since they have no reserves ashore yet. My informant was evidently thoroughly disgruntled and rightly or wrongly, of the opinion that he was in a very difficult - even sometimes dangerous - position, and was anxious only to get back /back to Italy where he hoped to he given command of a destroyer. There is undoubtedly foundation for most of his statements, though it is questionable if he is a very loyal servant to the Government from whom he is at the moment drawing his pay. He struck me as being himself an officer of experience, ability and ideas. 3. The following items of information were gathered by other officers in conversation:- Bucconi complained of the lack of charts of the Persian coast. This is reasonable. ITo large' scale charts exist. Sub-Lieutenant Khan Daftari referred to by Bucconi above in conversation with Lieutenant Armstrong said he was in command of one of the small patrol boats and the senior Captain of the four. He did a trip down the Gulf in turn with the other three once every fifteen days. t He was very proud of his command and put great faith in nis Diesels. Shamals did not worry him as although there were few good anchorages he could always get under way at a few minutes notice. He had a great admiration for the Italians and was understood to say that he had done eight years in Italy (This was confirmed by his father). He said the Persian ships never work together as a unit. It was said that neither sloops nor patrol boats are allowed to fire their main armament without permission from Teheran and that in consequence they engage dhows with machine guns and rifle fire. On one occasion recently a gunboat having had trouble with her machine gun(s) wirelessed to Mohanmerah for permission to use main armament against a dhow or dhows. This was refused and another sloop was sent to help her. (Signed) P.B.Smyth, Commander-in-Chief.1 I— —y 6/53 51J933J p T 7377 195b j October 19th 1933.

Khurshid has been some two months in the Babr as an engineer on Tomans 160/- per month. He has refused to sign a contract with the Persian navy on account of unsatisfactory treatment although he has now been offered Tomans 200/- per month. His commander tried to keep him in the ship but Khurshid threatened to appeal to me and has now been allowed to go. He intends to proceed to Baghdad to get a post under the *Ira&lt;i Petroleum Company or something like that. He has volunteered the following information;- 1L?fii.Ift.P.i dent» m His friend, an Italian engineer (has the rank of Commanding Engineer in the Italian Navy and is in charge of the Italians remaining now with the Persian Navy) f who was, and still is. In the Palang tells him that the Palang went to Basidu at the end of July, and Bayendor, three other Persian Officers, Benard (the Frenchman) and himself (the Italian) landed. The four Persians had shot'^guns and on the pretext of going for a shoot left him and Benard alone. They returned later and all six went back to the ship and put to sea. $6 (the Italian) learnt later what Bayendor and the others had really done. The Persian Navy here has now been instructed to maintain very friendly relations with the British here and it seems that Major Lieutenant-Colonel G.Loch, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf2 So. Major Bayendor was reprimanded By the Shah, Major Bayendor has gone to Beyrout on 22 days' leave to get married. His fiancee is supposed to he an English girl. (Bayendor sent me p.p.c. cards from Basra, incidentally, two days ago). Major Bayendor and Captain Zelli. Zelli of the Babr is at present quarrelling with Bayendor. It is generally thought that Bayendor will try to get rid of Zelli on his return. Zelli's seamanship is had and he very nearly ran his ship full speed into the Customs place at the mouth of the river on returning from sea, hut was saved hy an Italian. Captai n Bayendor Major Bayendor's brother Captain Bayendor is said to he in trouble in Tehran in connection with a large sum of money said to have been received hy the Commander of the Chahrokh, Lieutenant Picheva, from a captured Arab dhow. An army officer came from Tehran to make enquiries, and discovered several others were involved, whereon he was bribed to keep quiet. The army officer is now said to have been arrested in Tehran as a result. Captain Bayendor proceeded to Tehran prior to going to Italy for four years' training. Persian Students. 25 Persians were sent recently to Italy for naval training in wireless, engineering, electricity etC 4 only one passed. The Persian Government is said to be annoyed and has now sent the 24 failures to France for training there. French Surveyor. M. Bernard was in receipt of pay at 1 # 500 tomans per month. He has told Major Bayendor that he cannot stand Persian habits or behaviour any longer and has now gone to Tehran to hand in his plans, etci and return to France. Italian Contract. The Persians are negotiating for one steam tug boat of 900 tons and 700 horse power, one dry dock, one steel barge for oil, and one small gun boat. The total contract is for 10 million liras. The twelve Italians at present with the Navy here are, like Benard, most discontented and want to leave. They have received3 received orders to keep quiet until the above-mentioned contract has been signed* re momements of Palang and Babr, The Palang and Babr are intending to proceed, on Major Bayendor’a return, to Karachi, Bombay and Colombo (dry docking en route at Bombay)* The object of the visit to Colombo is to return the visit of H*M.

You will of course have all their technical details, twin-screw, 3,000 H.P* Piat- c Diesel, etc., etc. They are a nifce looking little lot and size for size compare well with our sloops. I had some talk with the Persian Chief of Mission, Commandant Grholam-Ali Bayendor, a French-trained artillery man. He struck me as a decent enough fellow v/ho should not be uneasy to get on with. He seems intelligent and is liked by his Italian mentors. These are 9 in number and there are 9 Persian lieutenants and 9 apprentices. With the exception of 2 senior Italians and a G-ermane-Persian engineer, it is impossible at sight to tell t T other from which. The Italians are pleased, on the whole, with the Persian Offictis, though they find them too full of theory at present, somewhat unpractical, and very slow in the uptake, also indecisive in emergency. The crews they have little use for - they call them 'lubber-landers' when nobody T s listening. The Commandant and the Italians expect to be based on Moha mmerah, but they have no definite orders and the Commandant fears they may have to lie at Bushire for a time Henjam was not mentioned even as a possibility.

This law empowers the Minister of Finance to borrow a sum not exceeding three hundred and ninety thousand Pahlevls from the reserve funds of the country in order to meet expenses incurred in connexion with the institution oi the Persian llavy. 2 . This law was necessitated by the fact that the sum of three hundred and ninety thousand i ahlevis (equivalent to three hundred and ninety thousand pounds) set aside for this purpose had been included in the budget for the year 1310 (March 1981 - March 1932) at the rate of sixty iCrans equals one Pahlevl (or ound sterling). When the value of the Knm fell to ninety, the sum oi twenty two million, five hundred thousand rans entered in the budget was insufficient. The exchange accruing to the Oovemaent from the export of the * monopolised articles’* being also insufficient for the purpose, the Government have decided to borrow the fbll amount from the sterling depoaits held in reserve in Kurope. 3.

Gulhek,September 8,1931 e (No.488) My Lord, IN continuation of my despatch No.467 of the 20th August, I have the honour to report that the Crown Prince of Persia left Tehran for Switzerland on the 5th September. His Imperial Highness was accompanied by the Shah as far as Pahlavi, where His Majesty saw him off. Teymourtache and Diba left on the 6th September at dawn to rejoin the main party at Pahlavi, where all boarded a special steamer for Baku on the afternoon of the 7th instant. 2. The party consists of those mentioned in my despatch No.467, with the exception of the Shall 1 s daughter, who, it was decided, should remain for the present-in Tehran. The Crown Prince was accompanied by his Persian professor,^ that during his long stay in Europe he shall not forget his mother-tongue. With the party are also Colonel Reza Q,uli Khan, the director of the Pahlavi Bank and his wife. The colonel is to study banking in Lausanne for three years. 3. After having bid farewell to the Crown Prince,the Shah, attended by a small suite, will travel by the Caspian coast road to Astara and Tabriz, thence through Persian Kurdistan to Kermanshah and return to Tehran. His Majesty will be away for some twenty days. 4. The Persian Ambassador in Moscow will meet the Crown Prince in Baku and escort him through Russian territory.5. Teymourtache, after having placed the Grown Prince in school at Lausanne, will visit Berlin, where his Armenian wife has to undergo a further operation. He will then visit Vichy for a cure, go to Italy to he present at the launching of one of the Persian gunhoats, and then hopes to pay a visit to both Paris ana London. He expects to return to Persia in December. I have,&amp;c.

It will be seen that the ships in question are almost completed - one will be ready next October and the other in November. It is most unlikely that the Italian authorities would have proceeded thus far without having received payment for construction and in fact arrangementa for this have apparently been mtde vide Sinister, Tehran's despatch No.67 of May 16th, 1931. After completion the ships will of course have to undergo trials, be fitted with armament, etc., and finally make the voyage to the Gulf. This will take time, but I imagine not so very long and so we may r'lasonably expect a Persian fleet - in the shape oi one or t^o ship® - to materialise in the Persian Gulf at the beginning of next year. Bow the four motor petrol vessels are proceeding I have no informstion.

The Persian authorities will presutoably not iniorai us ox the oruisea of their ships, and the first the Political Resident will lenm of their visit to klusoat, or Bahrein or Kuwait will be a telegram from the loool Political Agent simounoing their arrirni end asking what attitude is he and tno loe?d Euler expected to t^ke up?

The fact, which 1 touched on In my letter quoted above, *aid which is confirmed in the Naval Attache*a letter, that the ahips *ill bo officered by Italian Naval officers, will not lessen the affect of any incidante which may *vriae« Being in Persian service they cannot claim apeoir 1 treatment, but any oontretemps between us and the Persian Navy, in which such officers ^re serving, may have sn unfortunate effect on ths Italian Covernaent. 6 . As to whether the Persian Navy ia likely to visit Arabian waters, yrlma faale there ould scorn to be a distinct probability of it. Otherwise it la difficult to see why the Persian/10V Pt»rei*n QoTdronbnt gone to tfta expen. o of huiing tvfo gunboat b built ior thonu Tho raison d^tre of the lour motor ree^ela ie unddratandaole. $ 1th a long co^tt line - pnrta of it even now not under control, md - owing to exorbitant cuatoae rues - a brisk amugtling trade to contend 4th, some fonu of iLOtor patrol vessel, based on the various iancll ports up end down the oooat, is a necessity* But the tvo guaboatc would appear to be more or lea: 2 of &amp; luxury, built merely lor tha purpotj e ot 'snoring the Hag*, and that thay will keep holly to Persian waters aeama to me - at the l#»*§t - unlikely. Iho poasibility of aggressions oy tho Persian Kavy on 7 tho Arabian coaet is dt?*lt with In ,iodd 1 s despatch Ko,386 of B£rd July 19?&gt;1. In 18b7 - ra ilr. :?odd pointe out - the Persian Govurniiiunt gained possession of the ialand of ; irri by seiiing It end presenting iiia Majesty* s Government with p Xait acco.nll * It ia not beyond all possibility that they might try to repeat this oour de mein on tamb or Abu dust- for insiijncu, and though doubtless they would not on this occasion be equally successful the attempt would raiao a very serious situation, Apert too ilan actual uttompts to sei&amp;e territory, minor sets of aggression on outlying Arab islands vould always be possible. 8. The opinions expressed by Hr* Itodd in paragraphs Z and 4 of his despatch would appsar to curry considerable weight. It may be impractioj ole to prevent rerai* n gun-boftto visiting Arablao waters, but if t ey do make such visits thun it would seem roout desirable thtit they nhould do uo on t eir ' lawful oocasions”, like the airships of othor nfttiong, but under some form ox' control such as previous permission or notice being applied for. If this could be arranged the usual oo xteaies in the form of salutes, interchange of visits and mutual hospitality between the local Eulers and thg ^.tioal Agents and the Commanders of gunboats, would tak* place. His Majesty's U^Ty woulfl, X * sur., U* h.ppy to oo-op.rats, ww) tnu* » ;ri«.v&gt;xy ptmosphere would be created ^hidh woul&lt; ? be flattering to the Persian/Persian Gorarnment, B nd much leaa Uk«ly to try «ggr*»aion and int#rlurcnc«. Th« r^ct too that tfce gunboata wxU bo comimdod by Italian offio r«, whila incr#m«ia^ the delioacy of any incidents which mry arise, will on the other hand make such orfioere much lese likely to lend themeelvae aecntepew. to the deaigne of the &gt;eraisn Gorornmyrt, if friendly personal relrtione hare been oemented between them and the Political and Naval author!ties in the Gulf. This friendly atmosphere, however, can only be built up on the baois of a previous arrangement with Persian Government. The alternative io to have no such arrangement when the poeaibiiity, or probability, of an impaase arising - such *b envisaged in paragraph 4 above - mu&amp;t be faced. &gt;Jm 0m? the di fioultiea brought up at the Inter departmental Conference w* a that the Peraifna might well question our right to apeak on behalf of the Kulera of the Arab coast. But- nominally at nil events - could not thetse Jxulers apef^k for th.eiaselveaY Could not t »eir coiiinmr iof tions, rg to their desire to h? ve pemiaaion asked for from them before Persian gunboata visits their waters* be handed to the Persian Government by ua acting as their Agenta - in the same w*y a a we are acting at present for Muscat via-e-via the French and Ameriosn Governments in the matter of the Muscat tariff? The Persian Government might complain that though the hands were vsau’s, the voice waa Jneob v a, but the aentimentof the oom^unicatione would at any rate be quite sincere aa the last thing the Arab rulers want is uncontrolled permission for Persian gunboata to cruise in Arab waters. Muscat is of course an independent Stnte, and presumbly could address what communication it liked (through ua) to the Persian Government - the only difficulty being that the latter have not recognised Muscat as a btate. Bahrein and Kuwait are in a different category but - by stretching a point - might possibly be allowed to send a communication through us to the erainn Government. The cognate question, of oourae, arises as to what should/should bs ths chsniiol of eomsunieetion bstwssn the P^raian &lt;ln) QoT^rnfAent Pfld ths Rulors in th# jaatt^r of psrmlssXoo or notice (sea paragraph 10 below). 1 imagine that this would have to be ' /N through ua again, as to allow independent communications between the Persian authorities an^ the Airb ulure • even on a single speoifio subject sent as movements of ships - would be undesirable. 10. The crux of the situation would appear to be the Persian claim to Bahrein, and I am of course fully alive to the serious consideration* brought forward on this point at the conference by the reprensentative of the Foreign Office, ; a th»&gt;t the Persian Government might re .ard our insistence on » control over thj visits of these ^unboate to the Arabian sosat as a species of retaliation, and in reply ma*e themselves obnoxious at Hen jam and elsewhere. But - 1 venture to would it now be possible to wrap up our request to the Persian Government In su&lt;* a way as to show that no retaliation was intended! Could we not say that on the basic of mutual co-operation in the Gulf of the two Varies - British and Persian (*) - a mutual knowledge of the movements of each other’s whips was necessary, nnd that just as British tar-ships warned Persian authorities of their visits to Persian waters so priaa ft olt there was nothing unreasonable in the request that Persian wer-ahipa should do th# same by the Arab Pulere? (This is more or lose on the lines of * suggestion mode by Colonel Bisooe at the Conference except that his views were in favour of ’permission’ not ’notice’;, ise could add - if this were thought advisable-that ee a natter of practice even H.^.Ships did not enter Arab ports without 'eralng the local Political Agent who passed the information to the Holer. If we argued on these lines then we might have to give way on the matter of * panaiaBlon' and mar.ly insist on 'notios'. 1;u but at any rate it would (a) preclude any olnla of Torsion sOTsrolgnty to tho Arob oooet; (b) prorant surprise visits} U) rseuleriso ths aituotion'•Ituation, Briefly whfit I feel personally le that sorae arrangenent with the Persian GoTerraoent previous to their Kavy materialiaing ia distinctly better than none at all, I am sending oopies of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, His Majesty’s Charge d»Affaires, Tehran and (with copy of the despatch of 89th July 1931 from the Naval Attache, ome) the Senior Warnl Officer, Persian Gulf Division, I have, etc,, (Sd) T.C.W.K) Lti, U&amp;Jor, Officiating Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf,wXf- Extract from P.Z. 6554 Teheran Intelligence Summary No.19 dated 23/9/31. 4.

No names had yet been allotted, I v/as informed that the first of these vessels would be completed by October 1931 and the second by December 1931. 2. On the 28th July 1931, I saw the four Persian Gunboats of 330 tons being built by the Cantieri Partenopei, Naples. Of these vessels the 'Karkus' had been launched tv/o days previously, and the remaining three, viz: w Simorgh M , 'Chahhaas? 1 and ’’Sharock” in August 1931. All four gunboats will be completed by the end of November 1931. 3.

CONFIDENTIAL July 10, 1930. Section 1. E 3684/36/34| No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received July 10.) (No. 290. Confidential.) Sir, Gulhek, June 26, 1930. I HAVE the honour to report that in a conversation with the Italian Charge d'Affaires I elicited the following information :— 2. M. Straneo said that early in May Teymourtache was pressing him to obtain a definite promise of early delivery of two at least of the gunboats which the Persian Government had decided to order in Italy. He replied that as soon as a definite order had been given and the sum agreed upon as advance payment handed over, two of the ships would be laid down. 3. I understood him to say that after much shilly-shallying the Persian Minister in Rome had been credited last month with the amount required as advance payment, and a definite order had been given. Two ships were accordingly laid down in May. The Italians had promised delivery if possible within fourteen months, but not later than eighteen months; this would mean some date between July and November 1931. 4. I asked M. Straneo if he could tell me what was the size and type of ship ordered. He seemed very vague about this, but said he believed they were “sort of small cruisers and very roomy ” and that there were to be four of one type, totalling 14,000 tons (displacement), and subsequently two more slightly bigger. However, all these questions had been dealt with by Captain del Prato and Major Dezan. The latter was in Italy. In connexion with the foregoing, I would refer you to the memo randum enclosed in my despatch No. 110 of the 27th February, 1929. M. Straneo believed that the two vessels ordered (and at present only two had been ordered) were to be constructed at Naples. Lie professed to have no idea what the cost would be. 5. It would be of interest if His Majesty’s naval attache in Rome were able to check this information. 6. To me the whole matter appears to be very typically Persian. The Minister of Court, having come to realise that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to make Persia a present of a number of small warships, decided, regardless of e st and on the advice of an Italian naval officer with no experience of the Persian Gulf, to order from Italy various naval units, which may well prove to be unnecessarily large and expensive to maintain while possibly ill-adapted for the only purpose for which they could be justified—namely, the prevention of contraband. 7. In the last few weeks there have been references in the Persian press to the necessity of converting Bushire into a first-class port. Taqizadeh, the Minister of Communications, spoke to Mr. Jacks, the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on the subject, and enquired what he thought would be the cost. Mr. Jacks promised to send an engineer from the marine department at Abadan to make a pre liminary enquiry. This, again, is typically Persian, to order ships first and then to enquire where they can be docked. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE.

His Highness said that Persia would like to count on our sympathy and goodwill in the matter.

I spoke to Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday about Persian navy and said that there appeared to be complete misapprehension on the part of Minister of Court. His Majesty’s Government who had frequently been asked to tender advice to foreign governments in naval matters an' to loan personnel could not contamplate sharing such responsibilities with a third government. I understood that Persian Government had now definitely ordered two ships in Italy. If Persian Government preferred that command of these vessels oe confided to British officers His Majesty’s Government would systematically consider Persian proposal but His Highness must (?group omtcw) that a combination of Italian and British officers was impossible end could only create friction. His Highness must also realise that suggestion of Minister of Court that His Majesty's Government present to Persian Government some ten ships was ridiculous. I presumed that Persian Navy v/as not intended for offensive purposes. “Certainly not”, he replied, 'nor even for defence but solely for suppression of contraband”. In that case I said I trusted Persian Government would not waste money in buying unnecessary number of ships. I had the impression that Persian Govern ment hardly realised that the bigger the ship the greater the cost of maintenance. „ . ^ From conversations last autumn with Senior Naval Officer I felt that British officers with their experience of the Persian Gulf could successfully run a contraband preventive ser/ice with minimum number of ships and at a minimum cost. His Highness said he would study the question before expressing any views.PUT AWAY WITH. Notes. Register No. P. SECRET. Minute Paper. 37*7 Is POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated 19 Rec. Date. Initials.

Similarly, there would in their opinion he strong objection to Persian patrol vessels being commanded hy officers of another European Power. You should hear in mind these considera tions, and if Persian government were in fact to show signs of any real desire to employ British officers to command these boats, you should encourage them to put forward detailed proposals. As regards the suggestion in Minister of Court’s letter of March 31ist that Persian cadets should he accepted for training in the British Navy, Admiralty would prefer that you should not raise this question.

The draft instructions now proposed to be sent to the Minister are, I suggest, generally suitable. It is definitely to our interest that, if possible, the Persian patrol vessels in the Gulf should be commanded by British officers or a British officer, and the probability of friction will be greatly increased by the introduction of nationals of another European Power in command. I submit that I might be authorised to write to Lord Monteagle as in the draft now submitted. The question of the training of Persian cadets in the Navy is entirely for the Admiralty.

WITH reference to my telegrams No. 74 and No. 75 of the 28th March. I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter from Teymourtache which reached me yesterday and in which he explains his views about the assistance he hopes to obtain from His Majesty's Government in the creation of a Persian navy. 2. In the course of my interview with him yesterday afternoon, his Highness referred to this matter. I at once explained to him that there could be no question of His Majesty’s Government presenting the Persian Government with any ships at all. This was precluded under the Washington Treaty. On the other hand, a rough estimate had been made of the cost of two sloops of about 700 tons and four motor- boats of 200 tons which, in the opinion of the senior naval officer in the Gulf, would be sufficient for the purposes of checking the contraband trade. According to this rough estimate the cost of these boats would be in the neighbourhood of £150,000, and His Majesty's Government, as a proof of their goodwill, were prepared to remit an additional amount of debt to cover the cost of these boats if the Persian Govern ment decided to order them in Great Britain. 3. His Highness said that this was not at all what he had anticipated when he first raised the question. He had expected His Majesty's Government to provide ten boats free of cost to the Persian Government as part compensation for the renuncia tion of the Persian claim to Bahrein. The Persian Government would never pay , any part of the debt, and it was useless to discuss the matter on the basis proposed. ( When his Highness, who had become very excited, finished this tirade, I begged him to consider the matter in a reasonable spirit. I should mention that he had already raised the question of the debt before speaking about the ships. I pointed out that the British Treasury had been very averse from waiving any part of the debt, and only after long discussions had His Majesty's Government eventually decided that, in order to arrive at a satisfactory all-round settlement, they would be prepared to waive a portion of the debt. One million pounds was a large sum of money. W hen he had raised the question of the ships last August he had brought in an entirely new point which really had no connexion with the treaty, but as a further proof of their goodwill His Majesty's Government had eventually agreed to assist the Persian Government in the only way they could by remitting an additional amount of debt and helping to find British officers to enter the service of the Persian Government if suitable terms could be arranged. 4. His Highness, however, did not disguise his disappointment; he had apparently worked himself up in the idea that there were so many ships in the British navy that we could easily afford to hand over a few to Persia. His attitude was, in fact, quite childish. As I realised it was no good continuing the conversa tion’, which had already lasted for several hours, I took my leave, and have arranged to go and see him again in a week’s time. 5. As you will see from his Highness’s letter, the Persian Government are now so far committed to the purchase of some boats in Italy that this would appear to all intents and purposes to be settled. Whether there is any point in proceeding with the question of British personnel for these ships or of the provision of British ships is for His Majesty’s Government to decide. It might possibly be worth while that Captain Boyes, the present senior naval officer in the Gulf, who, I understand, is relinquishing his command in June, should proceed to England by way of Tehran in case the Admiralty should wish to have the matter discussed with the Minister of Court by an experienced naval officer who was in Tehran last year and met his Highness on that occasion. 6. I venture to submit this suggestion for the consideration of the Admiralty. Captain Boyes could, at any rate, supply a much-needed antidote to the crazy idea which his Highness at present entertains on the subject of the future Persian navy. 1 should be grateful to receive your views by telegram.

HIRTZEL 8 APR 1930 Copy of to pojncAi Previous Papers :3997 k 2000 10.29 FOR INFORMATION The Minister of Court has entirely gone back on his suggestion (compare Tehran despatch No. 440 of 21st August, 1929, on P. 6152/29) that the ships contemplated in the Persian naval proposals should oe obtained from this country. He apparently now proposes buying the ships from Italy, antTpossibly having a British officer in command. Sir Robert Clive has protested vigorously, and the Foreign Office, I understand, propose to send a further stiffener to him on the subject. The decision is embarrassing, since it at once removed a possible item from the credit side of our negotiations, and complicates the situation sli^jntly as regards tne debt. It will be remembered that we are at present proposing to demand repayment of £500,000/* £500,000 worth of the debt, but were prepared to agree to abandon even this on condition that the orders for the ships desired by Persia were placed in this country. If the proposal for the purchase of ships falls through altogether, we shall be able to use the '500,000 in our general negotiations. It remains to be seen what the Admiralty will think about a Persian Navy manned by I tali an-trained Persian officers under the cornmand of a British officer, It mi^it not be an easy force to run, but it is very desirable from our point of view that the chief command should be in the hands of a British officer, and it might be worth stretching a point in order to secure this. ^ cV/sa. */h&lt;',csV&gt; ag mg fCH me , 10 A PL 19 hF[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official ase. c _ .

Yesterday I decided before proceeding to decision of more contentious articles to raise following question. I said that according to my information Persian Government had now practically arranged to purchase from Italy two 1,000 ton gain-boats end four motor- boats of about 200 tons and one of the Italian officers had left for Italy to discuss final details. I said that in view of request recorded in my despatch No. 440 of August 21st this seemed very surprising and I had no doubt that my Government would think it so especially as in my letter to him of January 24th I had in general terms returned a sym pathetic reply to his request. Minister professed to see nothing unusual in attitude of Persian Government. He said Persian Government might quite well obtain ships from one country and personnel from another. I said that it seemed to me absurd for the small requirements of a Persian Navy to apply to two different countries. I had quite clearly understood last August that he preferred to invoice the assistance of His Majesty’s Government ...Government. My Government had very carefully consider ed request and had authorised me to return a sympathetic answer. Minister then said that Italian Government had pressed him to have Persian naval officers trained in Italy as Persian military officers were trained in Prance. I enquired whether it was the v/ish of Persian Government that having purchased ships and had cadets trained in Italy commanding officers should he British. He said, why not? I replied that personally I doubted whether any British officers would accept service with Persian Government under such conditions. in any case in order to make the position clear to my Government as to v/hat His Highness had actually in mind I asked him to write me a letter. This he promised to do.

His Majesty’s Governraent have decided that, although there can he no Question of making any new financial concessions to Persia, other than those already approved, it is desircfole to endeavour in some way to meet the Minister of Court’s request for their assistance in the fomation. of a small fleet of Persian patrol vessels. The pre-requisite of any airangement must he a settlement of the pre-war debt, and it can only he by some further arrangement by which the ships shall he actually paid for by Persia that the Persian proposal can he met. You are authorised therefore at your discretion to begin by offering the Persian Government the remission of £1,000,000 of the agreed war and post-war debt, insisting on the repayment of the balance of £510,000. In the last resort, however, and in order to meet the difficulty of obtaining Persian ratification of any settlement providing for the repayment of any part of this debt, you may waive the remaining £510,000 of the war and post-war debt, on condition that Persia undertakes to purchase her naval requirements in British shipyards and to sign rn agreement for the supply from this country of the ships which she desires. Thisi &gt;**v 2 . arrangement presupposes a clear understanding that Persia v/iil purchase her naval requirements in British shipyards, and you will appreciate that such an 'under standing must be regarded as an essential condition of the settlement. His Majesty's Government realise, however, that the suggestion in the preceding paragraph may prove impracticable and that some other means of overcoming the financial difficulties may have to be devisea.

WITH reference to your cfespatch No. 440 of the 21st August, in which you reported a conversation with the Persian Minister of Court regarding the establishment of a Persian naval preventive service in the Persian Gulf, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum,* embodying the result of full discussion by the various Government Offices concerned. 2. I shall inform you by telegram of the eventual decision of His Majesty’s Government. I am, &amp;c. ARTHUR HENDERSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. NEGOTIATIONS have for some months been in progress for a general treaty settlement with Persia, as it is desirable that our relations with that country should be established on a satisfactory and permanent basis by the settlement as soon as possible of various difficult questions. 2. The present moment is a favourable one for such a settlement. Teymourtache, the Persian Minister of Court, is at present a powerful factor in the sphere of foreign relations, and possessing more experience of the outside world than most Persian statesmen, he is for that very reason a more astute negotiator. But he is also prepared to accept greater responsibility, and exercises greater personal influence with the Shah, than is likely to be the case with any successor. 3. As a part of the proposed settlement, we are asking Persia for facilities for our ships’ companies to land for recreation at Hen jam. We are asking her to renounce her claims (which we regard as without foundation) to certain Arabian islands in the Persian Gulf, and to repay the capital of her pre-war debt, on which she has hitherto paid only interest. These British requirements are reasonable, but, on paper, they mean a series of apparent concessions by Persia. In return for them we are prepared to offer certain important financial concessions (see para graph 12 below); but the negotiations may none the less be not easy, and any further concession, real or even apparent, which we can make on our side, would enable the Persian Government to save face—an important factor in all negotiations with an Eastern Power. 4. On the 20th August the Persian Minister of Court made an important suggestion to Sir R. Clive, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. He explained that Persia desired to develop her own control over the contraband trade, &amp;c., in the Persian Gulf, and wished to appeal to Great Britain for assistance in the form of a small fleet of armed patrol vessels (four of 1,000 and six of 200 tons). He added that what he, personally, would like would be for British naval officers to command these vessels, and for His Majesty's Government to accept a number of Persian cadets for training in England. Persia had been negotiating for the supply of such ships from Italy, and had, in fact, already sent twenty young Persians for training in an Italian naval school at Leghorn; but she would much prefer to obtain the assistance she needed from Great Britain, who alone, he explained, “ with her outstanding knowledge of the Persian Gulf, and the finest naval service in the world,’’ could effectively help Persia to put down the contraband trade in this area. 5. In putting forward this proposal, Teymourtache attempted to link it on to the entirely separate question of Bahrein. Persia recently revived an ancient claim to the ownership of the Arab islands of Bahrein, off the Arabian coast of the Gulf, with the independent rulers, of which His Majesty’s Government have been in special treaty relations for more than a century. Teymourtache has provisionally 5189 [20393]2 + o Mi agreed to abandon this claim in the general treaty now under negotiation, but still maintains that Persia is entitled to demand compensation for doing so. He has suggested that the ships referred to above should be supplied by His Majesty’s Government as a free gift, as a part of the return to be made for the abandonment of the claim to Bahrein. This cannot, of course, .be entertained, as Sir R. (dive at once pointed out. There could not well be any question of our making a particulauj^* concession to Persia as a specific return for her abandonment of her Bahrein elaiin^^ or of our supplying the ships as a free gift. 6. Two separate questions present themselves for consideration :— (a.) Is it desirable, on general political grounds, that His Majesty’s Government should make an effort to assist the Persian Government to obtain the patrol vessels from British sources, lend the officers, &amp;c. ? (6.) If so, can the financial difficulties, arising from the fact that a free gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question, be in any way surmounted ? 7. There are strong reasons for considering it desirable that, if the Persian Government really mean in some way or another to acquire these patrol vessels, they should be encouraged to obtain them from British sources. These reasons may be summarised as follows :— (a.) By meeting Teymourtache half-way in his present proposals, our position in the general negotiations will be strengthened, whereas a refusal to consider his proposals w-oidd be likely to render these negotiations even more difficult than they are at present. (6.) We should show that we were ready to co-operate with the Persians in their legitimate object of attempting themselves to police their waters, to control smuggling, and to fulfil their international responsibilities in connexion with the suppression of the arms traffic and the slave trade in the Persian Gulf. (c.) We should help the British shipbuilding trade. (e?.) If Persia obtains her ships from other sources, she will probably obtain from those same sources the officers to command the ships, if, on the other hand, she obtains her ships from British sources, it is likely (as is shown by Teymourtache’s personal suggestion mentioned in paragraph 4 above) that the ships will be commanded by British officers; and if the ships w r ere commanded by British officers :— (1.) The Persian preventive service would be better managed than if w r e did not co-operate in its development. Moreover, the ships, by enabling Persia to make some positive contribution to the control of the slave trade and the arms traffic, might to some extent relieve His Majesty’s ships of the liabilities which they at present discharge in those matters, owing to Persian inability to do so. (2.) From a different standpoint, the presence of British personnel should go far to reduce the danger of the employment of the Persian naval force, as might otherwise be the case, to harass the Arab chiefs on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, with whom His Majesty’s Government are in close treaty relations, or of its being allowed to act in an arbitrary or unjust manner. (3.) We should avoid risk of other European Powers obtaining a footing in the Gulf astride our air and sea communications with the East. 8. The local British authorities in the Gulf are strongly of opinion that it is preferable for Persia to acquire her naval patrol service under British auspices as a British training should give the Persian personnel a British outlook, and this tendency would be accentuated by the presence in the Gulf of His Majesty’s ships, which will act as a model. Such experience amongst the Persian personnel should go far to establish really good Anglo-Persian relations locally, whereas if the personnel were trained under Italian or other auspices, it is to be feared that not only the relations between Persians and British, but between Persians and Arabs and even between British and Arabs would inevitably be exacerbated. 9. The Government of India are similarly in favour of the proposal. They consider it desirable to keep Italy and other Powers out of the Gulf; and if this can only be done by our providing ships and personnel, they think that we should do so. ’ They suggest, however, that the Persian naval forces be kept as small as possible. 10. 1 provided t 11. r J difficulties the questic ^^his questii country. 12. 1 approxima in the neq Persian Pi of the debt years’ anni subject to £ for ratifica pre-war de debt contra the Persia] any part o troops wer incurred w spent prim war expem His Ma jest no treaty s&lt; provided fr in Decemlx to waive th outstanding be made fo: has been ps 13. 1 of 200 tons be put in t of the Gov&lt; possible sci sloops of 6 1 with the e capital cosi 14.

The Admiralty would be prepared to assist in finding British personnel, provided that the Persian Government offer suitable terms. 11. 1 he second question is whether it is possible to overcome the financial difficulties arising from the fact that a free gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question. But Sir R. Clive has suggested that this might be done by linking ^^his question on to that of the possible remission of part of the Persian debt to this country. 12. The total capital debt of Persia to this country and India amounts approximately to £3^ million; and, with accumulated interest, the amount would be in the neighbourhood of £5 million. As a result of negotiations with a former Persian Prime Minister, however, we offered in the year 1925 to reduce the total of the debt to the round sum of £2 million, to be paid off by means of a twenty-five years’ annuity, to start in 1926. This offer was accepted by the Persian Government subject to approval by the Majlis, but in fact has never been submitted to that body for ratification. Of the total £2 million a sum of £490,000 represents the Persian pre-war debt, on which interest has always been paid, and the remainder represents \ debt contracted during and since the war. As regards this latter part of the debt, the Persians are understood to contend that no obligation rests on them to repay any part of the debt contracted during and after the war at a time when British troops were occupying their country. They argue that the debts were illegally incurred without the sanction of the Persian Parliament, and that the money was spent primarily for the benefit of the Allies, and ought to be regarded as British war expenditure. This is a point of view which could not possibly be accepted by His Majesty’s Government; but as a matter of practical politics it is probable that no treatv settlement with this country would be accepted or ratified by Persia which provided for the repayment of the war or post-war debt. It was accordingly agreed in December 1928 that His Majesty’s Government would, if necessary, be prepared to waive this part of the debt in return for a satisfactory general settlement of other outstanding questions, and on the understanding that suitable arrangements would be made for the repayment of the capital of the pre-war debt, on which interest only has been paid till now. Nothing has as yet been said to the Persians on the subject. 13. The cost of the ships indicated by Teymourtache (four of 1,000 and six of 200 tons) would differ widely according to'the type selected, but may provisionally be put in the neighbourhood of £500.000. With a view to giving effect to the wish of the Government of India that the Persian naval forces should be on the smallest possible scale, the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf has submitted that two sloops of 600-700 tons and four motor-launches of 150-200 tons would be sufficient, with the existing customs motor dhows, to deal with the contraband trade. The capital cost of this proposal he estimates at roughly £140,000. 14. It has been suggested that Sir R. Clive should begin by offering the Persians the remission of £1 million only of the war and post-war debt, insisting on the repayment of the balance of £510,000. In the last resort, however, and in order to meet the difficulty, alluded to above, of obtaining Persian ratifications of any settlement providing for the repayment of any part of this debt, Sir R. Clive might be authorised to waive the last £510,000 of the war and post-war debt, on condition that Persia undertakes to purchase her naval requirements in British shipyards, and to sign an agreement for the supply of the ships which she desires from this country. This is, however, only a tentative suggestion which may prove impracticable, and some other means of overcoming the financial difficulty may have to be devised. 15. To sum up, it seems clearly desirable on general political grounds that His Majesty’s Government should make an effort to meet the request which has recently been put forward by the Persian Minister of Court for British assistance in the formation of a small fleet of Persian patrol vessels. It is realised, however, that there can be no question of making any further financial concessions to Persia; that the pre-requisite of any arrangement regarding the ships must be the settlement of the pre-war debt; and that it can therefore only be by some such arrangement as that suggested in the preceding paragraph, by which the ships should be actually paid for by Persia, that the Persian proposal could be met. It is therefore proposed to send to Sir R Clive general instructions on these lines, and to authorise him to oroceed as suggested in the preceding paragraph.j*UI AWAY WITH ^ ' O' ^ F0K3XGH OFfICS, S.W.l. / 10th January, 19^0. (3 i^6/i56/34) • Dear Lalthwaite, Mr. Henderson has now approved the drart memorandum regarding Teymourtache 1 s naval proposals, and it has been printed for early consideration by the Cabinet, The only alteration made in the amendments proposed by the various Departments concerned is that the first sentence of paragraph 3 has been omitted. It seemed unnecessary to have any sentence here explaining the main object of our present negotiations with Persia, when this point has already been dealt with in paragraph 1; and moreover, to be perfectly frank, the foreign Office cannot agree with the opinion of the Government of India, that ”so far from having little to offer Persia, 'we have everything, viz. our friendship, upon which her 'very existence depends'. I feel confident however that the India Office will agree with us that there is no need to confront the Cabinet with this conflict of views! J.G.

We should like however to suggest an addition at the end of paragraph 8 to the effect that the Admiralty would be prepared to assist in finding personnel, provided that the Persians offer suitaole terms.

Clive, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. Ho explained that Persia desired to develop her own control over the contraba nd trao &gt; etc. inthe Feraian Gulf, and wished to appeal to Great Britain for asaiat&amp;nce, in the forai of a email fleet of armed patrol reeaela (four of 1,000 and six of 800 tons). Ke added that what he. personally, woult like woulc be for British Haval ofiicors to command theee veesels, and for Hie Majesty's Goverir?»nt to accept a nmaber of ersian cadets for training in England. Persia had been negotiating for the supply of such ships from Italy, and had in fact already sent twenty young Persians for training in an Italian fifcnral school at Leghorn; but she would much prefer to obtain 1 lie assistance she needed from Great Britain, who alone, he explained. 'with her out standing knowledge of the Persian ’Gulf and the finest naval so. vice in the world', could effectively help Persia to put oown the contr&amp;b nd trade in this area* C. In putting forward this proposal, Tal mutt ache attempted to link it on to the entirely separate viuestion of Bahrein. Persia recently revived an ancient claim to the ownershipownership of the reb islxntie of B# nro in, off the /jrf.M&amp;n co^st of the a«lf t with the ‘ W\ , independent rulers of which His Majeaty 1 * rovernment hev© been in apoei&amp;l treaty relations for more than a century* faimurtache ha a proviaionally agreed to abandon this claim in the general trei ty now under negotiation, but still maintains that ?eraia ia entitled to demand compensation for coin*; ao* Xe ht^a auggeeted that the ahipa referred to tbove should be supplied by His aUi jesty• a Covorameat as a free gift, in j ~ A return for the abandonment of the claim to * Bahrein* xhis c* nnot of v*ourae be entertained, as ^ir xv* Olive at once pointed out. xhere could not well be any ^ueation of our making, a particular oonces ion to Bersi;. as a tpeoixio return for her abandonment of har Bahrein claim, or of our supply ing th® ahipa aa a free gift* 6* T o aepartite (iUestiono present theaaelvea for eonaideration# A.

B. If ao, can tha financial difficulties, arising from the fact that a free gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question, be in any y surmounted? 7, xhere are strong reasons for considering it desirable that, if the Persian Government really mean in some way or the other xo acquire these patrol vessels, they should be encouraged to obtain them from British sources* These reasons may be summarised as follows (a) By meeting Taimurtache half-wfc.y in his present proposals, our position in the general negotiations will be strengthened, whereas a refusal to consider his proposals would be likely to render these negotiations even more aiffieuit than they are ct present# (b) we should show that we were ready to co-operate with the lersians in their legitim te objectiabject of attempting themselves to police their wtters, to control araug ling, and to fulfil their international responsibilities in connexion with the suppression of the arias traffic and the slave trade in the Persian Gulf. (c) we should help the British ship building trade. (d) If Persia obtains her ships from other sources, she will probably obtain from * those same sources the officers to command the ships. If, on the other hand, she obtains her ships from British sources, it is lively (as is shown by Taimurtache 1 s uersonal suggestion mentioned in paragraph 4 shove) that the ships will be commanded by British officers; and if the ships were commanded by British officers: (I) The Persian preventive service would be better managed than if we did not oo-opartts in its development.^n d tho ships mii.ht prove of assistance in helping us to control ths Sob^KWx Morcov'ci’ ttic skip* By e ' ' va ^ th ^ &amp;r*C&amp; h&gt; vnjikc Some. po«Uwc UJntnboKow 1&amp;IM-* X* 7 cxfcvxt vdAtvc unlikely that the ships would be used M M, sUt^S of 1 tkc (iKbilituS WKi^ -they »f p«««&gt; -U': t', &lt;:. to IMMH «M &amp;1*cUa*j£€. itx tkot* MtAttc&lt;5 lo f^ 5ixM in^UVV • 11 j Td &gt;» /y p r#m k 1 ~ T&amp; * kkiofa on the Arabian coast of the £ulf # point, tu puttee* ej BriHoU fxYfoHHcl wiih whom His Majesty's Oovera^ient are in close •koolb 4 q far fe reduce o4 HvCiV ku'nj hg ci fu&lt;, t^floyhOMt t re&amp; xy relations, or.*# allowed to act in an of rttc Pcrti^t k^va) fovet A» Hu CMC &gt; fb K-Ma** . _ arbitrary or unjust liianner# (III4 iSfe should evoid risk of other luropean Powers obtainin. a footing in the Gulf astride our «ir and sea com/nunications with the iast. 3. xhe local British authorities in t he Gulf are strongly of opinion that it is preferable for Persia to acquire her naval patrol service under British auspices, as a British training should give the Persian personnel a British outlook, and this tendency would be accentuated by the presence in the Gulf of His Majesty's ohips, which will act as a model.such experience amongst the Persian personnel should go far to establish really , ood i-nglo-Porsia n relations locally, whereas if the personnel were trained under Italian or other ausp^icoo, it is to be feared that not only the relat ionsrelatione between i'eraians and britieh, but between Persians and Arabs v and even between riti^hand ..rabs would inevitably be exacerbated# xhe Government of Indi^ are similarly in favour of the proposal# They consider it desirable to keep Italy and other cowers out of the Gulf; and if this can only be done by our providing ships and personnel, they think that we should uo so# They suggest, however, that the Persian naval forces be kept as snail as possible# 10. The second question is whether it is possible to overcome the financial difficult ie arising; from the fact that a froe gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question air K. Olive has suggested that this might be done by linking this question on to that of the posoibl© remission of part of the Persian deb to this country. 11# It was agreed some years ago by a for «r Persian Prime Minister that the proportionproportion of the Persian de which Persia could reasonably be as.kad to repay was £2,000 t 0 0* Of this £490,000 represents the Pereiin pre-war debt, and £1,510,000 the war end post-war debt, i’here has never been any question of not insisting on the re-payaaent of the £490,000 pre-war debt. As regards the war and post-war debt, however, the position is unite different, ih© Persians are convinced that no obligation rests on thetfi to re-pay any part of the debt contracted during and after the war at t: tiiiie when British troops were occupying d « *‘4 uc A. th-3ir country; tney l.el that the debta were illegally incurred without the at net ion of the . eraian irterliuaent, and that the money was spent primarily for the benefit of the Allies and ought to be regarded as British war expenditure. It has long been clear that no treaty settlement with this country is likely to be accepted or ratified by Persia which provides for the re-payment of any portion of the Persian warwer or post-war debt* It was accorctin ly agreed In December 1928 that Hie Majesty's Govern .ent would be prepared to waive this debt of £1,510,0JO, in return for a satisfactory general settlement of outstanding questions, but nothing has yet been said to the Persians on the subject. 12, I’he cost of the ships indicated by Taimurtache (four of 1,000 and six of 200 tons) would probably be in the neighbour hood of £500,000. flith a view to giving effect to the wish of the Government of India that the Persian naval forces should be on tae smallest possible scale, the Senior Heval Officer in the Persian Gulf has submitted that two sloops of 600-700 tons and four motor- Uunebes of 150-200 tons would be sufficient, with the existing customs motor dhows, to deal with the contraband trade, ‘ihe capital cost of this proposal he estimates at rough ly £110 , Q JO • lo.±3.

In the last resort, however, and in order to meet the oif iculty, alluded to above, of obtaining Persian rat i fioet ion of any settlement providing for the re-p*yment of tny part of this debt, air H.- Olivo might bo authorised to vri ive the last ^510,000 oi the war and post-war debt, on rsjan s unoertook to spend In British shipyards and to sign an agreement or the supply of the ships which they ceaire from this country# This i nowever, only a tentative suggestion which may prove impracticable, and some other means of overcoming, the financial difficulty may here to bs devised. -14. To sum up, it seems clearly desirable y on general political grounds thet dia Majesty* Government should make an effort to meet the s requestrequest which has recently been put forward by the Persian Minister of’ Court for British asal' ce in the formation of a amall fleet of Persian patrol vessels. It is realized, however, that there can be no question of m&amp; lag any further financial concession to Persia; that the pre-requisite of any arrangement regarding the ships must be the settlement of the pre-war debt; and that it can therefore only be by some such arrangement as that suggested in the preceding paragraph, by which the ships should be actually paid for by Persia, that the Persian propoa 1 could be met.

In this conference the Foreign Office remarked that the effect of Sir Robert Clive’s proposal in paragraph 8 of his despatch, No. 44$, would be that Persia would have to pay to His Majesty’s Government not only £500,000 on account of the prewar debt, but a second £500,000 on account of the war and postwar debt. The Forei^i Office took the view that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to persuade the Persian Parliament to agree to any Treaty providing for the second payment on account of the war and postwar debt, but remarked that, even if this second £500,000 on account of the war and postwar debt were to be recovered from Persia, there would be obvious Treasury/Treasury and Parliamentary objection at this end to the employment of any part of the sum so recovered for the supply of warships to a foreign Government. They suggested, in these circumstances, that a possible solution might be to instruct Sir Robert Clive to tell the Persians in the first instance that His Majesty's Government could not waive more than £1,000,000 of the war debt, i.e., Sir Robert Clive would first insist on a proposal that Persia should pay not only the £500,000 prewar debt, but also £500,000 of the war and post war debt; but in the last resort, at a later stage in the negotiations, he might inform the Persians that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to renounce the balance of the war and postwar debt, i.e., the second £500,000, if Persia would guarantee to spend an equivalent sum in British shipyards, and sign an agreement for the supply by this country of the ships they desired. The result of this proposal would be that His Majesty's Government would not sacrifice any more than the sum which they had already agreed to abandon, but the Persians would get their—— I Draft Paper. POLITICAL Department. ships as part of the payment, and this might enable us to escape the :! Treasury and Parliamentary objection ! already referred to. The Treasury attitude was that there could be no question of making any further financial concession to Persia; that the pre requisite of any deal such as that suggested must be settlement of the prewar debt fon this point, of course, the India Office are in full agreement); and that it could therefore only be by some such arrangement as that suggested by the Foreign Office by which the ships, etc., should actually be paid for, that the Persian proposal could be met.

It will be seen from the minutes that the Admiralty, India Office and Foreign Office were in general agreement that, if there was to be a Persian naval force in the Gulf, it was better, on the whole, that it should be under British rather than Italian auspices. The Admiralty and the Foreign Office also agreed 'that our tentative view that the danger of complications with the Arab Protectorates was not an overwhelming obstacle, since complications which might be still more embarrassing would be likely to arise in the event of a force under foreign control. The Colonial Office, looking at the matter, as Ur. Hall said, exclusively from the narrow point of view of Iraq, strongly opposed any concession to Persia. As will be seen from the telegram on P. 6295, they have now consulted the Acting High Commissioner on the proposal generally. The Foreign Office mentioned that a copy of Sir Robert Clive's despatch was sent privately to Colonel Barrett, and it has gone officially to the Government of India. I submit that, in view of the iact that this question is^likely to be brought before the Cabinet &lt; and the Resident at once^ we might consuls the Government of India^indicatm/to them the tentative.

For one thing, it would certainly be much more satisfactory from our point of view that, if the Persians are going to have some sort of naval force in the Gulf, it should be under our auspices and not under those, e.g. , of the Italians. The chances of friction both with H.M. ships in the Gulf and with the Rulers of the Arab littoral would be very greatly reduced by the presence in command of British officers. 3. From quite a different standpoint, assistance of this nature to Persia might, in view of the great importance clearly attached by the Persian authorities to putting down smuggling, be a valuable bargaining lever. 4 As regards finance, I do not quite follow Sir Robert Clive’s proposal in paragraph 8 . Presumably it is that we should earmark £510,000 of the agreed debt for the supply of armed launches, remitting the remaining £ 1 , 000,000 in return for the general settlement, Bahrein, etc. r. The decision must very largely turn on the UL^ ^ f&amp;fi i, - /v _ i t. Admiralty report as to practicability, and as to the extent H _ wv.

The Secretary of State is of opinion that these proposals, which , in his opinion deserve serious and sympathetic attention, should in the first place be discussed by an inter-departmental committee with a view to the preparation of a report for consideration by the Cabinet. 3.

WITH reference to paragraphs 17 and 18 of my despatch No. 439 of the 21st August, I have the honour to record my conversation with the Minister of Court on the subject of his proposal that His Majesty’s Government should, as one of the conditions of Persia renouncing her claim to Bahrein, provide the Persian Government gratis with a number of small vessels (four of 1,000 tons and six of 200) in order to police her waters and deal with the contraband traffic. 2. I said that if, for the sake of argument, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to present Persia with ten vessels such as he proposed, how did the Persian Government propose to man these vessels ? So far as I was aware, not only could they not provide officers but they could not provide crews. While I did not profess to know anything about naval matters, I imagined that before a British officer was put in command of a gunboat of 1,000 tons he would have had to have some ten years’ service ; this added to five years’ training at a naval college would make fifteen years. Again, I asked what about the Italian gunboats which I understood had been ordered and the contracts which had been made with Italian naval officers ? His Highness said that the Italian gunboats had not yet been definitely ordered, and that there would be no difficulty about the Italian naval officers. Speaking personally [i.e., he had not submitted this to His Majesty or to the Council of Ministers), what he would like would be for British officers to command these vessels and for His Majesty’s Government to agree to train in England a number of young Persians so that in time they might be competent to take them over. I showed no enthusiasm for this proposal; instead, I pointed out some of the difficulties in the way. I said, for instance, that, so far as I understood, no British officers and no British crews were kept in a bad climate like the Persian Gulf for more than two years. The Persian Gulf was notoriously one of the worst climates in the world. Supposing, however, that British officers were allowed to volunteer for service in the Persian Gulf, they would almost certainly not be prepared to stay for more than two years and would quite certainly require a very much higher rate of pay than they would receive in the British navy. I added that I felt very doubtful whether any Persian could ever be trained as a naval officer. Practically the only Persians who had ever seen the sea or knew anything about it were the Persianised Arabs who lived on the Persian shore of the Gulf. It was no doubt possible that crews might eventually be trained from this element, but I could not see where the officers were to come from. It was notorious that Persians from the plateau when sent for service to Khuzistan or Persian Gulf ports at once complained of the damp heat and only counted the days until they could be relieved. 3. His Highness did not deny this, but said that about twenty young Persians were at present being trained at the Italian naval school at Leghorn. He refused to take such a pessimistic view of the possibility of eventually creating a small Persian marine service. 4. To return, however, to the question of British officers, he was convinced that Great Britain alone, with her outstanding knowledge of the Persian Gulf and the finest navy in the world, could help Persia in her difficulties in putting down the contraband trade. 5. He was prepared to recognise that Great Britain must always be the first Power in the Persian Gulf. Persia was content with second place, but she wished and intended to establish her right to that second place and to have her territorial waters respected. Persia fully recognised all that Great Britain had done in the Gulf, and that without our controlling hand Muscat, Koweit, &amp;c., would be infesting the Gulf with pirates, and that the traffic in arms and slaves would be general. He did not for a moment wish to contest our claim to control the southern shores of the Gulf. [911 c—2]2 At the same time he wished for the aid and assistance which we alone could give to Persia. O. I thanked him for this expression of confidence and, without holding out the slightest hope that his proposals would be favourably considered, said that I would refer them to you. 7. Now, putting aside the many practical difficulties in the way of meeti^A his Highness in this matter, I venture with the greatest diffidence to submit consideration the following suggestion :— 8. His Majesty’s Government, having reluctantly expressed their willingness, in return for a satisfactory all-round settlement, to forgo £1,510,000 of the agreed debt of £2,000,000, the latter might be reduced to £1,000,000, while out of ihe remaining £510,000 a small fleet of contraband chasers might be provided. The Admiralty would doubtless know the type of vessel most suitable for this purpose, and whether, supposing the objections to Taimourtache’s proposal were not insuperable, either British officers could be seconded for service under the Persian Government, or whether ex-British naval officers would be likely to volunteer for this service. 9. There is one objection which occurred to me but which I naturally did not mention to the Minister of Court. As His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have long-standing and intimate relations with the Arab sheikhs and chiefs on the southern shores of the Gulf, and as His Majesty’s ships constantly visit and maintain relations with these sheikhs, it might, it seems to me, be embarrassing should Persian vessels commanded by British officers in the course of their duties come into conflict with dhows belonging to these sheikhs and possibly capture them or cause loss of life. However, on this point the Government of India, the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the senior naval officer are far more competent to offer an opinion than I am. 10. Finally, it appears to me to be a question of policy for serious consideration as to whether it would be wise to adopt a completely non possumus attitude. On the one hand, the Persians are notoriously the most ungrateful of people for services rendered to them, and the fate of foreign missions to Persia in the past one hundred years provides a sorry story. On the other hand, might not a Persian naval preventive service under British command afford a possible solution of the slave trade question and render an agreement on the lines proposed by His Majesty’s Government unnecessary, while minimising the danger of accepting the Minister of Court’s counter proposal? Again, assuming that the relations between His Majesty’s ships and the Persian vessels under British officers would be of the most friendly description, might not this proposal tend to simplify other questions in the Gulf as between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government ? 11. I beg that you will understand that I am not recommending the proposal and that the above remarks are tentative and only submitted in order to assist a consideration of the question in all its bearings. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. August 24, 1929. P. S.—Since writing the above my attention was drawn to an article in the “ Shafagh-i-Surkh,” a Persian paper, whose editor, Dashti, has to my knowledge very intimate relations with the Minister of Court. I accordingly wrote a personal letter to his Highness enclosing this article, and this morning received his reply. I enclose copies of this correspondence, from which it will be seen that the Persian Government are definitely not pledged to purchase the Italian boats. R. H. C.Dear Laithwaite, Rendel has asked me to send you the enclosed copy of Clive’s despatch No. 440 of August 21, about Taimurtache’s ’’naval proposals”. He asks me to explain that there is a possibility of an interdepartmental conference being called in the near future, possibly on Friday, for a preliminary discussion of the questions raised in this despatch.

I HAVE the honour to report that during his stay in Tehran I arranged for Captain Boyes, senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf, to meet Commander del Prato, of the Italian Naval Mission. 2. Captain Boyes will no doubt report fully to the Admiralty, but I have thought it well to transmit to you a copy of the report which the military attache to this Legation has sent to the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at the War Office. 3. 1 also enclose a record of the conversation which Mr. Havard had with Major Dezan, another officer of the Italian Naval Mission. 4.

CLIVE / f 2 ^ No. 1. March 18, 1929 Section 14. / Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Major Woodward to Director of Military Operations, War Office. Memorandum. THE following information regarding proposed Persian naval forces has been gleaned from Commander del Prato by Captain Boyes, British senior naval officer, Persian Gulf:— Navy. Two vessels of 1,000 tons each, internal combustion engines, probably armed with two 4-inch guns and two machine guns. These vessels may also be used for surveying. Revenue Service. Four gunboats of 250 tons each, internal combustion engines ; armament, one 50-mm. gun and two machine guns. The above are being built in Italy, due to arrive in the Gulf middle of 1930. At Mohammerah. A floating dock to lift 2,000 tons. A floating workshop. A barrack and training school to take 200 men. Nine Persian officers are being trained in Italy and are to come to Persia at the end of 1930. A naval mission of Italian officers and petty officers is also to come to Persia. As the Persians know nothing whatever about naval matters, Prato is experiencing some difficulty in his dealings with them. The items in the current budget relative to the navy are :— For purchase of new and repair of old vessels and expenses in connexion with foieign naval officers, 400,000 tomans. There are two items “ credits for sending students to Europe ” under the military and general budgets respectively, but this money will have been earmarked already. Under the circumstances it appears an ambitious programme with the funds available, and will take some years to complete. R. F. WOODWARD, Major, Military Attache. Tehran, February 17, 1929.Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Minute by the Oriental Secretary. MAJOR DEZAN, one of the Italian naval mission, told me last night that he was very pessimistic as to the ability of the Persian Government to put a stop to the smuggling going on in the Gulf. He said he was sent down to Bushire to make a report, and he was told the matter was most urgent. He came back and submitted his report of the 15th January, and has since heard nothing further, and he thought he might hear nothing further for quite a long time. He told me that when he was in Bushire he enquired how much smuggled goods (sugar) had been captured during the last year; the total amount was 2,000 sacks, whereas the Government is supposed to be losing a revenue of 400 tomans a day. He thought that the means at the disposal of the Government for preventing this trade were quite inadequate, and one of the chief reasons he had for being despondent was that the smugglers and the crews of the preventive vessels were all friends, if not even relations; it was, therefore, difficult to expect the crews to do their very best for the Government at the expense of their friends, and, moreover, if they went too far they exposed themselves and their families to revenge. On the other hand, the Persians were not seamen and had not the means of manning these boats with any other material. G. T. HAVARD.
