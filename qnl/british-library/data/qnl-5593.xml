Sir John Simon proposes, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, to approve the suggestions put forward by Sir Reginald Hoare as to the attitude which he should adopt in the event of a complaint being received from the Persian Government on this subject.

As the dhow was a Persian one I do not see on what grounds the Persian Government could properly bring a complaint against the sheikh, who, considering the treatment that his own dhows have received from the Persian navy, might have been regarded as having done all that could be expected of him if he had simply released the two guard© and left them to find their own way home. 3# If the Persian Government were in the face of all decorum to complain either because the Hakhoda was not handed over to them or because the sheikh presumed to take his punishment into his own hands I should feel disposed, while explaining privately the undeservedly considerate treatment which they had received from His Excellency, to reply officially that so long as Persia does not recognise Kuwait the Persian Government can hardly expect the Sheikh to behave as though an extradition treaty existed* 4.

Sir, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of a despatch received from the Political Agent in Kuwait with its enclosure. 2. The two Persian Customs Guards referred to, in charge of a Non-Commissioned Officer of the Mohammerah Frontier Regiment, brought the despatch to me. The Guards also belong to this Regiment. They begged me to inform their Captain of the contents of Political Agent Kuwait’s letter. They stated that unless they could prove that they had been abducted to Kuwait they ran the risk of being shot for allowing the dhow to escape. 3 . I sent my interpreter, Mirza Abbas Parsi, to the Captain of the Frontier Regiment, as the latter is a personal friend, to explain the contents of Political Agent Kuwait’s letter. I told him not to give him a copy of the Nakhuda's statement as I feared this would do more harm than good to the cause of the two guards. The Captain of the Regiment did not appear to take the matter seriously and did not contemplate any trouble for the Guards as he said the case was quite clear. He asked, however, for a copy of Political Agent Kuwait’s letter to support the tale of the Guards. He was informed that he must approach me through the Governor of Mohammerah for anything of that nature and that I was only communicating the news I had received as a matter of friendliness, I do not contemplate any further development, but as the Captain of the Regiment stated that he would have to telegraph to Tehran that the guards had /been 1 His Majesty’s Consul for Khuzistan, AHWAZ.- 2 - 'been released, it may 'be possible that the Persian Government intended or intend making some representation, though as they do not recognise the Shaikh of Kuwait or our interests in Kuwait such a course would appear to 'be difficult. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 166) Political Agent, Kuwait (No. 167). I have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) F.C.L. CHAUNCY. Captain, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul.( /2 Copy of letter No. C-60 dated the 20th February 1934 frorn^ the Political Agent, Kuwait, to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Mohammerah. I have the honour to forward this by the hands of two Persian Customs guards who have arrived in Kuwait under the following circumstances. A small Persian Dhow crew 5 men, Nakhuda, Ahmed Bin Hussain, cleared from Fao some 20 days ago with a small cargo of rice. The boat proceeded to Bander Dilam instead of going to Fao. There according to the Hakhuda, the dhow was aground, and was boarded by the local Mudir of Customs who seized it and put the two policemen on board to guard the cargo (judged to be contraband). 3. When the tide came in and the dhow floated the Nakhuda fearing he said, for his life and cargo, quietly slipped his cable and set sail for Kuwait, bringing the Persian guards along with him as prisoners. 4. On arrival the Nakhuda reported the matter to the Customs Director who at once released the men and sent them to His Excellency the Sheikh. 5. His Excellency was upset at the incident and ordered the two Persian guards to be well treated, and given presents, and ■3- 5, returned by the steamer sailing for your port today (&amp;.&amp;.Baroda)&lt;&gt; 6 . His Excellency personally came and asked for this letter to you, saying that he had imprisoned the Nakhuda and had passed sentence of banishment of him and his boat from Kuwait for all time , that is to say, it would not be allowed to come and trade with Kuwait again, on peril of its being seized and confiscated. His Excellency said that he would have liked to send the Nakhuda a prisoner to Mohammerah also, but Arab ’’custom” (pUxi^A. would not allow of this being -sorrg' especially as the man had made ’’Dakhala” to him on arrival. 7. The policemen have had their arms returned to them2 loi.F.V.No. 24655 1886 M.3 St. Etienne. 2.M.95.

A translation of Nakhuda, Ahmed Bin Hussain’s statement to the Director of Customs at Kuwait is also enclosed for information of the Persian authorities. 9. I write this in haste as I desire to catch the up mail steamer now in port. Copy, with compliments, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, for information.&amp; Translation of a statement made by Nakhuda Ahmad Bin Hussain on the 5th Dhil Qa’dah 1352, equivalent to the 19th February, 1934. I, Nakhuda Ahmad Bin Hussain, left Kuwait for Fao on the 16th Shauwal 1352 (1.2.34) with a cargo of 23 bags of sugar as per manifest No. 697. During the Voyage we met a very strong wind, and were compelled to make for Dilam waters of Persia. God destined that our Balam should go aground, when the Director of Customs at Dilam, with two policemen came upon us, arrested us and started threatening us. Some of our crew escaped, and only three of us remained. The Director then confiscated some of our cargo, and left with us two men as guards. We, knowing that we should be beaten and suffer imprisonment, acted as anybody in our position would to act; we took'flight, and when our Balam floated on the high tide, we sailed with the two policemen on board. We have now come to Kuwait. We have not shown any harsh treatment to the said policemen.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000168_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3793</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000168</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3793</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/76 'Koweit: Abduction to Koweit of two Persian customs guards, by the crew of a Persian dhow.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-21T10:49:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (13 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 15; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the abduction from Dilam [Bandar-e Deylam] in Persia to Koweit [Kuwait] of two Persian customs guards by the crew of a Persian dhow.
