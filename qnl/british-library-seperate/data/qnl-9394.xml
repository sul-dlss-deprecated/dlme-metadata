However, as the Colonial Office attached little importance to papal awards, and the Foreign Office did not expect to be consulted by the Vatican on awards to those not in the service of the Crown, the British Government decided not to intervene in the matter. The text of the papal award (in Italian), dated 25 September 1939, appears on folios 13-14. There was greater concern among British officials about the decision of Shaikh Hamad to institute the order of the Al Khalifah (text of
                           alan, dated 7 February 1940, folio 29). The papers include a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior, to the India Office, dated 14 March 1940, describing interviews he had held with both Charles Dalrymple Belgrave (the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain), and Shaikh Hamad, at which he expressed his concerns about the new award (folios 21-24). To the India Office, Prior stated that he hoped the award would lapse.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretariat of State (Holy See)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Decorations of honour</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f1#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
