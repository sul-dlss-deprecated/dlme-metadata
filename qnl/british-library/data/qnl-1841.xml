Dear Peel, In your letter to Baggallay, No. P.Z. 4214/38 of the 21st June, you asked whether we had any suggestions to make about an alternative form of words to be used in the Consular Commissions of military officers of the Indian Political Service when posted to appointments in Persia. We agree that, whenever possible, it would be preferable to use the term 'a member of the Indian Political ’’Service' 1 instead of the term 'an officer in our Indian Army’J But in the rare cases when an officer is appointed who is not a member of the Political Service the position is more difficult, and I can only suggest that in such cases it may be best not to use any description at all. Yours sincerely, R.T. Peel, Esq. , M.C.'OREIGrN OFFICE, S. W. 1 16th June, 1938. (E 2887/461/34) Dear Peel, In your official letter No.P.%.2805/38 of the 20th May, regarding the designations to he shown on the passports of military officers of the Indian Political Service when posted to appointments in Persia, it was suggested that arrangements should he made for new passports to he issued free of charge to such officers who are posted to Persia while on leave in the United Kingdom. I am glad to say that arrangements are being made for this practice to he adopted in future. 2. Another difficulty which has arisen in this connexion is the description which is given of military members of the Indian political Service in their Consular Commissions. I enclose an extract from a letter from Butler at Tehran to Bland asking whether in future it may not he possible to come to some arrangement with the Government of India whereby such officers may he described ’Ui, 1 ’ .II Ihn rzo in ...

As a matter of fact all consular commissions are prepared here in the Foreign Office and we propose in future, subject to your observations and those of the Government of India, to do as Butler asks.(E 2887/461/34) Extract from letter from Mr. Butler (Tehran) dated the 21st April, 1938, to Sir N.

In this Commission, which of course was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an Exequatur, Falconer is described simply as ”a Major in Our Indian Army”, v/ith no reference at all to his being a member of the Political Service. This is doubtless the usual method of describing military members of the Political Service, but it does seem desirable to avoid, if we can, giving the Iranians evidence of this kind v/ith which to refute our case that these officers are no longer soldiers. I should be very grateful therefore if you could consider whether it would be possible to agree with the Government of India to describe military officers of the Indian Political Service in their Consular Commissions in some other way than as ’’Officers of Our Indian Army”.

His Majesty’s Legation apprehend that owing to recent developments the Iranian Government may take exception to such a passport in which a British Consular Officer in Iran is described as an 'Indian Army Officer', with or without any other designation, and they have therefore suggested that military officers of the Indian Political Service who are posted to Iran should be given new passports containing a more suitable designation. 2. . • . .2 The Government of India agree with the views of His Majesty’s Legation and are making arrangements for all military officers of the Indian Political Service when posted to Iran from India to obtain new passports in which they will be described as 'His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General ', 'His Britannic Majesty’s Consul ', or 'His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul ' as the case may be, from the Government of India in the JSxternal Affairs Department before proceeding to take up their duties• There still remains, however, the question of such officers who may be posted to Iran while on leave in the United Kingdom and whose passports cannot therefore be issued in India, I am to request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, such officers may be instructed to obtain new passports in the United Kingdom and to describe themselves in their passports in the manner indicated above. 3* In India Government servants are exempted from the payment of fees for passports which they may require for proceeding to a foreign country on duty.

We have not yet been able to extract agrdments for Falconer and Hickinbotham. Now that the Iranian Government have accepted Dredge, I do not think they can raise objections to the military rank of the other two; it is possible, however, that they may try to make diffi culties over Hickinbotham’s connection with Bahrein. They have not done this hitherto in previous cases, e.g. when Loch acted as Political Resident, but they are now upset by the two new Bahrein Laws on Nationality and Holding of Real Estate, and they may take it out of Hickinbotham. 3.

Dear Parsons, This is simply to warn you that there are signs of a recrudescence of the question of Consular appointments in the South. We have at present outstanding applications in respect of Dredge (Zahidan), Falconer (Kerman) and Kickinbotham (fiushire). In the case of Dredge the Iranian Government asked officially for a record of his services and I took the opportunity of handing our reoly, giving the information desired, to the Chef du Protocole (Noury Esfandiary) to try to forestall any objections, xhe general question has not been raised on the Iranian side, and I therefore made it clear that I was speaking entirely privately to him. I went through the system under which your officers for these posts are recruited, the great advantage ox filling trie posts from your service, and the other arguments with whicn you are familiar and which I need not repeat. Noury Ssfandiary himself understands the position quite well, and said he did not himself think there were any objections to the three appointees we had nut forward. He said, however, that while he hirnself fully realised the circumstances in which these officers held military rank and while he agreed that, so long as they did hold such rank we were right in describing them by it, this was the point that constantly caused difficulty. When/ The Honourable Lieut-Colonel A.S.B. Parsons, C.B.E., D.S.O., Government of India, NEW DELHI.When a new appointment is made he is, according to what he says, invariably asked why we want soldiers in these places, and has to explain the system of recruitment to the service etcetera. He said that if it were possible to appoint officers who had always held civilian posts, there would never be any difficulty at all. I gathered from what he said that the Shah had commented on the point. 2. So far as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is concerned, I think the position is clear and that they do not themselves want to make trouble over the present series of appointments. But of course they have little influence and they may be ordered to make trouble. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel, Garoe and Squire. (Sgd.) H. J. Seymour.1 T.z. Jfwsm.

Thank you for your confidential letter of the 17th May about the suggestion that Military officers of the Indian Political Service might drop their military titles while serving in Iran. 2. I fully appreciate the force of the objections which you raise to this suggestion and in the circumstances I agree that it is not worth pursuing. 3. The Protocol Department here has been hesvily engaged and constantly on the move with visiting Ministers of Foreign Affairs and it has not been possible to explain the position to the member of the Department who raised the point in January* But my Oriental Secretary recently spoke to another member of the Protocol Department, explaining that we thought that the proposed conspiracy of silence would rather result in a transparent fiction which could serve no useful purpose. We may well hear no more about it* 4. I am sending a copy of this letter, together with a copy of your letter of the 17th May, to Oliphant at the Foreign Office. (Signed) H. J. Seymour. Sir H.A.F. Metcalfe K. C. I. E. , C.S. I. ,M. V. 0. , Simla.-CONFIDENTIAL Personal Simla, The 17th May, 1937. My dear Seymour, I must apologise for not having answered before your letter No. 33/2/37 of the 9th January 1937, in which you suggested that it might be desirable for military officers of the Indian Political Service (this is our new title since the 1st April 1937) to drop their military titles while serving in Iran. I wished to discuss the matter with Fowle who visited Belhi in March and since then I have been so pre occupied with Waziristan and other worries that I am afraid that your letter was overlooked. 2. The suggestion of the Protocole Department was merely that the Legation in asking the Iranian Government for their agreement to a consular appointment should refer to the officer as 'Mr. X' instead of 'Major” or 'Captain' 'X'. Such a conspiracy of silence, intended to deceive the Foreign Minister at the time that Iranian agrement to Consular appointments was sought, would in our opinion inevitably lead to future embarrassment, since it would not be possible for the officers concerned to prevent their private correspon dents from addressing them in the style to which they knew them to be entitled. The Iranian postal service would see his letters and perhaps report the discrepancy to higher authority, in which case we should lay ourselves open to a charge of duplicity difficult to rebut. The Iranian Government might also urge that we had admitted the principle by our deception, so that theycould logically demand the exclusion of military officers from Consular appointments. /our H. J. Seymour Esquire C.M.G. , C.V.O. , His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran,Our conclusion therefore is that any scheme hased on temporary relinquishment of military titles during the period of employ ment in Iran would serve no useful purpose and might land us in further trouble with the Iranian Government. There is of course the alternative course of dropping all military titles throughout the service, which would automatically solve your difficulty. There are, many arguments against this and previous examinations of the question has resulted in nothing being done to disturb the existing position, is taken up afresh, I will see that your point given full consideration. If the question of view is Yours ever, (Sgd. ) Aubrey Metcalfe.P # Z.9327/35. CONFIDENTIAL. Extract from letter from Sir A. Metcalfe to Mr. Walton, dated 9th December 1935. a x X X (d) Employment of Officers of the For. &amp; Pol. Dept, at Consular posts in Iran. This note was also recorded by Hugessen after a discussion which had taken place v/ith the Viceroy. As you will see we have here also merely agreed to the Minister raising the question with the Foreign Office. There is a great deal in my opinion to be said on both sides. On the one hand there is, as you know, a strong feeling here headed by H.E. the Viceroy and supported both by official and public opinion that India ought not to contribute as she does at present to diplomatic and consular representation in a Foreign country. Public opinion also of course goes further and considers that, if India is to continue to pay, a proportion at any rate of the more important posts should be given to Indians, and that is a solution which would be definitely unacceptable to the Iranians. On the other hand, we here feel strongly that Members of the British Consular Service are not equipped either by training or by language qualifications to deal' with the difficulties that arise in Iran over Indian subjects resident in Iran. We think therefore that the substitution of British Consular Officers for Officers of Indian Services would result in a definite deterioration of conditions of life for Indian subjects in Iran, which are at present none too good. It would also result to a great extent in loss of knowledge here as to conditions in Persia which would re-act unfavourably on Indo-Iranian Trade and other relations. Hugesse^s suggestion that the Govt, of India should supply subordinate officers to work under Members of the British Consular Service does not seem to us at all practicable or desirable, though there might be no objection to a Member of the For. &amp; Pol. Dept, being included among the staff of H.M. f s Legation at Tehran.Copy to: Sir Lancelot Oliphant: f No. 55/2/27 PERSONAL. 9th January, 1937 You will doubtless remember that among the subjects discussed when Knatchbull-Hugessen and Loxley were in lifelhi was the question of the military rank of Foreign and Political Department officers serving as Consuls in Iran# A summary of the discussion is given in the last paragraph of the record of the discussions on the whole subject of the employment of officers of the Foreign and Political Department at Consular posts in Iran. I see that you were going to look further into the possibility of dropping the military titles of these officers. We do not seem to have heard any more about this suggestion until quite recently a member of the Protocole Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (which is the Department concerned) asked one of my staff whether it would be possible for us when asking the Iranian Government for their agrement to the appointment of a Consul who has military rank, to omit any mention of the military rank in our note. He said that the Head of his Department didn r t want to raise any difficulty over this point, but that our practice in writing 'Major X' etc., did make it a little awkward for the Department as there was the risk that the Minister for Foreign Affairs might raise objections if he caught sight of the military titles. Therefore in their replies the Protocole Department always wrote plain 'Mr. X'. It was suggested that we might do likewise. I don’t think there is any reason to see in these remarks the first sign of a new offensive against Foreign and/ .F. Metcalfe, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., M.V.O., New Delhi.and Political Consuls* It is simply a suggestion, made in a sensibly informed way by the Protocole Department, with whose members we are on the best of terms, for a conspiracy of silence between themselves and us, which should remove a possible cause of trouble in the future* There is no immediate need to reply to this suggestion, but I think tnat we shall have to say something about it eventually, I should therefore be most grateful for your comments - and for your help if you feel that you can give it. The conspiracy suggested is a little childish and still more unreal. Could you from the administrative point of view drop military titles in Iran, while tney are actually serving in this country without actually dropping these titles throughout the service? (The latter I imagine would be a big question involving many issues*) 4, I might add that if this concession of form is to be made, there might be worse times than the present for it. The difficult situation over the new Consul-General at Metjshed which Knatchbull-Hugessen foresaw was eased by your appointing a civilian, while the Persians on their side have made no difficulty over the appointment of military Foreign and Political consuls (Bazalgette and Fry). Indo-Persian relations have not been at all bad for the last year (Largely of course thanks to the patience of the Government of India) and there hove been no incidents for over a year (l touch wood hurriedlyl) Finally the Frotocole Department are at present particularly friendly and in this case have proceeded very sensibly, granted that they adhere to their dislike of military titles, as Hugessen felt certain that they would. So that if you are able to meet them I think it would be all to the good and the time not unpropitious* Will you let me know what you think about it? (signed) H. J. SeymourI Employment of officers of the Foreign &amp; Political Dept. at Consular posts in Iran. Note by Minister, Tehran. ,jpf ^ His Majesty’s Minister raised this question and suggested the desirability of all Consular posts in Persia hitherto filled from India being taken over by the Foreign Office and filled from H.M.’s Consular Service. He explained that although the objections raised in 1934 by the Iranian Government have not been persisted in and although all recent requests for the acceptance of nominees from India have been acquiesced in, he did not consider that the difficulty had been finally disposed of. Trouble was almost certain to revive when the time came for changes of H.M.’s Consuls General at Meshed and Bushire. Bushire would moreover be complicated by considerations of maintaining the Political Resident there, to which the Iranian Government had in the past objected. The present system no doubt contributed to the difficulties experienced by our Consular Officers in discharging their duties and, though H.M.'s Minister was far from wishing to suggest that a change should be made merely for the sake of pleasing the Iranian Government, he felt that a change was desirable and he knew that the Foreign Office were strongly in favour of it. He made the personal suggestion, subject to reference in due course to the Foreign Office that the best solution would be for the posts all to be filled from the Consular Service but for the posts concerned to have, where necessary in some subordinate capacity, an officer from the F. &lt;1 P. Dept, equipped with the expert knowledge of the Indian side of the work which was absolutely necessary at these posts. H.E. the Viceroy expressed himself in favour of this solution as it would relieve the Government ofIndia of the expense of their present contribution to the maintenance of these posts. H.E. had also suggested that the question of filling subordinate posts from the F. &amp; P. Dept, and of any necessary financial or other readjustments might with advantage be examined by a Committee.The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India pointed out certain objections to the suggested change. In the first place the Government of India might be reluctant to abandon posts which they had filled for a considerable time. This consideration might be partly sentimental and as such of no great weight but it also included the necessity, in the interests of the Government of India, of maintaining their influence and organisation in those parts of Iran in case of any collapse of the present regime. As to this it was felt, after discussion, that the main responsibility lay with H.M.G. through H.M. 1 s Minister at Tehran. A more important point was that the Government of India would expect to be relieved of their quota of the expenses of these posts and there v/as a danger that they would thus forfeit their right to be consulted as closely as at present on matters of policy affecting Persia. It was suggested that this last con sideration would be met if the Government of India continued to pay the salaries of the subordinate officers whose expert knowledge of local problems would still render them indispensable. It is also for consideration whether it would not be desirable for a member of the F. &amp; P. Dept, to be included in future among the staff of H.M.’s Legation at Tehran, v/here knowledge of Indian matters (which form so large a proportion of the daily work of the Legation) would be of great value. It was finally agreed that if the Government of India could be assured that they would be relieved of a substantial portion of theirjpresent financial contribution in the event of the proposed change being introduced, they would probably be prepared to agree, and that with this proviso H.M .*3 Minister might put his proposals before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It was thought that if any such change were to be introduced the present moment would be the most favourable as/ft as the introduction of the Constitutional Reforms in India would inevitably in time open the way to pressure from the Indian side &gt; or admission of Indians to Consular posts which, in viev/ of the attitude adopted by the Iranian Government in 1934, would threaten to create still further^ifficulty. H.M. f s Minister then raised a further point which he hoped coald be dealt with independently of the general question, namely, the military rank at present held by the Consuls from the P. &amp; p. Dept, in India. The objections to this from the Iranian point of viev/ v/ere well known and it certainly gave the impression that a nucleus military organisation was being kept up in Iran. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India explained the administrative reasons for which this arrangement existed but on further examination it appeared possible that the question of abolition of military titles for officials employed might be feasible. Mr. Metcalfe undertook to look further into the matter. Place on file. Action is required here on last paragraph. ( Sgd.)

Sir John Simon agrees that His Majesty's Minister should be instructed to seek the concurrence of the Persian Grovernment in this appointment without reopening the general question of the appointment of officers of the Foreign and Political Department as consular officers in Persia. But if the Persian Government themselves reopen the question, he would prefer that His Majesty's Minister should simply state that he must refer the matter to His Majesty's Government for further instructions.

'The Secretary to the Resident also ho las a conmission as- Consul* The Government of Tnaia propose to post Captain Woods- Ballard and invited, in accoraance with the normal, procedure, the concurrence of the Minister at Tehran before doing so* Mr* Knatchhull-Hugessen/was at the moment on duty in the Gulf asked that the matter should he left over until his return to Tehran ana suggested that in view of the difficulties which arose last autumn over the grant of exequaturs to Indian Political department Consuls he should accompany his request for the Persian Agrement to the appointment of Captain Woods-Ballard with '’verbal explanations of attitude of H.M.G. at the same time expressing strong hope that Persian Government on reflection have decided to modify their former point of view**. The compromise proposal made by the Government of India that Captain Woods-Ballard should be sent to Bushire as Secretary, endeavours being made subsequently to obtain Consular Agrement for him, was rejected by the Minister for reasons in which there is force. The question now for decision is what instructions are to be sent to Mr. Hugessen. 2. Mr. Hugessen has perhaps, not unnaturally, been inclined to be rather apprehensive over difficulty with the Persians over this question and gave the who* 2 / have discussed them informally with me. 3. one does not like to go against the opinion of the Minister who will, after all, have to handle the negotiations. On the other hand, one cannot help feeling that to take the line suggested in his telegrajn of 18th February would leave on the Persians the impression that we dia not feel real confidence in our case ana that when we took a very stiff line with their last September, which resulted in their withdrawing their objections to the appointment of Colonel Daly and Major Pyper, we were to some extent bluffing. I suggest that in these circumstances we might suggest the revised draft attached to the Foreign Office. The position is complicated by the fact that the Foreign Office would by no means regret the disappearance of all Indian Political Department Consuls from Persia and the taking over of this area by the Levant Consular Service, and they are therefore inclined to be rather lukewarm in defending this particular point, we are of course on quite good ground internationally (as we j made clear in the course of discussions last year)j to acquiesce in the Persian attitude on a point such as this could not but damage prestige; and while objections supported by evidence to an individual will always be considered, general objection to the employment of a whole category of officers cannot be entertained. 1 do not think there is really very much in the point taken in paragraph 1 of the Foreign Office draft, viz. that the Persian Government would not use this particular point as a test case unless they wished to raise and fight the Residency question. They have not for a long time shown any real interest in the re tention 0 f the Residency at Bushire - a point originally raised/ |3/ 3164 5000 10.34 correspondence ending with your letter of the 4th torch, No. £ 1377/1174/34, on the question of the tactics to he adopted in dealing with the Persians over the proposed appointment of an officer of th® Indian political Dept, as Secretary (and consul) at Bushire. 2* sir John Simon will he familiar (from the correspondence which passed with the Government of India and with this Office in the autumn of last year in connection with the difficulties raised hy the Persians over the grant of Exequaturs to Lt.Col. Daly and tojor 'Pyper^with the importance attached hy | the G.of I. (whose views are fully shared hy the s/s) to this question ' and it will he within his recollection that the Persian Government was given no encouragement to hope that objections of a general character if put forward hy them would he entertained, and that they finally (while indicating orally that they maintained their view) withdrew their objection to the grant of exequaturs to the two officers whose case was under consideration. i3. The 3/3 agrees with Mr. Knatchbull- Hugessen that the issue if praised is one which must he faced and he sees no objection to treating the present case, as proposed by the Minister, as a test case. But while he feaLs-eome diffidonco in differing from the course of action suggested by the Minister, by whom the actual negotiation will, of course, have to be handled, he is strongly of opinion that the course suggested in the penultimate paragraph of Tehran telegram No.58 of 18th February would be calculated to leave the Persians with an impression that H.M.G. felt themselves on weak ground and that the very strongly worded representations made on their behalf both to the Persian Minister in London and at Tehran last autumn need not be taken too seriously. He would suggest in these circumstances for sir John Simon's consideration that the instructions to the Minister might be in the terms of the alternative draft now enclosed. f (SdL) J. C.

Sir Samuel Hoare will observe that the assertions of M. Sineki are completely at variance with the statements made to the Persian Minister and recorded in the despatch of the 31st October to Sir Reginald Hoare mentioned above.

As a result, 0 the Persian Government had agreed to the two appointments which bad raised the discussion. 2. Mr. Childs asked me if this was true, and I thought it better to enlighten him by saying that the truth was exactly the contrary to what Sineki had said, and that ’we had told the Persians that they would be wise not to raise the question again. 3. I suppose Kazemi has had this tale put round the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to save his face. It is quite possible that he has told the Shah the same tale. . 4. Mr. Childs asked me to keep Sineki’s name confidential in this matter. Smeki had only mentioned the matter in the course of a conversation about Sir John Malcolm’s memoirs, in which the question of the rivalry between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India during the 19th century had cropped up. 5.

How that X have taken over trom Loch - should like to taw this opportunity of putting on record ay views as to the dacand of the Persian Government that in future -ritiex: Consular Officers in Persia should not be drawn from the Foreign and i olixical i)epartaen , t • 2 . IB brief, ay views are that the Persian demand is impertinent rubbish, and I was very *lad to see the Government of India in their telegram of 1st ucW-er were apparently of the same general view. 3 , *uite apart from the consideration that an objection by a Government to a particular filaag of consular officer, as opposed to individual officers, must be un precedented in the annals of Diplomacy, What makes the Persian demand all the more ridiculous and indefensible is the fact that the relatione between foreign and oliUcal Department Consular Officers in Persia and local rersxa:. authorities, the only Persian authorities with whom come in contact, have been excellent. There we xour consular districts in l srsia held by such officers: Bueiiir*! »joh«Ka«rah f K«man and ;*sh«d* j, .. .. * 4 . With regard to -.usairc« noth »y predecessor s (Biscoe's), and my own, relations witi: a succession of Persian Governors have been unifomly friendly, and as far as / ‘‘‘kra^A.i .Metcalfe,C •^; I ;»^*J,^^ut*’ foreign Secretary to the ^ v *n®eut K#w JeXhi*as la permittad. by their regulations which they receive from their Government in Tehran* I have found these officials help ful. In some cases they have even stretched a point in my favour, of which 1 will give a case in point. In the beginning of i.933, when I had to proceed to .jrigland urgently on duty, there was no time for Loch, who was to act for me, to get his visa from the Persian Consuls either at Basrah or Karachi. I approached the Governor on the auhject, not unnaturally expecting difficulties, especially in view of the fact that Loch would have to come from Bahrain . The Governor, however, came willingly to my assistance and said that he would waive the matter of a visa and allow Loch to coiue in as a friend 1 Loch himself, while acting for me here, in August had a most amiable conversation at Tehran with the Persian minister Designate to London, * Irsa Hussein Khan ^la. ^ven the .ereian Customs who have a horrid reputation for obstruction, treat me kindly, and when I landed here the other day with s*y Jfcaily on return from leave, in spite of the fact that we had between us quite a lot of baggage, passed it all through without inspection. This was an act of courtesy, as a Consular Officer is not entitled to the privilege of exemption from Customs. The day before yesterday Hemphill flew through on his way to India. Ac he was in a hurry to get on I asked the Governor informally if it would be possible lor him to request the local officers on the aerodrome to do what they could to speed Hemphill’s departure, and to wire in the same sense to Jask. The Governor was only too pleased to do the necessary, and Hemphill Informed me that the lee 1 officials /officials here were most irieiidl^ obliging* *• hmv* taken the opportunity to write a personal letter of thanks to the Governor, passing on Semphill^ remarks. 11 these are only small things, but they are indications of local amic?;ble relations* With regard to Chuuncy, tne Vice consul there, in a situation of consiaerable delicacy, has been so successful in promoting good relaUons between the local iersian authorities and the British interests concerned, especially between the British and Persian Navies, that when j the Government of India proposed in the ordinary course of routine that ^hauncy should return to India this autumn, Hoare made a special request, ‘w'nich as far as I was concerned naa my entire backing, that Chauncy should be kept on. With regard to &gt; arman . Lincoln nas rccc vc_ excellent relations with tlie Governor General. With regard to ^eahed . ^ This is outside my area, but I am sure th&amp;t Daly has preserved the same ^ooa relations between h^self and the local ; ersian authorities which have existed in the other three Consular districts. The com-la-nt , ; of the i ersian Govcrimaent against -aly, as pointed out in paragraph 6 of foreign Office telegr ia of 4th October, is ridiculously trivial and was not made until IE mouths after the alleged incident.

L ^• i.o VL O Jt, Similar letter sent to 14 —6130 10292 (2)Ho« 456 British Legation, Tehran* 17th October, 19S4. copy of the note which, in accordance with Sir, i 5 I have the honour to transmi instructions conveyed in your telegram No, d06 of October 4th, I handed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (the prime Minister being absent in connection with the Firdausi celebrations) on October 10th on the subject of the refusal of exequaturs to Major Daly and Major pyper. 2. In the course of a long conversation it gradually emerged that Mirza All Khan Suheili was under the impression that hie chief had already mentioned to me the desire of the Persian Government that officers from the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India should, in future, not be appointed to Consulates in Persia, He finally understood that Kazemi had never mentioned the subject to me and, naving realised that, he quite realised too that the refusal of exequaturs was not at all a happy opening gambit, 3, His Excellency said that he thought the Council of Ministers would grant exequaturs to Major Laly and Major Pyper if he could convey an assurance from me that His Majesty’s Government accepted the principle that in future all our Consuls would be selected from the Consular Service, I told him quite definitely that I could give no such assurance and that if the exequaturs /were The Right honourable Sir John Simon, G,0.3,1,, © tc,, e tc,, e tc., The Foreign Office,were refused, the refusal, if baaed on that principle and not on definite personal objections, wou?*d be greatly resented and His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to resume trie treaty negotiations* If the Persian Government insisted on their ’principle’ ay instructions were to state that I was not authorised to discuss it but to refer to you for instructions. 4 . Suheili’s reply was to the effect that to grant the exequaturs unconditionally would be an unconditional surrender* 5 , I think that X more or less convinced him that this was quite a wrong view, saying that what the Persian Government had done was to demand, without discussion and even without notice, a change in a long standing procedure; neither he nor I knew in any detail what had been said by you, Sir R. Vansittart and Kazeai on the subject of the treaty negotiations; to my mind, therefore, the only reasonable course was to give the exequaturs out of hand; then, on Kaasemi’s arrival here, the Persian Government could make up their mind whether they believed that the treaty negotiations were likely to be brought to fruition, in which case the question of Consular representation must be left in abeyance; if, after reviewing the whole position in consultation with Kazemi, the Government reached the conclusion that the prospects of reaching a general settlement were negligible, there was nothing to prevent them, if they thought it worth while, marshalling their arguments and inviting His Majesty’s Government to accept their ’principle’ for the | future. The issue could then be properly discussed and if His Majesty's Government refused to admit the validity of the arguments advanced by the Persian Government the latter eould then decide, when we next had occasion to ask /for- « - (/©V) for an exequatur on Ijehalf of an officer from India, whether or not to provoke a crisis of a grave nature by a refusal* g, I then repeated that if the Persian Government pressed their point of view now I was not authorised to discuss it, but would have to state that His Majesty^ Government were not prepared to resume the treaty negotiations and that I should in due course convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the views of my Government. 7 # My impression was that Suheili was genuinely surprised to learn that Kazemi had never broached the question to me and that he realised that a bad blunder had been committed. At the same time he made it clear that when the Persian Government reached their present j decision 'some/time ago' the main factor was the question of prestige, and I therefore anticipate that, though they may grant the two exequaturs now in question, they will not be prepared to drop the matter. 8 # When the Prime Minister returns from Meshed I shall seek an interview with him and endeavour to enlist his support, but I shall be surprised if I elicit anything less useless than an expression of his hopes that our respective Governments will some day reach an understanding* 9 , I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India (Ho. 206), to the Acting Poetical Resident in the Persian Gulf (Ho. 172), and to the Acting Consul-General for Khorasan at . eunea (No. 73)• I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) R, H. Hoare*j^nciosure in Tehran despatch No* 4fi6 of the 17th tjetober, 1954, From His Majesty's Minister to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. No. 665 of the 8 th October, 1934. (Handed by His Majesty's Minister to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs personally on the 10th October, 1934). Monsieur le Glrant, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I duly communicated to His Majesty’s principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the contents of your note No. 22346 of Mehr 4th (September 26th, 1934) on the subject of the proposed appointment of Major Jaly and Major Pyper as Consul-General in Khorasan and Vice-Consul at Sabul respectively. 2. In the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom the undisputed right of any Cover ament to refuse to accept particular individuals as Consuls can only be properly exercised in very exceptional cases, where strong and definite reasons for that refusal can be given. The view of His Majesty’s Government is therefore that if, as in the present case, no a&amp;equpte reasons are given, while the refusal is maintained, a gross act of discourtesy would be committed. Moreover, the discourtesy would be aggravated by the fact that in the case of both Major Haly and Major Pyper my request for the exequaturs of the Imperial Government has been in your hands for a considerable time and that I have more than once pressed for a reply. 5 . I am, therefore, instructed to urge Your KxeeXleney to obtain a re-consideration of these two requests for an exequatur and to express the earnest hope that I shall receive a favourable reply at the earliest possible date. I avail myself of this opportunity, etc., etc. (Signed) R. H. Hoare.o • 466 British Legation, w i -r 5 NOV 1934 Tehran, October ^oth, 1934. Sir, In cojiti mation of my des mtch o. ^56 of October 17th I have the honour to transmit herewith tranelation of the note from the Acting :iii;ister for Foreign Affairs in which, as reported in ray telegram Ko. 143 of October 18th he has informed me that exequaturs v/ill be granted to Major Bely and Major Pyper. 2. hen handing me thia note Monsieur : uheili said that while it was realised that the procedure ado|t ed by the Persian Government rendered it impossible for them to maintain their refusal of exequaturs in the case of the two officers concerned they were not prepared to abandon their view that in future all Consuls appointed to Persia should be selected from the Consular service I replied that I very much hoped that the matter would be dropped altogether. His Excellency then made come remark Oil the subject of more important matters including the K Treaty negotiations which rather suggested that the Persian Government will ^ot press their point of view if the negotiations are resumed. 3. I told him that it was not very clear to rae why the negotiations had not been resumed after my audience in The Right Honourable Sir John pi on etc., etc#, etc., The Foreign Office.~ i d' m in December and enquired whether in the interests of ^ood relations it would not he possible to exercise a restraining influence on other Departments which produced mischievous stories such as that about British intrigues with Baluchi tribesmen. These stories reached the Shah arid seemed to make him forget that he was convinced of the sincerity of our policy and they did infinite harm. His excellency seemed quite to agree and assured rue that his Department success fully suppressed about eighty per ee t of the fables which were produced by the military authorities but he indicated that in some cases it was not possible to do so lest they subsequently reach His Majesty through some other channel, but he personally always did his best to prevent credence being attached to foolish stories. 4. To return to the Persian note. I admit that it is not an entirely satisfactory reply to our representation, but It w&amp;s not to be expected that the ersian novernment would withdraw completely and I suggest that it be left unanswered, especially as Sir H* Va sit tart has ni’de it abundantly clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the only prudent course for the Persian Gover sent to follow is to drop the matter. As X as leaving Persia in the near future, I should perhaps place on record the fact that I mentioned administrative difficulties as an argument to convince onsieur Gttheili that the attempt to confront us with a fait aocorapli was particularly outrageous* His reference toto my statement rather suggests that I allowed him to think that hut for administrative difficulties His Majesty 1 s Government might possibly have been ready to comply with the Persian request. This was certainly not the case. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, have been sent to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India {I*©• 211), to His Majesty*s Consul-General at Bushire (iio.175) and to the Acting British Consul-General for Khoraean (Be.fi).

While the Foreign Office state that Ala was given no encouragement to hope for any change in the existing procedure, and that they emphasised that the Persian demarche has made t}ie achievement of Persian desiderata in this matter even more difficult than before, it v/ould have/have iDeen preferable from our point of view that no hope should have been held out to Ala that we should in any circumstances be prepared to discuss the retention of officers of the Political Department in Persia. But there were no doubt tactical objections to adopting too positive an attitude: we have, at any rate for the time being, won our point: and the remarks made to Ala are unlikely to have done much harm. One of our difficulties is that, so far as can be judged, from the informal discussions that have taken place, the Eastern Department would regard the elimination of the Indian Political element (save possibly in posts of quite minor importance) from Persia with equanimity; and would not be seriously deterred by the additional financial burden which^Foreign Office would have to assume if the Welby arrangement came to an end. ^ Z4 ,&lt;1' L &lt; SEEN L ' I I • POLITICAL COMMITTEE, ^A^...V If n any further communication on this subject, please quote No.^ and address —not to any person by narfie, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

I should therefore much prefer to avoid any detailed discussion of qualifications of Indian Political Officers as such for consular posts in Persia, and to deal with present question as far as possible as isolated issue of Persian action in refusing exequaturs to two officers now concerned® Fact that Persian Government have selected so unfortunate a moment for taking this initiative and have put themselves so much in the wrong over particular test cases they have chosen to take up? should greatly strengthen our hands in taking this line® 5. Unless therefore you see strong objection to this course you should reply to Persian note on following lines® His Majesty's Government do not deny the right to any foreign country to refuse to receive particular individuals as consular officers, but maintain that this right can only properly be exercised in very exceptional cases and on the strongest ground; being shown® In the present case the refusal of the Persian Government to grant exequaturs to the two officers now in question is not only grossly discourteous in vievr of the long delay which has occurred in replying to your repeated reminders but appears to be supported by no evidence in justification of the&amp;&gt; the Persian contention that these officers are unsuitable« As the complaint against Lieutenant Colonel Paly apart irom its essential triviality - has not been made until 18 months after the event, and as Major Pyper has not served in Persia before, His Majesty’s Government must insist on the Persian objections to these two officers if maintained being supported by the strongest possible evidence, and in the mean time must ask that provisional recognition be accorded to themo 60 If on receipt of this note Feroughi either orally or in writing adopts or reiterates objections to officers from Political Department put forward by Acting Chief of Protocol, you should reply that an attempt to object to a whole category of consular officers raises a matter of such importance, both in substance and as evidence of attitude of Persian Government, that you must refer home for instructions and cannot enter int* any discussion of itc You should further add that pie of such a question would be quite incompatible with any resumption of treaty negotiations&gt; Repeated to India No*49© 'rod y* &gt; *IUOU OFFIGS, T.H lEHALL, % 1 1 .Z.61D5/34. tita October iJ34 by as&amp;r asorfee.

Please see Foreign Office telegram of 1st October to Tehran (repeated to India) regarding the discussions between the Foreign Office ana Kazemi, which sets out in some uetail the attituae aaoptea by the Foreign Office as regards the Persian suggestion that Political Department officers should not in future be employed in Persia. _ 2. The attitude to be adopted iir-ihii ■. nr Do r'cj-i m n r u i ^ con siuered at an infomai meeting at trie Foreign Office last night at which tne minister Designate to Tehran was present. 3. As a resuit, the telegram attached was drafted. It seems definitely preferable to endeavour to deal with the refusal of Exequaturs (about which alone we have had anything in writing from the Persians^ by itself ana to endeavour to ride the Persians off the major issue of tne suitability of officers of the Foreign ana Political Department for employment in Persia. As will be seen from the draft, it is proposes to instruct the minister, in the event of tne Persians reverting to the major issue, to inform them that having regard to the importance of the matter he must refer home for instructions ana cannot enter into any | discussion of it. He is also to make it clear that I the pressing of such a question will be quite incompatible with any resumption of treaty negotiations. This will leave our hanus free to consider in greater detail the general attitude to be adopted towardsPersia in the event oi the aeiLana heint pressea, ana in particular the possibility of retaliatory action on the lines suggested hy the Governiiient of Inaia. I doubt from the tone of the discussion last night whether there is any hope of persuading the Poreign Ofiice to include in the present telegram any reference to retaliatory action, but as the draft as it stands leaves tnis question entirely open we need not pernaps press it on the Foreign Office. Subject to the two drafting alterations referred to in the attached letter to Lr. Henoel, I submit that we may concur in the draft. I also attach a draft telegram to the Government of India. The Foreign Office telegram of 1st October to Tehran, No♦103, flagged below, has been repeated to them, ana tney will have seen from this that the Foreign Office n have taken a firm stand against the Persian suggestions in regard to the Political Department. But as tne Government of India clearly feel strongly on tnis subject and are very closely affected by the decision, p a telegram on the lines of the draft attached would perhaps be desirable? Colonel Daly is at present in Lonuon and is proposing to leave for Persia by car in the next few days. He has been informed privately that difficulty has arisen over his Exequatur, but the Foreign Office at last night's meeting agreed tnat it would be very undesirable to postpone his departure for meshed, even if, as a result of the difficulties which nave arisen with Persia, his position there might be rather awicwarc for some time after his arrival and his Exequatur might ultimately be refused. nu 3- c® ^ ^ oM t 6L ^ /fetid£■ '*4.fi4-s) ^800 5000 5.34 Draft Paper.

Hoare (Tehran), Foreign Office, 1st October, 1954. 9.30 p.m. No, 103. (R)« Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs recently announced his intention of paying two days' visit to London from September 28th, It was pointed out to him by Persian Minister that as Seutember 29th was Saturday, it w r ould be difficult to arrange meetings or discussions and he was informed that I myself should be unable to receive him owing to a previous engagement, but date could apparently not be altered. Persian Minister gave luncheon in his honour on September 29th, and Mr. Eden entertained him to lunch with Persian Minister and Sir R. Vansittart immediately before his departure on September 30th. Suitable facilities w r ere arranged for his journey and I sent representative to meet him and see him off. 2. In course of various conversations with Sir R. Vansittart and Mr. Rendel Kazemi's attention was drawn to difficulty of resinning negotiations for general settlement while incidents such as those at Tamb continued and Persian Government insisted on raising in so inopportune and discourteous a manner questions such as that of refusal of exequaturs to British consular officers of the Indian political service (see your [&gt;(*1 telegram No. 128 (of September 27th) to which reply will be sent as soon as possible)« Sir R. Vansittart emphasised inadmissible character of apparent Persian objection to whole category of officials as consular officers. Objections to individuals were another matter, but even then could only be justified on strongest possible grounds. If right to object to individuals were2. ©) y/ere not restrict?d to most exceptional cases only or were ^ not used very sparingly situation would resemble protracted conflicts of rival counsel over empanelling of an American jury. Indian Political Officers were particularly well qualified to look after interests of large Indian colonies in eastern and Southern Persia, and His Majesty’s Government must retain complete freedom to appoint whatever officers they consider most suitable for type of work involved. 3. Opportunity was also taken to explain to Fazemi complete freedom of British press and folly of attributing any importance to utterances of irresponsible journalists. While Anglo-Persian relations v;ere at the mercy on the one hand of Persian hyper-sensitiveness in cases of this kind and on the other to misjudged activities of Persian Navy in the Gulf and ill-timed initiative of Persian Government in such cases as that of recent arbitrary refusal of exequaturs to British consular officers all efforts to bring about any real improvement in Anglo-Persian relations were doomed to failure. 4. Finally Sir R. Vansittart assured Kazemi that Mis Majesty's Government admired and sympathised with the work of reconstruction which was being done in Persia; and well understood Persia's desire to be treated as a full gro-/.n power; but that it was also Persia's part to behave as such, instead of wasting her energies in pressing and attempting to jump shadowy claims to islands in the Persian Gulf which were of no concern to her, or launching offensive and unjustified attacks on His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia. 5. Kazemi made no further allusion to proposal for resumption of treaty negotiations. Addressed to Tehran No. 105, repeated to India No. 40.Draft Paper. Dfi^T l^TT^ . The Hon’hle Ivir. H.A.P. Metcalfe, C3I., CIS., MVO. / / / 4 OCT 1934 In continuation of uy private telegram No dated IsMUt I enclose copy of the note recorded hy Fowle about tne Persian request for the withdrawal of the Foreign and Political Department from Persia, which speaks for itself. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J. 0. TV ALTON.Mr. Walton r. With reference to the Persian Government’s demand that no officers of the Foreign and Political Department, Government of India, should be sent to Persia, on the ground that such officers are inclined to treat Persians as a subject race. 2. There are only three consular areas in Persia under P. &amp; P. officers - (a) Bushire, (b) Mohammerah, and (c) Meshed-Seistan. With rega rd to (al,both my predecessor 1 .^ Sir Hugh Biscoe’s, and my own relations^, with a succession of local Governors have been uniformly of the most friendly nature^and in various small ways, as far as their chauvinistic instructions from Tehran permit, I have found the local officials most obliging. I will quote one instance. When I had to come home hurriedly on duty at the beginning of last year there was no time for Colonel Loch, who was to act for me, to get his passport visaed by the Persian Consul at Basra. I approached the local Governor informally on the subject, na^u^a-t-y anticipating considerable difficulties especially as Colonel Loch would have to come from Bahrein. The Governor/2. Governor, however, came most willingly to my rescue and said he would waive the formality of a visa and let Colonel Loch land as a friend.* I doubt very much whether such a courtesy would have been extended in many European countries. Moreover, Colonel Loch, who is at present acting for me, when recently on a visit to Tehran, had a most amicable interview with Hussein Ala (the new Prime Minister to London)* rcgard to (b) . Captain Chauncy, the consular officer at &lt;/Y\- . Mohammerah, ta^woricing unceasingly to promote _riendly relations between the local Persian authorities and the various British interests concerned, notably between our Sloops and the Persian Navy. In fact nis efforts, in the most difficult circumstances^have been so successful that when the Government of India proposed in the ordinary course of routine transferring him to India, Sir Reginald Hoare made a special request, in which I heartily concurred as far as I was concerned and which the Government of India agreed to, that Captain Chauncy should remain at his post. With regard to (c) . I know nothing about Meshed-Seistan, which is outside my area, but I am sure that Colonel Daly has maintained in his consular district the same friendly/friendly relations with the Persian authorities as have existed at Bushire and Hohammerah. 3. In these circumstances the demand of the Persian Government seems to me not only rubbish, but most CL insolent rubbish at that. 2ife Government has the right to object to a particular foreign official serving in their country as being persona non .grata, but to object to a whole class of officials is, I imagine, unprecedented. The reasons why the Persian Government have made this extraordinary demand are, I imagine, two-fold - firstly their general policy of making themselves objectionable to H.M.G. whenever opportunity offers, and secondly as a counterblast to our protest over Tamb, which they must have known was coming to them in one form or another. 4. 1 assume, of course, that the Persian demand will be refused, but 1 venture to suggest that our reply should be worded in the strongest possible terms, and that the points in paragraph 2 above be brought to the notice of the Persian Government, naturally only in general terms, no mention being made of the Governor 1 s courtesy in regard to Colonel Loch f s passport, which would/would probably land the Governor in trouble. Further, I think we might well insist on the Persian Government giving chapter and verse of the instances which have induced them to make their impertinent request. 5. The above are my own personal views, but I think that the Government of India will probably concur in their general tenor. a w T.c, t tenor.Not&lt;&amp;. Minute Paper. Register No. P. SECRET.

Colonel Daly is an officer of the Political Department whcjwas due shortly to rejoin his appointment as Consul-General, keshed. Lajor pyper is an officer of the Inaian medical service who is apparently serving in Persia as keaical Officer attached to the Consulate General. The question of the issue of an Exequatur may have arisen through his being required temporarily to fill a consular post. 3. In 1929 the Persian Government took exception to trie appointment of officers with/&gt;v 2 . with military titles to consular posts in Persia; wnile it appeared for some time that they might he intending to challenge the employment in Persia of officers of the Foreign and Political Department in any consular capacity. The question was not pursued, hut tne Foreign Office, in a H despatch of 13th February 1930 (P.1235/30 flaggea / on the file helow) to the Minister at Tehran, clearly explained the international position in a question such as this, emphasized that the Political Department was essentially a civil and not a military service, and that the military ranks held hy its members were entirely lacking in any present military significance, and instructed the Minister to use such further arguments as he thought best to ensure . that if the unreasonable requirement that all consular officers should belong to regular diplomatic or consular services was admitted on our side, the Persian Government on their side should at least admit the perfectly reasonable interpretation that officers of the Indian Political Department should be regarded as such a service. 4. In 1931, consequent on the display by colonel Noel of the Political Department,, then Consul at Keriran, of a degree of active interest in the improvement of the countryside within his consular area which perhaps afforded some excuse for Persian suspicions, his recall was askea for by the Persian Government (compare Tehran despatch 153 of 1931, on P.2659/31 flagged). While H.k.G. did not agree that the Persian Government had any right to demand Colonel Noe1 1 s recall, arrangements were made for his transfer to a post in the North West Frontier Province. JV£LC-- (in November 1933, when the Foreign Office informed us, in connection with discussions about the removal of the x'iesidency, that wi-rtte the Persians could, if they wished to endeavour to prevent the Consul General at Bushire from being the same person as the Resident, “exercise their right to refuse the issue of an Exequatur to any individual nominee without giving any reason, W it/Minute Paper. Department. (0 3. it would...be very drastic to block all our appointments to the post of Consul-General in this way.. .Y/e should certainly have grounds for raising strong objection to such a proceeding, and could, if tne question was remitted to some third party, put up • an arguable case that it was unreasonable of the Persians to ooject to one oi our consular officers performing other duties outside Persia'. 6. The Foreign Office are disposed directlyto connect the present Persian request with Colonel Loch’s conversation with Ala reported on P.2.5905/54 flagged below, in the course of which the Acting Resident * appears to mave made statements consistent with a comparison between Persia ana Afghanistan or an Indian State, or a comparison of Persian nationalism with |Indian nationalism, and to have explained the method ol recruitment, etc. of the Political Department. But one is inclined to doubt whether there is much in this, cin^. it seems more likely that Colonel Daly’s remarks to the present Minister oi the Interior (harmless as they may have been) have afforded the Persian Government, vvho are passing through a stage of acute sensitiveness to any suggestion of inferiority, an excuse for reviving their suggestions of 1929. I understand that the question was discussed on Saturday and Sunday by sir Robert Vansittart and i.r. Rend el with K^zemi, the Persian L.F.a. , and with iila, the new Linister in London. Kazerni said he knew nothing about it. Ala, in an interview on Sunday, indicated that the Persian Government strongly d ejected to having in their country officers 'tarred Adth u&gt;rd curzon's brush' 1 , who, Quite involuntar/ no 2621 6000 3 34 doubt/ «4. dou'ot, were inclined to deal with Persia as they mighj with an Indian State. Both sir R. Vansittart and Mr. xtenael took: the line with the Persians that wnile Persia would he quite entitled to object to the postiijg of a particular officer for good reasons shorn, there would he the strongest ohjection to any attempt to take exception to a whole ca tegory of officers such as the Foreign aid Political Department. 7. A separate submission will he made in due course on the question of the instructions to he sent to Sir R. Hoare. The soundest line seems to he to take our stand on what appears to he undoubtedly our right, and to intimate to the Persians that while we should he prepared to consider representations in respect of individual officers if Supported by adequaie evidence, we cannot agree to the exclusion of a whole category. The Foreign Office in informal discussion have shorn signs of being anxious to meet tne Persian^ if possible on this point, though perhaps at some future date, though they recognise that any diminution in Indian representation in Persia would, other objections apart, raise the question of tne welhy Agreement; make any concession to Persia over the present question is a very strong one ana there is obvious force in the arguments brought forward by the Government of Inaia (though their suggestion for retaliatory action will require closer examination, ana though we must, I fear, leave trie handling of this/b. Minute Paper. Department. this matter to the Foreign Office ana the Linister at Tehran). Detailed comment on ana examination of the arguments on both sines of the question, is, however, postponed pending the submission of araft t instructions. It goes without sqy ing that a request &lt; t • such as the present is singularly ill-timed if there c ' • is any substance in recent Persian professions of their anxiety for friendly relations and an early resumption of treaty negotiations. © » • l (N^T^t4 OL fartz 'U- ^ *t 1. The present Persian d emarche is likely to be far more troablesome than the suggestion thrown out in Teymoartache 1 s letter of 20th August, 1929 (which was not t t pursued) that the appointment of military officers to consular posts was unusual and raised a question requiring to be settled. The Persian action need not be regarded as directly connected with our Tamb protest, since it was taken on 26th September, before anything had been said to the Persians about Tamb. Its motive must be sought in . the supersensitive nationalism so well described in Lr. Byron’s recent article m the “Times', and is, as Col. Fowle suggests, all of a piece with Persia's general policy of making herself objectionable. But the fact that the Persian Govt. ( viz .. no doubt, the Shah) has chosen this particular moment for voicing this objection may be/ 2621 f.000 3 31I be connected with Iggsr professed desire to resame treaty negotiations; the creation of a new desideratam would, if treaty negotiations were resumed, shift their basis even more in Persia's favour. One thing, therefore, at least seems clear - viz .. that we should, as the G. of I suggest in para. 4 of their telegram, firmly refuse to reopen treaty negotiations in this atmosphere. 2. The other action to be taken, in rejly to the Persian demand is a question of some difficulty. If Persia persists in her demand that H.M.G. should cease to send Indian Political officers as consuls, my own feeling i that we should be prepared to take retaliatory action of th kind proposed by the G. of I. The demand is, indeed, so inadmissible that it is a question whether we should not also be prepared in the last resort to withdraw our Minister (an action which the F.O. have contemplated before in other connections), and, within limits, suspend diplomati and consular relations. It is very possible, however, that a threat of the action suggested by the G. of I. would suffice, since, so far as Persia and India alone are concerned, it may be that Persia's trade interests stand to suffer more than ours from such limited action. 3. I fear, however, that there are weighty considerations against authorising the G. of I. to take the action suggested in para. 3 of their telegram of the F.O. and the Legation at Tehran, though, if we can persuade the F.O. to take such action, there would be no harm in authorising'the G. of I. to use similar language to the Persian Consul-General simu1tan eous1y. The considerations I have in mind are, in the first place, that, if such action were taken at Delhi alone, this would tend to confirm the Persian Govt.'s view that there is somethin unique and peculiar about the Indian Political De P^ reas /Minute Paper. Department. whereas in any argument with the Persians our attitude * would have to be that the officers of that Dept., holding as they do proper consular commissions, are entitled to be * regarded as proper consuls cl£ carriere just as much as * officers of the Levant Service. The second consideration is that this is a first class political question between Persia and H.M.G., and that we have hitherto taken the view that, even under India's forthcoming constitution, and a fortiori under the present one, important diplomatic questions must be dealt with through the diplomatic channel, and that conditions are not ripe for the G. of I. to take diplomatic action on their own account. There is therefore a constitutional argument of some little weight against making a precedent for independent 1 • • • action by the G. of I. 4. These difficulties are weighty, though they may not necessarily be conclusive. In a way it is rather a t pity that we cannot authorise the G. of !• to go ahead at once themselves with the action they propose, because t we must anticipate considerable difficulty in persuading the F.O. to take similar action with an adequate degree c i of firmness. Apart from their somewhat excessive regard for Persian susceptibilities, the F.O. may not be } altogether uninfluenced by the subconscious reflection I that the Persian demand runs parallel to some extent with their own attitude in the longstanding controversy between them and the G. of I. regarding consular expenditure and representation in Persia; it will be remembered that in 1924 the F.O. proposed that they^should ultimately man all I the Persian posts except Bushire; it is true that it was ■ ' also part of their proposal that they should receive a 2956 6000 7 34 1 contribution/contribution of £50,000 a year from India; but it is possible that they may be more desirous of securing the posts than the contribution, especially as, under the present financial arrangements, it is H.M.G. which has to make a contribution (of about year) to the expenditure incurred on India’s account. 5. It may therefore be necessary to put some pressure on the F.O. to ensure really strong action if Persia persists in her demand. 6. As regards the immediate action to be taken, it will be observed that Sir R. Hoare has received two intimations from the Persian Govt. - (1) a note refusing' exequaturs for Major Daly and Major Pyper, and (2) an fl ja ,l request that H.M.G. should cease to send Indian Political officers as con nsuls to Persia.^/&amp;ur best programme may be ~ as follows:- (i) to inform the Persian Prime Minister, as suggested by Sir R. Hoare, that the refusal of exequaturs is a gross discourtesy, aggravated by delay; (ii) if, in answer to this, Feroughi develops the Persian point of viev; on the general question, to intimate that a general objection to a whole category of officers is entirely inadmissible, taking our stand on th|e point that Persia has no right to object to the sources from which we draw properly commissioned consuls. It is suggested that such intimation should not be accompared by too much explanation of the politicals, though, if the point arises, it might be stated that officers of the Indian Politicaj. Dept, serving in Persia are entitled to be regarded as members of a regular consular service (see para. 4 ofMinute Paper.

First it appears to us that the point at which India’s annual contribution m n r&gt;nmp fixed at £50 000 would be unlikely to be reached for mamy years, rm^tha^the^MS^that we should receive in the meantime would not be great. A letid index to what extent the hopes of savings bmh up on a transfer of Consu- A useful index t Levant establishment are likely to be fulfilled, would be furnished bj the savings that have accrued from the transfer that has taken place at Ahwaz during the past year. _ , ^ppondlv even with an eventual contribution of £50,000 India would appa- rentlv be wing little short of half the total expenditure and for the reasons eve We prevLSy put forward, we consider that this would be unfair to her Thirdly if all Consulates were to be manned by officers of the Levant service we ourselves would lose that small amount of control that we still exert and consider ratable that we should exert, in areas where India has special interests. Fourthly though we have no doubt that officers of the Levant service would , At ^ w endeavours adequately to represent India s interests in Persia, it is bend tteir best be equipped with that knowledge of Indian languages obvious ~ Xch only prolonged residence in India can give, and which perhaps our Indian traders and communities in Persia would only value at its proper worth when actually deprived of the great assistance such knowledge affords. MC547FDFifthly, and this is an objection that has perceptibly gathered force since last we addressed you on the subject, we should find it increasingly difficult to justify to am already sensitive public opinion, Consular and Diplomatic expenditure in Persia without representation. Political India is now actively critical of Indian contribu- ticns towards the upkeep not only in Persia but elsewhere, of appointments held by members of the Diplomatic service from which Indians are at present under rule apecifically debarred, and of Consular appointments in which Indians are very sparsely represented indeed. Well-informed Indians recognise, it is true, that India has special and highly important interests in some at any rate of the areas in question. But while this is to them some justification for India’s participation in His Majesty’s Government’s Consular and Diplomatic expenditure, in which no other members of the Empire have a share, it is for them not unnaturally an argument for the expansion and not the contraction of Indian participation in the personnel. From this point of view the substitution of officers of the Levant Consular Service in the appointments that still are manned by officers of the Indian Political Depart ment, would be a retrograde measure which would focus hostile attention, certainly in India, and also to judge from recent questions in the House of Commons perhaps \ in certain quarters in England, on the apparent anomaly of India alone of the component parts of the Empire contributing towards His Majesty’s Government’s Consular and Diplomatic expenditure. 4. These reasons induce us to commend once again to His Majesty’s Govern ment the proposal made in our despatch No. 5 of 1922 for a division on a territorial basis. We would wish to man with our own officers Meshed, Sistan ^ Duzdap, Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Kerman, and to assume the whole responsibility for ordinary Diplomatic and Consular expenditure on these posts with the exception of Bushire. Of similar expenditure at Bushire and Tehran we are prepared to meet one-third. 5. If such a territorial division were made it would be possible for both sides to make economies in their establishments, and the motive for economy would be stronger. We have already been considering the possibility of reducing the cost of our Consular escorts and medical establishments and hope that we shall succeed in doing so. ( . 6. We are even prepared, if an immediate decision is reached on these lines, to waive our claim for retrospective adjustment. 7. Finally, we feel constrained to request that pending final decision steps may be taken forthwith to relieve India of the liability on account of the extra charge of £11,500 referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr. Wakely’s letter No. P. 2293, dated the 22nd May 1924 which India has had to pay all these years owing to a mis calculation.

Subject to your approval I propose to see the Prime Minister and tell him that refusal to grant exequaturs is regarded by you as gross discourtesy aggravated if possible by delay in informing me in spite of reminders. This will presumably lead His Excellency to enunciate views of Persian Government. I would reply that had Persian Government broached this proposal in a courteous manner instead of treating us with discourtesy of which I had just complained I should have sought to convince them that idea was a bad one explaining that principal reason why we have officers from foreign and political department in mast and South Persia is because practically all British subjects numbering about 5,.600 are British Indians; from their education al standing and occupations they were somewhat more liable than other foreigners to get involved in small ditiiculties with local authorities; if Consul were not a man with knowledge of Indian mentality it was probable that serious incidents would frequently develop out of minor matters and these incidents would inevitably react on general relations; if PersianCn^ 2 . Persian Government would give us some indication of what their object was we should he happy to inform all Consuls appointed from India of susceptibilities of the Persian Government* But action of Persian Government in refusing exequaturs would ? if persisted in render all friendly discussion impossible and His Majesty's Government would be compelled to regard it as unpleasantly definite evidence of their determination to force a quarrel.

After a few courtesies, he opened the subject of our relatione with Persia, saying how important it was that there should be friendly relations and that it seemed that British officials in the oouth had perhaps not fully realised the changes which had taken place in the last few years and that it was necessary to cultivate a spirit of frendliness, I replied that it was clear that a stable Persia with a good administration was (to put it on its lowest basis-that of | our own interests) most important to us* that I was sure | that we in the South perfectly appreciated the changed ;; conditions and, indeed, that our experience of the growth of I 1 v : a similar national feeling in India ana the Indian States | (though naturally in very different circumstances) enabled us 1. to understand and sympathise with such developments, I then took the opportunity of say tag that we were placed in a difficult position. The only person who was allowed to speak to me at all was the Governor and that X did not see much even of him and that I should like, for example, when the Senior Naval Officer (or any of our sloops) visited Bushire and a Persian warship was there also, to be able freely to ask the Captain and officers of the Persian ship to meet them, either at dinner or for &amp; game of tennis. He said that this isolation was due to the old days when the various@) - 2 - Tarious Legations and Con&amp;ul&amp;tos Lad got hold of Persian officials to work for them. I »aid that 1 could quite understand their adopting this course in the earlier days of the new rdgime* but that it was a pity to continue it now that things had settled down. 5. At one point in the conversations Mirza Hussein Ala gave me an opportunity of enquiring for what reason they had stopped the General Treaty Negotiations. He said that they had been exaraining the Treaty further and found that some of the clauses arranged by x&amp;imurtache were not suitable. He thought that the negotiations would need to be carried out starting afresh. 1 did not think it within my province to initiate a general discussion of the Treaty by asking what clauses were thought unsuitable, but I think from remarks which he made ©where that those about Bahrain and the Gulf Islands were among them. 4. He said later that one of the questions which needed to be settled was that of the islands in the Persian Gulf and Bahrain. I agreed that a settlement was desirable, but did not enter into a discussion. At one point he asked me if I was not from Bahrain, and I admitted that X came from that 'nameless place'• He had evidently, from the general tenour of his conversation, been studying uulf problems closely, and among other points mentioned (following almost immediately on a reference to the Persian Levy) Lord Clarendon's state ment of 1^69 • 5. At another point he gave me an opportunity of saying that I thought that their very high customs were, like those of •Iraq *That Great Britain would gladly, if it were possible, divest herself in favour of Persia of the duties of the prevention of pifacy and of the slave trade and the maintenance of the polic ing of the Gulf. See Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 896. / i :•Iraq , defeating their own ends. He asked If I really thought the duties too hlgh t and I said that consumers thought many of the Indian duties too high, but that the Persian duties were far higher still. I added that naturally some duties were of an industry-protecting naptre and so perhaps on a special basis and mentioned in this connection the cotton yarn factory at Shiraz, which X was able truthfully to praise. 6. He, Mirsa Hussein Ala was a little puzzled by my military rank and 1 told him briefly of the method of recruitment to the Political Department of the Government of India.l&lt;3f Notes.

Therefore, owing to the presence, beside the Consul- GeneralGeneral in Butshire, of a Consul and a Vice-Conaul, the recognition of Mr, (Captain) Bradshaw as British consul in Buehire under the superintendence of the British Consul- General Yr'ould not ho compatible with the above procedure* I avail myself of this opportunity* etc** (Cigned) Feroughl*Co;xy of rn^liah text* British Legation Tehran* 6th Jarmiury t 19iiX* Uonsieur le Hlnietre X have the honour to acijno . ledge the receipt of Your Hi^|aie&amp;e Y note i&lt;o* L£&gt;a64 of the 4th Dey lah regarding the appointment of Captain Emir haw aa His sleety* e Conaul at Bus hi re • Z.

In this connection I venture to draw the attention of Your Hidmess to the fact that in different parts of the world there are British consular officers of the same posts tinder the direction of senior consular officers and that they are all recognised by the Government of the country in which they are serving. 4.

W ^^&gt;1 ^ Letter from His Majesty s Consul General and Political Resident in the // Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 122/1930 of 1930 dated the 21st August 1930. ’ I have the honour to inform you that the Governor of Bandar Abbas has re- SjJ fused to recognise the signature of the Head Clerk of the Consulate there in the ' ‘ absence of His Majesty’s Consul, and has referred the matter to Tehran. The question arose over a report of the arrival of one of H. M. Ships, when the Governor returned the letter containing the usual intimation. The Acting Governor of the Gulf Ports was asked whether it was correct for the Governor of Bandar Abbas to refer to Tehran direct and if not whether he had received any communication from him. It was suggested that this was a matter which could be settled between him and myself without the trouble and delay of referring to Tehran. It was pointed out that it had always been the practice in the past, when the Consul went on this annual recess to Karachi for his Head Clerk to sign routine papess for him, and. chat no objection had ever been made to this by the Persian authorities. The Acting Governor replied that the Governor of Bandar Abbas should cer tainly have referred such matters to him but he had received no communication On the subject* He promised to make enquiries. In the meantime he suggested that the Consul should write a letter to the Governor of Bandar Abbas requesting that the Head Clerk’s signature should be accepted in his absence. His Majesty’s Consul was accordingly instructed to do this. The Acting Governor now informs me that the Governor of Bandar Abbas had in fact reported the matter to Tehran as the Ministry of Foreign Adairs has taken exception to the practice last year. He had admonished the Governor of Bandar Abbas for not referring to him, but since the matter had already been reported to Tehran it could not now be settled here and he suggested that I should refer it to you for settlement with the Persian Government. I would request, therefore, that, if you see no objection, the Persian Govern ment should be asked to issue instructions telegraphically that the signature of the Head Clerk, signing on behalf of His Majesty’s Consul should be acc&lt;TpNi*L during the absence of the Consul on recess in the future as it has been in the past. I may mention that Mr. Richardson took his Head Clerk with him when he went to say good-bye to the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas and introduced him to the latter. It would have been simple for the Deputy Governor to have discussed the matter on that occasion with Mr. Richardson, and informed him that he had received instructions not to accept the Head Clerk’s signature : Mr. Richardson could then have referred the matter before he left. He however did not do so.(4) Lorries are often seriously overloaded and driven at excessive speeds over bad roads, with the result that they are often seriously damaged and at times abandoned by the roadside. For such damage the military authorities refuse to accept responsibility, and state that it is covered by the rate paid for the hire of the lorry. ( 5 ) Transport is often detained idle by the military for several days, and no compensation is paid for such delays. ( 6 ) No discrimination is used by the commandeering officer, so that often all the transport of one owner is taken and none of another owner. 2 . Your Highness will agree that such unrestrained and irresponsible re quisitioning gives rise to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. In all countries the ‘ necessity of issuing some form of official receipt, whereby the owner may be assured of receiving his proper hire, is recognised. Ihe refusal of the military authori ties to recognise their responsibility for exceptional damage caused to commandeer ed lorries is also opposed to international practice. It is evident that the forcible requisitioning- of a lorry cannot be compared to an ordinary hire transaction, and serious damage sustained by a lorry (whose driver is often replaced by a mili tary chauffeur) in such circumstances cannot be regarded as fair wear-and-tear. 3 . The right of any Government to requisition transport in times of crisis is not disputed, although it is, I understand, customary to issue a public notification of the state of emergency which exists; but it is essential that requisitioning should be carried out in such a manner as to cause the minimum of loss and hardship to transport owners. I have therefore the honour to lay before your Highness certain proposals which would help to ensure that any commandeering that may be neces sary in the future will be carried out in the most equitable way. ( 1 ) A fair scale of hire should be drawn up and adhered to. ( 2 ) This scale should provide for the payment of hire for every day that the transport, though not actually employed on the road, is detained by the military authorities. t jr uw v^uvyj. i/xiv? ixxrcrxxT^^TCt v caij- Jr xxLHIj. ti/i-L cx v Lchv-/-H- Ixv/ilX either flank, 10 . The Russian G, P.

Continual artillery fire can be heard from Bilasuar in the Kara Dagh opposite the above districts ; and this has, perhaps, given rise to a rumour here that the Russians have raided Bilasuar. 12. Practically all the hostages taken have been released. Perhaps a dozen persons have been definitely carried off, including one or two of the Russians’ own spies who had been suspected of double-dealing ; and some minor refugee notables. 13. The general is pushing forward the disarmament and arrest of refugees in the Kara Dagh ; and having them sent here. 14.

Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 29th August, 1930 Sir, With reference to your letter No. P 361/30 of February 11th, relative to the procedure adopted by the Persian Government in connexion with the recognition of British Consular Officers, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran. 2. Sir R. Olive points out, in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this despatch, that while the Persian Government do not insist that all Consular Officers in Persia shall belong to a regular diplomatic or consular service, they do unquestionably place such a restriction on the appointment of acting Consular Officers. He considers that even this stipulation is highly objectionable and will probably in practice cause serious inconvenience to His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India. He therefore requests instructions in regard to the action which he should adopt towards this question, and suggests that he might inform the Persian Government that, if they insist on this unreasonable stipulation regarding acting Consuls, His Majesty*s Government may, in their turn, be forced to reconsider the acceptability of those substantive Persian representatives in British territory who are not de carriers . 3. The Secretary of State does not consider it desirable to approach. he Under-Secretary of State,approach the Persian Government on the lines proposed, - a course which would involve threatening them, not with reciprocity, hut with a much more far-reaching measure of reprisal. Such a threat might he met with a still more far- reaching counter-threat from the Persian Government, and it appears to him that on the v/hole. His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of India stand to lose more than they are likely to gain hy initiating any such campaign of reprisal and counter-reprisal. 4. Unreasonable as the attitude of the Persian Government may he, and contrary to international practice, it seems difficult to do more until the situation actually arises in practice. Then, if for example a substantive British Consul in Persia suddenly falls ill, and no regular officer is available to take his place, Sir R. Clive could select some reliable British merchant and could press the Persian Government to agree to his acting appointment, pointing out the absurdity of the Persian regulation and the inconvenience to which it has given rise. If he were able to obtain the Persian Government’s consent in the first instance, even as an exception, it should prove the less difficult to obtain their consent on subsequent occasions. If, on the other hand, he were unable to obtain their consent, the Consulate would have to be temporarily closed. In such an eventuality His Majesty’s Government will be in a stronger position for indicating to the Persian Government that they may be obliged to reconsider the position as regards one of the Persian. .Persian Consulates in British or Indian territory. 5. I am to enquire whether Mr. Benn concurs in the despatch to Sir R. Clive of instructions in this sense. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Mo. 585. British Legation, Oulhek, 29th July, 1930• Sir, X have the honour, with reference to your despatch No. 79 (E.768/768/34) of February 13th, to inform you that I have for some time past been endeavouring to obtain definite confirmation of the attitude adopted by the Persian Government towards the appointment of non-oarriere acting consular officers, 2. Paragraph 3 of your despatch under reference mentions the requirement that all consular officers in Persia should belong to a regular diplomatic or consular service. I have been unable to trace any such stipulation in recent correspondence with the Persian Government, and in point of fact the latter have, in the meantime, recognised two British merchants (Messrs. Gray and Hutton) as substantive British Consuls) but the Minister of Courtis letter enclosed in ray despatch Mo. 442 of August 23rd last does unquestionably place such a restriction on the appointment of acting consular officers; and in view of the fact that in many cases where an appointment of this sort becomes necessary - (such, for Instance, as the sudden illness of the regular incumbent) * the only man likely to be available to carry on the work, some reliable local British merchant, perhaps, would certainly not possess the qualifications required, I consider even this stipulation highly objectionable. The accompanying copies of correspondence exchanged between The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., /the THE FOREIGH OFFICEthe oriental Secretary to this Legation and the Head of the Protocol Department will he seen to confirm the impression that this is one of the Persian Sovernment«a requirements. It provides, incidentally, an admirable illustration of the latter official*a obstructive and unhelpful methods, of which I have quoted instances in several recent despatches, and which at present, I fear, render any arrangement 'a 1 *amiable w out of the question. 3. I should be grateful if I might be instructed what attitude I should adopt towards this question. Since only acting consuls are involved, I am presumably debarred from replying,as suggested in your despatch under reference, that several Persian consuls, both in the United Kingdom and in India, are not de oarriere . I should, however, be glad to learn whether I may inform the Persian Government that if they insist on this unreasonable stipulation regarding acting consuls. His Majesty’s Government may, in their turn, be forced to reconsider the acceptability of those substantive Persian representatives in British territory who are not de coriere. 4. With regard to the other main question raised in your despatch of February 13th, namely the possibility that the Persian Government might object to the appointment of Indian Political Officers to consular posts in Persia on the grounds that such officers are military rather than civil, I am satisfied that, for the present at any rate, the Persian Government no such objection, since several consular officers now serving jg Persia do, in fact, belong to that service. And in view of the already formidable talent for obstruction /displayed3 displayed by the officials concerned, I hesitate to suggest to their minds the means of further indulgence• 5* One other point raised in your despatch remains to be dealt with* I have hitherto had no good opportunity of raising the question of the Persian Government*s insistence on the furnishing of biographical details on application being made for their agrement to a new consular appointment; but when a suitable opportunity presents itself, I propose to apply for the necessary agr&amp;nent without giving any such biographical details beyond mentioning, perhaps, the last post where the officer was employed. If the Persian Government then demand them, I shall furnish them under cover of a note making it quite clear that such a demand is Irregular and has no basis of right or International usage. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant. (Signed) R. H. CliveEnoloaure No.I» in Tehran deapateh No, 365 of the 29th July, 1930, 5ulh*k. June 24th f 1930. My dear Farrokh Khan, Would you be ao good as to refer to the circular inemorandum No. 11024/967 of the 6 th Shahrlvar 1308 (August 28th 1929) regarding the procedure for the appointiaent of Consular Officers in Persia. The point we are exercised about is the following ones- In a few posts in Persia we have a Vice Consul de carriers and with hi© no more than a Moonshee. If the Vice-Consul falls ill, or for some other cogent reason has to leave his post at once. It is obvious that the work of the Vice Consulate must be carried on. The Moonshee is of no Consular standing and is generally not suitable or able to carry on the work. This must therefore be done by some acting Consul, usually an Englishman residing in the same city engaged in commerce or banking or in some other respectable profession. The circular I refer to above seems to Prelude any such person from carrying on the Vice Consulate until such time as a new Vice Consul can be appointed and reach the post. This, you will admit, would cause serious difficulties for us and I would like to know how you propose we could surmount this inconvenience. Yours sincerely, (Signed) 6 . T. Havard.

T*f(r 2 8 JUL 1950 Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with Lord LSonteagle’s letter of 5th July, No. E 3548/768/34, on the subject of the British Military Attache at Meshed, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of the telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India noted in the margin, and to say that he agrees with the views expressed in the Viceroy’s telegram of 17th July. 2- it will no doubt be preferable, in the circumstances, to avoid j*rxa: &gt;*vJ&lt;iW'further discussion with the Persian Government of the future arrangements contemplated at Meshed. The Secretary of State notes, however, that a verbal assurance only has so far been secured from Taimourtache to the effect that the Persian Government will not insist that the incumbent of the post cf Vice-Consul to be created in substitution for the present post of Military Attache l shall be a Consular Officer de ! carriers , and further, that he iprofesses to see no objection to the appointment of a military officer to the post. Ihe danger that an assurance of this nature may not be regarded as binding on future Persian Governments cannot be overlooked, and Mr. Benn would suggest that Sir Robert- Clive might be asked to express his views as to the possibility of securing at some convenient date in the future a more binding assurance from the Persian Government tc the effect that they will not in fact object to the appointment of serving military officers to the post of Vice-Consul at Meshed. 3^ Copy of this letter is being sent to the War Office.

The instructions finally sent to Sir Robert Clive are contained in the Foreign Office Despatch of 15th February, Ko.79, on P.1235/30, flagged. Paragraph 3 of those instructions deals with the Persian suggestion that all consular officers in Persia should belong to a regular diplomatic or consular service. Paragraph 8 deals with the question of the Military Attach^ at Meshed which is raised in Foreign Office letter of May 12th, now submitted. 2. It will be seen that Sir Robert Clive has secured a verbal assurance from the Minister of Court that no difficulties will be raised to the appointment of a military officer with the rank of Vice Consul to discharge the duties at present discharged by the Military Attache; and that Taimourtache has agreed that no difficulties will be made over the fact that such an officer would not be de carrikre, but that he is anxious that Captain Steveni should be replaced as soon as possible by a different officer who should be the first incumbent of the post under the new style. 3. The War Office are concerned chiefly with the maintaining of an officer with special military experience in this post, and they have apparently no objection to the arrangement now suggested. I am not sure that it is satisfactory. In the first place it is most inconvenient that Captain Steveni should be moved at this moment. He has held his appointment only since March 1928, and has thus almost two years still to go, while his knowledge and special experience are of a character which it will be difficult adequately to replace. Secondly, the assurance given us on the carriere/ 431 Sh tlOOO 2.30oint h carriers question is purely verbal, and it appears from Teheran Despatch of the 18th April that the Persians are still maintaining their demand that all consular officers shall be de carriers. If theyjsucceed in carrying this p&lt; the danger of difficulty over some subsequent appointment of a military officer as (military) Vice Consul may be greatly increased. It is not clear whether,and if so wit] what result, the general question has yet been raised by Sir R.Clive with Taimourtache. 4. While the situation is not satisfactory, I feel at the same time that there is nothing for it but to accept it. The Minister of Court has taken a good paper point in suggesting that the value of the change of appellation of the Military Attach^ would be substantially diminished if the present incumbent were to continue to perform the same duties under a different style and this we cannot, I think, contest. As regards replacement the Army List shows three officers of the appropriate rank with high Russian linguistic qualifications who are at present serving with their Regiments and could therefore presumably be made available, viz., Captain Gatehouse, 7th Light Cavalry, Official Interpreter and first-class Interpretership (January 1925), Captain K.S. Morgan, 19th Hyderabad Regiment, first-class Interpreter (January 1925) and Captain G.Uloth, 7th Light Cavalry, first-class Interpreter (June 1927). The de carriere point is one which will have to stand or fall on its own, but I suggest it might be worth while at this stage to ask the Foreign Office to take it up with Sir Robert Clive while we are consulting India on the subject of a successor to Captain Steveni. Theirisk that some future Persian Government may go back on Taimourtache 1 s verbal assurance is one which may ultimately have to be faced. But/Minute Paper. Department. But it is I suggest worth asking F.O. to ascertain Sir R. Clive T s views at once as to the possibility of securing some more binding form of guarantee. 5.

It will be herd on Captain Steveni, whose record at fleshed has, it is understood, been excellent, that he should lose a staff appointment halfway through its tenure through no fault of his own; and we should perhaps be justified in hinting to the Government of India, as in the draft, that something might be done to compensate him If possible - though no doubt the point will be fully present to them?

It is difficult ■^o see, however, hew Taimourtache T s point can be got ijound, and there are, as you say, other officers, Equally well qualified on paper, and apparently available for the appointment.

Mr.Benn gathers from para.ii of Sir Robert Clive's Despatch, that the Minister of Court not^ l abandoned his suggestion that British Consular Officers in Persia should all belong to a recognised diplomatic or consular service.

It wU1 be remembered that this question was raised more tnan a year ago by the Minister of Court, who stated that the presence or a British Military Attach^ at Meshed was a source of embarrassment to his Government. It was thereafter agreed that in these circumstances it might be well to introduce some arrangement whereby the Military Attach^ at this Consulate-General should in future be styled 'Vice-Consul', provided that some assurance could be obtained from the Persian Government that they would not in fact object to the appointment of a serving military officer as a Vice- Consul at this post. Sir R.Clive now reports that he has obtained a verbal assurance that no difficulties will be raised to the appointment of a military officer with the ranlc of vice-consul. 3.

Please see previous submission on P. 7456/29, flagged below, and the subsequent correspondence between the War Office and the Foreign Office on P. 7828/29 and P. 8222/29. Broadly speaking, the Foreign Office draft instructions take the line suggested in our letter of the 9th December on P. 7456. It appears that our position, so far as international practice goes, is not entirely watertight, but it is to be hoped that Sir Robert Clive will be able to bring the Persians to r / a h^rd reasonable frame of mind. There is something to be said for stiffening the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the despatch, for it is quite essential from our point of view that recognition of the Indian Political Department as a regular service should be secured: but it is perhaps unnecessary to take the point. As regards the appointments of Acting Consuls (paragraph 6), the line taken by the Forei^i Office is reasonable. Paragraph 7- - Request for a record of service.- In the circumstances described, we cannot take exception to the instructions. On page ( / 5th line from the end, 'out of the question' perhaps goes rather far, but it is questionable whether it is worth suggesting 'would be difficult' as an alternative.

British Iis^ati ojn. •l . ! 9 hr an, —7 16th September, 1929 Sir, As you will have Been from other deapatohee the Protoool Department of the Ministry for JPereiHa Affaire hae reoently been manifesting «*reat activity in oonneotion with the appointment and reoor*nition of foreign ooneular offloere in Persia. The question with which I propose to deal in thie despatch Is that of the position of honorary Vice-Consuls. 2 . The Ministry recently addressed to me memoranda on the subject on each particular officer requesting that their Conaaisalons mi&lt;*ht be sent to the Ministry in order that exequaturs n&amp;rht be Issued. k 3, I discussed the matter with the official in charge of the Ministry of Porei rti Affairs, Mir*&amp; Hassan Ali Khan Chaffart, and explained to him that honorary Vice-Consuls did not receive Commissions and that the issue to them of exequaturs was a question for the Persian Government. I added that while the only documents which these officers obtained were letters of authority Issued with the previous sanction of the foreign Office, the Persian Government were of course at liberty to issue them with exequaturs if they wished, although I had never heard of this bain* done in such . cases• the position I find that there is for instance, Mr* Hutton of Sultanabad 4. On enquiring into no uniformity of procedure. The Kirht Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., THU fOHHlCH OmGH.- £ - Sultanabad is in poeBesalon of a oartifioate of appointment issued by the foreign Office and signed by Sir austen Chamberlain in addition to a letter of authority from hie super intend in?* Consular Officer; Mr# Cray of Tabriz, has a letter of authority from Hie Majesty's Consul, Tabriz, while Mr# Jacob at fezd has a similar paper issued by Hie itajeety's Consul-General at Isfahan. In so far ae the similarly placed officials appointed by the woverament cf India are concerned I underet&amp;nd that Mr. Richard eon of Bander Abbae is in possession of a letter of authority issued by the foreign and Political department# Lieut-Colonel A # ii*Diofcaon of the Indian Medical Oervioe, who is attached to the Consulate- Ceneral at Buehire, holds the honorary rank of Consul under, 1 believe, a letter of appointment from the Consul-General, while Major ICharefat, I#M#S., of Gistan holds his rank of honorary Vice-Consul under a similar letter issued by me. S, It is necessary to point cut that these measures taken by the Ministry for ioreism Affaire are not solely directed against British Consular Officers, similar circulars havinp been addressed to all my Colleafuec. While in many points absurd the attitude adopted by the Ministry is, it seems to xae, in other respects understandable# The object of this despatch is accordingly to suf^est that some uniform procedure be adopted for honorary Vice-Consuls whether appointed by the Poreimn Office or the Government of India, I am personally inclined to the view that a letter of authority issued by the Superintending Consul should be sufficienti euffioient for the Persian Government but I am in come doubt as to the correct procedure in view of the fact that Jtorelgn Office Circular £*13826/6168/250 of November 11th 1926, while rendering the Circular of 1924 applicable to the Levant Service in the case of salaried Vice-Consuls did not mention unsalaried Vice-Consuls* I have accordingly the honour to request that I may be provided with a ruling ae to the procedure to be adopted in the future, and to sur-eet that that procedure should be the same both for Levant and Indian Consular Officers* % 6. 3:he Persian Government might perhaps prefer that such letters of authority were all issued by His llajesty’e Minister in his capacity as Consul-General.

The Ministry point out that Mr. Jacob is stated to be an Aotinv British Vice-Consul. fie was appointed to that rank on the 12th April 1927, a letter of authority bein*iseued to him by hi© ©uperintending consular officer, His Majesty*© Consul- General at Isfahan. The Ministry now say that they have a rule that an aotinj? officer can only have chari^e of a consular of the position of Mr. Jacob. The *eix months rule* alluded to is new to me and I have drawn the attention of Mlrsa Hassan Ali Jlhan Chaffer! to this fact, adding that I consider that such a rule is not acceptable, as it interferes with and imposes an unjustifiable restriction upon the liberty of choice of His Majesty's Hepresentative in the selection of consular officers. In the case of Mr. Jacob, however, I feel that it is post for six months, not more, and have asked me for a statement anomalous The Rlwht Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.fi TEA P0RJ3IQB OB’ICAanomalous that he should be oontinually an * Acting’ officer and I have the honour to cuarcrest that he should b© accorded the rank of British Vice-Consul. It is of oourse possible that the In do-Europe an Telegraph Department will move I'r. Jacob elsewhere for service reasons; when his sucoessor mi^ht be similarly appointed. 5. .Should this su^estion be approved, I have the honour to request that His Majesty's Coneul-Ceneral at Isfahan be authorised to issue to Ur# Jacob a new letter of authority and that a certificate of appointment may also be prepared for him. 6# a copy of this despatch has been sent to Hie Majesty* Consul-General at Isfahan.

It will be noted that the Foreigi Office definitely place on record in their letter to the War Office that they are advised that the Persians are not exceeding in theory their strict rights in any one of the points of procedure raised in the recent correspondence regarding the appointment of foreign Consular officers. As regards the Military Attache, they press that Sir Robert Clive should be allowed to make to Taimourtache the frank explanation of the position which His Majesty’s Minister originally recommended, and which the Government of India support. The Secretary of State has agreed as to the desirability of this/ 3997 bthis, but only as a uis aller should Sir Robert Clive fail to secure withdrawal of the Persian demand that all Consular officers should belong to a regular Service. Paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter .- The Foreign Office hark back to their old suggestion that it is undesirable to have two Military Attaches in Persia. The letter is weak on this point. The post is one of great importance both to the War Office and the Government of India, from the General Staff point of view, c and it seems desirable to stand out for its maintenance to the last possible moment.

Please see Tehran despatches 379 of 12th July on P. 5869/29 and 442 of 23rd August on P. 6280/29, on the question of the new procedure proposed by the Persicin Foreiyi Office as regards tne recognition of Consuls and Acting Consuls in Persia. The views of the Government of India will be found in the Viceroy's telegram of the 6th November on P. 714?. 2. The correspondence raises two questions - the first the extent to which we can accept/ the Persian requirements in connection with ordinary Consular appointments; the second that of the special case of the Military Attache at Meshed. As regards the first of these questions, the more important issues are the recognition of the* Indian Foreign and Political Department/is a regular'lliplomatic or consular service for this purpose; the Persian requirement that acting Consular appointments must be|maae from officers vho not only belong to a regular diplomatic or consular service, but are actually serving in a Legation or Consulate in Persia at the time of appointment; and thirdly the Persicin request that applications for the recognition of a Consul, whether acting or substantive, shall be accompanied by the record of service of the officer. 3. I understand from the Foreiga Office that the Government of India overestimate the strength of our position, that the investigations they have made in fact show that the Persians are within their strict rights in the various demands they have made, and that it would be dangerous for us to rely overmuch on the arguments used in the Viceroy’s telegram. On the _ ooo ^ question of practice we must be advised by the Foreign Office/Office. But we are entitled to expect reasonable give and take in a matter such as tne present; and Sir Rooert) Clive’s Despatches suggest that the difficulty in reaching a modus vivcndi should not be insuperable. In these circumstances, I suggest that we should take the line - (a) that Sir Robert Clive should be instructed, if no objection is seen, in the first place to contest the view that all Consular officers in Persia must necessarily belong to a regular consular service. Should he be unable to secure this, and should international practice not justify us in pressing our demand, he should aim at a clear understanding that officers of the foreign and Political Department, whether military or civil, shall rank as members of a regular consular service for tne present purpose. The lack of any immediate military significance in the titles of military officers of the Department could be explained as suggested by the Government of India; (b) that the Persian requirement that officers nominated to acting appointments shall actually be in consular or legation service in Persia at the time of such nomination shall be rejected. Its acceptance would clearly give rise to very great inconvenience; (c) that we need not raise any objection to the ■ A u /V/7 ^ Jf. 20 Ay , kr^Ou^j request for a record of service,o&gt;r ^ *hr &gt;v^vAyv, ^ /X „ , - - . - r 11 J~\ t !' tKy C&lt;+/. A. U 4. As regards the Military Attache at Meshed, it \\^L^ J' will be remembered that, consequent on representations ^ 7 from Taimourtache, it was decided, m order to make it easier for Persia to resist Soviet demands for a Military Attache in Seistan, that, on the expiry m about two years of the term of appointment of the(asb) Minute Paper. POLiTiCiiL Department. CIaatX. , Ivd/ XXZMjLvx/' *** Uz. L *-f-CAjJijL 6k Ua Pc, +«7 if Cu*-j&lt; (/(uq P- . present Military Attache, the title of the post t should* be altered to Vice-Consul. It was agreed that it was one which must be held by a serving soldier, and that a military Political would not meet the needs of the General Staff. Acceptance of the Persian demand that only regular diplomatic or consular officers should hold Consular posts would clearly create a very difficult position in this connection. The question is one primarily for the V f ar Office, whose views on the question of tactics are given in their letter of 20th November to the Foreign Office. It will be seen that they are at variance with those of Sir Robert Clive and the Government of India. The explanation is partly, it is suggested, that they have read the sentence marked 'A” in the Government of India's telegram as applying ^ to military officers generally, and not to military Politicals only. It has been suggested above that in the first place Sir Robert Clive should aim at securing the withdrawal of the Persian demand that Consuls shall be appointed from regular consular services only. If the Foreign Office agree and he succeeds, no difficulty will any longer arise about the Military Attache. But should this not be the case, as tho post is one of great importance to us the next best course seems clearly that suggested by the Minister and accepted by India, and the difficulty in adopting it should be further lessened by the fact that it was Taimourtache himself who first drew attention to the embarrassing reactions for Persia of the present title of the Military Attache. 3818a 5000 8.29(Po 745 V29) Note for c.umunicatlon to Sir Ro Clive The Political Department of the Grovercrnent of India is essentially a civil Service 9 and is classed as such for purposes of pay, leave, etc 0 It is recruited hy transfer from the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Aruy* On appointment to the Department, military officers are formally transferred to civil employmento After 1C years 1 service in it 8 their transfer becomes permanent, they are struck off the effective list of the'Airoy, and they are not thereafter liable to retransfer to military dutyo During the first 1C years of their service they remain liable to such retransfer in case of emergency only.

The Secretary of State has carefully considered, in the light of/ 3523 5000 3.29of War Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 20th Hovember, ho. 0162/658(M*0.2), and of the views c|f Sir R.

Should Sir R.Clive, however, be unable to secipe this, the Secretary of State, subject to any further observations which the Army Council may have to offer of opinion that the best course to adopt in the matter would be that proposed in para.6 of Teheran Despatch Io.442 of 23rd August, and supported by the Government of India.

It is true that the draft instructions enclosed in their letter of the 10th September do not go very far. But it may be better, before agreeing even to return an acknowledgment, to be quite sure as to what reservations we wish to make, and we cannot, A I think, do this until we have the Government of India's views. It will clearly be essential when the time comes for us to press that there shall be no misunderstanding as to the recognition of officers of the/the Indian Political Department, whether military or civil, as members of a regular Consular service. The question of the Military Attache at Meshed is not so straightforward, but that can be considered later.

In view of the Minister of Court 1 s letter this will become impossible unless the future Military Attaohi should happen to be a member of the Indian Political Service. 6. I am inclined, therefore, to think, subject to your views and those of the Government of India, that it might be best to come out into the open over this question and for us frankly to explain the position to the Minister of Court. 'The Persian Government are, of course, perfectly aware of the reasons why we have, for many years past, had a Military Attache at Meshed, and of the nature of his work. There is nothing in this work which in any way conflicts with Persian interests • in fact, I understand that the present Military Attach! is on excellent terms with the Persian Military Authorities, and often provides them with interesting information. 7. If, however, I am instructed to contest the view that all Consular Officers in Persia must necessarily belong to the regular Consular service, in which I include, in the case of Persia, the Indian Political service, then it will still be possible • provided the Persian Government yield on thle point ~ to appoint to the post of a Vice Consul at Meshed /anyany officer wh&amp;i: the Covernaent of India -my wish.
