The boat of Syeed Hamza of Johanna, on whose behalf Macdonald had already intervened, had been plundered in the same place. Stannus encloses a statement from the nackoda [nakhoda] of the bugla and draws attention to the similarity of such acts among the people of Dashty [Dashti] to the systematic piracy that had formerly prevailed in the Gulf, which the British were bound to suppress by treaty and policy.The letter encloses a statement relating to the wreck and plunder of the bugla, dated at Bushire 10 June 1826, which contains an account of the incident, a summary of the vessel's cargo, and a list of those items that were known to be insured.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x000095#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
