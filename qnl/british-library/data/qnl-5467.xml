An officer with Gulf experience is urgently needed in that department and we are therefore anxious to withdraw Stewart as soon as possible. Could you release him immediately and make acting arrangements at Muscat until we can make another^officer available? If so, please instruct him to return by air and inform him that we shall do our best to ensure that he gets a fair spell of leave later in the year. We should have to ask him to join Eastern Department almost immediately on his return. 3. As successor we are considering the appointment of Ellison, now First Secretary and Consul at Panama. t p0 ^ rtf' Ri fi&amp;xfcuj He is 52 and has considerable experience of Arabic speaking countries, including Saudi Arabia.

Horcver, £925 is an arbitrary figure which has been chosen by the Civil ervice Commission, as explained in their letter to nr. patkmelrA Jime, copy of which is on X30113(125/47). Hr. Ilondersto tells do that we are however already coiir.iitted to the salaries approved for these ex-Indian officers and that there can bo no question of changing them now otherwise there will be mas© resignations. Presumably therefore Hr. htewart will go up by annual increments of £30 on hi© starting salary of £925. But I understand we shall have to give a date from which the pay of those officers starts. Hr. Henderson tolls ne that the Civil Service Condseion (rdTs Collet) are trying to get the Treasury to agree that the date on which oach man ©tarts work, eitixer with the Foreign office or for the High Comnissloner’s service , or, in Stewart's case, in the Persian Gulf, should be the incremental date rogordleeo of whether the officer was still on ordinary leave from the 1.3*3. or not at that time. Strictly speaking we apparently cannot take a nan on our pay-roll even not!anally unless lie is on retirement leave. There are several letters of etppointnisnt for off icons serving on the High Commie loner’s staff in India who are becoming medbere of the Foreign Service which tire going to nr Ranee for approval and I suggest that you co-ordinate any action you take on Stewart’s letter of appointment closely with Hr. j once. As x»egards the foreign Allowance, the Treasury have agreed the figure of £1500 as a provisional foreign allowance for Mr. Stewart at useat. As you say, wo shall have to consider when and how payment will be . jade to Hr. Stewart and other Foreign Service officers sexving In the Persian Gulf. As from the data when the Government of India ceases to f .nance the establishment© in the Persian Gulf, which will presumably be from August 15th, the India Office will assume the administration of those establishments. It seems to ra© logical therefore, particularly in order to .avoid any muddle, that the India Office should administer the whole of these establishment© including/—— 7 ,- - . rr- _ V' including perLianent Foreign Oervice officers working there until we take ovor the whole issue at a later date. If we start paying, say, Stewart, from here there may well he a Muddle. I would suggest th^t it would he preferable for the India Office to make the actual payments and operate our Branch A Regulations for those officers of Branch A, like Stewart, serving in the Persian Gulf. We shall of course maintain very close liaison with the India Office on any question of administration and shall he pleased to advise thorn what action to take in any question of payment of these officers or the opera k ion .oik our Hegulations ’ 'here /in t. 5 in Tndift : f they are coii8W59#Ct' 1 Indeed the India Office may ask us to perform specific services for those officers, recovering later from the India Office Vote. For example, the actual payment of the salaries of regular Branch A officers or arranging and paying in the first instance for their travelling, hut I think the principle should he established that as the India Office is responsible for the time being for these establishments and the officers manning then initial fiction should lie with them and action by us should he confined to specific rOcy opto from then for such action or for our advice. I am sending a copy of this minute to Mr. Donaldson in the India Office for iris observations.
