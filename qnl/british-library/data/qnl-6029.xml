I have discussed the matter with the Shaikh, and he asks me to say that he only wants one saluting gun, and that for his small motor dhow 'Kuwait”• His idea is to mount It in the bows, to give a smart aprearance to his yacht, and to enable him to give the signal to his various Pearling fleets, when he goes out at the end of the season and recalls them to Kuwait. 3. The Shaikh said he was told by the Political Resident the gun all told would cost £30-0-0 and as he could only run to this amount he decided to ask the Political Resident to get one for him. 4. He does not he said want any other guns for shore saluting purposes, hence a second gun will be useless tc him. 5. What the Shaikh suggests is that the Senior Naval Officer first find out what the exact cost of the single gun which he wants will come to together with naval mounting and say 50 brass cartridges ( not 100 as originally asked f cr), and other absolutely necessary accessories, 4 Ls he anticipates the total cost will come to more than £30/- now that a lot of accessories are neeoded.

He rightly dare not launch out into any needless extravagance, for as it is, he is only just able to balance his budget. 7 I hope I have made myself clear. The wholeD.O.

The Shaikh of Kuwait has asked us to obtain for him one thousand British Army rifles and one million rounds of ammunition. It is presumed that he intends to pay for them. He explained that the present rifles in the State were old German, Turkish and other obsolete types and that he wanted new ones to equip his State guards. It is clearly necessary that his guards should be adequately armed and Galloway has recommended that we should accede to his request. 2. I understand that rifles of the British Army type can only be obtained through the War Office. If you agree, therefore that we should comply In the Shaikh*s request, I / should be grateful if you could kindly ascertain whether the War Office can make the rifles and ammunition available and if so, at what price. I will then ask Galloway to confirm that the Shaikh is willing to meet the cost. 3. I have requests from other Rulers for permission to purchase British Army rifles pending, and we are under an obligation to supply the Sultan of Muscat with 10,000 rounds of .303 ammunition annually. It might perhaps save you trouble if we were to correspond direct with the V.ar Office in such cases, sending you a copy of the original demand in each case so that you can interfere if you see any political objection. If you agree with this proposal would you kindly let me know whom we should address at the War Office? CSi-mea) V. R. HAY. B.A.B.

(E 4219/1196/91) Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to your letter No. 100/19/49 of 28th February regarding rifles and ammunition for the Shaikh of Kuwait. You may not be aware that the position regarding arms, and particu larly ammunition, is extremely tight, and until measures to increase production are put into effect there will be difficulty for some ti^e to come in meeting demands for ammunition parti cularly. The War Office have agreed to make 1,000 rifles available but at first found themselves unable to provide any ammunition whatever. We have, however, prevailed upon them to release 100,000 rounds from War Office stocks, to which they have agreed on condition that it is made clear to the Shaikh that the ammu nition position is difficult and that it is hoped that he will conserve the use of the ammunition as far as possible and not make the fact that he has been supplied with 1,000 rifles an argument for insisting on the supply of further ammunition. His demand for 1,000,000 rounds has been noted, however, and an attempt will be made to meet it from new production as this comes into supply. The cost of the 1.000 rifles with bayonet, scabbard, and sling would be £4,470 (at surplus rates). This is not an en tirely firm figure as it is the Ministry of Supply and not the War Office which would be responsible for making the sale. The 100,000 rounds of ammunition would cost £1,746 (ex depot). As regards your proposal that you should correspond direct with the War Office over requests of Rulers for arms, we con sider that on the whole it is more convenient^for the corres pondence to be made through us as policy considerations enter with which we must concern ourselves. I am sending a copy of this letter to Major Rodgers at the War Office. Yours sincerely, T.E. ROGERS pp B.A.B. BURROWS.

Subsequently, the correspondence in the file discusses a request made by Shaikh Ahmad in 1948 to purchase another saluting cannon of the same type, a thousand rifles (with a million rounds of ammunition) and two hundred pistols (folios 42-95).The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire, but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with Shaikh Ahmad (in Arabic accompanied by English translations).On folio 8, the file contains a simple, hand-drawn diagram of the base of a three-pounder saluting gun.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military ceremonies, honours, and salutes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
