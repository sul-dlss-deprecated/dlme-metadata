Much depends on purpose for which Sultan requires these arms and you should suggest to 3 ta ^ that before proceeding further they should make furth pnnmries on this point. If, for instance, as is thought likely they are required for Dhogar (where Sultan airea y possesses American machine guns and rifles Rented to him in return for air facilities) we would not vash to ^raise any obiection, provided ammunition is not suppli rifles'and only 150,000 rounds are supplied.

Amount of ammunition asked for by Sultan is 150,000 rounds and not 500,000 as stated in your telegram 13035, 16th July. If rifles are supplied, I see no objection to this amount of ammunition being also supplied* 3. American Consul told me he had heard that State Department were not, repeat not, anxious to supply arms and ammunition and had referred to (?Consulate). X therefore told him that I had been consulted and had recommended that Sultan should be asked to state purpose for which arms required. 4, I mentioned vaguely to Consul that Sultan wished to extend his control over the interior, but did not say anything about his request to H,M.
