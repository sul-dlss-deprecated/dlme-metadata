SECRET. 114 ^JNOTES BY THE AIR STATE ON THE REGULATION OF AIR CONTROL IN UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE use ot Air Power as an instrument for the control of semi-civilized countries is still a recent development, and it is important that all who are in one way or another concerned with its regulation should fully understand the methods by which it operates. The following notes describe the cardinal points of the regulation of this form of control. 1. Moral effect of Air 'power. It is a generally accepted axiom that the air arm achieves its chief results through the moral effect it produces on the enemy, and when employed in backward countries there is the favourable factor that the enemy has little or no air resources with which to counter our action. This enhances the moral effect on the inhabitants, who are contronted with a weapon against which they cannot retaliate. 2. Necessity for co-operation between the A ir Force Commander and the local The proper employment of air power is essentially dependent on the most intimate co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local political authority. If air operations are to be successful, it is vital that all concerned with their conduct, whether civilian administrators or officers of the fighting services, should realise that success is dependent on the effect produced on the enemy morale. To obtain this moral effect, air forces do not require to get to grips with the enemy, nor do they produce tangible and visible results, such as prisoners of war, casualties to our own personnel and definite advances into the enemy’s country. During active air operations there are few of the recognised signs of warfare; there are no long columns, no marching and counter-marching, no Red Cross ambulances, and none of the so-called panoply of war. Consequently, those who in the past have only been accustomed to fighting on the ground, where nothing can be achieved without gaining actual physical contact with the enemy and defeating him in battle, are not always able to appreciate the effect that air action produces on the enemy's morale and mentality. In land warfare the progress of operations is slow, and it is possible to estimate the result of a particular operation and to foresee the approaching end when one combatant will surrender or ask for an armistice. The political authorities have been able to follow the course of the operations and are well aware when the final scene is set and it is their turn to enter the arena and to conduct the peace negotia tions. In air warfare it is not possible to follow the operations stage by stage, and that is especially the case when the operations are carried out against a semi-civilised enemy, and when it is consequently difficult to judge the moral effect of air action on his mentality. In this tvoe of warfare it is essential that the Air Officer Commanding and the local political authority should act together and maintain the closest touch, so that the Commanding Officer, assisted by the advice of the political officer and by his intimate knowledge of the characteristics of the enemy, can keep his finger on the pulse of the enemy morale and nerves and decide, subject to any overriding political consideration, on the most favourable objectives for attack and can sav whether air action should be continued or suspended against former objectives, or whether the bombing should be distributed over a wider area. Unless this close touch is maintained, the Air Officer Commanding cannot advise when the right moment has arrived for air operations to be temporarily suspended, and for the political authority to endeavour to initiate peace negotiations. The air arm is a delicate weapon which is easily blunted if misused, either by wielding it too early or too late, and especially too much. How, where, when and in what degree it is to be employed are questions upon which the Air Officer Commanding on the spot, and he alone, can give authoritative advice with the aid of the local political officer, and by using his experience in estimating the effect of the air operations on the morale and mentality of those against whom the operations are being conducted. Political Authorities.Air Staff, November 21, 1928. Air operations, when carried out against an enemy whose existence is not dependent on a highly organised civilisation, are liable if unduly protracted to create an attitude of sullen resignation. Consequently, as soon as there is reason to believe that the morale of the enemy is affected by the interference with his normal mode of life, then offensive air action should be temporarily suspended. An opportunity is thus created for the enemy formally or informally to indicate whether the operation' have effected a change in his attitude. If that is the case it should be our policy to take immediate advantages of this change of heart to avoid any unnecessary prolongation of air warfare. Otherwise the next stages in active operations are more difficult since the enemy will probably leave his towns and villages and live in the open or in caves. Air operations then become more difficult to undertake and require a longer time to achieve results. It is not, perhaps, appreciated that the air arm under these conditions exerts pressure on an enemy in very much the same way as diplomacy. The power of the diplomat and of the air arm alike rest on the fact that the enemy does not know how far we are prepared to go in order to attain our ends; nor does he know what steps we will take to attain them. This close connection between political force and air power entails the necessity for the most intimate co-operation between the political authority and the Air Officer Commanding. 3. The Importance of “ Intelligence’' Just as early and accurate information based on a sound intelligence organisation is essential to political authorities to enable them to achieve results, so the Air Officer Commanding is dependent on his intelligence service if he is to obtain a quick, economical and humane success. When land forces are employed for punitive operations, their movements are probably limited to the speed of a camel, or of a horse or a man. If air forces are employed, moving 20 times faster than the older arms, then it is essential that the speed with which they receive information should be similarly accelerated. To make the fullest use of air power, an enemy or a disturber of the peace living 200 or 300 miles away from an air force must be made to feel that any act of insurrection or violence will meet with retribution within 12 to 24 hours of its commission. The offender must not be allowed to feel, as he will if land forces are employed, that punishment will tarry and that he may be able to use the interval to evade it. Even if the case is one in which the Political authoritv decides that bombing would not be justified, the air arm should still be made use of, to enable the Political authorities to reach the scene of the trouble and to deal with the matter on the spot within a few hours of it arising. If full use is made of air communications to speed up the diplomatic and administrative action, much can be done to obviate the trouble spreading, and a small misdemeanour can be prevented from developing into a rising on a large scale, and this speeding up is dependent upon a fully organized intelligence system. 4. Necessity for swiftness of decision and action in times both of negotiations and active operations. The essential characteristic of the air arm is rapidity of action; this depends not only upon a quick and accurate Intelligence Service, but also on quick decision to initiate air action. It is of the highest importance once the necessary authority is obtained that the local political officer should come to a prompt decision, in oonjunction with the Air Officer Commanding, both on the initiation of air action and on its extension when the situation demands it within the limit of his instructions. 5. Limitations of Air power. The air arm is essentially an offensive weapon and can do little towards defending a country if its actions are confined to the tactical defensive. For the success of air operations aircraft must have room for manoeuvre, and so be in a position to locate and attack an enemy some hours before he has reached a position where he can do harm. It is, therefore, important, once it has been decided to initiate air action, not to tie down the aircraft to narrow geographical limits.[19366] [This Docament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.

From ’’B” on 1 it will be seen that it was agreed that Departments should communicate to the Secretary of the C.I.D. a list of officers to whom the xVir Staff memorandum on the regulation of air control in undeveloped countries was to be ... , forwarded. It was agreed with the military Department that they should be consulted on the question of distribution, and that the actual distribution might wait until we saw what was proposed by the War Office in the case of the British service. Since then the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office have rang up to ask that we should make ourselves responsible (through the Government of India) for the distribution of copies of this memorandum to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the political officers under him. They, on the other hand, would make themselves responsible for the distribution at Aden. I said that I thought no objection to this, and that we would take action accordingly in due course. Colonel Isrnay now tells me that the C.I.D. are anxious to get on at once with the question of distribution, and that they would like, if possible, an immediate decision. The Air Ministry are pressing them to dispose of the question without delay. I explained that it was very difficult for us here to judge what distribution the 1 Government of India would wish to give to this memo rani urn/ v X Lmemorandum; that, apart from senior military officers, a certain number of copies would probably have to be distributed to civil officers on the frontier; and that the Government of India alone were in a position to judge what the distribution should be. We should • • • therefore normally prefer to consult them first. After discussion, it was agreed that the simplest course would be that the G.I.D. should be asked to forward 50 copies for transmission to the Government of India for distribution at their discretion - the Government of India to be asked to submit a list of the authorities to whom distribution had been made, and to return any undistributed copies, should the number forwarded prove excessive. Should they, on the contrary, desire further copies, these could be supplied in due course, on receipt from the Government of India through this Office of a statement of the officers to whom they were to go. Liilitarv Secretary . 17 1 For favour of observations. I think the course suggested above is probably the simplest in the circumstances. If you agree, this Department will write to Colonel Ismay as in the draft. v' 5 Ul 3 «1a- r\Draft Paper. r 314 6 1 o fc &gt; o 1 r ^ -K Lieut,-Col. H.L.

Department. 7n ft'- f-j MAY'iS?5 'My dear Israay, You will remember that we had a discussion the other day about the distribution to be given to the Air Staff memorandum on the regulation of air control in undeveloped countries, which I gathered from you has now been finally approved, I explained our difficulty in recommending a particular distribution without consultation with the Government of India. I also mentioned, on a minor point, that the Colonial Office had asked, and we had agreed,to make ourselves responsible for the distribution of copies of the memorandum to the officials in the Persian Gulf. The Colonial Office, on the other hand, were prepared to make themselves responsible for Aden. After discussion we agreed that the simplest course would be, so as to avoid delay, that this Office o . \ should ask for 50 copies of the memorandum for despatch to the Government of India, the Government of India to furnish^ a list of the officers to whom distribution had been made for communication to the kr 5000 11.28 C.I.D./C.I.D.; to return spare copies &lt;rr should there be any r should they on the other hand, wish for a larger number than 50, to indicate their requirements and the names of the officers to whom the memorandum would be issued. In addition to the 50 copies for distribution to the Government of India, we should like three copies for retention in this Office. They would be distributed to the Under Secretary of State, the Military Secretary and the Political Secretary. We should be glad, if no objection is seen, if action might be taken accordingly by the C.I.D. 4. a t-AiMinute Paper. political Department. r 3222a 5000 11/28 At the (9th) meeting of the Persian Gulf •ffcCf.p Sub-Committee held on Monday, 18th March, 1929, it was agreed:- (a) to approve in principle the notes by the Air Staf/ on the regulation of air control in undeveloped countries, subject to: (i) the deletion of the following passage in paragraph 4: 'or in cases wnere reference to higher authority is not required'; (ii) such corrections in points of detail as may be agreed on as the result of detailed examination of the notes by the Departments concerned; (b) that with regard to (a) (ii) above, any detailed amendments that are desired should be communicated to the Secretary not later than Thursday, 28th March (if no amendments are received by thatdate r the concurrence of Departments will be assumed); (c) that the Air Staff note referred to in (a) above should be circulated for information by the Departments concerned to all administrators and political officers concerned with this problem; (d) that, in order to avoid overlapping or lacunae, the Departments should communicate to the Secretary of the Committee a list of officers to whom they propose to forward the paper in question; (e) that the Secretary should, on behalf of the Committee, ascertain from the Secretary of State for ■^ar whether he desires to circulate the Air Staff Note, and if so, to what authorities. ..giit^ry Sec re tar y . I attach a copy of the Air Staff note referred/ // r -Jm -referred to above. Would you be so good as to say whether you have any observations on it which should be suggested to the C.I.D.? From the point of view of this Department it is, I think, on the whole unobjectionable, and adequately safeguards the principle that the initiation of air action must be governed by specific or general instructions emanating from His Majesty’s Government. ^ . 7U «*-*y ^ CV-O. «&lt;e^/ 6k etc ^ -{ TL tfoju Ifrsluu* iLlf tiA (vA x fa tr* djLKXJ^L CU JaaX. OtL i£0: Notea on the regulation of a ir control in undeveloped countries* The use of Air Po^er as an instrument for the control of serai civilized countries is still a recent development^ and it is important that all who are in one way or another concerned with its regulation should fully understand the methods by which it operates. The following notes describe the cardinal points of the regulation of this fonn of control. Moral Bffect of Air Power . It is a generally accepted axiom that air power achieves its chief results through the moral effect it produces on the enemy, and when employed in backward countries there is the favourable factor that the enemy has little or no air power to counter our action. This enhances the moral effect on the inhabitants, who are confronted with a weapon against which they cannot retaliate. —? 3 j 1 ! ,y fo^Co -operation between the Air Force Commander and tne Local Political Authoriti es. The proper employment of air power is essentially dependent on the most intimate co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local political authority. If air operations are to be successful, it is vital that all concerned with their conduct, whether civilian administrators or officers of the fighting services, should realise that success is dependent on the effect produced on the enemy morale. To obtain this moral effect, air forces do not require to get to grips with the enemy, nor do they produce tangible and visible results, such as prisoners of war, casualties to our own personnel and definite advances into the enemy f s country. During active air operations there are few of the recognised si-jns of warfare 5 there are no long columns, no marching and counter-marching, no red cross ambulances, and none of the so called panoply of war. Consequently, those who in the past have only been accustomed to fighting on the ground, where nothing can be achieved without gaining actual physical contactv^lth the enemy and defeating him in battle, are not always able to appreciate the effect that air action produces on the enemy's morale and mentality. In land warfare the progress of operations is slow and it is possible to estimate the resu of a particular operation and to foresee the approaching end when one combatant will surrender or ask for an armistice. The political authorities have been able tofollow the course of the operations and are well aware when the final scene is set and It is their turn to enter the arena and to conduct the peace negotiations. In air warfare it is not possible to follow the operations stage by stage, and that is especially the case when the operations are carried out against a semi-civilised enemy, and when it is consequently difficult to judge the moral effect of air action on his mentality. In this type of warfare it is essential that the Air Officer Commanding and the. local political authority should act together and maintain the closest touch so that the Commanding Officer, assisted by the advice of the political officer and by hie intimate knowledge of the characteristics of the enemy, can keep his finger on the pulse • of the enemy morale and nerves and decide on the most favourable objectives for attack and can say whether air action should be continued or suspended against former objectives or whether the bombing should be distributed over a wider area. Unless this close touch is maintained, the Air Officer Commanding cannot say when the right moment has arrived for air operations to be temporarily suspended,■and for the political authority to endeavour to initiate peace negotiations. The air arm is a delicate weapon which is easily blunted if misused, either by wielding it too early or too late, and especially too much. How, where, when and in what degree it is to be employed are questions which the Air Officer Commanding on the spot, and he alone, can decide with the aid of the local political officer, and by using his experience in estimating the effect of the air operations on the morale and mentality of those against whom the operations pre being conducted.I I i k HU.. : 3* • 3. Air operations, rfaen carried out against an enemy whose existence is not dependent on a highly organised civilisation, are liable if unduly protracted to create an attitude of sullen resignation. Consequently as soon as there is reason to believe that the morale of the enemy is affected by the interference with his normal mode of life, then offensive air action should be temporarily suspended. An opportunity is thus created for the enemy formally or informally to indicate whether the operations have effected a change In his attitude. If that is the case it should be our policy to take immediate advantages of this change of heart to avoid any unnecessary prolongation of air warfare# Otherwise the next stages in active operations are more difficult since the enemy will probably leave his towns and villages and live in the open or in oaves (if they are available)# Air operations then become more difficult to undertake and require a longer time to achieve results# It is not, perhaps, appreciatedthat the air arm under these conditions exerts pressure on an enemy in very much the same way as diplomacy# The power of the diplomat and of the air arm alike rest on the fact that the enemy does not know how far we are prepared to go in order to attain our ends; nor does he know what steps we will take to attain them# This close connection between political force and air power entails the necessity for the most intimate co-operation between the political authority and the Air Officer Commanding. The Import ance of ^Intelligence' Just as early and accurate information based on a sound intelligence organisation is essential to political authorities to enable them to achieve results, so the Air Officer Commanding is dependent on his intelligence service if he is to obtain a quick, economical and humane success. When land forces are employed for punitive operations, their movements are probably limited.to the speed of a camel, or of a horse or a man. If air forces are employed, moving 20 times I v 1 v4 faster thap the older arras, then it is essential that the speed with which they receive information should be similarly accelerated* To make the fullest use of air power, an enemy or a disturber of the peace living 200 or 300 miles away from an air force must be made to feel that any act of insurrection or violence will meet with retribution within 12 to 24 hours of its commission* The offender must not be allowed to feel, as he will if land forces are employed, that punishment will tarry and that he may be able to use the interval to evade it. Even if the case is one in which the Political authority decides that bombing ^uld not be justified, the air arm should still be made use of, to enable the Political authorities to reach the scene of the trouble and to deal with the matter on the spot within a few hours of it arising* If full use is made of air communications to speed up the diplomatic and administrative action, much can be done to obviate the trouble spreading, and a small misdemeanour can be prevented from developing into a rising on a large scale, and this speeding up is dependent upon a fully organized intelligence system* necessity for swiftne ss of decision and action in times both of negotiations and active operations^ The essential characteristic of the air arm is rapidity of action; this depends not only upon a Quick and accurate Intelligence Service, but also on quick decision to initiate air action* It Is of the highest importance once the necessary authority is obtained - or in cases where reference to higher authority is not required - that the local policital authority should come to a prompt decision. In conjunction with the Air Officer Commanding, both on the initiation of air action and on its extension when the situation demands it within the limit of his Instructions. 5* Limitations of Air Power * The Air arm is essentially an offensive weapon and can do little towards defending a country if its actions are confined5# to the tactical defensive. For the success of air operations aircraft must have room for manoeuvre* and so be in a position to locate and attack an enemy some hours before he has reached a position Fhere he can do harm. It is, therefore, important once it has been decided to initiate air action not to tie do^m the aircraft to narrow geographical limits.
