I explained to Shaikh Hamed the various sections especially those which have been revised or inserted. I think Shaikh Hamed now understands them though he found it difficult to follow the meaning in the Arabic translation. The points which interested him were firstly the amount of money payable and secondly the various conditions safeguarding his own property. He was rather dissatisfied by the amount of the minimum royalty but I reminded him that it was previously only Rs 30,000 and that probably two shiploads of oil would exceed this sum in royalties. When this was explained he seemed satisfied. He again said that the Company should be made to export the oil which they are able to produce, I explained that we could not make them do this. Shaikh Sulman told Shaikh Hamed that in his opinion the Company were anxious to export oil as then they would make some money. • Shaikh Hamed was pleased that provision had been made to ensure that he would be compensated ofr any appropriation by the Company of his privately owned open land. I think though he considered that his compensation in this event should be different to that laid down for ordinary people, after discussing this point he said ' Never mind ' and agreed to it. He was especially pleased that in the case of arbitration the case would be dealt with according to English law, he seemed to attach considerable importance to this point. lam sure that he expected that on signing the lease he would receive some cash benefit for himself from the Company, he asked whether there was no mention of this anywhere. Shaikh Hamed asked whether the, were to be allowed to continue drilling more and more wells without having to pay anything more, it is difficult to make nim realise that it should be advantageous to him for the Company to drill many wells, on several other occasions he has expressed the same idea^ implying that they should only be allowed to drill more wells if they pay more cash.. Shaikh Sulman and I explained that the more wells they ^rilled the more oil they should be able to sell. I spent a long time explaining these points but it was very difficult to keep Shaikh Hamed's attention on the matter, he found the length of tne Agreement very long and his attention strayed. On the whole however w as satisfied with what had been done for him. ^ _ I have mentioned the particular points which he raised u would say that Shaikh Sulman had a clearer understanding oi tne Matter, it was the end of the day, and Ramadan, not the best time for taoklins a su ^ ct ofHo:C/1005-10/1.

Dear Sir, I beg to refer to the arrangements made at our meeting on the 2?rd. December 1954 in regard to the signing of the proposed Mining Lease* S. I have now received the English typescript and am arranging to have the Arabic typed in. This should be i finished by the afternoon of the S7th December: and I would propose teat the text, both English and Arabic, should be read pver by responsible representatives of the Bahrain Petrolepm Company Limited and the Agency in order to ensure that there are no errors. S. I propose that the Assistant Political Agent and the Head Munshi of the Agency should do this on my behalf and should be glad if you would inform me who will ' ** 1 represent the Company. 4. I would suggest 5.00 p .m a't the Agency on the 27th December. ,1 fear that the hour is not a very convenient one, but I am doubtful whether the typing will be completed before then, and I am sure that you will agree that it is desirable to place the final text before His ixcellency Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah. for his approval as early as possible.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, I write Iri contoiiuation of my letter of 14tla DecemlDer, nurntiered. as a 1 oove, to say that we have now heard from the Political Agent, Bahrein that the redrafts provisionally agreed 'between us of Article I su T d -paragraph 2 and Article II, suh-paragraph 1 of the Mining Lease have been discussed by Colonel Loch at a meeting at which Messrs. Russell, Hamilton, Davies, Belgrave and Worth were present, in the light of which the redrafts were agreed, subject to/the following observations;- (a) A line containing municipal areas to be drawn after check, to be carried out at once, by representativss of the sheikh and of the Company; (b) The radius of the circle in the case of Sakhir is 300 yards, (c) It ms thought desirable to place on record at once, lest misunderstanding should arise in the future, the areas privately owned by the sheikh other than those in or covered by (a) and (b). (d)/ Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd., 19, Moorgate, E.C. 2.(d.) lij was a,grG6cl ijiio.'t thssG 3-rGcis wsrsj the hunting lodges at Rumaithah; Urriiri-al-Talah (including palm plantations), Amr, and Sakhir garden: respectively■5, 20, 10 and 23 acres or thereabouts. There are also unculuivated areas o£ ahout 3 utiles (.subject to further check) 'by one-eighth mile adjoining Sakhir where the sheikh exercises his horses, and 4,000 acres or thereabouts at Zallaq. (e) It appears that the Company already use at Zallaq an area of 18 acres for their water supply and a strip 20 yards wide for a water pipe line, which will be shown by a blue line on the map, (f) It was agreed that the areas mentioned in (d) 3 of which the positions are roughly known, should be surveyed by representatives of the sheikh and of the Company and placed on record, after acceptance by the Sheikh, by an exchange of letters between the Chief Local Representative and Colonel Loch, colonel Loch remarks that this work need not delay the signature of the Mining Lease. I mentioned to you that there is a reference to compensation in the Political Agent's telegram. Ihis is, however, corrupt, and I have asked for a repetition, i will write to you about this later. 3/3. Colonel Locti acicls t/iialj 'to save 'tiriie 'the 0 Adviser lias been given a typewritten copy, in English and Arabic, corrected up to date, so that he will he in a position to discuss the matter with the sheikh at leisure. 4. It was suggested that it would be convenient if an English and Arabic text, with the alterations caused by the present redrafting, were to be printed in London and sent out by the air mail leaving England on 22nd December. I have discussed this with you and we have agreed that, as the Political Agent will have by the middle of this week the Arabic texts which Mr. Arberry kindly produced of Article I, sub-paragraph 2 and Article II, sub-paragraph 1, and also the carbon copy showing the various corrections which Mr. Arberry has inserted to bring the Arabic text into conformity with the English text, the simplest course will be that the lease should be signed on a text typewritten locally. Copies of this could be sent home and the Company could no doubt arrange to have the necessary prints in English and Arabic produced at leisure, we are .telegraphing to the Gulf accordingly. a * 1116 Political Agent further suggests that the extra schedule mentioned in Article II, sub-paragraph 1, as/as redrafted, will entail a consequential addition on page 14 of the printed draft lease. This is, however, I think, a misunderstanding. The extra schedule to which reference is niade in Article II sud -paragraph 1 is identical with the existing Second Schedule of the lease, which contains the map, and, as I understand it, what we have in mind is that the map on which the leased areas are shown should also contain the markings relerred to in the redraft of iiruicle 11, suh-paragraph 1. Perhaps you would t)G so kino as to confirm that this is the case? Yours sincerely. &lt;3. Q. LAITHWAITE.p.z.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter P.z.7622/34 of yesterday's date from which it would appear that there is now unanimity in Bahrein concerning Articles I and II. I observe that there is some question concerning compensation wnich has yet to come forward. It is a kinaly action on the part of Colonel- Loch to put the Financial Adviser to the sheikh in a position to discuss at leisure witn the sheikh, the proposed Lease; it is much appreciated hy the Company. I note and confirm that the Lease is to he typed in Bahrein for execution and to he printed in London suosequently at leisure to supply the necessary copies. After very careful consideration I agree with you that there is no need for an extra schedule; it is true that the town of Muharraq is not shewn on the so-called Selection Map which is to constitute the Second schedule to the Lease hut we here think it would be much the best plan to have inset on such plan a small nap shewing the head of the Muharraq Island with the town of Muharraq and its urban boundaries. We are 'telegraphing accordingly to Mr. Davies at Bahrein asking him to see that this is done. It should be quite * ^ simple matter and I think it will be found that it involves/- a - # involves no alteration anywhere. I had thou ^nt at first that to refer to the Map forming the Secona schedule for reference to the boundaries of Muharraq would he misleading as to the area selected; I find this is not so. You may take it, therefore, that I confirm that the extra schedule to which reference is made in Article II 5 suh-paragraph 1 is identical with the existing schedule to the Lease which contains the Map and that what we havein mind is that the Map on which the leased areas are shewn, also contains the markings referred to in the re-draft of Article II, suh-paragraph I.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I refer to^ your letter to me p.Z.7144/34 of the 23rd November. It would seem to tie of question whether the position oi tne Lightship presently intended, aiforcib a direct course leading to tne proposed oiling berth. The position proposed for the Lightship is, as you state, that originally proposed for the Lighthuoy: the former is 6° south of the latter. My instructions are that upon completion of H.M.3# 'Ormonde's' survey, it was decided to place the buoys in the positions they now occupy in order that the vessels inbound to sitrah anchorage could steer a direct course along a 3-mile wide channel from No.l to No.4 (roughly,east of the sitrah anchorage) buoys. There is a distinct advantage to this condition of no turning points since there would be no particular danger if No.2 and No.3 buoys were not seen due to darkness or poor visibility. For ships bound to Sitrah, it would appear to be preferable for the Lightship to be in the position of the No.l buoy. His Majesty' s Admiralty may, however, have chosen the proposed position for the Lightship because it is the most advantageous for vessels entering Manama Harbour. From/■ ' ■ ^ A - * J 4. f0\ * 2 Prom the above it would seem to te preferable that the Lightship he stationed, at the position of the No.l huoy although, as I understand it ? it will serve very well in the position proposed, the only disadvantage heing that vessels inhouna to sitrah may be delayed during times of low visibility. Ihe enclosed Chart Cwhich I would ask you kindly to return) shews at a glance the positions of trie various buoys ana the intended position of the Lightship. I am to ask if it would be possible to place the lightship in a position which would give a direct run-in to the sitrah anchorage without affecting the direct run-in to the Manama anchorage. In the meantime, may we leave the question of the Lightbuoy in abeyance? Yours sincerely, H.S. BALLANTYNE.

This arrangement is designed prmcipaxx/ oo meet an.y emergency that might arise, and it is contemplaLea ordinarily to employ it.II - LOADING &amp; OIL MEASUR3MEMT PROCEDURE Preliminary Steps In loading a tanker, usually two, sometimes possibly only one, of the large oil tanks will be draYm on. _ Thus there vail always be at least one tank which will not be involved in a loading and which may at the time be receiving oil from the field. Prior to loading, a short test run will be made, during which oil will be drawn from one of the tanks and returned to the same tank via the circulating line. The purpose_of this test is primarily to warm up the pump engines at idling speed, to examine the piping for any possible leaks, and to^note pump pressures etc.- generally to ascertain that the plant is in proper operating condition. It also permits a certain amount of stirring up, as it were, of oil in the tank involved and tends to equalize any temperature differences. -^t this time new charts will ce placed on the recording pressure gauge and flow meter,^the instruments wound and set at the correct time and the pens inked. The remote throttle control will be tested and any other tests made to satisfy the operator that the entire system is in order. During or prior to this test the incoming oil stream from the field will be diverted to a tank not to be used in this loading, and water drained from the loading tanks; and before gauges are taken the proper valves at the tanks will be closed and sealed, as explained below. Gauging and Sampling When all is in readiness to commence loading, oil in the shipping tanks will be gauged, sampled and tested for temperature in accordance with the accepted practice, as will the Dilge water 'tank in C8.S0 it contains oil whicti is to 00 run# IiTiin.6dia.t6ly aitsr loading is completed and the pumps are stopped, the tanks are again gauged, and tested for temperature. The various factors upon which computation of the amount of oil shipped depends are recorded at the time they are determined, namely the 'It.ir-'h' and 'low' gauges 5 and the thermome oer, u^ciro meter and centrifuge tube readings. Reading of the steel gauging tapes, and of the instruments referred to, is a comparative ^ simple matter, and when the Shaikh's representative is Present to check the measurement he need only be concerned to see that tne readings are correct, and correctly recorded. Tne correctness of these data being assured, correctness of the result is assured. Computation of the'gross amount of oil withdrawn, determined from difference in gaugee in conjunction with volumetric tables lor(h| the tanks involved, and correction ot 1 such gross amount by reduction to volume at 60° F. and deductions for v/ater and other foreign substances, are arithmetical calculations only which can be carried out, and/or checked, at any time after the | shipment. Sealing of Proper Valves To insure correctness in measurement of oil shipped pre cautions must be taken that (1) no ungauged oil is permitted to enter the pumps during loading operations and that (2) between i gauges no ungauged oil is permitted to enter the tanks from ; which shipments are being made, nor to be withdrawn from these tanks except to the pumps. The above can be safeguarded against provided the following ite valves, which might otherwise permit unintended diversion of oil, are kept closed and sealed during loading operations: i ^t the tank or tanks not used in the current loading : The 16' valve on the suction line, to prevent oil in the tank from draining into that line. The 6' valve on the circulating line, to prevent oil from the field line being diverted to one of the other tanks via the circulation line. The 1' valves in the small bi-pass lines around the above. At the tank or tanks from which current shipment is being mad e: The 8' valve in the incoming line on the field side^of juncture of this line with the circulating line, to prevent oil from the field to enter either the tank or the circulating line. The 1' valve in the small bi-pass line around the above. If there is oil in the bilge water tank when loading is commenced, and if this tank is not to be drawn on or used in the loading, the outlet valve of this tank, also should be closed and sealed. It is incumbent upon the operators, of course, to see that an y valves that would permit wastage of oil, or time, such as 'those in the drainage lines, are kept tightly closed between gauges. Otherwise,' a study of the chart will show that ifnrecau +.ions are taken with respect to the valves _ P ^??oned above/ the opening or closing of other valves in the r not affect the measurement. Hence, the order an s l st l th'-^times at which, such other valves are opened or Sed Sy be left entirely ti the discretion of the operator in charge. or as to the reading^of Ihe'methoS ?o be u^ed^ir sea?ln° U closea valves.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter lo. C/32-10/1 dated 13th January 1935. 2. On the o®6asion of the visit of s.s. 'Rheem' the State Engineer, Mr. W. B. Steele, sealed the valves, made measurements and carried out gauging and sampling tests, in aeoordanee with the memorandum issued by the Bahrain Petro leum Company of which a copy has, 1 believe, been sent to you today attached to the plan of the pipe connections at Sitrah. 3. Before doing this 1 carefully examined the valve system myself and on another occasion 1 and the State Engineer made a further examina tion of the lay out. We are satisfied that the method of operating the valve system precludes the possibility of any oil entering the tanks from which the ship is being loaded, nor can oil be — j' i I m \ It' P \ 1 fsbe diverted (except for ©ireulating purposes) from the sea line. from actual observation and practice 1 am of the opinion that the system of operating is satisfactory and that the diagram provided by the Company is an accurate representation of the lay out. 4. The amount of oil on which royalty is due to the State is 14,976.708 tons after corrections had been made from the results of tests taken, i.e., specific gravity, tem perature and centifruge. 5. Before loading commenced the sealed- off tanks were gauged and the above tests were taken by the State Engineer, representing the Bahrain G-overnment and Mr. Dale Nix representing the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who agreed on their accuracy. When the ship was loaded and pumping had ceased the tanks were again gauged in the same way, the difference in the two readings showed the gross barrells loaded. .Ihe final figure was arrived at after the cor rections which are mentioned above had been made. 6. The following point has arisen which needs a decision if possible before the next tanker arrives. After the ship has been loaded and the sea line has been closed a considerable quantity of oil, on which royalty has been paid, remains in the pipe. It has been suggested by the Company that they should be credited with the royalty on the oil inside the loading line when the next shipment occurs. in principle this —this suggestion appears to me to be reasonable. The actual capacity of the pipe will have to be agreed upon by the two parties and the quantity of oil would be arrived at at a fixed rate. I should be obliged if you would inform me whether you consider that we should agree to this arrangement. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Memorandum, U Your letter Ifo.C/13-10/1, dated the 6th January I appreciate the practical argumeiits which you. put forward for having as Chief Local Representative the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and therefore an American. There is, however, the psychological objection, (and when dealing with Arabs objections of that nature, whether reason able or not from our point of view, must be counted as important) that only recently the Shaikh and his family (vide my Express Letter Ko.C/193, dated the 8th April 1934) express ed strong objecti /ns' to L American Chief Local Representative, a^d I think it would be distinctly impolitic to force an Ancrican upon them. Amongst other objections, being Arabs, ■ k w +11nnic we had done so under American they woula probably txiinK - - pressure, which would be most undesirable. 2.

Personally I have no objection to an American as Chief Local Representative so it really depends on the Shaikh ana his family. As you ^oint out, now that the Mining Lease is sign ed the activities of the Company are more of a commercial ana administrative than a political matter, and if this - as you suggest - were explained to the Shaikh he might withdraw his objections.

I have mentioned to you also that a question would undoubtedly arise one of these days on the displacement of oil from the pipeline by the discharge of ballast water from an incoming tanker. I am told by the Company that such an operation is not likely to happen often; so far as can be foreseen now, it could best be dealt with oy the allowance from the oil measured for royalty of an agreed quantity of oil.

Both the 8 M Incoming line and 16* suction line are connected directly to each tank, while the 6 M circulating line is Joined to the 8 ,! incoming line a few feet from the tank. The 8' line is fitted with a gate valve between the tank and this Junction, and a second gate valve on the opposite side thereof. The 16** line has a gate valve near the tank, while the 6 M line has such a valve near its Junction with the S* line. Short I s3 lines, fitted with valves and check valves, bi- passing the large gate valves in the 6 :i , 8 ,{ and 16' lines, act as a relief for expansion in the larger lines when the large valve® are closed.

Dear Sir: I have for reply your letter No. c /93-10/1 of the 5th of February, 1935. fphe suggestion that an aerial map of Bahrein be prepared was originally made with the thought that it should bs the means by which the Bahrein Government could most quickly and most econo mically complete the survey map of the island which was commenced as a ground survey some time ago. The chief interest of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited was to see this survey map completed in order that privately owned land might be accurately indicated on it. Since the indication of these tracts will be^ the prime use to which the map will be put, the Company recognize that the wish of the Bahrein Government should be the controlling factor in the choice of scale to be used in the preparation of the mosaic. Any scale large enough to show the various tracts, some of which are small, will certainly be large enough to serve any purpose for which The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited might wish to utilize the map.

Dear Sir: fr With their letter PA-160 of January 13, 1935, Uie Baiarein pg-fj^oOompany Limited, sent you a char^ ano. explanation illustrating land describing the Company's facilities on Sitrah Island and methods to be used in measuring and shipping oii• This, i is hopou., nd.~ - pp I any information desired for an understanding of the oil-measurement problem. ' Ihere still remains to be discussed, however, one other operation that may occasionally be required, namely, the procedure o - ioliO..-eu, and the disposition of oil with which the sea loading line is ordinarily to be kept filled, when ships must discharge ballast water asno -e, 1 j\_s now contemplated, this operation will probably rarely be ssary. Obviously, after a ship will have pumped ballast ashore througa the sea loading line the line will be left filled with water Thicn . be taken back aboard when the vessel is loaded with oil; ience Here vu. . be no advantage in discharging ballast unless there may be the ship's tanks than the capacity of the sea line - abou - - •. It is believed that in the majority of cases vessels will be aole_ o -e^c . the anchorage with little or no more than that, amoan- aoo^-.. - not always be possible, however, and when it is d^sc u-g excess to the shore will probably req. -• | The procedure of pumping ballast water through the sea loading line and the MlSst line to the Mlge uater tank at the termxnal by meane of the ships' pumps is a simple one and the only PO\ n \,^ e£ ,f; a consideration is disposition of the oil with ,to«b oases, .,113 he filled. This oil Kill have been measures ^ 01 oil tanks and royalty thereon due • is ' ^ * v. deducted if returned to these tanks the amount of oil so returned must be ae.uo e_ from the current royalty accoun . | Ihe proeedure whieh the Oompany propose to folio,, may be briefly outlined as follows: I As ballast water is pimped through we ttou^the^Iroulat- ^ that P -tieular ahlp.ent. V 1 fpirection of the stream in that manner will continue until all of the oil, ana j. - - - o- ..a gt *, nave been returned, to this tank, whereupon the water stream will be diverted through the ballast line and into the bilge water tank. When discharge of ballast water is completed, atcv 11 be drawn from one of the other oil tanks and pumped. ' ..ans &gt; , 3 lanu pumps through the circulating line, displacing wate ihe same v tank into which oil frcsn the sea line had been placed, whence such water may subsequently be drained off. This entire operation will be completed before gauging of the tanks from which shipment is to be made or before any of the steps in oil measurement described in thememorandum on that subject are taken, /'v I After full and careful consideration, the Company feel that the method above outlined will be the simplest and most practicable one for handling oil displaced from the sea line. Hie only possible objection to the method is that it does not permit a direct measurement of the amount of oil returned to the Sitrah oil tanks nor hence the amount of deduction required in the oil-royalty account. A direct measurement of oil so returned, however, is not necessary in the interests of practicable accuracy, as the volume of the sea loading line can be closely computed by a simple calculation. The length of the pipeline itself, from the 12' valve in the control house to the sea end is 15,975 feet, inclusive of expansion bends, and its internal diameter 11,875 inches. There is also the sea hose, 175 feet in length and 8 inches in internal diameter. The combined capacity of the two can be readily com puted as 2,199,15 U.S. barrels (9,702 cubic inches per barrel,) In order to provide against any possible loss of revenue to His Excellency, however, the Company propose a figure of 2,160 barrels as the assumed amount of oil returned to the tanks when the same is displaced from the sea loading line. It is believed that the amount of 39.15 barrels subtracted from the volume figure above computed will amply provide for (1) a reasonable amount of error, (2) a correction of the computed volume of oil to volume at 60° F. and (3) a small amount of oil that might remain lodged in the pipeline. The Company further suggest an even amount of 294 tons as being the assumed weight of the 2,160 barrels referred to above, as this is approximately the weight of that amount of oil with an A,.. ,1, gravity of 30.9°, which is thought to be a fair average for the Bahrein oil. I The Company propose, therefore, that on occasions when oil in the sea loading line must be returned to the Sitrah oil tanks they follow the procedure outlined above and deduct from the cumulative amount oi oil on which royal ty is currently due to His Sxcellency an amount o 294 tons. snding a pei'iod of observation and trial in actual practice, the Company suggest.- tiiat tne foregoing proposal be agreed upon initially with the unaerstanning tnat either the Company or His Excellency may be free to reconsi ier and re-open the question at any time in the future when it may appear necessary or advisable to either of them.Three copies of this letter are being sent you and the Company retiuest that one copy be forwarded to His Excellency Shaikh sir Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, C. T. 3., C. S. I. Both the actual physical operation at the Terminal and the proposed method of figuring the tonnage of oil to be deducted from the royalty account have been dis cussed with Mr. Belgrave and Mr. Steele and it is thought that they are quite familiar with them. If there is anything which is not entirely clear to you or to them, the Company will be pleased to explain them further at any time. A letter similar to this will be sent to the India Office by Mr. Ballantyne. Yours very truly, J.

As you will see from our letter M.0142/34 of the 12th February 1934, it was recognised, when the position for the lightship was under discussion in January 1934, that there would be every advantage in placing it on the site proposed for the company's outer lightbuoy (Lat. 26° 31' N. Long. 50° E.). # The present tangle seems to have resulted from the fact that when as a result of ORMONDE 'S survey in February 1934, another position, giving the company a better channel, was selected for the outer lightbuoy, the Government of India were left still considering whether or not they would approve of the original proposed position as the site for the lightship and they have in fact just recently decided to approve it. This change in the position of the outer lightbuoy appears to have been made by consultation only among the people on the spot, but in any event we think that Mr. Ballantyne should not be left with the impression, which he seems to have, that the Admiralty are responsible for determining the position of the lightship and that it should be made clear to him that we merely acted in a consultative capacity, the responsibility resting with the Government of India, as the lighting and buoy ing/ Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E., India Office.I)^-y ~ ci •» tiuoyins authority for the Gulf. As Xor solving the difficulty which he has raised, we suggest that the lightship should he moored in 9f fathoms in Lat. 26° 35* N. Long. 50° 58' E. position marked on his chart which is returned herewith). This would leave the company with a straight channel to the oiling herth at sitrah (which they seem entitled to expect) and would he equally suitable for ships making the Bahrein anchorage; and it would have the further advantage that it falls within the limit of the detailed chart No.3790, which the present position of the light- iDUoy does not do. If this proposal is agreeable to the company I presume you will bring it to the notice of the Government of India.

Sorae time ping to the Bahrein Govormaemt as a rapid and eeonoiiic means for them to eaiplete a suinrey of the Island which had been conmanced on the ground mm®time before. ' Mle the possibility of making such a map was taken up with the Royal Mr Force as a result of this suggestion, our personal interest must be considered quite secondary as our need for such a map is not great, certainly much less than the Government's. Since the Job is really being done for the Govern lent and they .'ill pay for it, with the Company assisting by par ticipating in the payment to some extent, said since the map must be of sufficient size to meet the Governments requirements before it can be of much use to either of us, it seems that the decision as to scale, method used, etc., must rest with them. I discussed this with Colonel Loch last evening end ho ho es to go over it with ir. 13elgrave today ana will then write you their contdwsions. There are a few points on ^lich I should like additional infor mation hov/ever. Your letter mentions 'photographs.' It is your plan, is it not, to deliver to the Bahrein Oovemraent and to us one complete mosaic each, matched and copied? A more file of individual prints Bould be of little use to either them or us I am afraid, '••ill it be possible to obtain additional mosaics and individual contact prints if they are de sired?

Mr. Belgrave has very definite ideas as to the use to which he wish®# to put the resulting sap or maps and, because of that, he my have in mind some quite definite specifications. would it not be desirable to have a complete discussion or at least an exchange of correspondence giving complete details or, on your side, vSiat you ai.'e equipped to do, and, on his, what he requires?

P pqhi Colonel Loch's despatch intinBtin^ the signature of the Mining Lease I note that one small ♦ alteration in the draft was made hy mutual consent. The alteration in question is that the north-east corner of the sheikh's house, instead of the centre of the house, was taken as the centre of the Green Circle arawn at Sakhir. The Political Agent remarks that this corner is clearly defined and unlikely to he .^changed and it would have heen inappropriate to have had to endeavour to fix a centre in the sheikh's house itself. 3, on a further point, you will have seen that hy agreement between the representatives of the Company and the authorities in Bahrein, the date 'a9th'/Say of December 19347 has now been inserted in Article XXIII on/ H.R» Ballantyne, Esq.., Bahrein Petroleum Go.

Ballantyne, I write in confirmation of our conversation this morning to say tiiat we have discussed, with the Admiralty the point raised in your letter to me of 20th December at)out the Lightship. 2. The position which the Government of India have proposed for the Lightship is identical with the site originally proposed for the company's outer light- huoy - Latitude ae^l' N. Longitude 50 o 59i' E 5 and it is one which the Admiralty regarded as offering every advantage when the c^uestion was under discussion in January 1934. But since that date a different position- 6 degrees North ? so far as I can see3 o -l the pooition originally proposed - appears to have been selected for the outer lighthuoy as the result of local discussion. 3/ Ballantyne, E sq ., Bahrein petroleum Co. Lta., 19 3 M)orgate, E.G. 2.3. The Government ol' India are^ of course, the responsible lighting and buoying authority, and it would tie necessary to discuss any alteration of the position of the lightship with them. The Aamiralty have, however, suggested that, unless the Government of India see difficulty ahout this, it should he possible to meet the point which you have raised by mooring the lightship in 9i fathoms at Latitude ^6°35' N. Longitude E. We are not really in a position to say here whether any hitch is likely to arise over such a location and we shall have tO' consult the Government of India® But before we take the matter up with them perhaps you would be so kina as to confirm try understanding that a location such as the Admiralty suggest, if the Government of India see no objection to it, would meet the point which the Company have raised?

BAHREIN PETROLEUIvI COMPANY LIMITED, 19, MOORGATE, LONDON, E.G. 2, 28th February 1935* Oil Measurement. Dear Mr.Laithwaite, As I think I have warned you would be the case* after approval of the Company's oil measurement system at the Sitrah Terminal, comes the question - What procedure is to be followed and what disposition is to be made of oil with which the sea—loading line (from the Terminal to the Anchorage) is to be kept filled when ships discharge ballast water ashore? As now contemplated, t his operation will probably X 'arely be necessary. Obviously, after a snip will have pumped ballast ashore through the sea-loafllng line the line will he left filled with water which must he taKen hack aboard when the vessel is loaaed with oil; hence there will be no advantage in discharging ballast unless there may be more water in the ship's tanks than the capacity of the sea line - about 2,800 barrels. It is believed that in the majority of cases vessels will be able to reach the anchorage with little or no more than that amount aboard. This may not always be possible, however, and when it discharge of the excess to the shore will probably be required. , The/ Laithwaite Esq.-, G.I«E., India Office, Whitehall-, &amp;.¥.!•2. The procedure of pumping ballast water through the sea- loading line and the 'ballast line to the bilge water tank at the terminal by means of the ships' pumps is a simple one and the only point that requires particular consideration is disposition of the oil with which the sea line, in most cases, will be filled. This oil will have been measured out of the Sitrah oil tanks and royalty thereon due to His Excellency accounted for; hence if returned to these tanks the amount of oil so returned must be deducted from the current royalty account. The procedure which the Company propose to follow may be briefly outlined as follows:- As ballast water is pumped through the sea line from the ship, pushing the oil shoreward, the latter will be directed through the circulating line into the oil tank not_ to be drawn on in that particular shipment. Direction of the stream in that manner will continue until all of the oil, and possibly a small amount of water, have been returned to this tank, whereupon the water stream will be diverted through the ballast line and into the bilge water tank. When discharge of ballast water is completed, about 50 barrels of oil will be drawn from one of the other oil tanks and pumped by means of the land pumps through the circulating line, displacing water left in this line into the same tank into which oil from the sea line had been placed, whence such water may subsequently be drained off. This entire operation will be completed, before gauging of the tanks from which shipment is to be made or before any of the steps in oil measurement described in the Company's memorandum on that subject are taken* After full and careful consideration, the Company feel that the method above outlined will he the simplest and most practicable one for handling oil displaced from the^sealine. The only possible objection to the method is that it does not permit a direct measurement of the amount of oil returned to the Sitrah oil tanks nor hence the amount of deduction required in the oil-royalty account. A direct measurement of oil so returned, however, is not necessary in the interests of practicable accuracy, as the volume of the sea loading line can be closely computed by a simple calculation. The length of the pipeline itself, from the 12' valve in the control house to the sea end is 15,975 feet, inclusive of expansion bands, and its internal diameter 11.875 inches. There is also the sea hose, 175 feet in length and 8 inches in internal diameter. The combined capacity of the two can be readily computed as 2,199.15 U.S. 'barrels (9,702 cubic inches per barrel). In order to provide against any, possible loss of revenue to His Excellency, however, the Company propose a figure of 2,160 barrels as the assumed amount oi oil returned to the tanks when the same is displaced from the sea loading line. It is believed that the amount oi 39.10 barrels subtracted from the volume figure above computed will amply provide for (l) a reasonable amount of error, (2) a correction of the computed volume of oil to volume at 60° F. and (3) a small amount of oil that might remain lodged ir^the pipeline. The Company further suggest an even amount of 294 tons as being the assumed weight of the 2,160 'barrels referred to above, as this is approximately the weight of that amount of oil with an A.F.I, gravity of 30.9°, which is thought to be a fair average for the Bahrein oil* +b^-p^-fn-pe.• that on occasions when The Company propose*,, thereiore, mao ox ~ j-ir,,-, line must be returned to the Sitrah oil in the sea -loading ime mu^ oil/oil tanks they follow the procedure outlined above and deduct troin the cumulative amount of oil on which royaltv is currently due to His Excellency an amount of 294 tons. Pending a period of observation and trial in actual practice, the Company suggest that the foregoing proposal he agreed upon initially with the understanding that either the Company or His Excellency may he free to reconsider and re-open the question at any time in the future when it may appear necessary or advisable to either of them. A letter similar to the foregoing has been sent r li already to His Excellency through the medium of the ' L'' f •J* Company's Chief Local Representative in Bahrein. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) H.R.

As I mentioned to you on Friday last, the Company find from their experience that it is necessary to have a light huoy in the position now occupied by Dumb-huoy Mo.4 in the Sitrah Channel. As I understand it, the reason for this is that it is essential for tankers to he ahle to come in at night time. It .is hoped that the Admiralty will see no object ion to this re-adjustment of the buoys. Assuming that it does not, may the Company ask that the Government of India arrange for dumb buoy No.4 to oe replaced by a light buoy at the time the Lightship is placed in position? The question then arises as to what light buoy should be used. The present light buoy is a second-hand one which replaced tne light buoy originally in position If the present light buoy is suitable the Company would have no objection to buying it, otherwise the Company would like to have a new light buoy supplied, if possible by the Government of India. It is assumed that the arrangements already made for the maintenance of the light buoy in its present position would apply to the maintenance of the light buoy in its new position but as to this no ooubt you will kindly let me know.

Mr. Belgrave, whose interest in the completed job is at least as great as that of the Company, was also present. As a whole, the work is quite good considering the time spent on it and the map should prove quite useful. There are, however, great variations in the definiteness and detail in different portions of the map. This is especially true in the northern section where one poor strip extending from north to south across the entire section is very obvious. Inspection also shows other quite indistinct areas in the same general section. If this strip and the other areas could be re placed with clearer prints, which it is realized might entail the making of new negatives, such changes would greatly improve the appearance and the utility of the completed map. Another criticism which the Company have to offer is on the method of mounting. The cardboard on which the prints have been pasted is not at all stiff enough. Large rolls have already appeared on the surface and they will, of course, increase with time. It would have been oetter in all ways if the mounting had been done on some stiffer medium such as one of the many prepared building boards like Beaver Board or Coiapo Board, While the Company realize that it may be too late to do anything to correct either of the points mentioned they would appreciate it if you would refer their criticisms to the attention of tiie Roval Air Force and will be pleased to be advised of their coinments.
