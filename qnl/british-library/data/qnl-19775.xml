To The Hon'ble Mr..D. de S. Bray, C.I.E.,C.B,E.&gt;I.C.S., Foreign Secretary to th'- Government of India in the Foreign an Political Department, DELHI. Subject:- Abu Musa and Hormuz Oxide. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department No. 2409-S dated 17th October to the 0 Secretary of State regarding the Abu Musa Oxide question, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a translated extract from the Tehran Newspaper 'I'ihan' No. 75 dated 8th September 192.1 on the subject of the oxide at Hormuz. It seems evident that the Newspaper believed that an American Company is trying to get concession for the Hormuz Oxide; if one does it will become more necessary for British firms to use the Abu Musa oxide, and it is evidently urgently necessary to close the Wonckhaus» case in regard to it. The extract also shows what ridiculous ideas regarding the quantity and value of the oxide are prevalent even among educated people at Tehran, and it shows also that the paper is in complete ignorance of the fact that large quantities of oxide exist at Abu Kusa and other places besides Hormuz. I am sending a copy of this letter, unofficially, to the India Office to save time. 1 have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- A.P.Trevor, Lieut-Col., Political Resident in the Persian &amp;ulf.Extract from the Persian Paper w lIHAN* No* 75 of the 8th September 1921 printed and published in Tehran# do i t \\ Some tine ago an American Company sent a telegram to Wakil-or-Eoays of ITamdan for the purchase of red ochre (fex- ide) in the Hormuz Island, which is almost the only red \ 5 ochre mine in the whole world find which is an indispen- sible port of call to all vessels. According to a* report received by us the British came to Imow about this telegram, and bought from the Minister of public affairs, about 70,000 tons or lbs at the rate of £ 3 per ton payment to be made in cash before shipping ochre in quantities gradually® Having settled this affairs \ so far they sent the file relating to this business to \ \ the Ministry, Wakar-os-Saltaneh was surprised at this^ irregular act on their part and at the back of the file 'This affair has not been given due consideration yet' and then^it in to the Minister 1 s office. Later on, some enthusiasts, heard of this and hastened to visit the Head of Government' i.e. Prime Minister whom they informed of that had come to pass. He stated that he had no knowledge of this business. In accordance with information lately received by us the Prime llinister has issued written orders that concession for red ochre should not be giveb to the British firm STRUCK, but to the American Concern who had originally communicated with the Wakil-or-Roays. Comments by the papen- If you have no knowledge of the red ochre Mine, please make enquiries from those who know, if we had a proper Hinistry of Public Affairs, the Govern ment could obtain two million tomans from this one soured every year. \ \ \ ■■«^ //I? /'V ou &lt;mPA Hy, L ondon, G i.a.sgo^ and momammewai' M anaging A c^wts ?ICK.

Dorabjijthe local a^ent for Prank btrick ^ Co., has beon confidentially directed to ascertain whether it would 'be possible for the Company to obtain the Red Oxide Concession on Abu Musa in the event of their bein^j unable to get a new contract for Hormuz. During the past year they ^ave been shipping oxide from Hormuz mined for them under their old contract, which apparently expired during the war (? in 1915) but coald not be completed owing to shipping difficul ties. Some oxide is still awaiting shipment at Hormuz in virtue o^ the old contract. The Persian Government are apparently not disposed to offer Strick a fresh contract, but wish to solicit terrdfrars, and hope to ^et a better offer from America. Strick wish to get the Hormuz contract agnAi, as the Hormuz oxide is of superior quality,but want to ascer tain the position at Abu Musa in case they fail to get the Hormuz contract.

Dear Sir Arnold, Many thanks for your letter of 13th ult., enclosing copy of letter received 'by you from the Residency, Bushire, which I have perused with much interest. Owing to the lateness of the Season, I have decided not to send a boat to load at Ahu I!usa until the Autumn. Reading between the lines, I presume that there will be no difficulty in ny shipping the old stock as well as the newly mined Oxide, it being understood that if the old stock realises a price that leaves a decent margin of profit, after paying freight and charges, I shall make some fair allowance to the man Isa, who, I understand, had some interest with the late concessionnaire Abdullah bin Hassan Samaiyeh* I had already heard from our Agents at Teheran tnat the Hoin -ut -Tojjar was 'pulling the strings' with the view of getting the Persian Government to put forward a claim to the Island of Abu Musa, but I had not taken it very seriously, seeing that, many years ago they put forward a similar claim and so far as* my memory serves me the British Government then finally decided that the Island belonged to the Sheikh of Shargah, which decision, I presume, they will adhere to. With kind regards. Yours sincerely, Sd. Illegible. . i ^1son, K.O•I .E., etc*, Mohammerah*Jo.22* of 1985.

If so, has the oxide obtained there proved up to the anticip- -ated standard both in quantity and quality ?

Sir, ■ 111^ • With reference to your memoranduEa No. 548-S dated the 23rd Bepteiaber, 1924, I have the honour to report what follows for the inforraation of the Hon'hle the Resident in the Persian Gulf. A few days prior to my assuming charge here in April last year, Mr. Hahakkuk who was at Ahu Musa applied for permission to Tisit Hallul and Sir A'bu Nuair, and this was accorded in Colonel Knox's telegram No. 386 of the 23rd April,1923. then &lt;x.y Mr. Hahakkuk, who was/furnished '.vith 'Letter of /?«commendation H to the Residency Agent, visited the ahovo mentioned places. Nothing is further known 'both to the Consulate and also to Messrs Frank Strick's local agent of his subsequent operations in Ahu Musa Island. Mr. Hahakkuk came to Bandar Al/bas in the latter part of July ,1923 during my absence on tour, and stayed with Mr. Dorahji. He sail&lt;S(i for home in one of Messrs. Frank Strick and Company^on August 6th,1923, when I was in Karachi on recess. This Consulate was not aware of Mr. Hahukkuk's movements nor did that gentleman call during his stay here. This( 2 ) This would account for tho fact of his departure not having 'been reported at the time, and the omission is much Messrs. 'Dorahji and Co: inform me that there is a fairly large auantity of mined Bed Oxide lying at Ahu Musa since 1914, hut no fresh mining has 'been undertaken. As reported in my telegram No. 439 dated the 27th e*. March, 1924 there has 'been no report of Oxide from Abu ^us&lt; since January,1922. In April last. 20-tons of the Ahu Musa product was brought to Bandar Ahhas and shipped as a sample to London per s^s.P.raunfels (vide News Diary Vo. 17 for the period ending the 30th April, 1924). regretted.

Strick &amp; Co., Ltd., London, to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (File 76/5). We 'beg to refer to your letter of 2nd September, addressed to our Basra friends, more especially to the second paragraph thereof, which relates to Abu Musa. It is correct that Mr. Habakkuk has left the Island; in fact, he arrived at Bandar Abbas on 10th June last year, having been on the Island since March 8th, and, since his departure, no further exploratory work has been conducted, the reason being that, after a very thonough investigation, our Engineer came to the conclusion that the Oxide obtainable on the Island was in no way to be compared wit h^ that m i ned at O rm uz^ We have disposed of approximately 20 tons only, as a trial lot, out of the 6/800 tons which has been mined, and this small parcel cost us over £.2. per ton to bring it to Bunder Abbas for shipment. We do not see the remotest prospect of disposing of any appreciable further quantity, and have reluctantly come to the conclusion that, while Ormuz Oxide is obtainable, the market for Abu Musa Oxide is practic- -ally nil. The difficulties of shipment and labour are so great that it is not feasible to send steam^ers to the Island, and the expense of transport to Bandar Abbas is prohibitive as indicated above. We have already spent over £.2100 in exploratory work, but, although it will turn out a serious loss for us, we need scarcely state that we shall carry out the terms of the concession granted to us by the Sheikh of Shargah.Extract paragraph 70 from Bandar Abbas Diary No. 3, dated the 12th February 1925, 80 tons of Tied Oxide of Iron from Abu Musa, were loaded here on the 6th February on the S.S.

I am confident however that no contraband is dumped on these islands. Boa^. (comparatively few) only shelter there in rough weather. M.Stas openly asserts that Revenue super tax combined with compounded road- tax is killing ligitirnate trade in these commo dities . Many of the biggest merchants of Bushire are notoriously interested in smuggling. It is rumoured that landings are even made at night near Reshire. j Small preventive posts (one Collector with two soldiers) are bribed; the garrison at Bushire is too weak. Tangistanis are said to have threatened to massacre the crews of preventive launches. In these circumstances it is anticipated that the Persian Government will recognise in time that their super tax is a osix mistake. Even if there is a decrease of imports from India to Persian ports and a corresponding increase to Dibai and Bahrain, the problem affects Bersia only adversely. Her difficulty is ag gravated by non-recognition of status of Arab Sates and reluc tance to negotiate with them through H.M's Government. /I Addressed Government of India, repeated to Tehran.

Tehran, May 31, 1926. \-^ I HAVE the honour to transmit to you, with reference to my despatch No. 001 of the 19th November last, copy of a telegram received on the 29th May from His Majesty's Resident and consul-general at Bushire, and of my reply thereto of the 30th May, with regard to the Island of Abu Musa. 2. It is desirable to place on record a connected account of what has happened in this regard since my above-mentioned despatch, in which I informed you that I did not intend to take any action, unless the question of Abu Musa were raised by the Persian Government.' On the receipt of despatch No. 11/85 S of the 6th March last from Colonel Prideaux, copy of which is enclosed herein, I decided that in view of the official' statement by the Director of Customs at Bushire, as therein recorded, that Abu Musa was regarded as belonging to the Persian Government by the Ministry of the Interior, a representation to the Persian Government was necessary. I therefore handed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd April copies of mv aide-memoire of the 16th May, 1923, and my letter to the Persian Prime Minister of the 26th May, 1923 (see my despatch No. 236 of the 29th May, 1923), and explained that I felt it necessary to remind the I ersian Government of what had passed three years ago in view of the incident created by the attempt of the customs to fetch samples of oxide from Abu Musa, and the subsequent assertion by the customs director at Bushire, on the authority of the Ministry ot the Interior of Persian rights over Abu Musa which, as his Excellency was well aware, His Majesty's Government were unable to admit. Sir Davood Meftah verified the fact that the originals of these communications were in the files of the Ministry tor Foreign Affairs, and suggested that it might be well it copies of them were communicated personally ^to the Minister of the Interior together with an explana tion of the circumstances in which the question oi Abu Musa had been resuscitated. T agreed to do this, and instructed the oriental secretary to see the Minister ot the Interior on my behalf. Mr. Havard obtained an interview with Dadgar (formerly known as Adl-ul-Mulk) on the 27th April, and, when handing him the copies, said that he was not asking for a reply or for an expression of the views of the Persian Government, but was merely bringing the documents to his notice as they explained the views of His Majesty's Government as regards Abu Musa. It was to be hoped, Mr. Havard added, that the status quo ante would be left as it was j i • 0 3 As my personal relations with Dadgar are excellent and 1 have found him a reasonably-minded man, I confidently anticipated that this comnunucat.on would bury the question, especially as Dadgar promised to study the dossier of the qu^jon both in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and in his own Department, if one existed there I was therefore antonished and concerned at receiving Bushire teteg™™ No. 63 with its report of a fresh assertion by the local Director of Customs of Persian nroprietarv rights over Abu Musa, on the authority of the Ministry of the Interioi The fact that M. Stas had acted under instructions from the Administrator-General of Customs, M. Molitor, who is a very sober official with a good understanding o international proprieties, made the matter seem all the worse 4. Immediately on the receipt of the telegram I therefore teiephoned for an interview with Sir Davood Meftah, who received me at noon on the 29th May. t read to him the Bushire telegram and expressed my amazement and concern at^ts mutents' the natural interpretation which anyone, I said, woulfi place on tnis telegram was that the Persian Government, notwithstanding the reminder a month . •lo-o^made to them of the 1923 correspondence, were asserting their claim to \bu Musa Nevertheless in view of the friendly relations between the two Govern ments I could hlrdly believe that this was the case, and hoped there was some misunderstanding ^ warned his Excellency privately that, if there were no mismulerstandin' the onlv course for me would he to request the Government S to SS'a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of [1321 x—4]Shargah. Sir Davood said he could offer no explanation at all; the Government, so far as he was aware, had taken no further steps in the matter, and the only thing to do was for him at once to go and see the Minister of the Interior and find out what had happened. 1 suggested that 1 should go with him, which he accepted, and we thereupon visited Dadgar, who sent for his Under-Secretary, and held a meeting with them in the offices of the Council of Ministers. Dadgar likewise expressed his astonishment and told me (1) that no instructions had been issued since Mr. Havard had made to him the communication reported above; (2) that the Persian Government had no present intention whatever of raising the question of the status of Abu Musa. The only explanation he could suggest was that the 'avis previously expressed by the Minister of the Interior regarding the ownership of the island and on which M. Delcroix's letter of the 4th January last (see Bushire despatch No. 11/85S) had been based, had wandered round the devious and often obstructed channels of the finance bureaux and reached M. Stas in the form of an instruction, without reference to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Dadgar further stated that his Department, of course, had nothing to do with questions of territorial rights, which belong to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Government as a whole; he promised to try and trace the origin of this instruction to M. Stas, in consultation with his competent colleagues, and to acquaint me with the result through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I accepted this assurance and expressed the hope that he would find means to put a stop to this official assertion of a Persian claim to Abu Musa, which was now on official record in the archives of the Bushire consulate-general, and could not remain unchallenged, unless withdrawn. Dadgar said that he agreed with this idea, and would see how the 'circulation ' of the Persian pretention could be stopped. 5. As I was still puzzled by the intermediary in the matter of the Administrator-General of Customs, t called on M. Molitor later in the day, and explained the whole matter to him. The chronology of events is as follows :— A letter was received on the 6th Dey Mah, 1304 (the 27th December, 1925) in the Ministry of Finance from the Ministry of the Interior expressing the opinion that Abu Musa was Persian territory. This was quoted in a letter from the Administrator-General to the Bushire customs director of the 31st Ordibehesht, 1305, which evidently provoked the last letter to Colonel Prideaux from M. Stas.. This communication was, however, sent to M. Stas by M. Dekerokheer, without it having been shown to M. Molitor. Meanwhile, M. Molitor, in ignorance of this communica tion, had written to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 24th Ordibehesht (the 15th May, 1926) enquiring whether Persian rights were established over the Islands of Abu Musa and Tamb. The whole matter therefore seems to have arisen out of faulty liaison between Persian Government Departments, aided perhaps by an indiscretion on the part of M. Dekerokheer. M. Molitor was as a matter of fact unaware of the position in regard to Abu Musa, and what had happened in that connection both in 1904 and 1923. I have now completely enlightened him, and I think that henceforth the Customs Administration will be very careful not to get further involved in the matter. M. Molitor feels convinced that M. Stas himself had serious doubts about Persian rights over Abu Musa, and deliberately wrote his letter to Colonel Prideaux in order to have a good reason for not taking steps at Abu Musa pending Colonel Prideaux's reply. In any case, M. Molitor telegraphed on the evening of the 30th May instructing M. Stas to take no further steps in Abu Musa or Tamb pending the receipt of a reply from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the letter of the 24th Ordibehesht. Later in the evening of the 30th May I had an opportunity of seeing Dadgar and Sir Davood Mettah at a reception given by the League of Nations Opium Commission. They both told me that the Persian Govern ment were not going to press this question, and that they had sanctioned the despatch of M. Molitor's telegram above referred to as an issue out of the embarrassment which had arisen. I told Sir Davood that I should have to cause some reply to be returned by Colonel Prideaux to M. Stas letter, but that it would be civil and not provocative of further discussion. I expressed again to both Persian gentlemen the hope that this question should be allowed to sleep, and both asserted me that so far as they were concerned if certainly would be. Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Government of India and to His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE.Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Colonel Prideaux to Sir P.

I have taken up matter energetically and personally with Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of Interior and Administrator-General of Customs, and will record the rather involved details in a despatch. Meanwhile, it will suffice to say that a misunderstanding has arisen due to imperfect liaison between Persian Government Departments; that I feel confident that I can prevent matter going any further . and that Administrator-General is telegraphing to-day to Director of Customs, Rushire, not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb pending reply from Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding status of those islands. Minister of Interior told me that Persian Government had no present intention of raising question of ownership of Abu Musa. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Colonel Prideaux to Sir P. Loraine. (No. 11/85 S.

My Lords understand that the 3haikh has been in the habit of visiting the island from time t® time and is recognised as ruler by the few regular inhabitants. Persian pretensions to ownership of the island were apparently put forward in 19u4 but withdrawn almost imrne- ♦.diately as the result of representations by His Lajesty 's Government. ..y Lords are of opinion that it would be extremely damaging to British prestige on the Trucial coast, an:; in the Gulf generally, if these claims, which have no doubt been revived as a consequence of the forward policy adopted under the regime of the new 3hah, were not now to be-firmly opposed. a* copy of this letter .has been sent to the i ; oreig' Office and India Office.

THE SECRETARY TO THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF, BRITISH RESIDENCY &amp; CONSULATE GENERAL, BUS HIRE. PERSIAN GULF. Sir, Referring to our letter of the I9th inst., we have the honour to inform you that, after consulting with the gentle man who is, probably, the leading authority in this country on the subject, we have come to the conclusion that it would be desirable if our Concession, in respect of Abu Musa, could be renewed for another year or so, if this could be done on a much lower basis of consideration. We take the liberty of enclosing, for your perusal, an extract from the letter wherein the authority, referred to above, gives us his considered views on the subject&gt; v/hich we think, possibly, will be of'interest to you, and v»e shall be greatly obliged if you would, at your convenience, let us know whether the Sheikh of Shargah would be disposed to renew the Concession, say, for two years, i.e. 31st December, 1929, in consideration of our paying him a nominal amount of Rs.500 per annum. Of course, in the event of our being successful in dis posing of the Mineral at the rate of more than 1,000 tons per annum, as provided for in the original Agreement, we should be quite willing to pay tjie Sheikh Rs.2 per ton royalty, on any-2- THR S^HRETARY to the political ihhi ^ LKI TH^ H^JJW GULF 26th OCT. 1927. quantity, exported in excess ol l t OOO tons per annum, r We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servants, For FRANK STRICK &amp; CO., LTD. / (ENC)ABU MUSA ORE. By your favour of the 18th inst., you kindly invite our opinion as to the prospects we can hold out for Abu Musa Ore, and whether, in our considered view, those prospects would justify your continuing the control of this Ore. In reply we are most ready to give every response in our power to your-question hereupon, hut, unfortunately, the lapse of time since the receipt by us of the some 100 tons ex the S/o 'TABARTSTAN' is too short for us to venture upon any defin ite statement, for, as - and in the Oxide World, this latter day shipment of Abu Musa Ore may be regarded as such - is a question of time, running into many months, and even two years or more; in fact, it takes us the best part of half a year to submit a sample and receive reply from Customers in some parts of the World. In this way we explain that, so far we have really effect ed but little business in the 'TABAKISTAN' parcel, and thus have no real facts upon which to base an estimate as to the ton nage the World's Markets are good for. All we can, so far, ao is to venture an opinion based upon our own judgment of the merits of this Oxide, wnich is, that Iat the price last quoted and in the quality last supplied, there should be a real and progressive use for Abu Musa Ore. 'It undoubtedly has attractions for its full depth of shade is not, in our experience attainable by any means at an economic al cost, and, by this, we mean that it should, in our judgment, merit an opening by virtue of its own characteristics at its price, although this does not mean t hat it could evei encioach upon the field held by Ormuz Red, against which latter Abu Musa is distinctly inferior; None-the-less Abu Musa has theattraction of a specially dark and good hue of its own, and fills a gap no other Qxid^ could fill at its price, and, our recorrmendation is that you, at any rate, retain the control for a period of a further year or thereabouts, within which time it should be possible to know what response this Oxide is meeting with, and likely to extend to. The price fixed for the '3/3 'T^BARISTAH' parcel was 70/- per ton, and If It were poeslhle to amend that to 6C/- per ton, we should say that reasonable business should. In due course, develop, although we consider It will take some one or tv.o years before these sales could be expected to reach 1000/2000 tons per annum. Much time Is lost in the ^aide-work of introducing a product, but once introduced, we do consider this Oxide is likely to be adopted for regular use, and progressively so. Vie just wish we could speak more definitely, but hope you will understand that, at this juncture, it is not possible to us to do so. nr.T. 21st. 1927.made Please Fee the two letter? from Messrs. !

The matter may be discussed with the Shaikh when the P.R. visits Shargah. The question is of interest to us as the ^ maintenance of Shaikh Abdrr Rahman of Hairah, — a political prisoner in Aden, is paid out of the royalties received from the rea oxide conces sion. 11' tfK' i ■7* rw 6 £ No.T ^ * of 1927. 3.3.'Ghakdara' Sohar, Srd Decem'ber 1927.

The ahovementioned agreement will terminate on the 1st January 1928. As the quality of the oxide of Ahu Kusa Island is not so good as the Company had hoped, they are only prepared to renew the agreement on very reduced terms, that is, on payment of Ils.500/- a year V* or Rs.2/- per ton if the amount of oxide extracted — exceeds 1000 tons.

Strick's concession expired at the end of last year. They want it renewed for a period of two years only on payment of ^ Es. 500/- per annum ( and usual royalty) instead of the £s. 2000/- per annum they have 'been paying, as they do not attach much value to the concession. The matter was taken up when you were off the Trucial Coast in December last and in reply to the Residency Agent's communic- -ation giving Stric^s terms the Shaikh of Shargah has stated that he wants 1,500/- per I annum and if Strick's did not wish to pay it they could retire from the field and he woul m try to find another market. The Residency Agent commenting said that the Shaikh would prohahly accept 1,000. On#fact struck me on a hasty perusal of the papers and that is that neither the Residency Agent nor the Shaikh of Shargah have 'been informed that Strick's wanted a ' — n i ■ - - i i 1 renewal only f or two years. Knowledge of this may induce the Shaikh to change his mind, 'but in any case I think he ought to know as he must he counting on a extension for five years. Residency Agent may he asked to inform the Shaikh and report again. We can then write to Strick &amp; Go.

A copy of my letter as well as the Shaikh's ansv/er to me is forwarded herewith for your information. I have also asked him verbally to agree to what you had mentioned in your letter hut his answer was the same as he had written in his letter. The Shaikh of Shargah has remarked in'his letter that if the Strick Company have that the oxide ^r was^of a good quality they shoultL leave it and he may 'be permitted 'by you to sell it to anyone who may ask for it. In my opinion it is not advisable to give permission to the ' ■— ' ' , 1 Shaikh to 3-0^ as h 0 i 3 empty handed and some of the Persian merchants who have got 'business relations with some foreign companies may get the concession secretly from him. It v/ould he advisable if an arrangement would he made with the Strick Company to pay the Shaikh Ps.1000/- annum in t advance. I hope I will he excused if my opnion is not approved 'by you. fi Letter No.10/- dited 17th Sajab 1346 (11-1-28) from TUe Hesidenoy Agent, Shargah, to the Shaikh of Shargah. A..0. I 'beg to inform you that T have received a letter No.68, dated the 3rd December 1927, regarding the previous contract which the Strick Company made on the 1st January 1923 with the Shaikh of Shargah for the exportation of red oxide from Abu Husa Island. The?y then agreed to pay the Shaikh Ps.2000/- on condition that the quality of^v 0 &lt;LJi oxide exported not exceed 1000 tons, 'but if it exoeedei tliat amount they had to pay .2/- for every additional ton. The period of that contract will expire on the 1st January 1928 and as the oxide of Ahu Musa is not so good as the Company had expected, therefore,, they are now- prepared to renew the contract at lesser terms, that is, they intend to pay lis.500/- only per annum or Tls.2/- per ton if the quality of oxide which is exported exceeds 1000 tons. I hope that you will put this matter under your consideration. In my opini on, if the oxide of Ahu Husa wa s good t he Strick Company would have jiojb^a sk^ed for reduction. I advise you to agree to this as a small thing which may last long is better than a 'big thing which may not last long. I await your reply. Letter dated 19th Rajah 1346 (13-1-23) from Shaikh Sultan Mn Saqar, Chief of Shargah, to the 'Residency Agent, Shargah. A.C. On the 19th Hajah I received your letter of the 17th Kajah 1346 (11-1-28) and was acquainted with its contents. You had especially remarked that in the agreement which was made 'between us and the Strick Company the latter agreed to pay a sum of 'Rs.2000/- per annum and 'Rs-2/- for every additional ton of oxide that may he exported 'by them. As we could not disohey '^.B.F's Government we agreed to the terms and acted according to the wish of Colonel Trevor, the Political Resident, otherwise we could have got Rs.5/- to ?/- per ton. Now if the Company see that the oxide would 'be of no use to them they should leave it and I may he allowed to sell to another Company. Rs.50.0/- per annum is too little, 'but if at any rate they v/ant to renew the contract I will reduce Rs«500/- for the sake of the G-overnment and agree to Rs.1500/- per annum and Rs.2/- for every additional ton.This is my reply and I hope you will always please me with the news of your welfare. tj.e.Confidential No 2S0-S.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.19 dated the 25th January 1928, T am directed 'by the Hon'hle the Political Resident to request you to please v/rite to the Shaikh of Shargah informing him that Messrs Strick &amp; Co. Ltd. have now replied that they are unahle on the terms offered 'by the Shaikh to entertain a renewal of the concession to mine red oxide from Ahu Musa Island as the oxide is, in their opinion, not sufficiently saleable to warrant their interesting themselves therein to any further extent. In the circumstances the Hon'hle the Political Resident would 'be glad to know if the Shaikh is now agreeable to accept the Co * s latest offer of which he is already aware i.e. Bs.SOO/- per annum and usual royalty of Es.2/- on every ton of oxide in excess of 1000 tons extracted. In case, however, the Shaikh is still unwilling to give out the concession on these terms or Messrs Strick Co eventually fail to avail themselves of the concession on any terms, I am at the same time to request you to write and enquire from the Shaikh the names, nationality. i general status and other particulars available of any ^ .... ^ BW-i- .- r ri . ^ markets for the oxide definitely offered to or contempla- ^— ted 'by him.

A. 0. y f 2/J * Tith reference to your letter No.164 dated ^th August 1928 regarding the oonoession of Ahu ^Tusa Island for Eed Oxide. I as directed 'by Tour T Ionour wrote a letter to the Shaikh o^ Shargah under No.437 dated 12th Eabi I, 1547 (28th August 1928) on the lines of Tour Honour's letter. I attach a copy of my letter for your information. In addition to my letter to him I have also discussed with him verbally and pointed out to accept your suggestion of ]*s..500/- per annum for the 9 Red Oxide Concession in Abu Musa and the usual royalty of 'Rs.2/- per ton after the extraction of 1000 tons. The Shaikh's reply to me was that ?.s.500/- per 1000 tons appears to 'be Rs.0-8-0 per ton which is very small. I told him that it would 'be 'better to accept this term as this amount would also 'be of some help to him for his expenses. If he does not agree to this who else would offer to purchase the '^ed Oxide from him. Tho is he and of what nationality. The Shaikh replied that no one had as yet offered to purchase the ^.ed Oxide from him and he promised to discuss this matter with his 'brothers, Shaikhs I'uhammad and Itajid and then send me a m reply. On the 19th September 1928 a letter was received by me from the Shaikh which I am forv/arding in original for your information. I understand that the Shaikh would not agree to Rs.500/- but he would agree to ?vs «1000 per annum and decision rests with you. vl Letter No-437, dated 12th Rabi I, 1347 (28-8-28) from the Residency Igent, Shargah, to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, Chief of Shargah.K.C- I am direoted 'by tlie T Ton*l3l6 th6 Political in the Persian Gulf to inform you tliat T'essrs Striok &amp; ^o have now replied that they are unahle to accept the renev/al of the concession of A'bu Kusa ^ed Oxide according to the ■ terms already intimated in your letter because * ley consider that there is no demand for it so tiat t ie^ ma^y take more interest and offer more for it.

Their Letter under reference v/hich is in reply to ours of 2nd June appears to indicate that they are now unwilling to renew their contract at any price. On the other hand the Sheikh of Shragah seeias Confident of securing another and 'better market for \ his oxide - prohahly Persian or ante-British - and indeed afcks for permission to do so in case .. im ji i ■ - i:r3 ^ 'T 7 ' his reduced terms prove, as they have since done, to 'be unacceptable to ^trick &amp; Ooy.
