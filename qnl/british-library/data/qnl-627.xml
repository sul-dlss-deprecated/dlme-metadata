There are two enclosures to Kemball's letter:1. Letter no.339 of 1853 (folios 384-87) from Kemball to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, dated 7 November 1853. Kemball writes to Robinson to report on intelligence he has received from the British Agent at Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh] about the importation of thirty slaves into Bandar-e Charak and forty slaves into Kelat. Kemball requests the Robinson arrange for the removal of these slaves to the British depot at Bassidore. Included as part of Kemball's letter is a translation of the intelligence report from the British Agent at Bandar-e Lengeh (Mulla Ahmed), dated 16 October 1853, which contains information about the thirty slaves imported into Bandar-e Charak, as well as information about a woman abducted into slavery from Socotra [Suqutr√°]. The translated extract of a second report from Mulla Ahmed, dated 27 October 1853, is also included with Kemball's letter. This report concerns the forty slaves landed at Kelat from Zanzibar.2. Letter no.340 of 1853 (folios 388-89) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 7 November 1853, which concerns arrangements for the transfer of the emancipated slaves at Bandar-e Charak and Kelat to the Presidency at Bombay, by whatever means is most practical and cost-efficient.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x000066#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
