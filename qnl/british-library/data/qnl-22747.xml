D. 0. .N Q. 4 9 6.-£. 1935. vy. KKCEiVED ^ *&lt; %o © i OV VS JULY 1931 .-/* The Kesidency, Bushire, the 15th July 1932. 1 j&gt;^ H Will you please refer to your letter .No.C/119 of the 10th July 1932 forv/arding a draft of a proposed Extradition Treaty between the Bahrain Cfovernment and the 'dovernnent of Hej az-Uej d. -v . ^ /O / 1 have been through this and should like your comments on the following points. I note that in Article 3 you have inserted that the surrender of escaped slaves shall net be permissible. This does not appear in the ’Iraq-.Nejd treaty, and, as you know, the question of slaves is rather a live issue and rather a delicate matter at present in the Hejaz. It seems to me that what will probably happen is this; a slave will run away from Hasa, the Nejd people will accuse him of theft and will not say that he is a slave, and the man when brought before the Bahrain Courts will plead that he is an escaped slave. What do you propose to do about it ? Further he may not be a slave at all, but may merely be a servant who has run off with some of his master’s goods, but if he claims to be a slave it will give him a loop-hole to avoid extradition, and I think may involve the Bahrain Government in possibly acrimonious discussions with Nejd. Is it worth while inserting these extra words ? How, as regards the last portion of Article 4. I agree that demands for extradition should go through the Political Agent, and what we actually want in practice, if we are to get a rapid and simple procedure is for Bin Jiluwi to send his demand through you, and you to send your -demand to Bin Jiluwi. The regular legal procedure presumably would Ca^t. C. G. Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.- 2 - 2i- &amp; would be for the Hejaz-Hejd Grovernment to submit their demand to Minister, Jedda, who would forward it to you, and similarly for the Bahrain Government to submit their demand to you for transmission to Minister,Jedda. I am disposed to think there fore that this is the procedure that should be laid down in the treaty; but that notes should be attached to the treaty in which the two parties should agree that with a view to expediting the arrest of an absconder, the Governor of Hasa in the case of flejdis ( as opposed to Hejazis) in addition to addressing his own Government at Mecca, should be entitled, simultaneously to send you direct the requisite documentary evidence with a request for the detention of the individual concerned and an intimation that a formal application will in due course be received via Jedda, and similarly you should be entitled, in addition to addressing Minis ter,Jedda, to send the Governor of Hasa direct a copy of the evidence, etc*, with a request that he will detain the individual concerned pending receipt of a formal application for extradition, through Minister,Jedda. I have drafted a revised version of this portion of the Article and attach it herewith. As you will see it prescribes the orthodox procedure which, if my suggestion is accepted, would be supplemented by the exchange of notes authorising direct* communication between the Political Agent and the Governor of Hasa in the case of Hejdis escaping to Bahrain or Bahrainis escaping to Hejd. The orthodox procedure described in the treaty would be followed in the case of a Hejazi escaping from Jedda and making his way to Bahrain and vice versa: such cases would be few. The procedure in the notes would be followed in the case of Hejdis escaping to Bahrain and vice versa. I may mention that it is not correct to speak of a rolitical .'igent as H.B.M.’s political Agent, since this term isis for officials such, as consular and diplomatic officers who held commissions. I should be grateful if you could let me have a reply before the 4th August, when I hope to proceed on leaven® Revised versior of the last portion of Article 4 of the proposed Extradition Treaty between the Eahrai n Government and the Government of Hejaz and liejd. A demand for extradition made by the Government of Hejaz, Nejd,and dependencies to the Government of Bahrain shall be addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, who will transmit it to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for communication to the Government of Bahrain, And a demand for extradition made by the Government of Bahrain to the Government of Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies shall be addressed to the Political Agent, Bahrain, who will transmit it to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, for communication to the Government of Hejaz*Uejd and Dependencies,D.O.Kos; lll/ k Political Xt^Bazy, Bahrain,the 3rd August 1932. v&lt;&gt; / ’ receivod a letter from the late Sir Hugh Biscoe regarding the proposed extradition treaty between Bahrain and the Redjaa-Nejd Gcvemnaat and there are tTfo points on '.diioh he would like the views of the Bahrain Govorment. 2. The first one is the proviso in Article 3 that the surrender of escaped slaves will not be allowed. This,he says,does not appear in the 'Iraq-IIejd treaty and he considers it possible that slavos night run away from Easa Courts in Bahrain,he would pload that he was an escaped ' slave and so create difficulties. Also,he considers that the man might not be a slave at all but might be on absconding orininel claiming to be m. escaped slave,end he thinks this section might involve the Bahiain Govommoxt in some possibly acrimonious discussion with ;'ejd. lie seems to ho of the opinion that these words are not v/orth the trouble their insertion any produce. 3. Then lie refers to the last jj or Lion of paragraph 4 and he sends a suggested revised version altering the procedure. He thinks,however,that notes should be attached to the treaty in which the two parties should agree with a view to expediting matters that the Governor of liasu in the case of lejd should address the Political «gent simultaneously with his ova C'overnment,and the Political . ;ent while addressing the E'inister at Jedda should simultaneously address the Governor of Easa so that a person may be detained pending receipt of a fcrtnal application for extradition through the usual channels. Ofcourse in the rare case of allowing the extradition of an Iledjazi through Jedda the orthodoxl *“ ' ■ procedure would be adopted. 4. ... k.Tj always been opposed to this treaty,which is only going to cause us trouble and possibly increase Nejdi influence in Bahrain by enabling them to keep a tighter hold over their subjects here. As you know wo get many slaves from Hasa, certainly 10 a year,and if we are obliged to return any**of them on a trumped up oharge of a theft committed there,he would be subjected to appalling brutalities on his return end other slaves would be discouraged from attempting to obtain their freedom. I would be glad if you oould let me know the views of .\ the Bahrein Government on those points before you leave for ■'.nylon d. lours incerely, CeL.Belgrave iscuiro Adviser to the Baiirain Ciovernnient Ba.hr ain.T C/7f • The Secretariat, Bahrain, august 7th, 1932. 2 L f&gt;) I have again discussed the matter with Shaikh Ramad. Re sees no reason for altering the slave clause. I think myself that whether it is inserted or not, there will be^inevitably^attempts on the other party f s side to recover escaned slaves so I do not think the inser tion of the clause is likely in itself to provoke the question. Shaikh Hamad says that in a such a case the question of whether a fugitive was or was not a slave would be decided by the I.^ T s Court where he would be certain of obtaining justice. I think the treaty will certainly lead to ’’acrimonious discussion’’ but we cannot refuse to enter it on those grounds. ™ith reference to your para 3, Shaikh Hamad agrees to this suggestion. Shaikh Hamad himself appreciates the fact that the slave question is likely to crop up but because, as he says, it would be dealt with by the Agency, he is not troubled at the prospect. I think myself that in these days when the question of slavery is such a world wide one that out attempt to prevent surrender of slaves by a section in this proposed treaty is entirely laudable and justified. Shaikh Hamad himself is only very mildly interested i the treaty and only agrees to it because he is invited to do so and because he thinks it will be pleasing to E. M.

The moving factor behind the treaty is the 'Effendi-itnT of Bin 3aud T s Syrian advisers, not ably Yusif Yasin.and I have always thought that it v#ould be an unmixed nuisance and vdll certainly tighten hejd control over tljoir subjects here. 5.

The Residency, Bushire, 26th September 1932* k* Please refer to Sir Hugh Biscoe’s D*O.No,426-S of '27th June on the subject cf an extradition treaty between Bahrain and Nejd. 2. A reply was received from Prior - Political Agent, Bahrain - enclosing a draft of a treaty on the lines of the Hejaz-Iran Agreement, There ensued some correspondence between Sir Hugh and Prior on the point of the insertion, or omission, of a clause stating that escaped slaves should not be surrendered. Prior was for the insertion of such a clause, and Sir Hugh for its omission. There would seem to be argu ments for both points of views. 3. What I can make up n$ r mind on is the undesirability of hnving such a treaty at all I On general principles the fewer agreements we have with the seni-civi1ised potentates and Shaikhs of Arabia the better. When a treaty is made His Majesty’s Government abide by the letter and the spirit, or see to it that their proteges - if it is the latter who have made the agreement- do so. The Arabian potentate genera lly abides by neither the spirit nor the letter. With regard to the proposed treaty in particular, Prior writes! M The moving factor behind the treaty is the M Effendi-ism” of Bin Baud’s Syrian advisers, notably Yusif Yasin, and I have always thought that it would be an unmixed nuisance and will certainly tighten Nejdi control over their subjects here.” With regard to the slave question he says; “However, since the A.C .C .Park ins on ,Esq. ,C .M.G. ,O.B.E., Colonial Office, London.© 'the onus of any unpleasantness that may ensue will fall on the Agency, Shaikh Hamad views it with equanimity. Actually Shaikh Hamad is very mildly interested in the treaty and only embarked on it because we invited him to consider it and because, he thinks, it will please Bin S&amp;ud.' 4. Generally speaking I agree with Prior. Instead of the treaty leading to more amicable relations between Bahrain and Nejd I am afraid that it will have the opposite effect of raising unpleasant questions between the two parties, into which we shall of course be dragged. Nor does there seem to be any crying need to alter the present position Even when no extradition treaty exists a State f at its own discretion, can always surrender a fugitive from another country. In fact its powers are, in a sense, wider than under a treaty where the offences for which an offender can be extradited, and the procedure to be followed, are meticulously laid down. Thus in any particular case, Bahrain could always give up a man 'wanted' by Nejd, and vice versa . 5. The suggestion for the treaty has come from Ibn Baud, or rather - as Prior suggests - from his 'Effendi' Syrian Adviser: Yusif Yasin. There is no reason at present why we should go out of our way to please Ibn Saud - rather the contrary. If Ibn Saud really wants the treaty he will doubtless put up the matter again through Sir Andrew Ryan; and if he is lukewarm about it, he won’t. If Ibn Baud does pursue the matter I have got the Bahrain draft here ready, and can give my views. In the meantime I suggest we do nothing• Yours sincerely, sd/- T.C.Powle.C onfidential Downing Street 98148/32 29th October 1932 Dear Fowle, J Many thanks for your demi-official letter 708-S of the 26th September about an extradition treaty between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, I have sent copies to the Foreign Office and India Office w for consideration” and I hope to let you have a reply before very long.

Article 3. 1. The Government of Saudi Arabia and the Government of Koweit shall appoint frontier officers in the zones adjacent to the frontiers for the organisation of co-operation and for carrying out the measures necessary to ensure the application of the provisions of this Agreement in everything relating to peace and tranquillity in the territory of the other party and in whatever is necessary to ensure commercial co-operation between the two countries and to facilitate good relations between them; and the two Govern- this purpose ^ ^ 0t ' ° f ^ name8 ° f the - P ersons appointed for‘2. These frontier officers, or any persons acting on their behalf, shall have the right to communicate with each other for the purpose of frontier co-operation as provided in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement and the schedule annexed thereto, and with a view to the settlement of questions arising from time to time on the frontier or between the tribes. Article 4. The frontier officers specified in Article 3 shall exchange information immediately regarding any incident occurring on either side of the frontier which may affect the maintenance of security cn the other side. Article 5. 1. Whenever one of the frontier officers specified in Article 3 learns of preparations being made in his territory by an armed person or by armed persons with the object of committing acts of robbery or plunder or raiding or any other unlawful act of such nature as to disturb the peace of the frontier between the two countries, he shall inform the other thereof.' 2. If it should appear that this information will not arrive in time to admit of warning being given to those liable to be injured by the aggression, the information must be given in addition to the nearest official and, in case of its being impossible to reach him, to the persons or tribes threatened. Article 6. 1. If one of the frontier officers should learn of the commission in his territory of any act of robbery or plunder or smuggling or raiding or any other unlawful act of such a nature as to disturb the peace of the frontier between the two countries, he may notify the other thereof, and in circum stances of urgent necessity he shall inform the nearest official of the other Government.

If the offenders are nationals of the country which they have entered, the necessary measures shall be taken to put them on trial in their own country.

The frontier officer of the Government which considers it to be iu^ its interest to impose such a restriction shall inform the frontier officer o. ' the other Government of that decision before it is put into effect, in order that the latter may have an opportunity to adopt means to overcome any difficulties which may result from the execution of the decision, on the understanding that it is incumbent upon the frontier officers, in such cases, that both should use their best endeavours to remove any difficulty which may be pointed out by either of them as likely to result from the application of this prohibition, if it can be removed; and if it cannot, then the prohibi tion shall come into force.
