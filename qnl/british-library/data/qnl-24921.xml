' &lt; ^ notable and happy event occurred this week in tb^ '• relations of Kuwait with its great neighbour Saudi-Arabia. Some 20 years ago, certain difficulties caused the cessation of the trade that used to' flow freely from Kuwait into the interior of Arabia. Prolonged efforts to solve these difficulties have at last, through the v/isdom of His Majesty King ABDUL AZIZ AL SaOUD, King of Saudi Arabia and His Highness Sheikh Sir AHMED IBN JaBIR AL SUBAH, Sheikh of ( Kuwait, been crowned with success. Agreements dealing with trade, friendship and neighbourly relations, and extradition between the two states, were initialled last Tuesday, and will come into force before the end of the present month. The successful outcome of the find! stage of the negotiations, which took place at Kuwait, was due in considerable measure -go the helpful attitude of His Excellency Sheikh HaFIZ 7AHBA, the Minister for Saudi-Arabia in London, and representative of that OOlmt.-p-V i n +y-|P&gt;oo -rw^rrr&gt;+ -i Q 4 - British Government and the Government of the Yemen, which we announced in our broadcast of the 23rd February, that negotiations shall now begin for the settlement of the southern frontier of the, Yemen, it is learnt that Mr. R.S.

This force, he states, is ready for an instant call to -arms. Reservists have already bee'n called up and the 'closest 'cooperation is being maintained with the French in Syria. In the event of war the force would probably have the position of advance guard of the British forces encamped in the Near East, and its motto is 'First into action and last out'. It is an Imperial unit under British officers. About half of them are Moslem Arabs, and more than a quarter Christian Arabs. Gf the remainder, most of them are Circassians, but there are also Egyptians, Sudanese, Druses and Jews, v/ith a small number of Europeans. It is an ideal reconnaissance unit. 4 5. ‘ In connection with the arrangements between the. 6. The trial of the persons accused of the murder.of \ 7 .

They might have. had to wait a very long time,- if they had taken no action before the League came to a decision on the matter. Turning to the appeals which had been made to alleviate the cruel position of the Jews in Central Europe, Mr. Macdonald declared that Palestine was making its contribution to .that problem. In the current 12 months, they were making.provision for an entry into Palestine of irfbre than 20,.000 Jews. Most of these have already arrived. At: '' i ,••• g; ./: , 0 \ In.conclusion, Mr. Macdonald said: ”We recognise fully the rights oj^ the Jews in Palestine, but there are other people in Palestine. There are the Arabs who have rights equal to the rights of the Jews. We are going to : protect those rights as well as we protect the- rights of the-Jews., .'There can qnly be peace., and progress in Palestine on the basis of mutual, recognition of -bhe rights of the two communities.” *'G ‘ ' A , • .V His Highness.the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan yesterday, honoured Reuter’s special correspondent with an interview, y/hich took place in the Amir’s palace overlooking Amman. ’’The Arabs,,’’ said His Highness, ”are- eager to fight for the Allies in the present struggle with the same objects as those for which they fought ins the last war - namely, liberty and justice. But we are keenly disappointed that we have no army. We are witnessing a 'large Imperial army gathering in the Near past in order to defend our countries, and we are unhappy to feel that we must rely solely on others ,to defend us. We Arabs desire not only to support the Allies, if blood must be shed in defence of our principles and our country, we demand that Arab blood shall be mingled with that of our friends the British.” The Amir stated that he regarded the new regulations about the transfer of land in Palestine as a ”slap in the face for Hitler”, and an answer to Nazi propaganda which5W i&amp;' FILE- 20) I }) O ^ T1 ] ^ (l i 5 /i_i£±o_J Allotted to Political Department. 54 groups,.

Koweit soon (? after) war broke out imposed regulation that all Bedouins must obtain clearance papers from local authorities for exports, so only new departure for Koweit will be to inform Saudi agent as regards Saudis* Hafiz could not agree to total exclusion of Article, (b) and (d), no remarks. (e), question of Joint Commission is of course new, but Hafiz did not seem to think that Commission would materialize early. In any case, Koweit seems to have nothing to lose by a settlement.

It seems almost impossible to reach any agreement over musabala, and it occurs to us that a solution might be to remove all mention of musabala from the Agreements. Article 9 of the Trade Agreement is not very satisfactory from the legal point of view since it confers no powers or rights on either sice which they d not possess in any case. If the Sheikh of Kov/eit is willing to let tribesmen from Saudi territory enter Koweit territory for musabala or for any other purpose without getting his permission beforehand, he can let them do so without a written agreement to this effect between himself and Ibn Saud. Similarly, if Ibn 3aud wishes to say that his tribesmen must not leave Saudi territory without a document issued by the Saudi authorities,/ J.P. Gibson, Esq-with the Sheikh. In practice, no doubt, Ibn Saud finds great difficulty in controlling Bedouin on the desert frontier and he wishes the Sheikh to do it for him. At any rate it seems that our best course now would be to try to get both sides to agree to the omission of Article 9 of the Trade Agreement and the words 'or musabala ' in Article 9 of the Bon Voisinage Agreement and the whole of Article 11 (5) of that Agreement. 3 . As regards the enlistment of the nationals of one government in the armed forces of the other, there seems no difficulty about this and we suggest it would be best to omit Article 10 of the Bon Voisinage Agreement altogether. 4. As regards the list of tribes in Article 7 of the Schedule to the Bon Voisinage Agreement, we think that it would be best for the Sheikh to make a list of the tribes whom he claims as his subjects, as suggested in paragraph 6 of Troths telegram. 5. We also agree with Trott that the insertion of the words 'third Arab State' in Articles 1 and 2 of the Extradition/_ Extradition Agreement should he a satisfactory solution. 6 . If you agree with our suggestions on these points perhaps you would consider sending a telegram on these lines to Koweit and repeating it to Jedda.Decypher. AMENDED Cl eiG C 0 9 JTED DISTRIBUTION.

About enlistment, King had no objection to the Sheikh* desire that both Governments could * employ* nationals of ¥ the^ other in their armed forces. 4. About list of tribes, King suggested that Bedouin living in Koweit who wish to remain Koweitis should be listed by a joint Commission. 5. About Sheikh's lack of jurisdiction over Nationals of* third States, King asked whether there would be an agreement with His Majesty’s Government to cover such cases. 6. Concerning *Musabala* and enlistment, I suggest drafts on above-mentioned lines might be prepared in Koweit and telegraphed here for submission to the King when he visits the’fiejaz* about the middle of January.

Sheikh expects to return after about 8 or 10 days. Ends .Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 158 of the 1st November, regarding the proposed Saudi-Koweit Agreements respecting Trade, Friendly Relations and Bon Voisinage, and Extradition, I transmit to you herewith a copy of an express letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. C/294 of the 3rd August, together with its enclosures, and also re—drafts of the three Agreements,. Marginal comments have 'been added to explain the chief points still in dispute 'between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Saudi Arabian Government. Notes are also enclosed on various other amendments which have been Made. 2 . I see no objection to the omission of the v/ords 'in their own name' from the preambles to the Agreements 0 I cannot, however, accept the Saudi Arabian proposal that the Agreements should be drawn up in Arabic only. It is essential that there should be an English text of any agreement which is signed on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and which will subsequently be published as a White Paper. There is no analogy between these agreements and the Bon Vois i nage Agreement of 1933 with Transjordan, to which His Majesty’s Government were not a party. Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., G.I.E., etc., etc., etc., /3o Jedda.—i * 3. Many drafting amendments have been made to which there is no reference in the notes 0 For example, the words ’’between the respective territories' have been omitted from the preamble to the Agreement for Friendship and Neighbourly Relations, since it seems sufficient to say that good relations exist between the rulers and their families. I do not, however, wish to cause difficulties over questions of phraseology and you may at your discretion adopt in such matters any form of words which you consider necessary to meet the Saudi Arabian point cf view. 4. It appears that the most serious point still outstanding is the question of 'Musabala'. The Sheikh’s objection that it is impossible for Bedouin to obtain documents from the Saudi Arabian authorities every time they v/ish to cross the frontier into Koweit territory seems reasonable, - it must at any rate be difficult for them to do so; and I trust that you will be able to induce the Saudi Arabian Government to abandon their insistence on this provision. 5. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Koweit. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.j lacy baggallayTRADE AGREMtiNT . [British copy: in the Saudi Arabian G °Py&gt; Saudi Arabia would be mentioned first throughout]. The Government of the United Kingdom of u-reat Britain and Northern Ireland (herein- after called the Government of the United Kingdom), acting on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit, of the one part, and the Government of Saudi Arabia, of the other part, being desirous of concluding an Agreement to regulate trade between Koweit and Saudi Arabia, have appointed as their Representatives for this purpose: who, having examined their credentials and found them to be in good and due form, have agreed as follows: Article 1 . (1) All goods which leave Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia by land or sea must be accompanied by a person carrying a manifestmanifest.

The provisions about smuggling contained in the present regulations shall be applicable to goods transported by sea and to the persons transporting them. (4) A caravan shall consist of not less than one motor vehicle or three animals. A rticle 2, The person responsible for a caravan or party such as is mentioned in Article 1 shall, before his departure with the caravan (or party) and with the goods from Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia, obtain a manifest from the Koweit Customs Department (Manifest Office) for all the goods destined for Saudi Arabia. This manifest must accompany the goods, and a copy of it shall be given to the Saudi Arabian Trade Agent in Koweit by theKoweit Customs Office before the caravan (or party) leaves Koweit territory, and a third copy of the manifest shall be kept in the Manifest Office. It is forbidden to take a quantity greater or less than that shown in the manifest or to go to any destination other than that mentioned in the manifest or by any route other than the ordinary one. Article 5 . Should the merchant or owner of the goods choose to send part of the goods by motor car and part by camel, or by two caravans, or part by sea and part by land, a separate manifest must accompany each part. Article 4 .

In both cases he shall be liable to a fine.

Otherwise they themselves shall be held re sponsible if the evasionreomes to light. Article 6 . The Customs officials of Koweit and of Saudi Arabia at the specified posts may communicate with one another in order to ensure mutual understanding and the common good as regards the application of the provisions of this Agreement.

If any goods destined for Saudi Arabia are found to have left Koweit territory, whether by land or sea, without the foregoing provisions having been complied with, such goods shall be considered contraband and, together with the means of transport, shall be liable to confiscation; moreover, any person whatsoever who infringes or who attempts to evade or circumvent these provisions shall be liable to punishment by imprisonment, or fine, or both. Article 9 . Any national of either of the two Governments*rThe Saudis who desire to retain these words consider that to allow persons on the Saudi side of the frontier 'to enter Koweit without obtaining permits from the Saudi authorities, would encourage smuggling and nullify the agreement (c.f. Art 11.(5) of the Bon Voisinage Agreement). The Sheikh of Koweit who desires to omit them insists on unrestricted entry for purposes of 'musabala” and has offered to place a personal check on all purchases in Koweit by Bedouins from Saudi Arabia] Governments may enter the territory of the other for ’’musabala' wihltput obtaining permission from the other beforehand, provided that he travels by one of the prescribed routes [ &gt;!c and carries a document issued by the competent authorities in his own country establishing his identity and authorising him to make the proposed journey].

(2) If it should appear that this information will not arrive in time to admit of warning being given to those liable to be injured by the aggression, the information must be given in addition to the nearest official and, in case of it$ being impossible to reach him, to the persons or tribes threatened.

But these and similar changes of form in our own phraseology need not necessarily entail any corresponding change in the Arabic texts. Article l(2) . The wording has been amended to make the meaning clearer in English. This also need not affect the Arabic text. Article l(4) . Definition of 'caravan' has been added. Article 6 . Since the Trade Agreement has now been put in the same form as the other two agreements, it is preferable to refer in this and other articles to 'the provisions of this 'Agreement' rather than to 'the rules of this0) ’•neighbourly relations’' instead of ' bon H voisinage” in the English text; there is no need to insist on this amendment if the Saudis object to it. Article 2 . The use of the term ’’the two contracting ’•parties” in this and other articles will not do, since it is the Government of Koweit, and not His Majesty’s Government, which are required to preserve good relations, etc. It is « ft &lt; • • » E therefore essential to return to the original wording in these articles, i. e. ’’the ’’Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Koweit”. The mention of the ’’Government of Koweit” also makes it necessary to substitute the word « • « V ’’shall” for the words ’’undertake to”, since the Government of Koweit are not actually a party to the Agreement. Article 5 ./Article 3 . The words 'frontier officers' have 'been used throughout for the varying terms hy which these officials are designated in the Saudi drafts. Article 6 . Presumably the surrender of nationals of one of the States to that State hy the other State is to take place in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Agreement. It is therefore desirable to insert the words 'subject to the provisions of the Extradition 'Agreement signed on 1939' before the words 'be surrendered'. An alternative course r r would be to say 'without prejudice to the 'provisions' or - though this would be less desirable - 'notv/ithstanding anything to the 'contrary contained in.

It might make it easier for the Saudis if the art icle read 'seal o r sta mp' (rubber) of the compefent authorities.

Dear Gibson, Would you please refer to your official letter P.Z* 4984/39 of the 18th August, in which was enclosed a copy of an express letter from Fowle on the subject of the Saudi-Koweit agreements? 2* It seems that it will be very difficult to get any agreement over the question of 'Musabala,' though it is possible that, as Fowle suggests, the Saudi Arabian Government may prove more accommodating in present circumstances. 3* If you have no further observations to make, we propose to instruct Bullard to put forward the Sheikas objections to the Saudi drafts and also the various points mentioned in Baggallay^ letter to you of ther Minute Paper. cf. p.z. 4984/39- Department. Mr. Gibson, Herewith the Saudi-Koweit Bon Voisinage Agreement The two main difficulties continue to he (i) MusahaJLa. (ii) Enumeration of tribes over which Ihn Saud and Sheikh of Koweit claim sovereignty. Powle suggests that control of (i) might he left to the personal check of the Sheikh and his officials^ as proposed hy him (vide P.Z.9219/36 file attached). As to (ii) Powle suggests omission of all reference to tribes and tribal sovereignty. The Foreign Office have had copies of Powle ! s Express Letter and enclosures (P.Z.4984/39) which they will doubtless consider in the light of their letter of 4th May (P.Z.2824/39).

These two places, in the Shaikh’s opinion, are the only places practicable because of the lack of sweet water elsewhere. Paragraph 5 (viii) of the Shaikh’s reply: The Shaikh’s point is that if the traders import sufficient goods there will be no incentive for the Bedouin to smuggle, and therefore no need to restrict their movements. The Shaikh is adamant that no restrictions should be placed on the Bedouin, whereas the Saudis will apparently insist (vide para graph 4 of enclosure 1 to Jedia despatch No. 51 of the 19th {Signature) March/ S. 44.

In coiapany with O-alloway I have had various conversations with the Shaikh, who raises the following objections. (a) Extradition Agreement Article 1. 'Third State', and other references where the same point arises i.e. letter annexed to Extradition Agreement to define smuggling offences 'if he is not a Kuwait national', Bon Voisinage Agreement Article 6 last.paragraph 'if they are not nationals of the country which they have entered', Article 12 of the same treaty 'shall prevent foreigners etc.,'.

(b) Prjfflfl facie the Saudi Government are certainly in correct in claiming, as they appear to do, all the sections of all the tribes enumerated as being subject to them. Some of the tribes and their habit a Is are mentioned in Lorimer's Gazetteer Volume II. This question of suzerainty over tribes is a important one and if the Shaikh were to give up officially and publicly in a treaty his suzerainty over sections of tribes which have always been recognised as being under Kuwait, his prestige would certainly suffer. I do not think that he will give in on this point. There would seem to be only two solutions, either for the Saudi Govern ment to drop this clause or for the two parties to come to an agreement over the sections of the (c) The present situation, which has lasted about six 'is, months,/according to information given me by the Shaikh, that Ibn Saud, without any public announce ment to that effect on the subject, has relaxed and therefore this would prevent musabala of this kind My comments are as follows.I I | 3. his blockade somewhat by allowing his tribesmen , to go to Kuwait and other neighbouring States for musabala. This Ibn Saud has done not with any idea of helping Kuwait but under pressure from his tribes. The Shaikh naturally wants this situation to continue. 4. The Shaikh told me that iC was not Tbn Saud himself who made difficulties but some of his e ntourage such as Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Hamza, and that if he - the Shaikh - could have a personal interview with Ibn Saud, he could probably settle matters with him. I think there is a good deal in this. The Shaikh is visiting Ibn Saud shortly vide my telegram No. T/97 of 22nd May 1939 and I am of the opinion that the Shaikh should be informed that there is no objection to his having a private and informal conversation with Ibn Saud on subjects (b) and (c) above, (a) being reserved for consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (The subject of the Agreements will, I imagine, in any case come up in the course of conversations between the two Hulers). I would be grateful for a telegram as soon as possible authorising this communication. I suggest that Ibn Saud be not informed of this as any commun ication to tnis effect would have to go through either Yusuf Yasin or Fuad Hamza who, I am afraid, would then do their best to prevent any concessions by Ibn Saud.tl In any further communication on this sul)ject, please quote No }o/3Jk/ 2 and addins —not to any person byjicfne, Imt^o— “ Th^^^j^er-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, Lond^w^jJ XJ* 3o V 3089 iS:\9 THE Under-Set^^jr^f State for resents his compliments to 'Usv^yliLsr- cr/- y /w y - - ■ transmi and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop*«^j of the under-mentioned paper.

Addressed to Gedda No 0 8S, repeated to Koweit.*OPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of incite. .ft'A.i&amp;i r 6 +&gt;A&lt;dr My dear Gibson, You will have received officially a copy of Jedda despatch No. 51 of the 19th March in which were enclosed the drafts of the three Saudi-Koweit agreements as revised by the Saudi Arabian Government. 2. There are many points in these revised drafts which are not satisfactory, but we feel that there is no object in commenting on them in detail until we know how far the Saudi amendments are acceptable to the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf and to the Sheikh of Koweit. When the substance of the agreements is more or less decided, we can consider questions of form and polish. 3. There are, however, certain observations which we would like to make straight away: (a) The proposed change in the English text of Article 1(2) of the Trade Agreement (i.e. so as to make it/ J.P. Gibson, Esq.it read 'Persons entering Kowreit territory from Saudi Arabia and leaving again v/ith goods bought may as well be embodied the next time the text is copied out, either here or in the Gulf. (b) Similarly, the preamble and termination clauses of the Trade Agreement may as well be added next time the text is copied. But these clause^ as enclosed in my letter E 607/34/25 of February 14th to Peel, will need to be amended so as to correspond with whatever is decided upon for the corresponding clauses of the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements. In addition'five years' has to be changed to three years' (I am not sure whether you want this change for the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements as well). (c) We have no insuperable objection to omitting 'in their own name' from the preambles to any of the Agreements, although the words seem to emphasise precisely what the Saudi Arabian Government want, namely that His Majesty’s Government by contracting in their own name bind themselves to see that the agreement is carried out on the KoweitIn other respects the prearables, as 24i Koweit side. In other respects the preambles, as re-drafted, will want tidying up a bit, (d) The use of the term 'two contracting parties' in Articles 2, 3 etc. of the Bon Voisinage Agreement v/ill not do, because the contracting parties are His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government while the parties which are to preserve good relations, appoint officials, etc, are the Saudi-Arabian Government and the Koweit Government. In view, particularly, of the proposed omission of 'in their own name' from the preamble, it seems essential to return to the original v/ording of these articles i.e. 'the Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Koweit'. (e) Our original draft of the Bon Voisinage Agreement spoke of 'frontier officials' throughout. The Saudi re-draft speaks indiscriminately of 'officials', 'frontier M officials', 'special officials' and competent authority'. It is desirable to use one phrase for one thing throughout. (f) We are not sure what significance to attach to the proposed omission from Article 3 etc. of the words 'through the British Legation at Jedda'. These wordsare not essential, since, whether they are in or out, the Saudi Arabian Government must only communicate with the Sheikh through His Majesty*s Government. At the same time they cross a ’*t', so to speak, without emphasising /t. » .1 . ' ^ unduly what ought to be obvious, a process which often merely makes the obvious less obvious than before. Perhaps the Saudis wish to leave the way open to use the Saudi Legation in London, v/hich they are quite entitled to do. (g) With regard to (4) of the notes on the Trade Lf Agreement, I am not clear what exactly it is that the Saudis want included in this Agreement. If you think it desirable, we could ask the Legation by telegram to suggest a draft article which they think would meet the Saudi point. (h) We shall have to insist on English and Arabic as the languages of the Agreements. (i) In the extradition agreement, Koweit cannot undertake to surrender nationals of third States. The Government of Koweit has not got jurisdiction over the nationals of all third States, but only over the nationalsof other Arab States on the Persian Gulf. His Majesty f s Government are, it is true, the party to the agreement and they have the jurisdiction which the Sheikh of Koweit lacks; hut His Majesty’s Government could never agree that persons over whom they had jurisdiction should he extradited to Saudi Arabia under an agreement of this character. Therefore Article 1 must either omit the words 'of a third State' or substitute for them 'of a third Arab State'. (j) We do not much like the idea of dropping the requirement that documents in extradition cases shall be sealed. The possibilities of the misuse of extradition proceedings are numerous, and we should not have thought that this meagre safeguard would have seriously inconvenienced the Saudi administration. If the requirement about seals has to be dropped we should at least like to substitute something corresponding to our authentication of signatures.No. 51 •'*' 5 j British Legation, (615/1172/18) Jedda. March 19th., 1939. y~ tn* My Lord, In accordance with the instructions v/hich I had the honour to receive from you in your telegram No. 29 dated March 1st,, I have discussed with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, who was appointed by Ibn Saud for the purpose, the drafts of the proposed Bon Voisinage and Extradition agreements bet ween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Copies of the Arabic text which the Saudi Government would like to see accepted, together with a translation in English, and notes on the above-mentioned agreements and on the Trade Agreement, arc being sent to Bushire and Kuv/ait for detailed con sideration. Herewith I transmit copies of the English translation and of the notes. s * During the discussions with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin two or three questions of form were raised on which I should be glad to have your instructions. These questions are set forth in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 below. 3. It was stated in paragraph 4 of Foreign Office telegram ho. 22,—-dated February 5th. , that appropriate draft preamble and termination clauses would be sent, iliese clauses have not reached me, and I have therefore made use, in the discussions with Shaikh Yusuf, of the preambles to the Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements as drafted at Kuwait. / 4 The Fight Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G.,4. It will be remembered that the Saudi Government asked, when the negotiations began, that His Majesty’s Government should guarantee the execution of the Trade Agreement. It is now clear that they expected the pro cedure to be that followed in the case of the Bon Voisinage Agreement with Trans-Jordan, where His Majesty's Government did not sign tne Treaty, but letters v/ere annexed in which wjo r,3 dc clear that His Majesty's Government accepted opcn.abilitj, for the fulfilment of the provisions of the Treaty by the Amir of Trans-Jordan. On finding that the agreement: with Kuwait would be signed by His Majesty's Government, the Saudi Government suggested the deletion of the main portion of Article 1 (2) of the draft Bon Voisin age Agreement as superfluous. To this deletion there will. I suppose, be no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government or of His Highness the Shaikh, but there is a connected point on which I am doubtful. The Saudi Govern- ment suggest that in the phrase in the preambles 'acting in--their own name and on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait”, the words here underlined are superfluous as expressing a guarantee which they new consider implied by the fact that the agreements will be signed by a repres entative of His Majesty's Government; but I am not sure whether their assumption is correct, or whether the words are net essential in view of the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the foreign affairs of Kuwait. M. The Saudi Government propose that the agreements hall be. drawn up in Arabic only. They quote as precedents the .ion Voisinage agreements with Iraq and Trans-Jordan,and they have a strong preference for the use of Arabic alone; hut they will not make concession on this point a condition of signature. o. The two most difficult points proved to he the definition of political offences, and the question whether any categories of persons could he allowed to cross the 1 rentier without passes of some kind. Notes on these points will he found in the appropriate enclosures to this despatch. The movements of hunters, to which reference was made in your above-mentioned telegram, is to he covered, the Saudi Government suggest, by an oral 'Gentlemen’s Agreement'. *7. Copies of this despatch and of the enclosures are being sent to the Government of India (616/1172/18), the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (617/1172/18), and the Political Agent Kuwait (618/1172/16). To Bushire and Kuwait I am also sending, as stated above, the Arabic texts which have resulted from the discussions in Jedda.

(1) The wording as received from Kuwait in Arabic is as had already been agreed with the Saudi Government. (2) The list of frontier posts on the Saudi side is as follows: By land: (a) Al Qarya (b) Hafr. By &amp;ea: (a) Tas Tanura (b) Jubail (c) Qatif (d) ’Ujair. The list of Kuwait posts is av/aited. The Saudi Government would be prepared to increase by mutual agreement the num- [U,^ ber of posts on their side if those now proposed proved to be insufficient. (3) f 1 he Saudi Government propose as definition of a ’’caravan”: one motor-vehicle or three animals. They con- tLcA~ tend^no hardship would be caused with the minimum so low, for no individual would have to wait long for a ’’caravan” to assemble. ^4) The Saudi Government cling tenaciously to their asser tion that to allow persons from the Saudi side of the frontier to enter Kuwait territory on the pretext of musabala (purchase of goods), without requiring them to have permits from the Saudi authorities, would encourage smuggling and nullify the safeguards proposed. The 4 , (JLl- fitfH relevant provision is embodied in Article iy, which covers all cases of crossing the frontier except that of the hunter, but perhaps it v/ould be well to repeat the provision in the Trade Agreement. His Majesty's Legation do not think it possible to get the agreement through without this provision.Enclosure No* 2 in Jedda despatch No. 51 dated March 19th. 1939. Notes on the draft Bon Voisinage Agreement (March 6th., * a», in i m n i.w 1939). (1/ In the preamble and in Article 1 there are references to relations of friendship and bon voisinage as existing between the twc countries from of old. In view of the long blockade this wording is not strictly accurate, but the grievances are not all on one side, and in any case it does not seem worth while objecting to such formulas. (n) In some passages v/here the Jedda draft of March 6th. differs i rom the Kuwait draft it will be found that either the sense and/or the Arabic wording follows the Trans-Jordan Bon Voisinage Agreement more closely than does the Kuwait draft. ^3) With the exception of two passages about preserving good relations and trying to settle any differences in a friendly spirit, the whole of Article 1 (2) of the Kuwait draft has been cut out by the Saudi Government as unnecessary because His Majesty’s Government are to sign the agreement on behalf of Kuwait. (4; In Article 5 a passage which does not appear in the Kuwait draft has been taken from the Trans-Jordan Bon Voisin age Agreement: 'Warning must be given in addition to the nearest official and, in case of its being impossible to roach him, to the persons or tribes threatened.' In Article 6 the Saudi Government have inserted the word smuggling', on the ground that the prevention of smuggling is the object of the purpose of the negotiations, or rather that smuggling is the cause of the difficulties which the / negotiationsnegotiations are intended to rerove. ' 6) In Article 7 the references to usage and custom in Article 7 (l) of the Kuwait draft have been cut out by the Saudi Government, who declare that in the relations between the two countries such matters have always been dealt with in accordance with the Sharia Law. ^7) The Saudi Government have proposed the omission of 7 (2) in the Kuwait draft - The y argue that the jnuA^. corresponding provision in the Trans-Jordan Agreement (Article 7) has been found unnecessary, and that it is superfluous in the present instance. I am inclined to agree with them in this. (6) The Saudi Government have added to Article 8 of the Kuwait draft a prevision that cases which the frontier officials cannot settle shall be referred to the two Con tacting Parties.. This provision, which implies reference tc His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda, is all that is left of Article 13, which the Saudi Government consider to be Wvft. = ur *ersome. i n principle these efforts to attain simplicity are to be encouraged. (9,) In Article 9 the words ”or musabal a” have been omitted, as tne Saudi Government consider that it would stultify the agreements if any person, was allowed to cross the frontier without permission by merely alleging that he was going to Md ^ vt purchases. The conditions governing the case of musabala is to be found in Article 11 (.5) of the Jedda draft. (10) The third paragraph of Article 9 in the Jedda draft is based. Shaikh Yusuf informs me, on discussions which have taken place with the Iraq. Government who, while unwilling to / allowjtam ^ i allov/ Saudi officials to enter their territory for such purpcsc, are prepared to eject any Saudi tribe into Saudi Arabia on receipt of a demand to that effect from the Saudi Government. Shaikh Yusuf alleges that the Shaikh of Kuwait by friendly arrangement with Ibn Saud, allowed Saudi tax- collectors to enter Kuwait territory last r year to collect zakat from the Saudi tribes. (ll; As amended by the Saudi Government, Article 10 allows one Government to employ nationals of the other in its armed forces provided the assent of the latter has been obtained. The Saudi Government say that this amendment is inserted in the interests of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose followers include a number of Saudi nationals. Tley declare that they themselves have nothing to gain by uho amendment, which so far as they are concerned can be struck out. (12) Article 11 of the Jedda draft is intended to cover all cases of crossing the frontier, except that of the hunter. Ibn Saud does not wish to state in writing that persons engaged in hunting may cross the frontier without permission, but he has sent word to me through Shaikh lusuf Yasin that this would be winked at under an oral 'Gentlemen’s Agreement”. (13) Article 11 (2) provides for the despatch of officials as messengers to Kuwait or Riyadh. Such persons are to be allowed to cross the frontier with permission from the other Government provided they are ’’authorised” by their own Government. The Saudi Government do not wish to define authorised” more exactly, because, they say, this paragraph / onlyonly records in writing a practice which is already working perfectly well, and I suggest that this accommodating spirit is to he welcomed. (1 4 ) Article 11 (5) requires the person who wishes to make purchases over the frontier to get a pass from his own side, this provision will he unwelcome to the Government of Kuwait, hut it is regarded as essential hy the Saudi Government. (15) The Saudi Government propose that the operation of Article lh should he restricted to foreigners, since the movements of nationals are governed hy Article 11 as given in the Jedda draft. This seems logical. (16) Only the A r ahic language is mentioned in the Jedda draft. On this point see the covering despatch. The schedule . (17) Paragraph ^(Ara’if) is just as it has been drafted ny Shaikh Yusuf, who asserts that it represents exactly the arrangement at present in force between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. His Majesty’s Legation did not notice until Yusuf v asin had left Jedda that his draft mentioned only camels, not animals in general. (18; Paragraph 4 of the Schedule provides that if a murder is intentional the penalty shall he the execution of the offender, notthe payment of blood money. The Saudi Govern ment claim that this is the procedure which is followed in a 13- cases in Saudi territory. They recently objected because blood money was paid to the relatives of a Saudi national who had been murdered deliberately in Trans-Jordan by Trans-Jordan nationals and said that the murderers should / have■PPMHHHl u 0} Cj have heen executed. It was pointed out to them that the in the Schedule to the Trans-Jordan Bon Voisinage Agreement, and they evidently wish to obviate misunderstanding between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on this point. His Majesty’s Legation consider that in principle the Saudi Government are right. It will be noticed that the calculation of the blood money is to be effected according to the Sharia. (19) In paragraph 7 of the Schedule in the Jedda draft the Saudi Government have inserted a list of the tribes they claim as theirs, and they ask that a list of the Kuwait tribes should be added. (20) Article 8 in the Jedda draft has been added by Shaikh Yusuf, who states that this also simply records in writing a well-known and accepted principle. The title 'Losses' has been put in inverted commas in the English translation because it is alleged to be the accepted term for property (usually in animals) which disappears, whether it has been lost or stolen. The drafting is not very good, but perhaps it is near enough for the purpose. decision was in accordance with the Blood-Money provision Q■ ' nolosure No* 3 in Jedda despatch No. 51 dated March 19th., Notes on the dra i ^ .r^d l t ion Agreement (March 8th. 1939). {!) The quest i^n u' ooiitical crimes (Article 3) has given much trouble. The Saudi Government say that nothing should be left to the courts&gt; since Sharia lawyers have as many opinions as there are individuals as to what constitutes a political offence. At first they wished to include all offences ’’against the government authorities” among the non-extraditable offences, but in the end they replaced this p .rase by the words ’'against the local authorities” which thcj had found in Article 6 of the extradition treaty between Iraq, and Egypt (a copy of this article is attached to this 1 ' y * They claim that in this matter Iraq, had granted better terms to Egypt than to Saudi Arabia, and Shaikh Yusuf fasin went to far as to allege that Iraq, had refused to widen the scope of the term ’’political offence” in the extradition treaty of 1930 with the deliberate intention of sheltering as many criminals from Saudi Arabia as possible. Ibn Saud appears to be determined that Kuwait shall not be used in this way. But the words ’’local authorities” are rather vague. Shaikh Yusuf gives as examples resistance to the police or the frontier guards. (2) Smuggling is included in the list of offences, in Article 3, for which extradition shall be granted, but it is explained in the draft letters attached that this only applies to the case where a suspected smuggler who is not a Kuwaiti escapes from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait territory. / (3) ={■j) A second pair of draft letters explain that offences commonly committed by the beduin shall not be considered pclitical offences. Ihese drafts follow closely letters annexed to the Saudi-Iraq Extradition Treaty of 1930. (4) The Saudi Government have proposed the excision of Article 4 (2) in the Kuwait draft, which requires that all the documents included in the demand for extradition shall bear the seal of the competent authority. Their argument is that this does not suit the Saudi form of administration, and that since the demand will be presented by the Govern ment of Saudi Arabia or the Government of Kuwait, which will s^and responsible for it, the matter of seals on individual documents is of no importance. It is true that the courts have no independence in such matters here, but if it is desired to restore the provision about seals, we could quote a similar provision in the Saudi-Iraq Extradition Treaty. (s) Article 5 in the Jedda draft is new: it has been inserted at the request of the Saudi Government. It seems a useful provision.V \ (J«dd« draft» March 6th.» u j / N ^- Agreement of Friendship a n d Bon Volelnage between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the Amirate of Kuwait.

I am not telegraphing, as it does not seem necessary for you to raise the subject with Faisal. He may mention it, as Ibn Baud did, to hasten the conclusion of the Agreement, but he will hardly want to go into detail. It seems unlikely that the King has changed his mind about the inseparability of the Trade Agreement from the other two, but I will get on with the Trade Agreement as soon as I receive the Arabic text, which should be in five or six days, and if an opportunity occurs I may suggest that it should go through and become operative without the other two; but I fear that this suggestion wou3d not be welcomed.

My dear Peel, Many thanks for your letter of the 21st January regarding the Saudi-Koweit Trade Agreement. 2. You will have seen from our telegram No. 22 of the 5th February to Jedda (a copy of v/hich was sent to you officially) that it appears desirable that the Trade Agreement should take the same form as the other Agreements. I now enclose a draft preamble and a draft termination clause of the Trade Agreement for your concurrence. 3. There is one other point regarding the English text ol the Trade Agreement. In the second paragraph of Article 1, the words 'Persons entering Koweit territory 'from Saudi Arabia and taking out goods, etc.' read as if these persons were taking goods from Saudi Arabia to Koweit. It is, however, obvious that the paragraph refers to persons who enter Koweit territory to buy supplies and take those supplies/supplies back with them to Saudi Arabia. We think therefore that to make the meaning clearer these words should be amended to read: 'Persons entering Kov/eit 'territory from Saudi Arabia and leaving again with 'goods bought, etc.'. This is a more literal translation of the Arabic and there would therefore be no need to change the Arabic text. 4.

'3. I leave it to your discretion to suggest this if a suitable opportunity occurs. 4. It seems desirable that Trade Agreement should take same form as other Agreements and appropriate draft preamble and termination clauses will be sent to you as soon as possible. Concurrence of Sheikh of Koweit will have to be obtained in these additions, as in body of agreement, oefore communication to Saudi-Arabian Government. 5o According to your telegram No. 81 of March 25th 1938 ^ only 5.CO p.m.2 4-. 1 U i. P^Y^-n- 1 ' only outstanding point in body of Trade Agreement is definition of ‘’caravan'. There is also the Question of completing Article 7 by inserting lists of customs posts, as to which views of Saudi-Arabian Government are required. 6. It would be useful if you could make progress on these two points without waiting for other developments. 7. In addition, English (but not Arabic) of second paragraph of Article 1 needs a slight change to make it clear that goods 'taken out' are going from Koweit to Saudi-Arabia and not vice versa . Instructions will follow. 8. Arabic texts of all three Agreements have now been received here from Koweit and are being sent to you by bag of February 2nd. If you and Political Resident agree in regarding all these Arabic texts as adequate, His majesty's Government will for their part accept them. 9. If you recommend that initiative should be taken in broaching any of these matters while Emir Feisal or Fuad Hamza are here please let me know.

The efforts made by the Koprosent^tives of His iiajeety's Oovernaent in this matter deserve appreciation and gratitude. These efforts strengthen the mutual friendly ini cordial relations which exist between His 'Majesty's Governnaent their 4rab friends. There are some observations which I wish to point out to you, as although tries© observations are non-osssntiai to the Agreements, yet I consider that they should be touched upon. (1) Paragraph (a) of Article l of the Trade Agreement says in respect of goods exported from Kuwait by land, *Any person who is not with a caravan shall be regarded as a smuggler, even if he hae a manifest* hat/-to you, 'That is -asant *by the word •Caravan * ? That number oan proj&gt;erly be on lied with tills name* Here the minimum limit Tor the number of oar a van people is to be fixed so that thero will be no complications in regard to this point in future, (2) 1‘eragraph (d) of the same rtiole, ‘Versons entering Kuwait territory from Saudi \rabia to buy eiCOdii for their own consumption amt -- 1 .'■ «■—, travel in parties and conform to the contitions laid doirci on oeonerelel caravans, ■ Althougti this par^gr?»ph can easily be applied to the townsmen* its application to the bedouins of the desert will o»uee great confusions and difficulties for them, as it is not easy for them to collect and fora n caravan owing to their apeediy movements am numerous reslienoes and destinations. To this may be added the fact that tneir own requirements tre nearly always ussrarthy and of a low cost, (3) It is desirable that the free movement defined In article 0 of the Agreement for the Promotion of friendly and Good l;eighbouly halations /between the Two States t should cover those who move on botii sides of the ^ A _ frontiers for hunting and halving as well aa the messenger who goea to a fixed destination in order to collect a debt owed to him by anyone on the otner side of the frontier or any other personal b^iness. Article 9 should, therefore, apply to the hunter's and messenger* as far as free movement is concerned# These are my obearv^tioiia which I am submitting Usual ending.yw pUtwH* 0 (E 7802/465/25) Immediate * We are sending you separately under cover of our official letter a 7802/465/25 of the 13th January, a copy of a despatch from Bullard about the changed attitude of the Saudi Arabian Government towards the conclusion of the Saudi-Koweit Agreement. 2. We hope that it will soon be possible to obtain the Sheikh of Koweit’s concurrence in what seem to be the only outstanding points in ,'regard to the Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements, i.e. whether they are to be concluded by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Sheikh, and if so how, and that the Arabic texts will soon reach Bullard from the political authorities in the' Persian Gulf. 3.

It is good news that the hody of !hoth drafts was accepted, and that exception was taken hy the Council (not altogether unexpectedly) only to the preambles, which as you know had been deliberately drafted so as to emphasise the responsibility of H.M.G. for the external relations of Koweit. The Council's redraft reveals an unwillingness to acknowledge this position. It may not be a bad thing that the issue has arisen at this early stage of the Council's exist ence, since if we can secure the acceptance of the formula of our drafts we shall have gone a long way to clarify H.M.G*s position in the eyes of the Council. At the same time it is important that officially we should deal only with the Sheikh, particularly so in order to disabuse the Council of their pretensions (as indicated in Article 3 of the'Inaugural Law') to authority in the sphere of Koweit's external relations. (Please see in this connexion para. 2 of the letter No. P.Z.6062/38 which we sent to Fowle on the 30th September after consulting you.

Dear Peel, Your letter P*Z«6629/38 of 28th September enclosed a copy of a comraunication from the Government of India to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Koweit about frontier relations and extradition to be shown to the Sheikh of Koweit* 2* If no report has yet been received as to the attitude of the Sheikh towards these agreements, would it be possible for a telegraphic enquiry to be addressed to the Political Resident? If only because of the increasingly serious situation with regard to smuggling from Koweit into Iraq (see our letter E 5705/75/91 of 19th October), it is clearly necessary that every effort should be made to push on towards the consummation of our efforts to raise the asking him to arrange for the draft agreements Saudi/FILE COPY 3&lt;j / &gt;1 5 j 'ioA j / u » Confident ial^ jr ’ -&gt; Office of the Political Resident Li a w ’w ^ in the Persian Oulf, 'ly?

I thought it best in the first instance to give the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements unofficially to the Shaikh in order to test his reactions. He consulted the Council unofficially. In this connection it must be remembered that while the question of these treaties is one of external affairs, and therefore outside the scope of the Council, we cannot of course prevent the Shaikh consult ing his Council concerning such questions. This in fact would be the normal procedure of Rulers in the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, where Councils already exist, though hitherto not of the official complexion which prevails at Kuwait. 3. a couple of days later the Shaikh informed me unofficially that both he aa d the Council were in favour of all the clauses of both treaties except the preamble in each, which the Council wished to alter as follows. Bon Voisinage / Peel Ssquire, M.C., The India Office, London, 28 OCT1938 INDIA OFFICE*• 2 - Bon Voiainage * The Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia being desirous of prombting and mintaining friendly relations and good neighbourliness between the Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia have agreed as follows t«* and they have for this purpose appointed authorised representatives on their behalf* fi'or His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait, H*Eo $ His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Jedda, bearing the title of For His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia Sxtradition * The Government ox Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia as they are desirous for completing an agreement about the extradition of offenders and fugutives etc.etc, 4# The Shaikh did not express his own opinion as to this suggestion of the Council, and at this stage I did not think it advisable to ask him for it, or to express W opinion as to the Councils emendation. I contented iqyself tnerefore with saying that it was satisfactory (which of course it is) that both he so d the Council were in favour of the terms of the treaties. *&gt;• With regard to the Council , s proposed amendment neither/neither de Gaury nor I think tlmt we should accept it as it obviously and publicly (the treaties when made will be over the foreign relations of Kuwait# If His Majesty^ Government concur I suggest that de Gaury should take up the matter again unofficially with the Shaikh and get the latter to endeavour to persuade the Council to withdraw their amendment# de Gaury could point out that this amendment ignores the special position of His Majesty’s Government under which the latter control the foreign relations of Kuwait, de Gaury could add that the Saudi Government themselves had recognised this position by conducting the negotiations for the Trade Agent with His Majesty’s Govern ment and by asking the latter to arrange for the Bon Voisinage and Extradition treaties. It is quite possible that the Shaikh may be able to persuade the Council without difficulty since de Gaury is of opinion that the Council’s move is probably a n ry on”. If the Shaikh succeeds in this then the way is clear for sending him an official letter as indicated below. I do not think that in this matter we should have any direct relations with the Council though this would not preclude a friendly talk over a cup of coffee between de Gaury and Abdulla al Salim, the President of the Council. 6. if the Shaikh cannot persuade the Council, or professes to be unable to do so, then de Gaury should send published) ignores the control of His Majesty’s Government him the drafts of the treaties under a brief official forwarding letter, making no mention of course of the unofficial /-4- unofficial conversations which have taken place* 7* The prospect of the lifting of the blockade and of the revival of trade with Saudi Arabia is of course extremely popular in the town, and there is little likeli hood of the Council getting any popular support should they attempt to delay a settlement over what would appear to the majority of Kuwaitis as a mere fom of words. * I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and giving one to de Cauiyo * sent under Printed letter No. c/812 of the 20th October 1938.Dear GiDson, Would you please refer to your official letter P.Z. 6562/38 of the 14th September on the subject of Saudi- Koweit relations? 2. We have no further observations to offer and the way now seems clear for the action proposed in paragraph 6 of your letter of the 23rd July to the Government of India (P.Z. 4206/38), We hope that the Sheikh*s concurrence will be quickly secured, as we are anxious that negotiations with the Saudi Arabian Government should start as soon as possible. You will remember that the Sheikh offered to open negotiations with Iraq as soon as the Saudi blockade was lifted, and we have just received a desx^etch from our Charge d*Affaires in Bagdad (a copy is being sent to you officially) in which he reports further renresentations from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject ofol controlling smuggling from Koweit territory ~seems essential that no time should he Iqst in the obstacle of the Sarudi blockade.

The drafts forwarded by ivI r. Caroe have been considered in detail in consultation with the Foreign Office and with Sir Trenchard Fowle during the latter’s period of deputation in London and I am now to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of the drafts in the form in which, subject to their viev/s and to any further views which the Political Resident may wish to express, H.M.g. consider that they should be submitted ifor the concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit or for any observations which he may have to make on their detailed provisions. 3. Of these drafts the draft 6474a Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP '■bon/■■H ■5 u 'bon voisinage agreement, excluding the schedule, is, with one inconsiderable +exception, in the fom in which Sir Trenchard Powle concurred v/hile in London in April. The 'general rules' forming the schedule to the draft were prepared subsequently by the Foreign Office on the basis of the schedule attached to the 'bon voisinage' Agreement of 1933 between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. They have not yet been seen by the Political Resident, and if the local Political Authorities consider that any important modifications are required I am to ask that the matter may be referred to the Secretary of State. 4. The draft extradition agreement in its present form has also not yet been fa ^ i n cy: iX v. kM** 4* +/viz. Article 12, which Sir T. Powle misunderstood^ seen by the Political Resident, and I am to enclose for consideration a copy of the demi-official letter with v/hich it was received from the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State is content to leave it to the Government of India to decide, in consultation with the Political Resident whether it is desirable to amend Article 4 in the direction indicated by the Foreign Office, and v/hich of the alternative forms of Article 7 should be adopted. I am to ask, hov/ever, that (as in the case of the Schedule to the 'bon voisinage' agreement) reference may be made to him if in other d/-27th April Z.2973/387 respects/Department respects any substantial modification of the draft is thought necessary. 5. It will he observed that the drafts of both agreements have been cast in the form of an agreement made by H. M. G. in the U.K., 'acting in their own name and on behalf of H. H. the Sheikh of Koweit'. Explicit expression is thus given to the acceptance by H. M. G. of responsibility for the fulfilment of the obligations described in the agreements. This responsibility derives from the control exercised by H.m.G. over the foreign affairs of Kov/eit by virtue of which - and in evidence of which- the present agreements are being mediated by them with the Saudi Arabian Government. am to enquire whether in the circumstances the Government of India and the Political Resident see any objection to the proposal that H. M.G.^ by concluding agreements with the Baudi Arabian Government in this form should explicity undertake responsibility for the fulfilment by the Sheikh of the obligations v/hich he would assume. It would of course be most desirable that^in order to ensure the discharge of H.M.G. ’ s responsibility for the observance of the agreements by the Sheikh/Sheikh^hie formal approval of the draft texts should he obtained before signature together v/ith his undertaking MiiKxtaklRg to observe their provisions. It is also advisable that H.M. G. should have his request (as distinct from his authorisation) to^egotiate, and subsequently to conclude, the agreements on his behalf. 6. I am accordingly to request that, when the terms of the enclosed drafts have been settled as indicated in paras.3 and 4 above, the Government of India may instruct the Political Resident to communicate the drafts to the Sheikh of Koweit^to consult him on the substanci of their pmisions and to seek his concurrence in H. M. G^’s proposal to &gt; negotiate with the Saudi Arabian Government on these lines. Subsequently&gt; and before the agreements were concluded, it would be necessary, if the Government of India and the Political Resident agree to the procedure proposed in this letter, to obtain from the Sheikh a formal communication, in the form of an exchange of notes with the Sheikh which would be drafted in consultation with the Foreign Office, conveying his approval of the terms, his request to H.M.G. to conclude the agreements/time he should be asked to undertake to nominate the Political Agent, Koweit, as one of the Koweit members of the Permanent Frontier Commission referred to in Article 13 of the ”bon voisinage” agreement. 7. A copy of this letter and enclosures is being sent to the _ Political Resident and to the Political Agent in Kov/eit. (Sgd.) R. PEEL l|j ' 9(E 3048/465/25) i L 4206 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 15th June, 1938. My dear Gibson, Many thanks for your letter P.Z of the 23rd May regarding the draft Saudi-Koweit agreements. 2. Subject to the observations below, we agree generally with the proposals contained in your letter and in Fowled note of the 21st April. 3. As regards the ‘’General Rules” referred to in Article 7 of the draft bon vois i nage agreement, these might follow the lines of the schedule attached to the bon voisinage Agreement of 1933 between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. I have prepared a draft based on the 1933 schedule, with the necessary modifications to suit the present agreement. Although there is no reason why any changes v/hich are desired should not be made in it, it may at least serve as a basis for an eventual schedule. If, however, the local Political authorities wish to make any important/ J.P.Gibson Esq. ,important modifications in the draft, they might he asked to refer them home for final approval before approaching the Sheikh. e*. /&lt;o_* to ^u-e-oC^f^ paragraph 2 of his note I see that Fowle L J v L - envisagee] the necessity of obtaining the Sheikh’s v/ritten authority for His Majesty’s Government to conclude agreements with the Saudi Arabian Government on his behalf. We have come to the conclusion that, from the international point of view, there is no need to obtain any written authority from the Sheikh, because His Majesty’s Government control his foreign affairs and are internationally responsible for his actions including his performance of this proposed agreement* But since His Majesty s Government are assuming a particular and clearly defined responsibility, it seems proper and prudent that they should reinsure themselves by obtaining the Sheikh s prior approval of the draft texts, and his promise to observe their provisions. At the same time it seems to us to be neither essential nor indeed advisable that this approval., which could be provided in an exchange of notes, should take the form of an official authorisation for His Majesty’s Government to conclude the agreements, though a re quest to/to conclude them would be all right. As indicated above, we think that such authorisation is, strictly speaking, unnecessary. In fact what we propose'here is much the same Ov as the procedure observed when His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom conclude an agreement binding a self-governing territory such as Southern Rhodesia though in this case the promise by Southern Rhodesia to observe is implicit not express. -Fewlrei-e- opinion that His Majesty^ Government will not be responsible for the observance by Koweit of the terms of the Agreements. On the contrary, we think that, in whatever form the Agreements may be concluded, it is His Majesty’s Government who are ultimately responsible for their execution by the Sheikh. In this respect it makes no difference whether they are concluded as governmental agreements or in any other f&lt; fair draft of the Agreement (as well as of the Schedule already mentioned) embodying your various suggestions. It will be seen that we do not agree with 6 • For the sake of clarity, I enclose a complete—AGREimNT FOR THE PROMOTI jN OF FRIENDSHIP AND g&gt;od neighborly relations between Kuwait and SAUDI ARABIA. The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter called the Government of the United Kingdom), acting in their own name and on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Kuwait, of the one part, and the Government of Saudi Arabia, of the other part, being desirous of promoting and maintaining friendship and good neighbourly relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdom of Kuwait, have agreed as follows: Article 1 . (1) Permanent peace and firm and inviolable friendship shall prevail between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdom of Kuwait. (*) The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Kuwait, on the one hand, and/and the Government of Saudi Arabia, on the other, undertake to use their utmost endeavours to preserve these rel tions and to settle in a spirit of pence and friendship all disputes and differences which may arise between them. Article (1) In order to give effect to the unde taking given in paragraph (a) of the preceding Article the Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Kuwait will endeavour by every means in their power to prevent the use of either of their respective territories as a b^se for unlawful acts (including raiding) or preparations therefor, which may be directed against the peace and tranquillity of the territory of the other. Article a. (1) The Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Kuwait shall appoint frontier officers, who shall be responsible for the organisation of general frontier co-operation and for carrying out/CSCMMS out the measureB neceBLary to ensure the application of the provisions of this Agreement, and the two Governments shall notify each other of the names of the persons appointed for this . purpose through the British Legation at Jedie. ( 2 ) These frontier officers, or such persons as may he acting on their behalf, shall have the right to communicate with each other for the purpose of frontier co-ooeration as provided in Articles 4,5,6,7,8 and 9 below and with a view to the settlement of questions arising from time to time on the frontier or between the tribes* Article 4. The frontier officers specified in Article 3 shall exchange information immediately regarding any incidents occurring on either side of the frontier which may affect the maintenance ^ — — “'he other side. one of the frontier officers specified in Article 3 learns of preparations being made in his territory by an armed person, or by armed persons, with the object of V/ Article 5 committing/committing acts of robbery or plunder or raiding or any other unlawful act of euch a nature as to disturb the peace on the frontier between the two territories, he shall inform the other thereof* (^) If it should apnear that this information will not arrive in time to admit of warning being given to those liable to be injured by the aggression, the infonaation must be given in addition to the persons or tribes threatened. Article 6 .

As regards the former we would propose to follow the lines of your Draft E in preference to any of the others. Powle, whom we were able to consult during his recent visit, agrees, and we would be glad to have your comments on the enclosed copy of a note setting out his views. I also enclose a copy of Symon’s note to which Fowle’s note refers. Notwithstanding Eowle 1 s comments (paragraph 7 of his Note) we think that Article 12 should be retained, but subject, if you agree, to the omission of the words 'and shall discourage their intention of doing so' . 3. As regards the Extradition Agreement the terms of your revised draft seem generally suitable, but in this T. Y. Brenan, Esq., O.B.E., Foreign Office, S.W.l. mat t er/matter we have not had the benefit of Powle’s views and we feel that we must leave it to him to say (a) whetiidi it is necessary to tighten up Article 4 on the lines suggested in paragraph 2 of your letter, and (b) which of the two alternative forms about the Koweit heutral Zone should be adopted. 4 . On receipt of your reply to this letter we propose to send copies of the two agreed Drafts to the Government of India and subject to any observations which they may have to offer and to any further comments from Powle, tne next step will be to make an approach to the Sheikh oi Koweit.

Apart from obtaining the Sheikh’s approval to the actual terms of the two Agreement and his written authority for His Majesty's Government to conclude the Agreements with the Saudi Government on his behalf, it seems advisable to obtain his prior promise nominate the local political Agent as one of the Koweit members of the Permanent Frontier Commission referred to in/0) j 0 3. in Article 13 of the draft bon voisinage Agreement.

A ' V) ol' ^ My dear Gibson, ZLt-Z'i With reference to my letter E 465/465/25 of the 6 th April on the subject of the draft bon voisinage agreement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit, I now send you a revised draft, v/hich we have prepared here, of the proposed Extradition agreement. We shall be happy at any time if necessary to discuss with you the texts of both these proposed agreements. 2. There is one point v/hich our Treaty Department have raised in connexion with Article 4 of the Extradition agreement. As the text stands in cur revised draft it will apparently suffice for either of the two Governments concerned to send in an authentic requisition for the surrender of a fugitive offender without supporting the requisition with any legal evidence that the crime, for which extradition is sought, has in fact been committed. There is so far as we are aware, no objection to this per se since J.P. Gibson, Esq.~ 28 APR IS 58 ! _!_• i I/n Or • H : = ' isince we understand it is a fact that a number of countries, unhampered by legal requirements such as Habeas Corpus, are prepared to surrender fugitives from justice on the strength of a mere requisition. It may not be practicable or desirable from the point of view of local conditions to tighten up this provision but the omission seems to invite precisely that kind of spurious /* requisition which Fowle anticipates on page 4 of hie note, a copy of--which was-attached- to y ou-rt-o- me—of 23nd January. If it is nevertheless thought desirable to tighten up the article in this respect we suggest it might be sufficient to add to sub paragraph (b) the words 'together with the original depositions or affirmations of 'all witnesses, or authentic copies thereof' or something of a similar nature appropriate to local conditions. 3. You will also see that we have proposed an article to cover the Neutral Zone, with two alternative forms of which we prefer the second, although without a knowledge S/rtW- ^ // tfc/-. 57 — 7 k. ftUu /Ufy, v&lt; rf ^ InJ 1L&gt; 8*^^ u .

The Government ol* Saudi Arabia and The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, acting in their own name and on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit, Being desirous of concluding an agreement relative to the surrender of offenders,fugitives from justice, who escape from the Kingdom of Saudi-Arabia into the Sheikhdom of Koweit, or from the Sheikhdom of Koweit into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Have agreed as follows: Article 1.

Article 4. (l) A demand for extradition shall be addressed by the Government of Saudi Arabia or the Government of Koweit, as the case may be, to the other Government through the British Legation in Jedda, and be accompanied by the following documents (a) A description of the offender and any information available for his identification.

(2) All the above documents shall bear th€ seal of the competent authorities. Article 5. No person shall be surrendered under this Agreement for any offence committed previously to the date of its coming into force. Article 6. (l) No offender surrendered under this Agreement shall be tried for any offence other than one in respect of which his surrender was I applied for unless he has first been given a reasonable opportunity to leave the country and has failed to avail himself thereof. This provision shall not apply to offences committed after the surrender has been effected. Article 7. (l) For the purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement to that territory (hereinafter termed the Neutral Zone) within the limits of which, as set out in the Nejd-Koweitixvp&amp;l Nejd-Koweit Boundary Convention signed at Uq.air on the 2nd December 1922 corresponding to the 13 Rabi ul Thani 1341, _hoth ^nv^rnm^nt-f*- enjoy equal rights, the following procedure shall be follov/ed (i) where an offence, as described in Article 3 of this agreement, is committed in the territory of either Government and the offender, whichever ♦ his nationality, escapes to the Neutral Zone, he shall be deemed to be still within the territory of the Government in whose territory the offence was committed and he may be arrested and tried by that Government.either Government he shall he deemed to have committed the offence within the territory of the Government in whose territory he then is and he shall he subject to arrest and trial hy that Government and shall not he, in so far as that offence is concerned, subject to - \ f extradition proceedings, 0^ (ii) where an offence, as described in \ Article 3 of this agreement, is committed in the Neutral Zone and the offender escapes to the territory of the Government of which he is a national he shall he deemed to have committed the offence within the territory of, and shall he subject to arrest and trial hy that Government; (iii) where an offence, as described in Article 3 of this agreement, is committedcommitted in the Neutral Zone by a national of one Government and he escapes into the territory of the other Government he shall be deemed to have committed the offence within the territory of the Government of which he is a national and may be the subject of extradition proceedings under this agreement.

IN PAI'JH WHEREOF the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Agreement. Done at Jedda the 1938 corresponding to the day of the month of in the year of the I0 Mr» Gibson I agree that v/e can decide now to adopt draft E subject to the following comments, 2. It will be necessary to have the Sheikh’s approval Government, i do not think that he will raise objections to H.M.G. concluding the agreement on his behalf and it Sheikh to authorise H.M.G. to conclude it on his behalf. As I understand it, H.M.G. do not make themselves responsible that the terms of the agreement will be kept by Koweit. I entirely concur in this though naturally our good offices will be available for adjusting difficulties in an amicable manner. b. With regard to article b, the appointment of Special Officials and para, b of Mr. Symon’s note. I concur that it would be difficult to associate the Political Agent, Koweit, with the day to day work of these officials and likev/ise that it would be equally difficult to withhold the right of these officials to correspond with each other. This correspondence would in writing before the draft is shov/n to the Saudi will then be necessary, as suggested by you, to get the normally/normally 1)31 on unimportant local matters* 4, In regard to article 13, the Permanent Frontier Commission. My original objectiom/to the possibility of direct correspondence between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Saudi Government are met by the phrase in s.(3) 'shall endeavour to settle the matter by discussions through the British Legation at Jeuda'. I regard it as important that the Political Agent should be one of the Kov/eiti members or at any rate associated with the Commission in some way. 1 daresay that as suggested by the F.O. it may be more suitable to arran e for this association as a domestic question with the Sheikh. 5. I note that throughout the draft communications between the two Governments of Saudi Arabia and Koweit pass 'through the British Legation at Jedda'. I presume there is no need to specifically mention the Political Resident, since the normal channel of communication between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Saudi Government is via the Resiaent and the British Legation. 6. Article 9. As Mr. Symon points out in his note this article is more restrictive than the original one, but I do not think that we need, or indeed can, object. All/3. All Governments have the right to restrict the movements of individuals across their frontiers* 7. Article 12 which refers to article 9, unless I have misunderstood it, seems redundant, since article 9 already gives the respective Governments the right of restriction* 8* Article 10, it seems to me, could consist merely of one section beginning with the present s.2 'It shall not be lawful' down to 'of this agreement' (fifth line)* is not lawful for either Government to permit nationals of the other Government to be employed in its armed forces and- surely it follows that neither Government can compel such nationals to enlist* The rest of s.2 would appear to be unnecessary and likewise s.d* 9. On a small point perhaps 'Frontier Officers' would be a more suitable term than 'Special Officials'* i- c ^ C ( f f fMinute Paper Department. P.Z. 2482/38 The original proposal of the Saudi Government was tha'O the suggested n Bon-Voisinage n Agreement^ should he on the lines of the similar Agreement^ between Saudi and Iraq; and so far we * have been working on Hire draft\ based on the text of the Saudi-Iraq Agreement^. As however, the Foreign Office have based their draft (E), which is the one they prefer^on the Saudi-TransJordan Agreement, it may perhaps be assumed that they are satisfied that this wij.1 be acceptable to the Saudi Government; and provided that Sir Trenchard Fowle agrees, it is suggested that we should now consider draft (E) and ignore the others. 2. The first thing to be noticed is that it is now proposed to make the Bon-Voisinage Agreement a governmental Agreement between His Majesty^ Government and the Saudi Government, and presumably this will also be done in the case of the trade and extradition Agreements. Sir Trenchard Fowle will be able to advise whether this arrangement is likely to be acceptable to the Shaikh of Kuwait. 3* We had already reached the conclusion that « it would be virtually impossible^as has been suggested by Sir Trenchard Fowle, to associate the Political Agent, Kuwait ( with the day to day work of the fontier officials. The Foreign Office agree, but ^ir Trenchard Fowle might be asked for a further expression of his views on this point. On aconnected point, the Foreign Office also agree that it would he very difficult to withhold the right of the frontier officials to correspond direct with each other. 4. Sir Trenchard Fowle also suggested that the Agreement should provide for the inclusion of the Political Agent in the permanent Frontier Commission and our draft (B) was worded accordingly. The Foreign Office consider however, that the participation of the Political Agent in the Frontier Commission is a domestic question between His Majesty's Governmen'i and the Shaikh of Kuwait, which is hardly suitable for incorporation in an Agreement of the kind now proposed. We might agree provided that Sir Trenchard Fowle is satisfied that the Shaikh can be persuaded to nominate the Political Agent as one of the two Kuwait officials. If as is assumed, the Shai&amp;h is to be given an opportunity of seeing the draft before it is presented to the Saudi Government, the point might be discussed with him. 5.

Corresponds to Article 5 of draft (A). It will be noted however, that the new Article is more restrictive tha^ the original and specifically provides that in certain circumstances U (4 the freedom of movement might be restricted. Subject to Sir Trenchard Fowled observations, it is suggested that we might accept the new Article. Article 10 . Corresponds to Article 6 of draft (A). } No comments on sub paragraph (1) but sub paragraphs (2) and (3) are new and it is questionable whether they are really necessary; ! but the point is one on which Sir Trenchard Fowle is in the best position to advise. Articles 11 and 12. Correspond to Articles 10 and 11 of draft (A). No comments. Article 13 . Corresponas to Articles 8 and 9 of draft (A).

In this Article it is proposed that the Agreement shall be valid for a period of five years in the first instance. Sir frenchard Fowle might have views on this point.tvs. I . . ji L-. fUjk*&lt; ^Lj 1 v&gt; v /I J FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 6th April, 1938, .TlIS 15 ' (li 465/465/25) Immediate My dear Gibson, I must apologise for having taken so long to deal with your letter P.Z. 8197/37 of the 22nd January about the draft bon voisinage agreement between Saudi Arabia ana Koweit. 2. We have gone into the question with some care here and have as a result evolved three alternative drafts. For convenience I will call the Political Agent’s draft '•Draft (A)' and your own re-draft 'draft (B)'; our drafts therefore become: (G) An adaptation of (B) embodying various amendments. (D) ai adai)tation of (B) which keeps as nearly as possible to the original, on the assumption that it might be desirable not to depart more than is necessary from the terms of the Saudi-Iraq Yigreement; (E)/(E) it complete re-ciraft 'based on the Saudi- Transjordan Agreement of 1933 (cmd. 4691). This last Agreement has the advantage of having 'been drawn up at the time in fairly good legal English, although it is technically only a translation. Even so it needs a considerable amount of alteration to make it suitable. 3. I may say that we prefer (c) to (D), and (E) to either. 4. With regard to the substance of the changes embodied in these various drafts, we think that by making the Agreement a Governmental agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi-Arabian Government we . in n [■m - ti - i r « ^^x-waniiiwriii n m shall be able to get away from the difficulty of having a substantive instrument between two parties brought into force by an exchange of notes between two other parties. e Incidentally, also, we g^t away from the difficulty of having to use the word ’’party” of Koweit. 5. We think it might be rather pointed to omit reference to the first sentence of Article 1 of (a) and as a corresponding provision appears in the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty we have retained it. 6 . I think you will find your observations under -articles 2 and 3 are met in the re-drafts.7. With regard to Article 4 of (B), we doubt whether it is possible to consider the Political Agent in Koweit as one of 'his Majesty’s Representatives'. 8. With regard to your observations on Article 7, you will see that our re-drafts allow for direct consultation between the frontier officials, who are allowed to communicate direct with each other. We can see that there may be disadvantages in allowing such- direct communication to go too far, but it is also difficult to see how the special officers could do their work at all if everything had to be referred to the two Governments in order that communications might pass through the diplomatic channel. It is equally difficult to see how the Political Agent could be effectively associated in their day to day work. On this point your comments seem conclusive. 9. With regard to the participation of the Political Agent in the Frontier Commission, this seems to us to be a domestic question between His Majesty’s Government and 'the Sheikh of Koweit and hardly suitable for incorporation in an agreement with a third party. You will see that provision has been made for all matters which cannot be dealt// ^ / dealt with by the special officers to be dealt with by the diplomatic channel, i.e. ’’through the British Legation 'at Jedda'. 10. We think that your further observations on the Articles of (a) and (B) are met in one way or another in the re-drafts. 11. We hoi&gt;e that out of these various re-drafts it will be possible to evolve a suitable draft for presentation to the Saudi Arabian Government and the Sheikh of Koweit.

Last autumn we received correspondence from Bushire forwarding drafts of a 'Bon Voisinage' and an Extradition Treaty prepared by the Political Agent, Koweit, on the basis of the similar treaties between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Please see the Resident's letter of 19th September, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the 5th October under India Office number P.Z.6550/37. A copy of a later letter (dated 24th September) from the Resident is enclosed herewith. The drafts were shown to Sir Trenchard Fowle while he was in London and I enclose a copy of the notes of his views which he then recorded. It seems desirable to get away from any references to 'treaties' and 'high contracting parties' in these documents which, like the Trade Agreement, will be negotiated by H.M.G. on behalf of the Sheikh and will be embodied in an Anglo- Saudi exchange of notes. The draft 'Bon Voisinage' agreement seems/seems to require rather extensive amendment, I have tried to improve it, without departing too much from the original, in a purely tentative redraft which I enclose. The papers have not yet been submitted to higher authority here, and in any case I think we shall have to consult the Resident, particularly in respect of Article 7, before we can make much further progress. But I should be very grateful to learn your views at this stage. The draft extradition agreement is less unsatisfactory, but you will see that Powle thinks it desirable to amend Article 3 and we should be glad to have your views. Yours sincerely, 1&lt;J) A'C.S.'y- ( f 5 , (i-W ) .FOR :I0!I OFFICK, S. J.I. (8 7339/H3/S6). 22nd.

After consultation with Fowle, we are inclined to think that the next step should be to let the Saudi G-overnmenl know that the Sheikh of Koweit accepts the principle of Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements being linked with the Trade Agreement, and at the same time to ascertain v/hether they are prepared f at the appropriate moment,to sign a Trade Agreement in the form accepted by the Sheikh. If the Saudi Government accept the Revised Draft Trade Rog^ilatione the question of the other Agreements can be taken up. Fowle thinks, and we agree, that it would be better to try and get complete agreement about the Trade Regulations before going too deeply into the question of the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements. 3. On a point of detail, we agree that the definition of 'caravan’' in Article 1 DEPT. INDIA OFFICE i «0r'Y SENT TO. of the Trade Agreement should include motor cars, and this might be mentioned to/to the Saudi Government when the revised draft is submitted to them. ^ G\BSOt^&gt;x Mr.Symon Re our discussion as to the next step to be taken. I think that this should take the form of forwarding the Trade Agreement draft as approved of by the Shaikh of Kuwait (vide my letter of 12th July, P*Z.5746) to the Saudi Government. If they agree well and good, and the question of the further Treaties of Friendship and Extradition can be taken up. If they do not agree then these two Treaties do not come into the picture. The Trade Agreement is really the crux of the matter - or at all events the first crux. (Sd.) T.C.Fowle 12.10.37.fzr. 6 sso/3Yj I am am keeping a copy of this for Bu shire file. I VCv.cX.A4 ^ 'Jtn+rL Mr.Symon . In continuation of my previous note of the 11th October on the subject of the Kuwait Saudi Treaty of Friendship Herewith my comments on Captain de Saury*s draft of the Kuwait Saudi Extradition Treaty. Articles 1 to 3 are muta tis mutandis the same as the corresponding articles of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 3 seems to cover offences, i.e. brigandage, theft, etc., which are so far as I know not generally considered as political” offences (see first sentence of this article). I I think the offences covered by this article might be restricted (see my comments in para.2 below). Article 4. The demand for extradition by either Government has to be made through H.M.G.*8 representatives. This is quite correct and short circuits direct correspondence between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh. (Since both Governments in so far as demands for extradition are concerned are covered by Article 4 there is no need for an article in the Kuwait Saudi Treaty corresponding to Article 5 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty.) Articles 5 and 6 are the same as Articles 6 and 7 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 8 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. There is no corresponding article in Captain de Gaury’s draft. This article contains the important proviso that the treaty shall remain in force for a period of three years,after which it can be abrogated by either side. In the Iraq Saudi Treaty of Friendship no time limit is laid down. 2. I must confess I do not feel very happy over there being an Extradition Treaty at all between Kuwait and/n'wwmu xiwanwro a and Saudi Arabia. As you are aware political refugees from the Saudi Government take refuge in Kuwait not necessarily in the town but amongst the Bedouin in Kuwait territory. In order to get these individuals extradited the Saudi Government will probably trump up offences of brigandage etc. against the refugees. The Sheikh may refuse to deliver up the persons concerned and we shall inevitably be drawn into the squabble. I think,therefore, in order to minimise this risk that the definition of ixtrixcLitAblt. polit4oal- offences in Article 3 (see my comments above) might be considerably narrowed.0 I have taken a c opy of this fo r thjt JBushi] Vnt. i&gt; UccacXva S* Treaty of Friendship be tween Saudi Ara bia ancf^Kuwait. Re Captain de Gaury^g draft Article 1 is the same mutatis mutandis as Article 1 of the Iraq Saudi Arabia Treaty. No comments. (Article 2 of the Iraq Saudi Arabia Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Articles 2 and 3 are the same as Articles 3 and 4 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. No comments. Article 4 is the same as Article 5 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. For comments see below. Article 5 is the same as Article 6 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty except naturally for the opening sentence down to 'Bahra Agreement'. See comments below. Articles 5 and 7 are the same as Articles 7 and 8 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. See comments below. Article 8 is the same as Article 9 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. See comments below. Article 9 is the same as Article 10 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty down to 'respective governments for decision'. Thereafter the exception noted in the Iraq Saudi clause under the Bahra Agreement is naturally left out. no comments. (Article 11 of the Iraq ttaudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Article 10 is the same as Article 12 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. No comments. Article 11. Down to 'without obtaining previous permission” this article is the same as Article 13 oi tne Iraq Saudi Treaty. A further reference to the Bahra Agreement in Article 13 is naturally left out of Article 11 which/2 which goes on 'subject to the provisions ' down to 'hy its permission'. In Article 11 I think that after 'previous permission' might be added 'from the Authorities referred to in Article 7'. The sentence in Article 11 'subject to the provisions.... by its permission' might be left out. So far as I know there are no other agreements concluded between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. (Article 14 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Article 12 is the same as Article 15 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty down to 'concluded between them'.Thereafter H.M.G. are made the arbitrators. The provisions of Article 16 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty are not provided for by Captain de Gaury. Some such final article would have to be added to the Kuwait Saudi Treaty and would, I suppose, record the fact that the treaty was being made by H.M.G. on behalf of Kuwait. 2. In addition to the above remarks my general feeling about Captain de Gaury 1 s draft is that we do not come at all into the picture. (l) Article 4. As you are aware we attach considerable importance to preventing the Sheikh from having direct correspondence with Ibn Saud but Article 4 gives the right to both parties to notify (i.e. correspond with) each other on certain matters. It is true that these matters are limited to highway robbery, raiding, etc., but correspondence has a way of extending beyond its original limits and I think we should soon find the Sheikh and Ibn Saud corresponding freely on all sorts of political questions. In fact my own opinion is that one of the objects of the Saudi Government in tagging on this treaty and that on Extradition to the Trade Agreement (the other object was to delay the latter coming into force) was to increase Saudi influence in Kuwait by getting into direct touch with the Sheikh. There would seem to be/be two ways in which we can come into the picture in regard to this article (a) by inserting in the clause a proviso that correspondence between the Sheikh and the Saudi Government should pass through the Political Agent in Kuwait; or (b) by arranging with the Sheikh that all such correspondence should be shown to the Political Agent. (2) . Article 5. 'Musabila” is one of the obstacles ,from the Saudi point of view,to the Trade Agreement. However, there is no objection to mention of Musabila for the present in the draft. (3) . Article 7. I think we ought to associate the Political Agent somehow or other with the 'competent authorities'. As a precedent for this you will remember that the Political Agent, Kuwait, was recently associated with an official of the Iraq Government in the investigation of certain Kuwait Iraq frontier incidents. In order to secure this association a proviso to that effect would have to be inserted in this clause. (4) . Article 8. Similarly we ought to associate the Political Agent with the Frontier Commission especially in view of the wide scope of this Commission as laid down in Article 9. 3. In insisting with the Sheikh and the Saudi Government that we should be associated in some form or other with the activities on which the success of the Treaty would largely depend we are, I think, on strong ground. In the first place the Treaty will be made on behalf of the Sheikh of Kuwait by H.M.G. who are responsible for the foreign relations of Kuwait. In the second place in case of serious differences over the implementing of the Treaty/4 Treaty arising between the Sheikh and the Saudi Government the latter will undoubtedly apply to us for assistance, and we would be in a much better position to smooth matters over if we had been kept informed by the Political Agent of the rights and wrongs of the matter in dispute from the beginning. Further, the Political Agent by being associated with the Frontier authorities will often be able to influence both sides to settle questions amicably on the spot. 4. We might discuss the whole treaty question some time.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Confident ial 0 Department. i 671 Q • . / ; 07 1 ' olC, 6 * 'S37 1 EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). [N.B.
