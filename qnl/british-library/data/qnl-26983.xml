I caused this explanation to be embodied in a letter to the head of the Lconomios Secuion of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and X am now glad to be able to inform you that I have received two official communications from the Ministry copies of which are enclosed, stating that permission to import these articles has now been granted by the Council of Ministers and inviting formal application for the necessary licence. I enclose a copy of a note which X have addressed to Feroughi thanlcing His Highness fear hie intervention in this matter. This case constitutes a useful precedent for the practical Interpretation of the relevant article in the Telegraphs Agreement, though matters of this nature depend chiefly on the desire to be helpful or to be obstructive at the Minlsteyy for Foreign Affairs.

It seems to follow, if I may say so, a little too closely Hoare’s observations, which were perhaps not intended to be passed on as they stood to the Communications Company. It is, however, difficult to explain the exact points which we should like to be amended, and in these circumstances I enclose, as we arranged, an alternative draft for your consideration. Please alter it in any way you think fit. It is only meant to give you a very rough outline of our views. As regards the question whether Hoare, when he wishes to approach the Communications Company, should approach M. J. Clauson, Ssq.approach their local Persian cable offices, or their man at Karachi, or their head London office we would definitely prefer to retain full discretion, and not to put the point to the Company here, who might well reply that they would prefer all enquiries to he addressed to Karachi* We have therefore omitted most of the paragraph in Anderson 1 s draft which dealt with this point. Perhaps it might he well to send Hoare semi-officially a brief explanation, as in the annexed draft.

I am sorry to say that, so far as we know, this Agreement has not yet been signed. The delay was partly due to a misunderstand ing of a purely technical nature, on the part of the Persian Government, in connexion with the full powers for signing the agreement, and we have not heard that there has been any fresh difficulty about its text We will keep you informed of any further developments. You will recollect that in your letter No. 1.10531 of the 7th October you stated that, while not wishing to express a definite opinion on the desirability of trying to secure an amendment in Article 4 Sr- _of the Agreement, you thought it would he unwise to do this if it would cause delay and ^saibly result in a breakdown. You suggested that it might be better to try to secure, preferably in writing, a more favourable interpretation of the present wording of the Article. This suggestion was put to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, whose views on the subject have Mr. Hoare feels that further discussion of Article 4 , paragraph 2, would be likely to do more harm than good. He agrees that it would not be worth while delaying the signature of the Agreement in an attempt to secure an amendment of the text. The alternative, however, viz. an attempt to secure an agreed interpretation of the present text, is not, in his opinion, likely to result in a conclusive settlement, and in any case the Persian Qovernment would probably be unwilling to now been received commitcommit themselves to a wider intex»pretation of the paragraph than the ordinary sen^e which the words imply* He adds that the attitude of the Persian authorities has recently become more helpful in regard to the importation of stores for your cable stations in the Persian SJulf* If, however difficulties arise in the future, the proper course will be to tatce up with the Persian authorities each case in which they unreasonably exclude an article from the lists submitted to them. In such cases the Company will have to show that the article is 'necessaire au bon *fonctionneraent' of the land lines, cables, or cable stations. I trust that your most recent information with regard to the import of stores for your Persian Gulf stations confirms Mr. Hoare’s impression that the position is now slightly more satisfactory*1 i Jr\ s 64/64/34 Mr. Hoare, Tehran# (Prom Mr. Rendel. ) A iX ■ 9 I ‘V. J anuary Dear Ho&amp;re, We note from paragraph 5 of your despatch No# 656 of November 21st, regarding the importation of stores for the Imperial and International Communication Company’s fcable stations in Persia, that the Company’s nearest official with general authority is at Karachi, and that it is not an easy or speedy matter to communicate with him. Perhaps I should explain that, when our telegram No. 166 of October 28th on this subject was drafted, it was a question whether the London office of the Company should be invited (as suggested by Dodd in his despatch No. 554 of October 6th) to explain the precise purposes for which certain articles were required by their Persian offices. We felt considerable doubt whether any useful purpose would be servedby asking for such an explanation at this end* In the first place, the London office of the Company are not presumably in a position to say what articles are procurable locally from Persia; secondly, it was presumably the Company’s officials in charge of the various cable stations in Persia who, we imagined, were responsible in the first instance for submitting indents for the stores which they required, and they ought therefore to have been better able to say how these stores were going to be used. As regards future difficulties, you will perhaps be best able to obtain information on certain simple questions of fact, e.g. information with regard to the purposes for which certain articles are required, by referring to the Company’s Persian offices* Other more complicated points may have to be referred to Karachi or to London. If you decide that it willbe best that the Company’s London office should be approached on some particular point of importance or of principle, please do not hesitate to let us know.S' Ls*f&gt; } L [This Document is the Property of His Britahnic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] / O' O O / 09/209/34.) lo_..

I am completing the necessary formalities in respect of those items which the Persian Government are prepared to admit and in doing so am indicating that I reserve the ri#it to revert in due course to the remaining items. I have already taken the same action in connexion with the stores shown on list 'A' enclosed in ray despatch under reference (see r^y despatch Bo. 544 of October 1st). 3. Of the items to which the Persian Government take I exception, I am not sure what a 'Goa Broom' is. If,however, fhe Most Honourable , it ihe Marquess of Heading G.C.B., etc., etc., etc..it is an outdoor broom, the Persian frorernment may regard them and the watering pots as articles not required for technical or office purposes (compare the zinc baths, flower seeds etc, excluded from list ”A W in my despatch iJo, 482), These considerations scarcely apply to .methy lated spirits, matches and gum (without which gum blushes and guapot glasses are not much use), but on the other hand these comriidities *re on the list of prohibited imports, while matches are the subject of a monopoly in addition* 4. I venture to suggest that the Company should be invited to explain the precise pur coses for which the excluded items are required, in order that X may, if this is thought desirrhle, make further representations on the subject to the Persian ftoweranoiit* 5.

I’he heads of the Economic and English sections stated that the suggestions contained in a Mote which I had addressed to the Minister for Forei#i Affairs in the sense of the opening sentence of paragraph 8 of my despatch Mo. 482 of September 9th, were still under consideration . they undertook, however, to obtain at once licences for the import of fresh fruit and vegetables at each of the Company’s four stations to the extent of the monthly quotas for October, Movember and December. This has now been done, although the details which v/ould ordinarily be required before such licences could be issued could not be supplied by the Legation and will not in fact be known here until the first batch of applications under the The Most Honourable The Marquess of Heading, G.C.B. etc., etc., etc..

Department. u s s X XX f I There are two matters of importance to the I &amp; I C.C.. dealt with in recent papers on this file. • ( 1 ) the difficulty of importing provisions for their staff resulting from the working of ii &lt; the trade monopoly law - see papas 7 and 8 of Mr Dodd’s despatch of 9th Sept and Mr Anderson’s &lt;, ■ note of 25th Sept, flagged A. This appears to have been satisfactorily disosed of for the time being ( F.O.Telm of 26th Sept. P.Z.6225 and Mr.Dodd’s reply of ^th Oct, P.Z.6407) (2) the interpretation of the passge marked C in Article 4 of the Agreement regarding the exemption of the Company’s stores from Customs duty. The question is what stores are covered (see Mr Anderson’s note of 25th Sept and Mr .Perry’s letter of 7th Qct). The suggestion, in the draft letter to the F.O.seems the best in the circumstances. It will be a relief to get the Agreement signed. It will be remember ed that in our agreement of Aug 1930 with the Company we promised ”to endeavour to secure” the landing rights etc for them by negotiation with the Persian Govt, whereas the Coy under took the definite obligation to maintain cable communications in the G ulf; it was contemplated that if the negotiations failed the Coy could simply disconnect the cables from the landing stations and run them up the Gulf outside Persian waters; when !vr Perry was here on 24thSept, however, he stated that the cables are so old that they could not be moved about, and that failing the landing rights, it would he necessafj to run new cables up the Gulf at great expense, some moral obligation to the Coy to secure the landing rights for them; unfortunately it was necessary for financial reasons to transfer the inland telegraphs to Persia last spring, thus putting them in actual possession of the main advantage which they get from the agreement befoi we has got the agreement signed.* It would be a great mistake from the point of view of the C 03 our own point of view to risk further delay in the signature of the agreement for the sake of a wide interpretation of the provision regarding exemption from customs duty.

After our interview I discussed the question of the Persian Government's objection to the admission into Persia, free of duty, of certain items on the ground that they were not covered in Article 4, with Captain Lawson, and others, and the view expressed was that the Coumunications Company, as Agent of our Government, ought to enjoy the same facilities as applied to the Indo-European Goveriment Telegraph Department. It was felt that the Company, not being a party to the agreement, could not express any definite opinion as to the advisability of re-opening negotiations in order to secure, if possible, any amenckuent of Article 4* Our general feeling is, however, that if, as we now understand, the Persian Government have accepted the G.H.G.Anderson, Esq. ,D.S.O. ,M.C. ^ INDIA % &lt;a a-* ** (r Pp .Jf /4. Y 3,.- 2 - 7th October, 1931 very important points raised by the Company, it would be unwise to adopt a course of action in regard to Article 4 which would cause delay and might result in a breakdown. It was further thought that the course which might comnend itself to you would be for the Charge to endeavour to secure, preferably in writing, a more favourable interpretation of the wording in Article 4:- thus, I think that the word 'materiel' should be held to cover official stores, and as such, all requirements for the 'stations de cable' including those necessary for the reasonable well being of the Staff, such as medical necessities. The Controller of Stores, to whom the list was submitted for coimient, remarks upon the apparently considerable number of new zinc baths, enamel basins, tooth brush dishes, soap dishes, jugs, indented for so soon after the Coumunications Company has taken over, but this of course does not affect the main question of principle vis-a-vis the Persian Government, and I must assume that these articles are part of the equipment of- 3 - 7th October, 1931. the station establisiments, and were formerly provided by the Indo-European Department, although perhaps it would appear that none have been imported recent ly. I am sure that it can reasonably be held that the free inport of vegetable and flower seeds, as well as brandy (which might advantageously have been described as 'medicinal brandy'), Bovril, essence of chicken, and lime juice, is as necessary now as it was in the past. It may be that cocoa and barley are obtainable locally without difficulty. As regards the 'starting' cartridges, to which objection has been taken, these are of course required in connection with starting up the oil engine. Possibly the item may have been incorrectly G.1LG.

Department. 4703A 5000 10/30 On .* - V Note of an Interview with Mr. Perry of I. &amp; I.C. Ltd. Mr. Perry of the Imperial and International Communications Co. called here on the afternoon of the 24th September to discuss the position of the employees of the Company at Jask, Henjam, and other stations in Persia. He left with me the attached copy of correspondence received from Mr. Mungavin, the Company's Manager at Karachi. He expressed great concern as to the position of the staff in Persia, and gave it as his opinion that unless something was done very soon to assist them in securing necessary supplies - particularly food-stuffs - there would be wholesale resignations, and that a position might well arise in which the Company would be unable to maintain the cable-stations at Henjam, Jask, Charbar, etc. Although he thought it probable that some of the Directors of the Company might welcome an excuse to withdraw from these stations, on financial grounds, he, personally, would deprecate such withdrawal, except at the last resort, as being derogatory to British prestige. On being asked whether it might not be possible to cut out Jask, Charbar, etc. ; he observed that the present cable is in such a condition that, unless it were relaid at great exoense, it would be impracticable to employ it as a purely submarine cable, without fairly frequent landing places. As regards para.2 of Article 4 of the draft agreement he interpreted 'le materiel et les appareils necessaires au bon fonctionnement tant de la ligne de terre que des cables et stations de c&amp;ble' to mean, not merely technical equipment, but also all articles supplied by the Company for the use and consumption of the staff.On the other hand, assuming that the Persians do not accept this interpretation, he was not in favour of reopening negotiations in order to secure an amendment of Article 4, since he felt that, now that the Agreement is on the point of being signed, it would be unwise to adopt a course of action which would certainly cause delay and might even result in a breakdown. The attitude of the Company is that they wish if possible to secure that all supplies required for their staff should be admitted free of duty:* failing this, they wish at least to ensure that the provisions of the Trade Monopoly Law do not operate to prevent them from importing - after payment of reasonable customs duty (Mr. Perry was somewhat apprehensive on this point) - all necessary food-stuffs and other supplies. I told Mr. Perry that the Charg 6 d'Affaires at Tehran was fully aware of the difficulties and was attemntirg to overcome them, and that we would approach the F.O. to see whether anything further could be done. T gave him cooies of the two lists of stores annexed to Mr. Dodd* s Despatch of the 9th September, in case the Company had any observations to offer on them.IMPERIAL &amp; INTERNATIONAL COaMJNICATIONS LIMITED KARACHI STATION BLAIBMHL 16th September 1931.

With reference to our KE-19 dated 20th May and our telegram H/Rf June, we are forwarding herewith copies of the undermentioned telegrams for your information. As matters are taking a very serious turn, we would request that early action be taken through the Foreign Office in order to avoid abandonment of Gulf comuni cations. I am informed by the Officer in Charge, Jask, that the attitude of the local persian Officials is positively hostile and in spite of the Persian Government having granted permi ssion for a very inadequate supply of provisions etc. the local Officials are still delaying matters deliberately. It appears to me that the Persian Government is intent on wrecking our Administration altogether with a view to com pelling us to withdraw from the Gulf and thus handing over everything into their hands. The Staff are becoming desperate and under the hardships they are sutfering one cannot but feel that they are justified in demanding transfers, as there is a limit to all human en durance.

The Customs author ities were duly approached, out I do not yet icnow whether the cases have reached the Company. Delay is t however, and it is not inseparable from Persian administration,,with the delay, hut with the nature of the articles vdiich the Persian Government consider Article (4), paragraph 2, to cover, that I am most concerned. 3. Uhe seven cases mentioned in the preceding para graph were eventually admitted without any item being challenged, but when a few weeks later permission was sought for the importation of the articles shown on the attached list 'A*\ denominated 'Official Stores', the ?tinistry for Foreign Affairs raised objection to the inclusion of certain items, notably ooal and coke, and the comprehensive item called 'Brandy, Bovril, essence of Cuicken, XJLaeJuice, Cocoa and Parley'. Considerable oral discussion has since exi- sued as to the right of these items to be admitted as official stores; but as far as can be seen at present the Persian Government, though they have agreed unofficially to coal and coke will insist that all those articles marked shall be withdrawn from the list and a separate application made for them as private stores (see paragraph 7 below). I have since presented to the Ministry for Forei^i Affairs a third list, of which I enclose a copy, marked 'B», consisting mostly of stationery and office stores for }3U8hire, but there has as yet been no reply. 4 ■4. I feel that the question of the olassifioo.tion of these stores should he settled before the agreement is eigM*. X aa disposed, unless the imperial and inter national Communications Company can show satisfactorily tnat such articles em those on list to \diich the -ersian Government object are covered by the phrase in the Convention 'neoessaires au bon fonctionnement ♦•••••••des stations de cable M , to recommend that Your Lordship should consent to their withdrawal. It may be true that Article (4), pjara- graph 2, as at present drafted, does not specify that the stores to be admitted must be technical, equally true that the brandy, soap-dishes, etcetera, may be provided at the expense of the Company for consumption or use by the employees during the course of their duty. At the same time I feel that the Persian Government in accepting the draft article can hardly have been reasonably expected to antici pate that it was designed to cover items such ms these. The objection made to f, 200 starting eartridgea w was doubtless due to a misunderstanding and I shall myself be glad of an explanation of their exact nature in order to obtain their admission. 5. It appears to me that the Company were in hopes that the Persian Government would admit without challenge under the clause in question all articles supplied by the Company for the use and consumption of the staff. This would of course, be a simple criterion, if the Persian Government would adopt it. There is, however, no probability that they will prove so complaisant. It is clear that they considerm*?. -4- consifllep therasalvec l)ouad to \iader th® clans® only articles which they are satisfied oeu be properly character* ised as N teehnioal :T * If they are to be pressed to widen the scope of the clous® either by interpretation or textual aaen&amp;iaent* considerable further delay will be inevitable before the Agreement can be signed; and I under stand that Your Lordship wishes that signature should take plaee as soon as possible. I should perhaps add that no form of v/ords that oould be invented can be counted on as certain to obviate the challenge of individual items in the future* &amp;• In these circumstances I should be glad of Your Lordship 1 ^ instructions as to the interpretation of Article 4 # paragraph 2 of the Agreement in general and in the present instance, which may bo regarded as a test case as to whether I am to insist on the inclusion of the challenged items in the official list. A further question which, although it docs not affect the agreement, affects very considerably the proper maintenance of the cable stations, arises from the diffi culty of obtaining fresh fruit and Vegetables, and other provisions at# the different stations. owing to the workings of the Trade Monopoly Law it is impossible at a place like Jaslc to buy a bunch of bananas off a passing vessel without a license from the Council of Ministers. Sir Robert Clive represented to the jlnlster for Foreign AffairsAffairs as long ago a* May the great hardship whioh this involyed to the employees of the Company in a oountryff where fresh food of good quality, especially fresh fruit and veget hies, is normally unobtainable• ^Phe Persian Government eventually agreed to the importation of pro visions of this kind with the ezncptlon of rice, onions and flour, which were stated to be obtainable in x^ersia {discussion i© still proceeding as to flour)# A new difficulty then arose in that this concession was practically useless, if a license had to be applied for through the .iinistry for Foreign Affairs every time a consignment of food was required at any of the stations# The suggestion was therefore made that monthly cont n- gents should be agreed to for (A) fresh fruit and vegetables and (B) other foodstyffs and a yearly contin gent for (C) other supplies, ouen va clothes, in respect of bu shire, Henjara, Jask tuad Charbar separately: and that within these contingents the local authorities should have authority to admit food and other articles (not necessarily free of duty) without reference to Tehran# It is typical that the Persian Government have now accepted the contingents proposed, amounting to about fifty thou ©sad rupees a year, but still maintain that for each consignment imported a special application by the Legation will be necessary. 8. Such an arrangement is unworkable, in respect of the monthly contingents at any rate, and I am there fore pressing the Minister for Foreign affaire further upon the subject. In the meanwhile the -Persian Govern ment have agreed to the importation without Monopoly Lawr •6 Law restrictions, of some fairly ©xtonsiye rjnd yoried lists which have already been presented on behalf of the Company’s \ staff: the delay has been considerable and is not yet finished I as various formalities have still to be completed, but the Persian Govercnaent have challenged none of the articles except, as mentioned above, rice, onions ana flour* 9* I m sending a copy of this despatch to the for ign \ Secretary to the Government of India and to the Acting poll tic a!

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowHe dge the receipt of Your Highness * note tto. 9420/61012404 of July 6th (Tir 14th) in which you were so good as to inform me that | the necessary permission had been granted for the unrestriotec import of the articles mentioned in the enclosure to Sir Robert Clive's note Bo# 290 of June 8th (Khordad 17th) with the exception of the consignments of flour, rice and onions# jj These commodities, Your Highness suggested, were easily obtainable from Persian sources at the stations in question; I am making enquiries as to the facilities which exist at these places for obtaining such supplies from Persia, and on learning the exact position I shall have the honour to j j address Your Highness further on the subject, in the mean- time I venture to express my gratitude for the steps already taken by your Highness to better the very serious situation eM-aution ■ of the officials concerned* t i 2. In his note Ho. 303 of June 23th Sir Robert Clive enclosed a table showing the estimated value of the monthly requirements of the four stations in fresh fruit and vegetabl© and other foodstuffs and the yearly value of their require ments as regards other supplies for the personal use of the staifs* In view of the decision not to permit the unrestrict—i ed import of flour, rice or onions, the table will now need a certain amount of revision; I am making urgent enquiries His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Perou^ii Ministre for Foreign Affairs. in that- 2 - in that sense and will not fail to address Your Highness again hut in due course on the subject, since there is no doubt/that some form of permanent or serai-permanent authorisation is the only satisfactory method of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, n however, I enclose herewith a list of the personal stores (including foodstuffs) at preeent required by the four stations. This list was received subsequently to the one now sanctioned, and is supplementary to it; I trust that it will be possible for Your Hi^iness to obtain at an early date the necessary import licence in respect of it, since the majority of the items which it mentions are very badly needed by the addressees. 3. The list will be seen to include two radio-concert^ wireless sets of the ordinary type. I hope thet the special permission necessary for the import of these may in the circum- j stances be accorded at the same time as the general import licence for the consignments as a whole, but should there be any special difficulties connected with the issue of such permisdon I would request that the general licence be not delayed on that account, but issued separately in respect of the remaining stores, most of wnich, as I have said, are urgently required. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of ray hi^iest consideration.

Dear Sir, I beg to enclose a copy of a Service sent by me today to the Hobble, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Prom the purport of the enclosed telegram you will see how unbearable the situation is becoming at our Gulf Stations. The Persian Government have recently promulgated an Order forbidding all imports into Persia unless goods to the equivalent value are exported. This is obviously from our point of view impossible. Conditions at our Gulf Stations are not the same as throughout the interior of Persia and at such places as Charbar, Jask and Henjam virtually nothing is procureable. If you could take up this question with the Foreign Office at heme and hint at the possibility of our being compelled to abandon our Lines of cojtiti uni cation throughout the Gulf and thus isolating Iraq, they may be induced to see the serious side of the question.I can assure you that our staff at these stations have had in the past quite enough in the way of hardships to bear, but if the Persian Government are to be allowed to forbid all Imports, this will aggravate matters to such an extent that it will be truly quite impossible to keep any Staff at our Stations* Conditions at Bushire are practically the same, but certain types of vegetables and foodstuffs are prooureable there* It would be advisable if the Laws of the country cannot be changed, that we demand a special concession permitting Imports by the Company and its employees without having to obtain special permits from the central Government at Teheran. Any permit of this nature makes matters impossible, as anything of a perishable nature will long have ceased to be of any value ’ere the permit reaches the Local Authorities* I will keep you informed of any further developments rt this end. ^ours faithfully, (Sgd.) 20.5.31, Manager, I. &amp; I.

The file’s principal correspondents include the India Office (John Gilbert Laithwaite), Imperial and International Communications Limited (J O Stevens Perry), the British Legation at Tehran (Charles Dodd, Lacy Baggallay, Reginald Hervey Hoare), and the Foreign Office (Charles William Baxter, George William Rendel). The shortages were a result of the introduction by the Persian Government of a Trade Monopoly Law, banning the import of goods into Persia without goods of equivalent value being exported in the opposite direction. The correspondence focuses on the wording of the Telegraphs Agreement under negotiation between the British and Persian Governments, classification of official stores, and the issue of import licenses for supplies. The file includes lists of the private stores (ff 119-122) and official stores (ff 109-112) for staff of Imperial and International Communications Limited, based at telegraph stations in Bushire, Henjam [Jazīreh-ye Hengām], Jask, and Charbar [Chabahar].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Office supplies</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jask</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Charbar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food supply</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indo-European Telegraph Line</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral agreements</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food shortages</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
