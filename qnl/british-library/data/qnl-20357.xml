U» t ^ Section 1. fc-- . V- :gnS'i [E 4808/79/23] No. 1. . —' . Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.— (Received July 23.) (No. 226.) Sir, • Jedda, July 10, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 209 of the 3rd July, I have the honour to record a few further matters of minor interest connected with the Saudi- Yemen settlement. 2. In paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference, I mentioned the probability of the Idrisis being interned comfortably at Riyadh. This was the forecast of Fuad Bey Hamza, but the JJmm-al-Qura of the 6th July announced that Ibn Saud had received Seyyid Hasan and Abdul Aziz-al-Idrisi on the 1st July and given them permission to choose their own place of residence. They elected to remain in Mecca, and the King gave orders that a palace near the Great Mosque should be prepared for them. The same paper stated that Seyyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi had arrived at Jizan en route for Mecca. 3. The Amir Feisal, who, as you know, left Hudeida by land on the 5th July, is understood to be making a short stay at Jizan in order to organise the Administration there. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who came by sea on the steamship El Nasr of the new Arab Steam Navigation Company, arrived in Jedda yesterday. He was accorded an official reception, the almost triumphal character of which was in strong contrast with the lack of attention shown to Fuad Bey Hamza when he left Jedda two days earlier. No particular honours were shown to the main body of troops, who came back by sea on the steamship A lavi of the Turner, Morrison Line on the 6th July. They were doubtless to receive their meed of praise and presents of rice and rials at Mecca or Taif. I understand that a fair amount of largesse has been bestowed on the troops who have already reached Taif. 4. The Umm-al-Qura of the 6th July also published telegrams exchanged on the 1st July between the King and the King of Iraq. King Ghazi hailed the recent settlement as a good omen and a step towards brotherliness and unity between Arab countries, and invoked a blessing on Ibn Saud's efforts to promote the welfare of the Arab nation. The Saudi King, a little more prolix, said that the brotherhood established by the treaty was what he had striven for. He had sought to promote the union of Moslems in general and Arabs in particular. He relied on God and trusted that in King Ghazi, all Arab leaders and he himself would co-operate to preserve their prestige, the safety of their countries and the honour of the Arab nation. 5. I have heard fantastic stories from Taif of the intimacy established between Ibn Saud and the Imam's envoy, Abdullah-al-Wazir, whom some of the gossips regard as a possible postulant for the throne of the Yemen. These stories deserve little attention, but it is worth mentioning that the liberation of Jerusalem has been spoken of as a possible object of common policy to be pursued by the reunited Arabs. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome and His Majesty's Chief Commissioner, Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

(IS^H^EN j 'kj ; i [E 5401/22/91] No. 1. Colonial Office to Foreign Office.—{Received August 24.) Sir, Colonial Office, August 23, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the letter from this Department of the 23rd March enclosing a copy of a report by the Resident at Aden on his mission to Sanaa for the purpose of concluding a treaty with the King of the Yemen. 2. As a result of correspondence with your Department and the Resident at Aden, it has been decided that the last sentence of the note on the Anglo- Yemeni boundary, which forms the last annexure to the Resident's report, should be deleted and the following sentence substituted :— ' Beyond this point the boundary, as laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914, respecting the boundaries of Aden and of Ottoman territory in Southern Arabia, is a line running north-eastwards into the Ruba-al-Khali (' the Empty Quarter ') at an angle of 45 degrees.' 3. The note on the Anglo-Yemeni boundary as now settled, therefore, reads as follows :— ' Article 3 of the treaty stabilises, pending a final decision, the actual frontier existing on the 11th February, 1934, the date of the signature of the treaty. This is as follows :— ' From approximately Husn Murad to the Wadi Bana it is identical with the old demarcated Anglo-Turkish boundary as shown on official maps of the Aden Protectorate. From the demarcated point on the Wadi Bana, eastwards, it follows tribal boundaries which have never been demarcated in detail on the ground, and which the inaccuracy of existing maps makes it impossible to define precisely on paper, but which are known to the tribes concerned. These are the northern and eastern boundary of the Upper Yafa tribe, excluding Rubeiatein, the boundaries between the Upper Yafa, Lower Yafa and Fadhli tribes and Beidha, the north-western and northern boundary of the Audhali tribe, the western boundary of the Aulaqi tribe, and the western and north-western boundary of Beihan, including the Masabi country. Beyond this point the boundary, as laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914, respecting the boundaries of Aden and of Ottoman territory in Southern Arabia, is a line running north-eastwards into the Ruba-al-Kliali (' the Empty Quarter ? ) at an angle of 45 degrees.'

[E 5194/79/25] Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 13.) (No. 240.) Sir, Jedda, July 30, 1934. WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 202 of the 27th June, I have the honour to forward herewith a complete translation of the Treaty of Taif, which has been prepared by Mr. Furlonge. 2. Further study has served little to elucidate the obscurities of article 4 of this document. These arise partly from the absence of any trustworthy and sufficiently detailed map of the area, but more especially from the rather confusing use of the same word to denote the name of a tribe and at the same time to describe its tribal grazing-ground or dira. These latter are, moreover, known accurately probably only to the tribes owning them and to neighbouring tribes, who may or may not be in entire agreement as to their boundaries. Until the terrain through which this frontier runs is accurately mapped and surveyed, article 4 will, it is believed, continue to be a somewhat unintelligible concatenation of place and tribal names. 3. Otherwise, no points of importance, other than those noted by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch under reference, have emerged except that article 4 does provide for a ' friendly and brotherly ' delimitation of the frontier. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad, and His Majesty's High Commissioner for Egypt, Ramleh.

Treaty of Islamic Friendship and Brotherhood, between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Kinqdom of the Yemen. ^ ini i Hit V ' HIS Honourable Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz Abdurrahman-al-Feysal-al- Saud. King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, on the one part, and His Honourable Majesty the Imam Yahya-bin-Muhammad Hamiduddin, King of the Yemen, on the other part: Being desirous of ending the state of war unfortunately existing between them and their Governments and peoples; And of uniting the Islamic Arab nation and raising its condition and maintaining its prestige and independence ; And in view of the necessity of establishing firm treaty relations between them and their Governments and countries on a basis of mutual advantage and reciprocal interest; And wishing to fix the frontiers between their countries and to establish relations of ' Bon-Voisinage' and ties of Islamic friendship between them and to strengthen the foundations of peace and tranquillity between their countries and peoples; And being desirous that there should be a united front against sudden mishaps and a solid structure to preserve the safety of the Arab Peninsula, [181 n—1] b2 Have resolved to conclude a treaty of Islamic friendship and Arab brotherhood between them and for that purpose have nominated the following representatives plenipotentiaries on their behalf :— On behalf of His Honourable Majesty the King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, His Royal Highness the Amir Khalid Abdul Aziz, son of His Majesty and Acting President of the Council of Ministers, And on behalf of His Honourable Majesty the King of the Yemen, his Excellency Sayyed Abdul-bin-Ahmed-al-Wazir. Their Majesties the two Kings have accorded to their above-mentioned representatives full powers and absolute authority; and their above-mentioned representatives, having perused each other s credentials and found them in proper form, have, in the name of their Kings, agreed upon the following articles :— Article 1. The state of war existing between the Kingdom of the Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia shall be terminated as from the moment of signature of this treaty, and there shall forthwith be established between their Majesties the Kings and their countries and peoples a state of perpetual peace, firm friend ship, and everlasting Islamic Arab brotherhood, inviolable in whole or in part. The two high contracting parties undertake to settle in a spirit of affection and friendship all disputes and differences which may arise between them, and to ensure that a spirit of Islamic Arab brotherhood shall dominate their relations in all states and conditions. They call God to witness the goodness of their intentions and their true desire for concord and agreement, both secretly and openly, and they pray the Almighty to grant them and their successors and heirs and Governments success in the continuance of this proper attitude, which is pleasing to the Creator and honourable to their race and religion. Article 2. Each of the two high contracting parties recognises the full and absolute independence of the kingdom of the other party and his sovereignty over it. His Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman-al-Feysal-al-Saud, King of the baudi Arab Kingdom, admits to His Majesty the Imam Yahya and his lawful descendants the full and absolute independence of the Kingdom of the Yemen and his sovereignty over it, and His Majesty the Imam Yahya-bin-Muhammad Hamiduddin, King of the Yemen, admits to His Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz and his lawful descendants the full and absolute independence of the Saudi Arab Kingdom and his sovereignty over it. Each of them gives up any right he claimed over any part or parts of the country of the other party beyond the frontiers fixed and defined in the text of this treaty. His Majesty the Imam King Abdul Aziz abandons by this treaty any right of protection or occupation, or any other right, which he claimed in the country, which, according to this treaty, belongs to the Yemen and which was (formerly) in the possession of the Idrisis and others. His Majesty the Imam Yahya similarly abandons by this treaty any right he claimed m the name of Yemeni unity or otherwise, in the country ' (formerly) in the possession of the Idrisis or the A1 Aidh, or in Najran, or in the Yam country, which according to this treaty belongs to the Saudi Arab Kingdom Article 3. The two high contracting parties agree to conduct their relations and communications m such a manner as will secure the interests of both parties and will cause no harm to either of them, provided that neither of the high Pa \T fl ] ,T n ? e t0 the ot 1 he ^ P art y less than he concedes to a third party Neither of the two parties shall be bound to concede to the other party more than he receives m return. Article 4. The frontier line which divides the countries of the two high contracting parties is explained m sufficient detail hereunder. This line is considered as a fixed dividing boundary between the territories subject to eachI m The frontier line between the two kingdoms begins at a point half way between Medi and A1 Musim on the coast of the Red Sea, and (runs) up to the mountains of the Tihama in an easterly direction. It then turns northwards until it ends on the north-west boundary between the Beni Jama'a and (the tribes) adjacent to them on the north and west. It then bends east until it ends at a point between the limits of Naqa'a and Wa'ar, which belong to the Waila tribe, and the limits of the Yam. It then bends until it reaches the pass of Marwan and Aqaba Eifada. It then bends eastwards until it ends, on the east, on the edge of the boundary between those of the Hamdan-bin-Zaid, Waila, &amp;c., who are outside Yam, and Yam. Everything on the right hand side of the above-mentioned line, which runs from the point mentioned on the sea shore up to the end of the borders on all sides of the mountains mentioned, shall belong to the Yemen, and everything on the left of the above-mentioned line shall belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. On the Yemen side are Medi, Haradh, part of the Harth tribe, Mir, the Dhahir Mountains, Shada, Dhay'a, part of the Abadil, all the country and the mountains of Razih, Manbah, with Arwa-al-Amshaykk, all the country and the mountains of Beni Jama'a, Sahar-ash-Sham, Yabad and its neighbourhood, the Maraisagha area of the Sahar-ash-Sham, the whole of Sahar, Naqa'a, Wa'ar, the whole of Waila, and also Far with Aqabat Nahuqa, the whole of Hamdam- bin-Zaid, which is outside Yam and Wad'a Dhahran. These mentioned, and their territories within their known limits, and all between the said directions and their vicinities, the names of which are not mentioned and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Yemeni Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the Yemeni side and belong to the Yemen. On the left hand side are Musam, Wa'lan, most of the Harth, the Khuba, the Jabri, most of the Abadil, all Faifa, Beni Malik, Beni Haris, the A1 Talid, Qahtan, Dhahran, Wadi'a, all the Wadi'a Dhahran, together with the pass of Marwan, and Aqaba Rifada, and the area lying beyond on the east and north of Yam and Najran, Hadhim, Zur Wada, all the Waila in Najran, and all below Aqaba Nuhuqa, up to the edges of Najran and Yam on the east, all these, and their territories within their known limits, and all between the named directions and their vicinities which have not been mentioned by name, and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Saudi Arab Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the left of the said line and belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Everything mentioned regarding Yam, Najran, Hadan, Zur Wad'a, and all the Waila in Najran, is in accordance with the decision (Tahkim) of His Majesty the Imam Yahya to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as regards Yam, and the judgment (Hukm) of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz that all of it should belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom; and while the Hadan and Zur Wad'a and the Waila in Najran belong to Waila, and, except in so far as has been mentioned, do not come within the Saudi Arab Kingdom, this shall not prevent them nor their brothers of Waila from enjoying mutual relations and intercourse and the usual and customary co-operation. This line then extends from the end of the above-mentioned limits between the edges of the Saudi Arab tribes and of those of the Hamdam-bin-Zaid, and all the Yemeni tribes who are outside Yam. All the borders and the Yemeni territories up to the end of the Yemeni frontier in all directions belong to the Yemeni Kingdom; and all the borders and territories up to the end of their boundaries, in all directions, belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. All points mentioned in this article, whether north, south, east or west, are to be considered in accordance with the general trend of the frontier line in the directions indicated; often obstacles cause it to bend into the country of one or other kingdom. As regards the determination and fixing of the said line, the separating out of the tribes and the settlement of their diras in the best manner, these shall be effected by a committee formed of an equal number of persons from the two parties, in a friendly and brotherly way and without prejudice, according to tribal usage and custom. Article 5. In view of the desire of both high contracting parties for the continuance of peace and tranquillity, and for the non-existence of anything which might disturb the thoughts of these two countries, they mutually undertake not to construct any fortified building within a distance of 5 kilom. on either side of the frontier, anywhere along the frontier line. [181 n— 1] b 2■i Article 6. The two high contracting parties undertake immediately to withdraw their troops from the country which, by virtue of this treaty, becomes the possession of the other party, and to safeguard the inhabitants and troops. Article 7. The two high contracting parties each undertake to prevent their people from committing any harmful or hostile act against the people of the other kingdom, in any district or on any route; to prevent raiding between the Bedouin on both sides; to return all (property) which is established by legal investigation, after the ratification of this treaty, as having been taken; to give compensation for all damage, according as may be legally necessary, where crimes of murder or wounding have been committed; and severely to punish anyone proved to have committed any hostile act. This article shall continue operative until another agreement shall have been drawn up between the two parties as to the manner of investigating and estimating damage and loss. Article 8. The two high contracting parties mutually undertake to refrain from resorting to force in all difficulties between them, and to do their utmost to settle any disputes which may arise between them, whether caused by this treaty or the interpretation of all or any of its articles or resulting from any other cause, by friendly representations; in the event of inability to agree by this means each of the two parties undertakes to resort to arbitration, of which the conditions, the manner of demand, and the conduct are explained in the appendix attached to this treaty. This appendix shall have the force and authority of this treaty, and shall be considered as an integral part of it. Article 9. J he two high contracting parties undertake, by all moral and material means at their command, to prevent the use of their territory as a base and centre for any hostile action or enterprise, or preparations therefor, against the country of the other party. T hey also undertake to take the following measures immediately on receipt of a written demand from the Government of the other party :— (1) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of the Government which receives the application to take measures, he should, after the matter has been legally investigated and established, receive a deterrent punishment which will put an end to his actions and prevent their recurrence. (2) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of the Government making the demand for measures to be taken, he should be immediately arrested by the Government applied to and handed over to the Government making the demand. The Government asked to surrender him shall have no right to excuse themselves from carrying out this demand, but shall be bound to take adequate steps to prevent the flight of the person asked for, and in the event of the person asked for being able to run a^ay, the Government from whose territory he has fled shall undertake not to allow him to return to its territory, and if he is able so to return, shall arrest him and hand him over to his Government. (3) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of a third Government, the Government to whom the demand is made and who finds the person in its territories, shall immediately and directly after the receipt of the demand of the other Government, take steps to expel him from its country, and to consider him as undesirable and to prevent him from returning there in future. Article 10. The two high contracting parties agree not to receive anyone who has fled .rom the jurisdiction of his Government, whether he be great or small, official or non-official, an individual or a group. Each of the high contracting parties shall^ateeri / ..X take adequate and effective administrative or military measures, &amp;c,, to prevent these fugitives entering within the borders of its country. If one or all of them succeeds in crossing the frontier and entering its territory, it shall be bound to disarm the refugee and to arrest him and hand him over to the Government of of the country from which he fled. In the event of its being unable to arrest him, it shall take adequate steps to drive him out from the country which he has entered into the country to which he belongs. Article 11. The two high contracting parties undertake to prevent their Amirs, Amils and officials from interfering in any way whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, with the subjects of the other party. They undertake to take full measures to prevent the occurrence of any disturbance or misunderstanding as a result of such actions. Article 12. Each of the two high contracting parties recognises that the people of all areas accruing to the other party by virtue of this treaty are subjects of that party. Each of them undertakes not to accept as its subjects any person or persons who are subjects of the other party except with the consent of that party. The subjects of each of the two parties, when in the country of the other party, should be treated in accordance with local law. Article 13. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to announce a full and complete amnesty for all crimes and hostile acts which may have been committed by any person or persons who are subjects of the other party, but reside in its territory {i.e., in the territory of the party issuing the amnesty). Similarly, each of them undertakes to issue a full, general and complete amnesty to those of its subjects who may have gone, or taken refuge, or in any manner joined themselves, to the other party; for all crimes; and for the property which they may have taken from the time when they came to the other party until their return, whatever its nature and whatever its amount; and not to allow any sort of injury, punishment or constraint to be made upon them on account of their having taken refuge or joined themselves, or of the manner in which they did so. If either party has any doubt of the occurrence of anything contrary to this undertaking, the party entertaining the doubt may apply to the other party to convoke a meeting of the representatives who signed this treaty; if it is impossible for any one of them to attend, he may depute another fully authorised and empowered person, well acquainted with the localities and who is anxious to effect a settle ment between the parties and to carry out the rights of both, to attend to investigate the matter, so that no injustice or dispute may arise. The decision of these representatives shall be considered as binding. Article 14. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to return the property of those of its subjects whom it pardons, and to hand it over to them or their heirs on their return to their country, in obedience to the law of their country. The high contracting parties similarly undertake not to retain any of the goods and chattels which belong to the subjects of the other party, and not to create obstacles to their free use or to the disposal of them. Article 15.

(2) To co-operate mentally and morally as far as possible. (3) To undertake negotiations with the other party to discover the best way of guaranteeing the safety of the country of that party and of preventing its being harmed, and to refrain from any act which might be interpreted as assisting that external aggressor.

Arbitration Covenant between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Yemen. Whereas their Majesties the Imams King Abdul Aziz, King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and King Yahya, King of the Yemen, have agreed in accordance with article 8 of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Good Understanding, known as the Treaty of Taif, signed on the 6th Safar, 1353, to refer to arbitration any dispute or difference which may arise out of the relations between them, their Governments and countries, when all friendly representations fail to settle it, the two high contracting parties undertake to effect arbitration in the manner shown in the following articles :— Article 1. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to accept reference of the question in dispute to arbitration within one month of the date of receipt of the other party of a demand for arbitration. Article 2. The arbitration shall be undertaken by a committee composed of an equal number of arbitrators, half of whom shall be selected by each of the two parties. A chief arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement between the two high contracting parties. If they do not agree in this respect, each of them shall nominate a person, and if either party accepts the person nominated by the other party, the person in question shall become chief arbitrator. If even this cannot be agreed upon, the chief arbitrator shall be chosen by ballot, on the understanding that the ballot shall only be drawn on persons acceptable to both parties. The person chosen by ballot shall become the head of the arbitration committee, and entitled to settle the case. If, however, agreement cannot be arrived at on the persons acceptable to both parties, negotiations shall be carried on until the two parties agree on this point.8 Article 3. The selection of the arbitration committee and its chief shall be completed within one month of the date of the end of the month fixed for the reply of the party whose acceptance of arbitration was requested by the other party. The arbitration committee shall meet at a place to be agreed upon within a period not exceeding one month after the expiry of the two months provided for at the beginning of this article. The arbitration committee shall give its award within a period which, in any case, should not exceed one month as from the expiry of the period fixed for the meeting to take place. The award of the arbitration committee shall be given by a majority of votes, and shall be considered binding on the two parties. Its execution immediately after its issue and communication shall be considered obligatory. Each of the two high contracting parties may appoint a person or persons, as he desires, to defend his case before the arbitration committee and to produce the necessary evidence and arguments. Article 4. The charges in regard to the arbitrators of each party shall be chargeable to their respective parties. The charges of the chief arbitrator shall be chargeable to both parties equally, as well as the expenses of the other investigations. Article 5. This covenant shall be regarded as an integral part of the Treaty of Taif signed this day, the 6th Safar, 1353, and will remain in force during the period of the validity of the treaty. Written in Arabic, in two copies, of which each of the two high contracting parties is in possession of one. Signed on the sixth day of Safar, thirteen hundred and fifty-three.

The necessary measures have been taken to hand over Seyyid Hasan and Seyyid Abdul Aziz-bin-Muhammad A1 Idrisi, who will be handed over immediately to His Highness the Amir Eeysal in the Tihama, but as Sayyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi is still in the Abadil country, the necessary steps have been taken to bring him down from there, so that we can surrender him.

(b) If the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz desire to arrest him in their territories where he is, the Government of His Majesty the Imam Yahya will, on their part, concert every kind of military restriction in their power in order to prevent him from fleeing into their territories, and undertake to arrest him, together with any person from any district or tribe in the Saudi Arab Kingdom who may have joined him in his activities, and to surrender them unconditionally to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, in the event of their entering the districts of the Yemeni Kingdom, and to prevent him and any persons who may have joined him in his activities from escaping abroad in the event of their entering the territories of the Kingdom of the Yemen. (2) Those Sharifs and Others who were in any connected with the Idrisis and their activities. If these should desire to join the Idrisis, they shall be granted the safety, protection, respect, and regard due to their position, by the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. If, however, they should not so desire, they shall be expelled from the country of the Imam Yahya and shall not be allowed to remain in it, and, in the event of their returning to it a second time, shall be at once expelled and warned that if they return again they will be handed over to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. If they should return again after their expulsion, I undertake in the name of His Majesty the Imam Yahya to surrender them unconditionally to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz.10 I request that your Highness will be good enough to regard this as a firm undertaking having the same value as the treaty concluded this day between us and your Highness, may God be witness of it; I request that this may be considered as confirming the verbal agreement reached between us in this matter.

THE situation with regard to the development of motor transport services in this country has been somewhat obscure of recent months. That the Saudi Government have been actively considering not merely the establishment, in collaboration with the authorities in Iraq, of an overland motor service for pilgrims from Iraq to Medina, but a more extensive service, based on Mecca and Riyadh, seemed evident. 2. In May last, Muhammad Sadiq, the King's chauffeur (No. 83 of Jedda Personalities Report), a man of considerable business ability and a capitalist to boot, informed the Indian vice-consul that he had received from the hands of Ibn Sand, whose high favour he enjoys, a concession for a motor transport service between Mecca, Riyadh and Hasa, Riyadh and Iraq, and Medina and Iraq for a period of ten years. In August he was of the opinion that his concession still held good. 3. Meanwhile, in July, the Iraq Charge d'Affaires here was stating confidently to intimates that the question of the overland motor route for pilgrims between Iraq and Medina had been settled by the two Governments concerned. 4. I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of an announcement which appeared in the Umm-al-Qura of the 24th August, relative to the transport of mails by car in this country, and also to the transport of pilgrims from the Persian Gulf ' and neighbouring frontiers ' to the Holy Cities. This disposes of Sadiq's concession unless it was not exclusive and monopolistic, but the short period of notice allowed to tenderers for the submission of their applications should enable the King's chauffeur to seize this opportunity. The communique would also appear to mark a further stage in the development of the overland motor route for pilgrims between Medina and Iraq. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department, and His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura, No. 506 of August 24, 1934. (Translation.) Official Communique No. 18. THE Government announce that they have a project in hand for the transportation of mail by cars from Mecca to Riyadh and thence to Hasa and also from Mecca to Qasim, Hail and Jauf. They are also prepared to grant a concession for the transportation of pilgrims from the Persian Gulf to Mecca and also from the neighbouring frontiers to Mecca or Medina. Whoever is capable of undertaking this task should approach the Government with his terms, on the understanding that mail to Riyadh and Hasa should be twice a month; and to Jauf once a month. Fifteen days' notice from this date is allowed to those who wish to undertake this enterprise. [206 aa—5] aP.Z.6230. Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering Letter,Dated 5tli Oct. 1934, No.E.5981/79/25.

Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there to stabilise the situation. My Indian vice-consul has just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that recruiting is being unobtrusively carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts. That there was trouble, of an undefined nature, in respect of three tribes in the north, whose names, however, were not specified, I gathered a few days ago indirectly from a subordinate in the Governorate here. 3. These reports lend interesting corroboration to the information which has recently been appearing in the Royal Air Force Monthly Intelligence Summaries for Palestine and Transjordan, of which the most recent example is contained in paragraph 261 of the summary for August 1934. 4.

Conversation between our Special Correspondent and Fuad Bey Hamza. Q. WILL your Excellency tell me in detail what was the aim in present circumstances of your visit to the European capitals? A. I went to Europe on a private visit to take a rest, but I also took the opportunity of meeting the men of Italy, Franee and Great Britain, of discussing with them questions of interest to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and of solving some of the outstanding problems. I visited Italy and met Signor Mussolini. This visit served to confirm the good relations existing between the Italian and Arabian Governments. I visited the French capital and met the men of its Government and spoke to that experienced politician, the late M. Barthou, whose death was a great loss to the French nation. He was an energetic man, and he wisely steered French policy in the stormy sea of politics. I visited the English capital and met the Hon. Sir John Simon, the Foreign Minister, and other men of the British Government. I am glad to be able to declare that we succeeded in overcoming many difficulties and in coming to an understanding about many questions which are of interest to the Arab Saudi and the British Governments. Q. Hejaz being one of the Governments that inaugurated the League of Nations, is it the intention of His Majesty to use that right, having neglected so far to claim it ? A. Hejaz, which was one of the Governments which founded the League of Nations, was then an independent country by itself. Now it is not. Q. But the Government of His Majesty Abdul Aziz has inherited the Hejaz Kingdom! A. If we had inherited that, we should have inherited 'also some other things which are not in our interest. So is it better not to have inherited anything. Q. Then is it not the intention of the Government of His Majesty to enter the League of Nations ? A. It is possible that this question is now under discussion. Q. What about the negotiations concerning the Hejaz Railway ? A. Negotiations on that subject are taking place between the Arabian, French and English Governments. Probably a conference will be held shortly to take a final decision about this railway. Q. Is it not to the interest of Hejaz, Syria and the Moslem world to have the line between Maan and Medina repaired and put into action, and leave other questions to be discussed later ? A. Among other questions considered during the negotiations, which took place a long time ago, was the repairing of the line between Maan and Medina. One of the subjects to be discussed by the conference is the way for securing the necessary funds for repairing this part of the line.

Sir, ^ ^ Foreign Office, December 13, 1934. SINCE my conversation with you on the 25th October, I have considered further the suggestion that His Majesty's Government might agree to abandon the right of manumission at present exercised by His Majesty's Minister at Jedda in return for the adoption by the Saudi Government of effective measures against slavery. 2. You will recall that, in the course of the conversation with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs which took place at the Foreign Office on the 20th September, and in which you yourself took part, Fuad Bey Hamza suggested that King Ibn Saud might be persuaded to take action with a view to limiting the future importation of slaves into Saudi Arabia and with a view to alleviating the lot of such slaves as already existed in that country, provided that such action were made to appear spontaneous and could not be represented as having been extorted from him by foreign pressure. Fuad Bey added, however, that King Ibn Saud would require in advance some guarantee that, if he were to take action in this sense, His Majesty's Government would be prepared in return to abandon their present right of manumission. A copy of the record of this conversation, which was the second of those held in London, was enclosed in my despatch No. 353 of the 3rd October to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda. 3. There are, in principle, grave objections to any action which may be construed as in any way a relaxation of the warfare which His Majesty's Govern ment have consistently waged against the institution of slavery or as a surrender of any weapon which they are at present able to use in their attacks on that institution. At the same time, I have been impressed by the evidence adduced in your memorandum^ 1 ) written at the Foreign Office on the 23rd October, 1934, a copy of which is enclosed for reference, to show that the right of manumission at present enjoyed in Saudi Arabia by His Majesty's Government depends, in fact, for its effective exercise upon the goodwill of the Saudi Government, and must consequently be regarded, not only as a precarious, but even as a wasting, asset. In view of that evidence, I am disposed at least to examine the possibility of some arrangement on the lines suggested by Fuad Bey. Before, however, I can reach any final decision as to the advisability of such an arrangement, I shall need to be more fully informed regarding the exact nature of the legislation which King Ibn Saud would propose to introduce in this connexion, and the probable degree of effectiveness with which it would be carried out. 4. In principle, if properly framed and carried out, both of the measures suggested by Fuad Bey in London might be acceptable, provided that their execution could be properly guaranteed. With regard to the first of these, namely, the prohibition of the further importation of slaves into Saudi Arabia, Sir George Maxwell, with whom I have also discussed this matter, has suggested that possibly the Saudi Government might be urged to adhere to clause (a) of article 2 of the International Slavery Convention of 1926. The relevant section of that article runs as follows :— ' The high contracting parties undertake, each in respect of the terri tories placed under its sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection, suzerainty or tutelage, so far as they have not already taken the necessary steps : (a) To prevent and suppress the slave trade.' 5. I shall be glad to learn whether, in your view, this suggestion, which appears to have much to recommend it, would be practicable. If, for some reason, ( l ) Not printed. [281 n—11 December 13, 1934. v ' Section 1. No. 1.-i Kiiig Ibn Saud would, in your opinion, be likely to object to the idea of acceding to any pait of an international convention on this subject, but might still be willing to take the desired action, do you consider that action to this end might equally effectively be embodied in exchange of notes between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government in some such terms as those of the exchange of notes which took place between the Resident at Aden and the Imam of the Yemen on the conclusion of the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Co-operation in February of the present year ? Copies of the texts(') of these notes are enclosed in this despatch for convenience of reference. 6. Further, 1 consider that, before consenting to any arrangement on the lines proposed by Fuad Bey, His Majesty's Government would be entitled to satisfy themselves that any proclamation or legislation issued or commanded by him against the importation of slaves into his dominions would be capable of effective enforcement. His Majesty's Government would wish, for example, to be fully informed in advance what machinery would be provided for the execution of any decree or legislation in this matter; what punishment would be inflicted for the infringement of the law; whether slaves imported in violation of the law would be entitled to freedom; and whether, if this were so. King Ibn Saud would guarantee to give them such freedom. The same necessity for precise information m advance as to the details of the action to be taken would also apply in the case of the second measure suggested by Fuad Bey, namely, action taken to alleviate the present conditions of slavery in Saudi Arabia. 7. Subject to these conditions, I am prepared to consider any proposals which the Saudi Government may wish to put forward, and you are authorised to discuss the question with them on these lines in whatever manner you may consider most appropriate. 1 should, however, make it clear that I am definitely opposed to the abandonment by His Majesty's Government of their existing right of manumission unless the Saudi Government can offer adequate compensation, that is to say, unless they can make proposals, on the effective execution of which His Majesty s Government can rely, and which would be at least as satisfactory as the present system in securing the actual reduction of slavery. For this reason I am not disposed to consider any proposal for less effective, or less compiehensive, action than that already outlined by tuad Bey. I observe in this connexion that it was provisionally suggested to Fuad Bev during the conversation with him in London that the question of slavery might figure in any negotiations which might be undertaken between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Government with a view to a general settlement of major questions outstanding between them. While I have no objection to vour using the occasion of such negotiations to discuss the question of slavery, if these negotiations are, in fact, approved by His Majesty's Government and take place, and U you consider that the subject can be most advantageously dealt with in this manner, I am not willing that this question should be treated as part of the geaeiai piocess of compensation and adjustment which such negotiations if they ta. e place will doubtless entail. That is to say, the right of manumission, which His Majesty s Government at present enjoy, should not be regarded as an asset which may be traded against some countervailing advantage in another sphere. but can only be abandoned m return for some action by the Saudi Government w ich is specifically directed towards the effective limitation or abolition of sJaverv.

Sir, ^ Jedda, November 27, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 360 of the 12th December, 1933, relative to the visit to this country by air of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission headed by Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, I have the honour to inform you that on the 22nd November a similar mission arrived from Egypt by aeroplane, almost a year since the first visit was made. The members of the mission this year are Midhat Yeghen Pasha, chairman of directors of the Banque Misr; Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, deputy chairman of directors of the Banque Misr and Egyptian Senator; Fuad Bey Sultan and Ismail Bey Jad Barakat, members of the board of directors of Banque Misr; Kemal Bey Aloui, manager of Misr Airwork, S.A.E.; and Muhammad-al-Masiri Bey, manager of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company. The party, which is considerably stronger in its composition than that of last year, arrived towards sunset in two aeroplanes, and were officially welcomed on arrival by the Amir of Jedda, who was accompanied by local officials, and notables and members of the Egyptian consulate. 2. I understand that the two aeroplanes, a De Havilland Dragon (as last year) and a Tiger Moth, made the journey from Egypt in one day, leaving Cairo at 5 a.m ., an improvement on last year's performance, when the flight was made in two stages. Short halts were made this year at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu. The pilots are Mr. G. S. Brown (flight-lieutenant R.A.E. Reserve) and Ismail Effendi Sidky. 3. Talaat Pasha, who called on His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires the day after his arrival, left with his associates for Mecca by car on the 25th November. He is expected to leave here on the 28th November by air for Yanbu, whence he will visit Medina by car, and return to Egypt by air on the 1st December. 4. I hope to be in a position to report more fully in due course on the objects of this second visit to the Hejaz. Generally, I think, it may be assumed that the mission will interest itself, as last year, in making arrangements for the reception of Egyptian pilgrims coming to this country by the Egyptian steamers Zamzam and Nil, and in taking further steps to establish here branches of the Banque Misr. 5. The mission do not appear to be the guests of the Saudi Government this year, and whilst in Jedda have been accommodated in the new premises taken by the Banque Misr during the past year, which were originally intended, it is believed, for the Soviet Legation. Generally, it may be said that less publicity has been given to this visit than to its counterpart of last year; I have still to hear of the broadcast distribution of piece-goods, &amp;c., of Egyptian manufacture, whilst this year the aeroplanes have not been actively engaged in treating the Jedda populace to joy-rides. 6. I was informed by my Egyptian colleague, some time before the arrival of the mission, that Talaat Harb Pasha had requested permission of the Saudi authorities to be allowed to fly to Riyadh to meet the King. I understand that the Saudis have been unable to accede to this request. 7.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 18.) (No. 360.) Sir, Jedda, December 4, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 349 of the 27th November last, relative to the Egyptian commercial and financial mission to this country, I have the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, Midhat Yeghen Pasha and party (with the exception of Kemal Bey Aloui, who left the same day for Egypt by Khediyial mail steamer) left for Yanbu by air on the 28th November and after visiting Medina by car resumed their return journey to Egypt on the 1st December. 2. Talaat Pasha's visit this year is shorter than was expected and only two whole days were put in at Mecca. By some this is thought to be due to his dissatisfaction at being refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see the King. His donations to schools and hospitals were on a modest scale, according to report, but free distribution as charity of piece-goods and other Egyptian manufactures, which had not taken place when I wrote my despatch under reference, was subse quently undertaken on behalf of the Egyptian mission by the Jedda municipality on the 4th December. 3. I learn that Talaat Pasha was primarily interested in arranging with the Saudi authorities for further facilities this year for Egyptian pilgrims. The shipping agents will continue to be Messrs. Tlaji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., according to their own account, and financial arrangements, which are said to include the perception of Saudi pilgrim dues from the individual pilgrims by Banque Misr and payment to the Saudi Arab Government in a lump^ sum, will be handled by Banque Misr or separately appointed agents here. Two large motor-launches, to seat 100 passengers each, are to be brought here by Banque Misr in order to facilitate the transport of pilgrims from the outer anchorage in the heavy seas. The present charges for sambuqs are to remain undisturbed, and the local interests involved are not to suffer. Indeed, it appears that Talaat Pasha has been at pains to assure local merchants and shippers that his objects are not to deprive them of the benefits they now enjoy from the pilgrimage, but to ensure greater comfort for Egyptian pilgrims, and increase their numbers, which this year he estimates at about 8,000. Pilgrims of the wealthier sort are to be accommodated in the new premises, in both Jedda and Mecca, now partly occupied by the offices of Banque Misr. 4. It is stated with some confidence by Mr. Philby that the Saudi Govern ment have obtained from Talaat Pasha a loan, probably small and probably in the nature of an advance on account of pilgrims' dues, which will be paid by Egyptian pilgrims coming on Haj. 7 7 n • . ^ x- 13 5. Two small steamers, the Mariut and Manzaleh, flying the Egyptian nag, have called at Jedda during the past few days from Suez and have proceeded to Port Sudan They have carried small quantities of cargo, and are statea by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., who have been appointed agents by Talaat Pasha, to be testing the possibilities of a more regular service. 6. The transport of pilgrims by air was not pursued, m view ot the quarantine and other difficulties in the way. Ihe Saudi authorities were not verv ready to discuss the question of air development with members of the mission, as I have already reported in my despatch No. 351 of the 30th November. The question of a concession for the construction of a railway between Mecca and Jedda is said to have been touched on, but quite tentatively and without further more serious consideration. 1 ^ • i o ^ 7.

In Chapter I of the Report- for December reference was made to the presence of various high personages at Mecca and the dissension and muddle thought to exist there. It now begins to emerge that various important matters of internal policy have been under consideration and some of the results are gradually coming to light, 2, One of these results has been the public ation in the l T mm'Al-Qura of January 25th of a decree regarding the readmission of emigre s ? a translation of which I enclose. On the face of it it is a document of considerable importance. Closer examination suggests a good deal of doubt as to its real scope and the doubt is the more difficult to re solve 9 as the unofficial comments in the Umm-al~Qura are merely laudatory and ? if one can speak of such a thing as public opinion^ its attitude towards such announcements is apt to be one of sceptical inertia. 3. The heading of the decree describes it as a general pardon or amnesty and the word pardon recurs in Article 2 but A.rticle 1 contains nothing /in e Right honourable s Sir John Simon, . C.S.I. , K.C.V.O. etc,p etc. 9 etc.in the nature of an amnesty for political offences nor does it indicate the conditions to 'be imposed 0 ' 1 - taking advantage of it.

Such persons will doubtless be expected to give assurances of their submission to the present regime and of their acceptance of Saudi nationality, 4. It is much more doubtful whether the decree amounts to an assured amnesty for persons, of the Dabbagh type 9 who have conspired against Ibn Saud ? or for tribal personages who have been concerned in past revolts, 5, I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department; His Excellency the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan; His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad; the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire; Mis Majesty's Chie f Commis sioner at Aden; His [aj e sty's High Commissioner for Egypt and His Excellency the Governor General of the Sudan at Khartoum, I have the honour to be with the highest respect ?

The first relates to enlistment in the ranks and contains the conditions and terms of service, whilst the second announces the establish ment, as from the 16th January, 1935, of a military school at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to pursue a three years' course of training. 2. This evidence of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's determination to strengthen and improve the present standing army of Saudi Arabia is of considerable interest. The development may be the fruit of experience gained during the war with the Yemen, though I am unable to believe that the Saudi regular forces are to be largely increased. The tribes, and notably the Ikhwan. will always be Ibn Saud's most effective and least expensive military weapon. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Roger Maigret, who, as you are aware, is Charge d'Affaires en titre of the French consulate here, informed me in the course of conversation yesterday that his Government now proposed to raise their mission in Saudi Arabia to the status of a Legation. Budgetary provision had been made, and he expected the change to date from the 1st January next. He stated, in answer to my enquiry, that the head of the post would hold the rank of Minister, and that he would remain on in that capacity. On my congratulating him, he explained that although he understood privately that his appointment had been contemplated by his Ministry in any case, yet Fuad Bey Hamza had interested himself with the French Government to secure his selection. The elevation of the French representation here, and the appointment of M. Maigret, may well have been, although the latter did not say so, amongst the questions discussed with the French Government by Fuad Bey Hamza during his recent visit to Europe. 2. M. Maigret, who, as is his wont, has remained virtually invisible during the summer, is again becoming locomotive, as he proposes to leave Jedda within a few days for a three weeks' visit to the Yemen. Upon his return from Sana, he hopes, before the Haj, to pay a brief visit to Syria to meet the High Commissioner there. 3.

(No. m.) ^ Jedda, December 10, 1934. .RELATIONS between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, since the recent dispute, have to all appearances pursued an uneventful course and have ceased to occupy the forefront of public attention locally. Nevertheless reports, vague but persistent, have not been wanting that all is still not well in the Yemen. Frontier difficulties are hinted at, and perhaps somewhat exaggerated stories are current of the restiveness of the Seif-ul-Islam Ahmad, said to be under arms still at Sada and chafing under the restrictions imposed by his father the Imam. 2. I have been disposed to attach little importance to these rumours, and it is perhaps unnecessary to treat them seriously. My French colleague, M. Maigret, spoke to me yesterday, however, on this subject, and whilst admitting that his own information was indefinite, expressed the opinion that there undoubtedly did exist trouble it was, at present, difficult to diagnose. He hoped to leave Jedda shortly on a three weeks' visit to Sana, and expected to be able to arrive at a more accurate appreciation of the situation in the Yemen during that time. 3. The unrest may be of purely internal significance, and may be a natural reaction after the Imam's ill-success in the late war Avith Saudi Arabia. The press of both countries have, however, not entirely allayed misgivings recently by protestiDg with vigour that the two countries are now on the most friendly- terms, and denying with emphasis the 'false reports ' put about by interested persons to the contrary. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November quoted an article from the Sana newspaper the Iman in which reports of the concentration of troops on the Saudi-Yemen frontier were categorically denied. Peace and tranquillity prevailed; conditions had returned to normal; and concord reigned between the ' two Moslem sects ' (presumably the Zeidi and Shafi sects of the Yemen). From the Hejazi press, the Iman continued, it was understood that a similarly fortunate situation existed in this country. The Umm-al-Qura delightedly welcomed the article with lengthy variations on the themes of Arab brotherhood, the Treaty of Taif and the wiles of unscrupulous mischief-makers inspired by hatred and jealousy of the Arabs and of Islam. I do not propose to transmit to you a translation of this article. 4. It may not be out of place here to inform you, in regard to the Saudi- Yemen treaty settlement, of the insistence with which Mr. Philby continues to express his conviction that Ibn Saud did in fact receive a war indemnity from the Imam. Fie has more than once reverted to the subject. Ibn Saud, Mr. Philby stated quite recently, has for some two or three months been paying daily to his tribal visitors at Riyadh (as I have recorded in Jedda reports for October and November last) large sums in cash and kind, which my informant estimated at an average of 40,000 Maria Theresa dollars a day, or an approximate total over the whole period of about £100,000 gold. Where has this money come from if not from the Imam ? £100,000 would probably be the amount of the indemnity, I still feel unable to share Mr. Philby's conviction, and I find that the French Charge d'Affaires, to whom Mr. Philby has spoken in a similar strain, is equally sceptical. M. Maigret considered that Ibn Saud, to content the tribes disappointed of loot in the war, has probably had to make serious inroads on the Royal Treasury, and expressed his belief, from his personal knowledge of the Imam s character, that the latter would have continued the war, by no means lost to him after the fall of Hudeida, rather than have pa.rted with so considerable a sum of money. 5.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 31.) (No. 370.) Sir, Jedda, December 11, 1934. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 351 of the 5th December, 1933, in which I ventured to submit a short review of the general financial situation in this country. I again propose to attempt, with the modest material available in a country where statistics of any value are unknown, an appreciation of the general financial and economic condition of Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. Since the despatch under reference was written, the intervening months have witnessed little real alleviation of the financial difficulties with which Ibn Saud was then finding himself increasingly confronted. The principal drain on his resources, due to the long-drawn struggle with the Yemen, the necessity of providing for an army in the field and at the same time of cementing the loyalty of tribal leaders in Nejd by subsidies and supplies in kind, can scarcely have diminished until the operations came to a successful conclusion and the troops returned to their own country during July and August. Even then demobilisation involved the grant of gratuities in rials and in kind to each individual soldier, a process which began at Taif upon the immediate return of the troops and continued at Riyadh until mid-November. Mr. Philby estimates the cost to Ibn Saud of these gratuities alone to be in the neighbourhood of £100,000 gold. Thus the whole period under review has been one of abnormal military expenditure, in prosecuting the war and, at its conclusion, in paying in hard cash a handsome insurance premium against tribal discontent at a lootless victory. u • wi. 3. It may not unnaturally be asked where are the resources upon wJiicli tne Kin 0 ' could draw so liberally. Mr. Philby is convinced that the explanation lies in the receipt of a war indemnity from the Imam of the Yemen. I a* 11 alone in considering this view difficult to accept, and incline to the beliei that the King; has found himself compelled, in order to content his returning soldier} , to make serious inroads upon the Royal Treasury, a reservoir of unknown dimensions. , i ^ t • ^ 4 That the Saudi Exchequer could have proved of much assistance can hardlv be expected, even in the resourceful hands of the Minister of Finance. Little' additional taxation, except in the almost negligible form of a stamp duty, was imposed and in spite of certain reports to the contrary, no resort was made, as far as can be ascertained, to the exaction of forced loans. 5. The revenue, which in the despatch under reference was represented as exiguous, has probably shown some improvement but not of a nature to ottset expenditure. The pilgrimage of 1934 exceeded 25,000, in comparison with 20 000 of the year before and pilgrim dues to the Government and activity m the bazaais were stimulated in proportion. The prospects for the forthcoming pi are still conjectural, but it may not he excessive optimism to^ct a slight increase again in 1935. The remarks m last year s report in r «g ar ^ t °^ e /e'?™ 1 level of poverty of latter-day pilgrims still apply, although the effoits of Talaat Harb Pasha, upon whose activities I have reported elsewhere, are directed towards inducing Egyptians of the wealthiei soit to per orm e aj. 6 Customs receipts are still one of the several unknown factors in Saudi Arabia's economic equation. One might perhaps h ^ z F d ^ has this vear been a slight improvement. The small increase in the pilgrimage and the oartial liquidatfon of old stocks of goods in the hands of local merchants Zltta^excltX Curable influence. Receipts, has been now the practice for some years by the system of drafts to which a reference was made in the despatch under reference. [281 hh—3]7. The Saudi Government's revenue has been augmented this year, it is stated, by the receipt during the early summer of £20,000 gold from the Standard Oil Company of California, a sum believed to represent the second instalment of the initial loan promised by the company under the terms of their Hasa oil concession A further loan, said to be very small, is reported to have been obtained in November from Talaat Harb Pasha, and is thought probably to be secured on Saudi pilgrim dues, which will be paid by Egyptians during the forthcoming Ilaj. Mr. Philby, at any rate, was made happy by being paid ' £2,000 or £3,000,' half in cash and half in a draft on Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha and Co., confidential agents and importers to the Saudi authorities, not in respect, I understand, of outstanding debts, but to finance the import of motor vehicles in accordance with his concession. 8. Indeed, the position of the Saudi Government in regard to both their internal and foreign obligations is as unsatisfactory as ever. Certainly no attempt has been made during the year under review to meet the long outstanding debts due to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, and Ibn Sand appears unlikely to manifest any great readiness to do so in the near future. 9. The Minister of Finance has continued to pursue a policy of rigid economy in Government expenditure, although the opinion has been heard that money/for day to day requirements of an essential nature, is not so tight as was the case a year ago. Official salaries are still seriously in arrear and for more than the first six months of the Arabic year 1353 (until the end of October) Government servants had received a bare two months' salary, and that at the ' par ' rate of 10 rials to 110 piastres miri gold (£1 gold), whereas the current rate for rials had fluctuated, between 24 and 22 rials to the gold pound. 10. Saudi currency during the year has remained relatively steady and did not show any marked tendency to depreciate after the last pilgrimage, as I anticipated in my despatch under reference. The rial rate varied within the limits indicated above, and at the time of writing is 22, betraying again the customary appreciation which marks the arrival of pilgrims from abroad. 11. The general tone of trade in the Hejaz is stated to be somewhat healthier, the manager of the Dutch banking concern here, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, stating that during .the past year there had been slightly more movement and much less reluctance on the part of merchants to take up bills. This applied particularly to the past six months. I am indebted to him for the following figures compiled by himself and, he insists, very tentative, of the imports and exports for the Arabic years 1351 and 1352 :— 1351. £ sterling. 2,028,000 1352. £ sterling. 1,657,850 150,685 Imports Exports Piece-goods and flour, amongst the more important commodities, showed an increase in 1352 over 1351, most others falling away in the second year. The number of different headings of commodities imported was only 108 in 1352 as compared with 149 in 1351. These figures, partial and approximate though tney may be and although they relate, except for the last part of 1352, to the years pnor to the period covered by this survey, are nevertheless of some interest. „ 12 - . y ie Future drawn in the foregoing paragraphs may indicate a far nom satisfactory condition, but it is not one of wholly unrelieved gloom.

A fghanistan. NOTHING further has been heard in Jedda of Salahuddin Khan Saljuqi, who was Afghan consul at Bombay in 1933 and was appointed consul in Jedda also, but stayed for only a short portion of the pilgrimage season. A certain Sayyid Abdul Hamid Khan, who was understood to have succeeded him in Bombay, arrived in Jedda on the 16th March, 1934, and left some weeks later. He apparently regarded himself as being consul during his stay, but the Saudi Government do not seem to have made any announcement, and he did not establish official relations with the British Legation. So far as there is any Afghan consulate in this country at all, it is run by an obscure clerk at Mecca. Egypt. Abdul Hamid Munir Effendi was appointed consul in August last m succession to Hafiz Amer, the late consul, who was transferred to a post at Baerdad while on leave. The new consul had not arrived in Jedda U P tjO ^he end of December He is described as a man of 36, who was employed as Chanceiier in the consulate at Geneva in 1923. He served subsequently as vice-consul at Lyons and at Rome, and has been since 1928 attache at the Legation m Madi id Pending his arrival, the consulate at Jedda remains in charge of a colourless but amiable vice-consul named Hasan Abou Alam. France *M. Roger Maigret holds the position of permanent Charge d Affaires but the French Government have shown unwillingness to make his post more an a consulate, despite the conclusion of a general treaty with Ibn Saud m November 1931. He is a man of perhaps 60, and has had a long career m the French Is ear East service. He was employed in Morocco for many years prior to 1921, an appears to have had only a moderate reputation there. He was subsequently consul- general in Iraq. He is intelligent and witty, has a considerable knowledge of Arab countries, and boasts in his lighter moments of an equal knowledge of the Parisian underworld, as a result of having cultivated m his conscrip days. When I first knew him he was always very ready to talk about Morocco, which we both knew, but was more reticent about affairs nearer to us, notwith^ standing professions of friendship which were sometimes almost smarmy, found him rather more communicative in 1932, but we met lare y unng my I [306 ee—3]2 short stays here, as M. Maigret seldom leaves his house, except to leave Jedda ) and eschews social intercourse almost completely. His health is poor and he was much taken up with an aged mother until her death in August 1932. He does not appear to carry much weight with Saudi officials, whom he found incon ceivably tiresome when negotiating his treaty. He is understood to have a considerable book knowledge of English, and has translated Mr. Philby's ^4 mfem into French. (Written in January 1933.) 1 Since the foregoing account was written, M. Maigret continued to lead the life of a grass-widower, consoled, it is thought, by a permanent lady guest, in Jedda. He attracted attention in 1933 by a visit to Riyadh, which had some official purpose, though he concealed it under the pretence of haying gone by invitation of the King to obtain material for a book. After his return, he continued to isolate himself greatly, but towards the end of 1934 he showed less agoraphobia, driving frequently outside the town, and appearing somewhat oftener than was his wont in society. He let it be known in December that it was intended to raise his post to the status of a Legation as from the 1st January, 1935, and that he would remain at the head of it with the rank of Minister Besident. No official announcement has been made up to the time of writing. Germany. The German consulate has remained unoccupied since the departure in 1933 of M. Heinrich De Haas, the honorary consul appointed in 1931. Iraq. Sayyid Kamil-al-Gilani, formerly Iraqi consul-general in Beirut, was in January 1934 appointed Iraqi Charge d'Affaires in Saudi Arabia and consul- general at Jedda. He arrived in Jedda on the 17th June. This young man of 35 was thought in Bagdad to have derived little benefit from his education, which included a sojourn of some years at the American University in Beirut, and to owe his advancement rather to the influence of his brother, Rashid Ali Bey A1 Gilani, a former Prime Minister of Iraq, than to any marked ability. When we exchanged visits last June, I had little reason to question this appreciation, though his smile mitigated my first impression of shifty eyes in a sombre face, and I was struck by his apparently considerable knowledge of Arabian affairs and certain persons concerned in them. Few opportunities have since offered of getting to know him better. Though correct and friendly in his relations with Mr. Calvert, when they have met, he has shown no inclination to frequent the British Legation and seems to prefer the society of members of the French consulate. He has a very moderate knowledge of English. He does not appear to have a wife in Jedda. Italy. Signor G. Persico, whose appointment as Italian Charge d'Affaires was announced late in 1933, arrived in Jedda on the 24th March, 1934, coming direct fiom a post in the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His previous career had been spent largely in Russia, with interludes in Istanbul and Cairo. His age is probably about 40. He had no special knowledge of Arabian affairs when he came to Jedda, and does not seem to have acquired more than a very general grasp of them since. It was understood, when he arrived, that he was intended loi the post of Minister, as soon as the situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen should ha\e become easier, but his promotion has not yet been announced. Dunng the acute stage of that situation, he impressed Saudi officials by his mo eration and readiness to see their point of view; and in his relations with i ie i i 1 V i • ^ e § a ^ lon . proved himself an agreeable colleague, very ready to e le p ul m connexion with the one important matter of common interest which has arisen, apart from the question of Saudi-Yemen relations. His chief claim to distinction has been the zeal and efficiency with which he has created a garden in the strip of ground outside his house, with soil imported from Egypt and plants from various sources. This garden is one of the wonders of Jedda and has cost M. Persico a pretty penny, which he can afford the more easily as he is EngHsh moderate^ ^ entertam ed very little. He speaks French well andNetherlands. • iqq ^'' 1 4: ( ^ r \ a . anse ' w ho succeeded M. van der Meulen as Chare:6 d'Affaires n 1931. is, like him, a member of the Dutch East Indian civil service He is Se™ f S ll0W - He does DOt s P eak English as well as his predecessor, but has quite an adequate command of it.

Adriaanse. except that his winter visit to Sana is now an annual event. P Persia. Mohamed Ali Khan Mogaddam, to adopt his own spelling, arrived in Jedda early m January 1934 and proved to have been appointed a full Minister, unlike ms predecessor. He does not appear to be much more than 40, but had had twenty-seven years service before coming here. In old days he was employed in the Persian Embassy at St. Petersburg, and was later, after the war, counsellor m London. He subsequently became consul-general at Tashkent, and finally served for two years as ' chef de cabinet ' in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs ^T^nraji He does not seem to have made any particular impression on British omcials m his previous posts. I have seen comparatively little of him here, but he is an agreeable colleague, with pleasant manners and a most ingratiating smile. He has some knowledge of English, but prefers to speak French, which he knows fairly well. As a Moslem he is eminently latitudinarian. He keeps his family in the Lebanon, and was away with them from early in June until Decembei. He did not treat this as absence from Jedda, regarding the Lebanon, presumably with the consent of his Government, as one of our outer suburbs. Soviet Russia. *M. Nezir (or Nezir Bey) Turakoulov is the doyen of the Diplomatic Body. He is a round-headed Moslem from Turkestan and has distinctly Tartar features. His age is 38. He seems intelligent and has a considerable aptitude for languages, having acquired a good working knowledge of Arabic, greatly improved his French and started on English since he came to Jedda about three years ago. We converse a good deal in Turkish, the language in which he is most at his ease. # We are quite good friends, but meet comparatively rarely, as M. Turakoulov goes little into European society. In the summer of 1932 he appeared to avoid me on purpose, possibly owing to the complications of the then situation. When we do see each other we never approach any kind of political subject, but exchange folitesses and simple stories. In this sort of talk M. Turakoulov displays a lively sense of humour. I think that he is genuinely more interested in com mercial and economic subjects than in politics, and is content to devote himself to the uphill task of marketing Russian goods (he did an important deal in petroleum products in 1931, but is still whistling for the money), and securing the removal of the restrictions still imposed by the Saudi Government, in principle at least, on direct trade with Russia. He presents no appearance of wishing to make a splash, but after my departure in September 1932 he came out of his shell again and even gave a diplomatic dinner. I used to think him a good Moslem, but have modified this opinion. He, nevertheless, poses as a believer, is attentive to local personages and affects Arab head-dress. (Written in January 1933.) M. Turakoulov hardly ever leaves this country, and his wife, a plump and blonde non-Moslem from Samara, now lives with him uninterruptedly. She engages in dispensary work in Jedda, and during a long stay they made at Taif last autumn she apparently helped to doctor the Royal harem. M. Turakoulov's own qualities tend on the whole to become more and more negative, but he gave another diplomatic dinner recently, and he no longer pretends in European society . to be a strict Moslem. He will drink whisky on occasion, even in Ramadan.4 T UTJcbu *Celal Bey has been Turkish Charge d'Affaires for a little over a year, in which time he has spent about eight months here. He was formerly an army officer and did part of his service m the Yemen up to the time of the Turco-Itahan War. He is now a man of perhaps 45 or more. He seems to know Arabic well, and, I believe, speaks Italian, but his French is elementary. He entered the Turkish foreign service some years ago and betore coming to Je da had held consular posts at Rhodes, Damascus, Cyprus and, I think Alexandropol. From the little I know of him I should judge him to be a pleasant and easy-gomg man, a superficially modernised example of the old 1 urkish school, not highly competent in any direction. If he has any impetuosity, he shows it in the handling of his., wireless sets, which are powerful but very apt to go wrong under his management. His wife, a good example of the modern Turkish woman, not spoilt by progress, could not bear Jedda. Though apparently quite attached to him, she fled after a stay of barely a month to superintend the education of their son in Istanbul, and left Celal Bey to lead the simple life of an ancien militaire. This dispenses him from making any attempt to entertain while in J edda, though he is reputed to be quite well off. (Written in January 1934.) Celal Bey has changed in no respect, except that one hears less of his wireless and more of the precautions which he thinks necessary to preserve his apparently excellent health. Islam sits lightly on him, as on most Moslem foreign repre sentatives in this country. His wife has never again faced up to Jedda, but his prolonged absences enable him to see much of her elsewhere. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 'S GOYERNM] _ . - — —— — EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. February 11, 1935. S ection 2. [E 982/588/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received February 11.) (No. 19.) Sir, Jedda, January 27, 1935. WITH reference to my telegram No. 12 of to-day's date, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the identic note addressed to my French colleague and myself by the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 18th January regarding the proposal to hold a conference to deal with technical problems connected with the Hejaz Railway. Fuad Bey Hamza handed this note to me on the 20th January, saying that he had delivered a similar note to the French Charge d'Affaires the evening before. I delayed reporting until I had time to compare notes with the French consulate, which M. Maigret left in charge of his Syrian assistant on the 21st J anuary, in order that our translations should agree. 2. The translation now enclosed agrees in all material particulars with that made by the French consulate, and I have reason to hope that it is at least as accurate in detail. I am a little doubtful, however, about two points. The first relates to the words rendered ' from its establishment ' in paragraph 2. An alteration of the pronoun might relate the material word to the preceding word '' question '' and give the sense '' the question of the line from its foundations ' or 'in its fundamental aspects.' This distinction is not worth pursuing, but the second point is of great material importance. My translator has used the word '' reservation '' in the phrase immediately preceding the reservation formula and the word ' reserve ' in the formula itself. The French translator takes the same view and uses the conventional ' fait toutes ses reserves' in his version of the formula. The Arabic words, however, are inflexions of two different verbal derivatives from the same root, and it might conceivably be held that the word used in the actual formula meant ' preserve ' rather than ' reserve.' I attach sufficient importance to this that I enclose a copy of the Arabic formula in case you should wish to consult experts.^) 3. The two most striking features of the substance of the note are the evasiveness of the language used regarding the Lausanne declaration and the definiteness of the reservation, especially if the meaning I have suggested can be read into it. 4. The language of the Saudi Government regarding the Lausanne declaration must be read in conjunction with their note of the 16th March, 1929, a copy of which was enclosed in Mr. Jakin's despatch No. 83 of the 10th April, 1929. In that note they contested the validity of the declaration on various grounds, the most important of which were that it did not take account of the Wakf character of the line and the Sharia Law and that they had not themselves been a party to it. They now express readiness to modify theii attitude, but I do not think that this means that they abandon the position which they took up in 1929. It means rather that they abandon the position which they took up in 1928, when they sought to insist on a discussion of the fundamental questions of the ownership and the alleged W^akf charactei of the railway, as a condition of discussing the technical questions. 5. I confess my own inability to see how the British and French Govern ments can on their side insist on the acceptance of the Lausanne declaration as a necessary preliminary to a technical conference. They did not do so in the note which their representatives addressed to the then Hejazi Government on the 12th January, 1928, in pursuance of the instructions in Foreign Office telegram No 52 of the 29th December, 1927. What they did later was to say that, if the question of ownership, &amp;c., were to be discussed, they could only be discussed on the basis of the declaration, but the thud paiagiaph of Sn Austen [331 1—2] [ l ) Not printed.Chamberlain's despatch No. 234 of the 26th ^November, 1928, shows that they were still prepared for a resumption of the purely technical conference without laying down other conditions than that it should have the limited scope contemplated in their proposals of the 12th January, 1928. It appears to me to be difficult now to enforce a different view, and 1 think that the Saudi Govern ment have some ground for considering that they could not accept the Lausanne declaration without prejudice to the question of the status of the railway, which they wish to reserve. 6. Quite apart from these considerations, it seems to me that the British and French authorities might be considerably embarrassed if, after a technical conference had taken place on the basis of that declaration, Ibn Saud then held us to the strict letter of the declaration and insisted on an advisory board at Medina. 7. It is all the more important to examine closely the form given to the Saudi reservation in the enclosed note, as their own contentions regarding its status and character have in the past been more positive than any counter- statements by the British and French Governments in correspondence with the Saudi Government. The two Governments have relied on the Lausanne declaration, but that declaration did not in terms define the status of the railway, It merely affirmed its religious character and assumed that its ownership had passed to the succession States. I am aware of the strong arguments in favour of this assumption, but I am now concerned only with what has passed between us and the Saudi Government. 8. My conclusion, which I state with some diffidence, is that the question of acceptance of the Lausanne declaration as a basis of the technical conference should not be pressed; but that the reply to the Saudi reservation should be most carefully considered so as to make it clear (a) that it is allowed to stand on record as a reservation and nothing more; {h) that His Majesty's Government and the French Government do not accept the claims implied in the reservation; and (c) that if the Saudi Government should at any time reopen the question of the status and the character of the line, they would be on their side entirelv free to contest these Saudi claims. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's High Commissioner for iransjordan and to His Majesty's consul-general at Beirut. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1.

The British and French Governments, however, did not agree to that suggestion, and insisted upon the point that any discussions m V Government desire to enter into regarding the Hejaz Railway should be based on the Lausanne declaration of the 27th January, 1923. The result of the adherence ol: each party to its point of view was that the question has till recentlv been relegated to one side. ^ My Government have already explained their definite attitude regardiner the said Lausanne declaration, but, being desirous that their persistence in this attitude of theirs should not be an obstacle in the way of the repair of the line resumption of train services, and being convinced of the great advantage which will be enjoyed by pilgrims generally, and in particular by the countries through which the line runs, have found it better to modify their former attitude and to accept an mtei mediate solution in order to reconcile the viewpoints of all concerned, and have decided to agree to the separation of political matters relating to the line, namely, its ownership, unity, privileges, and the like, from the technical matters relating to the repair of the line and the resumption of services. In accordance with the readiness shown by the British and French Governments, by the oral communications conveyed by your Excellency, to agree to a renewal of discussions on technical matters, as had already been decided before the Conference of Haifa was held, the Government of His Majesty the King desire to make the following reservation in regard to other than technical questions :— The Government of His Majesty the King reserve their full rights in the matters relating to the ownership, unity and privileges, &amp;c., of the line and (their right) to raise these questions at a suitable time with the authorities concerned, and agree now to the holding of a conference, of which the time and place will be fixed, for the discussion of the technical matters upon which depend the repair of the line and the resumption of train services.' I should be very grateful if your Excellency would be good enough to communicate this to the British and French Governments, and to inform me in due course of the place and time which they suggest for holding this conference, in order that the Government of His Majesty the King may take the necessary steps for their participation therein.

Sir 5 I had the honour to inform you 'briefly in my telegrams rlos* 6C and 61 of March 15th of the attack on Ion Saud and tne Heir Apparent in Mecca that morning# As usual on such occasions the affair rapidly became the subjecu o± a mass of varying and often conflicting rumours hut none of the variants appeared to me to be of sufficient importance to telegraph* I now enclose translations of two communiques? which we.^e telegraphed to the foreign missions on March 15th and 20th. These 5 especially the latter5 are probably more trustworthy than any of the numerous other versions that have reached me» 2« The facts that the attempt was made within the precincts of the mosque and was made during the greatest festival o: f&gt; the Moslem year not only add to its dramatic interest but invest it in the eyes of Moslems with a peculiarly sacrilegious character.. The religious law may be susceptible of different interpretations but the broad principles may be summed up in the statement that gratuitous bloodshed? whether of man or animals 5 is at all times forbidden in the sacred precincts of Mecca and that the festival entails a sort of Truce of God between enemies* The principles are so strongly held that the question may be raised in quarters critical of Ibn Sauci yi /hether the slaying of his assailants in the noly Place /was Right Hon ou r ab1e ir John Simon ? G.C.S.I. ? !.G.V.0. e 0 o «&gt; p e u c • ? - */./was necessary to stay their impious hands and therefore unlawful,, The historical instances of 'bloodshed in the actual mosque would appear to have 'been extremely rare. Indeed one informant states that the only case on record is that mentioned in Muir's Life of Muhammad (page 4i0 of the 1923 edition) and that that is doubtful. Even the second communique leaves certain points indeterminate© It is not clearly stated that the two policemenj who were struck downj lost their lives but it is probable that one if not both were killed- The wound of the Heir Apparent is understood to have been rather more serious than is implied but in any case it was not grave- It is tacitly suggested that the King suffered no hurt. I am assured^ however 3 that he was slightly wounded in the leg by flying splinters,. It was thought at first that a bomb might have been thrown but the more accredited theory now is that the splinters were struck out of the marble pavement by the firing of the guards. The communique discloses doubt regarding a point of some importance i.e. whether there was a four'th assailant who got away. 4. There was some panic in Mecca and a great deal at Mina ? where large numbers of pilgrims were congregated for the festival. There is no doubt that feeling in the King's entourage was greatly inflamed. Tnere v^as icilk of a general onslaught on Yemenis and of arresting Abdullah al-.azir, who, as you will remember came to 'cne Hejaz last year for the peace negotiations and established intimate personal relations with Ibn Saud and who is now back again as a greatly honoured pilgrim. Happily the King /himselfhimself displayed both courage and good sense. It appears to be true that he and the Heir Apparent completed the sevenfold circuit of the Kaaba though I believe that they abandoned the further rite of passing the prescribed number of times between Safa and Marv/a. The King, moreover ? gave stringent orders that there were to be no gratuitous reprisals. The police are said to have made a good many arrests and even to have used torture but there was no promiscuous attack on Yemenis, which might have led to massacre, 5 0 There have naturally been various theories as to the origin of the incident. Some suggest that it was due merely to the indignation of the assailants at being thrust aside by the guards to make way for the Kingc Yemenis are said to be very quick with their daggers, when offended# This theory is possible but on the whole improbable&gt; as, if the men had not gone to Mecca with the special object of making their attempt ? they would probably have performed the pilgrimage* Assuming that they did go there with that object, it becomes a question whether they did so from motives of private vengeance or by instigatiom People in MecCa have been very ready to believe that they were selr on by high personages in the Yemen, not indeed by the Imam Yahya, but by others with rankling memories of the past, e 4 g» the Imam's eldest son Ahmed, whose dissatisfaction with the issue of the war and general restiveness are notorious!, It might be inferred from the stress laid by the Saudi communiques on the fact that the criminals were not only Yemenis but Zeydis and from the account given of their passports /thatthat the Saudi Government leant to this view.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 28.) (No. 4. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, January 7, 1935. I HAVE the honour to refer to my confidential despatch No. 204 of the 2nd July last, relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitchell, representative of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to Jedda report for December 1934, paragraph 304, and preceding reports, where the varying fortunes of Mr. Twitchell, engaged over a period of some six months in negotiating with the Saudi Arab Government a concession to exploit minerals in this country, have been periodically recorded. The successful conclusion of these negotiations was noticed in the report under reference and was announced in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 28th December in a short article, which described the concession, signed on the 23rd December, 1934, as one for the exploitation of the gold and other mineral resources of the country, with the exception of oil and other liquids, over a restricted area. The agreement, the article stated, would shortly be ratified, and thereafter the text would be published. 2. Pending the publication of the text of the concession, the following particulars, partly disclosed in conversation by Mr. Twitchell himself, and partly received from other sources, are of interest; (a) The Government are to be assigned 15 per cent, of the shares in any companies to be formed to work particular concessions, a provision which, it is gathered, proved unpalatable to Mr. Twitchell, who favoured the assignment of 15 per cent, of the initial nominal capital rather than 15 per cent, of shares actually issued, as and when issued, a point on which he found himself obliged to yield. Mr. Twitchell stated that he successfully resisted the desire of the Saudi Government to participate, to the extent of 15 per cent, of the shares, in the existing syndicate, a holding for which the Government were even prepared to pay. (b) The Government is to receive 5 per cent, of any gold eventually extracted, (c) Customs duty is to be paid at a fiat rate of 10 per cent, on all material, &amp;c., imported, (d) The area finally agreed on under the concession is, roughly, the whole of the Hejaz and Asir as far south as Birk, with the exception of certain reserved areas, notably about the Holy Cities. This general description was given by Mr. Philby, who said that the area first approved by the King extended as far as meridian 44 degrees, thus including a considerable slice of Nejd, but that it was later decided to set the eastern limits much more to the west. Mr. Twitchell, who did not allude in any detail to this point, expressed himself generally as quite satisfied with the area actually allotted, (e) The agreement, according to Mr. Twitchell, must be ratified by the syndicate, after which it will be published. 3. It is gathered that Mr. Twitchell is to be joined by M. * de Poll? ^h e Dutch Moslem who has for some years resided in this country, wheie loimerl}' he had commercial interests in work connected with the concession, although presumably in some non-technical capacity. Mr. Twitchell left Jedda foi ^gypt and Syria on the 26th December and is understood to be actively engaged m making arrangements for prospecting, and, if a report from Messrs. Ge a y, Hankey and Co. that a large consignment of pit-props has been ordered through them by Mr. Twitchell is to be believed, for early mmmg operations as well 4.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received February 12.) (No. 27.) Sir, Jedda, January 29, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 92 of the 23rd March, 1933, regarding the relations between the Saudi Arab Government and the Soviet, I have the honour to state that a Soviet official named Guertik has been attached for com mercial work to the Soviet Legation here for three or four weeks past. I gathered at first that he might be a permanent addition to the staff, but it now seems more likely that he will not stay long and is merely on a tour of inspection. This is borne out by a statement in the Aden Intelligence Report for the fortnight ending the 2nd January that he is expected at Hodeida shortly. He is there described as ' inspector-general of Russian oil business.' 2. The following is a summary of an account given of M. Guertik by the local manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited): He appeared to be agreeable, unaggressive and less reserved than many Soviet officials. He disclaimed any idea of launching a commercial offensive and declared ; ' Je ne veux pas la lutte.' He discussed with Mr. Black the position in regard to certain staple imports here and appeared to recognise that in some lines, e.g., sugar and petrol, the Soviet trading organisations would find it difficult to compete in Saudi Arabia at present prices. M. Guertik seemed to be interested in the marketing of Soviet manufactured goods and actually sounded Mr. Black as to whether Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) would accept an agency for their sale. 3. It may be worth mentioning that another Russian commercial expert named Kondrachoff recently visited Jedda. He is a member of the Soviet Agency in the Yemen and stayed' here only a short time, awaiting an opportunity of proceeding to Russia via Port Sudan. 4. Apart from the above facts, I have observed no recent signs of any special activity on the part of the Russian Legation here. The Soviet Government may, however, be planning a fresh commercial campaign and there have been some indications of a desire on the part of the Legation to cultivate relations with the powerful Saudi Minister of Finance. On the other hand, there was a story last October that the Soviet Minister gave as one reason for hesitating to commit himself to a ten years' contract for a house the possibility that his Government might at any time abolish his post. i i? i o • 5. I take the opportunity of mentioning that the personnel ot the Soviet Legation, not including M. Guertik, is now composed as follows : - Nezir Turakoulov, Minister, Moslem, with a non-Moslem wife. Shakir Ismailoff, Moslem, with wife, possibly Moslem. Dr. Toukov-Rowanski, doctor, with wife, non-Moslems. Morsen, dentist. 6.

(No. 96.) ; Sir, • r Jedda, March 27, 1935. THE Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qv/a of the 21st March reached me too late to be used in drafting my despatch Ncrf 86 of the following day, relative to the attack on Ibn Sand in the Great Mosque at Mecca on the 15th March. When received it proved to contain a great deal of interesting matter besides the two communiques enclosed in that despatch. The leading article, headed; ' They Wished Evil for him, but their Intrigue has been Frustrated,' presents few features of interest. The most salient were perhaps references to the sword by which this country was conquered and from which the incident would remove the rust that might gather if it remained long in the sheath. The writer was reserved regarding the position which the affair had created. 2. The paper printed twenty telegrams received from heads of States and other personages, together with the King's replies. Fuad Bey Hamza tells me that many other telegrams Avere received, but it must be assumed that, so far as heads of States are concerned, the list was complete up to date, in which case several even of those who are in relations with Ibn Sand seem to have neglected to congratulate him. The heads of States whose telegrams were published were, in the order of printing, those of Great Britain, &amp;c., Iraq, France, Yemen, Italy, Transjordan, Persia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Koweit. The other personages were M. Mussolini, Prince Omar Toussoun, Nahas Pasha, ' on behalf of the Wafd and the Egyptian nation,' the President of the Supreme Moslem Council of Palestine, Prince Muhammad Ali of Egypt, two Syrian notables, viz., Nasib Bey A1 Bakri and Hashim Bey A1 Atasi, Hamad Pasha A1 Basil of Egypt, Mr., C. R. Crane of New York, and the Saudi agent in Cairo. The telegram of the last-named was presumably included because the abnormal position between Egypt and Saudi Arabia had been held to preclude any direct official expression of sympathy and congratulation. The agent reported that visits of congratulation had been paid to him by the Egyptian Prime Minister, the Governor of Cairo and other personages, as well as by foreign representatives. He also mentioned numerous telegrams, including one from His Majesty's High Commissioner and one from Sheikh A1 Maraghi. 3. By far the most interesting telegrams were those exchanged with the Imam Yahya. There were two telegrams from the Imam. One of these was directly inspired by the incident. The other began as an acknowledgment of the receipt of a letter which his courier had just brought back from Ibn Sand, but this also was almost entirely devoted to the attempt on the King's life. Both, especially the second, abounded in the author's usual pious rhetoric. The kindness of the King's letter almost broke the Imam's heart. As for the attack, it had caused that same heart to drip with grief and had filled his eyes with tears. For the rest, he refused to believe that the crime had been the work of Zeydi Yemenis. If it was, they must have been set on by an evil hand outside the Icemen, the hand of enemies disappointed over the conclusion of the I reaty of Tail. He and his were as innocent of it as was the wolf of the blood of Joseph. He had instructed Abdullah-al-Wazir to give every assistance to the Saudi authorities in their enquiries. Replying to both telegrams at once, Ibn Saud affirmed his appreciation of the Imam's feelings in regard to a sorrow common to them both and his confidence in Abdullah-al-Wazir. He himself, he said, had dis countenanced any molestation of Yemeni pilgrims and had charged A1 Wazir to quiet and comfort them. The assailants were, however, undoubtedly persons from the Yemen, and full particulars had been obtained regarding them. The King completely exonerated the Imam himself. 4. The Umm-al-Qura published also a telegram from the Imam Yahya to Abdullah-al-Wazir expressing his grief at the incident, adjuring him to do all in his power, and again expressing the belief that, if the assailants were i emeni, [381 z—4] ^they had come from some wicked place outside the \emen to create disturbance. All the same sentiments run through a long telegram fiom the Yemeni Minister for Foreign Affairs to Fuad Bey Hamza, in reply to a telegiani from the latter, which, perhaps significantly, has not been published. C^adni xvagnib was even more eloquent than his master and supported what he said by curse ^d oath. 5. The same number of the Umm-al-Qura includes, m a short general account of this year's pilgrimage, the reply given by the King to those who offered him their congratulations at Mina. i his is of less interest than the interview mentioned in paragraph 5 of my despatch under refei ence, which also appeared. In the interview the King explained why he had resisted the suggestions of his own people that he should visit foreign lands. He expressed his cautiousness, as a simple Bedouin, unfamiliar with tricks of language, m regard to journalists, who were accustomed to manipulate it. He was, however, ready to answer any questions. Three of the questions put to His Majesty related to the attempt on his life. Speaking of it generally, he convicted his assailants of irreligion. He caring only for the Unity and the protection of what he possessed. He had been saved by God, but his first concern had been the safety of the pilgrims. He described the measures he had taken to close the doors of the Haram and to prevent bloodshed therein, after which he had completed the circumambulation of the Kaaba and returned to Mina. Replying to a second question regarding the investigation and the position of the Imam Yahya in the matter, the King expressed his conviction that the Imam had had nothing to do with it, as 'the man was not devoid of religion ' and their relations were excellent. He left it to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to inform his interlocutors regarding the enquiries which had been made. His Majesty returned a more guarded reply to a third question about the suggestion that Seif-al-Islam Ahmad had been respon sible for the affair. There was much talk, he said in effect, about many persons and he could not go by rumours. He went on to speak of a presentiment he had had at Arafat, how he had thought of means to deal with and arrest an assailant, if one should mingle with the crowd, and how he had then, confiding in God, let it pass from his mind. He went on to say more about the Unity and the purity of the belief of the people of Nejd, who took their stand on the Koran and tradition, as expounded by the four Imams. 6. The King replied to various other questions, which bore less directly on the subject of the present despatch. As his utterances, except as regards Palestine, were not of sufficient importance to report separately, I may as well sum them up briefly here as follows : — (a) He was favourably impressed by the sympathy shown by the Egyptians, who were brethren and with whom there was no cause for dispute. {h) On the Iraqi journalists expressing pleasure at what he had said to the party of Iraqi boy scouts, the King affirmed solidarity with Iraq. (c) I am reporting separately His Majesty's remarks about Palestine. (d) Replying to an expression of Moroccan sympathy with himself and his people, the King said that many of the tribes of Morocco were of Nejdi origin and that Arabs were all of one race. 7. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 25th March adds nothing of interest to the above, except a reference to a sympathetic telegram received bv it from an ^gypt^nlady named Labida Ahmad, who had played a certain role in the past in Ibn baud s entourage. - d ^ j am s 1 endi 2g copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire, Aden and Cairo.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 4 of the 7th January, I have the honour to state that the text of the agreement between the Saudi Government and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 15th February, together with a Royal decree dated the 12th February sanctioning the agreement. It may be assumed that the syndicate had already ratified it. 2. The agreement is a fairly lengthy document, and I consider it unnecessary to trouble you with all the details. I enclose a synopsis showing the principal conditions. In the absence of the annexed map it is difficult to trace the exact boundaries of the assigned area on the south and east, but a very fair idea of them can be formed with the aid of the ordinary maps and the Handbook for Arabia. You will observe that the northern boundary is the de facto frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan, starting from 'Point E,' the position of which is defined as in the Had da Agreement. 3. Mr. Twitchell duly visited Egypt and Syria as foreshadowed in my despatch under reference and travelled as far east as Rutba, whence he went to see the alleged gold mine at Gaara. He then proceeded for a short time to England. He returned to Jedda on the 17th February and is now making active preparations to start his prospecting campaign at four places, all of which are in the northern part of the assigned area and the most important of which is the ' Cot of Gold, where he has previously done some preliminary work. He has collected two mining engineers, a British subject named George, who has had much experience in India, and a United States citizen named Ballard, besides a clerical assistant named Bisshopp. He expects a third mining engineer from Australia. M. van de Poll, who was mentioned in my despatch under reference, has already been busy up Medina way and Mr. Twitchell describes him as having done magnificent work. I gather that the general headquarters of the prospectors will be in the first instance at Yanbu , where a house has already been rented. Mr. Twitchell is certainly tackling his enterprise with great energy. 4.

S ection 1, [E 1638/1638/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received March 11.) (No. 54.) Sir, Jedda, February'tt, WITH reference to Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 362 of the 4th December, 1934, relative to Saudi-Egyptian relations, I have the honour to state that on the 11th February the Saudi Minister of Finance told my Indian vice-consul that the Egyptian Government were sending 20,000 ardebs of wheat for distribution svakeic to the poor at Medina, and that certain Egyptians in Egypt had collected in a fedki few days only £1,200 for the relief of the inhabitants of that city. I understand itobi that an ardeb is about 5^ bushels. 2. The news that the wheat was a gift from the Egyptian Government, as such, was confirmed in a grateful article in the Umm-al-Qura of the 15th February, which stated that the Saudi Government had agreed to exempt the gift itkli from customs duty and other charges. The first consignment arrived in the Misr ,siiijeclfe I Navigation Company's pilgrim steamer Kawthar on the 16th February, gtolt 3. The position as regards the money is not quite so clear. There may be a fund in Egypt for the relief of the poor of Medina, but, if so, the Umm-al-Qura ^ gii did not mention it. On the other hand, the same issue of the 15th February stated that the Misr Navigation Company, with the participation of the Banque Misr ra j[ ra ; and other benefactors, had given donations to the total of £2,250 gold, through Talaat Pasha Harb, for specific purposes connected with Saudi hospitals at Mecca and Jedda. The Pasha had already given £E. 10 on his own account, when he was last here, and had promised further assistance. 4. These charitable activities have attracted a good deal of attention in local circles. They are worth recording in connexion with the peculiar state of Saudi- Egyptian official relations and with the commercial enterprises of the Banque Misr in this country, into which they seem to be putting a good deal of money. 5.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 27th February relative to the concession recently granted by the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to state that the Royal decree sanctioning the concession referred to an agreement and contract as having been signed by the Minister of Finance and the representative of the syndicate. It now appears that these were two separate instruments as, after the agreement summarised in the enclosure to my despatch under reference had been published, the Umm-al-Qura proceeded to publish, in instalments, an even lengthier document described as a contract concluded on the same date as the main agreement. 2. Although the further document is described as above, it is clear from internal evidence that it is a form of mining lease for fifty-eight years, in respect of areas to be finally selected for definite mining operations in accordance with article 3 of the main agreement. The procedure contemplated would appear to be that the Government will lease these areas to the syndicate on the conditions laid down in the 'contract,' and that the syndicate will form subsidiary companies to work the individual properties. As the general conditions are stated in the main agreement, I do not think it necessary to report at length on the ' contract,' the detailed stipulations of which appear to follow normal lines. The following points, however, may be noted ;— (a) The Government are to receive during the period of the lease a rent of £1 per feddan of the leased area plus the excess, if any, of 5 per cent, of the product of the mine over the rental so fixed. (1) The special arrangement for payment of customs duty on imported supplies, &amp;c., at a flat rate of 10 per cent, will operate throughout the period of the lease. (c) The Government are not only to receive gratis 15 per cent, of the share capital of the eventual subsidiary companies, fully paid up, but they are to have the right to nominate a director to serve on the board of each company, the total membership of which shall not exceed six persons. 3.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received April 8.) ■(No. 86.) Sir, Jedda, March 22, 1935. I HAD the honour to inform you briefly in my telegrams Nos. 60 and 61 of the 15th March of the attack on Ibn Saud and the heir apparent in Mecca that morning. As usual on such occasions, the affair rapidly became the subject of a mass of varying and often conflicting rumours, but none of the variants appeared to me to be of sufficient importance to telegraph. I now enclose translations of two communiques which were telegraphed to the foreign missions on the 15th and 20th March.(^ These, especially the latter, are probably more trustworthy than any of the numerous other versions that have reached me. 2. The facts that the attempt was made within the precincts of the mosque and was made during the greatest festival of the Moslem year not only add to its dramatic interest but invest it in the eyes of Moslems with a peculiarly sacrilegious character. The religious law may be susceptible of different inter pretations, but the broad principles may be summed up in the statement that gratuitous bloodshed, whether of man or animals, is at all times forbidden in the sacred precincts of Mecca and that the festival entails a sort of Truce of God between enemies. The principles are so strongly held that the question may be raised in quarters critical of Ibn Saud whether the slaying of his assailants in the Holy Place was not more than was necessary to stay their impious hands and there fore unlawful. The historical instances of bloodshed in the actual mosque would appear to have been extremely rare. Indeed, one informant states that the only case on record is that mentioned in Muir's Life of Muhammad (p. 410 of the 1923 edition), and that that is doubtful. 3. Even the second communique leaves certain points indeterminate. It is not clearly stated that the two policemen, who were struck down, lost their lives, but it is probable that one if not both were killed. The wound of the heir apparent is understood to have been rather more serious than is implied, but in any case it was not grave. It is tacitly suggested that the King suffered no hurt. I am assured, however, that he was slightly wounded in the leg by flying splinters. It was thought at first that a bomb might have been thrown, but the more accredited theory now is that the splinters were struck out of the marble pavement by the firing of the guards. The communique discloses doubt regarding a point of some importance, i.e., whether there was a fourth assailant, who got away. 4. There was some panic in Mecca and a great deal at Mina, where large numbers of pilgrims were congregated for the festival. There is no doubt that feeling in the King's entourage was greatly inflamed. There was talk of a general onslaught on Yemenis and of arresting Abdullah-al-Wazir, who, as you will remember, came to the Hejaz last year for the peace negotiations and established intimate personal relations with Ibn Saud and who is now back again as a greatly honoured pilgrim. Happily, the King himself displayed both courage and good sense. It appears to be true that he and the heir apparent completed the seveniold circuit of the Kaaba, though I believe that they abandoned the further rite oi passing the prescribed number of times between Safa and Maiwa. Ine b^uig, moreover, gave stringent orders that there were to be no gratuitous repiiSials. Ine police are said to have made a good many arrests, and even to have used toiture, but there was no promiscuous attack on Yemenis, which might have e o massacre 5. There have naturally been various theories as to the origin of the incident. Some suggest that it was due merely to the indignation of the assailants at being thrust aside by the guards to make way for the King. Yemenis are said to be very (juick with their daggers, when offended. This theoiy is possible, but on the who e improbable, as, if the men had not gone to Mecca with the special object o ma i g ( l ) Not printed. [381 h—6]c\ o x &lt; 2 their attempt, they would probably have performed the pilgrimage. Assuming that they did go there with that object, it becomes a question whether they did so from motives of private vengeance or by instigation. 1 eop e in ^ ecca have been very ready to believe that they were set on by high personages m the Yemen, not, indeed by the Imam Yahya, but by others with rankling memories ot the past, ^ a the Imam's eldest son Ahmed, whose dissatisfaction with the issue of the war a'nd general restiveness are notorious. It might be inferred from the stress laid by the Saudi communiques on the fact that the criminals were not only Yemenis but Zevdis and from the account given of their passports, that the baudi Govern ment leant to this view. If they adopted it definitely the incident might possibly have important political repercussions. I am told, however, by Mr. Philby (a) that it is recognised in high quarters that, although the passports were signed by one of the Imam's sons, this is a normal way of issuing passports at Sanaa; and (b) that in an interview given to journalists on the 19th March the King himself exonerated the King of the Yemen and his sons from any responsibility for the outrage. I have not vet seen this interview, but, if Mr. Philby's statement is correct, it would apear that Ibn Saud has already taken his line and will not let the affair outwardly affect the relations of this country with the Yemen. 6. I am told that the first telegrams of congratulation on his escape which reached Ibn Saud were that of His Majesty King George and that of the Imam. The latter is said to have disclaimed responsibility, and suggested that the outrage was the work of some unspecified ' foreign finger.' This is not the first time that the Imam Yahya has adjured his brother-Arab King to beware of foreigners, meaning Powers that are neither Arab nor Moslem. Ibn Saud has sometimes echoed the Imam's sentiments in this respect, but it is interesting to note in the present connexion that, three days before the incident at the Kaaba, when addressing the notable pilgrims assembled at his annual banquet, he scouted the theory that foreign influences had brought about the Saudi -Yemen quarrel of last year. 7.

His brother Salih had returned to the Yemen last year after two protracted absences separated by a short interval, the the first in unnamed foreign countries, the second in Abyssinia, He had taken out a passport and accompanied Ali on the Haj. The third, Mabkhut Ibn Mabkhut was a soldier, belonging to the same village, Beyt Hadhr, as Ali and Salih, He had set forth on the pilgrimage without leave and therefore counted as a deserter.

The commission confessed their complete failure to discover anything ahout the proceedings of the three, or four men, their connexions with other people or any plot. They surmised that the passport of Mes'ad, or whatever his name was, had been taken out in a false name hy some one not 'belonging to the Yemen, who might have escaped after the outragec They noted darkly the absences of Salih from the Yemen and hinted that the clue might be found in the countries he had visited, but observed pl^ntively that they had no means of investigating his activities abroad. The Umm-al~Qura published this inept document without commento It is increasingly evident that the Saudi Government have no intention of magnifying the affair into a cause of open quarrel with the Yemen, The Yemeni author ities, though compelled to admit that the assailants killed at the Haram were Yemenis, cling fondly to the suggestion that they must have been egged on by outside instigators. 5, I am sending copies of this despatch to the G-overnment of India^ Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire, Aden and Cairo, I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

[E 2569/74/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received April 23.) (No. 89.) Sir, Jedda, March 24, 1935. AS you are aware, Ibn Saud makes it his annual practice to give a great banquet in Mecca for notable pilgrims of all nations just before the pilgrimage. I find that I sent no separate report on this event last year, but I included some account of it in my despatch No. 85 of the 31st March, 1934, on the Saudi Yemen situation. This year the occasion merits separate treatment. 2. This year's pilgrimage has brought to the Hejaz an unusually large number of Moslems of high standing and a good many politicians of less note, but of some importance in their own countries. The former have included ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan; His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur; the chief Begum of his Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, with Sir Nizamat Jung in attendance; another Begum of the Hyderabad family; the Glawi from Morocco; Abdullah-bin-Wazir, the Governor of Hodeida, who was here last year as Yemeni delegate at the peace negotiations; Nawab Sir Umar Nayat Khan, honorary A.D.C. to His Majesty the King; and a brother of the Sheikh of Dibai. 3. Most of the male personages just mentioned were among the 500 guests or so whom the King entertained on the evening of the 12th March. As the King had arrived only on the 10th March, the arrangements were made hurriedly. Among the absentees were the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who pleaded illness, and Sir Umar Nayat Khan, the reasons for whose non-appearance I do not know. The Nawab may have been worried about questions of precedence, but members of his suite attended the dinner. The King had ex-King Amanullah on his right, with Sayyid Hasan-al-Idrisi, and, I believe, the Glawi beyond. The second place of honour on his left was given very significantly to Abdullah-al-Wazir. 4. The King's principal speech' was reproduced, as usual, in the Umm-al-Qura, probably in an edited version. The published version is not worth submitting to you in full, but a few points may be noted. He began with his customary exhortations and insistence on the importance of close adherence to Moslem tenets, especially the doctrine of the Unity. He and his were Bedouins, possessing nought except the blessing of God and desiring the co-opeiation of Arabs and Moslems. The King then spoke of the events of last year an referred speciallv to the past enmity between himself and the Idiisi and Ai Wazii, who were now sitting at his table. The war had shown, he said, the disadvantages of discord to both sides. Moslems generally had welcomed the peaceiul ending and he invited them all to work together. The most interesting passage m is speech was that in which he scouted the idea that foreign influence had caused the quarrel. Moslems and Arabs were themselves responsible for their differences. In their press utterances they raged rudely against each other but were polite to occidentals. If they respected themselves, co-operated and fo owe e ng path they would succeed. . . , , • f i 5. Ex-King Amanullah delivered a speech which was also reported m the Umm-al-Qura, but in a very anodyne form.. The published c 's no mention of his two principal points in trying to make whic e r RP . bricks. He urged the desirability of general Moslem coMerences at p lgnmiigc time, and boiled when his remarks were coldly received. You will lemembe that Ibn Sand convened such a conference in 1926 and ^ 'f' e fV,? t P trfffio in embarrassing experiment. Amanullah Khan s othei po nt slaves was all wrong and should be abolished in au Irn- l ip • itself was clearly ill chosen for the expression of this sentiment, so admirable m i e , and means were found to silence the orator. ^ ^ pi,, Hi no- bv 6. There were, I understand numerous ^ a speaker whom I have not identified, . w ^ • i rgnort besides the King- Afghanistan. The only orators named m the official repoit, besides the g [381 z—6]and Amanullah Khan, were Muhammad-al-Ghumaymi -al-Taftazani and a certain Muhammad Sadiq-al-Mujahid. The latter I take to be the adversary of Ibn Sand on whom His Majesty's Government have long had their eye, but who recently returned to this country under the terms of the recent so -called amnesty. \1 Taftazani belongs to a family of some religious consequence m Egypt, who claim descent from the Prophet. His importance lies in the fact that in the past he has been a violent critic of Ibn baud, especially, if I remember rightly, but I have not verified this, at the time of the Idnsi revolt m Asir in 1932. He is understood to have praised the King highly in ms speech at the dinner. The sincerity of these conversations may be doubted, but the lip-service of such former enemies shows how greatly the events of last year ha\e enhanced Ibn Saud's credit in outer Moslem and Arab circles. 7.

Signor Persico, Italian Minister at Jedda, travelled with the party. On the arrival of the Victoria, in which the visitors were travelling, a salute of twenty-one guns was fired. Signor Caffarelli of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs met the Emir Saud, who also received a repre sentative of the High Commissioner, the Commander of the Port and other officials. During the day he visited the sights of Naples, and in the evening received the ten Saudi airmen who are being trained at Grottaglie. On the 20th May the Emir was given lunch by the Prince of Piedmont, leaving for Rome the same afternoon. 3. On arrival in the capital on the evening of the 20th May the party were received by Signor Suvich, Signor Medici del Vascello (Under-Secretary'to the Presidency), Signor Bottai (Governor of Rome), Count Geriodi di Monastero (Master of Ceremonies of the Court), and Major Roero di Cortanze (aide-de-camp of the King of Italy). On the 21st May the Emir had lunch with the King, and in the afternoon was received by Signor Mussolini. Next day the Emir visited the Air Ministry, leaving for Florence on the 23rd May. He returned to Rome for the Fascist Levy on the following day, and then left again for the north of Italy, where he is at present. 4. Nothing has appeared in the Italian press in regard to the subjects discussed with Fuad Bey Hamsa during the present visit; but it is fairly evident that a certain amount of business was done. From a well-informed source I learn that the chief Italian desiderata were that Fuad Hamsa should request King Ibn Saud to consider the possibility of— (1) Taking steps to counteract the propaganda in the Hejaz of the Senussi emigres which, in the opinion of the Italian Government, is doing much to foster anti-Italian sentiments among the Arabs as a whole; (2) To assist recruitment of Arabians by the Italian authorities in Eritrea; and (3) To accept the view that the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia is simply a quarrel between two Christian nations, in regard to which the Saudi Government should maintain a strict neutrality. 5. Finally, I have the honour to enclose a memorandum by the military attache on a tactical demonstration stages by the Italian military authorities for the benefit of the Crown Prince. 6.

ON Thursday, the 23rd May, I attended a tactical demonstration held near Civitavosshia for the special benefit of the Saudi Crown Prince. His Majesty the Ivmg was present, together with Greneral Baisti occhi and a number of Itciliciii The exercise does not call for any detailed description. It consisted in an attack by two infantry battalions against an imaginary enemy holding a line on a ridge facing the spectators and marked by white screens. The attack was supported by four groups of artillery (twelve batteries), including a group of 105-mm. guiis and a group of 149-mm. (6-inch) howitzers. After a time the advance was supposed to be checked, and a flank attack was launched by a battalion of bersaglieri, with eight tanks and some cavalry. Apart from the fact that, for the benefit of the spectators, the turning movement was not as wide as it would have been in a real battle, the whole exercise was realistic and well carried out. The artillery and machine guns fired live ammunition and expenditure was on a liberal scale. An Italian officer, who was bear-leading the Saudi Crown Prince, told me yesterday that the latter was duly impressed, particularly by the artillery fire which was apparently a novelty to him. 1J ' R.

WITH reference to paragraph 2 (c) of my telegram No. 98 of the 20th April last and previous correspondence relative to the slave trade and slavery in Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to submit a general report on what passed between Fuad Bey Hamza and myself on this subject before Fuad Bey left for Syria and Europe on the 1st May. I trust that this will facilitate further discussion when our conversations are resumed in London. 2. I reported in my telegram No. 80 of the 4th April that Fuad Bey had asked me to study the preliminary draft of a personal letter with draft regula tions on slavery. He handed me these documents simultaneously with the draft note on the future of the Treaty of Jedda, on which I reported in my despatch No. 113 of the 11th April. Having dealt with the question of procedure in that despatch, I need not pursue it further here. 3. As I stated in my telegram No. 80 of the 4th April, the draft regulations suggested by Fuad Bey left much to be desired. I preferred, therefore, to keep the discussion on a personal plane and not to submit them for your consideration without making an attempt to get them recast in a more acceptable form. As, however, they still represent the only definite proposals made by Fuad Bey, I now enclose translations of his draft letter and the two enclosed regulations, which I have marked A and B. 4. I told Fuad Bey on the 5th April that I saw no chance of the proposed regulations sufficing to induce His Majesty's Government to renounce the right of manumission. Among other things, I drew his attention to various ambiguities in the wording, and suggested that article 1 of Regulation B would read to the uninitiated almost more like a legalisation of the slave trade than as a condemna tion of it. Fuad Bey expressed readiness to amend the ambiguities and said that Regulation B was not intended for publication. This caused me misgiving, as it is this regulation which contemplates the registration system. After some discussion, I offered to give Fuad Bey privately my own suggestions as to how the regulations might be improved. He accepted this offer, which I made on the distinct understanding that I could make personal suggestions only and could not commit His Majesty's Government in any way. 5. Some delay ensued owing to pressure of other business on my side and indisposition on that of Fuad Bey, but I gave him my suggestions on the 18th April in the form of an unofficial memorandum. I enclose a copy of this document, in the preparation of which I kept well in mind the various points raised in the correspondence on the subject, including your instructions and, so far as I consider them practicable, the considerations urged by Sir Geoige Maxwell. When I handed the paper to Fuad Bey, I again explained that the suggestions were entirely personal. I pointed out that I might seem to be asking for a good deal from the Saudi point of view, but that the question presented veiy great difficulties for His Majesty's Government also. 6. Fuad Bey fell ill again after this and we were unable to discuss tne matter further except for a few minutes during our last conversation on the eve of his departure. I gathered that he was not unfavourably disposed towards my suggestions. He was honest enough to say, however, that the total prohibition of the importation of slaves might present difficulty in the case of the Yemen, as slavery prevailed there also, and it would be going very far to say that no slave could be brought across that frontier. As we were not discussing the ma e closely, I did not pursue this, but I took the opportunity of saying that, whatever might be thought of persons born in slavery, the case of persons wioagu y enslaved deserved serious attention. I mentioned instances which had come to my notice of children who had been kidnapped from Moslem families, m g , be in the past, but who stil! remembered their origin. [406 dd—5] B7. Fuad Bey's remark about importation from the Yemen may appear discouraging, but it has at least the advantage of showing that he is approaching the problem seriously and not merely in the spirit of giving every sort of assurance lightly in the hope of getting round His Majesty's Government. He made one other interesting admission when I stressed my point about kidnapped slaves, and mentioned two cases, in one of which he is personally interested. He said that a large proportion of the existing slaves were persons who had been kidnapped in childhood. I did not suggest to Fuad Bey, and I do not believe, that there are many cases of kidnapping nowadays. 8. I postpone any further observations, as I hope to be in London soon after this despatch reaches you. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. ml Enclosure 1. Fuad Bey to Sir A. Ryan. ilktlie (Translation.) Dear Sir Andrew, Mecca, March 30, 1935. YOU will remember that we have on several occasions discussed the position arising from article 8 [szc] of the Treaty of Jedda and the two letters attached thereto concerning the slave trade and the emancipation of slaves under certain conditions. Having regard to the discussions now in progress regarding the renewal or the extension of the operation of the Treaty of Jedda and to the desire of my Government to manifest their wish for co-operation within the scope of article 7 of the said Treaty of Jedda; to abolish the slave trade gradually and to institute a new system for the manumission of slaves more suited to present circumstances; to secure at the same time the general humane object; and to put an end to an irregular state of affairs in regard to the purely internal administration of the Government of His Majesty, I send your Excellency a copy of the arrangements drawn up by the Government for action in accordance therewith. It is evident from this that the co-operation provided for in article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda has been accomplished in the most perfect and complete . . manner, and consequently there will be no reason remaining for the British consu] , at Jedda to interfere in the matter of the slaves who approach him of their own accord applying for emancipation. I shall be glad to obtain the consent of the British Government to the proposed cancellation, because the authorities concerned in our Government will act in accordance with the arrangement referred to.

Should the one complained against fail to fulfil the conditions, the authorities concerned have the right to warn him a second time, and if he does not obey, or repeats the ill treatment, they will have the right to compel the one complained against to release the complainant from his control altogether. Art. 4.—The authorities concerned referred to in this regulation are the Ministry of Interior in the Metropolis and the Amirates in the districts. When the complaints referred to in the preceding above article are to be considered, the authorities concerned will constitute a committee, consisting of a representative on their behalf, the Director of Police, and a member of the Administrative Council, for the consideration of the case and judgment therein. Regulation B. Article 1.—It is forbidden to engage in slave trading except by an annual licence under specified conditions. Art. 2.—-Every conveyancing of slaves must be done with the knowledge of the chief of the profession. The same should be recorded in an official register approved by the authorities concerned in the Government. Anyone who makes or helps in making any transactions concerning slave trade without registering e V; it in the special register will be severely punished. Art. 3.—All slaves existing at present should be registered in a special register u r of the authorities concerned. Every slave should be given a paper of identity !c ■ to be kept by him or his owner, and therein his photograph should be affixed. All 11 particulars which show his personality should also be mentioned therein. !l Dealings relating to him should likewise be shown therein. Owners of slaves -J; should accomplish the registration formalities within one year from publication mt 0 f regulation.

Enclosure 3 m '' Personal Suqqestions by Sir Andrew Ryan regarding Pafei* A and B [Slavery Drafts). IT would be better if all the provisions of the papers, except paragraphs 1 and 2 of Paper B, were included in a single public regulation and to embody paragraphs 1 and 2 of Paper B in instructions to the authorities c ° lu&gt;e ™ . 2. The public regulation might be divided into two chapters deal ing with (1) Enslavement and importation, i.e., slave trade m the usual sense, (2) slaves existing in the country. . . ^ p-n a Ao n^nrii 3. Chapter I would correspond with article 1 of Paper A. As the condi d tions under which the Shari'a sanctions enslavement no longer ex^t as between S audi Arabia and any other country, would ^e Possi^ jifi.absolutely (a) all importation of slaves into baudi Arabia } t jI p ( niirr Wp or ^ (^) the enslavement in the country of free persons, an ^ ^ j to f. x jjdio possession of any slaves imported after the date of e pro , heads jtoJ separate penalties for violation of the prohibitions undei ec i f - k „ n ? jpo# for persons violating them or aiding and abetting m leu vie [406 dd—5]4. Chapter II would correspond to articles 2 and 3 of Paper A, and articles 3 to 6 of Paper B. Article 2 of Paper A lays down an excellent general principle but article 3 does not seem to go far enough in the direction of preventing hard' ship. The following suggestions are made ;— (a) If a slave complains of ill treatment, the parties shall be summoned and if the complaint seems justified, the owner shall be warned as suggested; but the owner shall be bound to produce the slave within a stated period, say one or two months, for further examination If the authorities consider that there has been a continuance of serious ill treatment they shall compel the owner to manumit the slave forthwith. If the case is less serious, they may warn the owner a second time and require him again to produce the slave after a similar period and, if the ill-treatment has continued, they shall then compel the owner to manumit the slave. A penalty should be fixed for failure to produce the slave. (b) Any slave who can prove that he was born free and was unlawfully enslaved at any time in the past may apply for manumission, and the courts shall not refuse on any ground to entertain the application. (This raises a question of how bona fide owners should be compensated.) (c) Married slaves shall not be separated against their will or deprived of their children. A penalty shall be fixed for violation of the prohibition. {d) If any slave applies for a Kitaba, the owner shall not refuse it, and if they cannot agree on the amount to be paid the authorities shall fix the amount and the instalments to be paid. The existence of a Kitaba will not interfere with the operation of {a) above. (e) Any slave born outside Saudi Arabia and manumitted under (a), (h) or (d) above, or otherwise (Ataq Istilad, &amp;c.), shall be free to return to his or her country of origin. 5. Article 3 of Paper B. —It would be better if the identity paper were made out in three copies, one to be kept by the slave, one by the owner, and one by the local authorities. Particulars of marriage and children should be registered as well as transactions affecting the slave. Failure to observe the rules regarding registration to be punishable as proposed. 6. Articles 4 and 5 of Paper B to be maintained. A third chapter might contain miscellaneous provisions, e.g.:— («) Xo person to be allowed to engage in transactions concerning slaves, as agent or broker, except such as are permissible under the regulation. ^7 Sllc ^ P erson otherwise than as an intermediary for bona fide lawful transactions, or to be allowed to hold slaves for re -sale.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 11) (No. 149.) ; Sir, Jedda, May 15, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 108 of the 5th April, I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd May published a fairly long report, dated the 26th April, by the special commission appointed by the King of the Yemen to enquire into the circumstances of the attempt on Ibn Saud's life on the 15th March last, together with a short formal letter of the 29th April, in which the Yemeni Minister for Foreign Affairs forwarded the report to Fuad Bey Hamza. These documents are not worth submitting to you in full. 2. The Yemeni Commission stated that they had investigated the ante cedents of the persons implicated in the outrage and named in the second communique enclosed in my despatch No. 86 of the 22nd March. One, Ali-bin- Ali-al-Hadhri, proved to be a subordinate officer in the Yemeni army, of good previous character, who had got leave to make the pilgrimage. His brother Salih had returned to the Yemen last year after two protracted absences separated by a short interval, the first in unnamed foreign countries, the second in Abyssinia. He had taken out a passport and accompanied Ali on the Haj. The third, Mabkhut-bin-Mabkhut, was a soldier, belonging to the same village, Beyt Hadhr, as Ali and Salih. He had set forth on the pilgrimage without leave, and there fore counted as a deserter. The commission could find no trace of any person corresponding to the passport in the name of Mes'ad-bin-Mes'ad (or some similar name, for variants are mentioned) which was found among the effects of Ibn Saud's assailants. 3. The commission confessed their complete failure to discover anything about the proceedings of the three or four men, their connexions with other people, or any plot. They surmised that the passport of Mes'ad, or whatever his name was, had been taken out in a false name by someone not belonging to the Yemen, who might have escaped after the outrage. They noted darkly the absences of Salih from the Yemen and hinted that the clue might be found in the countries he had visited, but observed plaintively that they had no means of investigating his activities abroad. 4. The Umm-al-Q.ura published this inept document without comment. It is increasingly evident that the Saudi Government have no intention of magnifying the affair into a cause of open quarrel with the Yemen. The Yemeni authorities, though compelled to admit that the assailants killed at the Haram were Yemenis, cling fondly to the suggestion that they must have been egged on by outside instigators. 5.

WITH reference to my Savingram No. 13 of the 23rd May last and previous correspondence relative to the manumission and repatriation of ' Royal ' slaves by this Legation, I have the honour to record two recent cases as follows :— (i) On the 15th April a slave belonging to the King's brother, the Amir Muhammad, took refuge in the Legation. I delayed the usual action for a couple of days, in case the Saudi Government should themselves approach me. They did not do so, and the procedure followed its usual course, unopposed by the local authorities. The man was embarked for Abyssinia on the 3rd May. (ii) On the 14th May a slave belonging to another brother of the King, the Amir Abdullah, took refuge. In view of the recent precedent at (i) the usual procedure was followed. On this occasion the local authorities demurred at the last moment to the man's embarkation, which had been arranged for the 20th May, and intimated that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin would probably speak to me. He did so that morning and invoked the alleged understanding between the King and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton. It was clear, however, that Sheikh Yusuf was merely making a half-hearted personal attempt to get round me. He desisted when I offered to telegraph to you, but said that, having regard to the precedents, I would wish to be able to explain the difference between the Amir Abdullah and the Amir Muhammad. The man was embarked later in the day, as arranged. 2. It must not be inferred from the ease with which these cases have been disposed of that Ibn Saud and his Government feel less strongly than they did about the Legation's right of manumission and the question of Royal slaves in particular. It is merely that they do not wish to become involved in controversy over individual cases at a time when they hope to secure by other means the abandonment of the right of manumission. Even Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has the sense to see that this is sound policy, though his feelings on the subject are so strong that he could not resist the temptation to make a little demonstration in connexion with the second case.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Netherlands were, during the past week, honoured with a visit from His Royal Highness the Emir Saud-bin-Abdul Aziz-al-Saud, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. 2. The Emir was received by Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina, who conferred upon His Royal Highness the Grand Cross of the Order of Orange Nassau. He also took lunch with the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs. I took an early opportunity of writing my name in the Emir's visitor's book at the Hotel des Indes. 3. In connexion with the visit the press has reported an interview accorded by the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. In this interview the Minister is recorded as pointing out the importance of the pilgrim traffic between the Netherlands East Indies and his country, which used to amount to 60,000, but has since then decreased considerably. As regards his own country, the Minister stated that the number of motor cars and trucks in Arabia amounted to 2,000. The economic relations between the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies were maintained by an office of the Netherlands Trading Society, which was the first to open a bank in Arabia; the late representative of the society had, at the request of the King, arranged the finances of the country. 3 a . The sanitary services had also been organised by a Dutchman, Dr. van der Koog, who was a specialist in tropical hygiene. 4. Although there was no broadcasting station in Arabia the number of receiving sets was steadily growing, as the programmes from the Arabic station in Cairo were easily received. 5. The Minister added that he had had an interview with M. Plesman, the director of the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, and the possibility had been discussed of this company taking its route across Arabia instead of across Persia, which would mean a reduction of 1,500 kilom. The Arabian Government had promised co-operation, though a decision had not yet been arrived at. 6. The principal imports from Java consisted of sugar, but the Minister anticipated that other produce could also be obtained from that country. 7.

The Saudi Arabian Minister in London and his first secretary, M. Mahmoud Riyad Zada, were also included in His Royal Highness's suite for the official part of the visit. The date of the Amir's arrival was changed at the suggestion of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba from Saturday, the 15th June (as originally proposed), to the following Monday, the 17th June, in order to avoid beginning the visit at the end of a week. 2. As you are aware, the Amir, with his suite, was the guest of His Majesty's Government for two weeks from the day of his arrival. The period of official hospitality ended at noon on the 1st July, but His Royal Highness is prolonging his stay in a private capacity in this country until towards the end of the present month. 3. The Amir was received on his arrival at Dover Harbour with a Royal salute of twenty-one guns. A military guard of honour was mounted on the pier, and His Royal Highness was formally welcomed by the mayor and corporation of Dover and by the secretary.

Some difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable decoration to be conferred on the Amir, in view of the undesirability of giving him a decoration superior in status to the Grand Cross of the Order of the Indian Empire held by his father King Abdul Aziz. It was finally decided that the Order of the British Empire would be most suitable, and the Grand Cross of that Order (Military Division) was bestowed on the Amir Saud on the 1st Julv. Later in the same day minor decorations of the Order of the British Empire were m^PnM to the following members of the Amir's suite : — Dr. Midhat Sheikh A1 Ardth. O.B.E. Muhammad Sheykho, M.B.E.

Pire% IN continuation of my despatch No. 191 of the 11th July, regarding the visit to England of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, I have to inform you that His Royal Highness the Amir Saud, accompanied by the members of his suite, left this country on the 22nd July on the return journey to Saudi Arabia, and proceeded to Paris. 2. The Amir was seen off at Victoria Station by the Lord in Waiting, repre senting His Majesty the King, and Mr. J. B. Monck on behalf of myself. His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, officials of the Foreign Office, members of the rderolS; Diplomatic Corps in London and a considerable number of other persons, Ml including prominent Moslems resident in England, were also present to take leave present il of His Royal Highness. I enclose herein an extract^) from the Times of the Moffb 23rd July, containing the text of messages which were addressed by the Amir at the time of his departure to the press and the general public, with a view to untn- ti expressing his gratitude for the hospitality he had received in this country. Mi fc 3. You are already aware, from my telegram No. 88 of the 18th July and nee, ilsj from other correspondence, of the position reached as a result of the series of itrj.ii' political conversations that have taken place with the Deputy Saudi Minister for yisitskij Foreign Affairs during the course of the visit. fever, J 4. In addition to the engagements mentioned in the last two paragraphs of tionofk; my despatch No. 191, the Amir visited, during the last fortnight of his stay, the ajiok Bank of England, the Royal Mint and the offices and studio of the British UQtiiff Broadcasting Corporation. His Royal Highness also undertook a short motor rmofp: tour in the Midlands, in the course of which he spent a night at Stratford-on- jjglfg Avon and visited the works of the Humber Motor Company. I 5. In his despatch No. 148 of the 27th May, recording the departure of the ,j | as jJ Amir Saud from Jedda at the outset of his journey to Europe, Sir Andrew Ryan )n( j 0D f r : referred to the belief that His Royal Highness would return by way of Turkey, p Syria and Iraq. This appears, in fact, to have been the original intention, but : early in July the decision was taken (for what reason is not known) to abandon the idea of visiting these countries. It was suggested at one moment that the visit to Amman, which had been definitely arranged as a result of telegraphic correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah (copies of which were enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 159 of the 25th May), should ^ also be given up, and the Amir return by the direct sea route to Jedda. It is understood, however, that King Ibn Saud eventually insisted upon the visit to Transjordan being carried out, in view of the fact that the Amir Abdullah s invitation had already been definitely accepted, and that it would be discourteous to cancel the visit. . . . 6. According to present arrangements the Amir and his suite will spend some time in France and Switzerland (it is understood that a proposal to visit Germany has not been pursued) before embarking on the Egyptian steamship El Nil at Genoa on the 7th or 8th August. The ship is expected to arrive at Alexandria on the 12th August, and after spending the night m Alexandria His Itayal Highness will proceed the next day by train direct to Jerusalem, where he will arrive on the 14th August and stay at Government House for two nights, before proceeding to Amman on the 16th August. His Royal Highness proposes to return to Jerusalem from Amman on the 19th August and to leave the following day for Suez, where he will embark on the 21st August or the 22nd August on the Khedivial Mail or the Lloyd Triestino steamer for Je a. 7. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty s Ambassadors at Angora and Bagdad, and to His Majesty's consul-general at Beirut. x am, ojc . SAMUEL HOARE. (») Not printed.

Section 1. f IT [E 4666/4666/25] Memorandum respecting the possib le Candidature of Saudi Arabia for the League of Nations. THE Kingdom of the Hejaz, at that time under the Hashimite King Hussein, was included in the list of original members of the League of Nations attached to the Covenant of the League. King Hussein failed, however, to ratify the Treaty of Versailles and the original membership of the Hejaz in the League accordingly failed to take effect. 2. In 1926 Ibn Saud, already Sultan of Nejd, conquered the Hejaz and became King of 'the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies,' to quote the Treaty of Jedda concluded with His Majesty's Government in May 1927. 3. The question of the possible admission of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd into the League of Nations was raised in the first instance privately by the League Secretariat in 1929; it was decided, however, that there were many difficulties in the way and that it would be unsuitable for His Majesty's Govern ment to suggest to King Ibn Saud that he would be well advised to join. 4. In July 1930 a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda reporting that the Deputy Saudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey Hamza, had shown some interest in the possible entry of the Hejaz and Nejd into the League of Nations, furnished an occasion for the matter to be exhaustively reviewed in the Foreign Office. A subsidiary point was first disposed of by the legal advisers showing conclusively that there could be no question of the ioint kingdom entering the League on the strength of the Hejaz having been included in the list of original members. Apart from the difficulties inherent on reviving a membership that had never taken effect, they were of the opinion that the Hejaz had lost its national identity and that the joint kingdom, which was a 'real' rather than a 'personal' union (a fact that was confirmed in 1932 by the application to all King Ibn Saud's dominions of the title Saudi Arabia ), was a new creation in world politics and would require a formal application for new membership under article 1 (paragraph 2) of the Covenant. The mam question of the desirability of encouraging King Ibn Saud to apply for membei- ship was then explored. , , 5. It was appreciated that there were certain important arguments that could be adduced in favour of the entry of the Hejaz and Nejd into the League. Membership might lead Ibn Saud towards co-operation with other countries m matters of international concern such as international health control and e development of international communications, especially by air (althougn some doubt was felt about the advisability from a purely British point oi vie j v i n laying stress on the international aspect of e.g. the Arabian air route an e sanitary control of the pilgrimage to Mecca). Another argument (w ic was particularly important in 1930-31 when the Ikhwan raids 1 5 t T ^. bou ^ er ^ o i1 ^ were of recent memory) was the good effect which the entry of King n u territories into the League might have on their relations with Iraq, which was expected to join in 1932; it was felt that the assumption by both eountnes ot the obligations of League membership might facilitate the set emen o disputes between them. . , . .. , „ 1 6. On the other hand there were felt to be serious objections ^ supporting the candidature of a country so primitively organised as the .Saudi which would find it difficult, if not impossible, to participate m the ciYihsmg work of the League. The chief objection was felt to be ^ttitude in Arabia of domestic and industrial slavery and the un i ve J 00 ^ imc i er of official toleration towards it being changed, at least to ^ ex ^ ^ faking the obligations devolving from article 13 of the , ormdition important was the difficulty likely to be experienced m that a State applying for membership shall have established frontiers, the front e 8097 [456 gg—1] 3 E 4920/4920/91 of 1929.

Apart from these general considerations there were objections from the point of \iew of purely British interests. If His Majesty's Government were to encourage King Ibn Saud to seek admission to the League and difficulties were then to arise at Geneva, he might well hold them responsible for any rebuff that he suffered. Moreover, it would be definitely inconvenient for the question of the frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan to be discussed at Geneva. 7 The conclusion reached in the consideration of the question was that Sir A. Ryan should be instructed to adopt a neutral and non-committal attitude # , on the main issues leaving it entirely to King Ibn Saud to decide whether he F ftliattl wished to go any further in the matter or not, and a despatch was drafted in this sense for the guidance of Sir A. Ryan. However, when the matter was submitted to Mr. Henderson, then Secretary of btate, he instructed Mr. Dalton to add a final paragraph to the instructions to the effect that all the considerations mentioned above were subordinate to the general principle that His Majesty's Government desired to see membership of the League of Nations as nearly universal as possible, and could not, therefore, consistently do anything to dissuade a State from applying for membership. Consequently if King Ibn Saud expressed a wish to apply for membership Sir A. Ryan was to say that His Majesty's Government welcomed his decision and would support the candidature of his kingdom at Geneva. 8. His Majesty's Minister at Jedda had little opportunity for personal discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza in the summer of 1931. When the question of entry into the League of Nations did finally come up at a meeting on the 15th July Fuad Bey intimated that his Government had not taken any decision and were merely looking into the matter. His Excellency did not make any request that His Majesty's Government should support an application for membership and Sir A. Ryan, therefore, confined himself to explaining (in reply to an earlier enquiry by Fuad Bey) the legal considerations governing any candidature of the Hejaz and Nejd (see paragraph 4 above). 9. In 1932 the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd became known as 'Saudi Arabia,' but there was no move on the part of the Saudi Government to reopen the question of admission to the League. 10. On the 3rd March, 1933, the Saudi-Arabian Minister in London referred : in conversation with Sir L. Oliphant to the prospect of Saudi Arabia entering the League and requested the opinion and advice of His Majesty's Government. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba explained that he was anxious to avoid any risk of an application by Saudi Arabia for membership being rejected at Geneva; he was certain, however, that an application championed by His Majesty's Government would be successful. Sir L. Oliphant drew attention to the difficulties presented by the lack of definition in certain of the frontiers of Saudi Arabia and the continuance of slavery as an institution, but the Minister was inclined to think L that they were not insuperable. As regards slavery he cited the example of the admission of Abyssinia and added that he had raised this point with King Ibn ig | baud, who felt that if his country were a member of the League it might help him to introduce anti-slavery measures. ^ 11. Sir L. Oliphant concluded his interview with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on ■ 1111T the 3rd March by informing him that His Majesty's Government were rarely, if evei.' prepared to promise their support in advance for an application for member- E2491/840/25. ship of the League. This induced a further visit from the Minister on the tn May, who stated on this occasion that while the Saudi Government did not \ j 1 a c [ e ^ ni ^ e promise of support from His Majesty's Government, they would e g a to learn whether an application by Saudi Arabia for membership would be favourably viewed by His Majesty's Government. Sir L. Oliphant replied by reterrmg once more to the difficulties inherent in the matter, and after some iscussion^heikh Hafiz Wahba agreed not to press his enquiry for the time being 12. ihe action of the Saudi Minister ' • v .. — E 4169/584/25 E 4175/584/25 of 1931. fel Sir E1210/840/25. lor fFo Minutes on E 2491/840/25 of 1933. x ''' p aui/lul1 oi me k ^auoi Minister in reopening the question was the ^ ^ arguments for and against the admission of Saudi Arabia into the Natl ? ns , being reconsidered in the Foreign Office. It was felt that (spp nara errand ^ C k ^ n cur .^ nt w hen the matter was considered in 1930-31 Arab^ wS ri ? Ve ) Were i stl11 , a PP licable and that the admission of Saudi labia would be likely to weaken the League rather than to extend its authority- i HeDespite the intentions attributed to King Ibn Saud by his Minister in London (see paragraph 9 above) there seemed no reason to anticipate that any serious effort would be made to put an end to the institution of slavery as part of the social structure of Saudi Arabia. It was not considered safe to invoke the Abyssinian precedent, since the attitude of the Emperor of Abyssinia towards slavery was less unsatisfactory than that of King Ibn Saud; moreover, the favourable political conditions at Geneva which led to the election of Abyssinia in 1923 were no longer present, and it was probable that the League would be much more exacting in regard to slavery, particularly in view of the forthcoming establishment of its Permanent Commission on slavery. Again, a serious : 7 disadvantage from the point of view of His Majesty's Government was the probability that the successful candidature of Saudi Arabia would increase the discontent felt in Egypt against her exclusion from the League pending the conclusion of a treaty settlement with this country. 13. On the other hand the lack of definition in some of the frontiers of Saudi ontierln, mcWIj rttiec! mtj ft a meetii aken if is goroc Arabia could no longer be considered as an insuperable obstacle, particularly ' since the undemarcated frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq had not been an obstacle to the entry of the latter country into the League in 1932. The ,, , uncertainty on the frontier between Asir and the Yemen appeared to have been • largely cleared up and it was felt that the position in South-Eastern Arabia : might be held to be covered by the Anglo-Turkish protocols of 1913-14. As regards the possible difficulty over the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Trans- jordan it was pointed out that the League had never raised the matter in connexion with the administration of Transjordan by His Majesty's Government under the mandate. In any event it would not be in British interests to lay stress on the lack of definition in the frontiers of Saudi Arabia since it would be highly inconvenient were this to lead to a demand by King Ibn Saud for a definite i| settlement of the Transj or dan-He jaz frontier (on account of the dispute over the i appj Aqaba-Maan district) and for the demarcation of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier (where serious defects had just been discovered in the maps on which that boundary is based). 14. These considerations were placed before His Majesty's Minister at Jedda in a despatch of the 17th May, 1933, together with fresh instructions on the subject. Sir Andrew Ryan was informed that if the Saudi Government showed signs of wishing to press their application His Majesty's Government would not feel justified in actively discouraging them, particularly as it could not be doubted that Iraq and Persia had strenghened their international position as a result of their membership of the League. Provided the Saudi Government realised the obstacles to their election and did not expect His Majesty s Govern ment to sponsor the candidature there did not seem to be any strong counter vailing reason for deterring them. In the event of his receiving any further enquiries on the subject Sir Andrew Ryan was to adopt an attitude of complete but sympathetic neutrality, refraining from anything which might be taken as a rebuff but doing nothing to encourage them to proceed hastily in the matter. ^ At 1JH ^ the same time he should give the Saudi Government any information they might 1 . V desire, while not minimising the obstacles in the way of their candidature. In .W the event of the Saudi Government attempting to secure a demarcation oi their ' frontier with Transjordan on the grounds of its necessity as a precondition to en ^ League, Sir Andrew Ryan was to refer to the Secretary of State for further instructions. . „ i\ 15. No more was heard of the matter for over a year, but m the course oi a meeting at the Foreign Office on the 24th September, 1934, the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned that his Government might be inclined during the course of the prospective negotiations with His Majesty s Government for a general settlement of outstanding questions to raise once more the P ossl ^ e eilt iy of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations. Fuad Bey thought that the proposed settlement would dispose of the difficulty arising out oi Saudi Arabians lack of fixed frontiers; he hoped, moreover, that some progress would be made in the course of the negotiations on the slavery issue, so that it might be possib e for Saudi Arabia to follow the precedent of Abyssinia and apply for admission ^ the League in advance of the total abolition of slavery. The matter was no Pursued further but in an. interview which Fuad Bey gave to a journalist a Damascus the following month he stated that the possibility ol Saudi Arabia entering the League was under consideration. , [456 gg—1] B 2 d L c i Ai sty's W sty's P itio or tliFo 4 , 1 16 The question of a Saudi application for membership of the League of AT A A ill anv form during the recent series of discussions at the Foreign SlrL'h' uad b C™ the fourse of a discussion with Mr Rendel on thfsrd July, about the proposal for a new treaty between Saudi Arabia and Iraa the Iraqi Foreign Minister stated, however that he proposed to urge the Saudi Government to apply for membership of the League. Mr Rendel adopted . a non-committal line towards this suggestion but drew his Excellency s attention p* 1 to the difficulties inherent in the question. Nun Pasha seemed, nevertheless to be confident that the admission of Saudi Arabia could be arranged on the precedents of the entry of Abyssinia and Afghanistan. 17. In view of the interest Nuri Pasha is taking m the matter it seems likely that His Maiesty's Government may again be invited before long to support the candidature of Saudi Arabia for the League. Recent developments have scarcely tended to diminish the obstacles and objections to this development, ine dimculty over frontiers is now acute, since His Majesty s Government have at the moment reached something like a deadlock with King Ibn Saud over the boundaries of his kingdom in Eastern and South -Eastern Arabia, and a similar state of affairs v - 1 seems not improbable on the Saudi-Transjordan frontier, where the frontier is in |f of the a very confused state owing to the hopeless inaccuracy of the maps on which it is -I based. It would be highly embarrassing for His Majesty's Government if these questions (which are most important from the point of view of their proteges, the Amirate of Transjordan, the Arab States in the Persian Gulf and the tribes of the Aden Protectorate, apart from the requirements of Imperial strategy) were to be involved in an attempt by Saudi Arabia to enter the League. 18. Even more important is the revelation in the course of the last few months of the grave risk which the League runs in admitting semi-barbarous countries. Although Saudi Arabia is very far from possessing the attractions of the Abyssinian plateau, there are distinct possibilities of it being found to contain important oil and mineral (chiefly gold) resources; there is a considerable possibility of the present strong Government collapsing on the death of King Ibn Saud, and a period of civil war and chaos would then arise that might sorely tempt a predatory and land-hungry Great Power to intervene in Arabian affairs, lit of lug As against the above considerations may be set the possibility of the entry of ^ Saudi Arabia into the League providing a useful encouragement at a time when the League's future is clouded by the Italo-Abyssinian crisis. Moreover, the slavery difficulty is likely to diminish, since the Saudi Government now appear disposed to make a serious advance towards the eventual suppression of slavery in their country. 19. For convenience of reference the considerations which appear to be valid at the present time (from the point of view of His Majesty's Government) for and against the entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations are summarised in a table attached to this memorandum.

WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 80 of the 18th March, concerning the concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to submit a general report on the activities in the Hejaz of the syndicate since the ratification of the concession by King Abdul Aziz on the 12th February last. 2. It will be recollected that the concession allowed the syndicate three months in which to get to work, a year for general prospecting and another year for further research in selected areas, after which leases were to be granted to subsidiary companies formed to work the individual property. Mr. Twitchell seems at present to be well ahead of this schedule. He set to work, with great energy, immediately after his return to Jedda on the 17th February. The Australian, a Mr. Shanks, mentioned by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 56 of the 24th February, arrived with a British clerical assistant on the 27th February, and the whole party set out early in March for Yanbu and the Northern Hejaz. 3. After four months prospecting and assay work Mr. Twitchell seems to have decided to concentrate, for the moment, his attentions on the gold workings at Mahd-adh-Dhahab (' Cot of Gold '), and has withdrawn Mr. Shanks from Yanbu-an-Nakhl where he has been working without successful results. 4. Mahd-adh-Dhahab was visited for three weeks in June by Mr. E. D. McDermott, one of the directors of the syndicate. On his return to England early in July, followed on the 24th July by Mr. Twitchell, who hoped to travel from Egypt by air, it was reliably reported that a subsidiary company had been formed to work the area containing this mine. 5. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab gold mine, which is situated at 24° 15' N. and 41° 10' E. at a height of 3,550 feet above sea level, is said to have been worked by Harun-ar-Rashid and perhaps even earlier in the times of the Jahilfya. The extensive workings and the large area covered by ruined buildings show that a great number of workmen were employed in those times. Mr. Twitchell is now seeking to prove that the workings were not exhausted of their gold, but were abandoned either through the lack of engineering equipment and the knowledge how to mine deeper, or through the failure of the water supply or from political reasons. . 6. Mr. Twitchell has been working at this mine himself and says he is very gratified with the results so far obtained in the mining of gold. There are, I believe, also subsidiary metals. He foreshadowed early developments and hoped to start diamond drilling, the machinery for which was on its way. Mr. Twitchell is, however, faced with many problems. I am not competent to judge the scheme from a technical mining point of view, but engineering problems may well be smal compared with other factors such as the supply of water and communications with Medina and the coast. • i i. i 7. Mr. Twitchell confessed to me in conversation that the water supply was indeed a problem and said it might be necessary to sink a well. At present water is found in the surrounding districts at Maden (3 kilom.), diraisiya (10 kilom.), and Suwaijiya (50 kilom.), while at the mine itself Mr wi c e has discovered a shaft containing water, estimated at about 7,000 gallons, w ic he intends to reserve for use in connexion with the diamond dn mg. 8. With his usual energy and with Mr. van de Poll s local knowledge m support, Mr. Twitchell has set to work to solve the problem of communications^ Mahd-adh-Dhahab lies, as the crow flies, some 100 miles from Medina and 240 from Jedda. The original plan was to use Yanbu as a base, being only 200 miles [481 t—4]2 from the mine, but during these four months the road has been found very difficult. Non-Moslems have to leave the beaten track from Yanbu to Medina and circle the forbidden area to the north, making the road distance about 315 miles, and mostly over abominable ground of Harat lava, where in the winter the trucks were once or twice held up by rain floods. Ihis combined with the abandonment of the workings at \anbu-an-Nakhl have induced the syndicate to consider the possibility of a road from Jedda, which will be a little longer than the Yanbu road, and which would give the advantages of quicker external communication through the larger port. 1 hey are accordingly now occupied in prospecting three alternate routes ;— (1) Jedda-Asfan-Al Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab. (2) Jedda-Rabigh-Madh-adh-Dhahab. (3) A route between these two. None of these routes is at all practical at the moment; to quote Mr. van de Poll, who made a preliminary prospecting journey through to the mine on the Rabigh route, he only went forward because he knew he could not go back. It remains to be seen which, if any, of these three routes are chosen. 9. Well sinking, road making and the provision of food and medical treat ment in the middle of unknown desert can only be a costly affair; it argues a wealth of optimism in the promoters in the possibilities of the undertaking. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to the High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. I have, &amp;c. A. S.

OJN the receipt of your telegram No. 26, Saving, of the 23rd July, Sir Miles Lampson approached the Prime Minister and His Majesty's ' chef de cabinet ' with the request that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia should, on his passage through Egypt, be shown suitable attention and afforded all possible facilities. Subsequently the Prime Minister informed me that every civility would be shown to the Prince, and that a special saloon would be provided for him and his suite on the Egyptian State Railways. Nessim Pasha added that King Fuad had reluctantly consented to the Governor of Alexandria, Hussein Sabry Pasha, meeting the Prince on his arrival; that no one would go from the palace, but the Governor could nevertheless be described as representing the King. Aly Maher Pasha, however, later informed me that the Governor would represent the King, and added that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had at his request telegraphed to the Governor, who was then in Palestine, to ensure his return in time. 2. Incidentally, Nessim Pasha deplored this rancorous attitude of King Fuad, and stated that there was no longer any cause for the continuation of bad relations between Egypt and Arabia. 3. The Prince and his suite arrived at Alexandria on the Egyptian steam ship Nil at about 4 p.m . on the 12th August, and were met on board by Hussein Sabry Pasha, the Governor, and by myself. A number of officials and notables, including the Saudi Agent in Egypt, the Afghan Minister, the Iraqi Charge d'Affaires, Talaat Harb Pasha, and representatives of Egyptian Arab tribes were also present to receive His Highness. A crowd on the quay cheered the Prince as he descended the gangway, and the people who lined the streets accorded him a friendly welcome. It is perhaps worthy of remark that at a time when a violent anti-Nessim and anti-British campaign is being conducted by almost the entire Arabic press, the crowds on this occasion showed no sign whatever of anti- British sentiment, but, on the contrary, applauded the Residency car on its journey through the streets. The Iraqi Charge d'Affaires subsequently assured me that the explanation was to be found in the fact that an act of courtesy to a neighbouring Moslem State met with general approval, but the occurrence tends to confirm the Prime Minister's contention that the present press campaign has hitherto been largely artificial, and is being instigated by the political enemies of the present regime. The Prince proceeded immediately on landing to Ras-el- Tin, where he inscribed his name in the palace book. He was received at the palace by the master of ceremonies and by Mohammed Hussein Bey. From the palace he went to the Hotel Cecil, where he spent the night. During his stay in Alexandria the Prince received visits from a number of Egyptian and Aiab notables. , , , ,, 4. As the Saudi Arab Agent in Egypt had given me to understand that a call on the Prince during his stay in Alexandria would be appreciated, I paid a short courtesy call on him at 5*30 p.m . at his hotel. During the mteiview t e conversation was confined to subjects of general interest. With reference to his stay in England, His Royal Highness spoke very earnestly of his gratitude to their Majesties the King and Queen, and said that he event which had most impressed him during his whole tour had been the naval leview. The proceedings were enlivened by the Amir's amusement on finding that the aide-de-camp who accompanied me was a brother officer of Captain Chamberlain, who so lately erred and strayed from his ways into Saudi territory. On the following morning Fuad Bey Hamza returned the visit and called on me at the Residency. He volunteered ['481 cc—2] f' ^ ,: l' 12 in a formal manner that he was fully aware that bn Miles Lampson was responsible for the special courtesies extended by the Iiigyptian Cxovernment. On account of King' Fuad s obstinate misundei standing of past 6\ cnts, he did not anticipate any immediate effect on Egyptian-Saudi official relations, but this did not greatly disturb him, as an improvement could only be a question of time. He had called on Aly Maher Pasha and on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and conveyed the Prince's thanks to King Fuad and to the Egyptian Government for the hospitality he had received at their hands. n 5 The Prince left Alexandria at 3 p.m . on the 13th August by special train for Jerusalem. He was seen off at the station by the Governor, by the acting oriental secretary on my behalf, and by a considerable crowd who again cheered His Highness. Before his departure the Prince issued to the press a short state ment expressing his pleasure at his visit to Egypt, stressing the bonds of friendship existing between this country and Arabia, and expressing his hope for the future prosperity of King Fuad and the Egyptian Government and people. 6. His Royal Highness is expected to return from Palestine to Cairo on the 19th August, and he will spend the time until his departure for Suez and Jedda on a Nile steamer placed at his disposal by Talaat Harb Pasha, of Banque Misr. It has not yet been decided whether he leaves Suez by Khedivial Mail steamer on the 21st August or by an Italian steamer on the 22nd August. 7.

Your Eoyal Highness, (After Compliments.) Jedda, August 15, 1935. I HAVE the honour to inform your Royal Highness, nnchr instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have given careful and sympathetic consideration to your Royal Highness's note of the 18th January last, in which the Government of Saudi Arabia proposed that a technical conference should be held to consider the repair of the damaged sections of the Hejaz Railway and the resumption of traffic over the whole length of the line. 2. His Majesty's Government fully share the desire of the Saudi Arab Government for the reopening of the southern section of the Hejaz Railway, and they are also confident that if this object were achieved great benefit would be conferred upon all the territories through which the railway runs. 3. His Majesty's Government, therefore, accept the proposal of the Saudi Arab Government that discussion of the technical matters connected with the reconditioning of the damaged section of the railway and the resumption of traffic thereon should again be undertaken. 4. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken note of the reservations made by the Government of Saudi Arabia in regard to the ownership and status of the Hejaz Railway. They consider it necessary, however, for their part also to place on record that their own position with regard to these matters remains unchanged and is based upon the declaration made at Lausanne on the 27th January, 1923. 5. It will, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, be of advantage to all parties to agree in advance on the precise and complete agenda for discussion at the proposed conference, and they accordingly propose, for the consideration of the Saudi Arab Government, that the following agenda be adopted:— (i) Examination of the degree of reconditioning which the railway requires. , (ii) Preparation of an estimate of the cost of the necessary woi . (iii) Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is (iv) Consideration of a project for the organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway. r ^ r^ninrr-QtopV (v) Consideration of a project for the eventual distnbu 101 g among the different sections of the line. 6 If this ao-ATida is acceutable to the Saudi Arab Government I have the honour to sagged on beh^ Government that the stall assemble at Haifa, in Palestine, on the 10th October next, a chief Palestinian delegate shall preside over the dis(aissions^^ inform me 7.

The Government of His Majesty agree to what has been said m paragraph 5 your note—that the conference should be held at Haifa on the 10th October, 1935 —and agree to the agenda for discussion at the conference and also that the conference should be held on the said date in Haifa.

I AM directed b\ the Secretciiy of StSite tor the Colonies to tr&amp;nsniit to you for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copies of two despatches from the Officer Administering the Government of Palestine (with enclosures), dated the 5th September, on the subject of the visit of the Amir Saud to Palestine and Transjordan. I am, &amp;c. J. L. MAFFEY. Enclosure 1. Officer Administering the Government of Palestine to Mr. Malcolm MacDonald. (Confidential.) Sir, September 5, 1935. I HAVE the honour to refer to your confidential despatch (Transjordan) of the 29th June, 1935, regarding the_yisit of His Royal Highness the Amir Saud to the United Kingdom and subsequently to Transjordan, and to inform you that His Royal Highness spent the period from the 14th to the 19th August in Palestine and Transjordan. 2. When the intention of the Amir Saud to visit this country became generally known, allegations were made in Al J ami'a-al-Arabiya, the organ of the Supreme Moslem Council, that the Government, in entertaining him as an official guest and in drawing up a programme for his movements, intended to prevent free contact between the Arabs of Palestine and the visitor. The High Commissioner, accordingly, directed that the Arab population should be given the fullest opportunity possible of greeting and entertaining His Royal Highness, and reception committees, in which representatives of all Arab political partieb were invited to participate, were formed under arrangements made by the President of the Supreme Moslem Council. The suggested programme foi the period the Amir was to be in Palestine was drawn up in consultation with Haj Amin, who communicated to the local committees the details provisiona \ decided upon. 3. The Amir Saud and his suite arrived at Kantara, from Alexandiia, on the evening of the 13th August, and were there met by my Arab private secretary, who laid before His Royal Highness the programme suggested for his movements in Palestine, and by a senior Moslem police officer who was detailed to remain in attendance on His Royal Highness so long as he was in Palestine. Arrangements had been made in advance that the coaches m w iic 6 party travelled from Alexandria should be conveyed across the uez a , tnat they were able to continue their journey to Jerusalem undisturbed, coaches were attached to the ordinary passenger tram leaving ^antara Palestine shortlv after midnight, but they were detached at Khan ^ , early hours of the morning of the 14th August, and from that station to Jerusalem were run as a special train. This was arranged prmcipa y railway the Arab inhabitants of the towns and districts through which the railway Passes to demonstrate to His Royal Highness their pleasme a • tram was stopped accordingly for a few minutes at each s a ion. [506 gg—5] ^i i 4. An official reception was arranged at the Jerusalem station. I welcomed the Amir on behalf of the Palestine Government, and presented to him the senior officers of Government, a representative of each foreign consulate, and a number of notables among whom the only non-Moslem was Yasub Eff. Farraj, Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and acting President of the Arab Executive. A guard of honour was mounted outside the station oy the 2nd battalion the Royal Berkshire Regiment, and His Royal Highness inspected the guard before entering the car which I had placed at his disposal. He was enthusiastically applauded by large crowds which had gathered to witness his arrival. 5. From the station the Amir proceeded to the Haram-esh-Sherif to perform his religious duty of taking the first opportunity to salute this Holy Place. His car was accompanied as far as St. Stephen's Gate by a trotting escort of Palestine police. In the Haram area, as at the railway station, large crowds had gathered to welcome him. After praying at the Aqsa Mosque the Amir and his suite drove to Government House, where they were to be my guests. The suite comprised Fuad Bey Hamza, his secretary (and brother) Taufiq Hamza, Kheir-el-Din Zerkali, adviser to the Saudi Agency at Cairo, Fahed-bin-Kreidif and Saleh-al- Ali, respectively, secretary and aide-de-camp to His Royal Highness, and a servant. Also travelling with the Royal party, but lodged at the King David Hotel, were Dr. Hamdi, Director of Health in the Hejaz, Sherkh Naser, Saudi Agent at Damascus, and Abdel Rauf Sabban, described as Hejaz Deputy Minister of Finance. 6. After lunch, to which I invited a few Arab notables including the mayors of Jaffa, Haifa, Nablus and Hebron, and one or two Government officers, His Royal Highness and suite drove to Hebron, where they visited the mosque, Returning thence they proceeded direct to a reception at the Rawdat-al-Maaref School, arranged in their honour by the Jerusalem reception committee. 7. In the evening I gave a dinner party to which I invited the members of the Executive Council and a number of Moslem notables and Moslem Government officers. 8. On the 15th August the period from 9 a.m . to 10 a.m . was set aside for the Amir to receive visits at Government House. He then drove to Jaffa, where he was the guest of the local reception committee at a lunch arranged in the house of a certain Yusuf Ashhour. On the way His Royal Highness made a stop at Ramleh, where the population demonstrated their welcome. In the afternoon the party drove from Jaffa to Nablus, where they were entertained to tea by the Nablus reception committee. Halts were made en route at Qalqiliya and Tulkarm, where also His Royal Highness was enthusiastically greeted by the population. 9. From Nablus His Royal Highness and suite drove directly to Government House, where I gave a second dinner party at which the guests included the principal Royal Air Force and military officers, the heads of Government departments, the Anglican bishop, Mr. Shertok of the Jewish Agency, foreign consuls-general, and the consul of Czechoslovakia, who is filling the post of a consul-general, and is, moreover, accredited to Saudi Arabia. 10. On the morning of the 16th the Amir Saud and his suite motored to Amman. As far as the Allenby Bridge they were accompanied by my Arab private secretary and an escort of Palestine'police. At the bridge they were met by the Amir Talal on behalf of the Amir Abdullah, the chief of his Highness's divan, and the Chief Minister's secretary. An escort of two cars of the Desert Patrol of the Arab Legion was provided. The Amir Saud was greeted at Es Salt by the Mutessarif of the Belqa District, and a guard of honour, and from the entrance to the town of Amman to the palace a cavalry escort of the Arab Legion accompanied the cars. 11. His Highness the Amir Abdullah, the Acting British Resident, the Chief Minister and the officer at present commanding the Arab Legion (Major Glubb) received the Amir Saud at the door of the palace and subsequently the members of the Executive and Advisory Councils, heads of departments and officers of the Arab Legion were presented. 12. An official banquet was given at the palace in the evening to which were invited the Acting British Resident, the members of the Executive Council, the financial adviser, the officer at present in command of the Arab Legion, and certain senior officers of the Royal Air Force and the Transjordan Frontier Force. His Highness the Amir made a speech of welcome, of which I attach a translation, and presented a jewelled sword to the Amir Saud. The latter replied in suitable terms. rmessjiiif ^ih\ ■ Saudi k f eputj it I eluding h f iliyaaD(lIi| by tl . cilytoGw 3 13. The morning of the 17th was devoted to visiting Madeba and the excavations of Siagha, Lunch was taken at the palace and was attended by heads of departments of the Trans j or dan Government and officers of the Arab Legion. In the afternoon, a parade ol the Arab Legion was followed by a gathering' of tribesmen and a Bedouin dinner of rice, roast camel and sheep which was eaten at a camp erected for the purpose on the hills west of the palace. In order to avoid raising questions of precedence, His Highness the Amir Abdullah did not attend the parade but was represented there by his eldest son, the Amir Talal. 14. On Sunday, the Amir Saud and suite were the guests of the municipality of Amman at an at fresco lunch in the orchards of Ain Hummar. An informal dinner was given at the palace, after which His Highness the Amir bestowed decorations on the Amir Saud and members of his suite. In return, the Amir Saud gave presents of Arab cloaks to the palace officials. 15. His Royal Highness and suite left Amman by car at an early hour on the morning of the 19th August and drove to the Allenb'y Bridge, where they bade farewell to the Amir Talal and were received by my Arab private secretary. Thence they drove directly to the Jerusalem station, where the ceremonial observed on His Royal Highness's arrival was reversed. 'The coaches in which the Royal party were travelling were hauled to Lydda as a special train, and there attached to the ordinary passenger train proceeding to Kantara. 16. Prior to leaving. His Royal Highness handed me a message, a translation of which is enclosed, for publication. 17. Throughout the whole of his stay in Palestine and Transjordan, His Royal Highness impressed all who came into contact with him by his dignified bearing and charm of manner. He was careful, even at purely Arab functions arranged in his honour, to avoid anything of a political or controversial nature, and his visit was unmarred by any untoward incident. You will have observed that, in the Arab press, the visit of the Amir Saud to Palestine and Transjordan was welcomed as reflecting the re-establishment of friendship between the Saudi and Hashimite families; and particularly as affording first an occasion for drawing attention to the alleged wrongs under which the Arabs of this country were suffering and, in the second place but less immediately, some grounds for the hope that in due time A.rab Palestine might be delivered from its present subjugation by an Arab Prince who could now rightly be looked upon as the exemplar and champion of Arab independence.

The following Message has heen handed by His Royal Highness the Amir Sand to His Excellency the Officer A dministering the Government for Publication. THE two days which I spent in this country, which is full of energy and life, have delighted me and created in me a feeling such as, to say to the least, can only be expressed by thanks to the noble Government and people alike for the great hospitality and generosity with which they have received me. In particular, I am grateful for the kind attention which has been extended to me by his Excellency' the Officer Administering the Government, his alert officers and the zealous members of the police. As regards the Arab people, who received me during my visit as an affectionate father Avould receive his sons and a kind brother would receive his brothers, to this living people who are mine and whose I am, I confess my inability to appreciate adequately their feelings towards me and to express my thanks for all they had shown to me during my journeys in their towns and villages and visits to their institutions. I can only pray to the Almighty God to bestow His blessings upon this people and to direct their steps in the right path. I wish also to thank the Syrian delegates who took the trouble to come here to take part in my reception and to make me feel that I am amongst my family and clan. I shall not forget the way I was received by the press and by all journalists. May God reward them on my behalf and on behalf of the nation of whom they are the spokesmen and whose feeling they express. Enclosure 4. Officer Administering the Government of Palestine to Mr. Malcolm MacDonald. (Secret.) Sir, September 5, 1935. I HAVE the honour to refer to my confidential despatch of to-day's date regarding the visit of His Royal Highness the Amir Saud to Palestine and Transjordan, and to submit the following further observations on certain political aspects of the occasion :— 2. Although the composition of the Arab reception committees as published in the press purported to embrace all parties, in fact none of the leading members of the Opposition (National Defence party) participated, and complete control over the arrangements was thus exercised by the Mufti and his adherents. The reason for the abstention of the Opposition was that they resented the fact that Haj Amin, and not they, had taken the initiative in the matter, thereby securing a political advantage and an enhancement of prestige. They also objected, aiw with some reason, to the inclusion in the local committees of persons of little standing, including in the case of the Jaffa Reception Committee, as I subse quently learnt, a man who had served a sentence of three years' imprisonment for forgery. Both in Jaffa and Nablus, the district commissioners were obliged to hi ing piessure to bear in order to overcome the reluctance of the mayors to attend the leceptions arranged in their towns. They were offended at not having been invited to preside over the local reception committees, a dignity to which they felt themselves entitled as the elected representatives of the population.l0It U 3. Throughout the period during which the Amir Saud was in Palestine J,ea ^i| Haj Amin took every possible opportunity of thrusting himself to the fore and of assuming charge of the Royal guest. So much so, indeed, that on the afternoon of the 14th August, on the occasion of the visit to Hebron, he contrived to seat himself beside the Amir, thereby forcing Fuad Bey Hamza to occupy the small folding seat in front, tuad Bey Hamza was not unnaturally annoyed, and I thought it well to speak to Haj Amin on the subject, with the result that this particular manoeuvre was not repeated on the following day. As was to be anticipated, however, he took to himself the most prominent part in the receptions at Jaffa and Nablus and the intermediate towns, thereby greatly annoying the Opposition faction, whose newspapers have devoted several articles to the subject 4. I enclose herein a copy of a report of the 20th August, submitted by the Acting British Resident on some of the political aspects of the Amir Sand's visit to Transjordan. Abdel Rauf Sabban is identical with the man of that name referred to in the High Commissioner's telegram No. 9 of the 13th January, 1933, and connected correspondence. I also enclose translations of telegrams received by the Amir Abdullah and the Amir Saud from King Ibn Saud, in reply to telegrams announcing the safe arrival of the Amir Saud at Amman, and of telegrams exchanged between the Amir Saud and the Amir iVbdullah after the former had left Transjordan.Q mutt 5 ft i s 0 f interest to record that on the morning of the 14th August, when the invited guests were assembling at the Jerusalem railway station to await the g m i; arr i va i of His Royal Highness, the wai ting Arab crowds gave an ovation to the wcift Abyssinian consul. am, 11: A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, and to f Jedda. ntheiilM I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to refer to my letter of even number, da.ted the 19th August, 1935, on the subject of the visit to Transjordan of the Amir Saud. I 2. The Amir Saud made a favourable impression upon all those whom Ae chofto#*, and his attitude as regards political matters was most correct, j to pafe He ignored pointedly any political allusions made to him in the comse o ^ vations 011 c 1 OIlversa ^ 011 and confined himself to uttering polite expressions of thanks oi the kind reception he had been accorded and to saying how dehghttul it was to feel that all Arabs were brothers. . rr.ii i Hittees^ He was most cordial to His Highness the Amir and the Amirs iaial ana be leafr, Naif. 3. As regards the suite, it was unfortunate that two of the members who came to Amman should be individuals who had shown open enmity a one jother to the Hashimite house. Kheir Eddin Zerqali had to fly 1 soon after the inception of the present regime in order to escape e c01 }® ^ j of writing poetry in which his Highness was the subject of abuse, K 1 k led- was an opponent of the late King Feisal at Damascus dui g nn^.'.

He was also in touch with the Druse refugees of the Atrash family, and Mohamed Izzeddin-el-Halabi, who came to Amman from Nebk in order to meet the Amir baud. || ^ 4. His Highness the Amir was a most courteous host and was at pains to prevent the occasion being exploited foi political puiposes b\ the nationalistic politicians in Syria and Palestine. It was for this reason that he declined to ' accept the visit of Haj Amin-el-Husseini and Ragheb Bey Nashashibi from Palestine and Mohamed Nahas and Shukri Kowatli from Damascus. His J Highness also requested me to instruct the British consul at Damascus to refus&amp; visas for Transjordan to a party of eleven Syrian politicians who desired to come to Amman in order to call on the Amir baud. The exclusion of this party was the subject of adverse comment in the Syrian press. A number of Arab newspaper correspondents both from Palestine and Syria were present, and his Highness received them at the palace on Saturday, the 17th instant.' He warned them that the visit of the guest, which was made for the purpose of renewing an old friendship between the Hashimite and Saudi families, was not to be made the occasion for political manoeuvres.

(V [E 6546/5599/25] Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—[Received Novemher 8.) (No. 290. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, October 15. 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 271, Confidential, of the 1st October, relative to the reactions in this country to the present Italo-Ethiopian situation. I have the honour to report further upon certain more general features of the situation, and to add some details, of minor importance, supplementary to the telegraphic reports submitted since the date of my despatch under reference. 2. I am informed by a fairly reliable source that the consignment of arms and munitions landed here on the 5th October from the Italian steamship Tripolitania, nominally from a firm in Italy to the Italian self-styled merchant Signer Odello, but in reality from the Italian Government to the Saudi Govern ment, reported in my telegrams Nos. 184 and 185, still remains in the Customs Department here. The nine Italian mechanics, or instructors, who arrived from Massawa by the same boat are therefore believed to have at present very little to do. They still live in the Government-owned hotel here. 3. I am reliably informed that the consignment of 150 packages consists of 22 barrels, 1 large case and 127 cases of different sizes. This informant has more recently stated the belief that the large case contains a car, probably an armoured car, but that twenty-two of the smaller packages contain medical stores for the Italian Legation. He added (on the 12th October) that it was reported that a large travelling car, of some well-known Italian make,, luxuriously fitted with dining and sleeping accommodation, with a wireless set, &amp;c., was shortly to arrive here as a present from the Italian Government to Ibn Saud, whilst to-day he reports that an Italian ship, the Ernani, of the Industria Navali Soc. Anon. Linia, is expected to arrive here to-day or to-morrow and to discharge a large truck with trailer, weighing about 10 tons. This, he considers, might be the caravan de luxe for Ibn Saud. Two experts are said to be accompanying the vehicle for the purpose of assembling it on arrival and instructing the eventual driver. 4. Since my despatch No. 232 of the 13th August, when I last referred to the Saudi press and drew attention to the complete silence of the Umm-yl-Qd i a and the Saut-al-Hejaz on the subject of the Italo-Ethiopian crisis, there has been some change. Both organs have appeared with articles on the situation and with copious reproductions of telegraphic reports from various sources on the situation. The articles so far have not been in any way objectionable, and generally, I ''Consider, mav be attributed to the authorship or inspiration o Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. In some instances the news items have contained reports of a probably erroneous and tendentious nature, usually emanating tiom ^ gypt, and quite possibly of original Italian inspiration. For example, the repor o the presence of sixteen Italian submarines in the Red bea was given some prominence, and statements regarding the exodus of residents in gyp o sa ei quarters in Palestine and Syria in fear of the menace of Italian aircraft rom Cyrenaica were reproduced. As reported in my telegram 1 0 - ^ -i u 0 v ai p opportunity on the 6th October of alluding, in conversation with Sheikh Yusui Yasin, to the prevalence of misleading reports, and suggested that the Mecca newspapers would do well to take care to avoid sensational news. 1 he Umm-al-Qura, a newspaper which appears on Friday of each week, now announces that it will publish a daily news-sheet (except Fridays), containing tele^iaph reports of current events. . . ,. ., , ^ 5. No further information has been received regarding the purchase of camels by the Italians. It would appear probable that more information wi .l be available in this respect shortly. Purchases would appear to have been made [556 h—1] U : % •s':almost entirely in Nejd, for not only are reports of purchases m the Hejaz completely lacking, but complaints have been heard locally that Nejd, and not the Heiaz, is reaping the benefits accruing from this deal. The distance to be traversed by the camels in coming from Nejd partly explains the delay in their arrival. My Indian vice-consul also reports that it is believed locally that camels purchased from the northern districts of Nejd will be shipped from Rabigh and Weih and those from the southern districts from ports in Asir such as Jizan and Qunfidha. This may well be the case in order that the movement should be kept as unobtrusive as possible. It may, indeed, be wondered whether the camel of Arabia is likely to be a success in the highlands of Abyssinia, under the rigours of a winter campaign. . 6. The sympathies of the local populace remain as strongly favourable to Abyssinia as before. I am informed that a few days after hostilities had commenced in Kthiopia a crowd collected in Jedda to listen to news broadcast from a wireless set belonging to a certain inhabitant of the town, and that items of news favourable to Ethiopia provoked cheers and cries of ' Down with the Italians! ' from those assembled. It is even asserted that the Italian Charge d'Affaires protested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs against this hostile demonstration as being inconsistent with the friendly relations subsisting between the two countries, Saudi Arabia and Italy. In consequence, it is said, the headmen of the various quarters of the town have received instructions to prevent such demonstrations in future. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Addis Ababa, Aden, the Department of Overseas Trade and the senior naval officer, Red Sea Sloops. I have, &amp;c. A. S.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 30th December, 1935. No. 369 (M 7321/7321/25) /v I Vs Sir, I have received Mr. Calvert's despatch Wo. 338 (2851/135/34) of the 26th November, enclosing a translation of certain new Saudi Regulations regarding the import, sale, carrying and possession of arms in Saudi Arabia. 2. The purpose of these regulations is not easy to estimate. If, as I had hitherto understood, practically all the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia outside the towns and their immediate neighbourhood normally need to carry arms for legitimate purposes such as self-protection from raids from other tribes it would seem that Ibn Baud fey trying, as is apparently his intention, to disarm the entire population may provoke serious tribal unrest. At the same time some doubt is cast on the King's presumable intentions by the terms of Article VII which, indeed, suggests that a large number of licences are, in iact, likely to be issued to official and semi-ofiicial .ersons. 1 observe moreover that Article XVI speaks of 'desert dwellers and others not holding permits 5 ' as though fche;y would still be entitled to carry arms without violating the ntw law. 3./ Andrew Ryan, C.M.G., etc,, etc., etc., J edda.,S£3fcL 3» Article XVlIIj '■/'iiicli provid-es 'tjh.a.'t 'persons froir 'neighbouring countries . 0 . shall deposit their arras with 'the first desert police station in the frontier zone' and that tnese ari-is snail be released when their owners leave Saudi Arabia, vvould seem to apply to migrant tribesmen from Trans j.or dan, Koweit and the Trucial Coast of the Persian Gulf. Read in conjunction with Article XVT, the effect of this provision will apparently be that whereas Saudi tribesmen will only be disarmed when entering towns, foreign tribesmen will at all times be unarmed and at a disadvantage while in Saudi territory. The reaction of such regularly migrant tribes as the Ruwalla may well be most unfavourable. 4, m order to consider what action, if any, His Majesty's Government should take in the interests of the tribes of Transjordan and the Persian Gulf, I shall be glad to have your observations on the above-mentioned aspects of these Regulations, At the same time 1 shall be glad to know what, in your view, is the intended meaning of the words 'evidence 'of nationality if he is subject to the local government', which appear in Article IX. 5.

[E 5403/280/91] Gist of a Report by Mr. Salih J afar Muhammad Salih J afar, M.B.E., British Political Clerk, Hodeida. — {Enclosure to Aden Despatch No. 257 of August 19, 1935; Communicated by Colonial Office, September 7.) . SLAVERY in the Yemen is still existing, and will continue to exist as long as the Yemen is ruled by Arabs and there are chances of imports into the country. 2. There is a demand for slaves in the Yemen, whenever they are available, but the Yemeni buyers are not wealthy, and, consequently, the interest displayed is not so great as in the Hejaz and Nej d. 3. There is no special public market for slaves in the Yemen as at Jeizan and Sabya, and slaves are therefore offered secretly to interested buyers, and when sale is not effected they are transferred from place to place until they reach Asir, where they fetch a better price. 4. It may be questioned as to why slaves are imported into the Yemen when there is a better market in Asir. This is done to avoid detection by the sloops patrolling in the Red Sea, as the Yemen ports are closer to the African smuggling- ports than those of Asir. 5. There are many slaves owned by native Arabs in the Yemen, but as fresh [supplies are rare they are not sold except in an emergency, and therefore command high prices. The King of the Yemen himself and some of his sons are owners of slaves. Some of the old slaves were emancipated by their owners, but are still serving them. 6. Slaves are not usually kept by Yemenis for the purpose of labour. The females serve as concubines, and are sometimes married; and the males are trained to look after the owners' business and house. The chiefs and rulers use certain of their slaves as soldiers. 7. The import of slaves, however, has greatly diminished during the last five years, no doubt owing to the vigilance of the British Red Sea sloops. 8. A further reason for the fall in the imports of slaves in the Yemen may be attributed to the prerogative exercised by Seif-al-Islam Ahmed, the eldest son of the King of the Yemen. Between 1928 and 1930 a large number of slaves were imported into Meidi. The owners and the slaves were ordered to pioceed to Hajja, where Seif-al-Islam Ahmed purchased the best heads at very much reduced prices. The owners sustained great losses, and this greatly discouraged further imports, and since then slaves are secretly smuggled in small numbers as crews, servants, &amp;c., the Yemeni officials being bribed when necessary.

Sir, Jedda, November 6, 1935. 1 HAVE the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper Saut-al-Hejaz, published on the 29th October a short notice that the leading merchants of Jedda had petitioned the King to sanction a tax of a half piastre miri, about Id., on every package imported from abroad into the Hejaz, the proceeds to be in aid of the Falah schools of Jedda and Mecca, which include, besides a boys' school in each town, the girls' school of Jedda. The notice announced that the King's approval had been granted. 2. The Falah schools were founded in 1904 by Haji Muhammad Ali Zainal Ali Ridha (Alireza), at his own expense, except for about 80.000 rupees subscribed in India for the construction of the school building in Jedda. Until 1931 Hajji Muhammad Ali continued to defray all expenses. Both religious and secular teaching is given in these schools, English being on the syllabus. In Mecca, the teaching staff consists of thirty-four, and in Jedda, at the boys' school, of twenty-four. Pupils in Mecca number some 800, and in Jedda, boys only, about 700. Since 1931 the schools have been supported by subscriptions from several local firms and by other charity. It will be remembered that an effort was made during the visit of Talaat Pasha Harb in 1934 to interest him in the girls' school, but with little success. • 3. Owing to the lack of good management and control and also to insufficient funds, the condition of the schools has become so bad. it is said, that the local merchants made an effort to raise a special fund, which amounted to 4,000 rials (about £400), a quarter of which was subscribed once more by the family oi Ali Ridha. This sum being insufficient, the merchants petitioned the King as mentioned above. . i i i i 4. The tax, which will be collected by the shipping agencies and handed over to a special committee of merchants, has already been enforced for some week^ m Jedda, and orders are expected to be sent soon to Yanbu and Kabegn. is method of collection, independent of the Government, is so alien to this coun ry that, in my opinion, it may soon undergo a change. * T ^ 5.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 281 of the 9th October, concerning the activities of the Banque Misr in this country, and more especially their interest in road making, I have the honour to report that the kilometre of asphalt road which it was expected the Banque Misr engineers would lay down as a sample, dwindled in fact to a short stretch of some hundred yards. This was very quickly completed and the Greek engineer left again for Egypt some ten days later. Nothing more having been heard of the Egyptian engineer, it is probable that he also has returned home. 2. The hundred yards of road lies outside the Medina gate of Jedda on ground which, owing to its firmness, one might mistrust as a reliable test for a road which, if and when constructed, will have to pass on its way to Mecca, over hills, wadi beds and shifting sands. No special preparation, as far as could be seen, was given to the foundation, the land merely being levelled and the asphalt laid. As for cost, it is now said that the estimate for laying the whole Mecca-Jedda road is less than the ^45,000 quoted in my despatch under reference, but the exact figure is not known. 3. Talaat Pasha Harb is reported to intend visiting the Hejaz after Ramadan, which ends with the end of December, so the roadway project may then be re-examined and a decision taken whether or not to proceed with the construction of the Mecca road. 4.

[E 7263/132/91 Papers communicated hy the Colonial Office, December 14, 1935. (1) Sir B. Reilly to Sir C. Parkinson. My dear Parkinson, Aden, October 23, 1935. 1 THE following information may be of interest to you in connexion with the present situation here : — Seager (who is at the moment acting as Political Secretary) was visited a few days ago by a Yemeni from Taiz, named Sheikh Saleh Hurub—a close confidant of the'Officer Commanding, Taiz, Seiyid Ali-bin-el-Wazir—-who told him that he had been asked to call on the Italian consul. He asked beager s advice as to whether he should avail himself of this invitation, beager replied that though it was no business of his, he thought Sheikh baleh might get a line on the Italian consul, and that this might be of interest to the lemem ^TwTdays later Saleh Hurub visited Seager in his house and passed on the gist of his conversation with Cavaliere Pasqualucci. This conversation it appears, was in the form of a cross -examination, and the following questions, amongst others, were put, and the answers taken down by the consu s c ei v . {a) Has the Yemeni Government asked the British Government for help. either verbally or in writing ? 11+ ^ (&amp;) Was the British Government paying out any gold to the Yemem^ (c) Was the British Government paying out increased sums of mone} Protectorate tribesmen on the Anglo-Yemeni frontiei (d) Were there any British officers or soldiers in » hei' ^ , fnrtifvinp- of (e) Was it the British Government which had requested the for . g Sheikh Said^ . fovinl?

These developments may tend to accelerate the process of strengthening our ties with the Yemen, and of so bringing it into a British rather than an Italian orbit. I am not disposed to press forward the Anglo-Yemeni rapprochement too rapidly, and at present we at Aden are limiting ourselves to giving the Yemenis good advice when asked for (as, for example, recently about the defences of Sheikh Said), and to cultivating the good neighbourly relations that have existed since the signing of the treaty. On the other hand, if the alarm that now exists in the Yemen with regard to Italian designs against Sheikh Said and the adjacent Yemen coast, including Mocha, continues, it is possible that the King of the Yemen will make further and more direct overtures for British help in fortifying and protecting his coastal districts against Italian intrusion. Should this happen, I shall, of course, report to you officially, and shall not commit myself in any way without instructions. I mention the possibility now, as I should be glad to know your general views with regard to the attitude that we should adopt in the event of Yemeni suggestions for closer co-operation with us, and especially of requests for our help in obtaining armaments. Yours, &amp;c. B. R. REILLY. (2) Mr. Courtney to Sir C. Parkinson. Air Ministry, King sway, Dear Parkinson, N or ember I HE following is an extract from a letter we have received from Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, subsequent to the visit which he paid to Aden towards the end of October :— Fhere is a certain amount of excitement about the Yemen at Aden. As you doubtless know, the Italians have asked the Imam to allow them to send sick and wounded to Mocha. The Imam has so far refused, but he has indicated to Reilly that he would like to know what would be the attitude of Great Britain if the Italians use force. Reilly expects to have a very definite question on this subject sent to him by the Imam in the near future. I don't know what the answer is. We certainly don't want the Italians there, and it would be very awkward if they occupied Sheikh Said, which is the peninsula at the extreme southern end of the Red Sea on the Arabian side. Guns mounted here and at the corner of Eritrea could make exit from the Red bea very uncomfortable. I feel very definitely that we cannot allow them to occupy the southern end of the Yemen at all events.' I am sending a similar letter to Rendel and O'Malley. Yours, &amp;c. C. L. COURTNEY.

A letter has been received by the Resident from the Officer Commanding Taiz, who is at present in Sheikh Said, asking for his assistance in the matter of the supply of guns for the Sheikh Said fort, which is at present being rebuilt. The letter concludes by saying that the Yemeni Government considers the British Government to be its greatest friend and entertains the hope that the desired assistance will be forthcoming. A reply has been sent to the effect that Captain Seager will proceed by air to Am Nabia on the 11th October next to discuss certain points in the letter which require elucidation. The King of the Yemen has been asked at the same time whether he has any objection to the proposed meeting. Captain Seager will take this opportunity to discuss some other ordinary matters with the Officer Commanding Taiz, and he has been instructed not to commit His Majesty's Government in any way to an agreement with the Yemeni request.

Captain Seager proceeded to Am Nabia by air on the 11th October and returned to Aden the same day after discussing matters with the Officer Commanding Taiz, who was in a most amiable mood. Matters of local interest were brought up, while opportunity was found to point out to Seiyid Ali, and he agreed, that it was probable Sheikh Said could be well defended by machine-gun posts and barbed-wire entanglements where guns of a suitable type would be very expensive, difficult to install and eventually require expert handling. (Secret.) Sir (4) Mr. J. H. Thomas to Resident at Aden. Downing Street, December 12, 1935. oir, Downing Street, December 1^, iydo. I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty s Government ha\e had under consideration the attitude which they should adopt (a) in the event of the Italians occupying any point in Yemeni territory, and in particular the territory adjacent to Sheikh Said, either by agreement with the King ot the ^emen or by actual aggression; and (b) in reply to any requests for advice oi material assistance from the King of the Yemen arising out of an Italian aggression against his territory or the threat thereof. . . 2. Any attempt by the Italian Government to occupy any point m iemeni territory, whether by agreement with the King of the l emen or } ac ua aggression, would clearly conflict with the undertaking contained m pom of the conclusions in the agreed record of the Anglo -Italian conversations at , . , . • T T i 1 .L £&lt; TT; , T)-v,i f o Tin i n IVfrnPQt.V S ( rOVftm- 3 conclusions m the aorreed record or tne ^ Rome in 1927, in which it is laid down that ' His Britannic Majesty s Govern_ ■ regard it as a vital imperial interest that no E ';' 0 P ean J; owe ' ,1°', . , )hsh itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea That, on the other hand 11 is in the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast ot Rprl isic»o aVimilrl establish itself on the Arabian ''is in the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast ot he Red Sea, that no European Power should establish itse on e sl »re of the Red Sea ' If Italy were to occupy Sheikh Said or any other P a rt of the Yemeni coast, whether by arrangement with the King o ® t why force of arms, she would therefore have committed a breach of an agieement [581 o—l] B 2 Hh4 entered into with His Majesty's Government. The effect of this would be to ^ ^lus create not a merely local problem but a major Anglo-Italian issue, which would ! f iv d have to be dealt with in the light of the general international situation. &lt; 3 His Majesty's Government have no information which leads them to jfJoTer suppose that Italy, in fact, contemplates any occupation of Yemeni territory. ^ Such evidence as they possess of the views of the Italian Government tends on u m the contrary to show' that they continue to attach particular importance to the preservation of the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. , 4 At the same time rumours have recently been current that His Majesty's ;, Government themselves contemplate the occupation of Sheikh Said. These ^ | rumours are, of course, entirely without foundation, but their existence obliges If, j 1 me to furnish you with certain explanations in regard to the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards this piece of territory, which, as you are aware, - was the subject of special mention in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. Anv occupation of Sheikh Said by His Majesty's Government would be a breach not' only of the engagement which they contracted in 1927 vis-a-vis the Italian (freaim01 Government, but also of the treaty which they concluded with the King of the Yemen in 1934, which provides that the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen shall follow for the first part of its course after leaving the sea the boundary line laid down by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. If doubts are expressed in anv quarter as to the attitude of His Majesty's Govern ment, a reference to the 1934 treaty, with the necessary elucidation of the terms of its third article, should be a sufficient answer. Should, however, the King of the Yemen's fear of an Italian aggression on the Yemeni coast lead him to enquire urgently of you what attitude His Majesty's Government would advise him to adopt in such circumstances, you are authorised to inform him that as a result of an agreement concluded between them some years ago the Italian Govern ment and His Majesty's Government are under a mutual obligation not to establish themselves on the Arabian shore of the Eed Sea. 5. It is understood that requests have been made by the Italian authorities in Eritrea to the King of the Yemen for permission to send sick and wounded soldiers from the Italian forces in Eritrea to the Yemeni coast to recuperate. The King of the Yemen has so far refused permission, but the question may arise again at any moment, and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government consider that it will be well for you to inform the King of the Yemen, should he seek advice in the matter, what is the position in international law. I nder inter national law there is no rule forbidding a neutral Power to allow the entry of the wounded or sick of a belligerent Power into its territory. A neutral Power may grant or refuse such permission, and, in fact, in the past, such permission has in practice been refused more often than granted. If permission is granted, the wounded and sick must remain on the neutral territory and must there be guarded by the neutral Government, and after they have recovered they must be prevented from returning to their home State or rejoining their corps so that they can again take part in the operations of war. While, therefore, the King of the Yemen would be at liberty, under the general principles of international law, to allow wounded and sick from the Italian forces in Eritrea to be brought to the Yemen for recovery, he would be under an obligation to secure that all such wounded and sick remain in the Yemen until the war between Italy and Ethiopia is over. (The view stated above is in accordance with the rules set out in article 59 of Hague Convention No. IV of 1899 and reproduced in identical terms in article 14 of Hague Convention No. V of 1907. The article deals with {a) the transit through, and (h) the maintenance in neutral territory of wounded and wounded prisoners.) 6. Consideration has also been given to the attitude which should be adopted in the event of an application from the King of the Yemen for the supply oi arms or of a request from him for assistance in connexion with the fortification of Sheikh Said. The present position is that the King of the Yemen is at liberty to purchase arms from private firms in this country, and there is no objection m existing circumstances to his continuing to do so. In the event of a request from him for the supply of armaments by His Majesty's Government, you should inform him that it will be necessary to consult His Majesty's Government before an answer is given. On learning from you of any such request. His Majesty s Government will consider the matter in the light of the circumstances prevailing ; at the time. While there might be no objection to the supply of armaments to |the King of the Yemen which would enable him to strengthen his defers provided that surplus stocks were available, you will appreciate that the situation ff0 nld be entirely different if Italy were to commit an act of unprovoked aggression against feneikh ^aid or other parts of the Yemeni coast The sudd I v to the Yemeni Government of arms which would be immediately used asainst Italian troops would raise issues of major importance to Anglo-Italian relations and obviously the most careful consideration in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time would be necessary before any decision could be reached 7. In the event of a request by the King of the Yemen for advice as to the : method of fortifying the Yemeni coast, His Majesty's Government see no objection to gi\ing further advice such as has already been given by Captain : : Seager to the local Yemeni authorities if they ask for it. They consider it important, however, that nothing should be said to the King or the Yemeni authorities which would in any way give the impression that His Majesty's Government were accepting any responsibility for the defences of the Yemen or that they were anxious to see those defences strengthened I have, &amp;c.

Sir, Jedda, November 2$, WITH reference to my despatch No. 277 of the 8th October, relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to inform you that the operations of this concern appear to be making steady progress. Mr. Twitchell recently informed me that diamond-drilling, carried out by six Swedish employees of the syndicate, was now proceeding night and day, and that a depth of some 80 feet had been attained. 2. Since my despatch under reference the personnel of the syndicate has been further increased by the arrival of two British employees, Messrs. Dunckley and McDermott, the former as manager of the Jedda office and the latter, a son of a director of the syndicate, as a surveyor; of two Americans, one Dutchman, one German and one Greek. Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer on the Jedda staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), also has now taken up a similar post under the syndicate. 3. A large quantity of stores, vehicles and machinery, including the diamond drills, have arrived since my despatch under reference, and a great proportion has been successfully transported to the mine, in spite of difficulties over one stretch of the road Jedda-Asfan-al-Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab, on which work is still proceeding. 4. Work is also going on in the construction of houses, built of local stone, at the mine, whilst at Jedda it is reliably stated that the syndicate have acquired an area of some 300 or 400 yards square, about 1 mile north of the town close to the shore, where it is proposed to erect houses for the staff, workshops, store rooms and garages, and it is also projected in due course to construct a pier out to deep water to facilitate the loading and unloading of their materials. 5. According to revised estimates, I should now be disposed to place the mine at roughly 23° 30' N. by 41° E. An unconfirmed statement has reached me that an area of 1 square mile has been granted by the syndicate to a company, perhaps a subsidiary company, formed to prospect and exploit that area. 6.

IN my telegram No. 217 of the 8tb December, I had the honour to report the results of the action taken by me in Riyadh on your despatch No 311 of the 24th October regarding the question of slavery in Saudi Arabia. I have nothing to add to what I stated m that telegram, except that I satisfied myself that it would be useless to press Fuad Bey further on the three points which I was unable to settle with him. I understood him to say that, if we agreed to the Saudi slavery regulations as drafted, with the slight further modifications now agreed on, Ibn Saud would be prepared to promulgate them in return for a promise by His Majesty's Government to renounce their right of manumission after a short interval. 2. I dealt with the question of slavery, as in earlier discussions, as the most important of the matters connected with the proposed prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. In this connexion I would offer the following observations on paragraphs 12 to 14 of your despatch No. 311 of the 24th October. Fuad Bey made no reference at Riyadh to the possibility of a new general treaty between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. The conditions foreshadowed in paragraph 13 of your despatch, as those in which the conclusion of such a treaty might be possible, have certainly not arisen. On the other hand, I see no reason why the alternative course of prolonging the validity of the present treaty should not still be pursued, despite the failure which has attended my efforts to secure a settlement of the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers and the uncertain future of other questions not discussed at Riyadh, notably that of air facilities, which I preferred to postpone, and that of the Transjordan frontier, one in which it is for the Saudi Government to make the next move. I have throughout been averse from the alternative discussed in paragraph 14 of your despatch, if it can be avoided. In these circumstances I should prefer, subject to your approval, to proceed still on the lines of the second sentence of para graph 12 of your despatch, that is to say to dispose of the question of slavery, if this is possible, and then to proceed with the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda by an exchange of notes, dealing only with the right of manumission. Arms Traffic and the language of the treaty. 3. As I am not yet in a position to report any further discussion oi importance regarding the last two subjects that 1 have mentioned, I can most conveniently record the position in regard to them in this despatch : («) In the course of the conversations at Riyadh I gave Fuad Bey the text of the Arms Traffic formula proposed in paragraph 7 of your despatcn No. 321 of the 6th November. Fuad Bey did not seem to like it very much, but we did not discuss it systematically and I propose, m accordance with paragraph 8 of that despatch, to postpone sue discussion, if possible, until we have got further with slavei v. ^ (b) As regards the language of the treaty, I told Fuad Bey in e coul ' s ® our general conversations that I thought His Majesty s . me11 . . would be prepared to give the Saudi Government satis ac ^ 10n 0 , point, but that it was so subsidiary to the lssues ^ ^ th ascertained the general views of His Majesty s J ° ve11111 ? , ^ subject only just before leaving England and ha no • instructions.

I made it clear to Fuad Bey that, if we got to the point of drafting an exchange of notes providing for the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, the draft notes would have to be submitted for your approval. 5. I would draw attention to one other point. In paragraph 12 of your despatch No. 311 you speak of a prolongation ' for a period of, say, seven years.' You will remember that at the sixth meeting with Fuad Bey in London^) Fuad Bey suggested an alternative, viz., prolongation of ten years unless a new treaty should be negotiated in the meanwhile. I should myself prefer, on the whole, a prolongation for seven years, but I should be glad to know whether, if Fuad Bey renews his alternative suggestion in due course, I may accept it.

[E 7475/1012/25] Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 23.) (No. 344. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, November 30, 1935. IN my despatch No. 370 of the 11th December, 1934, I had the honour to submit a brief review of the general financial and economic situation in Saudi Arabia. I now propose, after an interval of almost twelve months, to attempt a similar appreciation, necessarily as brief and perhaps as fragmentary as in previous years, in view of the absence of reliable statistics and the lack of authoritative sources of information. 2. Whilst during the previous twelve months Saudi finances were heavily engaged in meeting and satisfying the demands of the Saudi-Yemen War and its settlement, the period under review may be held to have witnessed the liquida tion of the immediate legacies of the conflict and a renewal of the activities of the Minister of Finance, now less preoccupied with the duties of his second office of Deputy Minister of Defence, to find fresh sources of revenue to repair the seriously deplenished financial resources of the State. 3. Some relief was afforded early in the year by a further increase in the number of foreign pilgrims performing the Hajj in 1935. Not only did this figure increase from 25,291 in 1934 to 33,898, but an exceptional number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims visited the Hejaz this year,, a matter of some point when the general level of wealth amongst incoming pilgrims has fallen so markedly in these lean years. Ihe beneficent eiiects o^ the increase brought comfort to all classes in the Hejaz, but complaints weie no wanting that the Government had appropriated to themselves the lions siaie of the pilgrimage harvest, and distress, even amongst merchants, mo oi-cai proprietors and pilgrim guides, all of whom might have been expec e o aye benefited most by a larger pilgrimage, was only partially allevia e . ei a foreign companies in Jedda, however, had a more satisfac ory ,J ea ^' completing their accounts after the Hajj, both Messrs.

General trading conditions may be said to have shown some improvement ' ^ during the period under review. Chiefly owing to the larger pilgrimage, there # J have been increased clearances through customs and a somewhat better tone in 0 the market. This, unfortunately, does not mean that conditions can be described as satisfactory, but the tendency is encouraging. Protests were again evoked during the year by the practice of the Government of importing goods, iW 111116 particularly rice, through one importing firm. Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza Jp 11 ^ e( - and Co., to the detriment of others, with the result that some small redistribution if W of favours was effected to soothe the malcontents. The system adopted by the I® 56 Saudi Arab Government of settling their local indebtedness by allowing rebates d ^ of customs dues on goods imported was maintained through the year, although rrf in its early months the Government appeared disposed to abandon it. Adverse comment, and perhaps a realisation of the convenience of the system to the authorities themselves, led to a continuance of this practice. From one source it is gathered that the total number of packages to enter through the port of Jedda during the past twelve months was 620,000, of which some 120,000 were for the Saudi Arab Government or foreign diplomatic missions, and hence duty free. 6. Expoi'ts continued to be negligible (they were estimated in March last, for the previous twelve months, at about £8,000 gold), but may be expected during recent days to have received a fillip from the reported purchase of camels from this country by the Italians for purposes connected with the war in Abyssinia, a subject on which separate reports have been submitted. About 1,000 camels are said to have been shipped from Yanbu, though confirmation is still awaited, and the price paid is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of £15 gold per camel. 7. The visible adverse balance of trade is therefore heavy and has been estimated locally by a confidential, but well-informed, source as about £1,261,000 gold for the year 1351 A.H. and £981,000 gold for 1352 A.H. 8. Economy has again been rigidly practised, except perhaps in certain items of Royal expenditure, and once more at the expense of Government officials, whose salaries, when paid, were invariably in arrear, whilst in the early summer steps were taken to effect an all-round salary reduction of 25 per cent., two-thirds of the now reduced salary to be paid in cash and one-third in kind, the cash payment to be reckoned in gold at a rate highly unfavourable to the official. . 9. Apart from the system of customs drafts, described above, the Saudi Government are believed to have been able to meet current liabilities. One signal instance, either of a recognition of the advantages to be derived from a settlement of debts or of a desire to please, may be recorded when, in May 1935, they repaid the whole of one small debt due to His Majesty's Government and 10 per cent, of a larger one due to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. 10. Little or no additional taxation has been imposed during the past twelve months, except in the case of certain minor matters, such as the imposition of an annual tax of £2 gold on wireless receiving sets, permission to import and use which, restricted to certain towns of the Hejaz, was one of the notable concessions to Western influences of the year. 11. The history of the period under review as regards currency has been more eventful than in past years. A shortage of silver rials, probably in some measure due to hoarding, made itself felt during the summer, when rates per £ gold showed the following sharp movements :— April 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... 21 June 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... 20 July 1 17 18 July 11 14^ July 31 16 -8 August 17-6 September ... ... ... ... ... 18^ A further unusual feature was the importation through Jedda from India by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza, for the account of the Saudi Arab Government, between May and November inclusive, of 1,630,000 rupees; and a further consign ment of 400,000 rupees is shortly expected. The reason advanced is that the rupee is a more convenient coin for use in Nejd than the Maria Theresa dollar, .and a more popular one with the tribes than the Saudi rial.■ K 1 12.

Ryan (Jedda). (No. 7.) Foreign Office, January 4, 1936. IN proposing the formal prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 the Saudi Government have raised, among other points, the question of amending article 10 of the present treaty with a view to establishing the completely equal status of the English and Arabic versions of the text. This article at present runs as follows :— ' The present treaty has been drawn up in English and Arabic. Both texts shall be of equal validity; but in case of divergence in the interpreta tion of any part of the treaty' the English text shall prevail.' 2. The draft note to prolong the Treaty of Jedda which the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to you for consideration on the 30th March last (a copy of which was enclosed in your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April) contained the following paragraph :— ' (6) The text of article 10 of the Treaty of Jedda, providing that the English text shall prevail in case of divergence, does not imply discrimina tion between the Arabic and English languages, the equal validity of which is established by the said article, but is a matter of scientific facility when it may be necessary for authorised persons to make comparison between the texts. I therefore wish to receive from your Excellency confirmation of the fact that the Arabic and English texts are of equal validity in sense and in interpretation, and that neither of the two texts has preference over the other.' The comment on this proposal in your covering despatch was that, while Fuad Bey's actual formula seemed unduly complicated, you considered that the principle of full equality between the two languages might well be accepted by His Majesty's Government in deference to the strong motive oi amour-jyroyre and national sentiment which animated the Saudi Government in the matter. You recalled that other Powers, such as France and Italy, had accepted the full equal validity of the Arabic version of their treaty with feaudi Arabia, whereas His Majesty's Government had even gone so far as to admit the sole validity of the Arabic text of the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of 1934 (although, as was explained to Fuad Bey, this had only been conceded in view of the very special and primitive circumstances prevailing in the Yemen, where there was no official with a proper knowledge of English). „ 1 3. You will recollect that an allusion to the question ot language was subsequently made in the course of the general discussion on the arrangements for renewing the Treaty of Jedda at the fourth meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on the 5th July last.(') Fuad Bey was inclined on that occasion to try to make capital out of the example of the Anglo-lemeni I 1 eat} , but Mr. Rendel informed him of the very special circumstances existing m a case and made it clear that it could in no circumstances be regarded as a precedent. Mr. Rendel added that the amendment of the present language ot article 10 was mainly a formal and technical point on which the competent authorities would have to be consulted in due course. . /? u • i 4. The general practice of His Majesty's Government (following a rule laid down by Mr. Canning and Lord Palmerston) has always been that hilateial treaties should be in two texts, viz., in English and in the language of the other f 1 ) Foreign Office Print, ' Eastern (Arabia),' July 5, Section 1. [606 d—11 ' u | mrnsmi2 contracting party, except in the rare cases where the other contracting party assented to the use of English alone. Further, the two texts were to be regarded as of equal validity. In the case of treaties with Arab States, however, the practice in the past has normally been to have both English and Arabic texts, with the English text prevailing in case of divergence. It was therefore in accordance with precedent that it was provided in article 10 of the Treaty of Jedda that in case of doubt as to the interpretation of the treaty the English text should prevail. At the same time the attempt was made to soften this apparent discrimination against Arabic by providing that ' both texts shall be of equal validity . . . .,' with the result that, although it cannot be doubted that the English text should prevail in case of a divergence of opinion, the phraseology of article 10 is to some extent contradictory. 5. I consider that in modern conditions it is no longer practicable in all cases to insist upon the rule formerly observed with Arab States. In recent years relatively large and important independent Arab States have arisen, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which must be treated in the matter of the language of treaties on an equal footing with other independent sovereign States. A precedent has already been established in this sense in the case of the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, which does not provide for either language prevailing iii case of doubt, but lays it down that any dispute as to interpretation is to be dealt with by negotiation or through the League of Nations. 6. I accordingly authorise you to inform the Saudi Government that His Majesty's Government are prepared to accede to their desire to secure equality for the Arabic version of the Treaty of Jedda. and to provide, in any eventual exchange of notes formally prolonging the treaty, for the necessary amendment of the existing article 10. You should add, however, that His Majesty's Government consider that this amendment can most conveniently and accurately be made not by adopting the formula proposed in the draft note communicated by Euad Bey on the 30th March, but by providing for the deletion of the words after the semicolon in the second sentence of article 10, so as to leave the operative portion of the article to run as follows without any risk of ambiguity ;— ' The present treaty has been drawn up in English and Arabic. Both texts shall be of equal validity.' I consider that this modification could best be effected by means of an explanatory paragraph in the eventual exchange of notes prolonging the Treaty of Jedda, which would put on record the agreed amendment and set out the revised wording of the article. 7. In view of the fact that (as you yourself reported in your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April) there has hitherto been no dispute over the interpre tation of the actual wording of the treaty, I consider that it would be both unnecessary and undesirable to embark on a possibly difficult attempt to find a formula providing for any such dispute to be settled by arbitration or any other means. You should therefore avoid raising on your account the question of the inclusion of any provision of this nature. I am, &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN.■ '■ * I / i 0 I Confident ial . P .O.No. 175 -S of 1956.

Item 1.— Examination of the Degree of Reconditioning which the Railway requires. The Conference considered that the line should be repaired to the minimum 'compatible with safety, bearing in mind the regular running of one train a week and additional trains when required, especially during the five months of the heavier traffic. Ft was considered that this minimum reconditioning should include the reconstruction of bridges but it should eliminate all stations except those required for water, engine changing and train crossing purposes. Item 2.— Preparation of an Estimate of the Cost of the Necessary Work. The approximate estimates of reconstruction in the degree recommended under Item 1 are £P. 35,000 for the Maan-Mudawara section and £P. 125,000 for the Mudawara-Medina section. To these figures should be added 20 per cent, for the transport of materials and contingent and unforeseen expenditure, giving figures of £P. 42,000 and £P. 150,000 or a total for the whole work of £P. 192,000. The conference emphasised that this estimate was based on present conditions and information and should only be considered as approximate. Item 3.— Establishment of the Manner in which the Necessary Expense is to he met While recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the sections damaged should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circumstances, the conference could only commend the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned. (La conference ne pent que laisser aux Gouvernements interesses le soin de poursuivre Faboutissement de cette question.) Item 4.— Consideration of a Project for the Organisation of a Train Service along the whole length of the Railway. The conference considered that in the first place it would be sufficient to arrange for one mixed train a week in each direction between Maan and Medina, this train to connect with existing services on the Hejaz Railway in Transjordan, Syria and Palestine. Additional trains to be arranged as required in the five months of Rajab, Ramadan and the Pilgrimage. Item 5.— Consideration of a Project for the eventual Distribution of Rolling- Stock among the different Sections of the Line. The conference considered that, as in the division of stock between the Syrian, Transjordan and Palestine sections of the railway in 1926, the stock on the whole railway according to the last inventory before the 30th October, 1918, should be distributed in accordance with article 108 of the Treaty of Lausanne 1923, namely, on the length of track and the nature and amount of the traffic as represented by the train kilometrage on each section operated in August 1914.THIS DOCUMEMT IS PROPER] y of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT U ' EASTEKN (A rabia ).

WITH reference to Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 339 of the 26th November. I have the honour to state that, in view of the great development of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) during my absence from Jedda last year, I requested Mr. Calvert to prepare a general memorandum on the position reached by the end of 1935. Although this memorandum includes certain information which has already been reported to your Department, it adds a good deal that has come to the knowledge of the Legation since the date of the despatch under reference and gives a useful comprehensive picture of what has become the most important industrial enterprise in the west of Saudi Arabia. I therefore enclose a copy of it. 2. Most of the information collected by Mr. Calvert is fairly generally known here, but I would ask that section (c) should be regarded as confidential, especially as the map mentioned in the third sentence was shown privately to the member of my staff concerned by a subordinate employee of the syndicate, who thought afterwards that he had committed an indiscretion. The Legation has to reckon with the fact that Mr. Twitchell, the general manager, is a somewhat secretive person, who might easily make it more difficult to obtain information, if he thought it were likely to be made public. 3. Work on the road from Jedda to the Mahd is still in progress, and 1 understand that as far as approximately 72 miles from Jedda the road may be described, from the point of view of light motor transport, as good. The central portion of the total distance still presents difficulty, but the syndicate are now equipped with modern road-making machinery. Activity also continues at the Jedda ' terminalof the road, where the construction of the compound referred to in paragraph 4 of the despatch under reference, on an area now stated to be 300 by 150 yards, is proceeding steadily. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for JTransjordan. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. S ection 2. Enclosure. Memorandum respecting the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, {Limited), Mining Concession. (Confidential.) (a) Areas being worked, or about to be wo THE operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate comraenced m March 1935 at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab (position according to latest estimates at 23 degrees 30 minutes north by 41 degrees east) and near Yaxibu q workings, where Mr. Shanks was engaged, were abandoned m th .® ear '&gt; but the former have continued and have been developed wi 1 ^ r0 Tn t dl ? f thTterms of the original concession reported to Fo ' ei ^ i °if^ 5 s Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 56 of the 24th February 193 ^. ^ a^a 8 which it is desired to prospect further should be designa at ,; omtulllles areas for exploitation must be fixed and subsidiary exp [631 c—2]formed within two years of the date of the concession, it is becoming a matter of urgency to determine the areas which can be worked profitably. Mr. Shanks has been away prospecting for the past two months or more (he returned on the 21st December, 1935), but had not had much success. His prospecting trip is believed to have taken him in an easterly and north-easterly direction, well into Nejd, almost but not quite as far as the Jebel Hilit (see below). At the end of 1935 arrangements were stated to be under way for four separate prospecting parties to go out into the concessionary area, the districts to be explored being, it is said, Yanbu' (in spite of previous failure in that neighbour hood). Wejh and two others not at present definitely known. M. Van de Poll left for Wejh about the end of December in this connexion. (b) Facts known as regards handing over the Mahd to an Exploitation Company, The little we know on this subject may be summarised as follows. The first mention, I believe, was by a member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to a member of the Legation early in August, 1935. This was reported to the Foreign Office in our despatch No. 227 of the 6th August, 1935. Towards the end of October, 1935, another member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate stated that the syndicate had given 'the new company' one square mile to survey, a conversation which was reported in our despatch No. 339 of the 26th November, 1935, paragraph 5. It is difficult to determine from these brief references whether the Mahd itself is to be turned over to the subsidiary (it seems most probable), or whether an adjacent area is being made over to it, or both. (c) Facts known or surmised regarding Difficulties with the Saudi Arab Government. Difficulties are believed to have arisen with the Saudi Arab Government over the definition of the boundaries to the original concession. These boundaries are given at paragraph 2 of the enclosure to Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch to the Foreign Office No. 56 of the 24th February, 1935, and were published in the Urnm-al-Qura of the 12th February, 1935. In December 1935 a member of the Legation staff had access for a short time to a map in possession of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, on which a boundary line was traced. This was observed to run as follows : Birk-Raghdan—Barq Samuda (not on Hunter's map, but about 21 degrees 30 minutes by 41 degrees 30 minutes)-Ashaira-Marran- Iqbah-Point 7 miles east of Mahd-adh-Dhahab-Amaq-Hanakiya-Hadiya-2500 mark of Hunter's map on Transjordan frontier near Itraif, thence along the de facto Hejaz-Transjordan frontier to Aqaba. The difference between this alignment and the published version relates principally to the area in the neigh bourhood of the Mahd. It would appear that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate are likely to lose, owing to miscalculation of the position of the Mahd and/or Jureysiya, a considerable slice of territory. The extent of this loss is not altogether clear although it probably forms a salient into the concessionary area, but whether of 7 miles depth or a larger area, due to an important inaccuracy in fixing the position of the Mahd, is not apparent. This is, of course, the main difficulty. Related to it, and indeed. perhaps part of it, is the difficulty recorded in my minute of the 21st December, 1935, where it is described how Mr. Shanks was not permitted by an obstructive Amir of Medina to prospect as far east as the Jebel Hilit, an area, however, I should have thought would under any interpretation be well outside the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate concession. Minor difficulties have been experienced and smoothed away, e.q., over employing Nejdi as well as Hejazi labour. (d) New Recruits, with general Idea of Distribution. Staff arrivals and departures have been recorded pretty faithfully in our despatches to the Foreign Office. Since the last -one' (No. 339' of the 26th November, 1935), the following have arrived :— S. C. Bullock—(British), arrived December 21, 1935. J. Walker—(American), arrived December 15, 1935. ?

WiITH reference to my telegram No. 12 of the 27th January last and to previous correspondence on the subject of the possible admission of Saudi Arabia to membership of the League of Nations, I transmit to you the accompanying six copies of the amended text of the Covenant of the League, together with a specimen of the usual questionnaire (as used in the case of the application of Afghanistan) on the basis of which the Sixth Committee of the League considers and reports on application for membership^ 1 ) 2. The question of the possible admission of Saudi Arabia to membership of the League has received further careful consideration in the light of the arguments advanced in your telegram No. 4 of the 3rd January last, but, as stated in my telegram under reference, the opinion of His Majesty's Government on this question remains unchanged. The example of Abyssinia has demonstrated the potential embarrassment to the League of having backward and undeveloped countries as members, and from the point of view of the League itself it is clear that the admission of Saudi Arabia would, in present circumstances, be of ver\ doubtful advantage. . . 3. While it cannot be doubted that a settlement of the question ot the South-East Arabian frontier and the enactment by King Ibn baud of satisfactoi v slavery legislation would greatly facilitate the candidature of Saudi Aiabia, there would be grave obiections to any attempt to link up the enquiiy oi Fua e\ Hamza reported in your telegram No. 3 of the 3rd January with the ( esic ei a a of His Majesty's Government in the matter of the frontiers or m that oi slavery.
