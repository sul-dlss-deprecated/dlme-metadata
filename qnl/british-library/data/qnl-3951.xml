As you probably knov7 p had you been accepted, it was our intention to send you back to the Persian Gulf as Political # g nt at i ahrsin. &gt; Finding a good man for this post resenta ua with rather a problem end the purpose of th a letter is to ask whether you would &gt;e trilling to accept a contract eppointnent to the post on t o terras outlined in In&lt;-io Office telegrams Hos.9123 and 9340 to the Political Reoidont, with which I believe you are familiar, that is to say, a salary of £13S0, language allowance &lt;^90 per axmura (both taxable) end s ersonel allcraroncc of fl7. r X) per annum (non taxable). The appointment wild be for e period of 16 nontha or 3 years, whichever is the nore convenient.

C.J.Pelly, Esq. ,0.B.S., 5 Merlyn Park, Balisoridge, Dxiblin, Eire. (H.T.Kennedy.)posts is becoming somewhat serious. Officers for the posts of:- t 'l) Assistant Political Agent Bahrein. 2) Assistant „ olitical Agent l uscat. 3^ Secrets.ry to the political Resident. 4) Political Agent 'Mirein have still to be found. Mr. Jackson 1 s'posting to Bahrein is a temporary arrangement until a more senior officer is available. On relief Lr. Jackson is to take over as political Officer in the Trucial Coast. 3y far the most important of these posts is, of course, that of Political Agent, aiirein, and it was assumed that in view of his past record, his qualifications and his experience, r. Pelly was ^ if airly certain of selection to the Foreign Service * Mnd so would be available for the Bahrein Agency. We now learn that he has not been accepted for Foreign - Service and he has informed me that at most he would ’ only be willing to accept a short teim contract of not lore tiian six months as a stop gap arrangement. The loss of ; r. relly would be serious in that we have no one in mind who possesses the necessary experience and language qualifications who could fill the post. Apparently the Foreign Office are also unable to help. Mr. Pelly himself is convinced that he has been the victim of circumstances and that had he been permitted to appear before the Civil Service Commission when/- / ■ ■ VAion the first, selections for officers for the Gulf ircre made he vrould liave stood a much better chance. There is perhaps some justification for this view though it is hardly one which can be ut to the Civil Ser\^ice Comission. I suggest therefore tiiat the h.iportance of retaining Felly’s services is sufficient to justify an approach to the Foreign Office with a view to attempting to secure a review of the case. A draft which it is proposed to submit to r. Donaldson on his return is placed below and I should be grateful for your comments.p DPuAl'TT L2T1CER [•A.Oaccia, Esc., C.M.G., Lgn.

As he is obviously reluctant to accept temporary employment, and Sir R.
