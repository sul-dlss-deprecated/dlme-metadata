Subsequent correspondence dated 1910, exchanged between Sir Louis Du Pan Mallet of the Foreign Office, and India Office officials, casts doubt on aspects of the case, and also questions whether any action can be taken on the El Katr [Qatar] coast, over which the Ottoman Porte claims sovereignty.Correspondence relating to a second, similar incident at Fuwairah in 1912, includes renewed discussion of what action should be taken with regard to incidents of ‘piracy’ on the Qatar coast, with a copy of a letter addressed to Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thāni [Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī] by the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer) (ff 4-5).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Fuwairat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Law of the sea</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipwrecks</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fines (penalties)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
