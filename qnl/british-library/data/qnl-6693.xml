I he answers to the above questions are to some extent embodied in the note which I have written giving a statement of the case and my own views on the boundary question, but I will now reply to the questions categorically, as far as I am able. I. M hat date do you fix as the date determining the relative positions of the Turks and Amiris in the plateau? Is the status of the year so fixed shown in any map? I am of opinion that the limits of the territory of the Amir of Dthali should be determined by the status of the year 1.870, before the commencement of Turkish aggression. I consider that for practical purposes the red line in the map accompanying Colonel Wahab’s letter of 7th April P.,02 maybe taken as indicating the Political,, status. ^ 28/02. II. Trace approximately the line of frontier as fixed above. The country has not yet been completely surveyed, but the line includes the valley of the Tiban from about Jabal Warwa to where the stream issues from the Lthali plateau at the northern end of Jabal Jahaf. It then crosses the plateau in an easterly and north-easterly direction, giving Sanah and Lakmat-as-Shiub (and possibly A1 Elakl) to the Amir. III. Can you name the places or posts now occupied by the Turks, or the Amiris, on the other side of their respective frontiers, which must be evacuated as encroachments ? IV. Can you give the dates and circumstances of such encroachments ? The Turks have for a long time occupied Jaleli, a place only 2J miles from Lthali, with a detachment of troops. This occupation is not only in contra vention of the assurances given to Lord Derby in 1874, but in direct disobedience of the orders actually transmitted by the Porte to the local officials. I believe the Turkish post was established at Jaleli in 1890 or 1891, just at the time that Wahab’s survey of the country was commencing. That it was not protested against is partly accounted ior by the tact that the Amir’s complaints were withheld by Muhammad Saleh Jafir. The hill Jabal Shahad (or Suheb), about half a mile south-east of Jaleli, was occupied by troops in the autumn of 1901, shortly before Major Davies’ visit to Dthali. It is said to have been since strengthened with field works, on which at least one gun is mounted. S. 28. a11 During the present year, that is since demarcation was agreed to, the Turks have established posts of regular troops at Mafari and at Sarir, the latter being one of the Jabal Jahaf villages. The former was occupied soon after the arrival of the British Commission, that is in February 1902, and the latter a little later, in March. Besides these posts, the Turks have established posts of Arab levies at Itobat and other places, forming a cordon across the southern end of the plateau.* The line runs in a general * See para, -o ± o e. east and west direction, between Dthali and Jaleli. Everything on their side of this line is treated by the Turks as annexed territory. All the places named, with the exception of Jaleli, are within the line which His Majesty’s Government are so far prepared to adopt, [t is obvious that these are encroachments, and should be evacuated. In my opinion, the Turkish troops and officials should also be withdrawn from Jaieli, and from every part of the Dthali plateau and tracts adjacent to it, before the demarcation of this part of the frontier is commenced. There have been no encroachments on the part of the Amiris. The Amirs of Dthali have had, since 1880, sufficient occupation in ende ivouring to rescue their own country from the clutches of the Turks, and have certainly had no opportunity of extending their limits in any way which can be considered encroachment on Turkish territory. But it has no doubt happened that the wave of Turkish aggression has at times gone forward and then again receded. Villages have paid revenue to the Turks under compulsion, but have returned to the Amir when the pressure was removed. Having regard to the peculiar views held bv the Turks on the subject of their rights in Southern Arabia, I think it is possible that the recovery by the Amir of his own villages may be regarded by them as “ encroachment.” But that there should have been encroachment* in the ordinary sense of the word, by the Amiris on the Turks, appears to me to be absurd. I Political, 1445a/01. I should like to add a few words of personal explanation It has struck me that Colonel Wahab’s statements and opinions have been occasionally confused with my own. Colonel Wahab is His Majesty’s Commissioner, and I was bound to forward his letters and telegrams. Sometimes I have added a few remarks of my own, usually expressive of concurrence. At others, when not altogether agreeing with his views, I have transmitted the papers without remark. For instance, Colonel Wahab, while freely admitting that the list of villages in his report of 1892 does not in the least accord with the facts of the present day, and while placing the responsibility ior that list, and the line marked in his tracing, on the “ Aden Besidency,” would be glad to show that the information was fairly correct at the time it was submitted. In other words, his view is that the Amir has bettered his position since 1892. This is not impossible, hut I do not take, and never have taken, this view. I believe, and I think Colonel Abud agrees with me. that the line indicated in 1892 was practically the product of Muhammad Saleh Jaffir’s ill will to the Amir, and that it should, if possible, be altogether rejected. Further, with regard to the Vote forwarded to the Government of Bombay uith iny letter of 12th October 1901.

It was therein declared that Great Britain will not permit any interference on the part of Turkish officials with the Stipendary Chiefs, the “Sultans of Lahedj and Dhali, Alowee and Jiaushabee, being specially mentioned. H.C., 5601/74. 2 It will be remembered that this declaration was called forth by the continued interference of the Turkish officials in Yemen with the tribes and Chiefs who had relations with the Aden Residency. The Porte put forward clanns to the whole of Arabia, whereupon Her Majesty’s Government pointed out (Lord Granville s Despatches of 30th January and 15th May 1873) 2 974/73. ^ i ^ t 200 y ears &gt; Yem en had been under the rule of independent 3995/73. Arab vAuefs, adding that it was the wish of Her Majesty’s Government that the independence of those Chiefs in the vicinity of Aden should be respected ; and that they could not view with indifference any attempt to subvert their authoiity. ^sinii tribes were named with whom treaty engagements had been entered into without reference to the Porte, and it was stated that the British Government felt free to make fresh engagements if they thought it expedient. J These nine tribes were :— 1. The Abdali. 2. The Padthli. 3. The Akrabi. 4. The Haushabi. 5. The Alawi. 6. The Ameer {sic). 7. The Subaihi. 8. The Yaffai. 9. The Aulaki. 3. It ma} be w r ell to note that while at this time we had engagements with the above tribes, we had not protective treaties with any one of them. The first protective treaties were not made till a much later date (1888), and such treaties have only been concluded with a few' of the nine tribes! Some of the nearest and most important of our stipendaries, e.g., the Sultan of Lahej, have no protective treaties. The Despatch from the Government of India naming the tribes, distinctly states that treaties had been concluded with all of them, but, as a matter of fact, no separate treaty had at that time been entered into with Secref’of the Amir of Dthali. The Amiri are, however, included in the agreement i it^April entered into with the Sultan of Lahej, formerly of Aden, six months after 1873. the capture of the place, in wdiich the British Government undertook to pay the stipend hitherto paid by the Sultan to the Fadhli, Yaffai, Haushabi, and “Ameer” tribes. The Amir of Dthali has consequently been a stipendary of the British from the first. This appears to be a point of some importance. 4. The result of Lord Granville’s Despatch was that orders were sent by the Ottoman Government to the Governor-General of Yemen, directing him to abstain from all interference with the independent tribes, and holding him S. 28. A2 Enclosure in Bombay Letter, IS'o. 32, dated 26th June 1880. Aden Letter, No. 33/589, 20th May 1873. responsible for any hostile proceedings against them. These orders were, doubtless, very distasteful to the local authorities, who then commenced the course of' resistance to the central authority, and accusations of “ encroach ment ” on the partlof the Chiefs having relations with the British Government, which has been continued to the present day. It was only after repeated remonstrances, and the despatch of a British force to Lahej, that the Turkish troops and officials were withdrawn from the territories of the Ahdali and Haushabi tribes. 5. At the same time the British Ambassador at Constantinople extracted from the Turkish Government a distinct assurance that the orders trans mitted to the authorities in Yemen applied to the country of the whole of the Chiefs having treaty relations with Great Britain, a list of which had been furnished to the Porte. This was the general situation at the end of 1873. 6. The district of Dthali and its dependencies, constituting the “Ameer,” or Amiri, territory, lies almost immediately to the north of the country of the Haushabis, the very small tract occupied by the Alawi tribe alone intervening. It had therefore naturally been overrun by the Turks when they advanced into the Haushabi country, and to Lahej, and their with drawal from Haushabi and Ahdali territory should have been followed, according to the assurances of the Porte, by the evacuation of the Amiri country also. The Amir of Dthali at that time was Ali bin Mokhbil, a young man who had succeeded to the chiefship in 1872. He had been duly recognised by the British Government, and the stipend paid to his predecessors had been continued to him. Unfortunately for himself he had been fricrhtened into giving in his submission to the Porte ; although, according t;&gt; Colonel Hunter, he had at the same time expressed to the Resident at Aden his desire to adhere to his stipendiary engagement with the British. In May 1873 General Schneider reported that Ali bin Mokhbil had visited Aden to explain the situation. He was told that a friendly understanding existed between the British and Turkish Governments, and given the usual advice to abstain from the commission of any acts likely to annoy the Turks. Enclosure in Boml *ay Political Letter, No. 32, dated 26th June 1880. H.C., 5443/74. 5552/74. 7. Ali bin Mokhbil returned to his country, and was promptly imprisoned by the Turkish Kaimmukam of Kataba, his uncle Muhammad Musaid being appointed Mudir of the Dthali district in his place. “ Strong diplomatic “ representations were made to induce the Porte to release Ali bin Mokhbil, “ and he was freed in January 1871 ” (Hunter), after about six months’ detention, but the local Turkish officials continued to support Muhammad Musaid. 8. Ali bin Mokhbil applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance, and in consequence our representative at Constantinople was directed by Lord Derby (Despatch dated 16th March 1871) to request the Porte to instruct the Turkish authorities in Yemen “ to desist from interference in the affairs “ of the Amir tribe, who are among those whom the Turkish Government “ have pledged themselves to refrain from interfering with.” And it was pointed out that unless the Turkish troops were withdrawn without delay, the difficulty which arose at Lahej might be repeated. (This difficulty is subsequently referred to as “ the danger of a collision of armed force from which the two countries narrowly escaped last year.” See Lord Derby’s letter to the Turkish Ambassador of 20th April 1871.) 9. The Turkish Government endeavoured to treat the whole matter lightly. They denied interference with Dthali, and refused to release the son of the Alawi Sultan, who had been detained as a hostage, unless the brother of the Sultan of Lahej imprisoned by us w as let go. This produced Lord Derby s Despatch of 30th April 1871 referred to at the beginning of this note. The whole correspondence of 1871 is very instructive as to the policy adopted by the Turks, and the evasion of the local officials. 10. In consequence of the firm attitude taken up by the British Govern ment, the Porte gave way so far as to send an order to Sana for the3 withdrawal of Turkish troops from Dthali. About this time Muhammad Musaid, the Turkish protege, was killed in an attempt to collect taxes in one of the Amiri districts (Hunter), and the Mutasarrif of Taiz, before with- drawing the Turkish troops, appears to have endeavoured to eifect a compromise, by inducing Ali bin Mokhbil to recognise the sovereign rights of the Sultan over his country, as a condition of being “ allowed” to resume his authority. On his refusal, the Turkish authorities forced the Sheikhs of the district (or some of them) to sign a document declaring that he hud no right to rule over the country, and they then appointed Abdulla, the son of Muhammad Musaid, to the chiefship. These occurrences were reported bv the Resident at Aden in his letter of 29th June 1374, and he added that Ali bin Mokhbil relied on the British Government for the restoration of his authority as Amir. In September 1S74, General Schneider reported that the Mutarsnrif of Taiz had written to Ali bin Mokhbil appointing him “ Mudir,” and instructing him to hold himself subordinate to the Kaimmakam of Kataba. The attention of the Turkish Government was drawn to the matter, but they made evasive replies, reverting to the affairs of Labej, with which they had no concern whatever. In June 1875, the Ambassador at Constantinople addressed a note to the Porte pointing out that the continued disobedience of Ahmad Ayub Pasha, the Governor-General of Yemen, had prevented the promises of the Ottoman Government from being carried out, and asking that peremptory orders might he sent for the withdrawal of any troops or zaptiehs who might still be within the limits of any of the nine tribes, more especially from Dthali. The reply to this was that the Ottoman Government had ordered the withdrawal demanded, provided Dthali was found to be within the district of the Amirs! Bombay Litter. No. 32, dated 2(jth June 1880. Aden Letter No. 471, dated 29th J une 1874. Secret Letter from Aden, No. 37, dated 7th Nov. 1874. H.C., 497 75. 583/75. 11. The Resident continued to report the interference of the Turks in the Dthali district, but nothing was done, as there was a momentary idea of getting fresh assurances from the Porte. In July I87b, General 472/76. Schneider, being then in England, wrote a memorandum in which lie pointed out that the local Turkish officials had forcibly exercised jurisdiction in Dthali for over three years, notwithstanding the repeated representations of Her Majesty’s Government. He pointed out the danger of allowing the matter to drop, as if the Dthali district fell permanently into their hands, Turkish influence would be felt in the next district, that of the Alawis, from which it would be extended to the Haushabis and Subaihis. 12. On 12th September 1876, Sir H. Elliot addressed a strongly worded 557 7(&gt;. note to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which lie pointed out that the distinct promises of the Imperial Government had been very im perfectly carried out, and that attempts were being made to include a portion of the Amiri territory in the Ottoman dominions. He said that Her Majesty’s Government could not continue for an indefinite time renewing remonstrances to which no attention was paid. They expected that stringent instructions would he issued for the withdrawal of all Turkish officials, and troops, regular and irregular, from Dthali ; also that the local officials would cease from interference with the affairs of the Amir’s territory, and in particular that they would abstain from interposing obstacles to the return of the Amir Ali bin Mokhbil. 13. In the meantime, however, previous remonstrances had taken some effect, and the Turks had withdrawn from Dtliali, though apparently not altogether from the district. The correspondence forwarded by the Resident in reporting this* included a joint pro- * Adeu ]etter &gt; No - 56 &gt; dated - 6tl ‘ Au o ust elamation by the Governor-General of Yemen, and the Mushir, or Marshal, commanding the Army Corps in Yemen, in which the “ Sheikhship of Dthali is returned to Amir Ali Mokhbil” on account of the “flight” of Abdulla bin Musaid, and the people of the district are ordered to obey him. The assertion of Turkish sovereignty over the country of our stipendiary was thus maintained, while the demands of the British Government as icgards Ali bin Mokhbil were given effect to ; but it was hoped that this was done by the local officials merely to cover their retreat, and that actual interference would thenceforth cease.Secret Despatch to India, No. 25, dated 15th March 1877. Enclosure in Bombay Letter, No. 32, dated 26th June 1880. Enclosure as above. 1 I Tt has seemed necessary to state the circumstances up to this point in the recent occurrences and present situation on the Dthali plateau. 15 The points to be noted are, first, that the Amir of Dthali has from the time of the P acquisitionof Aden been a stipendiary of the British Government and that his country was regarded as being as much withm the sphere Brifeh*influence as ihe territories of the Abdalh ^dth i.or raush^i tribes, which are in close proximity to that place. Secondly, tha - • f Government repeatedly denied, in the most emphatic manner any ri-ht of the Turks to occupy, or in any way interfere with, the country undei the Amir and our claim to exclusive jurisdiction in this country was as often acknowledged by the Ottoman Government. Thirdly, that notwithstanding the repeated assurances of the Porte, and in spite of their instructions to the Governor-General of Yemen, the local officials persistently disobeyed or . evaded the orders they had received. They imprisoned our stipendiary, set up and supported a rival chief, and when compelled to abandon tins course, bad the audacity to themselves appoint the rightful Amir to the chiefslnp, as if he had been a Turkish subject. 16 I think it is not too much to say that a similar course of interference and aggression has been pursued by successive generations of Turkish officials, 0 with slight intermission, to the present day. 17 So far from the Turks ceasing to interfere with the Amiri territories after the restoration of Ali bin Mokhhil, we find him repeatedly complaining to the Resident of intrigue and encroachment on their part. At the same time the Governor-General of Yemen, following the usual Turkish methods, preferred counter complaints of encroachment on the part of the Amir, and the situation in the Dthali country was only a degree more satisfactory than before. With a view to ending, if possible, the continually recurring disputes, the Resident at Aden was authorised, in March 1877, to endeavour to arrange with the Governor-General of Yemen for the settlement by arbitration of the boundaries between the Turkish territories and those of the Amir. Nothing came of this, however, and in 1880, Captain (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel) Hunter, was sent up to Dthali, with the Aden Troop, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Stevens, apparently with the object of ascertaining the actual condition of affairs, and the limits of the Amir s territory. * 18. Hunter s Report is well known. In the historical portion he says that when Ali bin Mokhbil at last re- * Khobar, Monadi, Alkaradth, Shaub 1 CO y ere d his dominions, he found that Saoud, and Al Wabih. villages* had been lost to him owing to the submission of the headmen, either voluntarily or forced, to the Turkish Government. He also states that the Amir’s country, on the plateau, extended eastward to Kharafa and Jabal Harir; while on the west it was hounded by Jabal Jahaf. “ The northern boundary,” he says, “may “ be called the line joining the villages of Sarati and Al Shaara. Within “ these limits, however, are situated numerous Shaari villages which are in “ the hands of the Turks. Beyond them are located a few villages belonging “ to the Amir, together with other hamlets to which the Amir lays claim.” On his map Hunter has dotted in the line between Sarah and Al Shaara, and he has also shown a line somewhat further north which he calls “ old Amiri proximate boundary.” It will be observed that botli report and map are rather vague, hut I should he inclined to think that Hunter considered the line from Sarati to Al Shaara as a rough boundary up to which the country was practically in the hands of the Amir, although certain Shaara (which we now spell Shairi) villages, within it, were paying revenue to the Turks; also that the Amir claimed villages beyond the line. It should be remembered that only a comparatively short time had elapsed since Amir Ali bin Mokhbil had returned to Dthali; that he was personally neither very strong nor very popular, and that a certain number of the Sheikhs and' lieadmcnof the district were politically supporters of his cousin and rival ' Abdulla hm Muhammad Musaid; also that with these latter the Turkish officials were continually intriguing. In fact the district had not settled down, ana could not be expected to have settled down, under the circum stances, without the presence on the spot of a British Agent with an escort ° f i U f 0&lt; ^l • ! CP n rt ’ therefoi ‘ e ’ while showing in a general wav w lat Ah hm Mokhbil actually possessed on the plateau at the time of his visit, does not indicate, except by the &lt;: old Amiri boundary line ” on the map, the limits ol the country which should have lieen his by right. The old Amiri boundary line appears to me to very nearly agree with°the line now claimed by the British Commission, and it will no doubt be noted that Hunter makes Jabal Jahaf range the Amir’s western boundary. He thus distinctly includes the villages at its eastern foot ; and as regards the country to the west of the range, the Sheikhs of which are dependent on Dthali/though paving- little or no revenue, nothing seems to have been known about^it at this period. 19. In forwaiding Colonel Hunters Beport, General Loch represented t iat, in consequence of the failure of the attempts to come to an arrangement with the Turks regarding the Amiri boundary, the fact of continued Turkish a §S r ® ss i° n had to be laced. Ibis was followed by a letter reporting the Fnc. in activity of the lurks within the Amirs jurisdiction, and their intrigues with Bombay the Sayads of Dthubiyat, which is a place considerably to the°south of Letter Hthali. Xo - 32 &gt; 26th June/80. 20. Her Majesty’s Government then proposed “ an arbitral delimitation ” of the Dthali frontier, by a British cilicer, in concert with the Turkish authorities. But this did not suit the Turkish Government, who, instead, raised the old claim of the Sultan of lurkey to the whole of Arabia, and even went so far as to complain of the purchase of certain lands in the neighbourhood of Aden from the Sultan of Lahej. Lord Granville replied in a Bespatch. dated 10th January ISbB, in which he expressed the surprise h C 21 s 3 of Her Majesty's Government at the renewal of pretensions which had so often been declared to he inadmissible, and stated that Her Majesty’s Government had no intention of withdrawing from the position they had consistently maintained, nor did they recognise the right of the Porte to raise any question as to their dealings with the rulers of Lahej or Dhali. Lord Granville added that the demarcation of the boundary was considered essential “ in order to prevent the constant renewal of discussions between the two Governments.” 21. Still the Turkish Government would not agree to a demarcation, and matters continued in an unsatisfactory state. The question was then first raised of establishing a regular protectorate over the tribes in the neighbour hood of Adeu, and in August 1886 Lord Dufferin proposed that an effective Government protectorate should be established, once for all, over the Arab tribes from of India Sheikh Sayad (opposite to Perim) to the frontiers of Oman. “ We would s ^ ret “ then ask the Turks to consent to a delimitation of our protected territorv in the “ direction of theirs. If they agreed we would enter into a formal convention “ with them. If not, we would lay down the limits of the protectorate without “ their consent- and make them respect them. As to the Dthali territory, “ we would make some concessions to the Turks if they could in this way he “ induced to enter into a convention. In dealing with other tribes in “ the vicinity of Aden it would he necessary to avoid including within our “ limits any tracts which would he likely to gravitate of their own “ accord to the Turks.” 22. I do not understand from this that Lord Dufferin intended to yield to the Turks any territory, whether included in that belonging to the “ nine tribes,” or to other tribes to which protection might he extended, the Sheikhs and people of which were unwilling to become Turkish subjects. There is a note to paragraph 5 of the Despatch which would seem to mply that the Government of India did not mean to allow the Turks to encroach the territories of the Amir, although Major Hunter had actually Letn-r No. 3 J, datvd Gth Aug./SO. suggested, that uplands. 5 S. 28. should allowed to absorb Dufferin was apparently B1276/86. Surveyor- General of India’s Letter No. 1624 S., 20th June/93. Page 104 of Aitchison, Vol. XI. concessions ” to the Turks as regards outlying villages, if demarcation would be thereby facilitated. The expression “ hamlets on the uplands” does not appear to me to mean the villages on Dthali itself. I think it is also worth noting that himself a satisfactory ruler, and that the plateau, which would include not proved were disgusted with him. 'Besides, the country was still very imperfectly known. Ali bin Mokhbil had the Aden authorities 23. The proposals of the Government of India were not communicated to the Porte, as it was not considered desirable at that time to do so ; but shortly afterwards (1888-89) protectorate treaties were entered into with the tribes lying along the coast from the Atiffii Subaihis on the west to the Mahri on the east. As regards the inland tribes, the Government of India decided that, before concluding protectorate, or other, agreements with them, it would he necessary to undertake a survey of the country, fuller knowledge of which, and of the condition of the tribes, was required. 24. This brings us to Captain Wahab’s survey of 1891-92. I have not been able to find the actual instructions given to Wahab, but he was to survey the districts occupied by the tribes in political relations with the Aden*Piesidency. No particular mention was made of boundaries, and he was, I understand, especially directed not to go into Turkish territory. 25. It is obvious that these instructions would not facilitate the survey of such a district as that of Dthali, in which the Turks still maintained a hold on some villages within the limits of the Amir’s territory, and that a map produced under such conditions would hardly be altogether reliable for political purposes. Captain Wahab’s map and report were published in 1893. There is no boundary line on the former, but the latter contains a list of villages,—Turkish, Amiri, Haushabi, &amp;c.,—which, if read in conjunction with the map, indicates with tolerable clearness where the boundary would run, for a considerable distance, along the borders of the tribes named. There is also a tracing, giving a skeleton of the survey, on which this boundary has been drawn by Wahab himself. But this is quite separate from the printed map and report, and was furnished for a particular purpose. The line indicated runs from the high range of Jabal Mares, westward, along the spur on which the village of Lakhmat-al-Shiub, or Shaab, is situated, and then in a general southerly direction, leaving Minadi, A1 Wabh, Jalas, and Jelali to the Turks. Passing very near Dthali, it continues soutlrward nearly to the low country, placing a great extent of inhabited hills and valleys on the Turkish side, before turning westward to the Tiban, which it crosses above A1 Kama. This line would give to the Turks a far greater extent of country than they had in 1880, and would seem to indicate that they had been extraordinarily successful in their encroachments without attracting much attention. 26. There is no doubt that active interference, and to some extent encroachment, had been going on ever since the restoration of the Amir ; but after the v r ithdraw r al of the Turkish troops at that time it appears to have taken the form of periodical raids or incursions. On these occasions troops w ould appear to have been marched through the country as far as the inhabited valleys to the south and south-w r est of Dthali, and revenue was taken by force from such villages as were visited. Even Dthi Haran, the ancestral property of the Amir s family, w r as thus harried ; but from the knowledge we now possess it seems very doubtful whether any villages, except the Shairi villages on the plateau, to be hereafter alluded to, paid revenue to the Turks con tinuously, or at all, unless compelled to do so. We have, moreover, good reason to believe that the boundary indicated bv Wahab in 1892 w r as entirely incorrect. 2/. It will be convenient here to note that Ali bin Mokhbil died in September 1886. His successor, Shaif bin Saif (a first cousin), was duly elected and recognised by the British Government. He appears at first to ia^e been distrusted by the Aden authorities as Ali bin Mokhbil w r as, but he would seem to have united all the Sheikhs and head men of his6 ds outlying villages, if demarcation would sion “ hamlets on the uplands” does not bs on the plateau, which would include that Ali hin Mokhbil had not proved that the Aden authorities were rather country was still very imperfectly known. mient of India were not communicated to desirable at that time to do so; hut shortly treaties were entered into with the tribes tiffii Subaihis on the west to the Maliri on tribes, the Government of India decided ite, or other, agreements with them, it a survey of the country, fuller knowledge he tribes, w T as required.

The survey having been carried out as far as was then practicable, protective treaties were^ entered into with the Haushabi, Alawi, and Lower \ aftai tribes, but the affairs of Dthali remained in the same unsettled condition. There would seem, however, to have been a period of comparative inaction on the part of the Turks from about 1892 or 1893, to 1899 or 1900. This is accounted for by the fact, only recently learnt, that when the Turkish hold on Yemen was shaken by the rising of Arabs against them in the early nineties, Amir Shaif protected certain Turkish officials who had taken refuse m his country, and even called out a part of his tribal forces to prevent the insurgent Arabs from following them up. It is understood that in giatitude for this assistance the local authorities refrained from troubling the Amir as long as they remained in office. 29. Recently, the aggressive activity of the Turks has been renewed, and complaints were received from Dthali of what appeared to be very serious interference on the part of the Turkish officials at Kataba. These were, however, to some extent balanced by complaints of the Governor General of Yemen of aggression on the part of the Amir, and as no one then at Aden had any personal knowledge of Amir Shaif, or of his country, while the reports from both sides were often practically unintelligible on account of the impossibility of identifying the names of places, the only certain fact was that the former difficulties were being renewed. 3(). It was then proposed that the First Political Assistant at Aden, Major Davies, should visit the Dthali plateau and report on the actual state of affaiis. In forwarding the Residents proposal, the Viceroy suggested Political that the present opportunity should be taken to suggest to the Turks a 1052,1157, demarcation of our protectorate on the basis of the map drawn bv the and 118( V01. survey party of 1891-92. After some delay, Major Davies visited Dthalh and presented an interesting and valuable report, in which be showed the incorrectness of the line indicated by Wahab in 1892, and also that the only 73/01. places which could he said to be in possession of the Turks, were the four Shairi villages, Jelali, Jalas, Lakhmat-al-Hajfar, and Al Wabh. These four villages had been retained ever since the restoration of Amir Ali bin Mukhbil, and the Turks had appointed a Sheikh over them, who collected the revenue on their behalf. There were no Turkish officials or troops at any of the villages, except at Jaleli, where there bad been a post for many years. Only a few weeks before Major Davies’s arrival, however, the Turks had taken possession of an isolated hill called Jabal Shahad (or Suheb), about half-a-mile south-east of Jaleli. and had planted a garrison there. This bill completely commanded the kafila route, and the presence of a military post on it was obviously objectionable. Major Davies also reported that the Turks were endeavouring to obtain possession of Mafari, a small district on the southern continuation of Jabal Jahaf, about four miles in a straight line south west of Dthali. In submitting Davies’s report, the Resident drew special 73/01. attention to the military occupation of Jabal Shabad, which was in reality a more serious matter than the erection of the tower near Addareja which had been destroyed by a force from Aden only a few months before. 31. No notice was taken of this representation, for at that moment the Turks themselves proposed a delimitation of the frontier and it was apparently thought advisable to take advantage of this unexpected offer at once. 2488/01, 32. A British Commission was accordingly appointed, and Colonel Wahab, who had conducted the survey of 1891-92, was placed at its head. Lieutenant-Colonel Abud, an officer whose service at Aden as First Political Assistant had enabled him to acquire considerable know ledge of the affairs of the neighbouring tribes, was appointed to he his colleague. The Turks also appointed a Commission, and the British and Turkish officers met at Dthali in February last (1902). The Turks at once began by asserting the old claim of the Sultan’s Suzerainty over the whole of Arabia, which our Commissioners were of course unable tosuw as:« S ,i, ,lh for L Turkisli 'tol oBd.l,, whrtb., “S ^ of the Commissioners or not, proceeded to occupy the «1 ole of oount^ regarding which there might possibly have 'een a Hip Kirireha Pass tlieir nosts runs from the eastern lulls, near the head of the Kmm ba ass.

In fact the only portion of his dominions which would be left to the Amir, if the 1 uikish line were accepted, would he the village of Dthali on the plateau the narrow valleys running up to the latter from the Alawi country, and the territories nf thty TCntnihi: Halmin. and other tribes subject to the Dthali ehiet. 33 The whole conduct of the Turks since they agreed to the delimitation of the frontier has also been outrageous. Their line of posts is maintained as a frontier to be guarded against invasion. The Amir is cut olf from 1 his villages on the plateau and has been reduced to considerable difficulties in the way of supplies. No party from the British camp is allowed to cross the line, even for the purpose of bringing in forage from the neighbouring villages! and in several instances our people have actually been tired on. 34. Further, the British Commissioners have reason to believe that the Turks have endeavoured to stir up against them the local tribes on their own side of the frontier. There was a large gathering beyond the Tiban in the Mavia district some months ago, which was apparently got together for the purpose of attacking the British camp, hut it was said thau the Sheikhs refused to lead their men in such an enterprise unless the Turks attacked first, and so the plan fell through. 35. However, the survey party with the Commission have succeeded in extending the survey of the country to the westward. This was before the Turkish cordon was drawn as tight as it now is. The Commissioners have also been diligent in collecting information hearing on the question of demarcation, and they have reported that the Amir of Dthali’s dominions, of which he appeared to he in effective possession at the time of their arrival at Dthali, extend to the west and north-west beyond Jabal Jahaf (therefore beyond the limits of the survey of 1891-92), and practically include the whole valley of the Tiban, and all the villages on the plateau up to, and including, Sanah and Lakmat as Shiah, except the four Shairi villages mentioned in paragraph 30, viz., Jaleli, Jalas, Lakmat al Ilajfar, and Al Wabh, which form a sort of Turkish enclave in the Amiri dominions. With regard to the villages between this enclave and Jabal Jahaf, the Amir is in a position to show, and has proved to the satisfaction of the British Commis- sioners, that they have been paying revenue to him continuously for the last 10 years, and the whole of the country claimed by him appears to have been, until the Turkish aggressions of this year, completely under his control. ‘ 36. We have, therefore, at the present time three lines of boundary :— First. The boundary of the Amir’s actual possessions as reported by the British Commissioners. Secondly. The line indicated by Wahab in 1892. Thirdly. The line claimed by the Turks. 37. The line of the Amir’s dominions, as reported by the, British Com missioners, is of course that which he expects us to obtain for him. It is reconcilable with Hunters report and map of 1880, hut entirely at variance9 with W ah ah’s line of 1892. But, as before said, the latter appears to he incorrect. The reasons for this are not difficult to understand. Wahab w 7 as ordered not to go into Turkish territory. It is probable that his assist ants, coming on the Turkish enclave, were led to believe that all the villages to the Tvest were also Turkish. This is the more probable as the survey party wus accompanied by the then Native Assistant Political at Aden, Muhammad Saleh Jafir, who was dismissed a few r years ago for malpractices in connection with his official position. This man used to take from the Chiefs half of their stipends and durbar presents, and it is now believed that, being refused this gratification by Amir Shaif, he endeavoured to injure him as much as possible by misrepresenting facts, by retaining his letters, and even by preventing him from having access to the Resident. There is also a suspicion that Muhammad Saleh Jafir was actually at this time in the pay of the Turks. However this may he, Colonel Wahab has been the first to admit that his line of 1892 is quite unreliable, and he has stated that neither he nor his assistants are really responsible for it, as the information w r as given him, after his return to Aden, by the “ Aden Residency,” which means, in this case, the Is'ative Assistant. 58. The Turkish line is of course preposterous, and His Majesty’s Government have already decided not to admit claims to the hill districts south and south-west of Dthali except perhaps to a portion of Humedi. But with regard to the plateau, there is a disinclination to go behind Wahab’s line of 1892. I earnestly hope, however, that in the final decision there will he no retreat from the position taken up by Lord Derby in 1874, and by Lord P Granville in 1883, and which was again insisted on only last year at the time 2974 /Ind of the Addareja incident. The British Government have consistently claimed 3995 / 73 . the w hole of the territories occupied by the “ nine tribes,” and the Turks have failed to show’ any right to any portion of the Amiri country, except perhaps the small enclave of Shairi villages. They have no maps, they have* produced no documents of any value in support of their assertions, and they appear to rely on the repeatedly rejected pretensions of the Sultan to the whole of Arabia. The Amir on the other hand is in possession of deeds showing ancient possession by his ancestors of the territories which he now rules, and docu- mentarv evidence, such as revenue accounts, of recent administration. 39. Further, the whole proceedings of the Turks have not only been in contravention of the repeated assurances of the Ottoman Government, but entirely out of accord Avith the usages of civilised powers in like cases. Whatever His Majesty’s Government may have admitted in respect of the boundary, it will perhaps be considered that, as the Turks haA'e rejected, AvithouA cven the courtesy of a discussion, the line which we w r ere prepared to accept, and have also treated our Commission, sent at their own invitation, Avith marked disrespect, no expressions or statements on our part need now be held to he binding, and our hands may he considered as practically free ? 40. I am strongly of opinion that the former position of the British Government should be adhered to, and the Turks obliged to evacuate the country in the neighbourhood of Dthali up to the red line of the map accompanying Colonel Wahab’s letter of 7th April 19T&gt;2. With regard to Political, Jalela, and the other three Shairi villages which have been wrongfully 28 / 02 - retained by the Turks since the restoration of Amiri Ali bin Mukhbil, in 1876, thev have taken the revenue from them for so long wdthout remonstrance on our part, that AA’hile insisting on their surrender, and the withdrawal of the troops at Jaleli, we might appropriately offer compensation to the extent of 15 or 20 years’ revenue. It appears to me that if we are ever to reach finality in this matter, the complete withdrawal of the Turks from the neighbourhood of Dthali is absolutely essential. 41. I should like to point out that the Dthali plateau is likely to be in the future of importance to Aden as a sanatarium for troops. The distance to Dthali is about 90 miles, and a light railway might be made for a con siderable portion of the distance at comparatively little cost. The location S. 28. c10 of 200 or 300 British soldiers in this cool and elevated region during the suminer months would probably be of the greatest benefit to the health and efficiency of the garrison, and the establishment of a sanatariurn would enable all ranks to obtain the benefit of an occasional change of climate, the impossihlity of getting which is now a fruitful source of injury to the health of those whose duty ohlitres them to reside at Aden. I mention this merely as showing that the Dthali plateau has for us a value of its own, apart from political questions. But there are reasons of greater importance why His Majesty’s Government should firmly maintain their position with regard to the territories of the Amir. The matter is one which affects our relations with the tribes throughout the whole area under our influence. I have reason to believe that every Chief and Sheikh is watching with intense interest the result of what they consider is a struggle between the British Government and the Turks. We have not at Aden the close support of lar^e military forces as on the frontiers of India. The tribes are only impressed by what they can see and feel, and the bases of our influence over them are, first, money,*secondly, our ability to protect them against Turkish interference. If we now fail to protect the territories of the Amir, the consequences will be a widespread distrust of our powers, or of our good faith, or both, and a change of attitude on the part of the tribes which cannot fail to be to our disadvantage. Even now there are symptoms which cause uneasiness, and I greatly fear that any solution of the present difliculty which does not afford to the Amir substantial justice, would be followed by dsiaffection and serious complications along the whole extent of the frontier of our protectorate. Turkish intrigue in all quarters would be greatly encouraged, wdiile the tribes would either lean towards the Turks, or fight with them, as their spirit and powers of resistance prompted. 42. Lastly there are practical difficulties in the way of any demarcation which would afford the Amir serious reasons for dissatisfaction, or cut off any considerable portion of the territory now owning bis authority. Amir Sbaif has hitherto acted with great moderation and forbearance, though naturally indignant at the high handed proceedings of the Turks in bis dominions, and the forcible occupation of so much of his country. But if he is told that the actual effect of our action will be to permanently deprive him of territory from wdiich he derives a large part of his revenues, it is by no means impossible that he will either endeavour to assert his rights by force (wffiich at the present time he might be able to do), or will go over to the Turks altogether. If he w r ere to take the latter course and order the British Commission out of his country, they would have to retire, as their supplies and their security are both to a great extent dependent on his good will. This w r ould be so humiliating and harmful a conclusion of the affair that it can hardly be contemplated. 43. Also, the Sheikhs and people of Jabal Jahaf, and the hills and valleys between the Dthali plateau and the Tiban, who acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy, and are eager for British protection, will not tamely submit to he handed over to the Turks. The country is somewhat thickly populated, and the people are more warlike than those of the plateau. The Turks have, it appears, never been able to penetrate to any extent into this tract, and the inhabitants now declare that they will resist any attempt on their part to levy taxes or take possession of the country. In this case, it would, I think, be hardly possible for the Amir, as Chief, to avoid giving them support and assistance, wherever the Hue may have been drawn by us. This would, of course, lead to complaints on the part of the Turks, and to a continuance of the state of trouble and unrest which has so long continued, and which it is the chief object of the demarcation to put an end to.
