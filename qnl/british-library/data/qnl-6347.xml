In this connection I am desired by the Resident to ask for any suggestions which you may have to offer relative to the feasibility of maintaining a permanent organisation for quarantine purposes on a mimimum scale.

I now enclose a copy of his memorandum upon the sub ject for such further observations as you may wish to offer. It does not seem necessary for you to discuss the question with the Sheikh at present unless you see any advantage in doing so. On getting your further views as to the. maximum proposals which we could place before the Sheikh with even a remote chance of success, I would lay the position before the Government of India, it being quite understood that in any case Sheikh Mubarek will have to be handled very cautiously in the matter. As regards the question of an allowance for doctor Padimaster, it will be more convenient to refer this point to Government simultaneously with our views as to the nature of the preventive arrangements which we con sider may be feasible^ I will await, therefore, your fur— th.er remarks on the general question.I have the honour to be Sir, Your moai^obedient servant. ajor. Political* Resident in the Persian Gulf.MKMORAIfnuM. by the Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Officer. irom a quarantine point of view the outline of pro posed staff etc., in paragraph 3 of the Political Agent's letter is insufficient, but as he considers it the only feasible method at present, it might be tried until the people become more accustomed to the idea of quarantine. I would-however like to suggest, (1) . that more permanence be given to the quarantine ataff by engaging them on monthly pay. (2) . the advisability of replacing the present quarantine detention in booms, by detention in some selected quarantine station. If any of the Gulf ports become in -fected these passengers may have to pass several days in the booms, and there is no arrangement for separating the sick from the healthy, should disease brea^: out, when they are under quarantine detention. I would further suggest that, if it is found feasible u-o ma.^e a detention camp, rooms should also be provid ed for 1st and 2nd class passengers, and. that pro vided the quarters are kept in good order, the quar antine restrictions be imposed against everyone, with the exception perhaps of the Political Agent and the Sheikh. The exemption of 1st Class passengers, al- thoogh quite justifiable and consistent with the Paris Convention, cannot but tend to make the quaran tine unpopular amongst the class who must submit to detention. (^). that once a quarantine station has been provided, a disinfecting stove will become necessary. (4). that one allotment beisg made (1) for providing an ample supply of disinfectants, and (2) for the local incidental expenses. (sd). T. S. B.

M w boat was the first to arrive and I remained on the steamer for some con siderable time , watched the Sheikh’s customs-officer and , in fact , ar\,bod„ w r ho pleased , board the steamer and the passengers with their luggage being disembarked The steamer arrived about.. ZO minutes after midnight and left at jSa.m. and was on the move , before f reach ed the shore . 5 . Tn the afternoon on .f'rida^ , visited the Sheikh ; T cuite expected , as ’ have saxd above ,that I should find that the Sheikh’s instmotions to the Assistant Surgeon had been misunderstood • ’ opened the conversa tion b^ remarking that f should be giad if the Sheikh would be so good as to tell me the tenour of hiS in structions to the Assistant Surgeon which had astonish ed me considerably • The Sheikh as ted me what the Assistant Surgeon had reported and I told him the substance of the report tnat ■_ had the aonour to srbmit to ^ ou with my letter quoted above . The Sheikh replied that the Assistant Surgeon’s report, was correct in eve^ particular and added that he had written to tkc steame rjauthorities in Bomba^ to sa w that quarantin w as Imposed on all fast mail steamers and that therefore they should no longer book passengers mo jioweit by those steamers . 0 # remarked t'^iat the passengers irom this .ast mail had been landed and had not gone to Basra •The Sheica began to ten me that the 0 had not been landed , when/*. /s, out him short remarking that T was on the steamer ana saw them being disembarked . lie then said that it was not in his boats and T did not think it worth while to point out that there were oni„ three boats alongside the steamer , while Twas there ; that one of these was TL own which naturaxi w carried no passengers ar.d that the first boat after mine into which T saw a number of ndian passengers being disembarked had carried one of his principal customs officers to the steamer/ . ihe Sheikh then added that he detained an the passeng^ ers until noon on Thursda^ in the boat harbour . ;s the passengers for the most part belonged to a gang of fndian boatmen who have come to look after a wrecked dinghy , subseciuent enquiries have served to confirm m», first impression that this statement was utterly £k false . The passengers were seen b w two natives of India in a coffee-shop in the bazaar eari w on Thursday . 7 . The Sheikh then began to ia^ down his views about c uarar.tine generally and brought out the fatalistic 4 ^ saving that he had already quoted in his letter to ^ our address , forw r arded with x, no: 374 dated ^4/6/03 ,r ^a sh’fiiah w a':con wa ma 1 am us ha lam w akun ,! • T countered w'ith the eauaii., weliknown Muhammadan tradition which ! described as the father of all quarantine theories ' To the place in which there is sickness , go not ; and , if sickness comes upon ^ou , flee not . 'I showed the Sheikh that , in strict obedience to pure Muhamm adan tradition , no sound Muhammadan should visit either Bomba., or Karachi ahd that our Quarantine was merely an endeavour to carr^ out the spirit of that tradition &gt; while not observing , in ail its destructive strictness, the letter • 8 . The Sheikh replied , admitting the tradition , that, on the whole , he preferred the letter and that he and his people would be inclined to do without Bomba u and Karachi altogether , if going to those places meant®^) I soloiu , a 01 rnies .and regulations . They ere all for freedoiu trnl^ audacious snaiveiiient froiii such a despo'u • He then asKed abom x,he slow mails ana I said wnat it seeiaed. , so far as i had seen , unnecessary'- vo place any re s trio- x.ions on them , as it was barely possible for passengers t,o land befor;- noon on rhursday r s , by which nme they would have completed ohe five days passage from the las^T infected port , but , that , if the Sheikh wished ,they should , in -- he strict interpretation of the Paris Con vention be detained until noon and ex mined by a comp etent medical officer ; that , inthe event of sic-mess at Bahrein or Bushire , a longer detention woulc i? necessary • The Sheikh then said that , if quarantine was essential , they' would do without the slow steamers also . 9.1 also asked what wo ; ld be done to prevent people from the shore landing on ships under quarantine and the Sheikh said that he would not send boats hd that vie could arrange to get our post and transact our business ant that his own people ami boats would not go to the mail boat . I stated tfl-t , of course , we Lsr.O'.fW strictl;.' observe t-^.e RheUh'a orders ua t trjnsiact our business from the ladder and t : e Rheilth renlie l th .t we were •.1 perfect libeny “o act in any' manner that we Thoirtp fi- . 10.

A visit from one of the Hamburg-/-merika liners would seem to be a peculiarly appropriate occasion for our show of force . But , from nh limited and local point of view , with the utmost respect , I regard with grave apprehension the barest possibility of our steamers returning ignomiously in the tail of the Hamburg-/me rika . The effect on local opinionwould be deplorable and a perfect triumph for Sheikh Mobarak .4 Vi Offioo of tha Politioal Kovfelt# Proia To Kovreit /S July 1P08.

To Major P.3.Cox,C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir, Bushi re I have/the honour to invite a reference to n&amp;' letner Ho.474, dated the 81st August 1908 for warding the Assistant Surgeon’s quarantine report on the visit of S.S.’•Durara” on the 19th instant. rak a Persian nakhoda of one of the booms sent if permission was granted 'oo land it*. 3. This main was seen Vne Assistant Surgeon,the local Agent and self walking on x-he steamer in contravention of the Sheikh’s orders that nobody from the shore was to board the sxeeiuer.I called him up to me on the ladder and called upon the nakhoda of the local Agent’s jolly boat,to ask if he recognised him*Rajab said that he knew the man and gave me his name. 4 . I asned the man what he was doing on board the steamer when Sheikh I lobarak had issued orders that all shore people were to remain in xhe boats and not board the sxe mier.The man replied that he had no orders,I said that he would have xo ex plain that to-morrow xo Sheikh Mobarak.Tha man xnen 3 ai d that, i f tho s e we re xhe She ikh ’ s o rde r 3 , he wa 3 2 The man to whom he refers was one Moba-(£&gt; going doivn inxo hiss boat, and disembarked quietly withZi out further demur. 5. The next news I had of Hobarak wax the local Agent,Hiraa Muhcunmad, informed me that Llobarah had been imprisoned the suae night b} tne Sheikh's head Custom house officer,Abdul Mehsin.While ’uhe local Agent vns telling me this news,Hajab,the Agent's nakhoda came to look for him to say that Sheikh Mobarak wished to see *one A^ent and his nakhoda, Rajab, as soon as possible.The news was then that Sheikh Mobarak had threatened to kill Mobarak.I sent a verbal message by the local Agent to say that I would visit the Sheikh that afternoon and would bring the local Agent with me and instructed him not to give any evidence except in my presence. 6. This nakhoda Mobarak's manner had im pressed me favourably and he seemed to me to be speaking the truth when he said that he had received no orders.I asked the local Agent whether he had any reason to suppose that the Sheikh's orders had not really been conveyed to the boatmen.The local Agent said that he had been present when Abdul Mens in was . giving the boatmen their instructions and they were ^ so much at variance with the orders that he had heard J the Sheikh expressing Ms intention to give as noted in paragraph 7 of my letter No.469, dated 19th August 1908 that he actually asked Abdul llehsin whether the orders had been changed and whether he should not ask the Sheikh if ihese were correct.I as&amp;ed the Agent point blank if he had heard Abdul Mehsin direct the boatmen not to board the vessel and he said that he had heard no orders of that kind. 7. In the course of the day I received the letter from the local Agent of which a copy is for warded herewith.I considered myself bound to try and place the facts before the Sheikh and was unable to allow the local Agent to efface himself.I gave■the Sheikh my acco;mt of vfhat* took, place on boar* joaro^i a ■the steamer, stated that 'ohe Mobarak was undoubtecfe- -ly on board *ohe steamer, said that he had no orders and that,as soon as he was told what the Sheikh's orders were,proceeded to obey them quietly and prompt^ -iy. Sheikh what he had heard of Abdul Mehsin's instruct ions to the boatmen which he did as quoted in para graph 6 above .The Sheikh then sent for Abdul kehsin, warned him that the onus was on him, info me d him that if he did not carry out the orders given him, the Sheikh would break his back and asked him what orders he actually gave.Abdul Mehsin replied that he had given orders that any boatman 'Who boar led the steamer would have both his hands cut off .He was asked to produce witnesses to his statement and said that he was ready* to do so. 9. At the interview of the 86th reported in / my letter ITo.485 of to-day * s date the Sheikh inform- ed that Abdul Mehsin had been able to produce his witnesses(sisr of them)and commented on the difficulty of knowing what the truth was when such different accounts were placed before him.The Sheikh appeared to imply that this was an additional reason for not sending tally' clerks to the steamer^.I learn tnat Mobarak was eventually released without further pu nishment at the intervention of the 'harem**. 10 , This incident has been reported in full because of the possible importance that may be at tached to it later on. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. 3. I then told the local Agent to tell the /i Political Agent,Koweit.No 10, dated Shiraz, the loth (received 24th) August 1908 From —Major P.Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq , C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Fore Department. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 1802, dated W; \ f.it letter No. 314, dated ..it, 'un. 1908. 7 th . June I have the honour to forward ' „ No. 348. dated 28th June 1908 copies of the reports cited m the margin „ No. 386, dated i2tb July 1908. f rom Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject of the Quarantine arrangements connected with that port. Koweit 1 2. In the passage marked in his letter to me dated 14th June, Sheikh Muba rak finds it convenient to put into the mouths of the “ princes of Central Arabia the expression of sentiments with which he himself is imbued in regard to Quar antine, and practically informs us that if we do not co operate with him in the matter of his Fao properties we must not expect him to defer to our wishes in regard to Quarantine administration. While it is quite possible that there is a measure of truth in the assertion that he has to meet frequent demurs on the part of the Sheikhs of the interior whose families or follovyers are subjected to quarantine detention on arrival at Koweit, his statements in this regard are doubt less much exaggerated. 3. As the Sheikh (perhaps as Major Knox suggests, in order to forestall an intimation to that effect from ourselves) has spontaneously asked the British India Steam Navigation Company to cease booking passengers to Koweit by the Fast Mail steamers, no need for any emergent action on our part seems to exist, and until the political side of the question is decided, the Residency Sur geon finds difficulty in making revised suggestions from a medical point of view. Politically speaking the extent to which Sheikh Mubarak is likely to be guided by our advice in this matter in the near future seems to depend chiefly on the measure of assistance which we decide to give him in connection with his Fao properties, and 1 can only suggest with much respect that both questions be considered simultaneously in their bearing upon one another. Meanwhile as there is happily no epidemic in the Gulf itself and as the slow mails are out of quarantine before they reach Koweit, perhaps the Sheikh's solu tion of the difficulty will be held to suffice for the time being, unsatisfactory though his attitude undoubtedly is. I am asking the First Assistant to confer with the Bushire Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company with a view to his instructing Com manders of Fast Mail steamers proceeding to Koweit to assist the Political Agent by taking the necessary steps for preventing persons from the shore boarding their ships while in harbour.

' ^ It is with the hand of friendship I have received your letter dated the 7th Jamadi-al-Awwal, 1326 H., and what you ordered was made known—the expres sion of your sorrow at your not being able to be present at the assembly of the marriage night of our son Hamad because of your absence in the month of May, and we were still more sorry at wanting your presence, which would have been a reason for increase in our rejoicings and perfecting our joy, and we were proud and honoured in the presence of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief, and we obtained perfect joy from his visit to our town, which is to be con sidered the town of Government, and from the friendship of Major Knox, etc., etc., and likewise his friendship with my brother Mo’iz-as-Sultana, Sardar Arfa’, the Sheikh Khazal Khan when he honoured our town, and altogether we were grate ful to the presence of Major Knox, etc., for his friendship and his reckoning our house to be the house of the Government, and I am proud in this reckoning' and certainly Your Honour believes in my friendship and love towards the precious Imperial English Government and obedience to its lofty commands and the facilities which I procure for the Consul who is with us in everything that he demands from me according to the order of Government in his journeys in the Arabian peninsula, whether it may be to Anta’a which is near A1 Ahsa and the place of settling of the tribes of A 1 Ahsa, and I cause to go with him the chiefs of the tribes aforesaid in his service, or it may be to A 1 Hafar, which is the boundary between us and Nejd, and 1 cause to go with the Consul the Amirs of the Arabs in his service and it may be to Basra on the desert road my servants are in his service, and from these facilities which I grant, I have seen opposition from the Turks and universal injury to my property in Fao which is the livelihood of the family of Subah, all of them. The Turks have destroyed it. And if mat ters remain in this opposition, we shall abandon it (viz., the land) and also be fore this, two years ago, my clerks were driven out from my house, and my pro perty at Fao and 6,ooo maunds of my dates were destroyed, and worse than the destruction was the driving out of my clerks before all people and the injury to my honour and all that which happened to my property before I have placed it. and what has happened now, I have also placed it before your exalted Honour and before the Consul who is with us. And besides what they are doing to my property of injury, they have also stined up the most corrupt of mankind, who is estimated by yourself and others than vourself as a noted pirate, Nagaimish, upon the boundaries between Fao and Ma aamir, and they send their servants, the regimental officer and the rem- mental clerk and the accountant of A 1 Ahsa and the' Kaim Mokam, and they Tre present at the boundaries, and they demand three men from Fao and three men from Ma aamir and three men from Fao come present, three good old men born in Fao, and they as*? them to swear about the Fao boundaries. And they stood on the creek and swore honestly that this is the boundary of Fao and Ma’aamir and those whom Nagaimish presented by force when they ask them for their oath, they hesitate, because they are liars and not from the people o Ma aamir, and they see the appearance of opposition of those who come from .v a aamir and they know that the truth is with the persons tvho come from the people of Fao. Then when they come back to Basra and their friends ask them what do you write ? They answer : “ The right is with Mubarak, but we see he intention of the Wall and we write.” And, apart from that, when my servants are present, my^ agents in Fao, only two men and their rosaries in their hand3, and when Nagaimish is present he brings with him 200 men, armed with firearms. J\ow that is the limit of his power, but 1 have thousands and am submissive and fry conciliatory proceedings, but those who are determined to do me injury—and the causes are evident—from the direction of the north are exciting Nagaimish, and from the south their soldiers and officials and the Wall writes to the Kaim3 Mokam who is honoured among them and under their influence and threatens him with responsibility, and he writes to them the actual state of affairs and mentions to them “ Mubarak has not embanked in my days, and he has no unreclaimed lands to embank. This is in my days, and the questioning is from the people who have information that these embankments are of old time and they are always repairing from it.” And the Wall is bent on an injury and does not accept the report of the Kaim Mokam and has destroyed my property, and I ask for pity from your high position that they should treat me with justice, and that they should send from the people of Basra persons who are under their influence like the Nakib of the Sharifs of Basra and Mahmud Pasha, the Wakil i- Sannia, and people like them that they may see and I will accept. And I, my first treaty with the Government, my first conditions were the preservation of my property, and they gave me an order for that from your predecessor present with me and its copy with you. That is not for the protection of Koweit. The matter of Koweit is to me a small affair. Its people will defend it some how or another. My only object is the protection of my property and my honour. It is not a question of covetousness. I have plenty ol wealth and sitting down I see neglect on your part. And I and my property and my good name and my honour are entering into the protection of the precious Imperial English Government, and in spite of all these troubles which I see from the Turks, I am still patient and following your orders, which I shall perform whether in quarantine or other ways. And your lofty Presence ordered that the quarantine has been arranged in Maskat and Bahrein. I would present to your Highness, although that is an evident matter, which you know, but for the manifestation of the position I do not resemble my brothers, the Amir of Maskat and the Amir of Bahrein. For the aforesaid, passengers do not go to them in the mails except by chance from among the people of their towns. I am the ruler of Koweit and the whole of the Arabian peninsula, and in it many great princes under my orders and entrusting their heads to me and those who come from India and other places are not the people of Koweit but of all the tribes and of all the people of Nejd and, as soon as there was the name of the quarantine, I began to content them’ and the princes addressed me about their families and their dependants and followers who come in the mail steamers why I was stopping them in the harbour when thev were coming from a long journey and those awaiting from a distant road and stopping them that they should not see them nor greet them. Then I content them and answer them that this is the order of the Government. They answer, “No matter! that is, let the order of the Government proceed for separating us and we are Islam. We say what God wills, will be and what he does not wish, will not be. And we were vexed by the quarantine, and it does not repel. God is the repeller. And we see your servants w'ho are in your possessions at Fao flying away from Turkish oppression, and they in your assembly inform us of all that is going on against (your) property.” Also, in our places, reaches us news of all that goeson against you from the injuries inflicted by the Turks, especially against your Eao property. Now we will not consent to these troubles which are against Shara’, and we will not agree about you that you should be patient under these troubles which are happening against your property. Then if this Government whom you and we are following—at your desire expressed to us—will repel from your property, then it is due from you that you conciliate them in such a way as may not injure. ’Then jf we see that, then we shall know that your opinion has hit the mark. But if the Turks go on in this way in the injury of your property without right and there is no stopping of that, enough, we have not seen a place for protection. We do not u'ant protection.” Now the intention is that I should make plain the circumstances and in spite of all this, I am under your orders And the passengers who come in the mail boats, there will be from the people of Koweit one in ten and nine from the families of the tribes and people of Nejd and the Princes whose followers will come in the mail steamers in their address to me they have the right on their side against me because I also have seen your carelessness about the protection of my property for the repelling from it in the path of right and the present custom*4 'Xv^y In Basra (apparently Turkish vexations and misruleV And in spite of all this, I am at your orders, if you order me to be patient under the injury to my property and the objections urged by the Arab princes against me, then I, according to my custom, will rest patient under orders, but I say—“ This is against your well known and proved pity and your protection to every One who flees for shelter to your shadow. Now I and my name and my property are under your protection and under your orders. Then it was incumbent on me to present the circumstances. Your Consul who is in Basra heard from the VVali that this land which Mubarak has enclosed came out of the river. Then what comes out of the river there is in it to the Government a right. Now their fort has been built 22 years from its com mencement, and the mud which they have used to embank is from this place, and also this embankment which I enclosed for the protection of my property is fourteen years old, and yearly I repair it and others not less than three or four times. And their officials were looking on at it and did not molest me. Then, if it is a fact that there is in my possession land coming out from the river, it is necessary that they should deal with me according to the rules and precedents, as they do with others, according to the agreements of the assembly of the Idara who will make me owmer of the land in the change of records. The ownership in the change of records is to the owner of the lands whether myself or another. Then I demand right like all the Basra proprietors, that they should deal with me, by sending persons of Basra, as I have mentioned in my petition above, who know about properties and their present day rules, and that they should see this land which they are quarrelling with me about, and l will abide by whatever these people may say, after they see it And I also will make present with them whomsoever you may appoint^ the Consul at Basra or another that he may be present. Then that is what is incumbent upon you that you should watch over my rights. Otherwise, if 1 have no right, at that time, I will be content. Also the princes wdio are now objecting against me, when they have seen assistance from you, in the protection of my rights they also will be content and will not object against me. And this contradiction is only from the Wali of Basra, and your Cov er iment has ordered that they sent the doctor especially on account of quarantine, and what we know is that the doctor was sent by the Government out of pity for v t ^ ie comfort of the sick of the people. This is according to our request w hen we asked for the doctor. Then, when it is incumbent on us to establish an officer of quarantine, we will appoint him from one of our follow’ers, and he will refer to the . doctor. This was what was necessary. We hope for your assistance and may you remain, etc., etc. 14th Jamadi-al-Awwal 1326 H- = 14th June 1908. Seal of Sheikh Mubarak.

KNOX, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. z. Cox, C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour, in continuation of my letter No. 33!;, dated 23rd June 1908, to report the subsequent history of the visit of the S. S. Kasara to t is 3ort on Thursday morning last. o Shnrtlv after the Agent of Messrs. Gray Paul and Co. had received ntimadon sent by me, o S f the latest orders of the Sheikh on the quarantine Son he came to me and asked for permission to try and persuade the Sheikh to alter his decision with reference to this fast mail and the next. was inable to approve this course, as the Sheikh knew perfectly well what he was ' Ind t P hat he is deliberately thwarting us m our proposals to establish marantiiie and trying to convince us that Koweit can do perfectly well without quarantine ana ) g Anvthing therefore, that would persuade him that we ^relncontSienS by his actli, wtuld, I judged only strengthen his determin- ition I saw no objection, however, to his asking the Sheikh to provide t sual boats for conveyance of the passengers, as though the Agent had no infor mation of the Sheikh’s most recent orders, and accepting the Sheikh s decision on the point whatever it might be. o The A^ent returned to me on Wednesday afternoon with the news that 3. I he Agent ret four nassenger boats to proceed to the the Sheikh had t' n P chaims!ances,^! saw'ncfreason whatever P to interfere mail steamer In ion was that the Assistant Surgeon had, or remonstrate and indeed, my nr Sheikh’s orders, in some way or other, managed to misunderstand the Sheikh s orders.4 )tt 4. I made arrangements 1o proceed myself to the steamer to watch events, and, in view of the conflicting reports that I had received as regards the imposi tion of quarantine, I saw no necessity to place myself under any restrictions in that respect. My boat was the first to arrive, and I remained on the steamer for some considerable time, watched the Sheikh’s customs-officer and in fact, any body who pleased, board the steamer and the passengers with their luggage being disembarked. The steamer arrived about 20 minutes after midnight and left at 3 A. M. and was on the move, before 1 reached the shore. 5. In the afternoon on Friday, I visited the Sheikh ; I quite expected, as f have said above that I should find that the Sheikh’s instructions to the Assistant Surgeon had been misunderstood I opened the conversation by remarking that I should be glad if the Sheikh would be so good as to tell me the tenour of his instructions to the Assistant Surgeon which had astonished me considerably. The Sheikh asked me what the Assistant Surgeon had reported, and I told him the substance of the report that l had the honour to submit to you with my letter quoted above. The Sheikh replied that the Assistant Surgeon’s report was correct in every particular, and added that he had written to the steamer authorities io Bombay to say that quarantine was imposed on all fast mail steamers, and that therefore they should no longer book passengers to Koweit by those steamers. 6. I remarked that the passengers from this fast ma‘I had been landed and had not gone to Basra. The Sheikh began to tell me that they had not been landed , when I cut him short byremarking that 1 was on the steamer and saw them being disembarked. He then said that it was not in his boats, and I did not think it worth while to point out that there were only three boats alongside the steamer, while I was there; that one of these was my own which naturally carried no passengers, and that the first boat after mine into which I saw a number of Indian passengers being disembarked had carried one of his principal customs- officers to the steamer. The Sheikh then added that he detained all the pas sengers until noon on Thursday in the boat harbour. As the passengers for the most part belonged to a gang of Indian boatmen who have come to look after a wrecked dinghy, subsequent enquiries have served to confirm my first impres sion that this statement was utterly false. The passengers were seen by two natives of India in a coffee-shop in the bazar early on Thursday. 7. The Sheikh then began to lay down his views about quarantine generally and brought out the fatalistic saying that he had already quoted in his letter to your address,, forwarded with my No. 334, dated 24th’June 1908, “ Mash’Allah yakun wa ma lam usha lam yakun.” I countered with the equally well known Muhammadan tradition which I described as the father of all quarantine theories ' To the place in which there is sickness, go not; and, if sickness comes upon you, flee not. “ I showed the Sheikh that, in strict obedience to pure Muham madan tradition, no sound Muhammadan should visit either Bombay or Karachi and that our quarantine was merely an endeavour to carry out the spirit of that tradition, while not observing, in all its destructive strictness, the letter. 8. The Sheikh replied admitting the tradition, that, on the whole, he preferred the le tter and that he and his people would be inclined to do without Bombay and Karachi altogether, if going to those places meant rules and regulations. They were all for freedom, a truly audacious statement from such a despot. He then asked about the slow mails, and I said that it seemed, so far as l had seen, unnecessarv to place any restrictions on them, as it w^as barely possible for passengers to land before noon on Thursdays, by which time they would have completed the five days’ passage from the last infected port, but, that, if the Sneikh wished, they should, in the strict interpretation of the Paris Convention, be detained until noon and examined by a competent medical officer; that, in the event of sickness at Bahrein or Bushire, a longer detention would be necessary. The Sheikh then said that, if quarantine was essential, they would do without the slow steamers also. 9. I also asked what would be done to prevent people from the shore land ing on ships under quarantine, and the Sheikh said that he would not send boats and that we could arrange to get our post and transact our business, and thathis own people and boats would not go to the mail boat. I stated that, of course, we should strictly observe the Sheikh’s orders and transact our business from the ladder, and the Sheikh replied that we were at perfect liberty to act in any manner that we thought fit. 10. I would like to state that, however acrimonious this discussion may appear on paper, nothing could exceed the pleasant good humour and politeness with which it was dicussed. The Sheikh’s manner was perfect, and I did my best to respond. 11. It is evident, I venture to think, that the Sheikh is trying to forestall us in^ our threat to discontinue steamers coming to Koweit by showing that he is in no need of steamers and that his one notion of quarantine is to make it useless for the steamers, to come here, if we determine to establish quarantine. I fear that, short of the course that I had the honour to propose in paragraph 5 of my letter, dated 22nd April 1908, No. 197—and there is no disguising the pro bability that it might be necessary to back our proposals for quarantine with a show of force—the only feasible method of inducing the Sheikh to establish quarantine is, as foreshadowed in your letter No. 1802, dated 7th of June, to the address of the Foreign Secretary, to show him that we are really in earnest and that, until he conforms to civilised methods of administration, we intend to stop all steamer communication with Koweit. A visit from one of the Hamburg- Amerika liners would seem to be a peculiarly appropriate occasion for our show of force. But, from my limited and local point of view, with the utmost respect, 1 regard with grave apprehension the barest possibility of our steamers returning ignominiously in the tail of the Hamburg-Amerika. The effect on local opinion wmuld be disastrous and a perfect triumph for Sheikh Mubarak. No. 386, dated Koweit, the 12th July 1908. From—MAJOR S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To-— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith copies 1. Copy of a letter No. 376, dated 8th July 1908, from the Political Agent, Koweit, to the Commander of S. S. “Dumra ” 2. Copy of a letter, dated &lt;ith July 1908, from the Commander S.

' Dumra” to this port was dealt with. 2. I may add that the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Agent also received intimation from the Sheikh that boats would not be sent to bring passengers to the shore. 3. It is clear that the Sheikh has no intention of enforcing quarantine of any kind and that the only action he has taken, if indeed he has done so (for it is now impossible for me to place any relience whatever on any of his state ments in regard to quarantine) has been to write to the British India Company to order ! them not to send passengers to Koweit by the fast mail, thereby deliberately attempting to inflict direct loss on a British Company. 4 He aggravates this contumacy by open and shameless duplicity, as it is impossible to believe that the passengers are brought ashore in defiance of his instructions, and his officers, in reply to Captain Cole's and the Assistant Sur geon's remonstrances, stated clearly that they had received no orders whatever from the Sheikh on the subject.

I shall be obliged if you will kindly render any assistance possible to the Sheikh’s men in enforcing the Sheikh’s orders and also inform the Quarantine Medical Officer whether, to the best of your knowledge and belief, any passengers have managed to disembark at Koweit. 3. The Sheikh further desires that no persons except intending passengers be allowed to board the steamer, the Quarantine Officer of course being an ex- .ception as usual. Copy of a Utter, dated the 8th Julv 1908, from the Commander S. S. “ Dumra ” to the Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 376 of 1908. Three passengers were booked for Koweit and disembarked before the arrival of the Quarantine Officer and the Sheikh’s man. I requested the Sheikh's man to have the passengers sent on board again, but he said he could not do so. Quarantine Report. Koweit, gth July 1908. &gt; S. S. “ Dumra ” arrived here yesterday evening at about 8 P.M. I saw Sheikh Mubarak on Tuesday the 7th instant to receive instructions from him regarding quarantine. He said that as there was to be quarantine in Koweit, the passengers for Koweit would no 1 be allowed to land in Koweit, but would be taken to Basra or Mohammerah. He also said that there w r as no necessity Jor me to go on board the ship, and that i - &lt;n had been already sent to 3 c. ay about two weeks ago that passenger coming by the fast mail would not be allowed to land in Koweit, but would be taken to Moham merah or Basra instead. Karachi was declared to be an unclean port. Under instructions from the Political Agent, I went on board the ship, and found that the passengers for Koweit were ^taken in the Sheikh’s boat to be landed on shore. I informed Captain Cole, the Commander of the vessel that recent instructions from the Sheikh were to the effect that passengers for Koweit should not be allowed to land in Koweit, but should be taken to Mohammerah or Basra instead. The Commander of the vessel told me that he could not help it, as the Sheikh’s men had taken them in their boat. ^ He said that if it was the Sheikh’s order not to allow the passengers to land in Koweit, his own men ought not to have taken the passengers in their boat to land them on shore. Some people from the shore were seen to have boarded the steamer, and did not observe quarantine restrictions.

In ray opinion this is still the position,from the politicai is being repeated to them. So long^the Political and Qjaaran- course, it seems reasonable to atquiesce to the call of a opening so take the line directed in my telegram of 19th May and inform him that the Government of India will doubtless poin^ Oa &gt; i&amp;Ai au all events. The British India Company were asked to suspend tpe visit of the fast mail and this requestt,hao he really has made arrangement/S ho inshihuhe a more effective quarantine than he has hitherto agreed to apply. In the meanwhile you should lose no opportunity of working such friendly influence over him as will facilitate a satis factory arrangement being made when the time comes.

V.’ith reference to your demi-official letter of Sth November s I enclose a copy of a note by McConaghy. I don f t know how far it may be possible for you to get the Sheikh to co-operate in the directions which he (R.s.) advocates. In any case it would be worth while asking British India Agent to get ins tructions issued to Commanders to keep their gang ways up until after medical visit. Captain W.H.I.Shakespear, Political Agent,kushire, lf!th Kov.‘*°10 ’Vi tin refor^nco to the Quarantine Report ^rom Koweit. I think that the Assistant Surgeon shouli he told that in the event of his arriving another time at a ship which is in quarantine and finds that people from the shore have boarded her 'or that nassen- gers have left, that any persona who have come on board should not be allowed to leave the ship until the quarantine period is finished: in case the ship had to leave before the time was up these people should have to be kept in quarantine in theidown boats under quarantine guards. Any passengers who may have left before the inspection, should be made to report to the Q.M.O. and kept in quarantine to the end or the quarantine time, T Captain Shakespear ™ight again ask the Sheikh to issue strict orders forbidding boats arriving at the ships before the medical officer anl in every case boats should wait until the inspection of the ship is finished, when a signal might be given such as one blast from the steam siren which would mean that the ship was given pratique and people could come on board. In the case of ship being in quarantine two blasts would be given and then if i t was necessary to alio?/ coolies or board to work cargo their number should be ascertained and after the ship left, they and any passengers would be kept in quarantine until the period ter- minuted. Possibly the Sheikh might be persuaded to impose a small fine on all offenders against quarantine. Would it be worth while asking hessrs Cray Paul $ Co., here to instruct their Captains that when they go to ^oweit and the ships are in quarantine to prevent people coming on board p rom the shore before the medical officer has boarded the ship, also to prevent any passengers leaving the ship. If the ships’ Cap tains helped it might make matters easier at Koweit.
