My dear Parkinson, I tried to telephone to you yesterday evening and this morning to discuss the question of the proposed message from fhe Xing to the Imm which was dealt with vr* ‘ letter no# 37957/34 of January 18th/, hut in .Blaster's as I have not been able to catch you, Cowell has suggest* ed that 2 should send you a line explaining our point of view. S. I ought to begin by explaining that we fully realise the possible advantages of the proposed message, and appreciate your anxiety to accept the advice of the man on the spot, unless there is some extremely strong reason to the contrary - particularly In view of the sound judgment which Be illy has ao often shown in the past. i:e appreciate also the desirability A.C.C. Parkinson, asq*,C.M.&amp;., 0#B* , Colonial Office. of...»*8 of making the most of any settlement with the Imam anfl doing whatever may be possible to make sure that he accepts that settlement in the right spirit, ana that it does really bring about satisfactory relations. 3# On the other hand, we are extremely anxious that nothing should be clone which might have the effect of diminishing the value and importance of royal messages in future* and we feel very strongly that on grounds of general principle the multiplication of messages from Tha King should be avoided, and the occasions when such messages are sent reduced to an absolute minimus. .. .b far as we can see* it would be quite a new departure to send a message of this kind from The King on the ©on clue Ion oi the treaty now under negotiation, lio each message was sent on the cone1usi&gt;n of the Treaty of Jedda with King Ibn baud in 1987* nor, as far as I can see* on the conclusion of any of our other recent Middle Eastern treaties. Is there not some danger that if we single out the Imam for*•«...Majesty..*., for special treatment in this matter, it he very difficult not to send similar messages on the conclusion of possibly more important treaties in future, and that we may find that we have ere atea a precedent which will be vury emfearraesing? 4. I 1 he fact that no message was sent to Ibu Saud on the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda may also make it a little invidious to send this message to the Imam at a moment when his relations with Ibn baud are so strained. Indeed, our latest information from Jedda (coles of which will be sent to you as soon as possible) suggests that hostilities are again very imminent, if they have not actually broken out. This point could, however, perhaps be met by Instructing Beilly not to transmit the proposed message if when it arrived / / hostilities with Xbn Scud were actually in progress. 5. In all these circumstances ray higher authorities hero consider that, on the balance, it would be better, notwithstanding Be illy * s recommendation, not to ask HisMajesty to send the proposed message. They recognise, howeTer, that in this case the Colonial Office mast have the deciding voice, and they are therefore pre pared to agree to the suggestion being put to The Ting if you still feel strongly that this is the right course. In that event, however, we hope that you may be willing to put the suggestion to Sir Clive digram rather more tentatively anc rather less in the form of a definite recommendation. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to aalthwait© at the India Office. (Signed) Gr*W. RENDEL.37957/34 My dear Laithwaite, sent yon yesterday a copy of a telegram from Aden giving the latest position of the negotiations with the Imam, and yon will remember that in that telegram Reilly asks whether a short personal message conld be sent by the King for delivery to the Imam immediately after the signatnre of the Treaty. I enclose a draft of a letter to Sir Clive Wigram enquiring whether the King will ggree to such a message being delivered. Would you kindly let me know, as early as possible to-morrow, that the India Office see no objection to the action proposed. 37957/34 Tours sincerely INDIA OFFICE £ 0 JAN 1934DRAFT. COLOm THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR CLIVE SI GRAM, G.C.B,, G.C.V.O., C.S.l. Downing Street, January, 1934* Negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty with the object of regularising relations between His Majesty* a Government in the United Kingdom and the Imam of the Yemen have been proceeding for many years and, towards the end of 1933, matters had reached a sufficiency advanced stag© to justify the despatch of a mission to Sanaa, the Imam’s capital, to conclude these negotiations. The Resident at Aden, Lieutenant~Colonel B*H. Heilly, is in charge of the mission and has full powers from Hi® Majesty to sign a treatytreaty on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United kingdom and the Government of India, H ' e have just received a telegram from the Resident, from which it appears that he expects to he in a position to sign the treaty in the course of the next day or two, if all goes well; and he asks whether it will be possible for Hi® Majesty to send a short personal message to the Imam as King of the Xemen immediately after signature* I should perhaps explain that the Imam is the head of the Zeidi sect of Islam and the ruler of a large territory in south-west Arabia immediately north of the Aden Protec torate* The Yemen was under the Turks from 1371-1918 and the boundary between that territory and the Aden ProtectorateProtectorate was delineated with the Turks and embodied in a Convention signed in 1914. On the evacuation of the Yemen by the Turks after the Armistice their place was taken by the Imam, who has ever since raised difficulties about the Anglo-Turkish boundary and has, in fact, occupied certain portions of the Protectorate* One of the conditions pre requisite to the signing of a treaty is that certain Protectorate territory which the Imam has occupied should be evacuated, and the .Resident reports in his telegram that the Imam has expressed his willingness to commence the evacuation of the occupied areas on the 18th of January. The Resident’s view is that nothing could be more gratifying to the Imam or more likely to remove any feeling of loss of prestige involved in the evacuationI evacuation of territory and to strengthen personal friendly relations, than the receipt of a message from His Majesty, X*ord Plymouth things that it would assist our future relations with the Imam if the Besident*s suggestion could he adopted, and after reference to the Foreign Office and the India Office, he would suggest that the message might he on the following lines; 'X have learned with great pleasure that a treaty with your Majesty has been signed on my behalf by my Plenipotentiary, Lieutenant^Colonel Beilly• I feel confident that the successful conclusion of this treaty will strengthen the ties of friendship between our two countries'.I should “be very glad to know whether His Majesty would he willing that such a message should he delivered to the imam by Lieutenant** Colonel Eeilly after the signature of the treaty. If Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly’s expectations are fulfilled, there is not much time before the message will be required, especially as we have no direct communication with him while he is at Sanaa; X should be grateful for an early reply to this letter. mmam6. In these circumstances you may perhaps think it well to enquire by telegraph from Reilly what he is doing on this point, and if you like to suggest that he should try to obtain at any rate a written assurance in the sense indicated in the preceding sragraph we should of course have no objection. 7.

The British Mission arrived at Sanaa on 18th December receiving a very good reception. It was reported on 30th December (P.Z.118/34 with Mr.Laithwaite’s note) that agreement had been reached on the whole treaty with the exception of two points (on which Colonel Reilly was later authorized to give way, if necessary) and^rticle 7 which merely deals with the question of ratification. The Imam also agiesd to an exchange of notes after signature of the Treaty confirming his willingness to co-operate in the suppression of the slave trade (P.Z.311/34)• Colonel Reilly now reports however that the position is not now so satisfactory as it/it was. The Treaty terms have been agreed, hut the Imam is making difficulties about the position of the Aden Protectorate Boundary. It will he remembered that the restoration and surrender of territories and subjects of the Aden Protectorate Chiefs is a necessary pre-condition of the signature of a Treaty, and the Imam was informed in this sense. If the Imam and Bin Saud agree too quickly to a ■ peaceful settlement of the Najran question (perhaps on the lines suggested in Colonel Reilly’s telegram) it will probably react unfavourably on our own negotiations with the Yemen. The Saudis have been taking a somewhat uneasy interest in these (Anglo-Yemen) negotiations. 7^ L- -tya*t ir\Ast~ Cf c&gt;yy ^ ^ ^ if z 7 ^ # B ' ,2b J?

Under your instructions I have several times expressed the hope that the Imam will reach peaceful settlement with Ibn Sand, and the Foreign Minister Ragheb Bey stated yesterday that telegraphic negotiations between them are progressing. He did not give details but I hear from separate source that it is proposed that the Imam should evacuate lie jran where Yemen troops have lately suffered defeats by Beni Yam on the understanding that it will remain neutral territoiy, and that lim Sand should evacuate Beni Ualek on similar condition, final definition of the whole frontier being left for future decision as in proposed Anglo-Yemen Treaty. Position of the Anglo-Yemen negotiations is not as satisfactoiy as it was. Treaty terms have been agreed and the Imam has repeated his willingness to fulfil the conditions of the admonitory document but he is questioning correctness of line to ?/hich British ultimatum of October last compelled him to retire in Western Subeihi area alleging incorrectly that it differs fron the old Anglo-Turkish Boundary. He also disputes the justice of our inclusion of Masabis in district covered by our Treaty with Bekhan.

The first deals at length with legal aspect of Ibn Saud’s sovereignty over Asir and with question of recognition. It then describes present situation and important part played there in by Asir. The second deals with suggested conversations and says Italian Government are grateful to His Majesty’s Government for having so promptly agreed to conversations which they for their part are prepared to begin. Programme of conversations is described as being joint examination of events since last Rome conversations and situation which has now developed. Asir for further reasons which are given in detail is included amongst such events. The third note seeks to show that Saudi-Yemen situation cannot fail to be affected by Resident’s visit to Sanaa which nevertheless Italian Government hope will prove useful and effective. Notes are enclosed in a personal letter to me from Signor Suvich emphasising importance attached by Signor Mussolini to the question and expressing the hope that Anglo-Italian co operation in Arabia will have favourable repercussion on such co-operation elsewhere.

I have the impression that Italians while not wishing to abandon their point of view in regard to Asir and anxious to discuss it with us arc strongly in favour of holding conversa tions v/ith a view to arriving if possible at a com,ion policy. In the meantime their insistence on great importance of Asir to Imam seems to be belied by events (see Jedda telegram No. 826 of April 19th) but this by itself would scarcely render discussions unprofitable and on general grounds I hope it will be possible for a representative of your department to come out at the end of January.38180/34 CYPR&amp;tf TEL&amp;GRiiM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident at Aden. (Sent 8.40 p„m«, 3rd January, 1930 Important. No= 3 Secret. Following for Reilly begins; - 1. Anti Slavery Society have enquired whether it is intended to include Slavery Article in proposed Treaty with Imam. 2. League of Nations Committee of Experts sitting at Geneva in 1932 recommended that every European Power making treaty with any Arab State or Sultanate should endeavour to obtain insertion of a clause to abolish slavery. Cony oi their report was sent to Aden in my circular despatch of 28th November„ 1932. It is important that His Majesty’s Government should make every reasonable effort to comply wx.il this recommendation. 3. During Clayton negotiations in 1926 Imam was prepared to include in treaty article stating that he would by every possible means assist His Majesty’s Government m their endeavours to prevent the African slave trade by sea (see Annexura 8 to Clayton’s report) . 4. His Majesty’s Government do not consider that conclusion of present treaty (main object of which is uo regularise position of frontier) should be made aepenaent upon insertion of article relating to slavery. But principj ^ involved is of real importance and short of actual the conclusion of treaty a risk which of course we a*© mosu anxious to avoid you should endeavour to secure reinset of this provision, or alternatively of provision correspondii g to article 7 of Treaty of Jedda of 1927 with King Xbn Saud, by which latter undertook to 'co-operate by all the means athis diapoual with His Britannic Majesty in the suppresfilon of the slave trade’*, either by article in body of treaty, or if Imam should strongly prefer it by separate exchange of notes o 5. If you have not yet informed Imam of willingness of His Majesty’s Government to remove embargo on export of arms if treaty is concluded (see paragraph ^ of my secret despatch of 2Uth November) you may think it possible to utilise this concession with a view to securing exchange of notes or treaty article as suggested above. I do not wish however to press this if you consider that it would further complicate your task. 6. I should be glad if you could reply to this telegram at early date as no answer is being sent to Society in meantime.ivt I- V77uv&lt; wx^r^sr • (/y^. v\Xj^ T j F® dUVMCAdV'r? fb^-&lt; 0 tAL 7^ 5 t The telegram attached reports the progress of w -'-' t ' :i ^ e Ihiam* Broadly speaking, the position appears to he at this stage more satisfactory than might V i have been hoped. 2. As regards the amendments for which the Imam is pressing, and to which Colonel Reilly's telegram refers, it will he remembered that after considerable preliminary discussion H.M.G. put forward to the Tm»m the treaty enclosed in Colonial Office despatch of 14th April 1932, flagged. The Imam replied hy the counter-treaty contained in Colonial Office despatch of 12th July 1933, also flagged. H.M.G. were not prepared to accept the Imam's various amendments as they stood, and their instructions to Colonel Reilly as to the line to he adopted hy him are contained in Colonial Office despatch of 20th November 1933, on P.Z.7549/33 attached. 3. Of the amendments now in dispute, the proposed amendment in respect of ,, merchant M ships does not appear (subject to the views of the Foreign Office and possibly the Board of Trade) to he of any substantial importance. 4. The second amendment Hhe southern frontier of the Yemen'* is more material. The Imam prefers a vague claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the whole of South-western Arabia, including the Aden Protectorate and the iiden settlement, and we, anxious to 4o nothing in the treaty which will constitute a recognition on our part of any such claim. It is for this reason that in the counter draft communicated to the ResidentCby^the Colonial Office on 14th April 1932, Article 3 was worded to run 'The settlement of the question of the southern frontier of the territories of H.M. the King of the Yemen is deferred pending the conclusion.. .of the negotiations which shall 11 li I2 take place between them before the expiry of tile period of the present treaty.” This was in substitution for the phrase ’’southern Yemen territories” which had been proposed by the Imam. The objections to that phrase are developed in Mr. Rendel's remarks on pages 4 and 5 of the Minutes of the Middle East Committee of 7th torch 1933, on P.Z.1482/33, flagged. The Imam, in the counter-draft which he submitted in June 1933, amended the opening paragraph of Article 3 to read ’’The settlement of the question of the southern frontier is deferred pending the conclusion of the negotiations, etc.”, explaining that he considered the phrase 'of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen' to be superfluous and unnecessary 'because this treaty that is being concluded basically concerns the territories of the Yemen. The text of the treaty has no concern with other than the Yemen and Great Britain.' The Middle East Committee, however, held to the view that the Imam should be required to accept our wording. 5. It is primarily for the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office to- advise on this matter, but our concurrence will also be required in any instructions to be sent. The Resident is clearly rather inclined to accept the words 'southern frontier of the Yemen' now proposed by the Imam, his reasons being that the article as drafted makes it clear that the land boundary with the Aden Protectorate is meant and that, as he explained in 1931, the term 'Yemen' while in the geographical sense it is widely accepted as comprising the whole of ttre south-western Arabia, in the restricted or political sense can be regarded 'as applying only to the actual territory of/- 3 - of tlie laiam, and it is presumably in this sense that H.M.G. have offered to recognise the Imam as King of the Yemen...It seems clear that the Imam, like H.M.G., was referring to a land frontier, if so, the point is not of great importance...'a f &amp; . 1 1^34 j CYPHEB TELSGPu^ from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary \ of State for the Colonies. Dated 30th December, 1933. (received, Colonial Office, IP.30 a.m., 30th December, 1933.) No. 84. Following from Colonel Reilly position of negotiations is as follows:- with two exceptions, agreemert has been reached on whole treaty except'/ U-ticltr 7 or terms authorised by your instructions and the Imam has so far mace no reference to secret appendix. Two exceptions are firsi in Article 3 Imam will only accept words 'Southern frontier of Yemen' and not fuller phrase required in your memorandum which he maintains is inappropriate to position of Imam as elected ruler -and not hereditory owner of territory in question and is dangerous to his prestige and soverign interest. I am, reluctant to embark: on further arguments regarding this Ar' id! which has for many years been principal stumbling block to the treaty unless point at issue is vital. In my opinion words preferred by Imam are acceptable for reason stated in paragraph 3 (a) of my despatch No. 208 dated 21st October 1931 and because it is also evident from, three references to frc ati&lt; in second part of same Article that land boundary with Adei Protectorate is meant. Second exception is that in Article 5 (3) (c) Imam wishes to insert word 'merchant' in definitioi of vessels. He explains that his Treaties v/ith other European 'T Powers include clauses similar to Article 5 (2) which are understood to refer only to merchant vessels and that he 'ear! that if he accepts ?/ider interpretation in British Treaty othei Governments will demand revision in same sense. I assume from context that Article in question refer? to merchant vessels and I propose therefore to assent to insertion of words 'merchant' in definition. Do you agree regarding these two points?

Following from Colonel Reilly position of negotiations is as follows:- with two exceptions agreement has been reached on whole treaty except Article 7 on terms authorised by your instructions and the Imam has so far made no reference to secret appendix. Two exceptions are first in Article 3 Imam will only accept words 'Southern frontier of Yemen' and not fuller phrase required in your memorandum which he maintains is inappropriate to position of Imam as elected ruler and not hereditory owner of territory in question and is dangerous to his prestige and soverign interest. I am reluctant to embark on further arguments regarding this Article which has for many years been principal stumbling block to the treaty unless point at issue is vital. In my opinion words preferred by Imam are acceptable for reason stated in paragraph 2 (a) of my despatch No. 208 dated 21st October 1931 and because it is also evident from three references to frontier in second part of same Article that land boundary with Aden Protectorate is meant. Second exception is that in Article 5 (3) (c) Imam wishes to insert word 'merchant' in definition of vessels. He explains that his Treaties with other European Powers include clauses similar to Article 5 (2) which are understood to refer only to merchant vessels and that he fears that if he accepts wider interpretation in British Treaty other Governments will demand revision in same sense.

It will be recalled that during Sir Gilbert Clayton’s negotiations at Sanaa in 1926 the Imam of the Yemen was at that time prepared to include in the Treaty an article stating that he would, by every means possible, assist His Britannic Majesty’s Government in their endeavours to prevent the African slave trade by sea.

JliQiMt,* IStli Hovaittoer 1933* (Mir d©ar Fmd Bay), Yon will recollect tlsai at our meeting on the 12tn Hovcmher yon mentioned certain rumours current here that aeroplane© had recently been employed 'by the authorities at Aden to bomb certain centres in the Yemen, a report I wae able to deny to Your xcellency, I am now happy to be able to give you, upon instructions from my Government, in greater detail the following particulars for the information of the a’Gdi Arab Government relating to the present situation between His Majesty 1 © Government in the United Kingdom and the Imim Yehya of the Yemen. It will doubtless be within your knowledge that for a considerable time His Maje©ty # s Government in the United Kingdom have been in negotiation with the Imim Yahye with m view to the conclusion of a general treaty friendship, the main objects of such a treaty would be to regularise the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, to secure the evacuation by the Imim Yahys of Protectorate territory ©till in hi© occupation and also to reduce the risk of further frontier incidents and incursions by the Imam into the Protectorate, wnich have made it necessary for His Majesty's Government to threaten to take air action against him* As a result of these prolonged negotiations, His Majesty’* Government in April last informed the Xmim of lis r xcellency, Fuad bey Hamza, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. /thethe terms to which they were ready to agree and in July the latter replied that he was prepared to accept the terms put forward, subject to certain minor modifications. The question has since 'been under further discussion with His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden, whilst he was on leave this summer ami it was decided that upon his return to Aden he should be authorised to continue negotiations with the Imim on the above basis and to visit Lan'a for the purpose. Colonel Reilly has therefore now bwa authorised to Inform the Xrnim Yahya that he will be ready to proceed to Ban’s in order to endeavour to conclude the treaty as soon as the Imlm is able to receive him. This proposed visit cannot however take place for four or five weeks yet a&amp; Colonel Reilly must await the Xalm's reply and, as Your Excellency will realise, communications are slow and difficult. X am therefore desirous of Mking it clear that the duelcion of His Majesty’s Government to authorlee His Majesty’s Chief 'oraml as loner to proceed to San*® is thus entirely independent of recent political developments in Arabia and I would especially desire to emphasise that the sole and only objects of His Majesty 1 e Government la continuing these negotiations with the ImBm are, as I have indicated earlier in this letter, to settle the frontier question, to secure the evacuation of Protectorate territory still in Yemeni occupation and for the future to ensure the immunity of the . rotectorate from further encroachments on its territory* I would finally like to seise this opportunity to assure Your Excellency that the action His Majesty’s Government now proposes to fake with the Yemen will in no way affect their /attitudeattitude towards the ba # fidi Arab Ctevernmimt aor will thair disposition towards the Government of His Kim Abdul ’Axi^ be any less friendly and cordial than before. On the contrary they fervently trust that through the establishment of relations with the Imim Yahya they may be able to use their influence to persuade him to adopt a more conciliatory and a more peaceful attitude in regard to the present dispute between him and His Majesty King Abdul ’Asia, should direct negotiations on this dispute between the two Eulers have failed to bring about an improvement in the situation by that time.

In fact, it appears that, following- on an invitation from the Imam Yahia, a special British mission directed by Colonel B.R. Reilly, the Political Resident in Aden, is about to leave for Sanaa, the capital of the Yemen, with the object of negotiating with the Imam a treaty which is intended to settle all outstanding questions between the Yemen and the British Government. That the Yemeni king should have taken such an initiative suggests that the Imam Yahia, in the course of his preparations to face Ibn Saud with all his forces, wishesto secure for himself the friendly neutrality of Great Britain by removing the smallest possible cause of friction.mmgmm J'f P.2 0 699^63.

This failure was due partly to a lack of co-operation on the part of the AudhaXi# themselves, and partly to the Inadequate air forces then available at Aden. 5. Hostilities were auspended in 1926 and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton was sent to Sanaa (the Imam 4 # capital), where he endeavoured to negotiate a treaty with the Xmnm, but the negotiations broke down on the question of evacuation of the occupied Protectorate Territory. 6. Early in 192? a serious warning was given to the Imam, through the Hesldent at Aden, that his occupationoeeujmfcioii of part of the Aden Fro to rate rendered him tinhle at any time to each measures of retaliation by land, air, or Mm, at auoh time and in m®h manner as His Mxn4®sty's Cloirsrnmtnt in the United Kingdom might deem suitable* The lmm%*» reply to this warning me pacific, nnd included nn offer to resume nerotiations for a treaty* It ms eventually decided to pumme the method of negotiation, but to make the evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory m prerequisite to the signing of any treaty* 7. In spite of this decision, it was found necessary in 1928 to take air action against the Xsuun in the X%al&amp; area as a resuSt of the kidnapping of two Protectorate Sheikhs by &amp;eldl forces* Various toms in t@m®n territory were bombed, as also were the frontier garrisons; the Protectorate tribes assisted, and in two month® the whole of the Dhala area was evacuated by the 2aidle except for a small piece of territory in the vicinity of Sanaa ( see my predecessor's telegram Circular B. Ifo.28 of the 14th April, 1928)t o i#V.S*on!y)©f which a copy was anole^wd in his secret despatch of the 16th April, 1928*) (mil) 8. Small incurclonss have occurred at other points, e*g*. the AX Ain area in the Borth-east of the Proteotorate, when a threat of bombing was resorted to, and this proved sufficient to Induce the Keidi forces to withdraw, 9*9.

These oonolusiona are aet oat in the aooompanying note and the Resident at Aden should be guided by them in his forthcoming negotiations with the Imam. It has been decided that the Government of India shall be a party to the Treaty and it will therefore be neoessary to amend the preamble as follows: - 'Have reeolyea to oonolude this Treaty and hay© appointed as their plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Great Britain and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India: For Great Britain and Northern Ireland: For India: His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam. ARTICLE I.ARTICLE I. The Imam wishes to insert the words 'and his Government' in this artiole after both 'His Majesty the King of Great Britain eto.' and 'His Majesty the King of the Yemen.” There are serious objections to inserting either in the body of the Treaty or in any formal exchange of notes to be attaohed to it, any specifics statement to the effect that the Treaty will be applicable to the Governments of the High Oontraoting Parties, since the effect of such a statement might well be to throw doubt on whether other treaties with Arabian rulers made in the names of the Heads of States alone would in fact remain binding on the Governments of the States concerned. There can in fact, and in law, be no doubt that a treaty between Heads of States binds them, chair sucoassors, their Governments and succeeding Governments. The Head of the State in concluding a treaty contracts on behalf of, and binds, the State as a whole, aa an entity, and no distinction between him and hie Government exists in the matter. it would therefore be in the highest degree undesirable to admit eTen ^ implication that any such distinction could validly be drawn either in the case of His Majesty or of -she Imam. Were His Majesty's Government now to acquiesce in the Imam's demand that any of His Majesty's Governments should be specified in terms either in the Treaty or m notes to be attached to it, as being bound by the Treaty as well as The King himself, it is possible that other Governments might raise similar questions in connexionconnexion with existing treaties, particularly those with other Arabian rulers. On the other hand, if, through ignorance of international law and practice in this matter, the Imam requires some special reassurance on this point, the Resident is authorised to address a note to the Imam in Um ‘ : * kerms of the attached draft, provided that it is mado r&amp;so j,u tely clear to the Imam that this note does not impose Eny obligation on either party additional to that contain el in the text of the treaty, or indeed add anything at all to what will in any event be the effect of the treaty, out that it is merely a document intended to explain what, according to established law and practice, is the meaning and effect of any treaty to which His Majesty, as Heat of the State, is a party on behalf of the • mi Leo .kingdom and indie, vis • that it is necessarily binding on His Majesty T s Government in the United i.-.u_i' 3 uom c*nd Bor ohern Xrelaao., end upon the Government of India, ARTICLE III. The Imam wishes to omit the words T! of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen”* F 0 r Reasons which have been fully explained in previous voiiespcndence it is essential that these words should te reinserted and. the Resident should insist on this, ii s -jorrnexion attention is invited to the views expressed by the Foreign Office representative at the noting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee meeting on March 7 th* Y ji.r.eI 1 he Imam has omitted the words 'fcy persons under their proteotion”» The Imam T e omissi on tti- V ' be aooepted or alternatively the words K by their su.bj; or t? may also he omitted if the Imam so desires.

Unless, therefore, uhsre is reason to believe that the Imam desires the omissionomission oi these words in order to aToid some ofc.llgatio under the Treaty, the Resident may agree to the proposed omission. In paragraphs 1 and 2 the Im&amp;tn has suhst itu % che phrase 7, eaoh of the High Contracting Parties” for the phrase f, one High Contracting Party”, This amendmer may he accepted. ±n paragraph x the Imam has inserted, tho words 'and judgments” for the words 'local laws'. Thi Resident should ask the Imam to explain why he made this insertion, and if the Resident is satisfied that the reasons* are innocuous, he may agree to the, insertion of some phrase such as the Imam suggests. Hie Majesty*r Government are advised, however, that it would be preferable that the words 'and courts' or 'and tribimsir 5 should be used rather than 'and judgments', as giving effect more accurately to what they understand to be the meaning of the Imam T s proposal. The Imam has omitted the provision in paragrac to the efleot that the subjeots of one High Contracting Party shall receive treatment no less favourable than tha enjoyea by the subjeots of the other High Contrasting Par J’or this, he has substitutea worcls which provide that the subjeots of each of the High Contracting Parties shall receive equal treatment to that enjoyed by the subjects oi most-favoured power; he has, in fact, preserved moat- favoured -nation treatment, but omitted national treatment. His Majesty’s Government consider it preferable that this paragraphparagraph should provide for national as well as most- avouredonation treatment s and the Hesident should endeavour to get the article amended accordingly, hut if he is unable to persuade the Imam to agree ^ this, the Besident may accept the Imam’s proposal, Bef arenas is Invited in this oonneotion tc the leoi' - of State’s secret despatch of the 13 th October, IQ-■' The Imam wishes to omit the whole of iA~ragiaph 0 * ihis paragraph is necessary to ensure. inter alia, that, while the privileges granted in paragraphs 1 and 2 in respec vessels, etc*, apply tc all t of British subjects, British subjects, vess from whaterer part of the British Common? Vr ' -i- lj5 -i 1 of Sations they may oome, the privileges grants! to fmnen snhjaots, vessels, eto*, do net apply in the territories of the Dominions. His MajestySe Sovomniat in the United Kingdom are bound by inter-imperial s tions to endeavour to sooure that in treaties made befee Eis Majesty’s Government in the Unitea Kingdom and i’orei Powers, benefits of the nature of those conferred by Article 7 should be axtended to British subjects and vessels generally, and to mate it clear by definition *a the Treaty that the benefits are ao extended, Paragraph 5 is neoesaary also in order to make it clear that the privileges granted by the Imam apply to all persons under His Majesty's proteotion, that is to inter alios, to inhabitants of the Man Protectorate, His Majesty’s Government must insist, therefore, that this paragraph should be reinserted„ InIn paragraph 2 th* Imam has substituted the words 'in t'he ports of the other n for the words 'in the ports of the territories of the other”* This amendment must he read in oonjunotion with the proposed omission of paragraph 3 * The phrase w in the ports of the other' might possibly be interpreted to include Dominion ports, The phrase 'in the ports of the territories of the other' 7 virtue of the definition of the word 'territories' ton the inclusion of which, as stated above. Hie Majesty 1 Government must insist) cannot be so interpreted* and must for that reason be adopted. The xmam has also omitted the words 'and their passengers' from paragraph 2* The intention in these words is to make it clear that in the case of a vessel % of one of the High Contracting Parties calling at the ports of the other High Contracting Party with passengers of a foreign State on board, those passengers would not receive less favourable treatment in the port Jiaii if those passengers were travelling on a vessel of their own or any other nationality. The inclusion oj these words is intended to secure that passengers a 1 British ships shall not, because they are carried a British ships, be less favourably treated in a port of the Yemen than they would be had they been carried in vessel flying the flag of any other country. These words must, therefore, be retained. ARTICLE vnr. His Majesty’s aovernment’s draft proposes that the English and Arabic texts shall have equal force, whereas the Imam wishes the Arabic text to prevail in casecase of doubt. His Majesty's Government are inclined to think that if the more serious difficulties which the Imam has raised in regard to other articles of the Treaty are successfully overcome by negotiation, it :o unlikely that the Imam will go to the length of refusing to conclude a treaty merely because the langans question remains unsettled. Both in the Treaty of Jadda of 1927 with King Ibn Baud and in the Treaty of Alliance with Iraq of I 930 , It is provided that in case of a divergence between the English and Arabic text of the Treaty, the English text shall prevail, and His Majesty's Government feel that there would hardly be sufficient justification to treat the Imam in this matter more favourably than King Ibn Baud or King Pelsal of Iraq, particularly as to do so would create an unfortunate precedent in a matter which is of oonsidarab importance on grounds of general principles and policy,, ^•or these reasons. His Majesty's Government are not disposed to make a concession on the point of language, but, if the other outstanding questions are all successfully settled and the negotiations appear likely to break down on this issue alone, the Resident should refer by telegraph to His Majesty's Government for further instructions.

The IMAM'S message was a brief oression of thanks. The letter from the Officer Commanding TA'IZ gave point, to the complexity of the inter-tribal territorial uUation on the SUBEIHI border, and in that connection recommended our Lerenee to the Anglo-Turkish boundary map, (with the implication that il jvided an acceptable and satisfactory basis of division).

It is to be hoped that no hitch will now occur, for while the prospects of a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations at Sana may not be very great, the Imam having in the past shown himself definitely disposed to insist on his full demands, Colonel Heilly is an experienced political on icer with great knowledge of this area, and a moment when the imam's relations witn Ibn Baud are as uncertain as at present may well be a good one at which to impress on him the aavantage which he can look to aerive from frienaly relations with h.M.G. h- Mi Wwvfc ’. . , r~ PAHAHIBaSE TEUBGRiiM frc^m the Resident at Aden 1 decretory af State for the Colonies. 7504 Dated 17th November, 1933, 1S33 (Received, Colonial Office, 5.53* p*m* B 17th November'1^953.)

Detailed ins tractions leave by bag tomorrow.THE SUB-COMMITTEE met to consider and advise the Cabinet as to whether the despatch of an envoy to the Court of the Iman of the Yemen at Sanaa, with a view to the con clusion of a Treaty, as approved by the Cabinet on the 5th September, 1933 (Cabinet 50 (33), Conclusion 5), should be del erred or not. The following papers were laid before the meeting - (1) Memorandum by the Colonial Office, circulated on the 05th August, 1933. (Paper No. (M) 25; also C.P. 210 (33)). (2) Letter from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office, dated 28th October, 1933. (Paper No. M.E.(M) 26). (3) Letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, dated 4th November, 1933. (Paper No. M.E.(M) 27). (4) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies summarising the previous papers and the present situation. (Paper No. M.E* (m) 28). SIR JOHN SIMON explained that the Foreign Office did not wish to oppose any decisions which had already been taken, but were only pressing that action on these decisions should be deferred in view of certain new developments. He felt that the following considerations should be put frankly before the Sub-Committee:- The effect of the. proposed visit to Sanaa on - (a) existing relations between the Imam and Ibn Saud; and (b) our general relations with the Italian Government. He considered that advice and pressure by His Majesty's Government might yet succeed in avoiding an out break of hostilities between the Imam and Ibn Saud, and thought that some means might be found of co-operating with the Italian Government in this matter. He thought that the despatch of a mission to Sanaa, 'under present circum stances, would give a wrong impression and confirm Italian suspicions that we were attempting to take advantage of the Imam's troubles. THE CHAIRMAN explained that the situation in the Aden Protectorate was becoming increasingly difficult owing to our failure to come to some arrangement with the Imam. He - 1 -doubted very much whether relations with Ibn Sand would be affected by the despatch of an envoy to Sanaa especially as that envoy would have authority to threaten hostile action against the Imam if he did not evacuate the protec torate territory which he occupies* If anyone was prejudiced by this it would 5 in his opinion, be the Imam, rather than Ibn Baud. He quoted information showing that the Italians had tried in the past to obstruct the con clusion of a Treaty betv/een the Imam and this country. He thought that it was absolutely vital to get a satisfactory Treaty at once, and agreed with the Resident’s opinion that now was the psychological moment. Should the negotiations for a Treaty break down it would be necessary to threaten hostile action, and the possibility of hostilities v/ith the Imam would be more likely to have a serious re-action on the Italians than the conclusion of a Treaty. LORD LONDONDERRY considered that the dilatory measures hitherto adopted to secure the evacuation of our territory by the Imam’s forces had been detrimental to our interests. He pointed out that the proposed Treaty would in no way affect our relations v/ith Ibn Saud. He was, therefore, in favour of continuing negotiations forthwith. LORD HAILSHAM considered that immediate measures should be taken to obtain a Treaty. It was obvious, however, that the Italians did not in any case wish us to conclude a Treaty v/ith the Imam. He suggested that they should be informed that as our common object is to prevent hostilities occurring between the Imam and Ibn Baud, v/e are in the fortunate position of being about to send an envoy to Sanaa, who should bring pressure to bear on the Imam to keep the peace. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL and MR. WAKELY (on behalf of the Secretary of State for India) were both in favour of continuing negotiations.-3- MR. RENDER said that it had 'been agreed that if negotiations at Sanaa failed 9 the Resident should he in a position to issue a virtual ultimatum to the Imam. V/e should thus in the event of failure he committed to forcible action 5 , and this might lead to serious difficulties with the Italians. Secondly* the situation between the Imam and Ibn Saud was most critical and there was reason to believe that the Imam had only been deterred from attacking Ibn Saud by uncertainty as to the atcimide of His Majesty's Government. A friendly gesture such as the despatch of an envoy to Sanaa at this moment might tip the scale and render immediate hostilities inevitable. The Italians were pressing for immediate conversations on Arabian affairs. He suggested that Colonel Reilly's mission to Sanaa should oe deferred until those conversations had taken place. THE CHAIRMAN * however* was of opinion that further delay in the despatch of Colonel Reilly to Sanaa was undesirable and the Committee accepted this view. SIR JOHN SIMON said that should hostilities break out in the immediate future between the Imam and Ibn Saud it might be necessary to reconsider the continuance of our negotiations with the Imam for this Treaty. CONCLUS ION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (l) that having considered the whole position they are satisfied that the advantages of continuing negotiations overweigh the disadvantages* and they accord ingly recommend that the Cabinet should adhere to it^' previous decision.-.4- (2) that the Foreign Office should inform the Italian Government that Colonel Reilly 5 the Resident at Aden* will go to Sanaa* in order to negotiate a Treaty* and that as it is the common object of both the British and Italian Governments to prevent the outbreak of hostilities between the Imam and Ibn Baud* Colonel Reilly will take advantage of his presence at Sanaa to use his best efforts to achieve this object; (3) that should hostilities actually break out between the Imam and Ibn Saud a situation might arise in which it might be necessary to reconsider this decision. 2* Whitehall Gardens* S» W.1. * 14th November* 1933.41 LATIONS OF S MAJESTY’S IE THE IMAM TIE YEMEN. 5 &amp;ty Nego- itions.^ 'evicus ? erence: )inet 6l i) Con- ision 9-) C {v A B I N E T 62 (33) IBth November 1933.

The Foreign Office have since reiterated their objection to any negotiations with the Imam so long as relations between His Highness and Ibn 3aud remain strained (Foreign Office Ltter of 4th November on P.Z.7199). The Colonial Office on the other hano. remain unconvinced by the Foreign Office arguments and it has therefore been decided that the matter should be referred, for a recommendation to the Ministerial Middle East Committee, which is to consider it tomorrow morning at 11.15. It is understood that the Secretary of state will be unable to be present and will be represented by Mr. Wakely. 2* The position is clearly set out in Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister*s memorandum now attached and it is unnecessary to recapitulate the main points or the history of this question. The India Office are less directly concerned than the Foreign Office and Colonial Office, but as the third Political Department represented on the Middle East Committee it is understood that their attitude tomorrow may be of some importance. The Colonial Office case is fully set out in Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister*s memorandum. and I submit that it is on the whole convincing/that we f might, subject to the course of the discussion / in general^ support it. The Foreign Office argument, so far as it is based on the possible reactions on the Italians of immediate negotiation between us and the Imam, seems unconvincing, and there is force in the Colonial Office comment in paragraphs 5 and 9 of the Memorandum. There is more substance in the Foreign Office/I Office argument as to the possibility of misunder standing on the part of Ibn Saud* But it should not be beyond our capacity to make clear to ibn Baud that in pursuing these negotiations we are merely working to a programme which had been arranged before the situation between him and the Imam became strained; and there is of course always the possibility (though this could not well be put to Ibn Baud) that Colonel Reilly might be able to exercise some moderating influence on the Imam’s attitude towards Baudi Arabia. There is finally force in the point taken by the Colonial Office in paragraph S.Tthat the Foreign Office proposal to inform the Imam that the negotiations will be suspended unless he can come to terms with Ibn Baud such as H.M.G. could approve rt would obviously be a breach of our attitude 'towards the two parties to the dispute.lt may be added that it is difficult to understand why action which consists in informing the Imam that unless he concludes a satisfactory treaty we shall take air action to enforce our rights can be said to be favouring the Imam unduly at the expense of Ibn Baud' 1 . 3. From the purely local point of view, while the prospects of a satisfactory outcome to this negotiation if undertaken may not be very good, it would seem a great pity, if this can at all be avoided, to acquiesce at this stage in a further postponement which may be lengthy, and particular reference is connection to the remarks in paragraph&gt; 7fof the Colonial Office memorandum. •lA The F.O. case against immediate negotiations at.Paper. Sana, set out in their letter of 4th Mov. , seems to me extremely unconvincing. They say (a) that Ibn Baud migh interpret such a step as offering the Imam encouragement in his conflict with himself, and (b) that the Italians . might suspect that we were seeking to take advantage of the Imam’s difficulties. The two objections are hardly compatible with one another; if our action really served to encourage the Imam, it could hardly be represented as taking unfair advantage of him. What the F.O. apparently :ear is that the same action may be interpreted in opposite senses in different quarters. But an action which is capable of opposite interpretations is easily defensible in both quarters. We certainly do not want to create an additional cause of friction with Ibn Baud, but, of the two F.O. objections, I- should have thought that there is % even less substance in their fear of Ibn Baud’s reactions than in their fear of the Italians. The C.O. may well c* * ask why negotiation backed by k t hr eat of air action should be thought by Ibn Baud to be favouring the Imam. The F.O.’s ov/n proposal that we should seek to influence the Imam m favour of his agreeing with Ibn Baud is also very hard to reconcile with their scrupulous desire to satisfy the Italians that we are adopting an attitude of impartiality.

Mem orandum by the Se cretar y of State for the Colonies , On the 5th of September the Cabinet had under consideration the question of continuing negotiations for a treaty with the Imam of the Yemen 0 The question had been previously considered by the.Standing Official Sub-Commit tee for Questions concerning the Middle East 3 and the recommendations of that Committee were as follows '(a) That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam| provided the envoy is previously author!sed 9 should the Imam prove obdurate ~ (i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement; that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty's Government will not any longer tolerate the presence of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty's Government claim for the Aden Protectorate; and that if negotiations are broken off 9 His Majesty's Government will in all probability feel compelled to assert forcibly their rights in Audhalio and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces*(ii) To 'break off negotiations,, NOTES In point of faot 5 it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind it will clinch hie negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory 5 hut the envoy must have an assurance that 9 if necessary 5 His Maje sty ? s Gove m~ ment will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the Protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces 5 as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after the negotiations are broken off 0 u) I IusaXa olr+y-irt** Vicc^L*^ That while continuance of negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as a departure 9 in a strict sense 9 from the instructions approved earlier in the year to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had said their last word 5 the Imam’s letter cm. be accepted as a sufficient advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa on his return in the au.tumn 5 for the purpose of concluding a treaty; but that in order that there may be no mis apprehension 5 the Imam must understand that His Majesty’s ^ Government require the trade restrictions to be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Resident’s admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty is actually signed 9 and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss matters of wording in the text of the treaty proposed by the Irnamj the secret annexe^cannot be agreed to in any form 0 That in the event of action becoming, necessary for the recovery of Audhali territory 9 it is essential that authority should be given for bombing 9 .after the usual warnings 9 suitable military objectives within Imamic territory 9 and that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary'. 2. These recommendations are contained in Cabinet Paper^fZbnfrt T$\ 210 (33) of the 30th August, and were approved by the Cabinet on the 5th September, 3. Instructions were sent to the Acting Resides accordingly, and, as soon as tin Resident reached/Aden on his return from leave, he telegraphed (on the 25th October) that he was new proposing to address a letter to the imam accepting his invitation to visit Sanaa, Since the end of August, however, the state of tension between Ibn Baud and the Imam has been increasing, and recently there has appeared to be a serious risk of the outbreak of hostilities between the two Rulers, On the receipt of the Resident’s telegram of tne 25th October, the Foreign Office made urgent representations to the Colonial Office that the Resident should be instructed not to despatch the letter to the Imam until there had been time to consider the developments in the situation. As a result of these representations the Resident was instructed not to despatch his letter to the Imam for the present. Since that date the position has formed the subject of correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office, and on the 4th November the Foreign Office addressed a letter to the Colonial Office in which they set out in detail their objections to the Resident making an immediate visit to Sanaa. 4. The Foreign Office are of opinion that if negotiations' are immediately resumed with the Imam, undesirable reactions will arise in the relations of His Majesty’s Government with King Ibn Saud and the Italian Government, The Foreign Office view is that it would he undesirable from the point of view of Anglo-Saudi relations that the Resident should he conducting treaty negotiations at a time when the Imam was engaged in open hostilities with Ibn Saud. They have substantial reasons for believing that the danger of the4 outbreak of an armed conflict between the Imam and King Ibn Gaud? which now appears so imminent 9 has been brought about by the policy of the Imam rather than that ^ of King Ibn Gaud. In these circumstances, the Foreign Office regard it as inadvisable that His Majesty’s Government should make any advances to the Imam which might be interpreted as offering him encouragement 9 and they consider that the mere fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly was at Sanaa for the purpose of negotiating a treaty settlement while hostilities were actually proceeding would not unnaturally prejudice the impartiality of His Majesty’s Government in the eyes of Ibn Saud 9 and to that extent weaken their influence in dealing with him in the present crisis as well as over matters of more direct mutual con cern. 5. The Foreign Office further contend that in the interest of Anglo-Italian co-operation 9 it is undesirable that we should bring pressure to bear on the Imam at the present time, as the Italians would accuse us of taking advantage of the ImairFs present difficulties. 6. The Foreign Office further contend that hostilities might break out before the Resident reached Sanaa, or while he was in the middle of negotiations, which it would then be difficult to break off. They consider that the present position affords an opportunity to His Majesty’s Government of actually influencing the Imam in favour of agreeing to negotiations with Ibn Saud, and they suggest that the Resident should be instructed to reply to the Imam in the following terms. 'His Majesty’s Government have duly considered the Imam’s letter of the 20th June and are in principle willing to resume negotiations and to/ -4--5- instruct the Resident to visit Sanaa to that end. They have learned ? however, with regretr that there is an imminent possihility of the outbreak of an armed conflict between the Imam and King Ibn Saud„ While wishing to maintain the present fortunate state of relations with both rulers, they consider that it would be open to misunderstanding were they to give to one party at the present juncture so special a mark of their friendly attitude as would be involved in the despatch to Sanaa for the first time after a long interval of a highly placed official. They regret, therefore, that the Resident's visit to Sanaa must be postponed until the situation between the Imam and King Ibn Saud is such so as to preclude the likelihood of hostilities during the stay of the mission at Sanaa. H To The Colonial Office are strongly opposed to the Foreign Office proposal. In his letter of the 20th June the Imam invited the Resident to pro ceed to Sanaa to negotiate a treaty and agreed in jjrinciple to the demand of His Majesty’s Government that he should evacuate the districts of the Aden Protectorate which he now occupies, and should with draw his embargo on Protectorate trade, b efore th e a ctual signature of the tr eaty. This is a most important advance in the Imam’s previous attitude. If there is considerable delay in continuing negotiatioiis, the Imam may again take up a more intransigent attitude and the present propitious moment for obtaining a treaty may pass. Moreover, if His Majesty's Government are unable to obtain the evacuation of the Audhali district and the removal of the tradeembargo-by means of negotiations, they will almost certainly be faced with unrest in the Protectorate leading to incidents which will compel them to take hostile action against the Imaim The jResident has repeatedly informed us that he has only kept the Audhali tribe quiet by assuring them that he was doir.g his best to obtain by negotiation the evacuation of their territory, and if it becomes known trat those attempts are indefinitely suspended^ unrest among the tribe would certainly lead to frontier incidents which could only be followed by hostilities against the Imam* The Foreign Office % would presumably not welcome such hostilities, as they would re-act unfavourably on our relations with the Italians, 8 3 Tie Colonial Office cannot accept the view of the Foreign Office that the despatch of the Resident to Sanaa could only be regarded by Ibn Saud as a direct encouragement to the Imamu The negotiations for a treaty with the Imam have been (as Ibn Baud is aware, or can be informed) in pro- gress fo? a number of years and they are being con tinued a: the present time in the normal course after only such delay as has been necessary owing to the Resident’s absence on leave and discussion of the Imam's proposals among the Departments eoncernedc Moreover, the Colonial Office hold that the Foreign Office proposal to inform the Imam that the negotiations will be suspended unless he can come to terms with Ibn Saud, of which His Majesty's Governmert approve, would obviously be a breach ofour attitude of impartiality towards the two parties to the dispute. It may he added that it is difficult to understand why action which consists in informing the Imam that unless he conclude^ a satisfactory Treaty, we shall take air action to enforce our rights, can he said to he favouring the Imam unduly at the expense of Ibn Saud. 9. We have fully discharged all our ohligations to the Italian Government. We know that the Italian Government wish to prevent us from concluding a Treaty with the Imam« The conclusion of such a Treaty is vital to the Aden Protectorate and conflicts with no legitimate Italian interest. If we sacrifice our own essential interests to Italian susceptihilities now, we shall find it no easier to withstand their claims later; hut we shall find that Italian influence has made the Imam more intractable. 10. In the Colonial Office view it would only he possible to justify the suspension of the negotiations at the present time if such a state of war existed in ‘ : '' 1 ' the Yemen as would render the visit of the Resident inconvenient or dangerous. There is no indication that such a condition exists, or is immediately probable, and the Resident would have ample time to postpone or curtail his visit if such a situation were to arise. 11. Moreover, it will he recollected that at the same time as the Cabinet authorised the continuance of negotiations with the Imam, they approved the despatch of an ultimatum to the Imam in connection with certain incursions by his forces into the Suheihi country. This ultimatum was duly delivered. The Imam complied with all the demands of His Majesty’s Government and itwas not necessary to resort to hostile measures. The present is a particularly favourable moment, therefore, for the Resident to continue negotiations with the Imam on the basis approved by the Cabinet. ±he Imam will, at the moment, have formed the opinion that His Majesty’s to tolerate the pro in the Protectorate to refuse his signa Government are no longer prepared sence and activities of Zeidi forces , and he will, therefore, be unlikely tune to a treaty, knowing that the result 01 such action will be the despatch of a further ultimatum in connection with his occupation of the Audhali country. 12. linally, the Resident himself has represented the undesirability of postponement. On the 27th October he telegraphed stating that he hoped that the delay would be short as a reply to the Imam is over due and the local situation is now favourable for the resumption of negotiations, which the Imam is expecting on the Resident’s return from leave. The Resident thinks that undesirable re-actions may be produced by continued silence on our part. The Resident has great knowledge of our past relations with the Imam and long experience in the Aden Protectorate. The Colonial Office view is that the greatest weight should be attached to his considered advice. 13. In these circumstances, the Colonial Office ask that the Cabinet decision should be maintained.

Downing Street, 2 ^^ October,1933* o Hes, TO. l&amp; UNDi^R Sir, I am directed bj? Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the letter from this Department of the 25th October enclosing a copy of a telegram from the Resident at Aden reporting that he is now proposing to address a letter to the Imam of the Yemen regarding his visit to Sanaa. 2. On the evening of the 25th October semi-official discussions took place between representatives of this Department and the Foreign Office regarding the Resident’s proposal, and it was pointed out by your Department that it might be desirable to postpone for a short time the Resident’s visit to Sanaa, in view of the strained relations at present existing between King Ibn Saud ana the Imam and the risk of the outbreak of early hostilities between the two Rulers. In order to give time for further consideration of this aspect of the matter, it was decided to address a telegram to the Resident at Aden asking him to defer the despatch of the letter to the Imam pending the receipt of further instructions. In order to ascertain definitely whether the letter hid been stopped ana to explain shortly to the Resident the reason why the first telegram was sent, a second telegram was addressed to him on the 26th October. Copies of these two telegrams are enclosed. 3. A reply bus now been received from the Resident to these two telegrams in which he expresses the hope that the delay will be short, as a reply to the Imam is overdue and the ^ SICRiSTARY OF STATE, FJRailGN Oft’ICS. \ Y Athe local situation is nif favourable for the resumption of negotiations. He states also that undesirable re-actions may be produced if there is further delay in sending a reply to the Imam's letter. A copy of this telegram is also enclosed. 4. Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister is in agreement with the views expressed in the Residents telegram of the 27th Uotober, and, unless there have been further developments in the situation since the semi-official representations were maue on the 25th uctober he would propose, subject to Seorefer Sir John Simon's concurrence,to inform the Resident thtt His Majesty's Government have now given further consideration to the matter, and that he is now authorised to despatch the letter to the Imam as proposed in his telegram No.62 of the 25th of October and proceed with arrangements for his visit to Sanaa. The Secretary of State would propose to add however,that, as the Resident is aware, the situation between the Imam and Ibn faud is at present critical, with a risk of the outbreak of hostilities in the near future, and T that he leaves it to the Resident's discretion to judge in the light of the development of events in the next few weeks whether he should actually proceed to Sanaa, or whether he should suggest to the Imam a postponement of his departure. 5. I am to point out that any prolonged postponement of the further negotiations with the Imam will be likely to have embarrasing results in the Aden Protectorate, /s Sir John Simon is awane, it is hoped as the result of the proposed Ifeegotiations to secure the evacuation by the Imam of certain districts in the Aden Protectorate which are now in his occupationoccupation, and in particular of the Audhali district. It may be expected that if there is any prolonged suspension of negotiations the Resident will be faced with strong pressure from the Audhali tribesmen in support of hostile action against the Imam to secure the evacuation of these areas. Sir Philip 0uniiffe-Lister therefore hopes that Sir John Simon will feel able to give his early concurrence in the proposal in the preceding paragraphs of this letter. 6 .

Signor Guarnaschelli, who was already acquainted with the tenour of your remarks to Signor matti on September 14th, said that the question of a further written communication to His Majesty's Embassy, supplementary' to that enclosed in my despatch Ho. 69S of the 14th instant, was under consideration, though it was not yet certain whether it would be made. In view of this uncertainty I have thought it well to acquaint you with the following observations of Signor viiarnasohe 11 i, who too* the occasion to express himself, in an entirely friendly manner but with considerable frankness, on the general situation in this part of the Arabian peninsula. Signor Guarnasehelli said that the Italian Governments information went to show that the incident in question had, to all intents and purposes, been liquidated, fwo points only remained outstanding. One was that (as was stated in the Acting Resident’s telegram Ho.48, enclosed in your despatch Ho.771 of September l*th) the son of the SheiAh of Amnabia was still retained as a hostage, and the second was that payment was being demanded by the Yemenites for some of the /loot f ^ Honourable Slr Jotl “ Pinion, G.C.S.I..K.0.7.0., etc., etc., etcloot, which was obviously inequitable. i’h© other hostages had all been released. Signor Ciuarnasehelli affirmed that the incident, which had arisen between the local frontier tribes, had not been brought to the knowledge of the ton at all. 3. Signor Guarnaachelli went on to urge that it was not in the interest of His Majesty's Government to proceed to extreme measures. The moment was 'a very difficult one' in tne whole of the Arab peninsula, and any forcible action might produce incalculable and unfortunate results, m particular, he hinted that it might have a most unfavourable affect upon the policy of ibn Sand, regarding whose warlike intentions the Italian Government had recently received dis turbing reports, m reply to this it was suggested to signor iuarnaschelli that the fear of possible reactions in other jarts of the Arabian peninsula seemed to provide an additional reason for the torn to pursue a moderate policy. Signor taarnasohelli did not deny this, and repeated that the Italian tovernaent had, in the past, constantly exercised a moderating influence on the Iia&amp;m. 4 * There was, however. Signor Guarnascheili. said, a forther factor which His Majesty*8 Government should take into account, and that was the ever-increasing activity of the mssians in the /amen• There was a Soviet commercial mission there, Soviet money was being liberally spent and Soviet presents freely distributed, and the whole Soviet 'apparatus’* wis considerably greater than the Italian one. Was it to the ai vantage of His Majesty’s Government to create a situation in wiioh it would be impossible for the Italian Government to Preserve their influence in the Yemen and to prevent it from /fallingfalling under Hassian asoendaney? was it not rather in the interest of His .i'a.iesty's Government that the Italian Government should continue to serve as a moderating intermediary between them and the imam?

Ha basee this assertion on alleged admission of Sheikh Amnabia who had been sent to him under escort from Mocha who he says has returned home. 1 strongly suspect any such admission must have been made by Sheikh under impulse of fear for himself and his hostage son because my Agent who returned from disturbed area by air on September 20th six d»ys after Taiz-'a letter has confirmed previous evidence regarding looting and reported that on September iota nothing further had been restored nor Sheikh and ue son returned but that demand had been received from Mocha ■‘U September 15th »y chief of Birsukaia for payment by his people of 2 years tithes * He also corroborated report received by me on Bepteuibei' ibtn ihac five days previously Yemeni authorities mle a fresh tax raid in Subeihi Salient between frontier and Jebel-Al-Kos whence hostages were taken and five local chiefs mrQ by soldiers to recover tithes from inhabitants, Ariotier raid 1 b expected there next January for collection of ^ on property and Zeidi military posts remain in area* The letter from Tais was brought by private messenger '*a conveyed personal message from Officer Commanding to the affect• ■&lt; * mc i Uiat raidS been fa y of imam with Bhom wa ahould therefore correspond and that.

On the assumption that the negotiations with the Imam were to be broken off, Mr.Champion had submitted a despatch dealing with the frontier in the 'Subeihi f/ area, where the boundary has never been defined and wher it is very desirable that some modus vivendi should be Mr.Champion suggested that he should approach tljie Imam after his proposed Akldhali operations with a view to getting him to agree to the Anglo-Turkish boundary as a temporary de facto administrative line, without prejudice to a permanent readjustment, t which he thought that certain concessions might be made in this area by way of compromise if other more important parts of the frontier were satisfactorily settled. 4-. in the present circumstances however no to the despatch is required and the Colonial Office reply propose merely to tell Mr.Champion that Colonel Reilly will take the matter up if and when he considers it opportune. * e may safely he guided by the Colonial Office/Minute Paper.

' • Zhe proposed bombing operations in the Subeihi Country- In this connexion please see the minute on P.Z.5641. Before the draft there authorized could issue, a meeting of the C.I.D,Sub-Committee (of which the minutes will be found at P.Z.5967) was called owing to the Air Ministry’s desire that the Acting Resident should be authorized to bomb without further delay or reference home, so soon as he thought it necessary, and^their view of the inadequacy of the restitution hitherto made. The Foreigi Office arri Colonial Office held that if the signs of clearing up continued (a further telegram from Aden - P.Z.5739- had by then been received), a new situation had been ^ •&gt; d' fur**. created in which fresh Ministerialpputhority was required .which could in any case be forthcoming with only a very short delay. Moreover the Italians had manifested some concern at our proposals and had promised to use their influence with the Imam to return the loot and hostages (Rome telegram at P.Z.5754; cf P.Z.5802 and 5973 since received). In the end it was decided to add to the original draft telegram to Aden, which issued on Septenter 16th, the words 'if your report indicates that complete restitution is/ 1 HiJ0S1 is being avoidably delayed I anticipate that it will be possible to give without delay the authority which you seek'. The Acting Resident was also informed of our conversations with the Italians in Rome and here.(P.Z.5912). The Air Ministry have placed on record their protest on the inability of the other departments to agree with them and have threatened to take the matter up through their Secretary of State. 11^ S-Corr-A -Arvt . / —^ ^ 6 -f.

The area over which British protection was of Arabia 1S and shuaferTh t eSe tW ° tr f aties as the Barhimi territory on the south coast of Arabia, and situated between the territories of the ’Aqrabi and ’Atifi tribes which territory is under he.r (the Barhimi Shaikhs^ authority and jurisdiction and the ,; 1 | da '' lt ? ry 011 , the south coast of Arabia and situated between the territory of the Barhimi tribe, and that under the authority of the Turkish Government at Shaikh The d SwE WhlC n mt0r J f' nder their ( the ’ Atifi Shaikhs'') authority and jurisdiction and Barhimi trihalT 116 ! theS6 ‘Y were exclusively the heads of the ’Atifi a d Barhimi tribal families respectively, and their near relations; and no representa- ives o any other dependent or allied sections were associated with them therein 4. these treaties were made fifteen years before the Anglo-Turkish boundary vas fixed, and it is clear that their intention was to ensure the inviolability of the coast Ime from Perim to the ’Aqrabi limits (which had been similarly secured by Aden “ 1888 ^ Altches0n s Trea ‘&gt;«b” Volume XIII, page 122), and thence to m 5' ®y th , e fcrins of the “ Subeihi engagement ” of 1881 (vide “ Aitcheson’s , a i./i i 0 unie XIII, page 91), His Majesty’s Government acknowledged the Abclali oultans as exercising sovereign authority over the territory occupied by all e tribes of the Subeihi, except such as then acknowledged Turkish supremacy; and by an Agreement of 1882 (vide “ Aitcheson’s Treaties,” Volume XIII, page 93), British protection was confirmed over the territories of the ’Abdali Sultans. It may therefore be held that the “ territory occupied by all the tribes of the Subeihi ” (within the Anglo-Turkish boundary) is still under His Majesty’s Government’s pro- tection by virtue of the inter-relation of these two instruments. 6. It may be assumed that, separate Treaties having been made with the ’Atifi and Barhimi eight years after the Subeihi engagement, these two tribes were not at that time considered to be c ‘ Subeihis ’ ’; but that term has for many years been loosely used to include all the tribes west of Haushabi, ’Abdali, and ’Aqrabi limits, and within the Anglo-Turkish boundary. 7. I make this somewhat lengthy statement in order to clear up any possibility of uncertainty m regard to our de jure protective commitments m the area in question. 8. The tribes and sections concerned in the particular issue which I desire to describe are as follows :— 7 Buseili Ka’luli (part of) j Hureibi Bureihani Shumaya \ Mahwali. ’Atifi Barhimi. Juleidi ... Bureimi i Mudariba { Aghbari. Bushbushi Ka’luli (part of) Shubeiqi. * Not reproduced. Aden.—Gp. 6. 131/2963. 24. 9/33. (16671) M. &amp; S.9. It would appear from a study of the reports of the British Commissioner on the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission (a copy of one of, which I enclose herewith) that after lengthy discussions, a compromise was reached and the boundary was finally demarcated with consideration to its geographical position and to its ease of' identification. But the fact, stated by the British Commissioner, that it was the recognized border between the tribal sub-sections involved, has not prevented sub sequent confusion in regard to the primary tribal divisions. In this sense the boun dary had the effect of splitting Juleidi, Bureimi, and ’Atifi territories, part of vhich thereby fell under Turkish control and part under British protection—notwithstanding that it may accurately have divided the sub-sections of these tribes one, from another. 10. As you are aware, the Imam has consistently refused to recognize the Anglo- Turkish boundary as the de jure frontier between the Protectorate and the Yemen, and has not yet specifically admitted the existence of a de facto frontier by the signa ture of a treaty with His Majesty’s Government. In the absence of an agreed definition of even a de facto frontier in the “ Subeihi ” area in question between Husn Murad and Wadi ’Ubil, and by reason of the Imam’s valid claim to sovereignty in those parts of the territories of the Juleidi, Bureimi, and ’Atifi tribes which lie in the Yemen, Zeidi officials, assisted by troops' have frequently crossed the Anglo-Turkish boundary, and have collected taxes and otherwise executed administrative control in those parts of the said territories which lie in the Protectorate. A summary of these incidents is enclosed herewith. 11. The matter has been complicated by the peculiar ignorance of the various Chiefs of these primitive tribes as to the status of those of their sub-sections that were divided by the Anglo-Turkish boundary, and by their acquiescence in Zeidi penetration before 1927. Moreover these Chiefs have never been in close touch with the Residency, and the information that has hitherto been obtained from them in legald to their complicated tribal organization and divisions is incomplete and often contradictory; nor have political conditions in their territories yet allowed of the visit of a Political Officer for the purpose of a detailed inquiry. 12. No organized Zeidi military penetration into the area having been attempted since the incidents of 1927, all complaints by the Chiefs of minor Zeidi interference with their tribesmen (in the Protectorate) have been investigated, and when ever confirmed have been deferred to the Imam’s Officer Commanding at Ta’iz by way of formal protest. The adoption of this procedure, which has been necessitated by requirements of caution in so uncertain a situation, has had the effect of checking but not of preventing Zeidi activities within the Protectorate in the area concerned •’ a an it has been anticipated that the whole question would be dealt with by direct &gt; discussion at Sana a, either during the negotiations for the treaty with the Imam or ? as soon as conveniently possible after their successful conclusion attend w’lfi ^ desirable that a soluti °n of the matter should be attempted without further^dblay; but it now seems unlikelv that it can be found in the manner suggested m the preceding paragraph, owing to the probable imminent suspension of the treaty negotiations with the Imam. It would, moreover be inexpedient to attempt to compel the Imam’s acceptance of the Anglo-Turkish recoil m wu 0Cahty ’ 7 hl l ch 1 he has hith erto, and with some justice, refused to ecogmze, and the siting of which is admittedly open to objection. adrmfi n r fTT 1 ? b6 leSS ob i ectionable t0 invi te the Imam to agree to the provisional 7 t mt me ’ aS a tem P° rar y administrative boundary, pending and without 0 -fn n; l- Perm T nent read 3 ustm ent of it that may subsequently be made by STb Wltb W J n recommending this course for your consideration I have in of tt h J X T Pe ^ e - y of T re £ er J m g th ? a ^ a included approximately in the salient north north tn V abawa Hamaliya J.

It ma y remarked that the Boundary Commission, on entering Subeihi country, was given to understand that the western Subeihi frontier passed by &lt;7. Am Missas and thence skirted the southern slopes of the hills, reaching the sea in the vicinity of Turba, while it was found that the Turks locally laid claim to all the territory east of Shaikh Sa id up to the line of J. Am Missas. J. Kharaz, and Ras Arah. Subsequently, investigations showed that the western borders of the Juleidi, Bureimi, and Atifi sections of the Subeihi extended respectively to the points ’Akama, Akkar, and Kudam, and although these extreme limits have not been insisted on, the boundaiy actually delimited from J. Numan to Husn Murad still vindicates the Subeihi claims as against Turkish pretensions to the extent of some hundreds of square miles. The Turks had, in the past, unobtrusively exercised jurisdiction up to the line of J. A. Missas and J. Kharras, the Subeihi tribal sub-sections of Mudariba, Aghbari, Ka’luh, Mahwah, and Jarthati having actually paid taxes to the Ottoman officials at Mocha. The Turkish Commissioners at first insisted strongly on their claim to the Aghbari, mainly on account of the religious importance attached by their authorities to the well- known shrine of Turba, situated within Aghbari limits, and it was only in the course of the Ottoman Commissioner s recent prolonged stay at Shaikh Sa’id that the claim was relinquished. The result was to yield a natural boundary which from J. Numan almost entirely follows the watershed between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is easily distinguishable and has the further merit of being the recognized border between the tribal sub-sections inhabiting the country through which it passes. ********** Enclosure 2 in No. Summary of events demonstrating Imamic interference in south-western Subeiht Territory. September, 1927. Three parties of Zeidi soldiers entered the Protectorate border, a total of about 900 strong. First party proceeded against the Bushbushi sub-section at Wadi ’Adim. Second party against some Bureimi sub-sections at Wadi TJbil. Third party against the Ahl Buseili and ’Atifis at Mudariba, Am Shat, and Dar Rahban. They were reported to be advancing south towards Turan and Haweirib. They burnt houses and looted livestock and demanded submission, Jithes, and hostages from the people, and posted a garrison at Am Mijza’, 'belong to the Ahl Shumaya. October, 1927. Warnings were dropped on Am Mijza’ giving the Imamic troops 48 hours in which to evacuate the Protectorate in the Mijza and Turan areas, failing which they would be bombed. The Imam’s troops withdrew at once. Letters were dropped on Ta’iz, Qa taba, and Ibb notifying the recent action taken in the Subeihi country and warning the Officers Commanding at these places thaT should any further raids into the Protectorate take place, the towns^of Ta’iz, Qa’taba, Ibb, and anv other places m the Imam s territory which it would be deemed suitable to attack, would be bombed. A copy of the warning was sent to the Imam. April p 1929. The ’Amil of Al Waza’iya (the Yemen) wrote to the Buseilis telling them to pay tithes, or they would be punished. His Highness the Sultan of Lahej was requested to write privately to the Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, about the incident. (16671)June, 1929. The ’Amil of A1 Waza’iya sent a party of Imamie soldiers to Turan to recover taxes. The Buseilis refused compliance and fired on them. The same night the soldiers raided Turan and carried off two bullocks and a camel, and the 'Amil threatened to send a force to punish the Buseilis. A reply, dated 11th June, 1929. was received from the Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, that he had warned the ’Aqils of A1 Waza’iya against making any trouble on the border June, 1929. A report was received from the Bushbushi Shaikh at Khabana that on 21st June about 100 Imamic soldiers had come and damaged crops and palm trees and occupied the fort at Khabana, and had left a garrison there. They had given out that the raid was a punishment for not paying taxes. A report was received from one of the Bureimi Shaikhs at Majba that in the middle of May a party of Imamic soldiers had raided Am Mizza and carried away 300 sheep and goats. August, 1929. The Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, himself sent a Circular letter to the Buseilis telling them to pay taxes. His Highness the Sultan of Lahej 'was asked to write privately to th,e Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, pointing out the consequences that would follow any attack on or attempt at coercion of the Buseilis who were under the protection of His Majesty’s Government and to request him, in the interests of peace, to refrain from such action. The Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, replied that he was unaware that the Buseilis inhabited Protectorate limits, and that he had now issued orders for the suspension of all negotiations with them. July, 1932. The ’Atifi Shaikh complained of past Zeidi aggression against the borders of his Ka luli, Hureibi, and against the Shubeiqi sub-section (Bureimi) over which he has a certain control. He stated that they had been paying taxes forcibly to the Imam for the last 8 or 9 years, althqugh they were under British protection, and that they were now being threatened with attack. He also complained that the Imam had held a hostage from the KaTulis since 1927. A party of Imamic soldiers also encroached against Am Shat am Tawil in Buseili territorv August, 1932. t Zeidis from Mocha and Shuqeira entered ’Atifi and Bureimi territory at uiba, ludariba, Farrukhiya, and Am Shat to enforce payment of taxes, and were reported to be threatening Wadi Timnan. The treaty negotiations with the Imam having at that time reached an advanced stage, conciliatory, rather than forcible action was taken by the Residency, and His ig mess the Sultan of Lahej was requested again to write to the Officer Commanding, a iz, ringing to his notice the complaint of the ’Atifi Shaikh and the recent encroach ment by imamic troops into ’Atifi and Bureimi territory, explaining to him that the su i sections concerned were under the protection of His Majesty’s Government and warning him m a friendly way, as was done in August, 1929. The Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, replied to the effect that the Ka’lulis and Shubeiqis e onged to the Waza iya area of the Mocha district and had never been part of the U 3ei n country, and that the KaTulis had in the past tendered submission to the Imam ot their own free will. uecemoer, lyoz. i • ^he Residency Office addressed the Officer Commanding, Ta’iz, pointing out tha his assertion that the KaTuli sub-section had submitted willingly to the Imam wa inaccurate and that neither%y nor the other sub-sections concerned had voluntaril ccep e mamic control, and- had paid taxes to the Imam unwillingly and by illega compulsion It was also pointed out that &lt;?t the time of the Turkish occupation 'o the Bureimi SlriiH 111 su b-sections had never ceased paying revenue t&lt; The Officer Commanding, Ta iz, replied in the same strain as before.April, 1933. Complaints were received from the ’Atifi and Barhimi Shaiklis of further Zeidi encroachments in January, 1933, against the Shubeiqi and Bureihani territories at 1 Farukhiya, Bitau Am Lasbah, and Gheil Barbar, the levying of taxes and the taking of two more hostages. They stated that the Ka’luli Shaikh Ind his three sons werf detained at Shuqeira, whi e his fourth son, taken hostage in 1927, was still in Yarim.

I am, ; Sir, our most obedient servant,Downing Street, September, 1933. » w- w ■-.j j ■ Sir, I have the honour to refer to my secret desoateh of the 11th of September, and to inform you that Hie ajesty's Government have now considered the various modifications and amendrents which the Imam has proposed in the draft treaty. You commented upon these in your secret despatch No.162 of the 12th of July. 2. I now enclose a memorandum embodying the conclusions of His Majesty's Cover iment upon these various modifications and amendments. The Resident should be guided by the comments made in this memorandum during the forthcoming negotia tions. It will be observed that la a number of Instances His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the Imam'sImam's amendments, and that in others, thoi^gh^His Majesty's Government would preier their own wording, the Resident is given discretion to accept the Imam's amendments, if necessary. in certain instances, however, His Majesty's Government must insist upon the adoption of their own wording: thememorandum makes clear those instances in which this course must he followed. o. Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly anticipates that if he succeeds in concluding a treaty with the Imam, the latter is very likely to enquire what facilities His ajesty's Government pr@pa.r8d t»o grant to him for the purchase of arms from British sources, and the Resident has as.ced that he should receive instructions on this point. 4. it is true that in the earlier negotiations with the Imam reference has been made to the possibility that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to supply arms to the imam if a treaty was concluded. The positionposition has, however, changed considerably in recent years, and His Majesty's Government cannot now agree that any undertaking of this kind should be given to the Imam. They have just refused a request of a similar nature from King ibn Saud, and in these circumstances they could not very well accede to a similar request from the Imam. While, therefore, if the Imam raises the matter, Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly is at liberty to say that he will report to His Majesty's Government any request of this kind, he should decline to entertain any proposals for the supply of arms, or for financial assistance for the purchase of arms, and he should refuse to commit His Majesty's - Government in any way in regard to the purchase of arms from private sources. 5. Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly has asked for guidance as to the attitude whichwhich he should adopt If the Imam raises tae question of the Red Sea Islands. The P sition in regard to these islands is as stated in paragraph 6 of the Resident's letter to the Imam of the nth April, 1933 . Lieutenant- colonel Reilly would not propose, of course, to raise the matter with the Imto, out if the Imam himself refers to this question, the Resident, while refusing to discuss the merits of the case, may say that he will renort to His Majesty's Government any observations Which the Iras® may raake. As India is also to be a. party to the treaty, two full powers from His Majesty the King will he required, one to enable the Resident to sign for the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the other to enableMs Majesty’s Government have oonsiaered the amendments of the draft treaty proposed by the Imam of the x0men ln hls 1@tter t0 the Resident of the 20th June, 1955 and have reached the following conclusions. These conclusions are set out in the accompanying note and the Resident at Aden should be guided by them in his forthcoming negotiations with the Imam. t has been decided that the Government of India shall be a party to the Treaty and it will therefore be necessary to amend the preamble as follows:- Have resolved to conclude this Treaty and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland snd the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Dmperor of India: For Great Britain and northern Ireland: For India:His Hajasty the Iliag of the Taman, the Imam* Article I ^Dhe Imam wishes to insert the words 'and his Government” in this Article after both ”His Majesty the ICing of Great Britain ' etc* and : 'Hie Majesty the icing of the Yemen* ‘ fh® phrase ’’and his Government” in relation to ”His Majesty the King of Great Britain, ©to.,' is objectionable both on formalistic grounds and also because it might be applicable to His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions, who are not parties to the treaty, and it is therefore essential that the phrase 'and his Government” should be omitted, in respect of His Majesty the King of Great Britain. If, however, the Imam wishes it retained in respect of himself, the Resident may if necessary agree, but he should suggest to the Imam as a more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter that notes should be exchanged stating that the -Treaty ie binding upon His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India on the one hand and uponupon the government of the Yemen on the other hand* A draft of such a note from the Resident to the Imam is attached. A note on similar lines mutatis mutandis would be sent by the Imam to the Resident. Article III. xo.e Imam wishes to omit the words n of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen”. i? 1 or reasons which have been fully explained in previous correspondence it is essential that these words should be reinserted and the Resident should insist on this. The Imam.. :hmr '* under their protection”. The Imam l s omission may be A-' .v/A A- accepted or alternatively the words 'by his subjects or' may also be omitted if the Imam so desires. Article IV. The Imam wishes to substitute the phrase 'general international principles' for the phrase 'the principles of general international practice'. This amendment may be accepted. Article V.Article V. The Imam has omitted from paragraph 1 the words from the date of the coming into force of the present Treaty 5 . It is considered desirable that these words should he reinserted in order that it may be quite olear that the provisions of this Article commence to operate as from the date on which the Treaty comes into force* It is true that Article YU of the draft treaty states that the treaty shall come into force on the date of the exchange of ratifications, but even so it is considered desirable that the words in question should be included in paragraph (1) of Article Y in order that there may be no doubt that this particular Article is operative as from the date of the ratification of the treaty. It could be explained to the Imam that this is the only reason for the inclusion of these words* If however the Imam insists that these words should b© omitted, and the Resident is satisfied that the Imam’s reasons for their omission do not prejudice the position, he may in the last resort agree. Inparagraph 1 and 2 the Imam has substituted the phrase 'each of the high oontraoting parties' for the phrase ,r one high oontraoting party'. This amendment In paragraph 1 the Imam has inserted the words 'and judgments' after the words 'local laws'. The Resident should ask the Imam to explain why he made this insertion and if the Resident is satisfied that the reasons are innoouous, he may accept the amendment. It would. however, be preferable, if the Imam will agree, that the word ” courts' should be substituted for the word 'judgments She imam has omitted the whole of paragraph 5 . fhis paragraph is necessary to ensure, inter alia, that while the privileges granted in paragraphs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in respect of British subjects vessels etc. are applicable to the whole of ..the British eoamoxnrealth of nations the /V' privileges granted to Yemeni subjects Teasels etc. are not granted in reapeat of the Dominions.

His Majesty 1 © Government must insist, therefore, that this paragraph should be reinserted. In paragraph 2 the Imam has substituted the words n in the ports of the other' for the words ”in the ports of the territories of the other'. fhis amendment must be read in conjunction with the proposed omission of paragraph 3 .

His Majesty’s Government do not attaoh great importance to the retention of these words and if the Imam is very desirous of their omission the Resident Article Til. may agree. t t His Majesty's Government's draft proposes that the English and Arabic texts shall have equal foroe whereas the Imam wishes the Arabic text to prevail in oase of douot. in dealing with this amendment the Resident should be guided by the instructions contained in S Paragraph 12 of the Secretary of State's Secret despatch ^ Jl' of the 14th April I 932 . r '4 £$ L- Secret Thxs is wholly unacceptable and must he omitted.With reference to previous correspondence regarding the negotiation of a treaty with the Imam of the Yemen, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- lister to transmit to you, to be laid before the Board of Trade, copies of despatches from the Resident and the Acting -tesident at Aden dated the ISth April and the 12th July, 1933. 2. It has been decided that a further attempt should be made to conclude a treaty with the Imam; and it is proposed that on the return of the Resident to aden next month he should proceed to Sanaa for this purpose. 3. In the meantime, consideration has been given to the various amendments proposed by the Imam in his letter of the 20th June, 1933, which is enclosed in Mr. Champion 1 s despatch of the 12th July, 1933, and the necessary instructions as to the attitude which the Resident should adopt in regard to the various amendments are in course of preparation. 4. Article Y (2) of the draft treaty submitted by His Majesty's Government to the Imam ( see enclosure to the Resident's despatch of the 12th April, 1933) reads as follows:- 'Similarly the vessels of one High Contracting Party, their cargoes and their passengers shall in the ports of the territories of the other receive treatment SHE SECRETARY, BOARD OP TRaDE.(sk i f-hrt. treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the vessels, their cargoes and their passengers of any other foreign country”. The lixiac has submitted certain amendments to this para graph 8T}.ong which is the omission of the words TT and their passengers”. 5. The intention ox these words is presumably to make it clear that in the case of a vessel of one High Contracting Party calling at a port of the other High Contracting Party with passengers of a foreign State on board, the passengers of the foreign State would not receive less favourable treatment in the port than if they were travelling on a vessel of their own nationality. While Sir Philip Cunliffe-Iister would prefer th words should be re-inserted, he is not disposed great importance to their retention, and he would propose to leave it to the Residents discretion to decide after discussion with the Imam whether these words should be retained or not. I am to enquire whether the Board of Trade concur in the Resident being instructed accordingly. 6. As it will be necessary for the proposed instructions to be issued shortly, I am to request the favour of a very early reply to this letter. I am.

Counsellor of Italian Embassy on 14th September spoke here on instructions in general sense of your telegram*, He was informed that local negotiations were still proceeding and that no ultimatum had yet been issued*, (For your own information authorization to issue it is not being given to Acting Resident pending further report), • It was explained, to him that incursion into this extreme south-west corner of Aden Protectorate was new development of YemrrL activities and had created serious impression on local tribes, whom we were under treaty obligation to protect* Speedy and complete restoration of position was therefore essential. It was hoped that early success of local negotiations would make forcible action unnecessary and His majesty 1 s Government were grateful to Italian Government for undertaking to urge moderation on Imam. Italian Government as Colonial Power would no doubt appreciate, however, that if Yemeni authori ties, as seemed possible y were adopting evasive and pro crastinatory attitude, it would be necessary by issue of ultimatum to indicate that His Majesty’s Government must insist on complete restitution, cince incursion occurred in June, no undertaking could be given that immediate issue of ultima-turn would not shortly be necessary.2 I ,n ior Vitetti ©.uQuirso. wliS’thQr ‘tliors Weis aiiy connexion between this incident and dispute between imam and Ibn Baud.

GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS stated that aggressive action had heen taken by the Zeidis within the protectorate territory 0 The full implications of this action had 'been studied by this Committee and their considered recommendations submitted to the Cabinet. The Cabinet had sanctioned retaliatory ac uj-on. Subsequent to that sanction a very normal situation report had been received from the Acting Resident in his telegram No. 37. In his view this telegram revealed no fundamental changes in the situation. The daily situation was bound to be ever changing and only those on the spot could judge its implications. The offences for which action was authorised had been committed and no punishment had been administered. The Acting Resident 1 s telegram merely disclosed in his opinion, and he had a feeling that the Resident would, agree, what was a very typical manifestation of Arab diplomacy. The Commander of Taiz expressed complete ignorance of the incidents and a determination to make complete restitution,, A further letter received from him later again repeated his pacific intentions and gave a and stock had been restored m assurance that all captives When we came to consider the actual situation as dis closed by our reconnaissance party we foun&amp;p firstly, that the Zeidis had indeed withdrawn. This meant literally nothing. They were only a raiding party and there was not tu..e least doubt that they had not the smallest intention o.l suaying. The kidnapped tribesmen referred to as released were obviously the ordinary incidental prisoners of the raid who would have been released or killed anyhow. On the other hand the Sheik s - 2 -1 I / &lt; * -3- son had Deen petal npd nr'rn^ ^-p 4 u^ -1 x lnLa » none uJ: the looted property had been re turned, and a motor track was being prepared 30 miles msiae the protectorate boundary by orders of the Go/ernor Of Mocha. Additional offences had also been committed. Tne headmen of two villages had been summoned (on the 31st August) to proceed and report to the representative of the luidiii a o Mocna and neither hostages nor booty had been re leased from there. Those were the facts as detailed in the Acting Resident’s telegram No. 43. 'He went on to empress his intention of confirming that these facts were correct and if they were j of addressing the Commander of Taiz again and insisting on fuH.restitution. He concluded by asking urgently for permission to take air action in the case of further delays or refusals to comp 1 v. It seemed to him that no one could pretend that any serious alteration for the better had occurred in the situa tion as revealed in that telegram. He insisted that all that was happening was absolutely typical of evasive Arab diplomacy designed merely to cause delay. On the one hand the Commander at Taiz was making protestations wnich are not being home out by action, on the other a very partial restitution of the unwanted and the less desirable captures were being made whilst the most useful were being retained and at the same time further offences were being committed. This was so typical of Arab behaviour that in his view it would be fatal to stay our hand beyond the point en visaged in the last sentence of the Acting Resident’s telegram, but it was on these facts that the draft telegram from the Colonial Office to Acting Kesiuent was baoed. If that telegram had concluded with the words -if these fail you may take action as above” it would have been in every way-4- acceptable, because it would, nave allowed trie Acting Resident and his adviser the Officer Oonmianding the Forces in Aden to seize the psychological moment when it became obvious that the friendly protestations of the Commander of Taiz were not in fact genuine ? to take the action already considered necessary and sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government. As the telegram stood ? however, it meant that no matter what occurred in the interim the Acting Resident must again refer back for a decision as to whether action was to be taken. The final telegram received from the Acting Resident (No. 45) disclosed a still more unsatisfactory state of affairs a very partial restitution had been made but only in exchange for cash payments. He did not see how we could possibly accept restitution of this nature. If we aid so we were admitting the principle tnat the Zeidis could force our unfortunate protegees to redeem for cash their own goods which the Zeidis had stolen* and he thought it would be agreed that that really amounted to admitting that had the Zeidis stolen cash instead of kind we would have been prepared to do nothing. about it. If that was indeed our policy then b.e had nothing further to add. In holding our hand* if we proposed to hold it in the light of the present situation* we were flouting one of the first and fundamental principles of air control* we were accepting evasive rep .lies and promises which were not genuine in lieu of taking action* and this could not but have the inevitable and normal repercussions on the oriental men tality on both sides of the frontier. In his view the Cabinet’s decision to take action was being withheld from the Acting Resident and Commander-in-Chief on the spot* who alone was fitted to judge the day uo daptactical alterations in the situation* on totally in adequate groundSo The typically Arab diplomacy displayed ty the Commander a? Taiz was having all the effect that he intended and .e were still no nearer meting out the impera tively necessary punishment to the Zeidis fcr their unjusti- libG anaaggressive action than we were before the matter was originally re±erred for a Cabinet decision He considered this incident 5 and the way it was being dealt with 9 would Soi ll ruptner encourage the already existing belief amongst our own tribes in the Protectorate that we had neither the intention nor the ability to protect them 0 The growth of such a belief s and it was undoubtedly growing 9 was a most dangerous matter 0 should be satisfied with nothing less than complete and immediate restitution of all hostages and loot, and he con sidered it imperative that the Acting Resident should be em powered forthwitn to despatch an ultimatum to that effect as soon as he considered the psychological moment had arrived, xua coula not despatch an ultimatum unless you were prepared to implement it and for that reason he should also be em powered to urdice what action he considered necessary within the terms of the Cabinet decision. MHtf C0¥ELL Ported out that the Cabinet authority covered ° niy 3 aemand for withdrawal of the Zeidis and the restoration postages and loot, ana did not cover retaliatory or punitive act ion. y hu-c, PARKINSON said that, in his view, the Acting Resident’s telegrams Nos. 43 and 45 indicated that a considerable proportion ' ° f the l00ted Property had been returned. Should the proposed ultimatum to the Governor of Taiz fail to produce complete restitution, the Secretary cf State for the Colonies could, he ' thought, m view cf the recent decision of the Cabinet, give immediate sanction, and there would be no appreciable delay in | authorizing any necessary action, j ”5 -m - ^HN3R agreed with the Colonial Office view that the situation had improvedj evacuation had been secured 9 though full retribution had not been made. The degree ol uigency was 9 in his opinion^ now less acute. The Foreign Office had instructed His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Rome to explain the situation to the Italian Government * Having regard to the Italian Government’s views as given in telegram No. 290 from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires (Appendix A) it was the more necessary to ensure that the issue of an ultimatum was fully justified The Foreign Office therefore preferred the Colonial Office proposal to that advanced by the Air Ministry. MR. PARKINSON observed that the Acting Resident had confined his communications to the Governor of Taiz^ and had not referred to the Imam direct. After some discussion it was agreed that as the Governor of Taiz was presumably in communication with the Imam, and had previously shewn himself to be amenable to reasons, the Acting Resident was probably justified in this procedure. GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS said that an extensive raid into British Territory had been committed. In the Air Ministry view swift and immediate retribution was essential, Limited action might * at present 9 suffice. Possibly one despatch of an ultimatum might alone secure the desired result. If this action were deferred 9 and the longer it were deferred* the more extensive and drastic would be the eventual operations entailed.These delays were having a very great moral effect on the local tribes for whose protection we were responsible. We could not, for ever, continue a policy in bne Protectorate which meant losing 'face' with our own tribes as well as with the Zeidis. Neither could we continue 'go flout the essential principles of air conurol without paying dearly for it in the long run. iJt. MORLEY said that the India Office were only remotely concerned and had no strong views either way. Personally he would not have thought that, as the raid was committed last June, the delay of an extra day or so, entailed by a further reference home for instructions, would appreciably decrease the effectiveness of any action eventually taken. T H'! JLj i. • gene ra 11 y COLONEL HENDERSON stated that the War Office agreed with the Colonial Office point of view. CAPTAIN MOORE said the Admiralty were not directly interested, though they sympathised with the Air Ministry in view of the effect delay would have on Arab mentality in general, and on the local tribes in particular. MR. PARK. IN SON said that it had not been possible to get Colonel Reilly to attend this meeting. He suggested that one way out of the present difficulty was that the telegram should go to the Acting Resident as drafted in the Colonial Office but that authority should be given to Colonel Reilly, who was due in Aden on the 22nd October, to take such action as he might consider necessary without further reference*, He also said that in any case, the Colonial Office draft should be expanded so as to let the Acting Resident know that the Italian G-overnment had beena pp ro a che d a nd wha t the i r v i e ws we re • IVIP.o WARNER suggested that the Air Ministry T s wishes might to some extent he met if it was indicated in the draft telegram to the Acting Resident, that there was no reason to suppose that, if there was much further delay in securing adequate measures of restitution from the Yemeni authorities, sanction to issue the ultimatum would not speedily he given. GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS said that this draft telegram did not meet the Air Ministry views. He was prepared to accept it personally, hut only on the principle of half a loaf being better than no bread, and because the despatch of the suggested telegram, if it was the nearest to Air- Ministry views he could persuade them to adopt, would a c least prevent some avoidable delay. He would have to refer the matter back to his Department for them to consider whether they wished him to register complete disagreement or a protest in the nature of a minority report. (Bee note below). TI SUB“COMMITTEI accordingly agreed? that the following telegram should be despatched by the Colonial Office to the Acting Resident at Aden s ,? Subeihi incursion.

Much of the correspondence discusses the progress of treaty negotiations between the British Government and the Imam (a treaty was eventually signed on 11 February 1934). The principal correspondents are the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Philip Cunliffe-Lister), the Political Resident at Aden (Bernard Rawdon Reilly – also referred to as the Chief Commissioner at Aden – and, in Reilly's absence, the Acting Political Resident, Reginald Stuart Champion), the British Ambassador to Italy (Ronald William Graham, succeeded by Sir James Eric Drummond), His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires at Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert), the Imam of Yemen, and various officials of the India Office, the Colonial Office, and the Foreign Office.Matters discussed in the correspondence include:Whether the Government of India should be included as a signatory of the proposed treaty.Reports of Yemeni incursions (referred to as 'tax raids' – armed incursions made with a view to collecting taxes on behalf of the Imam) into the Subeihi district of the Aden Protectorate.An ultimatum, issued by the British Government to the Imam, requesting the withdrawal of forces and the return of hostages, with a threat of aerial bombardment in the event of the Imam's non-compliance.Concerns that any action taken by the British against the Imam might be interpreted both by Italy and by Saudi Arabia as encouraging Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] in his dispute with the Imam.Details of the precise terms of the proposed treaty, and of the Political Resident's mission to San'a for the resumption of treaty negotiations with the Imam.The British precondition that, prior to the treaty being signed, the Imam must remove all restrictions on overland trade between Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, as well as surrender the territories and subjects of those chiefs who are in treaty relations with the British.Arrangements for the ratification of the treaty.An enquiry from the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, regarding whether the proposed treaty will include an article committing the Imam to taking action against slavery.In addition to correspondence, the volume includes the following:Copies of minutes from meetings of the Imperial Defence Committee's Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, which discuss Britain's relations with the Imam.Extracts from the Aden Political Residency's political intelligence summaries.A map of the Aden Protectorate.The French material in this volume consists of one telegram.
