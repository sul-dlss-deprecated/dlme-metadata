The correspondence begins with the reported death of Shaikh Saif bin Hamad ash-Sharqi [Shaikh Saif bin Ḥamad Āl Sharqī], Ruler of Fujairah, on 24 December 1938. The rest of the file concerns the Sultan's claim that the Shaikh of Fujairah is a subject of Muscat.In the file the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat reports that he has received from the Sultan a passport – given by the Muscat Government to Shaikh Saif bin Hamad's brother and successor, Muhammad bin Hamad – so that the Political Agent may grant a visa for Muhammad bin Hamad's passage to Bahrain. The remaining correspondence is concerned with how the Political Agent should respond, since it is suspected that the granting of a visa would amount to the British recognising the Sultan's claim.The principal correspondents are the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.The Arabic language material consists of a letter received by the Political Agent from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (an English translation is included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Fujairah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Fujairah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Visas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00000f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00000f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
