It contains 60 named and unnamed individuals (in Arabic and English) of the Salaymī (Suba‘i) family of ‘Unayzah, some with birth and death dates, as well as brief biographical information.The table was compiled by John Calcott Gaskin in 1905 and revised by Captain Francis Beville Prideaux, Political Agent at Bahrain, and by Captain Stuart George Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait, in 1906. Knox was assisted by ’Abdul ’Azīz-bin-Sulaimān-bin-Muhammad-bin-Salaim [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Sulaymān bin Muḥammad bin Salaym] whose name appears in the table.There is also a 'Chronological list of the Amirs of ’Anaizah belonging to this family' with the periods of their reign, including: Sulaimān-bin-Yahya [Sulaymān bin Yaḥyá], ’Abdullah-bin-Sulaimām [‘Abdullāh bin Sulaymān], Ibrāhīm-bin-Sulaimān [Ibrāhīm bin Sulaymān], ’Abdullah-bin-Yahya [‘Abdullāh bin Yaḥyá], Zāmil-bin-’Abdullah [Zāmil bin ‘Abdullāh], Interregnum, ’Abdullah-bin-Yahya-bin-Sālih [‘Abdullāh bin Yahyá bin Ṣāliḥ], Sālih-al-Amīr [Ṣāliḥ al-Amīr], Hamad-bin-’Abdullah-bin-Yahya [Ḥamad bin ‘Abdullāh bin Yahyá], ’Abdul ’Azīz-bin’Abdullah [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abdullāh]. There is also a note concerning the tribal origins of the Salaymī family.In addition, a section of 'Notes' is included that gives 1907 as the year of compilation (presumably by John Gordon Lorimer), as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: the omission of all females; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of children from the same father according to seniority from left to right; dates of birth, and in some cases death, are approximate only; and when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876399.0x00000b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
