The information given is as of 31st December 1935. There are attached prints of the Company's map of Bahrein Island on which are shown all well locations and the Company's various facilities including pipe lines, pump stations, and camp sites. There are alao shown enough topographical contours to show the position of Jebel Duichan. A few of the buildings in the old camp were abondoned or dismantled and moved to new locations during 1935, but the majority of the buildings in the old camp are being used to house construction men who are in Bahrein to sssist in the building of a refinery. The new camp is not yet complete and construction work is being continued. Production during 1935 exceeded that of any previous year. A number of tankers called and lifted cargoes of crude petroleum f^m the Company's Itra Terminal. Production was regulated to meet the shipments. ring the latter part of the year preliminary work was started for the erection of a refinery in Sections 9D and 15D. Work was also started on enlargement of the Company's oil gathering system, and the drilling program - somewhat accelerated. These activities made it necessary to increase the number of employees. * It Will be noted that this report does not include a complete roster ' the enPl0yee8 by olasslfioa tions since such rosters are furnished periodically.NOT TO BE ISSUED REFER READER TO IOR kie^ 1Slo NOT FOR DIRECT PHOTOCOPYING COPIES MAY BE ORDERED FROM lo^L Al66r 1/12-0'EM mm t/•5 ik r '$ty*h) I asked the u hief ^ocal -^epresentotive/to visit me v.ith ^r.

The Company understand that the Sheikh agrees to exempt them from all taxation on the lines of the blanket clause as proposed (a copy of which is annexed hereto) subject only to the exemption therefrom of the specific existing taxes enumerated in your letter under reply. The Company note that the Sheikh would welcome the establishment of a Refinery in Bahrein and they are pleased to be able now to say that having regard to the understanding referred to in paragraph three of this letter and to your letter P.Z.6Uk6/35 of the lUth September, they have decided to establish a Refinery in Bahrein. 5« The Company understand that there shall be no freedom from taxation on imported crude oil or the products thereof sold for consumption in Bahrein. 6. It may be explained to the Sheikh, with reference to his wish that the quantity of oil which is produced in Bahrein should not diminish, that while the Company are unable to give any formal assurance that production will be fixed by any specific amount, since this matter depends entirely on commercial considerations, he should be/k. 2. 'be re-assued that the Company have no intention of K neglecting the production of Bahrein oil and that as an earnest of this they have agreed to double the existing minimum royalty. 7. The Company are proceeding forthwith to put into operation their plans for a Refinery in Bahrein. 8. Will you please let me know when you have cabled to the Gulf as the Company desire to publish their decision so soon as you have done so with a delay of a day or two to oermit of the news being formally communicated to the Sheikh by His Majesty's Government. 9. I am putting in hand immediately the drafting of the Deed formally recording the agreement between the parties and I hope to let you have for approval copies of such draft in the course of a few days. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.R. BALLANTYNE. Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.DURRANT'S PRESS CUTTINGS New (York advices report: Whatever else was discussed abroad by Mr. W. C. Teagle, president of Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), who has arrived in New York on the ''Europa,' it is understood that one subject was an amicable arrangement for disposition of oil produced by Standard Oil Company of California on Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf. The trade hears that the position of the latter company is that it has to get a reasonable position in the foreign markets for its Bahrein oil in competition with the product from Iraq. The arrangement considered preferable is for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Royal Dutch-Shell and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to purchase 15,000 to 20,000 barrels daily at least of Bahrein oil, for disposition in the regular channels by these companies. If this is not done, it is understood Standard of California will go into the markets itself. Actual production on Bahrein Island has not reached any such volume. In the first seven months this year pro duction is estimated at 525,000 barrels, an average of about 2,500 barrels daily. Production of the wells is controlled to conform to the sales demand. During 1934 the produc tion amounted to 285,071 barrels, the bulk produced the latter part of the year. Standard of California also has good prospects for production in Saudi Arabia, where the structure appears to be similar to that on the adjacent Bahrein Island.

It is aiso understood that the Standard of New Jersey and the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company are negotiating for e consolidation of their foreign marketing and refining interests.

As we close for press the negotiations regarding the future marketing of crude from Bahrein, and later Eastern Saudi Arabia, are still under way in the I nitcd States. If a satisfactory agreement is reached between the Koyal Dutch-Shell group, the Anglo-Iranian, and the California and Jersey Standard companies, it is hardly likely that a refinery will be built by the Standard Oil Company of Arabia, or by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, except to produce oil for local operations and trade, as required by the terms of the concessions. On the other hand, the Shell, Anglo-Iranian and the Jersey Standard may prefer to take their allocations of the total output in the form of refined products rather than crude oil. In this case the large refinery planned for the Middle East would probably be started shortly for early comple tion. The New York conference is unquestionably aimed at one of those periodical adjustments which have become necessary from time to time in recent years as new sources of crude supply have been found, or as new market factors have appeared on the scene. Success will do much to maintain stabilisation in the oil situation of the Mediterranean, Near East and Middle East. Results will depend upon just how large a share of the distribution is finally demanded by the Standard Oil Company of California, which only threatened to become a world factor in oil loss tlum three vears a? r o —lis . z.8151/35.

Apart from its intrinsic excellence the account of oil exploration in Bahrein and Saudi Arabia whch Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton gives on other pages is of high value because it presents, in short compass, the facts about this subject from an authoritative source. The Standard Oil Company of California, of which the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., is a subsidiary, has from time to time told parts of the romantic story of the finding of oil and the develop ment of an oil field on Bahrein; but Mr. Hamilton fills in a number of blanks and brings matters to date with 17 producing wells and two strings of tools now running. One calls the story a romantic one; and it is so for several reasons, not the least of which is that British capital, which might have developed the Bahrein field, missed its oppor tunity and left the venture to the Standard of California. Another reason is the business enterprise which led this American company to back the effort several thousands of miles away from its headquarters, and where an Ameri can venture was certainly not favourably handicapped. The oil field, however, is an accomplished fact; and the four or five cargoes of crude which (according to the shipping lists) have reached Japan show that it is a world factor. It has been in the news, of course, during the past few weeks, for cables have been fairly frequent to the effect that the large world groups were negotiating concerning the future disposal of Bahrein oil. The report was denied: and it need not concern us further here. We mention it in order to reinforce our remark that Bahrein oil has at tained world importance. — ^346 commercial quantities of oil have been discovere is that of California Arabian Standard Oil Com^ Saudi Arabia. There the company is now engaged ing a test well, situate about six miles inland from coastal village called Khobar, which is iust south of small town called Fort Dammam and which on an Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton. is about 20 miles from Bahrein. At the last repoi this well was 2,190 ft. deep. Several very enco shows of oil have been encountered in the last fe dred feet; but as yet the well has not reached the at which it is hoped oil will be discovered in sub quantities. The encouraging shows of oil have be substantial character, and sufficient, perhaps, to g to erroneous reports that the company has enco oil in tremendous amounts. SCIENTIFIC WORK. The Saudi Arab concession was granted only years ago, in July, 1933. Geological work commt few months later with three field parties of two me accompanied by soldiers and guides. An aei equipped with photographic apparatus was also sc the country; and it has been of great help in reconnaissance work. As a result of the work thus far done by the gee operating men and equipment were moved into Arabia towards the end of last year and made the sary preparations to drill the test well, which is kr Dammam No. 1 well. Within a few months water • veloped, a pier and roads were constructed, a car started, and material moved in. Actual drilling at the end of April of this year. While the car being prepared the men lived under canvas. Th ' . V/ .rJ\ ( IV/ f November 7, 1935. ■' OIL NEWS. EXPLORING FOR OIL IN THE PERSIAN GULF. Interesting Address by Mr. L. N. Hamilton to the Oil Industries Club. On Tuesday, at the monthly luncheon of the Oil Indus tries Club, held at the Great Eastern Hotel, London, E.C.2, Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton gave an address on the above subject. Incidentally he described a motor-car trip across country from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea—a trip made by special favour of the King of Saudi Arabia, and permitted to very few foreigners. The part of Mr. Hamilton's address which is most interesting and impor tant to the oil fraternity was as follows:— Fortunately for you, the subject, 'Exploring for Oil in the Persian Gulf' is a considerably larger one than I intend to cover. I am going to limit myself to some remarks about oil activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Com pany, Ltd., and California Arabian Standard Oil Com pany. The former company, which conducts the venture at Bahrein, is a British company formed under the laws of Canada. The enterprise in Saudi Arabia, quite separate from the Bahrein show, is being conducted by California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which is an American company. The Bahrein group of seven islands are located some 300 miles south of the head of the Persian Gulf and about 20 to 25 miles from the mainland of Saudi Arabia. The main island is some 27 miles long, and ten miles wide at its greatest width. A second island, called Sitra, which is about 3 miles by 1 mile, is separated from the main island by only a narrow channel. Muharraq Island, in size about 4 miles by one-half mile, is located about a mile from the main island. Incidentally I am told that Muharraq is perhaps the best landing field on the Imperial Airways route between Croydon and India. The remain ing islands of the Bahrein group are of no great impor tance. NATURE OF THE ISLANDS. They are desert islands, comparatively fiat, the highest point reaching about 443 ft. above sea level on the main island. Only about l/20th of the total area is under cultivation in the way of date palms and gardens, and this is made possible by the presence of a fairly bountiful supply of fresh water which has been developed by digging and drilling wells. Some of you may be interested to know that there are fresh water springs in the Persian Gulf near the islands; and formerly the natives used to dive and fill goat-skins with fresh water from under the sea. The population of the islands is probably around 120,000; and perhaps one-quarter to one-third of these people live in Manama, the principal city, which is at the northern end of the main island. Heretofore the chief industry of Bahrein has been pearl fishing. As many as 500 boats and 15,000 divers have been employed in one season, and the exports of pearls in the best years have been estimated to be worth between four and five million pounds annually. In recent years, however, these figures have been reduced by some 80 per cent., so that naturally the Shaikh of Bahrein has been considerably cheered up by the discovery of oil. BAHREIN: THE FIRST WELL. It was toward the end of May, 1931, that men and equipment arrived in Bahrein to drill the first well. A temporary camp of Nissen huts was constructed between June and October—unfortunately the hottest part of the year. Temperatures during that time range considerably above 100 degs.; and the humidity is extraordinarily high. From November to April the weather is cooler and the company has, in fact, recorded temperatures as low as 43 degs. Drilling of the first well was begun about the middle of October, 1931, and the well was completed as a producer on June 1, 1932, at a depth of 2,008 ft. Incidentally this well is now being deepened in an exploratory attempt to find some production at a greater depth. Besides the first well, some 16 producing wells have been completed^in the last few years; and at present drilling is being continued with two strings of tools. A permanent camp has also been built, which, besides an office, shops, etc., comprises 19 individual cottages for the employees, and quarters for bachelors. In the way of recreation there is, of course, a club-house in which sound apparatus has been installed for exhibiting modern motion pictures. There are also tennis courts and a golf course. While I know very little about golf, the course impressed me as one very large bunker, the so-called fairways of which are sand-and-rock-ways and the 'greens' of which are 'blacks,' i.e., they are made of oiled sand. TOPPING PLANT AND PIPE LINE. A small topping plant has also been installed at which petrol is made principally for the company's own use. Its output is about 1,000 American gallons per day. Terminal facilities and a submarine pipe line were also constructed last year. These comprise three oil tanks of a total capa city of 250,000 barrels, a bilge-water tank to be used if and when necessary for pumping ashore ballast water from tankers, a submarine pipe line a little over three miles long, a shore pumping plant, and mooring facilities at the other end of the line in about 40 ft. of water. For the first 5,700 ft. the line is built on piers above high water. It is a 12-in. line, at the end of which is an 8-in. flexible hose. With the centrifugal pumps on the shore end, actuated by petrol engines, the pumping rate is about 5,700 barrels per hour. There is a channel of something over 30 miles in length leading to the anchorage near Sitra Island. This channel, which has been marked by a light ship and 3 buoys, contains at least 40 ft. of water at low tide, and incidentally it is the channel used by the British Persian Gulf squadron which is now based at Bahrein. ENGLISH-SPEAKING COMMUNITY. At the present time there are only 37 Class 1 employees of the Bahrein company at Bahrein. Preference is being given to employing British, and to date 16 of the 37 are British. Local employees number about 639. The advent of the oil industry has built up the English- speaking community from a few people to some 80 or 90, inckiding the families who are there, so that the social order in Bahrein has undergone quite a change in a relatively short time—in some respects the social existence has been simplified and in others it has become a little more complicated. So much for a very sketchy review of the Bahrein venture to date. IN SAUDI ARABIA.

Per haps those interested in the subject will find that this establishes some kind of record. FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE. Our relations with the Saudi Arab Government and with the people we have encountered there have been very friendly. While the field parties travel with soldiers, and the camp is also policed by soldiers, no large number is required. It takes but a few to evidence the strong arm of the king, who metes out a stern justice to all offen ders. We have never been molested in our work, nor has there been any untoward incident of any consequence. With the king's blessing one is safe in Saudi Arabia. FEW NON-MOHAMMEDANS. It is interesting to note that Saudi Arabia is probably the only large country directly in the path of important commercial routes which is practically closed to non- Mohammedans. Apart from Jedda, on the Red Sea, where there are a limited number of official representatives and business men, there are no non-Mohammedans in the coun try except in two areas, both of which are covered by con cessions to non-Mohammedans. One is in the northern Hedjaz on the west side of the country, where the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate is prospecting for gold—and with considerable hope of success, I am told—and the other is on the eastern side, where California Arabian Standard Oil Company is looking for oil. If these two ventures are successful they should be of considerable help in replen ishing the depleted treasury of the country. The prin cipal source of revenue has been derived from the many pilgrims who visit the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, but the numbers of these have vastly diminished during the lean years since 1929.

Little influence has been exerted by a further increase in the daily average produc tion of crude oil in the U.S.A. for the week to 10 Novem ber, when it was 2,850,600 barrels, against 2,802,250 in the preceding week. Ihere was some reduction in Cfili fornia after the steady rise for many weeks, but this was offset by a large increase in Oklahoma and smaller rises in other important centres. Expectations of an increase in the price of Mid-Continent crude oil have not yet been fulfilled, but the price of Pennsylvania crude oil has been raised by 15 cents a barrel—the second advance of this amount in two weeks. Owing to the interim dividend disappointment Shells are slightly lower on the week at 82s., after fluctuations, for they have been as low as TTs. (id., while before the decision they attained 83s. 9d., the highest price since 1930. Royal Dutch have shown rather similar fluctua tions, but recovered smartly towards the close to 2&lt;) , l . Anqlo-Iranians at 68s. have been rather dull. The decision to drill for oil in Britain has naturally not been a market factor, despite its importance from a national standpoint; and there are doubts as to the manner in which this company might be affected if sanctions against Italy are extended to cover oil products. Apparently the adverse possibilities have been somewhat exaggerated. Trinidad Leaseholds continue a good feature with a further rise to 83s. 9d. Optimistic estimates are in circu lation regarding the effect on this company of a rise in British petrol prices, and should this occur it seems quite reasonable to expect a further rise in the shares. Shell Unions have been strong and are discussed in a separate note. Other good features have been provided by Phoenix £1 shares at 9s. 3d., Apex Trinidads at 22s., and Attacks, which have moved up again to 25s., despite continued absence of further drilling news. Anglo- Ecuadorians have been in favour at 25s. on the fulfilment of dividend hopes. Royal Dutch and Shell Dividends Delay I n view of the optimism recently expressed regarding the possibility of a resumption of interim dividends by Shell Transport, there was disappointment when the directors announced early this week that they had de cided to defer a decision for the present. The recent steady rise in Shells and other leading shares has been due largely to interim dividend anticipations, and some perplexity as to the exact significance of the announce ment has been expressed. No statement as regards an interim dividend is considered necessary by the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company at the present juncture, and it is believed in Amsterdam that further meetings to consider the matter may be held in the middle of De cember. In that centre it is suggested that a 4% pay ment may be then forthcoming. Shell has not paid an interim dividend since 1930, when 10% interim was forthcoming in accord with the then well-established practice. The final dividend for that year, however, was cut to 7%%. For the following three years single payments of 7^% were distributed each time, but for 1934 one dividend of 125% was distributed. These payments are tax free. Two reasons are advanced as possible explanations for deferring a decision. The favourite theory appears to be that the directors are taking into consideration the possibility that sanctions against Italy may be extended to include oil products—a step which presumably would have an adverse effect on the volume of deliveries of oil by the group. The other reason for a cautious attitude may be the fear of further untoward currency develop ments. For instance, if Holland had to depart from the gold standard a large non -recurring loss might be in flicted upon the Royal Dutch-Shell group, if the experi ence of 1981, when Britain departed from the gold standard, is any criterion. Apart from this specific ad verse possibility the general situation as regards foreign currencies is certainly difficult for a group with such wide spread international interests. Shell Unions O ne of the best features in the oil share market this week has been Shell Union common shares of no par value which, following on attention drawn to the position in these notes and elsewhere, have advanced steadily from $10 in the middle of October to |15 this week. In view of the improvement in the oil position in the U.S.A. it is now being suggested that preferred dividend arrears of the company will be cleared off soon, thus paving the way to a resumption of dividends on the common shares, which have had nothing since 70 cents a share for 1930. Perhaps the market is a little too optimistic in fore shadowing early repayment of all preferred dividend arrears, since these amount to $23.37 a share, while the net earnings per preferred share in the first three-quarters of 1935 were $9.70. Some reduction in the arrears may perhaps be reasonably expected, although it is not quite clear how this can be effected without first dealing with the very large accumulated deficit to profit and loss brought forward from previous years. No doubt the rise in the common shares will continue in view of the optimis tic tendency of Wall Street, but the preferred stock, which carries 5^% cumulatiA e dividend, should also be worth attention at 111. Anglo-Ecuadorian Dividend F or the year to 30 June Anglo-Ecuadorian Oilfields is to pay 7|% dividend, a distribution which is up to the best market expectations, and which appears to justify in considerable measure the steady rise which has lately occurred in these shares. This week there was a further improvement in the quotation to 25s., and at this level the yield, allowing for Is. 6d. gross dividend in the price, is a trifle over 6%. For the year to 30 June, 1934, the dividend was 5%, and this was earned with a small margin, while in four previous years dividends of 3|% each time had been paid. There was a blank in the year to 30 June, 1931, but it appears as if prosperity is at length attending the steady and cautious development policy of this undertaking, which is under the same con trol as Lobitos Oilfields. The 1933-34 profit included £13,365 profit on sale of investments, and this item may prove to have no counterpart in the last financial year, for which the issue of a report is now imminent. Hence, the increased dividend may betoken a substantially in creased operating profit. Sanctions and the Oil Industry T he enforcement of sanctions against Italy as from Monday last has drawn attention to the possibility that the economic measures may later be extended to include the cutting off of oil supplies. This would be such a serious blow to the Italian campaign in Abyssinia that it may not be embarked on without mature consideration, but the League of Nations sub-committee is to consider next week an extension of the embargo to oil, steel, etc. The main oil exporting countries within the League of Nations are Russia and Roumania, which have been large suppliers of Italy in the past. Persia, otherwise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, has also been prominent. However, it seems that only a small proportion of the /MADURRANI'S PRESS CUTTINGS St. Andrew's House, 32 to 34 HoSborn Viaduct, and 3 St. Andrew Street, Holborn Circus, E.C.I.

F ollowing the abortive disappointing results ot the New York conference on the question of purchase of Bahrein and Eastern Saudi Arabian crude by several of the major oil companies, the Bahrein Petroleum Company is proceeding actively with its plans for the construction of its new 10,000-barrel refinery on Bahrein Island, to which we made reference a fortnight ago. The work is to be started next month, and will probably be completed in six months. This perhaps will prove a record for the building of a large refinery on what is almost a barren island, thou sands of miles from manu facturing centres, and at least 12,000 miles from the oil company's headquarters. Constructional work is being carried out by the Standard Oil Company of California's organisation on behalf of its subsidiary—the Bahrein Petroleum Com pany, Ltd. Already nearly 100 British and American engineers have been sent to Bahrein to take care of the erection and to train and direct native labour. It is possible, we learn, tha t anot her short sub marine pipeline will have to be laid toTiandTe tTie refined products. Plans call for the erection of a 1,000 kw. power plant, consisting of three 500 b.h.p. Diesel engines coupled to 335 kw. generators. In addition, prices are being obtained in Europe and the United States on a 400 b.h.p. slower speed Diesel engine for pump operating purposes. The refinery tank farm will consist of 18 fioating-root tanks of 55,000-barrel capacity each, installed with the usual fire protection equipment. For several months officials yf the California Standard, including Mr. F. H. Dittus, rliief refinery engineer, have been visiting European engineering works, obtaining costs on certain equipment for the refinery, and Mr^T. W. Barrington, of the San Franciso purchasing department, is now at the London office in charge of buying. An interesting development of the company's over seas operations is the recent formation in Great Britain of the California Stan dard Oil Company LM. Mr. H. 1).

Dear Mr. Ballontyne, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the r9tii ITovember, 1935, (Y ?hich I am sorry not to have answered before) enclosing a draft deed for modifying the 1934 lease of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. We have decided that on the whole it would be desirable to insert a reference to the determination of the Company to set up a refinery, and we would accordingly propose to put in a new clause as follows: '(A) The Company shall proceed to establish forthwith a refinery at Bahrein. 11 (A) and (B) of the present draft would then become (B) arid (C), end (A) in the third line of the new clause (C) would become (B), Perhaps you would kindly let me know if you agree to this modification. We presume that you will see H.R. Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Company, 11 Birchin Lane, E.C.3. &amp;a, ^ no objection to the word 'forthwith', as the Gompejiy are already, in fact, putting their determination into operation . But if you should have any objection to the word we could no doubt substitute something like 'as soon as possible'. We have already sent advance copies of the draft deed to the authorities in India and in the Gulf, and v ;hen this point has been cleared up we shall, I think, subject to any further observations which they may have to make, be able to have the drait suDiuitteci to the Bahrein Government for its consideration.

T.C.FowleeFtANOTHER STEP IN THE BAHREIN DEVELOPMENT ON November 14th the Company an nounced placement of orders for equip ment for the construction of a refinery on the Island of Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf, where the Company has developed an oil field through its subsidiary The Bahrein Petroleum Company. The initial unit of the refinery will have a capacity of 10,000 bar rels daily, and will be so built that it will be possible readily to double this capacity to 20,000 barrels daily. The refinery will pro duce principally gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil and fuel oil. It is expected that it will be possible to begin operations next July. The Company acquired an exclusive con cession of 100,000 acres in Bahrein in 1930. After a geological survey drilling was started in 1931 and oil was discovered in June, 1932. Today there are 16 producing wells and 6 drilling. It is estimated that more than 10,000 acres have already been proven as oil bear ing, and that the field now has a potential production of 50,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Production has recently approximated 6500 barrels daily. Bahrein offers a splendid strategical loca tion for a refinery so far as markets are con cerned. There is large consumption of pe troleum products in countries eastward to Singapore, including India, with its popu lation of 400,000,000, westward to Suez, south along the east coast of Africa, and in South Africa. Trade may also be developed in the Far East. The Bahrein Islands constitute an inde pendent Sheikhdom, now governed by Sheikh Hamad, of the Khalifah family, some mem ber of which has ruled here ever since 1783, when the powerful mainland tribe to which it belonged, the Utibi Arabs, seized the land from the Persians. Since 1861', Great Britain has acted as friend and protector of the rul ing Sheikh, although, strictly speaking, Bah rein is not a British protectorate. The Island of Bahrein is some thirty miles long by ten miles wide, and has an area of 208 square miles. The total population of the islands is estimated to be around 175,000 people.I 4 hi Aft ij' DURRAMT'S PRESS GUTTING St. Andrew's House, 32 to 34 Holborn Viaduct, and 3 St. Andrew Street, Holborn Circus, E.C.I.

L Lieut-Colonel, Politica Agent, Bahrain,Drilling Can Granting of Perm Areas Marks Ifegii tion to Determine Commercial Value\ w%^th the granting by the British g ernment of 30 drilling licenses covering area of 5,400 square miles in 11 Engl counties, the way is opened for a syste atic exploration of possible petrole resources in the United Kingdom, T permits were issued to the D'Arcy 1 ploration Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and located in Surrey, Sussex, Hampsh Dorset, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, Lincc shire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestersh Rutland, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk Some twenty other drilling appli tions are under consideration and pern for some or all of these are to be issi subsequently. When the areas cove by these licenses have been tested by drill it is anticipated that a reasona clear answer will be supplied to the mi debated question whether Great Brit possesses indigenous oil deposits wo developing. That expectations in this direction not over sanguine is indicated by the lowing statement issued by the Anj Iranian Oil Company: After considering the scientific &lt; dence collected by the geologists garding the possibility of the existe in the United Kingdom of conditi favourable for the accumulation petroleum, the company has deci» that there is a sufficient case to jus^ investigation by test drilling, in a{ tion to further geological and g physical work. The geological conditions, in so as they are at present known, do suggest extensive deposits, but it recognised that a special value wo attach to indigenous oil, even if the i covery were limited to relatively sn commercial quantities. The drill alone can determine whet or not such deposits do, in fact, ex The company has acquired licer over a number of areas, and will be its operations by drilling in the Sotio. &lt;L ii u s s BAHREIN, tanker ivith a capacity of 7,095 gross tons formerly the s s R.

Plant on Bahrein Island—Design Permits Doubling Capacity If Required—British and American Engineers Employed. F ollowing the disappointing results of the New York conference on the ques tion of purchase of Bahrein and Eastern Saudi Arabian crude by several of the major oil companies, the Bahrein Pe troleum Company Ltd. is proceeding actively with its plans for the construction of a 10,000 bbl. refinery on the island of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf. In fact, the work, which started in December, is being so expedited that it will probably be completed in six months. Perhaps this will prove a record for the building of so large a plant thousands of miles from manufacturing centers and at least 12,000 miles (almost exactly half-way around the world) from the company's headquarters. Arrangements are being made to facilitate doubling the size of the refinery at an early date if circumstances warrant. Construction work is being carried out by experts from the Standard Oil Com pany of California's organization, loaned to its subsidiary. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. Already about fifty British and American engineers and ex pert mechanics have been sent to Bahrein to take care of the erection of this plant and to train and direct local workmen. A 12 in. submarine line for loading crude was completed in 1933. This will be paralleled with another 12 in. line to make a double line system for loading all black oils. A second 8 in. and 10 in. double line system will be installed for loading white products. There will be no cracking units for the present. Plans call for the erection of a 2,000 KW power plant consisting of three 250 KW Diesel sets and one 1,250 KW steam turbo-generator set. In addition prices are being obtained in the United States for three 200 hp gasoline engines for pump operation. It is evident that welding will be extensively used, as it is reported that one large order for welding equip ment has been placed in America for ship ment to Bahrein. The refinery tank farm will consist of 600,000 barrels of tankage installed with the usual fire pro tection equipment. For several months officials of the Standard of California have been visiting European engineering works obtaining costs on certain equipment for this refinery. An interesting development of the company's overseas operations is the recent formation in Great Britain of the California Standard Oil Company, Ltd. H. D. Collier has been appointed Chair man. Offices are at 6, Lothbury, London, JANUARY • 1936 19Hrilling f'ainpaign Anllioriv.ctl in Britain Granting of Permits Covering Twelve Separate Areas Marks Beginning of Systematic Explora tion to Determine Existence of Oil Deposits of Commercial J alue. \\ ' ith the granting by the British gov ernment of 30 drilling licenses covering an area of 5,400 square miles in 11 English counties, the way is opened for a system atic exploration of possible petroleum resources in the United Kingdom. The permits were issued to the D'Arcy Ex ploration Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and are located in Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, Lincoln shire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. Some twenty other drilling applica tions are under consideration and permits for some or all of these are to be issued subsequently. When the areas covered by these licenses have been tested by the drill it is anticipated that a reasonably clear answer will be supplied to the much debated question whether Great Britain possesses indigenous oil deposits worth developing. That expectations in this direction are not over sanguine is indicated by the fol lowing statement issued by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company: After considering the scientific evi dence collected by the geologists re garding the possibility of the existence in the United Kingdom of conditions favourable for the accumulation of petroleum, the company has decided that there is a sufficient case to justify investigation by test drilling, in addi tion to further geological and geo physical work. The geological conditions, in so far as they are at present known, do not suggest extensive deposits, but it is recognised that a special value would attach to indigenous oil, even if the dis covery were limited to relatively small commercial quantities. The drill alone can determine whether or not such deposits do, in fact, exist. The company has acquired licences over a number of areas, and will begin its operations by drilling in the South of England. In certain other districts much geological and geophysical survey work remains to be undertaken, and a decision as to whether drilling is justi fied there will depend on the results of such work. That oil is present in limited quantities in different parts of the United Kingdom is shown by the seepages which occur in the coal seams of various mines and in cer tain other places. As long ago as 1847 James Y oung, a Scotch chemist, paved the way for the world's mineral oil industries by refining oil obtained from a Derbyshire coal mine. When this supply was ex hausted he succeeded in distilling oil from a certain type of coal found in the Lothians. Subsequently he turned his attention to the Scottish oil shales from which oil is still being produced by Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Co. Ltd. of which he was the founder. The company is now associated with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd. through Scottish Oils, Ltd. Following the world war, in 1918-19, an attempt was made by the Cowdray inter ests to discover oil by drilling. These activities were fully described by World Petroleum in July, 1934. A well at Hardstoft was brought in, and in the in tervening period has produced some '1,000 bbl. of oil. It is still in operation, yielding a high grade oil which commands a premium in the British market. In fact, the highest price ever paid for crude oil was made by the Anglo-American Oil Co. many years ago, because of its lube-oil content. Previous to 1934 three licenses to drill for oil in England had been issued. The oldest of these, granted in 1923, was held by the Duke of Devonshire who had ac quired ownership of the Hardstoft well. In 1930 a license was granted to Henry King Hiller, whose operations were in the locality of Heathfield, Sussex, where gas was obtained. A third license was issued in 1931 to the N. M. D. Syndicate which Oil flowing from Hardstoft No. 1 in EnglaruB on June 3, 1919. I he well is now on pnnipk for small production. drilled to a depth of 2,000 ft. at Threet Bridges, Sussex. In 1934 Parliament passed the Petro-j leum (Production) Act which established the right of the nation to all oil resources within the country and established defi nite conditions to govern the granting of permits for exploration and drilling. This legislation stimulated renewed interest in the subject and a large number of applica tions were received. The drilling permits granted last November were issued under the terms of this law. Among geologists, opinion inclines to the belief that while oil may be discovered in the United Kingdom, it will be found in small quantities and that no extensive field is likely to be uncovered.

Dear Mr. Clauson, x I refer to the second paragraph of your letter P.Z.8151/35 of the 14th November last. You say in that letter that you understand the Sheikh of Bahrein is anxious to know whether the Company has any form of 'Sales Agreement' with competitors in connection with the sale of oil, petrol and so on, in Bahrein. You add that the sheikh naturally v/ishes that his people should benefit from a local refinery by getting petrol and other products cheaper than at the present imported rates and would be glad to be informed of the position in this respect, and you ask that the Company should give you any information it can on this subject. As I informed you on the telephone on the 6th January last, this Company has replied to your enquiry to the effect that it expects to be making kerosene and other petroleum products at the Bahrein Refinery by the early part of 1937 which it is no^u-ixee to sell in Bahrein at prices to be fixed by itself. In other words, the Company is not involved at this time in any cartel or agreement to sell or not to sell products of the Bahrein Refinery at any fixed price. I also informed you that the Company will continue to keep in mind so far as its ability extends, the best interests of the Sheikh and his Subjects and therefore, in Clauson, Esq. , India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.answering a general question of this kind, the Company reserves to itself entire liberty of action in the L^r^uoin 0 of bo oh the natural and manufactured produce.

Four of the smniL tanks for the refined proaucts have been completed in so far as they can be. One of the large tanks is complete and the floating roof is being installed. The other three large tanks are taking shape raplnly and one is nearly complete. Work is almost at a standstill on the tanks for lack of material which is expected to arrive at thp eV y.r * br^r. . I had a long talk with a man who seemed to be a foreman fitter from Glasgow. He was very critical of both the material used and the workmanship on erections, de said no English firm would put up with it. He said material from ^er.any should have been cast to measurement, and not bent or cut as it is on arrival here. In England all material for tanks is cast piece by piece to exact measurement and fitted on the site of erection. He 3c;lc tnat rivetting and welding was very poor, c ' r ' ;:e 1 no ' !: think any of the tanks would hold oil. ^e said the inside pressure would cause leaks which must lead to ever lasting repairs. 4. He pointed to an American welder under his orders who was fixing the foundation plates. This welder had one plate 1/52' out oi true and when made to do the Job over again complained of English fijpkitiness, and said that it was quite good enough for America. Eventually he was made to understand tnat 1/32' at the bottom meant an 1' out of true on the top oi t e tank vnich would lead to jamming o^ the floating roof. Altogether he was very critical of the rush methods employed and said that no English firm would attempt such a construction in the time. They would take two years and turn out a refinery worth having, ^his refinery vill be up in six months and take six years repairing.

February 22, 1936. clearly marked in the production figures for 1929-31, but recovery commenced earlier than for the world as a whole. If we consider Near East production as having become stabilised in 1917, we find that the average rate of increment of production over the 11-year period, 1917-28, is 17.8 per cent, per annum, as compared with 9 per cent, for world production over the same period. These figures, by the way, represent the abnormally accelerated demand which immediately followed the war. For the three-year period, 1932-35, the average increment is 16.3 per cent, per annum, as compared to 7.6 per cent, previously quoted for world production over the same period. In this connection, the figures for another compara tively new producing centre—^Venezuela—may be of interest. From 1921 (218,000 m. tons) to 1929 (19,845,000 m.tons) the average rate of increment in production was 75.8 per cent, per annum ! This tremendous increase was offset (fortunately for the oil industry) by a correspondingly rapid decline in Mexican production over the same period. Nevertheless, the effect on United States output was marked. Saturation of Markets. Much has been written around the subject of the saturation of markets, in both the oil and other indus tries, but the predicted maxima have so often been exceeded that most of the prophets have retired to cleanse their dust-filled mouths. The world production data for oil definitely oppose any suggestion of possible saturation and, in fact, show that the consumption of 100 barrels of oil in any one year is followed the next year by the demand for over 108 barrels. That this fact has not been universally recognised is due, probably, to the confusion between oil produced and oil consumed. The first is comparable to gold in a stocking, the second to gold released for industrial purposes and earning interest. To continue the analogy, if we force on the banks more gold than industry can usefully absorb, the interest gained is immediately reduced. So with oil until, as has happened often in the past, the market will accept it only at an uneconomically low price. The obvious remedy is to induce new legitimate consumption of oil by every possible means, so that the rate of increase of demand can be accelerated. The remarkable stability of the figure of around 8.05 per cent, for this annual increase raises doubts, however, as to whether it can materially be bettered by any of the methods at present used for boosting oil sales. It has remained practically constant from the time when kerosene was king in the oil world, and when gasoline was an obnoxious by-product. The advent of the gasoline engine has scarcely affected it, nor has the increasing use of heavy oils in compression-ignition engines and for boiler firing. Having survived such funda mental changes, is there any hope that the figure can bo augmented—or must the oil industry be satisfied with an increase of demand at the compound rate of 8.05 per cent, per annum ? If the latter is true, the only solution is to restrict the increase in the world production of petroleum to that figure by international agreement—that, or chaos! The Trends of Oil Demand. Let us discuss what guidance we can obtain from statistics as to the possibilities of new markets and new demands. We shall first deal with the United States, which is at once the world's greatest producer and consumer :— 1890 1900 1910 KWO Population.

This decline in consumption, like the world decline in production, must be considered as an aftermath of the Great War. It is comparable to the exhaustion which, in a human being, follows artificial stimulation. The consumption of petroleum per capita in the United States is now fluctuating around the easily remembered figure of one metric ton per annum. It is facile, but quite illogical when all points are considered, to suggest that it represents a saturation point. The consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom amounted to 9,146,698 metric tons in 1933, which is equivalent to 0.19 m. tons per head. In 1934 the figure was 10,310,146 m. tons, which corresponds to 0.22 m. tons per capita, allowing for the change in population. It must be conceded that these consumptions per head are well below any conceivable maxima. On the other hand, it must be remembered that Great Britain adopts an extremely conservative attitude to any fundamental changes in industry. Quite apart from political con siderations, therefore, any sudden change in the average annual rate of increment of the demand for petroleum products (11.1 per cent, from 1933 to 1935) is not to be expected. This average figure, by the way, does not take into account domestically produced oils, which are now assuming significant proportions. The absorption of any abnormally rapid increase in production, such as is now occurring in the Near East, must be looked for in other directions. Where is Near East oil to be absorbed ? New Markets. The obvious and convenient market for surplus Near East oil is Africa. This continent, with an area of 11.5 million square miles and an estimated population of 150,000,000, imported, in 1934, only 755,357 m. tons of petroleum products. Of this, 509,753 m. tons were taken by the Union of South Africa, which has an estimated population of 8,000,000. The consumption per head per annum is, therefore, 0.064. m. tons for the Union, and 0.005 m. tons per head per annum for the whole of the continent!

THE PETROLEUM TIMES. 243 Influence of Increased Near East Production on World Markets. j Delayed Effect of Great War on Consuming W 1 Power.—A Critical Analysis of World Statistics. By L. Owen, A.R.C.S., A.R.S.M., D.I.C., M.Inst.P.T. Whenever new prolific production of crude petroleum occurs in any part of the globe, a world-wide redistribu tion of the avenues of supply inevitably becomes neces sary. This adjustment of the world's oil arteries to cope with a new supply has not depended solely on the economics of production and delivery costs, but is affected, in a major degree, by political considerations. Agreements between the various large producers and distributors may alleviate, to some extent, the chaos and financial loss caused by the throwing of new pro duction on to a world market unprepared for it, but such adjustments invariably take time to have practical effect. A period of uneconomic confusion—more or less prolonged—is the certain result. Temporarily, the consumer may benefit by a reduction in price of the various petroleum products, but the final balance-sheet is adverse to consumer, to producer and to industry alike. This fact has been proved, time and again, in the oil business, where the potentialities of new fields depend upon so many uncertain factors that they are virtually unpredictable in any detail. The East Texan oil flood in 1933 may be quoted as a recent and relevant example. The Trend of World Production. A critical analysis, however, of the statistics of world production of oil—and of its corollary, world con sumption—leads to important conclusions from which the effect of new production can be deduced. Let us consider the following table :— World Change crude oil from Year. production preceding in period. metric tons. Per cent. 1880 4,104,000 .. — 1890 .. 10,263,000 ,. .. +150 1900 19,857,000 ,. .. +93 1910 .. 44,932,000 .. .. +126 1920 .. 96,910,000 ,, ,, +115 1930 .. 196,475,000 .. .. +105 The average increase for each 10-year period is seen to be 117 per cent., and the average annual rate of increment over the 50 years covered by the table is 8.05 per cent. The variations on either side of this figure are strikingly small, particularly when it is remem bered that the table covers the period of dislocation (1914-18) of the Great War, and that the end of the last decade in the table was marked by a decline in production. This decline, in the final analysis, must be attributed to the industrial exhaustion caused by the war, which was not fully felt until 1929—a lag of 15 years. It persisted to 1933, as shown by the table below :— World Change crude oil from Year. production in metric tons. preceding period. Per cent. 1929 .. 205,135,000 ,. _ 1930 .. 196,475,000 .. .. - 4,2 1931 .. 189,541,000 .. .. 1932 180,855,000 ,. ,. - 4,6 1933 .. 197,048,000 .. .. +9,0 1934 .. 20^118*000 .. .. +5,6 1935 (es ltd,) .. 225,000,000 .. .. + 8,1 It will be seen that the average annual increment for the last three years is 7.6 per cent., which agrees closely with the figure of 8.05 per cent, for the 50 years, 1880-1930. This remarkable constancy in the rate of increase of production—and consequently consumption—of petro leum, over a period representing nearly the whole existence of oil production and distribution as an organised industry, points to one definite conclusion. That is, that the world tolerance to petroleum consump tion, except under conditions of extreme abnormality, is represented by a cumulative annual increase of approximately 8.05 per cent. Given less, the consumer starves ; given more, he Near East Production. How greatly the present-day Near East production differs from this average world - requirement is illus trated by the figures in the table below. 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1980 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935* Iran, 25,000 80,000 .. 229,000 .. 356,000 .. 438,000 .. 605,000 .. 847,000 .. 1,071,000 .. 1,337,000 .. 1,680,000 .. 2,216,000 .. 2,846,000 .. 3,582,000 .. 4,246,000 .. 4,573,000 .. 4,839,000 .. 5,310,000 .. 5,719,000 .. 5,548,000 .. 6,034,000 .. 5,825,000 .. 6,549,000 .. 7,200,000 .. 7,658,000 .. 7,425,000 Estimated. ast production in metric tons, Egypt.

In the not distant future, however, Russia will be called upon to supply the demand of Asiatic U.S.S.R. This, at present, is negligible, but it cannot remain so when even a small part of its population of 54,000,000 becomes road-minded. A hiarket, further afield but still easily reached from Russia, the Near East and the United States, is China, with an estimated population of 420,0^0,000 and an annual import of under 1.000,0&lt; H) m. tons of petroleum [ »ro- ducts. In 1934 it was 944,494 m. tons. What a potential market! The suggestion that every minor chief in the Chinese hinterland should be presented with an auto mobile or a light lorry as a gift from the oil industry is not as quixotically generous as might appear at first sight. A despot with a motor vehicle would want roads and would see that he got them. Roads would attract more cars, and the country could become motor-minded and petroleum-hungry. After all, even in Britain, which is, as yet, only beginning to find that the motor-car has passed out of the luxury class, the average consumption of petrol per car per annum is over 2 m. tons, quite apart from the other petroleum products which it consumes, directly and indirectly, Australia, in 1934, imported 1,444,856 m. tons of petro leum in various forms to supply its population of around 6,700,000. This represents 0.21 m. tons per capita. New Zealand, with a population of about 1,550,000, imported 426,113 m. tons, or 0.27 m. tons per capita. These demands, although far in advance of those of Africa and China, are a long way from any possible saturation figure. Problems and Possible Solutions. The real problem which faces the Near East petroleum producers—and world producers in general—is not due to a lack of markets, but to the lack of means for acceler ating demand. In the past, the oil industry has been content to pro duce and market its oil and, in all essential particulars, it has let the demand look after itself. This policy of laisser faire —comfortable enough as long as it remains effective—is probably the major factor which controls the constancy of the figure of 8.05 per cent, per annum increment for petroleum demand. If that policy is still pursued, the only thing that can save the industry from chaos is drastic international proration. Even if feasible, this would be a very difficult and unpleasant—if not dangerous—operation, as far as the legitimate oil industry is concerned, quite apart from putting fortunes in the pockets of ' hot ' oil organisations. Another solution is to organise a co-operative and intensive drive to make the world oil-conscious, and the easiest way of doing this is by the provision of roads to link every centre of population. The big oil organisa tions could aid road construction either by direct loans bearing low interest charges, or by the guarantee of loans raised for such purposes. They would receive, in exchange, monopolies for the marketing of petroleum products.

O C jl^C S^ I enclose a copy of a note regarding a conversation with Mr.Ballantyne on the subject of (a) the Unallotted Area oi Bahrein, and (b) the marketing arrangements being made by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As regards (a), we must presumably leave the Bahrein Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited to light it out with the Sheikh. As regards (b), Mr.Ballantyne pointed out that it was not lor him as a servant of the Company to suggest that His Majesty's Government might want to make any requests to the Company or comment on their scheme, but the Company were particularly anxious that His Majesty 's Government ohould be fully informed, and it occurred to him that it would be in the best ultimate interests of the Company that His Majesty's Government should be quite satisfied that their interests were not going to be adversely affected by the/ ijl2. the importation of a new principle which might conceivably at some later stage lead to undesirable complications, I understand that the Texas Company are themselves a most respectable organisation and purely American (Starling vill be able, of course to confirm whether this is the wase) but their importation into the Bahrein Company means that they will have a share not only in the marketing but also in the producing side of the business and this might presumsbly lead to further developments, e.g. if the Texas Company subsequently got attached to some other perhaps not American Company, (perhaps Japanese) which might not be desirable from His Majesty's Government's point of vjbw. It might be worth considering whether we should intimate to the Bahrein Petroleum Company that while His Majesty's Government quite appreciate that it is necessary lor the Company to make arrangements to market its oil (ancl t.-iis is a.11 co the good so lar as the Sheikh's revenues ai*e concerned) His Majesty's Government view with som® disquiet the introduction of new interests into the Bahrain x l ..roleum Company, and they look to the Company to ensur# by some/^yo~y 3. some appropriate means that His Majesty's Government are safeguarded from the possibility of further outside bodies acquiring interests in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. They would, for instance, suggest that provision might be made whereby none of the share capital of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could be alienated without the consent of His Majesty's Government, and that the capital could not be increased without similar consent. This of course is a very tentative suggestion for consideration. The papers are being referred to our Legal Adviser for his observations and in the meantime I should be glad if you would kinHy let me know whether you have any observations o offer on the scheme or on the line that Hie Majesty's Government might take in regard to future safeguards. is, of course, possible that if the Bahrein Petroleum uompany get the unallotted area in Bahrein, the main lease will have to be amended to cover the new holding.

Mr. Ballantyne called yesterday afternoon on his return from San Francisco where he has been conferring with the principals of Standard Oil of California. He had two points to raises (1) The unallott e d are a. He said that the Company had definitely decided to acquire the unallotted areay and instructions have been sent to Skinner, the chief local representative, accordingly. He is to enquire froin the Bahrein Government what procedure is necessary to deal with the matter in view of the Sheikh's absence. The Company are hopeful that they may be able to make an offer to the Sheikh which may clinch the matter definitely. I said that this, of course, is a matter for the Sheikh and that K.H.G. have, as he knows, been quite neutral in the matter allalong. My impression was that the negotiations would probably have to mark time until the Sheikh returned to Bahrein, as ix was unlikely that His Excellency would have time or be prepared to do anything while he was in this country, and it would clearly not be possible to do much in Bahrein in the absence of the Sheikh. Mr. Ballantyne said that would quite suit the Company and that in any case Mr. Skinner would be reporting to them shortly. (2) Marketing . Referring to certain press statements which had been sade recently (one of which I had mentioned to Mr. Hamilton when/1*0 2. when he called here the other day), Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company were In the final stages of negotiation with the Texas Company for the conclusion of a marketing arrangement. The Texas Company have a wide organisation in (1 think) India, Africa, Australia and South Arabia, and will be able to dispose of as much oil as Standard Oil can produce both in Bahrein and on the mainland of Arabia. The original idea was to have a holding company in London, but after careiully considering the question of income tax in England, the United States and Canada, the Company had come to the conclusion that the soundest and most economical methOu of setting up the marketing organisation was not to create a new company, but to extend the functions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to cover the marketing as well as the production of oil. The scheme is that half the share capital of the Company will be acquired by the Texas Company. The Bahrein Petroleum Company will continue to exist precisely as ai: present constituted and all that would happen would be a redistribution of capital, either by an increase oi the capital or by the sale of some of the existing capital. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company wished to have no secrets irom H.M.G. and, though they were, of course &gt; under no obligation to do so, were anxious that H.M.G. should he fully informed of the arrangements that were in contemplation. it might be that H.M.G. might have some comments to make from their own point of view and, of course, if so, the Company would be prepared to give them careful consideration. INDIA 01 PICE. 20th June, 1936. M.J.CLAUSON.' '1 w Note on the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Texas Company. /. There have been numerous rumours current in Bahrain regarding a possible deal betii/een tue Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Texas Company. The rumours are of two classess- (a) That an amalgamation wi^l take place between the Companies with the object of Texas finding a market for Bahrain refined oil# (b) That tiie Texas Company will buy out the Bahrain Petroleum Company and although the name and registration will not be changed it will in fact become a part of t;ie Texas concern. cJ. There are various indications that some alteration in the status of the Bahrain Petroleum Company is contemplated (a) The general talk in the ^new camp 1 * among the employees is on the subject of individual 1 s personal position when Texas tatoes over and how they will be affected. (b) Mr.Phillips^ the head accountant &gt; has had his leave curtailed. This is said to be because he has to have the half-yearly accounts prepared and despatched to reach the United States before the 1st July. (c) Mr. Deacon, the M;nager of the Refinery construction, lias gone to Ceylon and is said to be superintending the preliminary arrangements /— —'-2- arrangements for the erection of a bunkering plant for the Company at Colombo, (d) The Company when asked if there were any foundation in rumours of an increase in the refinery construction were unable to give a satisfactory answer. (e) The Resident Manager when asked by me if he could state who the permanent staff were as opposed to temporary constructional staff was unable to do so as he said things were so much in the air that he did not know what the position was and until he did he would be unable to give a definite answer, (f) A large quantity of gear is said to be being shaped to Hasa and I am informed by a reliable individual tliat any surplus material is being removed as rumours a valuation for the purpose of some financial deal are current.

COMPAIJY LIMITED ' - 'In view of the conjecture now current among execu tives of the international oil groups as to the extent of the intentions of the Standard Oil of California group to expand in world markets, the considerable information as to 1935 developments contained in the annual report will be read with interest. The total domestic and foreign average of developed and un developed oil lands at the end of the year amounted to the appreciable total of 2,195,055 acres, being divided as follows :— Acres.

United States .—The company and its subsidiary, the California Company, operating in Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming, produced a total of 44,539,848 barrels during 1935, a daily average of 122,027 barrels, of which 108,640 barrels daily were produced in California. This is an increase of 18,969 barrels daily, or 18.4 per cent., over 1934. Although drilling was more extensive last year, the greater part of the in creased activity was confined to areas threatened with drainage or because of lease obligations. Developments in California resulted in a material increase in potential production.

The oil is of exceptionally high gravity, and the wells have produced in good volume, indicating a new reseive of substantial value. But it is in the developments outside the United States that the greatest interest lies. The report gives the following information. Bahrein Island .—Development of the company 's liuhlinii.i fli TMim'iii I^MUIU.' Persian Gulf, was continued during the year. Six new weflFxvvee completed, making a total of 19 wells. Production, amounting to 1,264,809 barrels, was curtailed to conform to sales requirements. A total, from current production and storage, of 1,305,184 barrels of crude oil was sold during the year and commitments were made for the sale of approxi mately 3,500,000 barrels of crude during 1936. Preparations were made for the construction of a refinery on Bahrein Island to manufacture petroleum products from Bahrein crude, to be completed in the fall of 1936. The refinery will have a capacity for run ning 10,000 barrels of crude daily. A test was made which indicates the possibility of additional reserves of crude below the previously known producing formations. The original discovery well was deepened and m of 2,832 ft. an encouraging showing of oil was encountered. Saudi Arabia .—During 1935 further geological work was done on the company's concession on the mainland of Saudi Arabia, near Bahrein. Further aeroplane photography and the detailed mapping of structures located the year before in the vicinity of Dammam was accomplished. A well was started during April on the Dammam Bahrein Island refinery under construction—early stages in the erection of the distillation unit.

Marketing. Discussing foreign marketing, the report states that during 1035 the California Standard Oil Company qualified for conducting business in Guatemala and El Salvador, beginning opeiations in the former in Novem ber 1035, and in the latter February last. On July 1st, 1035, the Standard Oil Company ot British Columbia, Ltd., commenced sales operations in British Columbia. The sales facilities of Dominion Oil Company, former provincial distributors of Standard Oil products, were acquired and are being expanded. Sales outlets were also constructed at Edmonton, Alberta, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and products will be sold through dealers. At the end of the year a modern refinery of 2,000 barrels per day crude capacity was completed and placed in operation near Vancouver. Although this did not come within the compass of the 1035 report, reference may here be made to the recent formation of another subsidiary, Ceylon Petroleum Co., Ltd., details of whiclTWre given in this journal on May 16th.

Its interests were enlarged in July by the forma tion in Australia of a wholly owned subsidiary equipped to engage in the manufacture and sale of bituminous emulsions and related products. The domestic subsidiary, American Bitumuls Company, materially expanded its operations in the eastern part of the United States by the addition of two asphalt refineries. During the year a technical development of major importance has been the utilisation ot bituminous emulsion for admixture with soils to render them resistant to moisture absorption. By this patented process, stable road bases and airport surfacings can be prepared at relatively low cost. California Spray-Chemical Corporation .—The company owns a substantial interest in this corporation, which in 1935 further expanded its worldwide marketing organisation. The corporation now has distribution over the entire United States, in all important European fruit-producing centres, in Africa, in the Near East, and in Australia.

During the latter part of 1935 crude over-production in California brought demoralisation to the Pacific Coast oil industry. These conditions brought renewed effort toward curtailment among producers which resulted in a partial restoration of prices in the latter part of the year. Early in 1936 a decided improvement was accom plished, resulting in not only a full restoration in crude oil prices, but an advance which brought prices to the highest levels since 1931 and also restoration of gasoline prices.

Appointment of a Petroleum Commission. Dr. Josef Kopp , the Swiss petroleum geologist, sends us interesting particulars concerning the search ^or oil in Switzerland, a matter whicli is attracting increasing attention. The main points may be sum marised as follows: — Some time ago Dr. Kopp submitted a memorandum to the Swiss National Economic Department, sug gesting the creation of a Swiss Petroleum Commission empowered to initiate exploration with State aid. The proposal found favour with the authorities, and the Central Employment Office formed a geotechnical section, which, in turn, appointed an expert petro leum committee to study the problem. Under these auspices, and with financial support from the Swiss Government and the Canton of Lucerne, Dr. Kopp has already carried out fairly extensive investiga tions in the district between Aarau and Lake Neu- chatel; on lines which proved successful in opera tions in Sumatra, some 40 shallow holes were sunk and many stratal measurements made, with the object of ascertaining the course of the anticlines and synclines. These preliminary examinations, upon which a report may be available by the middle of this year, appear to indicate that the most pro mising sites for drilling are likely to be .on the anti clines of St. Urban-Langenthal and Jens-Mohringen, where there is a prospect of encountering the oil- bearing sandstone at depths of 400 to 000 metres. The exploratory operations sponsored by the Geo technical Section and the expert committee are not connected with the deep drilling already in progress in Switzerland (Fopega Company). Other opinion also favours the possibility of find ing petroleum in Switzerland. A Swiss expert with Texas experience states that he is ' firmly convinced that methodical search would disclose commercially productive oilfields, not only in the ' molasse ' zone, but rather in the older Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic formations. Drilling to depths of 2,000 and 3,000 metres would have to be reckoned with, however. Holes of that kind could be drilled in a few months with modern equipment. A well 2,000 metres deep ought not to cost more than 350,000 francs in Switzerland, and later on 100,000 francs.Political Agency, Bahrain, the gad July 1936, C/SSS~10/1, The Honourable The Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Dear Clauson, Your letter of 33rd June, (P.Z.42I8/36) regarding the Bahrein Petroleum Coinpany. I note what the Company have decided to do with regard to the unallotted area. As regards marketing arrangements, the Texas Company is a substantial and reputable concern, and purely American controlled, with marketing organisations in various parts of the East. It is not associated with the big oil groups, but while preserving its independence, it is in fairly close touch with those groups and I gather is regarded as being on reasonably friendly terms. I have made one or two discreet enquiries as to the views of the big British Companies on the marketing of Bahrein oil because, as I think you know, there were some talks between the big groups and the Standard of California a short time ago which broke down. Broadly, tte view is that, short of a direct arrangement with the Standard of California, there are certain advantages from their point of view in a company like the Texas handling the oil since it will flow into those channels where they normally trade. There will thus be a minimum of disturbance of markets which is all to the good from the point of view..of British oil interests. As 1 egards the question whether we can do anything in the way of securing any further safeguards for H.M. Government, I think we are on difficult ground to try to insist on any new 'uson E sq ., ^ j ^ / Office^ conditions/conditions now, unless your legal advisers were of opinion that to admit the Texas Company to a half share of the capital brought Article XIII into operation. So far as a new concession is concerned, I think our hands are free to consider any reasonable new conditions, but we should have to be careful not to put forward anything to the Bahrein i ?etroleum Company which we would not equally suggest to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in which there are British, French, American and Dutch interests. 'He carried the matter as far as we could when the existing British Control clause was insertea, and the only suggestion which occurs to me at the moment is that we might, as Mr.Ballantyne has asked whether w« have any views, possibly suggest that the Company should giv# us an undertaking that they will not, without our consent, enter into any arrangement which would result in control of the Company being secured by a concern in which American and/or British interests did not hold at least 50 per cent.of the share capital. This is on the assumption that the Bahrein Petroleum Company is to be allowed to have the remainder of Bahrein. There is, however, the possibility that H.A. Government may consider it desirable to suggest to the Sheikh that it might be a good thing to give the remainder of Bahrein to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Once the Bahrein Petroleum Company gets the whole area it will probably increase the diffi culty of any arrangement being come to between the Standard of California and the other big groups (which really means the Iraq Petroleum Company) over this territory with the object of securing a measure of British control# I appreciate the difficulty and in view of the issues involved it might be as well if we were to have an inter/yvl 3. inter-departmental discussion on the whole matter.

It must be remembered, however, that the oil groups' activities in this direction are dictated largely by a proper recognition oi tne possibility of the exhaustion of existing resources in due course, a possibility which was emphasised this week in Sir John Cadman's paper at the opening session of the World Power Conference in New \ork. vVitliout expressing any opinion as to their accuracy, bir John mentioned that recent estimates in various technical publications suggested that the world's oil supply would last only another 20 years. The risk ot an early scarci y of oil may be not quite so serious as these estimates imply, but there can be no questioning the importance, both from the consumers' and the industry s own stan 1 - point, of the exploration of new areas of production and the conservation of existing oil supplies.&lt;*?: ■ In the period covered by these movements, the economic causes underlying profit fluctuations have been plain for all to read. In this way a growing accumulation of savings has been forced into a few sections of a market which have not been large enough to accommodate them. It has been impossible for investment funds to find an outlet in foreign lending ; and the Wall Street experience of 1929 survives as a memory to discourage investment in existing markets abroad. In this way prices have risen ; and, with long-term interest rates still only slightly below 3 per cent., many industrial shares have been forced to a still lower yield basis and in the favoured groups it is only rarely that 4 per cent, yields can be found. Unfortunately there are several factors which in present circumstances tend to encourage a growth of speculation rather thanin vestment. In the first i nstance, there can be no doubt regarding the accumulation of funds which await investment opportunities with growing impatience. This fact renders it virtually certain that, in the absence of specifically unfavourable events at home or abroad, markets will before long resume their upward trend. On the other hand, though industrial profits will doubtless rise in many sections, there is nc economic argument by which the size of the prospective advance in one company's earnings can be forecast at being greater or less than another's. This condition frankly recognised by the majority of investmen advisers, leads to investors ' buying blind.' Unhappily, again, this somewhat promiscuous polic&gt; may well prove right in many instances. A large proportion of the buying in recent months has resulted in shares being taken up and removed for the time being from the market. In a market, therefore, which is ill-supplied with stock a relatively small demand may well lead to a disproportionate rise in prices. In this way blind speculation has a good chance of showing, for a time, excellent results. Combined with this is the fact that the investment public is increasingly profit-conscious. The income obtainable on investment has grown progressively lower as prices have risen ; there has been no parallel fall in the cost of living; speculators are known to have been enriched by rapid profits. The investing public is, therefore, scarcely to be blamed if it tends, to a growing extent, to expect profits rather than income. This is a condition fundamentally unhealthy. In the first instance, the world is too full of political and economic dangers for the possibility of disastrous upheavals to be overlooked. And, sound as may be the industrial progress of the country, the unavoidable foreign dangers are very definite. Secondly, a specu lative market opens the door to speculative issues, which may well elude the vigilance of the Stock Exchange Committee, and which may well be run (as was the case in 1929) to a point which impels catastrophe and which forces banks and brokers to curtail the lending upon r AU OHVUIU, UVTTCVCl, UC CV1U.CJJ.U L UttL WltU tt gVJUJ ICOCJ. V that is bound to be further depleted by the inevitable check to Spanish export trade and by the purchases of war material that are being made despite the embargo, the Spanish authorities—whoever they may be—will, when the time for restabilisation comes, have to beware of the danger of stabilising at too high an exchange value.

The proposal now being considered looks to the organ ization of a new company which will be jointly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and The Texas Corporation, and will take over the present holdings and operations of both parent organiza tions in the entire area east of Suez. In that part of the world Standard of California, as is well known, within the past few years has developed important production in the Bahrein Islands, located in the Persian Gulf, and holds a concession covering another promising field in eastern Saudi Arabia. Through the Netherland Pacific Petroleum Co. (N.V. Neder- landsche Pacific Petroleum Maatschappij) Standard Oil Company of California re cently has been negotiating a concession of approximately 1,500,000 acres in north western Sumatra. The company holds a 20 percent interest also in conjunction with the Royal Dutch-Shell Group and Standard-Vacuum Oil Company in a con cession of the Netherlands New Guinea Petroleum Company (N.V. Nederlandsche Nieuw-Guinee Petroleum Maatschappij) covering 10,000,000 acres in New Guinea. This area is to be reduced to 1,000,000 acres within ten years or earlier when the company has completed its preliminary work. At the present time the New Guinea concession is under survey and its pos sibilities in the way of oil production are quite unknown. The one field in the Near and Far East in which Standard of California has established production is Bahrein where it has twenty-six producing wells. The latest of these (well No. 31) was brought in about the middle of May flowing 26,880 bbl. per day at 2,273 ft. A previous well (well No. 26) was brought in April 29 with 20,400 bbl. per day. These are the largest of the Bahrein wells and indicate that the field exceeds earlier JUNE • 1936 expectations. While production is being held down, the Bahrein Petroleum Com pany during 1935 sold and delivered 1,265,000 bbl. of Bahrein crude and has commitments for shipments of approxi mately 10,000 bbl. daily during 1936. Last year the company started con struction of a refinery at Bahrein which is now nearing completion and which will utilize an additional 10,000 bbl. daily. With this output Bahrein takes its place this year among the important oil produc ing areas of the world. In the past Standard Oil Co. of Cali fornia has not attempted to develop local distribution facilities in Asia or Oceania but has sold oil and products to various other distributors. With the develop ment of a quantity output from its Bah rein properties, however, and the prospect of further increases in production, the question of finding a settled output for this oil and disposing of it without up setting the stability of existing marketing arrangements becomes one of serious mo ment. During the latter part of last year a series of conferences took place between representatives of California Standard and a group representing Royal Dutch- Shell, Jersey Standard and Anglo-Iranian. Discussions at that time concerned joint action by the three latter to take over the holdings of Standard of California in Bahrein or to take the output of Bahrein wells. No agreement was reached and it was subsequently that negotiations were opened between Standard of California and The Texas Corporation. The facilities of the two companies in Asia and Oceania naturally complement each other. While Standard of California has production without established mar keting outlets, Texas Company has dis tributing facilities in practically all parts of the Far East and has long been a sub stantial factor in the trade of that part of the world. The red star emblem of the company is familiar to purchasers of petroleum products in Japan, China, India, Indo-China, the East Indies, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. The products disposed of through stations maintained in these countries had to be drawn from distant sources of supply. Inasmuch as The Texas Company has been regularly a purchaser of crude to meet its distribution requirements, the advantage of having a connection with nearer sources of supply was obvious. It is as an outgrowth of this situation that the proposed combination of interests came into consideration. The projected arrangement is very similar to that followed by Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and Socony-Vac- uum in organizing the Standard-Vacuum Company in which were combined the producing interests of the former and the marketing facilities of the latter. As in that case the union of interests between California Standard and Texas will apply only to operations in the Trans-Pacific and Near Eastern areas and will not affect the activities of either of the parent companies in other parts of the world. In international oil circles the projected organization is looked upon with favor as providing assurance that oil from Bahrein and other potential fields under the con trol of the proposed company will not become an upsetting factor in interna tional markets.

Among these are fourteen countries of the first rank. With a single exception, these are countries that do not produce petroleum or whose petroleum resources are so limited that large yearly importa tions are required. Alcohol can be made in any part of the world from a number of native products, but nowhere, up to the present time, can alcohol suitable for an internal combustion engine be produced at a cost low enough to compete on equal terms with gasoline. State aid or the exercise of state authority is necessary to bring it into general use. Arguments used to support the com pulsory requirement of alcohol-gasoline motor fuel are chiefly three in number. It is contended that by using indigenous products to supply part, at least, of a nation's motor fuel requirements, de pendence upon importations is reduced and the national security in time of war is enhanced.

The na tionalistic argument and the security argument go hand in hand. In the past few years, since many na tions have abandoned their historic monetary standards and exchange diffi culties have multiplied, a second reason for insisting upon including domestically produced alcohol in motor fuel is that it decreases the amount of money or prod ucts that must be sent abroad to pay for imported petroleum or petroleum prod ucts. Since the total tonnage of the alcohol-gasoline mixture required is greater than would be the case with straight gasoline, this advantage is less than ap pears on the surface but it is a considera tion that undoubtedly has carried weight with the governments of certain countries. More weighty than either of the fore going, however, in promoting legislation to make compulsory the use of alcohol in motor fuel has been the desire to help the farmer. In every country where such legislation has been enacted the benefit to agriculture has been the chief claim advanced by its proponents, and this is now the basis of agitation for requiring the use of alcohol in countries like th United States, which have no presen lack of petroleum and where argument based on national security or self-suff ciency do not apply.

Political Agent, Bahrain. iNote of conversation on 3rd August 1936• Present Mr, G.W.R. Smith, Chief -Local Representative Mr. E.A. Skinner, Resident Manager, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. Mr. Skinner announced that the work on the refinery was proceeding more quickly than had been anticipated and that instead of a temporary gauging arrangement being possible until November as had been suggested at our last meeting it now appeared that a whole time gauger would be required within the next five or six weeks. I told the Chief Local representative and the Resident Manager that I had since our last meeting looked up the Company's agreement and found that they were responsible for all gauging and that the Bahrain Government had the right to test gauges. Mr. Skinner told me that he had been in correspondence with Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser on this point and that they had agreed that the present system by which the Bahrain Government does its own gauging for Royalty was the most satisfactory. I read the note of our last meeting which was in the form of an Express Letter to the Honourable the Political Resident and it was agreed to as being correct. I asked when I might expect the written proposal regarding the neutral gauging to pass on to the Bahrain Government and it appeared that in the general rush of work my telephone message to the Chief Local Representative asking for the written proposal had been overlooked by them. Various possibilities were discussed to to meet the situation and the Company favoured the general idea that the Bahrain Government should do all the gauging including the neutral gauging and they should suitably remLinerate the Bahrain Government. It was suggested that either Indian personnel should be engaged or else that an Assistant should be obtained by the Bahrain Government to /help the- 2 - y. help the St^.te Engineer. I told the representatives of the Company that they should put forward a scheme in writing and that I would pass it on to the Bahrain Government and that obvioaol^ c Cose of urgency I would endeavour to get tue Acting Adviser to correspond at once by air mail with iir. Belgrcve with a view to obtaining his views on any proposaj. put forward. I agreed that if the Bahrain Government c.ecxced to engage another Engineer it would probably be possible for Mr. Belgrave to do so while he was on leave. Mr. bkinner informed me that he knew that Mr. Belgrave was in touch with the situation in London and had been in CQiisultation. I pointed out that it was essential that Mr. ^elgx*aV T e be consulted as he was the permanent Adviser and the Bahrain Government would naturally be reluctant and ill advised to commit themselves without reference to him. 2. We then went on to the housing problem and the Manager veiy kindly produced his book showing the expected increase in personnel and a chart showing the housing cccomiuodation being prepared for them. From a rough note made at the time it appears that there are at present and expected the following:- « &lt; i ■ Producing Department Drilling Refinery operation tt tt Constructional work Contractors men 80 25 23 45 130 7 360 * '■ The accommodstion is as follows. Married quarters to accommodate Bachelors quarters to accommodate Bachelors quarters building w Temporary constructions building 50 80 72 192 - 394 /The single-Jo'. - 3 - f t I &lt; i I Tug single men will be two in a quarter and will eventually become one in a quarter as the construction men leave. I clso noteo thet provision was being made for a doctor and hospital with trained nurses. I said I hoped that the new men under- anc j stood the conditions they were coming out to ^the Manager said that he hopea so too and had done everything possible to ensure that they were explained at the time of engagement. i 1 We touched lightly on the subject of the improvement s. to the Manamah/.pier and I told the Manager that personally I was in agreement that something should be done but that the Bahrain Government were considering the matter and that I CiOjj^o c definite statement would be m£de by them soon after the Adviser T s return.'i 'W' ' A rmwi wgnmmwm compaot, umnai b ahrkin I sland , P ersian G ulf, No^A-SSQ^ July 27, 1936. His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, BAHREIN. Dear Sir, Enclosed please find Royalty Tickets Nos. R-l to R-3 and S-l to S—7 • As a temporary expedient, royalty will be paid on the basis of 'Innage*', as opposed to w Outage w . TTnna^e' Method ; Outlet ralTes are locked, a low gauge is taken by the State Engineer, and, when the tank is approrLmately full or oil is required, a high gauge is taken, outlets tmlocked, and inlets locked. 'Outa ge ^ Method ; Inlet valves are locked, and, when a high gauge has been taken, outlet valves unlocked so that the contents may be shipped or used. A low gauge is then taken, and outlets locked, and inlets opened. In both methods 1. Outlet valves release oil to the Refinery or Submarine Loading Line. 2. Inlet valves pemit receipt of oil from the Tifells (Field Gathering System). Thus, until July 1, 1936 royalty was accrued on all oil run out of tanks 80-1, 85-2 and 85-3 to ships, and, since that date, is being accrued on all oil run into tanks 183 and 124 at the refinery, and tanks 80-1, 85-2, and 85-3 at Sitra.It is almost impossible to decide at present upon a permanent method of gauging and we should not attempt to do so until the completion of the addition to the refinery, which includes some 200,000 tons additional tankage of all sizes.

Our letter No. 589 was referred to, which explains that existing conditions t rmVc it necessary to crD&gt; f ethod instead of the 'outage' method.

There is no n™ on n ' ho oould satisfactorily undertake this work. It would be an ua.jarran.ed expense to bring in a European Referee. Sooner or later as the refinery maies more products, there will be more crude run daily'to the refinery and more oifshore shipments, which means that a Bahrein Governnent Inspector will probably have to be on call at all hours o^lhe dayT^sht In our discussion it was suggested: y ^ ^ ni^nt. (1) That the State fingineer should witness the offshore shipments Ticl-etf 1 arlne D ® livery tickets as well as the Royalty (2) That The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited would pay a nominal suii ior each time gauging is witnessed and each time a Run ticket is signed. The amount suggested for this was Rs.13/8. it was pointefoutr 00 ^ 00nTersation ^sterday with to. Skinner also present, -hat tne number of gauges is increasing much wore raoidly than anticipated. ^ (2; That in view of (1) it will only be a short time before a full- time gauger is needed (probably six to eight weeks).-2- (3) That such a ganger need be only a man of average intelligence but that his work should be under the supervision of one who is thoroughly familiar with the whole system of handling oil, such as the present State Engineer. Mr. Skinner pointed out that a special European Referee would be expensive even though he could witness gauges for both the Company and the G-ovemment. He thought it more advisable: (1) To use one or more high-class Indians under the supervision of the State Engineer, or (2) For the Bahrein Government to bring in either an assistant to the State Engineer or an independent engineer to take care of the gauging for both parties. (3) For sucS^n^mp^oyee of the Bahrein Government, and for the Bahrein vj -overnment to be reimbursed by the Company according to the number of gauges taken for the Company or according to any arrangement agreed upon by both parties. It was agreed that the matter is urgent and no time should be lost in coming to some agreement and securing the proper personnel. Yours very truly. Gr. f.

Dear Sir: In line with the general policy of keeping you advised of new work - construction etc., you will probably be pleased to hear that our Company has decided to build a fair sized hospital near the present permanent main camp. The size of the hospital and the personnel have not yet been definitely decided but these details, together with plans, are being worked out by our Head Office. It is planned to complete the hospital at the earliest possible moment but no date can be given at this time.

Dear Sir, jSnclosed please find Royalty Tickets Nos, R.5, R.6-A, R.6-B, S.8, S.9-A, S # 10-A and S.10-B. You will observe that three of the tickets are split into 'A* 1 and 'B' portions, and that the amount of oil upon which royalty is payable on each of these three particular runs is the total of the two tickets (A plus B). However, the total amounts appear on the 'B' tickets, before the amounts already accrued on the tickets are deducted. Our reason for 'splitting^ these deliveries is that, in order to obtain an accurate accounting on crude oil produced, we are compelled to fix a time when one month ends, and a new month commences. As you will notice, the time is 3.A.M. on the first day of the Calendar month. As far a® Shaikh Sir Hamad is concerned, this procedure will make no difference at ever to the total amount of royalty payable to the Bahrein Authorities. He will, however, be assured of getting the royalty on all oil delivered to the Refinery and Sitra tanks during the period in which it was physically pumped into those tanks, without waiting until an official high gauge is taken - sometimes several days after the close of an accounting, or royalty, period.

J ¥ lA* ',5382/36 INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 14th August 1936. D ear 11 r .B a, 11 ant e , As you know, His Majesty's 3overnment have always been particularly anxious that, in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII of the Bahrein Petroleum Companys lease, the maximum possible number of British Subjects should be employed by the Company in Bahrein. The periodic returns submitted by the Company are kept under scrutiny, and it was noted with satisfaction that the proportion of employees in Class I Improved, between January j.934 and Cctober 1935, from Americans 20 - British 8 to Americans 21 - British 15. Thus although the majority of Class I posts were still held by American citizens, the proportion of British Subjects appeared to be gradually increasing, and the position was therefore not too unsatisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. Since then the construction of the Refinery has of coarse resulted in the temporary employment of about an equal number (according to the statement of 1st April 1936) of/ H.R.Ballantyne, Esq., 11, Birchln Lane, E.G.3.of Americans and British in Class I. (49 and 51 respectively). On the other hand, it would appear from the statement of April 1st that in the permanent staff in Class I there has been a considerable swing in the direction of American preponderance. The proportion appears to be Americans 47 - British 25 (with practically all the senior posts held by Americans). This state of affairs has caused sane uneasiness and we feel justified in drawing the attention of the company to the position which has developed. We venture to hope that it may be possible to give some reassurance on the subject. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M. J, CLAUSON^1 20. I .e. Chief ^ocal Representative's w o:PA-S16 of 7-12-1936. P./..
