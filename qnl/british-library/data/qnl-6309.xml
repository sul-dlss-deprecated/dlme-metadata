To Highcoma, Baghdad. No. 175-C. Dated 16th October 1921. Your telegram No.2206 of 16th September. I have received a reply from Ibn Sa’ud dated 6th October to the effect that there is no reason for mediation , because, as you are aware, the country is a part of his Najd dominions. The place belongs to Ibn Mut'ab who has come in to him and not to Ibn Talal at all whose ill fieeds have raised the indignation of everyone. Ibn Talal and his evil fol lowers are now besieged and entirely cut off and all the Bedouins and settled people of Jabal Shammar are under Ibn Sa’ud’s rule. Ibn Sa’ud is personally present to prevent the Ikhwan from attacking Hail because he dislikes bloodshed and because ^ all the people of Hail want him and he will take it by degrees. Ibn Talal has sued for peace but He has refused his request and is insisting on his personal surrender. Secondly. Regarding the Shammar refugees they are his subjects as the Jabal Shammar belonged to his fathers . Last spring they surrendered to him and asked for pardon and paid him zakat ; but in the summer they returned to their evil ways and took refuge in ’Iraq, whence they have raided his subjects wholesale. For them to raid ^ goods and kill jb* people and then for rhe ’Iraq. Government to shelter £&amp; them is likely to break the bonds of friend- fftetK ship between -***, unless the guilty be punished to which ever of the two parties he belong^, and be made to return his loot. For the Shammar who are south of the Euphrates to take refuge in friends’ country when they are guilty subjects would be a shame. It is what he has feared and warned you against in his letters repeatedly, it is impossible for things to go right until these troubles be removed, especially with the ’Iraq. Government. He knowsthe British Government’s intentions towards him and asks you to approach ’Iraq. Government and get these troubles removed. Begarding loot in possession of Shammar who have crossed the Euphrates he asks three things from you and i the ’Iraq. Government (f.) restitution of looted property, (2) punishment of the guilty and (3) guarantees for the future. Regarding the Shammar south ofi the Euphrates he can punish them when and where he likes hut he asks you to have ’Iraq people warned not to mix with them as it would he difficult to distinguish them and he cannot leave them alone. This is his reply to you - King Faisal ia a dear brother hut they have not been in communication till, now. Letter follows by post.t;o. 177-C. Political Agency, Kuwait. 17th. October 1921.

In quoting the gist of my letter he says that 'no reply was being sent to him (ibn Talal) ponding my reply as to whether I would be prepared to accept the mediation of King Kaisal and Kis iixcellency'.

Political Agent, Kuwait.Translation of a letter dated the 3rd Gafar 1340 (6th October 1921) from Ibn Sa'ud to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After compliments. I have received your letter in which you comuunioate to me K.E. the High Commissioner's escape of the 13th Muharram 1340 (16th Geptemher 1921) to the effect that both King Faisal and His Excellency liad received separate* i rom .luhaunad bin Talal ar» Rashid letters appealing for their mediation with a view to terminating the present hostilities between him and me, and that no reply was being sent to him pending my reply as to whether I would be prepared to accept the mediation of King Kaisal and liis j-xce-lency is I ritish representative. Yes, regarding Ibn Talal's appeal I would accept i is Excellency’s medi ation, but thanks be to (k&gt;d there is no need for it, for, as you are aware, this country is a part of my Najd domi nions - left for a long time in the belief that they were worthy. In spite of that, however, they multiplied their ill deeds towards their fellow countrymen and neighbours, till everyone complains of the harm they have done in both religious and worldly matters, and even the A1 Rashid family itself complains of the bloodshed, murder and robbery that they have done. This man whom we are talking about too has nothing to do with the rule of the country which belongs to Ibn LluVib, who has come in to me. Eor them to remain would do great harm to my country and my subjects, and, even if I wanted to let them - or any one of them - remain, the people of :?ajd would not agree xjvil followers are entirely cut off. All the people of hands and under my rule • I am here in person in order to prevent the Ikhwan from marching against the . attacking Y because of the above harm which they have done. Besides, \ they are besieged and helpless now and Ibn Talal and his Jabal Shammar, both nomadic and settled, are now in myHail, and that for two reasons: firstly 'because I do not like 'bloodshed, ,and secondly 'because I know that all the people of Kail want me to rule them as they are weak, and so I am taking them 'by degrees. Ihn Talal has sued for peace, 'but I have refused as I mean to take him, and 'by the gr.ee of God hi a problem v/ill soon be solved. secondly, you say that the ’Iraq. G-overmient is being placed in great difficulty by the influx of Ghammar refu gees, and that it is difficult for them to keep them out although they do not want them, and that they are doing ^ their utmost to induce them to join the t^hammar Jarbah in northern Ja^irah; that in two or three cases they have made •Iraq a rallying point for their raids into the southern desert, possibly against my tribes; but that I am to rest assured that tne ’Iraq Government is doing every tiling ffl/tfX) possible to prevent this, though it is dltficult to prevent it entirely until they get them north of the Euphrates. As regards the Shammar, you know that they are my subjects from of old as the Jabal belonged to my fathers and grandfathers, nast spring they surrendered to me and asked for my forgiveness, and I treated them with honour and they paid me their gsajfcah * But when the summer cane they reverted to their evil ways, and took refuge in ’Iraq and made countless raids and forays against my subjects. You say that you are preventing them from doing this until they cross to the north of the Euphrates and that, once they do cross, you will be able to do so efficiently, r.y answer to this is two-fold:- firstly, for them to kill and rob my property and then for the*Iraq Government to jfyt give them shelter is a thing most calculated to break the bonds of friendship between two parties, unless the guilty, to wnich ever party they belong, be punished and made to disgorge their spoil so that the friends may bo happy and the guilty brought to subjection. Then as regards the Bhammar who are still on the south side of the Euphrates, how can they take refuge in the country of my friends when they have donewrong to me and are my recognised subjects? This would be the greatest of injuries; it is the sort of thing I have feared and warned H«JU the High o-^ilsoioner about repeatedly in my letters. It is impossible for things to go right until the people be at rest and these troubles be over - particularly between me find the Iraq Government* The British Government’s purpose end intentions towards me I know f I am ready and able both in word and deed to rule my subjects and country and keep them from ham,but I request that H«B» the High Commissioner will approach the ’Iraq Government with a view to the removal of these things which mar our happiness. He knows from my letters from first to last tat I desire the peace and confidence of all. Regarding the property plundered from my subjects which is in the possession of the Shammar who have orossec the Euphrates, I ask three things from the High Commis- sioaer and the ’Iraq Government: (1) the restitution of the plunder, (2) their punishment for their boldness, and (3) guarantees for the future. As regards the Ghammar south of the Euphrates X am able to punish them for their deeds when and where I please, but I ask you to warn your friends of the people of ’Iraq not to mix with then, as it would be difficult to distinguish between thei; and as they are guilty I cannot leave them alone. This my reply is for H.B. the High Commissioner - King Kaiaal is a dear brother, nut we have not communicate till now - and I request the High Commissioner to look into these matters and put an end to these troubles.

Begins:- Your Highness’ reply regarding the attack perpetrated by Faisal ad-Dawish and the Ikhwan with him against the 1 Iraq tribes at Abu Ghar has been telegraphed to me by the Political Agent at Bahrain. The conciliatory and statesmanlike tone of it is what I confident ly expected and is appreciated by the ’Iraq Government and myself. Unfortunately, owing to the districts involved, it takes time for Your Highness* effective orders to reach those bodies of your adherents who seek to pursue their hostile raids into 1 Iraq ter ritory, and, though my reports indicate that Faisal ad-Bawish and his contingent have retired to Artawiyah, another raid has taken place further west, a few miles from the Euphrates south of Samawah. The assailants in this case, who are alleged to be the party with Ibn Nuhaiyir, attacked sections of 'Iraq tribes without the slightest provocation, and caused considerable loss of life and property. Ishali address Your Highness further if necessary if it is confirmed that Ibn Nuhaiyir was the aggreosof. In the urgent circumstances existing, I am authorized by His Majesty's Government to intimate to Your Highness and the 'Iraq Government that, pending a settlement of the frontiers between 'Iraq and Najd by means of discussion between representatives of the parties and the conclusion of a treaty in confirmation thereof) it is essential in the Interest of peace that a temporary and provisional frontier should be laid down without prejudice to the subsequent negotiations,so that the tribes of the two parties may be informed of it, and understand what their position is. I am to announce that ^ the following is the frontier line to be observed between the two territories;- It will start fro Kharjah on the Batin, about forty miles north-east of Hafar. From thence it will rfm due west, leaving Hafar* n&gt; t i p &gt; Hafar to you and Dulaimichah and Muqubah to ’Iraq. Thence it will proceed north-west towards the Djal al-Battan leaving Am al-Radhuma and Zabala to Jou and Jumaimah to * Iraq.The frontier will then touch the Djal al-Battan at a point immediately south of Jabal Athamin. Prom thence it win proceed due west between Lifiyah and Loqa and thence through Ai Shir south of Lifiyah,by Feejan, Albuwaitha Khasm al-Ra an Quraiyit al-Dhumran to Mughaiyir, and thence in a direct line towards Sakaka. As regards the Hazal wells, it is douotless wen known to Your Highness that they were formerly regarded as belonging to the Amarat, who dug the well at hoqa, but as in late years these wells have been recognised as appertaining to the Shammar, they are left to you. • Such is the tribal boundary which the two Governments are asked to accept provisionally. In conclusion I respectful ly call upon Your Highness firstly bo recall your representatives Faisal ad-Dawish, Ibn Mu'amir and Ibn Nuhaiyir to your presence and to keep them there for the present, Secondly, to recall to your side of the line all those of your adherents and tribesmen who may now be on this side of it; and thirdly, to warn your subjects that if they cross this provisional frontier pending final issfce of negotiations, they will do so with their own risk. The 1 Iraq Government are being called upon simultaneously to warn their shaikhs in the same sense. Only by this means can peace be maintained. 3nds.

SULTAN OF NEJD’S ASSURANCES. u I Shall Not Fail to Deal With Anybody Found at Fault, and Exert Myself to put a Stop to Further Depredations.’’ Using aware that ttieve is a good deal of uncertainty in the public mind as to the portent of the recent raid by Akhwan on 'Iraq tribes, and the state of relations of the British and 'Iraq Governments with His High ness Ibn Sand, Sultan of Nejd, the High Commissioner sees fit, with the concurrence of His Majesty King Faisal, to publish the following corres pondence for the information of those whom it may interest. From 11. E. the High Commissioner to II. M. King Faisul. The Re«idency, Baghdad, 30th March 1922. Your Majesty, I feel that it is most important at the present juncture that Your Majesty and the ‘Iraq Government should be fully informe I in regard to the communications which have passed between H. H. Saltan Ibn Sa’nd and myself on tbe subject of the recent raid of Faisal Ibn Dawish and kis force of Akhwan on ‘Iraq tribes. As you are aware for several weeks past correspondence has been in progress between myself and Ibn Sa’ud with a view to the fram ing of a Treaty between ‘Iraq and Nejd by which the contiguous frontier of the two States will be defined, and friendly relations placed on a firm rooting. These negotiations were proceeding on a correct and a friendly basis when the recent unfortunate incident took place. I now attach for Your Majesty’s information a copy or a telegiam which I despatched to H. H. Saltan Iba Sa’ud on the 15th March and his reply which reached me last evening, as regards my telegram I trust the terms of it wid commend itself to y^u and your Government. As regards Ibn Sa’ud’s reply, I feel confident that Your Majesty and your Government will appreciate the friendly tone of it, and be gratified to know that the excesses of Faisal al Dawish were per petrated on the latter’s own initiative and contrary to the wishes of his master, and that the latter, namely, H. H. Sultan Ibn Sa’od, is most anxious to p^edorve his friendly relations with this Government. I have also the pleasure to inform you that the Nej 1 representatives deputed to discuss the preliminaries of the Treaty and the frontier with the representatives of this Government are now at Bahrein, and have been directed to come, on to the rendeavous at Muhammerah. Meanwhile I have asked and received authority from London to announce as a temporary measure, pending conclusions of an ‘Iraq NejJ Treaty, that a line of watering places 'shoald be considered the frontie’- between the tribes of ‘Iraq and those of Nejd, and that if Dither side cross that line they will be liable to be attacked. The precise line is now under discussion and I shall keep you informed of the result arrived at. I am, Your Majesty’s sincere friend, - p 7 Dawish’s intrusion into ‘Iraq territory and aitack on Iraq tribes was undertaken with your knowledge or approval, and I urge you to inform me at once that I am justified in my belief and that you will punish them for their misdeeds and return the livestock looted from the Ziiyad and other Iraq tribes and compensate them for men killed. In any case I fear the incident shows that Fais-il Dawish and his men are not under your effective control and it will, I fear, make a very grave and unfavourable impression on His Majesty’s Government. 2. Telegram from His Highness the Sultan of Nejd to His Excellency the High Commissioner. I have received your telegram relative to Faisal Dawish. The matter appears to be as you say though I had no knowledge previous to your telegram, and can scarcely credit the news. Before tney went out I sent word to them at Dakaij to return and they went back to near Hafar which is the last I heard of them, i Matter has affected me even more than you. ' I am displeased and did not expect it. Cannot j think Akhwan attacked without reason, but ! cannot reply till get particulars. Nevertheless i I am ex remely sorry. I thank you for not allowing yourself to have any suspicions of your friend’s good itnent. It is not possible that they are out of my control, and I beg you not to imag rift -hie. Is has arisen from some mis understanding as will occur with Bedouins. Rest assured that I shall not fail to deal with anybody . found at fault, and exert myself to put a stop to ! further depredations. From II. M. King Faisal to H. E. the High Commissioner, The Boyal Court, Baghdad, 1-4-22. Dear Sir Percy, I am in receipt or your letter of the 3(hh March 1922, enclosing correspondence exchanged with H. H. the Saltan of Nejd, with regard to the recent raid by Faisal al Dawish, commander of the forces of H. H. the Sultan, against ‘Iraq tribes. I cannot but render Your Excellency great thanks for the interest you have taken in the matter, and for your continuous efforts iu this direcdon.

Text of Correspondence Between lb Sand, Sir Percy Cox, and King Faisul. SULTAN OF NEJD’S ASSURANCES. “I Shall Not Fail to Deal With Anybody Found at Fault, and Exert Myself to put a Stop to Further Depredations.’’ Being aware that there is a good deal of uncertainty in the public mind as to the portent of the recent raid by Akhwan on ‘Iraq tribes, and the state of relations of the British andi ‘Iraq Governments ivith Ilis High ness Ibn Saud, Sultan of Nejd, the High Commissioner sees fit, with the concurrence of His Majesty King Faisal, to publish the following corres pondence for the information of those ichom it may interest. From H. E. the High Commissioner to H. M. King Faisul. The Re«idency, Baghdad, 30th March 1922. Your Majesty, I feel that it is most important at the present juncture that Your Majesty and the ‘Iraq Gbvemment should be fully informe 1 in regard to the coinmumcations which have passed between H. H. Sultan Ibn Sa ud and myself on the subject of the recent raid of Faisal Ibn Diwish and his force of Akhwan on ‘Iraq tribes. As you are aware for several weeks past correspondence has been in progress between myself and Ibn Sa’ud with a view to the fram ing of a Treaty between ‘Iraq and Nejd by which the contiguous frontier of the two States will be defined, and friendly relations placed on a firm tooting. These negotiations were proceeding on a correct and a friendly basis when the recent unfortunate incident took place. I now attach for Your Majesty’s information a copy of a telegiam which I despatched to H. H. Saltan Ibn Sa’ud on the 15th March and his reply which reached me last evening. AS regards my telegram I trust the terms of it wid commend itself to you and you;- Government. As regards Ibn Sa’ud’s reply, I feel cmfidetit that Your Majesty and your Government will appreciate the friendly tone of it, and be gratified to know that the excesses of Faisal al Dawish were per petrated on the latter’s own initiative and contrary to the wishes of his master, and that the latter, namely, H. H. Sultan Ibn Sa’ud, is most anxious to pteserve his friendly relations with this Government. I have also the pleasure to inform you that the Nej 1 representatives deputed to discuss the preliminaries of the Treaty and the frontier with the representatives of this Government are now at Bahrein, and have been directed to common to the rendezvous at Muhammerah. Meanwhile I have asked and received authority from London to announce as a temporary measure, pending conclusions of an ‘Iraq Nejd Treaty, that a line of watering places should be considered the frontier between the tribes of ‘Iraq and those of Nejd, and that if oither side cross that line they will be liable to be attacked. The precise line is now under discussion and I shall keep you informed of the result arrived at. I am, Your Majesty’s sincere friend, P. Z COX. 1. Telegram from His Excellency the High Commissioner to His Highness the Sultan of Nejd. A little more than a year ago I had occasion to protest to Your Highness in regard to the hostile activities of your adherent Faisal D^wish and the force of Akhwan accompanying him who were then threatening Z ibeir. Tuey only retired under threat of bombardment. The same thing has happened this season. For some weeks past the south frontier of ‘Iraq has been continually disturbed by constant threats of Akhwan raids against ‘Iraq tribes. On 7-.h March I telegraphed to Your Highness via Bahrein urging you to control him and to put a slop to his mischievous activities, your approval of which could not be believed in view ot the negotiations which were current between ns. I have now to inform you that on 11th March a large force of Akhwan numbering between two thousand and three thousand ! uader the leader ship of Faisal Dawish, Dhaydan-al Hithlaiu^ Salman Mandil, Kuallof al Jaid and others attacked the ‘Iraq tribesmen grazing round the wells of Abo Ghar and after killing a large number and capturing quantities of camels and livestock, advanced on Shaqrah and attacked the ‘Iraq Camel Police who were camped there at the time. All this appears to have been entirely without provocation. On hearing the above news aeroplanes were sent to reconnoitre and to keep me informed of the movements of the Akhwan. They held specific orders not to attack without further reference to me unless they were gratuitously attacked by the Akhwan. On 14th instant they located the Akhwan near the lake of Abulia and were received by them with heavy rifle fire. They accordingly had no alternative but to retaliate and punish the Akhwan which they did. Now, although it is reported to me that Your Highness had been sending supplies to Haffar for Ibn Dawish’s force, I cannot believe, in view of the friendly corres pondence in progress between us, that ibn Dawish’s intrusion into ‘Iraq territory and attack on‘Iraq tribes was undertaken with your knowledge or approval, and I urge you to inform me at once that I am justified in my belief and that you will punish them for their misdeeds and return the li vestock looted from the Ziiyad and other ‘Iraq tribes and compensate them for men killed. In any case I fear the incident shows that Faisal Dawish and his men are not under your effective control and it will, I fear, make a very grave and unfavourable impression on His Majesty’s Government. 2. Telegram from His Highness the Sultan of Nejd to His Excellency the High Commissioner. I have received your telegram relative to Faisal Dawish. The matter appears to be as you say though I had no knowledge previous to your telegram, and can scarcely credit the news. Before tney went out I sent word to them at Dakaij to return and they went back to near Hafar which is the last I heard of them. Matter has affected me even more than you. I am displeased and did not expect it. Cannot think Akhwan attacked without reason, but cannot reply tili get particulars. Nevertheless I am ex remely sorry. I thank you for not allowing yourself to have any suspicions of your friend’s good iuient. It is not possible that they are out of my control, and I beg you not to imag ne this. It has arisen from some mis understanding as will occur with Bidouins. Rest assured that I shall not fail to deal with anybody found at fault, and exert myself to put a stop to further depredations. From H. M. King Faisal to H. E. the High Commissioner, The Royal Court, Baghdad, 1-4-22. Dear Sir Percy, I am in receipt or your letter of the 30th March 1922, enclosing correspondence exchanged with H. H. the Saltan of Nejd, with regard to the recent raid by Faisal al Dawish, commander of the forces of H. H. the Sultan, against ‘Iraq tribes. I cannot but render Your Excellency great thanks for the interest you have taken in the matter, and for your continuous efforts in this direction. There is no doubt that the explicit terms of your telegram, indicating clearly your desire to settle the dispute, and to establish peace and friendship between ‘Iraq and Nejd on a firm basis, will be received with satisfaction and gratification by the Government and people of ‘Iraq. The reply of Ibn Sa’ud is also indicative of H. H.’s good intention. I am sure that, after these declarations, H. H. the Sultan will give evidence of his genuine desire for the retention of friendly relations with us and will punish the aggressors among his followers, and those of them who were responsible for this painted incident. l am also confident that he will, meanwhile, undertake to make the necessary compensation— s indie ited in your telegram to him—to the tribes who were attacked unawares in their ordinary habitat without any reasonable grounds and that he will recall his representative, Abdul Rahman Ibn Mu’amir, who continues in the name of the Sultan to threaten the tribes and extort taxation from them, and finally that be will have refunded to those concerned ail s«,me thus obtained from them by Abdul Rahman under whatever decep tion they might have been levied. I hardly need confirm to Your Excellency my repeated declarations, that my firmest desire is to have relations between ‘Iraq and Nejd established on a basts of genuine friendship and complete and i neutral amity. I am prepared, after cmsultation with my Gove rnment, to accept the line suggested by Your Excellency as a temporary frontier to separate Nejd and ‘Iraq tribes pending a final fixation of the frontiers of the two States* In this connection, I would like to invite Your Excel lency’s attention to the fact that the presence of Ibn Mu’amir within ‘Iraq territory will be a cause for the continuance of misunderstanding and will prevent the tribes from regaining a sense of peace and tranquillity. I, therefore, have no doubt that Your Excellency will concur in the desirability of issuing direct instructions to him to leave ‘Iraq territory immediately after the fixation of the line which it is intended to fix as a temporary frontier between 'Iraq and Nejd tribes. If we hold up this question of Ibn Ma’amir pend ing receipt of reply from Ibn Sa’ud—a matter which will cause no little delay owing to the long distances—his continued stay among ‘Iraq tribes will lead to further misunderstanding. In all events I trust that the arrival at Bahrein of the Nejd representatives will prove to be a healthful preliminary step towards the resumption of friendly intercourse and the cementing of relations of alliance between the two neighbouring countries.

I have telegraphed the purport of your letter to my Government and to His Majesty’s representative at Cairo,. With regard to the appointment of an agent to repre-» sent your interests at Damascus, I fully agree that you should discuss the matter with the Agaili merchants from Syria before finally selecting a man for the post, and that in the meantime His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus should accord his good offices to your subjects in Syria. I am telegraphing to His Majesty’s Consul accordingly. I shall he glad to receive particulars of the man whom you eventually select as your representative so that I can recommend him to my Govt. In the mean time however I learn from His Majesty’s Consul Damascus that Mohammad al ’Asaimi continues to pose as your representative there and that your subjects continue to apply to him for assistance. You have seen for yourselfI how ’Asaimi’s intrigues have produced false and harmful rumours that his activities in your name should he stopped before he does further injury to your interests. I suggest therefore that you should not delay to inform your subjects in Syria that ’Asaimi has no authority to act on your behalf and that they should apply when necessary, direct to His Majesty*s Consul for his good offices. I would further suggest that you should write a letter in the same sense to His Majesty’s Consul Damascus making it clear that you donot recognise ’Asaimi as your representative in any way and asking him to deal with your subjects direct until you acppaioi appoint a duly accredited representative. those who wish^impair the friendly relations existing between Your Highness and His Majesty’s Government will be defeated. regarding your relations with the French and I strongly advise By such means as these I am confident that the efforts of Sd/- P.2.Cox HIGH OOMMISSIOMEB.Telegram (P).

Jauf as i had not consider© d it a question which would Interest His Majesty's Government in view of the fact that it has never had had any connection with the ’I'urkiah Government or with Arab Governments. Formerly it was for years part of ay ancestors' dominions; t hen, when their power waned, it passed to Ibn Rashid, in whose hands it remained until I took Hail. During the siege I told Ibn Sha'lan to occupy It, and when Hall fell he acknowledged In writing that he &amp; his followers, the Ruwalah, were my subjects, and that Jauf was legally odm mine. I appointed him governor on condition that he would enter into no political relations with anyArab GovernmenL. When I saw, however, that he was not abiding by this agreement, but was entering Into f politics witH Western Powers and Arab Governments, I ordered him i * to leave and sent 'Aaaf al-Mansur to relieve him. 'Asaf was wel comed by the Inhabitants and was given an official reception bythe deposed governor and there was no fighting of any son.. The people of Jauf are all Najdis, and their religion and customs are the same. I regret the attack near Aaraq as I have always told my subjects to respect the place and its Inhabitants. Regarding TransJordania. Had communication between us been easier I would have told you my grievances against the tribes living between it and me, even though I did not think it of any Importance to you, as Ibn Rashid used to collect zakat from this piece of desert and they are all my subjects as has been acknowledged In I writing by ’Audah Abu Tayah, Shaikh of the Huwait&amp;t, and others. Still, I do not believe any of my subjects would go to the villages in question without provocation. I learn from Hail that recently there have been several raids by the Banl Sakhr and Huwaltat a^lnat the Shaamar, ’Anlaah, Hutalm and Harb In the neighbourhood of the« of the Jabal, and doubtless they have retaliated. I did not order any such raids, nor did I forbid them, X as I never thought His Majesty's Government would interfere in the case of tribes former^ subject to Ibn Rashid. Still, I am willing to prevent any action on the part of my subjects provided His Majesty's Government will guarantee the return of the loot to the tribes in question, and will control the others. I am issuing orders forbidding any aggres sion against the Government of TransJordania and its settlements, but I want your opinion regarding the desert. This is one of the important questions which I am so anxious to see you about as soon possible. Ends. Letter follows by post.i Telegraai (P).

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram through the Political Agent, Kuwait, in which you convey to me your relief atfte termination of the HaJJ and the appreciation of the Secretary of State for the Colonies,for which I am very grateful. I have already told you all that is necessary about this question. I am very much surprised at what you say about Jauf, as X had not considered it a question in which His Majesty's Government would be interested, seeing that it has no connections to call for reference or discussion, but has always been entirely separate from the -^rab Governments and also from the Turkish Government and the territories under her sway. In point of fact Jauf is a district which in the past unquestionably belonged to my ancestors, the A1 ba'ud, for many years; then, when their power waned, the Rashid amirs of Hail took possession of it, and it remained under their effective control until I occupied Hail. When I was besieging Hail I instructed Ibn Sha'lan to proceed to Jauf and protect the neigh bourhood. After I had occupied Hail Ibn Sha’lan came to me and drew up a written agreement with me, which I can show you whenever you like, in which he stated that he and the Ruwalah under him were my subjects, and definitely acknowledged that the district of Jauf was , V legally mine, as it was my ancestors before me. I appointed him governor of- the place on certain conditions which were laid down In the agreement, namely that he would not enter into politic^,! rela tions with any Arab or other Eastern, Government. When, however, I saw that he was not abiding by this agreement, but was entering into political relations with Western Powers and Arab Governments, I sent a letter to Sultan ash-Sha'lan ordering him to leave forth with, and instructed one of my followers, 'Assaf al-ilansur,* to proceed there with a hundred men and take over governorship. The latter entered Jauf with the acclamations of the people and was officially welcomed by the deposed governor, and letters from Sultan ash-Sha'lan, written after he had handed over to 'Assaf ) show that he fjiult® satisfied There way no fighting of any sort. 1 do riotI do not, to-day, see any difference as regards sovereignty and possession between the district of Jauf and my capital, Riyadh, as both are part of one indivisable country, for, as you are aware, Jauf con sists of Najd villages inhabited by Najdis to whom we are bound by ties of custom, religion and race* It had no administrative or political connection with the former wilay&amp;ts of 'Iraq, or with that of Syria, or with the mutasarrifiyah of Jerusalem, which is now the Government of &amp;ajQuuiia9i Palestine and the Government of Transjordani* Moreover,It was an actual possession of my forefathers’, and then of Ibn Rashid's, to all of whose possessions and territories I have now succeeded. You refer to attacks mad® by my subjects in the neighbourhood of the Government of TransJordania, and also near the posts of Azraq Regarding Ajtraq, I regret that any incident should have taken place near this post us I am always warning my subjects and tribes to respect the place and its Inhabitants, and to give every assis- cfrose tance in their power^from it with whom they come in contact. Regarding TransJordania. Had my facilities for communicating with His Majesty's Government been as good as those of Trunejordania^ I would have troubled you with my grievanves against the tribes living between it and myself, and would have related all the inci dents which have happened since spring. The great distance, however, and my indifferent means of communicating with His Majesty's Govern ment have prevented me from relating my grievances, and this is detrimental to my rights. I did not think you would be interested in these incidents, as these desert tribes were under Ibn Rashid's control, and he a levied taxes and aakah from them, and they are now my subjects, as has been acknowledged in writing by 'Audah Abu Tayah Shaikh of the Huwaitat, and others. At the same time I do not think i / , any of my subjects would have Interfered with the villages in ques tion if mischief-making people from them had not first gone against them, as I learn from my governor of Hall that the Banl Sakhr and Huwaitat have recently made many attacks on the Shammar, 'Aniaah, Hutalm and Harb in the neighbourhood of the Jabal, and naturally these raids lead to reprisals. I have not ordered any such reprisals ft* | M nor have I forbidden them, as I never thought His Majesty s Govern-Hia Majesty 5 o Sovenuaent — would Interfere in the case of tribes formerly subject to Xbn Rashid, as stated above. Still, I am ready to prevent any action being taken by my subjects - other than those who are absconders and not under my control - provided His Majesty E s Government will guarantee the restitution to my subjects, the Shammar, ‘Anizah, Hut&amp;im and Harb, of their losses and the stolen property with the people under reference, and will undertake to keep them in order. Xour letter reached me on my way to Hasa, and X shall send special messengers to my governor at Hall and instruct him to warn all my subjects and tribes against performing any act of aggression towards the Government of transJordan!a, and I shall write to all the heads of the tribes to respect all inhabited buildings and places, and especially railway arid telegraph buildings. Regarding the desert tribes, however, I shall wait for your opinion. Xn conclusion, I very much regret these unfortunate incidents which worry me from time to time, as they worry my friend and cause afeftgot misunderstandings, and must do so until these questions are finally settled. This is one of many important matters which induce me to ask for an early interview with my friend. Usual ending.Telegram (P). From Political, Kuwait. To Hlghcoma, Baghdad; repeated to Basrah.

He says they are still continuing to raid, particularly Ibn Hallaf and Abu Bhira*, and asks that you will consider the question and take action to stop them and to recover the property looted from his subjects, otherwise he fears It will be difficult to prevent the latter from taking the matter into their own hands much as he would regret their doing so.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 22nd Muharram 1341 (14th September 1922)^, and to thank you for helping me in the matter. Kindly convey to H.E, the High Conmisaloner for ’Iraq that I have already brought to hie notice on several occasions the question of the JUUm thefts and acts of aggression which continue to be perpetrated by certain sections of the Dhafir, such as ohe Samid and the S&amp;'Id - Hallaf and Abu Bhira' - etc. and have asked for his assistance in the matter. I have urged His Excellency to use his influence to stop this thieving and aggression against my subjects, and to punish them in a suitable manner, but I have seen no result to my requests,and that has encouraged them to continue their III deeds and repeated acts of aggression. It would take too long to Asraxife describe each individual theft in detail. I request finally that H.E. the High Commissioner may be so kind as to go into the question, and deal with these wretched people in such a way that they take notice and stop their crimes, and that he recover from them all the live stock which they have plundered from my subjects, so that I may return it to its owners, and that the latter may not cherish thoughts of revenge or take steps to recover It by their own efforts. For them to do so would, of course, be contrary to my wishes, but, even so, it will be difficult to prevent. I therefore beg that His Excel lency will look into the matter and give It due consideration, and I have firm confidence in him.

It passed off, on the whole, very well. I think it is unlikely that Abdulla &gt;il Qasaibi has yet returned to Bahrain as Seyed Has him made a strong point of obtaining permis ion for the man to return # of course, he was careful to add, as a purely private individual. On this understanding I have asked Daly to facilitate his return. Seyed Hashim took five long letters to Bin Sa'ud and I have no doubt that an interminable correspondence will ensue, tempered by the fact that it takes two months for letter and reply between Riyadh and Bushire at the very least. r '9 t kCopy of* a letter dated S4th Tamadi I # 1341 (^IPth January 1923) from Shaikh Sir Abdul ben Abdur Rahman al Faisal as Saud* Soltan of ^ejd and neoendenoies, to the Hon , ble Lieut-Colonsl /•^.irevor, C«S«I» f C*I*K #9 Political Resident in the Persian 'hilf, Rushire.

While it would be most desirable to unify pro cedure as far as possible in regard to Nejdians , it does not appear practicable for the mement to introduce the use of the same certificate of identity or passport in all ‘ parts . at the same time the form of endorsement or countersignature on these papers should be identical in all oases, in order that passport officers and immigration officers in the Near and Middle Nast may be in a position to accept as valid Nejaian passport documents so endorsed ox countersigned by responsible Consular Officers without difficulty or delay. j. 1 am therefore to inform you that the following form of words written both in_ hnglls^ and in xiXabio , on Nejdian nationality papers should be used for the future; ••The seal of the representative of the duitan of Nejd at '^here insert Damascus , Jubail, Cjair , ^atif etc. , et ,/ ••is hereby countersigned by me (insert name of officer, pis Britannic Majesty's Consul at tne good offices of his Britannic Majesty's Consulate at ^ving been extend ed Lieut-Col . *.

The above wording which avoids any promise of assistance has been devised in order that some latitude may be given to British authorities in other places in dealing with jejdian subjects according to their discretion. While it is not desired to include tnese persons within the strict category oi British protected persons , it is equally not desired that any ether ^uro^ean power should assume charge of them when they are travelling outside their own country . 5 .

The Bhalkh of Kuwait has also received a letter from Ibn Sa*ud expressing great regret at the raid in his territory and promising to take the matter up. He asks the Shaikh to promise not to give shelter to fugitives from his tribes. The people of Kuwait put little or no trust in wh*-t Ibn 3a*ud says, and the general opinion is that he will not punish anyone for the recent raid, nor cause restitution to be made. The report referred to in my telegram No. 143-a of 12th Kay 1924 that the Xkhwan force under Fuqua, shaikh of the Sahabah sub-section of the Muwahah section of the 'Ilwah ^utair, had retired to the south, has been eonfinned.Notwlfe - standing this, the wall of Kuwait la still being manned by 150 to 300 men every night.

The sa^ne word ’’Vakil' is used by the Government of India in its kharitas to Indian Princes when referring to Political Agents. Colonel Prideaux suggests that the form to be used might be M al Vakil al Britanniya* leaving out the word ^Biasi” which he thinks unnecessary. This form would approximate closely to the form ’’al Consul al Britanniya' to be used by British Consuls. Colonel Prideaux does not think there is any fear of the word 11 Vakil w leading to confusion with Mespera Agent. But before finally deciding on the point he would be interested to know how the word Political Avent' was translated in the original letter announcing to the Shaikh of Kuwait the creation of the appointment.

I agree that 'Vakil' would give the meaning of Pollttr cal Agent ® though of course it would have to be 'Al-Wakil al-Britanni' not 'Britarmiya' • and my only objection to it is, as X have already stated , that it already has another conventional meaning. I still maintain that anyone asking to be directed to the house of al-Wakil al~Brltannl would be m sent to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation every time and not to the Agency. This, however, is a matter of no moment so far as Kuwait is concerned, as I have only seen two Hajd passports as yet, o$her than speclnen copies on my files.
