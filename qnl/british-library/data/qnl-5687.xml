C N The correspondence on this subject which is now in progress may be taken as having commenced with a Letter from the Government of India, No. 104, dated the 10th June 1870, reporting events which had lately occurred at Berbera. The proceedings of the Egyptian Government, in sending a vessel of war to cruise off Berbera during the season, had led the Resident at Aden to suspect that the Pasha was endeavouring to occupy that and adjoining places on the African coast in the Sultan’s name, and to fear that the Somalis might yield to the influence which was being brought to bear on them, to the sacrifice of their own independence and to the detriment of Aden, which was dependent on Berbera for its supply of live stock. On the 8th March 1870, the Resident sent the “ Sind ” to Berbera to watch the progress of affairs. On board was one Subehdar Mahomed, who had for 20 years been employed in dealing with the Somalis of Berbera and Bulbar. This person landed with his party, his object being by friendly representations to prevent, if possible, the tribes from subjecting their country to Mahometan rule. But the Somalis, either really mistrusting his intentions, or incited by the Egyptians, attacked him, and in the encounter which ensued one Somali was killed, and several persons on either side were seriously wounded. Towards the end of March, Her Majesty’s ship “ Teazer,” visited Berbera. Captain Blomfield found the Egyptian corvette “ Khartoum ” in the port, and the Egyptian colours flying on the fort which commanded the town. To the latter circumstance the Somalis attached no importance, and they showed no signs of surrendering their independence. The Egyptian Commodore declared that the flag was not flying by his authority, though its existence there did not surprise him, “ as the country had formerly belonged to Turkey.” He was not empowered to purchase Berbera or take possession of it, but was merely there to look after Egyptian interests. The Resident next wrote to Mahomed Jemali Pasha, who was on board the “Khartoum,” to inquire what were the intentions of the Sultan in regard to Berbera. In his answer the Pasha, who signed himself “ Commander of the Elect in the Red Sea,” distinctly asserted that the country belonged to the Sublime Porte, and, in support of his statement, cited the fact of the Turkish flag flying over the fort. Hence, he argued, there was no necessity for the Turks to take the country. He himself had merely repaired to the spot to settle quarrels amongst the Somalis. Lord Mayo’s Government, in forwarding the papers relating to these * t -o v.- , xr j j transactions,* expressed an opinion that * * India Political, No. 104, dated i. iv i_ \ r xi m i • i ^ 10th June 1870. establishment ot the Turkish rule over Berbera would be injurious to the interests of Aden. They therefore urged upon the Duke of Argyll the propriety of remonstrating against the proceedings of the Turkish or Egyptian officials, and the necessity for taking such steps as might seem most suitable to secure the independence of the Somali territory. They concluded:—“ Whatever the intentions of the Turkish or Egyptian “ Government may be, we are aware of no adequate ground on which it “ can claim the Somali territory as part of its dominions. We have had “ relations with the Somalis as an independent tribe since 1827, in which 17641. A 42 “ year we concluded a treaty of peace ” (see Appendix A.) cc and friendship “ with them, under the terms of which any vessels bearing the English “ flag may enter and leave any of these ports for the purpose of trade, “ without impediment, injury, or molestation. A similar treaty was “ concluded in 1856, and we have in the meantime intimated to the “ Bombay Government our opinion that the rights and privileges which “ we have secured by these treaties cannot be affected by any arrange- “ ment which the Turkish or Egyptian authorities may make with the “ Somalis.” * From Foreign Office, 28th July 1870. Almost simultaneously with this letter from India came a letter from the Eoreign Office,* forwarding, for any observations which the Duke of Argyll might have to offer, copy of a despatch from Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt on the subject of the above correspondence between the Resident at Aden and Jemali Pasha. The Khedive had mentioned the matter to General Stanton during a con versation ; that Officer had replied that he was unable to offer any opinion on the subject, not knowing how far the territorial right claimed by the Egyptian Government on behalf of the Porte could l&gt;e substan tiated, but that, if furnished with copies of the correspondence that had taken place, he would refer the matter for Lord Granville’s considera tion. A memorandum by Mr. Hertslet on the Turkish claim to sove- reignty over the Somali territory was enclosed in the Eoreign Office letter. Its conclusions may he summarized as follows :— 1. The question had not been previously raised, but, so far as ap peared from the secret papers in the Eoreign Office, the terri tory round Berbera was held by an independent Chief, giving no allegiance to the Porte; there was nothing to show that he paid tribute to the Sultan, or that the Turkish flag was ever seen flying on the coast. 2. The Somali coast extended from the port of Zeyla on the Danakil coast, round Cape Guardafui, to Ras-al-Khyle on the eastern coast of Africa, in 7° N. latitude. 3. “ The Gulf of Aden Pilot,” a work compiled by the Admiralty from memoirs of Officers of the Indian Navy, containing many particulars respecting the coast, says nothing about the Porte having ever exercised any authority over that territory. 4. According to Dr. Beke (in 1862), the Porte occupied the entire African coast, southward of the 21st parallel, within the Red Sea, and also outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, as far as the port of Zeyla, at which place was stationed the last Turkish srarrison. 5. In September 1862, a Chief on the Somali coast had been treated by the British authorities as if lie were entirely independent, satisfaction being exacted for the murder of a boat’s crew at a point 15 miles west of Cape Guardafui, without any question being raised as to the Turkish authorities being in any way con cerned in the matter, which they would have been had their flag floated over any part of the neighbouring coast. 6. The question would appear to be set at rest by the fact that in 1827 and 1856 treaties were concluded on behalf of the Go vernment of India with the Sheikhs of the Habr Owul at Berhera. t To Foreign Office, 5th August 1870. On the 5th August 1870, Mr. Merivale replied to the Eoreign Office,! merely forwarding the papers received from India, stating that the question was under the consideration of the Duke of Argyll, who would express his views more fully on a future occasion, and inviting special attention to para. 13 a of the Aden Resi dent’s letter of the 21st April, which formed an enclosure to the Go-3 vemment of India letter. The paragraph in question was as follows :— “ The only measure I can propose is for the authorities in England pro- “ testing against the Pasha or Viceroy of Egypt taking Eerbera, or “ attempting to take it, under his rule in the name of the Sultan, in- “ sisting that these tribes are independent, that we have a treaty of “ peace and friendship with them, that our intercourse with these “ Somali ports is daily increasing, that thousands of these Somalis reside “ in Aden, and that our traffic with them is considerable, that the tribes c themselves, as will he seen by their sworn statements, consider them- “ selves free, and do not wish to submit themselves to the rule of any “ power. This should, I think, he insisted on; if not, the country “ will, I fear, under Egyptian rule, he reduced to poverty, and our “ traffic stopped or diverted. As I before remarked, our means of “ food, that is, animal food, are almost all received from Berbera/’ The Foreign Office replied* that Lord Granville would await the * ^ „. . Duke of Argyll’s promised communica- 1870 g ' 0ffice ’ 8th Au s ust tion, but that his Lordship would be glad,’when it was made, to have with it some distinct evidence to show that Her Majesty’s Government were entitled to protest, as suggested by the Resident at Aden, against the Viceroy taking Berbera, or seeking to rule it under the name of the Sultan, and for insisting on the independence of the tribes; it might be convenient .to Aden that the Turks should not hold sw T ay in Berbera, but that would scarcely be a sufficient ground for disputing their rioffit to do so. 1 The Duke of Argyll’s “promised communication” w r as, however, not made until more than than three years had elapsed. The Resident at Aden from time to time reported the proceedings of the Egyptians at Berbera, and his letters were sent on to the Foreign Office without com ment. On the 2nd September 1873f he wrote to the Government of Bombay that Her Majesty’s ship “Dalhousie” had found the Egyptian corvette “ Arkha” at Berbera, commanded by Radhw r an Bey, who had offered assistance to the “ Dalhousie,” as if “ the territory belonged to the Egyptians.” General Schneider went on:—“The injury that may follow to our position in Aden from the “ permanent occupation by the Turks or Egyptians of Berbera and “ other ports on the African coast outside the Red Sea have been so “ fully reported on by former Residents that I have nothing to add on “ the subject.” On the 22nd October 1873J, he forwarded a report of a visit made by Captain Hunter, the Assistant Resident, to Berbera, and of his communications with Radhwan Bey. The latter hoped soon to be relieved, but expected troops to the number of 2,000, to remain as a permanent garrison. It was reported that the Somalis were beginning to feel the Egyptian yoke galling, and Captain Hunter considered that, unless troops were stationed at Berbera, the Khedive’s authority would be but nominal, and, in any case, confined to the place itself. He added,—“ The Egyptian flag was, as heretofore, “ flying on the fort, but as the Turkish or Egyptian flag is looked on by “ many Mahomedan wild tribes as the standard of Islam, and not con- “ veying more than an acknowledgment of the religious supremacy “ of the Sultan of Turkey, it docs not seem to determine absolute “ allegiance.” The Government of India drew attention to the Resident’s letters above quoted, in Despatches dated respectively 21st November and 26th December 1873, Nos. 203 and 221. In the earlier Despatch they wrote,— “ It appears to us highly desirable that we should be furnished as soon “ as possible with the views of Her Majesty’s Government on the “ question discussed in our Despatch, No. 104, dated the 10th June f From Aden, No. 52, dated 2nd September 1873. | From Aden, No October 1873. 63, dated 22nd“ 1870, in order that we may be able to issue instructions to the Resident “ at Aden for bis guidance.’ On the 26th November 1873,* the Resident at Aden reported that * Letter from Aden, No. 72, dated the Ayal Yoonus of Bulbar, having 26th November 1973. recently plundered a kafila belonging to the Ayal Ahmed of Berbera, the latter had complained to Radhwan Bey, who informed the offenders that if they did not restore the plunder he would blockade the port of Bulbar. General Schneider brought this to notice, in order to show how Turkish or Egyptian interference with the Somali tribes outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb might affect our position at Aden, by stopping the export of cattle on which Government relied to provision the settlement. The blockade of the Somali ports was a measure wdiich had hitherto only been exercised by the Resident, under the orders of the Government of India. On the 4th December 1873,f the Resident forwarded a report of a . „ . , _ , , ,. visit paid by Her Majesty’s ship December 1873. Quang Tung to Berbera, Zeyla, and Tajourra. The occupation of Berbera by the Egyptians appeared to be complete, and no secret was made of the intention of the Khedive to send a detachment of troops there, as a permanent garrison. “ It rests,” said General Schneider, “ with Her “ Majesty’s Government to decide whether this occupation shall be “ recognized, bearing in mind all that has been written against such a “ proceeding.” On the 6th January 1874, the Resident telegraphed to the Secretary of State that Munzinger Pasha, at Berbera, had invited the Somali Sheikhs to make submission to the Egyptian Government. This tele gram, the Resident’s previous letters, and that from the Government of India of the 21st November 1873, were forwarded to the Foreign Office, + n/r ^ /r». ^ in a letter from Mr. Grant Duff,t dated 17th January 1874. whlcU mTlted Lord Granville s attention to the correspondence of 1870, quoted certain paragraphs containing the views of the Government of India at that time, and concluded as follows:—“The Duke of Argyll is of “ opinion that, having recently taken vigorous measures to protect the “ outlying Chiefs around Aden from any interference on the part of the “ Turks, it would be obviously inexpedient to view with indifference “ similar proceedings on the opposite coast, which are open to similar “ objections as regards our interests at Aden. I am therefore to suggest, “ for Earl Granville’s consideration, the expediency of instructing the “ Consul General in Egypt to represent to the Government of the “ Khedive that Her Majesty’s Government view these proceedings with “ much dissatisfaction, and are anxious to adopt such measures as shall “ secure the Somalis from all interference.” On the 3rd February 1874,* a further letter was sent to the Foreign ^ Office, enclosing another letter from * Mr. Menvale to Foreign Office, A j AT 01 p jv o-i j. t-v i 3rd February 1874. Aden, No. 81, of the 31st December 1873, in which the Resident reported the arrival of Munzinger Pasha at Berbera, and an alleged statement by him to the captain of a French vessel of war which had recently been at Massowah, that the Egyptians intended to annex the entire Somali coast- up to Cape Guardafui. “ It will be observed from the papers,” wrote Mr. Merivale, “ that the Egyptians appear determined to occupy Berbera, “ a proceeding which, as the Duke of Argyll has already stated, it would “ be obviously inexpedient to view with indifference. I am therefore to “ request that you will move Earl Granville to take the matter into his “ early consideration.” 1874.5 Lord Tenterden replied,* that the proceedings of the Egyptians at * T 7 -pi . ^^ , Berbera were under Lord Granville’s * rrom foreign Oince,9th February i i ii i i o 18 74 b J consideration, but that he was of opinion that the matter should be dealt with in connection with the general question of Egyptian and Turkish claims to sovereignty and acquisitions on those coasts, upon which a memorandum was being prepared s On the 13th Eebruary 1874, the Government of India again called A ^ tv tvt or j . , 0 x 1 attention to the question,! and added,— t From India, No. 35, dated 13th „ -r, • u .V . , , , February 1874. 18 ver y necessary that we should “ be furnished with early instructions “ as to the policy to be pursued with reference to the proceedings of the “ Turkish and Egyptian officials at Berbera, and in the neighbouring of “ that port.” On the 12th March, the Eoreign Office forwarded a memorandum X by . ^ , j Mr. Hertslet on the “Turkish claim to March 1874. sovereignty over the Eastern shore ol “ the Bed Sea and the whole of Arabia; “ and on the Egyptian claim to the whole of the western shore of the “ same sea, including the African coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui.” The memorandum is nothing less than a consecutive history of the events which have taken place in that quarter of the globe during the last 50 years, and is much too long for quotation, but Mr. Hertslet’s summary of facts may be giveir verbatim. 1. The Erench have repeatedly endeavoured to establish a footing on the western shores of the Bed Sea at Disseh, at Amphylla, at Edd, at Obokh, and elsewhere, but hitherto without success. 2. The Erench have acknowledged the sovereignty of the Sultan over Zeyla, by appealing to him against the conduct of the ruler of that place in the case of M. Lambert. 3. The Turks have, as recently as 1862, hoisted their flag at Disseh, Adoolis, and Edd. 4. The Italians endeavoured, some few years ago, to establish them selves at Assab Bay, but without success. 5. In 1835, before the opening of the Suez Canal, the Americans attempted to found an agency or factory on the south coast of Arabia, which they visited in two ships of war. 6. Since January 1838, the English have established themselves at Aden, and on the island of Perim; they have concluded treaties with numerous tribes in the Yemen, thereby acknow ledging their separate independence ; they have also concluded treaties with the Chiefs of Zeyla, Tajourra, and Berbera, thereby acknowledging the independence of these rulers. 7. The English have also acquired the islands of Mussa and Aubad by cession from the Chiefs of Zeyla and Tajourra, although it is true they have never occupied them. 8. The British Government have refused to acknowledge the Sultan’s claim to any part of Arabia outside the Straits of Bab-el- M an deb. 9. In 1839, Lord Palmerston declared that the Sultan had no right whatever over the country governed by the Chiefs of the interior of Arabia. 10. The British Government have never recognized the claim put forward by the Viceroy of Egypt to any portion of the African coast outside the same Straits, even as far as Zeyla, much less as far as Cape Guardafui, which is probably only a step to a claim over the Somali coast as far as Bas-el-Khyle, if not further. 17641. B6 11. The Queen’s Advocate reported some few years back that, with regard to the Somali coast (which would include Berbera), the fact of the Sultan’s laying claim to it could hardly be con sidered sufficient to justify his right of sovereignty over the territory; that there was nothing to show he had ever occupied any portion of the territory by his troops, nor was there any proof that the various Chiefs paid him tribute (although this is now denied by the Egyptian Government), but, on the con trary, that these Chiefs considered themselves independent and recognized no other sovereign ruler over them. 12. Berhera has always been considered by the authorities of Aden as independent of either Turkish or Egyptian authority, and it is very important to Aden that nothing should be done to deter the Berbera people from bringing their live stock and other goods to that fortress. On the 12th May 1874, a further letter from the Resident at Aden * Sir L. Mallet to Foreign Office, WaS Sent f^to the Foreign Office,* with 12th May 1874. a request that Lord Derby’s attention n _ might be invited to the matter. The Government ot India had, on two recent occasions, requested an expres sion ot the policy of Her Majesty’s Government, and Lord Salisbury was anxious, belore expressing any opinion, to learn what views were held by Lord Derby on the question. In reply, the 1 oreign Officef requested to be furnished with a com- f From Foreign Office, 2nd June P rehen81ve statement, for COmmunica- 1874. tion to the Egyptian Government, ... i . . showing the precise nature of the treaty relations subsisting between Great Britain and the Somali and other tribes on the African coast of the Red Sea and Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the stipulations upon which it was considered desirable that Her Majesty s Government should lay particular stress. A memorandum was accordingly prepared by Colonel Burne, which embodied the principal provisions of the various treaties, and has been printed as an Appendix (A) to this abstract. This memorandum, with others by Sir Bartle Erere and General Tremenheere, formerly Resident at Aden, was sent to the Foreign Office on the 7th August 1874, in a t Lord George Hamilton to Foreign letter «ie purport of which was as fol- Office, 7th August 1874. iows. J Hie stipulations m the various treaties which were especially favour able to British interests, and which it would therefore be desirable to retain, were, in the Tajourra Treaty (No. 97), Articles 2 and 3, involving trade, with five per cent, duty with Tajourra and adjacent ports, and unrestricted commerce; in the Zeyla Treaty (No. 98), Article 1 to the same effect; in the Berbera Treaties, Article 2 in No. 99, iuvolvin o&gt; free trade with Berbera and other ports under the Habr Owul tribes, and Articles 3 and 5 in No. 100, the first to the same effect, the second securing the privilege of sending British Agents to Berbera durino* the trading season to see that the provisions of the treaty are observed. The treaty with Shoa was included in the memorandum, as bearing in some measure on those entered into with Zeyla and Tajourra. There were also certain bonds and articles of agreement with the Chiefs of Mait and elsewhere, and those of the Habr Owul, affecting the slave trade, which Lord Derby might consider it desirable to bring to the notice of the Egyptian Government. Attention was also drawn to Article 7 of Treaty XCVII. and Article 3 of Treaty XCVIIL, which appealed to prohibit the Chiefs of Zeyla and Tajourra from entering into any bond or treaty with European or other powers which might prove detrimental or injurious to the interests of the British Government, either in a political or commercial point of view, involving at the same7 time a promise on our part not to act in any manner which might have an evil tendency towards those States. T-he letter concluded, - Lord “ Salisbury would not be disposed, on full consideration of all the cir- “ cumstances of the case, whether as regards the suppression of the “ slave trade or British Indian interests in general, to promote any « measures which might encourage or facilitate the extension of Egyptian “ power along the African seaboard beyond the Straits of Bab-el- *• Mandeb.” The Foreign Office replied on the 21st August.* After recapitulating certain passages of our letter, Lord * From Foreign Office, 21st August rp er d er(leri quoted at length the articles 1874 ‘ in the treaties with Zeyla and Tajourra, and wrote with regard to them “ Lord Salisbury will observe that in “ both these articles the engagement is that no treaty or bond shall be “ entered into with any other European nation or person without, in the “ first instance, bringing the subject to notice of the Government “ authorities at Aden. It would appear, from the printed memorandum “ prepared in this Office, of which a copy was enclosed in my letter ol “ the 12th March last, that the authority of the Turkish Government “ extended over Zeyla and Tajourra several years ago, at all events in “ 1864, and Lord Derby considers that some further informalion should “ be obtained as to the manner in which that authority was first “ extended to these places, and whether, at the time, the subject was “ brought to the notice of the British authorities at Aden, as contem- “ plated by these treaties, and, if so, what notice was taken of it. With regard to Lord Salisbury’s indisposition to encourage the ex tension of Egyptian power beyond the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, it was remarked,—“As Zeyla and Tajourra have thus been for so long under “ the authority of the Forte, Lord Derby apprehends that there is now “no practical' question of repressing the extension of Egyptian power “ beyond the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and that the alternative now “ lies between regulating the existing state of things and leaving matters “ to take their course.” Upon this point Lord Salisbury s attention was called to the fact that when, a propos of the firman oi Ibbb, Colonel Merewether recommended that the Turkish Government should be called upon to desire their authorities to abstain from interfering with places outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb except Zeyla and Tajourra, Her Majesty’s Government did not concur in the suggestion, and Lord Lyons was instructed that all that Her Majesty’s Government con sidered it necessary that he should do was to request the Porte to give such directions to' its authorities in that quarter as would prevent native boats trading between the African coast and Aden from future molestation. Lord Tenterden concluded,—“ In view of the difficulties “ with which the question is surrounded, Lord Derby has decided to “ consult General Stanton before making any representation to the “ Egyptian Government, and the papers will accordingly be sent to “ him to report upon.” On the 25th September,! the correspondence, so far as it had gone, was sent to the Government of India, f To India.

On the same day Sir Louis Mallet replied to the Foreign Office,! that a reference had been made to India tor { Sir Louis Mallet 'to Foreign details relating t o Zeyla and Tajourra, Office, 25th September is, 4. arld that meanwhile it might be pre-8 * mature to discuss how far those places might be said to have passed under the dominion of Egypt. The letter, however, went on,— “In regard to the authority of the Porte over these places, there are “ no doubt grounds for believing that, since its occupation of certain ^ portions oi the Arabian Coast in 1849, the Turkish Government has c assumed suzerainty over the first named town in virtue of an annual “ payment of ancient date made by its Chief to the Sheriff of Mocha. « T} l ere 1S ’ h° wever &gt; nothing on record in this Office to show that the “ Chiefs of Zeyla and Tajourra have ever disregarded the stipulations of , ^ treaties entered into with the British Government in a manner to necessitate the interference of the British authorities at Aden, or that ‘ these treaties have ever been called in question by foreign powers. The claims of the Egyptian Government to the territory occupied by the Somalis south of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, including Berbera * Foreign Office to India Office, “ I! , ull if &gt; were cleariy set forth* in 28th July 1870. “ 18*0 by the Khedive s Eoreign Mim- “ ster, who asserted that the territory in “ question had f ton jours H6 Ottoman, sur lequel flottait depuis des cc f t ' 1 * s drapeau Ottoman, and that ‘ en vertu d’un firman Im- “ c periale il a ete compris dans la cession faite par la Porte au Gouvernement Egyptian des provinces de Massowa et de Souakin, “ ‘ amsi que de leurs ddpendances.’ Kmd Salisbury has nothing in his possession to show that Zeyla and 41 a J 0U ^ w ® re eyer considered to be dependencies of Massowa or Souakin, or that kmtan had given Zeyla and Tajourra to Egypt, or could show ‘ any real claim to a right of sovereignty over the coast line fromBab-el- { anae } ^. 0 Guardafui sufficient to justify the demands of the Khedive to annex it under authority of the firmans of 1866 and 1873. { These circumstances have made it desirable to draw Eord Derby’s c{ attention to the stipulations of our engagements with Zeyla and C( . lajoura, m order that they may not be forgotten in the projected com- c£ ^unication to the Egyptian Government, or be hereafter ignored by the “ Khedive on the ground that their omission implied a consent to abandon to claims yet unproved the territories and commerce of Somali Chiefs “ whose transfer to the sovereignty of Egypt might interfere with the tieaties of 1840, and is apparently not justified in official records. “ Salisbury is the more desirous of inviting attention to this matter m view of the decided opinion of the Indian Government “ objecting to a compliance with the request of the Khedive to cede His Highness certain islands obtained from Zeyla and Tajourra under the “ same engagements of 1840, the validity of which engagements His Highness did not attempt to challenge. CC cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc In gh ing this explanation I am to remind you that, whatever may be the ultimate policy of Her Majesty’s Government in regard to the above mentioned places, Berbera stands in a different and more im portant position, although it is claimed under pretence of the same hrman. It is opposite Aden, it commands the supplies of that port, and the claims of Turkish or Egyptian suzerainty over it have been in no way previously assumed or recognized. As far, therefore, as the information now before him enables him to judge, Eord Salisbury is inclined to adhere to the opinion that the extension of Egyptian power over the Somali Coast (with especial reference to Bulhar and Berbera) is not, under existing circumstances, o ic desired ; for it cannot be looked upon at present as tending to to the suppression of the slave trade or the diminution of Ottoman influence m the neighbourhood of Aden.”9 ■pi'i.i iiiipui ' fyruwsm On the 14th October 1874, Mr. Lister forwarded, for any remarks Lord Salisbury might wish to make, vT Foreign 0ffice &gt; 14th 0c ’ copy of a Despatch, dated 15th Sep tember, from Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General in Egypt, reporting his views on the question, in which Lord Derby was inclined to concur. General Stanton recapitulated the recent course of events, which showed that Berbera and the Somali Coast appeared to have been for at least four years in the nominal pos session of the Egyptian Government. At the same time, he had reason to believe that Zeyla was not included amongst these possessions, and was not under Egyptian administration, but was, on the contrary, still administered by a Sheikh under the orders of the Pasha of Hodeida, to whom a certain annual tribute was paid,—a circumstance sufficient to prove the weakness of the claim of the Egyptian Government to the possession of these territories as dependencies of the province of Mas- sowah. Without, however, entering into the question of the abstract right of the Porte, General Stanton considered that the establishment on the Somali Coast of a regular administration capable of suppressing inter-tribal feuds offered more serious guarantees of friendly relations with Aden than were afforded by the existing commercial treaties with with the Sheikhs of Berhera, Zeyla, and Tajourra. The Egyptian Government, so far as he could judge, desired to maintain the most friendly relations with Her Majesty’s Government, and the fears ex pressed by the Government of India that the occupation of Berhera by the Egyptians would endanger the provisioning of Aden appeared to him chimerical. By the commercial treaty in force between Great Britain and the Porte, which was also at present binding on Egypt, the export duty payable on the produce of the Ottoman Empire was only one per cent, ad valorem, which was more advantageous to the residents at Aden than the terms of the Zeyla and Tajourra treaties, which speci fied a five per cent, duty on all produce. There was, moreover, reason to believe that no objection would be raised by the Egyptian Govern ment to Berbera and the other ports on that part of the African Coast being declared free ports, as in the treaty concluded with the Habr Owul tribe. General Stanton doubted whether Egyptain occupation of the coast would have the disastrous effect with reference to the slave trade, antici pated by some ; on the contrary, it would, he imagined tend rather to the suppression of the traffic in those regions by the substitution, for the present divided authority, of a strong Government which could be held responsible for the acts of its subjects and for the due performance of its treaty obligations in the matter. Nor did he see any reason to suppose that traders in general would be either discouraged or oppressed or that monopolies would be set up. The recognition of Egyptian right to the coast would also prevent any attempts at occupation by other powers, and, though it was not for him to judge whether such an occupation might prove detrimental or otherwise to British interests, it might, he thought, be assumed that the Egyptian Government would be more ready to listen to and act on the representations of Her Majesty’s Government, and to give greater trading facilities to Her Ma jesty’s subjects, than other powers who might possibly become possessed of that country, in the event of the Egyptain claim being disallowed. Under these circumstances, General Stanton recommended that, “ both “ for political and commercial reasons, as well as with a view to the “ suppression of the East African slave trade, the right of the Egyptian “ Government to the Somali country should be recognized by Her Ma- “ jesty’s Government, under the conditions that Berbera and the other “ ports on the coast should be declared free, that facilities should be “ given for opening up commercial relations between Abyssinia and the “ Egyptian ports, and that the Egyptian Gouernment should enter into 17641. C10 “ a formal engagement to prohibit the export of slaves and to use every “ endeavour to suppress the slave trade within its territory.” Sir Louis Mallet replied* to the above letter that the whole of the papers in the matter having been re- L&lt; 1 &gt;U1S t0 Forei S n 0ffice &gt; f erre( i to the Government of India, Lord Salisbury desired to reserve any expres sion of opinion on General Stanton’s despatch, until he was in possession of the views of that Government. Those views were expressed in Political Letter from India, No. 184, dated 9th October 1874, as follows :— “ With respect to Berbera and the African coast westward, towards “ the Bed Sea it would probably be very difficult now to counteract the “ influence of the Egyptian Government. During the last four years, “ Egypt has openly committed herself to an assertion of authority over “ those portions of the coast, by the stationing of garrisons at several “ places, and by the display of her flag. She would, doubtless, he reluc- “ tant to recede from the position she has assumed, and we cannot advise “ that any remonstrance should he made, unless Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment are prepared to take further action to give effect to their views “ in the event of remonstrances being disregarded. “ We consider it undesirable that any serious differences should exist “ between the British Government * and the Turkish or Egyptian “ Governments on questions of this kind. Unfortunately, our own “ interests at Aden and the obligations we have contracted by treaties “ with several States and tribes in Arabia, have compelled us to oppose “ the proceedings of the Turkish authorities in the neighbourhood of “ Aden, and, in some instances, on the shores of the Persian Gulf. But “ when no such obligations have been undertaken on our part, and when “ British interests do not require our intervention, it is, in our opinion, “ most expedient, as far as possible, to avoid interfering with the pro- “ ceedings of the Turkish or Egyptian Governments in Africa and “ Arabia. “ In this view it appears to us advisable that some amicable under- “ standing should be come to with the Porte or the Khedive in regard “ to the commercial and other advantages which we wish to preserve at “ Berbera and elsewhere, and that so long as these are maintained we “ should not oppose the extension of the Turkish or Egyptian power on “the African coast. Indeed, if the establishment of other European “ Powers on the African coast of the Gulf of Aden be deemed disadvan- “ tageous to our interests, there would, in our opinion, he less likelihood “ of such powers obtaining a footing on those coasts were the country “ consolidated under the Egyptian rule, than while it remains parcelled “ out among a number of barbarous tribes.” The above views, it will he observed, were in substantial accordance with those of General Stanton, and indicated a complete change of opinion on the part of the Government of India. The letter con taining them was not sent on to the Eoreign Office, as it was thought advisable to wait for the special details in regard to Zeyla and Tajourra, which had been asked for. Early in January 1875, the Besident at Aden reported to the Govern- 1875. ment of India that a dhow belonging to an inhabitant of Aden had been attacked and captured, while engaged in peaceful trade, by the Terad Somalis, that the dhow and her crew had been released, hut that the tribe refused reparation on the ground that Ainterad had submitted to the Egyptian Government, whose flag was flying on the fort and the pirate craft. The Besident considered it necessary to take prompt measures in order to prevent the interruption of trade and restore a feeling of security along the coast, he therefore asked permission to bombard the fort and blockade Ainterad, giving notice to the Egyptian11 Pasha at Berbera, as a matter of courtesy. In reporting the matter • Political, dated 15th January 1870, t,,e Government of India wrote :* No. io. l n our opinion the Resident cannot “ be allowed to bombard a fort flying “ the Egyptian flag, unless it be certain that the flag is not rightfully “ hoisted. We would, therefore, suggest that Her Majesty’s Government “ should call on the Egyptian Government to state distinctly whether “ E gypt hays claim to Ainterad. If so, the Egyptian Government might “ be called upon to pay compensation. If not, it will rest with the “ British Government to take its own measures to obtain redress. It t( will, no doubt, occur to your Lordship that this case is complicated by &lt;c the fact that the Egyptian claim to the African coast from Suez to “ Cape Guardafui remains undecided.” The papers were sent to the Foreign Office,f with an intimation of t Sir L. Mullet to Foreign Office, Salisbury’s opinion that, in the 13th February 1875. present stage o± the question as to the sovereignty over the Somali coast, and in the absence of the further information on that subject promised by the Government of India, it would be of doubtful policy to make any refer ence to the Khedive in the sense indicated by that Government, and a suggestion that the case might be dealt with by a blockade of Ainterad, if such a measure did not involve hazard of giving just cause of offence to the Egyptian Government. Lord I)erby,J however, considered that no decision could he arrived at } From Foreign Office, 20th Feb- to the course which should he followed ruary 1875. until the larger question of Egyptian rights over the Somali coast had been settled. The action taken by Her Majesty’s Government would involve a practical decision on the point in dispute, whatever line of policy might be decided. An appeal to the Egyptian Government for reparation would be a practical recognition of their right of authority over Ainterad, while, on the other hand, if orders were given by Her Majesty’s Govern ment to blockade and bombard the place, one of two things would be affirmed,—either that the Egyptians had no jurisdiction there, or that they were not in a position to enforce it. Under these circumstances, Lord Derby thought that it would be wiser to await the report of the Indian Government upon the encroachments of Egypt on the Somali coast when the question of sovereignty could he treated as a whole, and not in an incidental manner. The expected report was sent home in a Secret Letter, No. 12, dated 5th March 1875, in the shape of a memorandum embodying all the information in possession of the Government of India and procurable from local records. Further reference to this document is unnecessary, except in regard to the particular point on which the Foreign Office had requested details, viz., the origin of the Turkish claim to Zeyla. It appeared that that place had been a dependency of Mokha, and that when the Porte obtained the final mastery over the Bed Sea Arabian coast in 1842-43 it inherited the possessions on the African side which, as then understood, were confined to Zeyla and Tajourra. Before the above information had been received, the occurrence at Ainterad, and the necessity of furnishing the Resident at Aden with a clear rule for his guidance, had satisfied Lord Salisbury that it was desirable to ascertain, with as little delay as possible, the view which Lord Derby entertained as to the Egyptian claims. His Lordship’s own views were expressed in a letter § to the Foreign Office, dated 23rd March 1875, of which the material paragraphs were as follows :— “ In my letter of the 25th September last, I drew your attention to £ ‘ certain stipulations in our treaty engagements with the Sultans of § Sir L. Mallet to Foreign Office, dated 23rd March 1875.12 “ Zeyla and Tajourra, the Habr Owul clan of the Berhera tribe, and the “ Chiefs of Hais, Racooda, Unkor, Kurrum, and Ainterad, which had an “ important hearing upon this question; and I intimated that, in Lord “ Salisbury’s opinion, the existence of such engagements with these “ tribes involved in serious doubt the policy of permitting their inde- “ pendence to be extinguished. “ 4 . Lord Salisbury expressed this opinion with special reference to “ Balhar and Berbera. He had before him a correspondence extending “ over a period of many years, which contained opinions from the Go- “ vernment of India and successive Residents at Aden, that such exten- “ sion of Egyptian power might not only menace generally our position “ at Aden, but also obstruct the provisioning of that place, which was “ largely effected from those parts, and he failed to trace any substantial “ grounds for the Egyptian claim to the coast except the implied autho- “ rity of certain firmans issued by the Porte in 1866 and 1873, the “ validity of which was open to serious doubt; it was also to be feared “ that the possession of the coast by the Egyptians, in the face of &lt;c evidence which seemed to a certain extent to implicate their officials “ in slave trade proceedings, might not only weaken the hands of Her “ Majesty’s Government in their efforts to put a stop to that abomin- “ able traffic, but lead to possible complications in the event of dhows “ flying Egyptian colours being captured in the Red Sea by British “ men of war. “ 5. There are, however, two considerations bearing in the opposite “ sense, which desire to be carefully weighed. It appears that, for the “ last five years, the Egyptian Government has openly committed itself “ to an assertion of authority over Berbera and the adjacent coast, by “ the stationing of garrisons and the display of its flag at more than one “ place, and that this has been effected without any formal remon- “ strance from Her Majesty’s Government, or any apparent objection on “ the part of the tribes. Erom this claim it is not likely that Egypt “ will recede, except under the pressure of measures on the part of “ Her Majesty’s Government more decided than mere remonstrances. “ Practically, therefore, the only result we can attain by declining to “ recognize the sovereignty of Egypt, is to prolong the uncertain “ ownership of the coast which, is even now the cause of some em- “ barrassment. “ 6. It must also be remembered that this uncertainty may be termi- “ nated by other hands than ours. The possible establishment of other “ European powers on the African coast of the Gulf of Aden is a con- “ tingency which should be borne in mind. Abortive efforts in that “ direction have been made, and indications are not wanting that they “ may possibly be renewed. Such an event would, under present cir- “ cumstances, be most detrimental to our interests, and would doubtless “ be less likely to occur w T ere the country consolidated under Egyptian “ rule than were it to remain parcelled out among a number of barbarous “ tribes. « 7. Under all the circumstances of the case, Lord Salisbury is dis- “ posed to think, after much careful consideration, that it might be “ more advantageous for Her Majesty’s Government to arrive at an “ amicable understanding with the Khedive in regard to the sovereignty “ of the Egyptian Government over the Somali coast, and the com- “ mercial and other advantages which we desire to preserve at Berbera “ and elsewhere. “ 8. It is for Lord Derby to decide upon the definite form which the “ negotiations on this matter should assume, and whether they should te be carried on direct or through the Porte. It might be sufficient to “ propose to Egypt a convention, recognizing her sovereignty more as a “ friendly concession than an acknowledgment of right, and embodying “ all our principal treaty stipulations with the tribes on the Somali “ coast, with especial reference to freedom from monopolies, the unre-*4 13 ** stricted importation into Aden of live stock at current prices, our right “ to establish an Agent at Berbera, and such regulations in regard to slave “ trade matters as may appear suitable to Lord Derby. Dor the purpose, “ however, of retaining permanently our influence on the coast, it would “ be of the greatest importance to obtain from Egypt a formal under- “ taking not to part with her sovereignty over any portion of it to any “ other Power. “ 9. Lord Salisbury desires to remind Lord Derby of the position in “ which the British Government stands in regard to the Mussa islands and “ the islands of Bab and Auhad, which were some years ago absolutely “ ceded to it. He is not inclined to think that there would he much “ advantage in retaining these islands, which have never been inhabited “ or occupied. Their cession to Egypt might indeed be proposed as an “ additional consideration for any concession desired by Her Majesty’s “ Government.” Lord Tenterden replied, on the 2nd April,* that Lord Derby concurred . „ „ . _ 0 3 A in Lord Salisbury’s views as to coming 18 75 ^ to an arrangement with the Khedive, and proposed to consult Sir Henry Elliot and General Stanton as to the manner in which this had best be done. The question of ceding the British islands on the coast to Egypt might be dealt with separately, but it must be borne in mind that the French likewise possessed rights at Obokh. The information contained in Mr. Herslet’s memorandum of the 5th March 1874, before referred to, on the subject of French proceedings at Obokh, may conveniently be summarized here. In 1862, certain natives of Zeyla, who had been taken to France under suspicion of having been concerned in the murder of a French subject, M. Lambert, were taken back to their country in a French ship of war from Suez, on board of which was M. Schaeffer, Chief Dragoman to the French Embassy at Constantinople. Various rumours prevailed as to the object of this gentleman’s voyage, but Mons. Thouvenel’s explanation to Earl Cowley was that he had been sent to Massowah for the purpose of obtaining a coaling station for the line of French steamers about to be established on the Bed Sea, and that there w T as no foundation for the report that France meditated acquirements or conquests on that sea. A desert spot called Agos or Abos (Obokh), Mons. Thouvenel observed, had been pointed out to the Minister of Marine as affording a safe har bour and good water, and it was hoped that a depdt for coals might be found there. It afterwards transpired that, as the French vessel de scended the Red Sea, a careful survey was made of the coast from Mas sowah to Zeyla, and that, although the French had by their proceedings with regard to Zeyla, recognized the sovereignty of the Porte over that place, the officers on board the vessel had purchased Obokh from the Native Governor of Tajourra and Rahaita for 10,000 dollars. This spot, which, though sometimes called an “ island ” appears to be on the mainland on the north shore of the bay of Zeyla, nearer to the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb than that place, they took formal possession of in the name of the Emperor Napoleon, and hoisted the French flag. In the following year (1863) General Coghlan visited Obokh, and, from inquiries he made of the “ chief man ” of the place, learned that the people denied the right of the Sultan of Raheita to sell their country; that they acknowledged as their Chief one Mahomed Ali, who resided originally at Bosalee, distant two days’ journey, and had avowed his intention to oppose French occupation ; that the French had set up two landmarks and placed three buoys, and had then left the place, when the people at once removed the marks and the buoys ; that there was no sign of any intention on the part of the French to occupy Obokh; that they had neither material, nor establishment, nor agency on the spot; and that the character of the place suggested a doubt whether they at any time seriously intended to occupy it. 17641, T&gt;14 * Sir Louis Mallet to Foreign Office, 21st April 1875. f From Foreign Office, 19th May 1875. J Lord G. Hamilton Office, 11th June 1875. to Foreign General Coglilan further stated that the single advantage of Obokh was its good water supply, but that, in every other respect, it was objec tionable ; there was no port properly deserving the name; it had no capabilities as a settlement; had no neighbourhood; produced nothing ; led nowhere; was inconveniently far from the track of the Hed Sea steamers; and the fine plain to the westward of it was uninhabitable by reason of a pestilential marsh which, for at least half the year, was directly to windward of it, and was so offensive at that time that no one would willingly pass a night in its vicinity. So far, Mr. Hertslet. It is believed that the French have never actually occupied Obokh since 1863, but in Keith Johnstone’s Atlas (Edition of 1868), the.place is marked as a possession of France, and the French Ambassador at Constantinople has, quite recently, asserted to the Porte, the claim of his Government to it. On the 21st April, the Memorandum sent home by the Government of India was forwarded to the Foreign Office,* and it was at the same time stated that Lord Salisbury concurred in Lord Derby’s proposal to consult Sir H. Elliot and General Stanton on the subject of the contemplated arrangement with the Khedive. On the 19th May the Foreign Office forwarded drafts of two de spatches,! which Lord Derby proposed to address to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General in Egypt. In reply,| I^ord Salisbury’s concurrence in the drafts was intimated, subject to some slight verbal alterations, intended to indicate more clearly the precise intentions of Her Majesty’s Government. The material passages in the despatch to Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt may be quoted :— “ You are already acquainted with the treaties into which Her ‘ Majesty’s Government have entered at various times with the Somali ‘ Chiefs and with the circumstances under which Great Britain acquired £ possession of the islands of Mussa, Bab, and Aubad. “ You will remember that the Khedive has expressed a wish to recover 4 these islands, and stated his belief that if they were ceded to him by ‘ England, he would be enabled to resist the claim of the French ‘ Government to Obokh. “ Her Majesty’s Government on their part would not be unwilling to 4 surrender their right to the islands in question, provided that the 4 French claim to Obokh was also relinquished, and would, in any case, 4 require an assurance that no foreign Government was left in possession 4 of territory in those waters. They would further require from Egypt 4 a guarantee that no portion of the African Coast in the hands of 4 Egypt shall at any time be ceded to any foreign power. 44 As regards the ports of Berbera and Bulhar Her Majesty’s Govern- 4 ment are more immediately concerned, inasmuch as it is of vital 4 importance to the welfare and comfort of Aden that those ports 4 should continue to be an open mart from whence Aden can obtain, as 4 heretofore, a constant and unrestricted supply of live stock, provisions, 4 and other necessaries. This right has been secured to the Government 4 of Great Britain by treaty,” &amp;c 44 Trusting in the friendly relations between England and Egypt, Her 4 Majesty’s Government are willing to recognize the African Coast of 4 the Bed Sea, as far as Cape Guardafui, as part of the Ottoman 4 dominions under the rule of the Khedive of Egypt, upon the condi- 4 tions that the Egyptian Government shall enter into a formal engage- 4 ment to prohibit the export of slaves along her entire coast, Zeyla and15 “ Tajourra included, and to use every endeavour to suppress the slave ** trade within the Somali territory, and afford every facility for the “ prevention of the slave trade in Egyptian waters as well as in the “ neighbouring seas. “ Her Majesty’s Government would also reserve the right of stationing “ British Agents at one or each of the ports on the coast, and they “ would also expect that the police of those waters should be properly “ established by the Egyptian Government so as to prevent a recurrence “ of piratical attacks under cover of the Egyptian flag, such as that of “ which Her Majesty’s Government have so recently had occasion to “ complain at Ainterad. “ It now only remains to consider in what form these negotiations “ had best be brought about, and I shall he glad to he furnished with “ your opinion upon this point, as well as with regard to the form of “ convention which it is desirable to adopt in order to obtain the proposed “ object.” .... The despatch to Sir H. Elliot at Constantinople was to the same effect, but had a final paragraph in the following terms :—“ The Porte “ must understand that the proposal of Her Majesty’s Government only “ applies to the Somali Coast of Africa. At the same time, should your “ Excellency he able to obtain from the Porte a positive disclaimer of “ any claims to sovereignty over the nine tribes in the vicinity of Aden, “ Her Majesty’s Government would consider it might advantageously he “ introduced into the contemplated engagement in the interests of the “ friendly relations between the two countries, and as a final and satis- “ factory settlement of these long standing questions of sovereignty in “ Southern Arabia and on the Somali Coast.” On the 12th July the Eoreign Office* forwarded a memorandum by t i General Stanton, who was then in 18 * 5 * rom Forei ° n ice &gt; 11 England, in which that Officer stated that, as it was specified amongst the conditions of the proposed negotiations that Zeyla and Tajourra, as well as the other parts of the coast, should be declared free ports, and that the Egyptian Government should enter into a formal engagement to prohibit the export of slaves along her entire coast, Zeyla and Tajourra included, and as those two ports were not at present under Egyptian rule, hut were considered as dependencies of the Yemen and under the orders of the Ottoman Governor of that province, it appeared to him essential that, before entering into any agreement, either with the Porte or with the Khedive, which would recognize the Somali coast as part of the Ottoman dominions, the Khedive should obtain from the Porte the formal cession of these two ports, and be recognized by the Sultan as ruler over the Somali tribes. General Stanton went on:—“ An “ Imperial firman, acknowledging Zeyla and Tajourra and the whole “ 0 f the Somali coast as under the rule of Egypt could not, I appre- “ bend, in any way affect the question of the recognition by Her “ Majesty’s Government of the Sultan’s rights to that territory, whilst “ it would remove the difficulty which undoubtedly now stands in the “ way of the acceptance by the Khedive of the terms of the proposed “ Convention, and I have no doubt whatever that, this difficulty re- “ moved, His Highness would gladly accept the conditions specified by “ Her Majesty’s Government. « Should, however, the Somali coast be recognized as a part of the “ Ottoman dominions, whilst a part of the coast is still under Turkish “ rule, considerable difficulty might possibly be experienced in obtaining “ the consent of the Porte to the specified conditions with regard to “ Zeyla and Tajourra, and Egypt could not be in a position to conclude “ the necessary convention with Her Majesty’s Government, either for “ the creation of the free ports, or for the prohibition of the export of “ slaves along the entire coast.”16 Sir H. Elliot, in a memorandum dated the 19th July,* expressed his * Letter from Foreign Office, 24th concurrence in the above views July 1875. (jeneral Stanton. His Excellency was not acquainted with the precise terms in which the administration of Zeyla had just been granted to the Khedive, hut it was desirable that authority over Tajourra and the whole Somali coast should be made over to him by the Porte before nego tiations respecting the acknowledgment by Her Majesty’s Government of the Sultan’s sovereignty were entered upon. Such acknowledgment would have to be conveyed to the Porte rather than to the Khedive, whose administration only of the coast would have to be recognized. The Porte might not be disposed to look upon the arrangement as an “ extension” of territory, the annual payment hitherto made by some of the Sheikhs being adduced as evidence that they were already subjects of the Sultan. As regards the islands, Sir H. Elliot wrote as follows:— “ The cession should, I think, be made by a convention with the Porte, “ embodying an engagement that the islands should be placed under the “ Khedive, as administering the Somali coast, and that no other foreign “ power shall be permitted to hold or acquire territory upon the coast, t Sic. “ an( ^ on ^ ie condition that the French abandon (the islandf “ of) Obokh. An engagement to the same effect might be obtained from the Khedive. The Turkish Government would be “ gratified by the cession of the British islands, but however desirous of “ obtaining the relinquishment of Obokh by the French, whether they “ would be likely to be able to procure it is a point upon which I have “ no information. I am not aware that the Porte has ever recognized the right of the French to Obokh, but as long as that Government “ asserts a theoretical claim to it, the Porte might hesitate to take an “ engagement to permit no foreign power to hold territory on the coast, “ which might lead to future difficulty between them if the island is to “ be regarded as included in the word ‘ coast.’ ”... The last firman granted to the Khedive empowered him to make commercial treaties with foreign powers, the arrangements proposed in regard to trade would therefore properly be embodied in a Convention between Her Majesty’s Government and the Khedive. Sir H. Elliot considered unadvisable any reference to the question of Turkish sovereignty over the nine tribes in the vicinity of Aden. The Foreign Office letter of 2ith July, which forwarded this memo randum by Sir H. Elliot, also enclosed a Despatch from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Ottoman Ambassador in London, communicated by him to Lord Derby, stating that Zeyla had, by a firman of the Sultan, been placed under the Government of the Khedive. In regard to this Lord Derby expresses doubts whether this notification of the Turkish Government should be accepted without remark, seeing that Zeyla was one of the places over which the sovereignty of the Porte had been questioned by Her Majesty’s Government, and asked for Lord Salisbury’s opinion as to the notice which should be taken of the com munication. Sir Louis Mallet replied§ as follows:—“ I am to state that Lord c q* r at 11 f ♦ tt “ Salisbury is of opinion that it is not 27th August 1875. expedient at present to recognize the “ legitimacy of this firman. It rests “ with Her Majesty’s Government to reserve to themselves full liberty in connexion with it, should the negotiations on the question of the Somali coast fall through, and the general subject remain in “ abeyance. “ Lord Salisbury observes that Major-General Stanton considers it essential that the Khedive should obtain from the Porte the 4 formal ‘ cession of Zeyla and Tajourra,’ and is of opinion, indeed, that an c&lt; Imperial firman, acknowledging these places and the ‘whole SomaliA P P E N D I C E S.

On the 6th of February 1827, a treaty of peace and commerce was concluded between Captain Bremer, of Her Majesty’s ship “ Tamar,” representing the English Nation in Northern Africa, and the Sheikhs of the tribe of Habr Ovvul, which was approved by the Bombay Government on the 10th of May following. The principal Articles of the Treaty, were :— Article II.

TaJOURRA AND ZeYLA. On the 19th of August 1840, a Commercial Treaty was concluded between Sultan Mahomed bin Mohummed (who died in 1862) of Tajourra, and Captain Moresby of the Indian N avy, on the part of the East India Company, the principal provisions of which were:—20 € 1st. That the English nation, and all vessels lawfully sailing under the British flag, having merchandise of any description on Article IT. of Treaty of 19th August 1840, b oar( l shall be respected and permitted, without No. 97, p. 314 of Aitchison’s Treaties, Vol. 7. . i- i , . • j* i x x* . .r • the slightest prejudice or molestation to their persons or effects, to enter and trade in the port of, and in all ports under the Government of Tajourra, paying a duty of five per cent, on all produce.

To this Treaty was attached a deed of sale of the island called Mussah, dated 19th August 1840. The island of Bab was ceded on the 27th idem. On the 3rd of September of the same year (1840), a treaty was entered into between Syud Mahomed Bar, Governor of Zaila, for himself and posterity, and Captain Moresby, of the Indian Navy, on the part of the East India Company, of which the principal provisions, although written in slightly different language, were exactly the same as those entered into with the Sultan of Tajourra. Article I. That the English nation, and all vessels, &amp;c., lawfully sailing under the British flagr, commanded by European or Native subjects of the English, having merchandise of any description, shall be respected and permitted, without the slightest prejudice or molestation to their person or effects, to enter and trade in the port of Zeyla, and all other ports under the Governor of Zeyla, paying a duty of five per cent, upon all produce. The subjects of the Governor of Zeyla shall also pay the same duty in all English ports. Article II. The Governor of Zeyla will endeavour all in his power to introduce British property and merchandise into the interior State of Zeyla, and engages at all times to protect, respect, and regard the person or persons of English and their subjects, and friendly advice of any authorized person or agent belonging to the British Govern ment, who while at Zeyla to be respected and regarded.

Geographical Notes. Abstract. The tribes inhabiting the Coast of Africa from the entrance of the Red Sea to Ras-ul-Khyle, in E. long. 49° 45', N. lat. 7° 43', are—1, the Danarklis ; 2, the Essah tribe ; 3, the Edoor Somalis; 4, the Mijjerteyn Somalis. 1. The Danarkli, or Danakil, tribe are to be found on the coast from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to the western extremity of the Gulf of Tajourra. 2. The Essah tribe inhabit the southern shores of this Gulf, and are bounded on the west by 3. The Edoor Somalis, who extend as far as Mait, in E. long. 47° 16'. 4. The Mijjerteyn Somalis inhabit the extremity of the eastern horn of Africa, and extend as far south as Ras-ul-Khyle, or nearly to the dominion of the Sultan of Zanzibar. The general aspect of the coast is as follows :— * The island of Perim, situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, divides the channel into two straits, and lies in lat. 12° 40^' N. From Bab-el-Mandeb the African coast trends south as far as Ras-al-Beer, a low sandy point in 11° 57^' N. lat. Here the Gulf of Tajourra makes a break in the coast line. On the northern shore of this inlet arc the towns of Obokb, in N. lat. 11° 58' and E, long. 43° 14', Ambaboo, and Tajourra, the latter the seat of the Sultan of the Danarkli (or Danakil) tribe. The southern shore is inhabited by the Essah tribe, the the only place of importance being Zeyla, in N. lat. 11° 22'. From Zeyla the coast line trends south-east as far as Bulhar, and thence due east to Berbera, in N. lat. 10° 26'; from this place its direction is, as a rule, east north-east as far as Cape Guardafui, in N. lat. 11° 51' and E. long 51° 16'. The country is inhabited by Somalis; this people may be divided into two great branches, the Edoor, inhabiting the country from Mait to the Essah tribe, and the Mijjerteyn, who possess the country about Guardafui, or rather that part of the eastern horn of Africa between Bunder Zaideh and Ras-ul-Khyle. The country between the two branches belongs to the Wursungli. The towns on the coast are Bulhar, Berbera, Kurrum, Ainterad, and Ankor, belonging to the Edoor, Bunder Marayeh, Bunder Khor, Bunder Ghasim, and Bunder Zaideh, belonging to the Mijjerteyn. From Guardafui to Ras-ul-Khyle, in 7° 43° N. lat., the Mijjerteyn tribe are still to be found. This region has in various older maps, &amp;c., borne the name of Ajan, which is, however, merely a corruption of an Arabic descriptive word. No towns are to be found on the seaboard, and but little is known of it and its inhabitants. Socotra Island lies east of Cape Guardafui, at a distance of about 100 miles, and is under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Keshin, on the Arabian Coast. The coast from Guardafui, or rather from Ras Hafun, in N. lat. 10° 27', has a general direction of south-west as far as the Equator. The name given to it south of Ras Aswad, in 4° 30' N. is the “ Banadir. 5 ' The principal ports and depots of trade are Warsheek, Magadoxo, Merka, and Brava. In 0° 14' S. lat. is the mouth of the Juba or Govind river, and from this point the coast line trends under the name of “ Bajunia,” still in a south-west direction, as far as the latitude of Zanzibar, in about 6° S. I. I. Tajourra. The chief towns of the Danerklis are Tajourra and Ambaboo, situated on the t orthern shores of the Gulf of Tajourra, and Roweita, in the interior. Obokh, a former French settlement in this district, is situated near Ras-al-Beer, in N. lat. 10° 58' and E. long. 43° 14'. The harbour is described in the sailing directions ns merely a gap in the shore reefs where a tolerable anchorage in 15 fathoms water is obtainable. Good water is at all times to be procured. In the entrance of the Gulf of Tajourra, which is a wide and deep inlet running in a westerly direction, are to be found the Mussa Islands, which were ceded to England in 1840. They are described as surrounded by coral reefs and dangerous to approach. The Danarklis are sub-divided into four tribes, the Abd-ali, the Abli, the Debeuk, and the Rookbeh; their territory extends inland to the borders of the kingdom of Shoa. t23 II. Zeyla. £he Essah tribe are a Mahomedan race inhabiting the southern shore of the Gulf ol lajourra, and are bitter enemies of the Danarldis. The only place of importance is the chief town, Zeyla, which has a considerable trade with Mocha and other places; it was formerly the port through which the greater part of the commerce of the southern provinces of Abyssinia, as well as of Hurrur, left the country. Off the coast, at no great distance from Zaila, are the islands of Bab and Aubad which were ceded to England by the Sultan of Zeyla in 1840. III. Edoor Somalis. The country of the Edoor Somalis is, perhaps, better known by the name of its chief town Berbera Its western limits are contiguous to Zeyla, and the territory extends as far as Mait or Burnt Island, in east longitude 47° 16'. This branch of the Somalis may be subdivided into three clans, viz., the Habr Owul, inhabiting the lowlands from Berbera to Zeyla ; the Habr Gerhajis, inhabiting the frontier mountains t0 Tj? S » Ut .. c and the Habr - al -Jahleh, located to the east of Berbera. The name Habr signifies the son of,” and the three families are descended from the eons of one Isaakh, who crossed from Hadhramaut, some time after Ihis countrymin had founded the nation to the east, and who settled at the town of Mait, near Burnt Island, where his tomb exists to this day. The chief towns of the Habr Owul are Berbera and Bulhar, the former possessing the only safe harbour on the coast. It is remarkable for its annual fair, at which time the population attains the considerable number of 20,000 or 30,000 souls. In the dead time of the year this falls however to a few hundreds. The towns of the Habr-al-Jahleh are Mait, Hour, Hais, Rakoda, Unkor, Kurrum, and Ainterad. None of these are places of importance, except in the fact that they are alternative routes by which a constant supply of necessaries may be poured into Aden. r But little is known of the country of the interior. The city of Hurrur, in the province of the same name, is not, strictly speaking, in the Bar-es-Somal, but closely connected with Berbera, commercially speaking. It was visited by Captain Burton ml 8o4, prior to the calamity which overtook his ill-starred expeditionary party at Berbera before starting on its projected exploration of the regions north of Zanzibar. . He describes it in his work entitled “First Footsteps in Africa,” published in 1856. r Hurrur has been recently occupied by Egyptian troops, under Reouf Pasha, after a victorious engagement with the Galla inhabitants. Later accounts, however, show that the Lieutenants of the Khedive have considerable difficulty in maintainino- their position. ° Between the two great branches of the Somali tribe are a warlike race inhabiting the Wursoongh range of mountains to the east of Mait. A laro-e trade in frank incense is done by these people, and the climate of the district is described as most invigorating. IY. Mijjertyn Somalis. The second great tribe inhabiting the Bar-es-Somal, viz, the Mijijerteyn, are next to be met with on the African seaboard. Like the Ldoor, these Somalis also tract their origin from Hadhramaut Arabs, who, prior to the landing of Isaakh at Mait had colonized the extremity of the eastern horn of Africa as far west as the Wur- soongli, and extending their possessions southward to about the latitude of Ras-ul- Khyle. Little is known of this country, except that the inhabitants carry on a considerable trade m gum-arabic, myrrh, frankincense, and ostrich feathers The principal ports are Bunder Marayeh, Bunder Khor, Bunder Ghasim, and Bunder Ziadeh. At each of these there is a colony of Banian merchants, who have absoibed the greater part of the trade of the country. The districts of the interior are but little known to Europeans. From Eas-ul- khyle to Berbera the Wadi Nogal extends in almost a straight line between two ranges ol mountains The “happy valley ” is spoken of in the most glowing terms by the natives, and apparently forms their great road for trade. The people ol Ogahden and Murreyhan bring all their produce along this valley as being {he safest and least fatiguing route, and the inhabitants are described as a peaceful race In ancient times the whole north-east horn of Africa was known as Re&lt;do Aromatifera— the country of fragrant gums.24 r Accounts of the district will be found in the “Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,” Yols. XVIII. and XIX. One paper is written by Lieutenant Cruttenden, Indian Navy, and the other article by Mr. Cooley, the well known African geo grapher. It would certainly appear, from the most reliable sources of information, that the Somali tribes do not extend far into the interior, which is possessed by clans of Gallas and other cognate races. Further south, however, branches of the Mijjerteyn appear to have established themselves contiguous to the seaboard possessions of J^evyid Burghash, of Zanzibar, on the Banadir coast.6 * It Confidential. Egyptian Claims to Sovereignty over the Somali Coast (No. 2). * To Major-General Stanton, No. 63, dated 10th November 1875. See Memo- randum, 26th February 1876, p. 14. A memorandum submitted on the 26th February 1876 summarized the correspondence on this sub ject to that date. The matter had been supposed to be practically settled by the Convention which was signed at Alexandria on the 7th September 1877 ; but, in connection with the procedure at Constantinople necessary to give validity to the Convention, renewed discussion has lately arisen, and the position of the question is not altogether satisfactory. Under these circumstances, a con tinuation of the former paper to the present time may, perhaps, be found convenient. On the 10th November 1875, Lord Derby ad dressed despatches to Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt and to the British Ambassador at Con stantinople intimating the readiness of Her Majesty’s Government (1) to surrender their rights over the islands of Mussa, Bab, and Aubad, in the bay of Tajourrah, provided the French claim to Obokli, a point on the north shore of the bay, was also re linquished ; and (2) upon certain conditions to recognize the African coast as far as Cape Guardafui as part of the Ottoman dominions under the heredi tary rule of the Khedive.* The instructions embodied in these despatches were understood both by General Stanton and Sir H. Elliot as making the relinquishment of the French claim to Obokh a preliminary condition of the whole arrangement. Lord Derby, however, did not understand that this had been the intention of the instructions, which were framed with the object of dealing with the existing state of things by recognizing, on certain conditions, the hereditary rule of the Khedive over the line of Somali coast, where it was already de facto established; and it appeared to His Lordship that the two matters could and ought to be dealt with separately,—that is to say, that General Stanton should proceed with the arrangement for the recognition of the Khedive’s rule over the Somali coast, leaving the question of the English islands and the French claim to Obokh to be dealt with separately, should the Khedive be able to come to an understanding with the French upon it. In expressing the above opinion to this Office,f Lord Tenterden stated that, if the Marquis of Salisbury concurred in it, a further instruction would be addressed to General Stanton, explaining to him the intentions of Her Majesty’s Government, and directing him to propose the arrangement with A2 regard to the Somali coast for the Khedive’s ac ceptance, and to intimate that, if His Highness agreed to it, an application would he made to the Porte to authorize the conclusion of a Convention to give effect to it, and to engage that no portion of the Somali coast thus formerly incorporated in the Ottoman dominions should at any time be ceded to a foreign Power. As to the expediency of the course proposed there could he little doubt. An early settlement of the main issue was desirable on many grounds ; whereas the question of the islands and of Obokh was really of very subordinate importance. Mussa, Bab, and Aubad, though ceded to us in 1840 by the Sheikhs of Zeyla and Tajourrah, had never been occupied; while Obokh had been abandoned by the French since 1863.* It was, moreover, quite certain that discussion of the point was more likely to lead to a reoccupation of Obokh than to relin quishment of the French claim, doubtful as were its merits. In fact, in December 1875 General Stanton was inf rmedf by Nubar Pasha that the Acting Agent and Consul General of Prance had recently addressed a Note to the Egyptian Government, calling their attention to the fact that Ohokh was a French possession, and that, although no establish ment of any sort as yet existed there, the French Government claimed sovereignty over that spot, and could not allow of any interference with their rights on the part of the Egyptian authorities; and a month later Raschid Pasha mentioned to Sir H. Elliot,^ without his having in any way alluded to the subject, that the French Ambassador had intimated to him that his Government maintained their claim to Obokh. Accordingly, the Foreign Office was informed§ that Lord Salisbury agreed with Lord Derby in thinking it desirable that General Stanton should proceed at once with the arrangements for the re cognition, on the conditions before specified, of the hereditary rule of the Khedive of Egypt over the line of Somali coast up to Cape Guardafui, where it was already de facto established, and that the question of English rights over the islands of Mussa, Bah, and Aubad, and of French claims to Obokh, should be dealt with separately when circumstances permitted. It was added:— “ Lord Salisbury presumes that it is not intended to recognize the incorporation in the Ottoman dominions, under the rule of the Khedive, of any part of the Somali coast south of Cape Guardafui, and that Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt will he furnished with instructions for his guidance in the event, which from recent correspondence seems not improbable, of the Khedive objecting to regard that point as the limit of his dominions.” Instructions in this sense were issued to General Stanton, || who was desired to intimate to the Khedive that, if His Highness agreed to the con ditions proposed by Her Majesty’s Government, an * Memorandum, 26th February 1876, p. 17. f Despatch, No. 162, dated 11th December 1875. t Despatch, No. 91, dated 24th January- 1876. § 11th Mareh 1876, No. 118. | Despatch, No. 74, dated 22nd March 1876.3 * From Foreign Office, 27th April 1876, No. 252. f From Foreign Office, 22nd July 1876, No. 440. J From Foreign Office, 30th September 1876, No. 555. application would be made to the Porte to authorize the conclusion of a Convention to give effect to it, and to engage that no portion of the Somali coast thus formally incorporated in the Ottoman do minions under the rule of the Khedive should at any time be ceded to a foreign Power. On the 7th April 1876,* General Stanton re ported that he had made the necessary communi cation to the Egyptian Government, and had had a casual conversation with the Khedive on the subject. His Highness remarked, with reference to Cape Guardafui being regarded as the limit of his pos sessions on the Somali coast, that Has Haffun, a point some 200 (sic, but ?) miles south of the cape, and to which neither Zanzibar nor any other Power even laid claim, was actually occupied by him ; and that the Egyptian Government had been fully recognized there by the local Chiefs and tribes. He was ready to agree to most of the conditions proposed by Her Majesty’s Government, but ob served, with regard to Zeyla, that he was unable to declare that a free port, as he had to pay the Porte the sum of 15,000/. a year in lieu of the customs dues formerly collected there on account of the Ottoman Government. His Highness was willing to enter into any en gagement with Her Majesty’s Government for the prohibition of the export of slaves along the coast, and for the prevention of the slave trade in Egyptian waters; but with regard to the suppression of the slave trade in the Somali territory, it was out of his power to take any effective steps in that direction, unless the whole of the territory as far as the J uba was incorporated under his rule, and he again alluded to the necessity of his being allowed a proper harbour on the north-east coast of Africa. General Stanton, with reference to this last point, suggested whether it might not be advisable to consider the question of the boundary between Egypt and Zanzibar at the same time as that of the incorporation with Egypt of the coast as far as Cape Guardafui. On the 9th June, Lord Derby, in forwarding to Mr. Cookson, who was acting as Consul General in Egypt, a report by the Commander of Her Majesty’s ship “ Teazer ” of a cruise to Tajourrah, Zeyla, and Berbera, showing great activity of the Egyptian authorities at these places, requested to be informed how the question of the recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over the Somali coast then stood. Mr. Cookson’s reply (No. 224, dated 1st July 1876),f did not contain the information desired. Subsequently (No. 237, dated 8th August ]876),J he reported, as follows, what passed at an interview with the Khedive on the 6th August:— “ His Highness repeated his desire to enter into the proposed Convention, but objected to Cape Guardafui as the limit of Egyptian territory, ob serving that, as a matter of fact, Egypt had acquired4 sovereignty over the whole Somali country, of which the natural south is the river Juba, by the^ sub mission of the various tribes and the occupation of the principal town, Harrar. “ In reply, I pointed out to His Highness that Brava and Kismayo, which are north of the Juba, being claimed as possessions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, I did not know that Her Majesty’s Go vernment would undertake the responsibility of deciding this territorial dispute in favour of one of the parties without the consent of the other. “ To this His Highness replied that it was solely in consequence of the remonstrances which had been addressed to him in December last on the occasion of the occupation of Brava by Egyptian troops, that he had consented to withdraw from the occupation of that port, and that therefore he thought the re sponsibility to which I had referred had already been incurred by Her Majesty’s Government. . . . “ The Khedive then proceeded to notice the several conditions of recognition which I had men tioned as laid down by Her Majesty’s Government. Eirst, as to the engagement never to cede any part of the territory to be recognized as Egyptian to any foreign Power, His Highness declared himself perfectly willing, as far as His Highness’s Govern ment was concerned, to agree to this, being assured that no Power could ever have interests in those countries as closely allied to those of Egypt as Great Britain has. Secondly, as to the keeping free and open the ports on those coasts, His Highness said there would be no difficulty in engaging not to close them, but that (as pointed out in General Stanton’s despatch, No. 127, of 7th April last) he has to pay 15,000/. annually to the Porte in lieu of customs formerly collected at Zeyla, and therefore he could not undertake to declare that port entirely free. In speaking afterwards on this subject to Cherif Pasha he told me that the Egyptian Govern ment would be ready to make this declaration as to Berbera and Bulhar, which are the chief sources of supply for the provisioning of Aden; but that he hoped the present custom-house arrangements at the other ports of Zeyla and Tajourrah might be allowed to remain undisturbed. Thirdly, as to the slave trade and piracy, His Highness said that he hoped it was unnecessary to say that he was ready to agree to do everything in his power to co-operate towards their suppression, but that the Egyptian Government could not afford to assume the respon sibility of effecting this, unless the power were allowed them of stopping one of its chief outlets at Brava beyond Cape Guardafui, where the nominal authority of the Sultan of Zanzibar was, even if honestly exerted, quite powerless for that purpose. “ His Highness then referred to the sacrifices which he had made in this cause, and repeated what he had said on previous occasions (and particularly in the conversation reported by General Stanton in his despatch, Slave Trade, No. 2, of 9th January last), as to the importance which General Gordon attached5 to having a port on the east of Africa, not only for opening and developing the commerce of the lake districts, but for effectually checking the export of slaves. “ Cherif Pasha, having been summoned by the Khedive to attend, was present at the greater part of this conversation, and subsequently, on the same day, I pursued the subject with him. Among other things, he observed generally on the whole question that the conditions on which Her Ma jesty’s Government proposed to recognize Egyptian sovereignty as far as Cape Guardafui were, he thought, sufficiently onerous to justify the Govern ment of the Khedive in asking as an equivalent that the boundary should be extended to the river Juba, as far as Her Majesty’s Government are in a position to fix that limit. “On the whole, I think I am justified in ex- pressing a confident hope that, if this concession can be made consistently with the general policy of Her Majesty’s Government in this part of Africa, there w ill not be much difficulty in arranging other points in accordance with the views entertained by your Lordship.” J * From Foreign Office, 27th October 1876, No. 612. t To Foreign Office, 13th November 1876, No. 612. On the 15th October 1876, Mr. Vivian, who had just been appointed to the post of Agent and Consul General in Egypt, reported (Despatch, No. 145)* an unofficial conversation with Cherif Pasha, in which the Egyptian Minister for Eoreign Affairs again expressed himself much in the above sense. These despatches from Mr. Cookson and Mr. Vivian were communicated by the Eoreign Office to this Office without remark. They indicated, however, considerable risk that the comparatively simple question of Egyptian rights over the Somali coast up to Guardafui would become complicated v ith the more difficult one of an extension of those lights south of that point along the cast coast of Africa as far as the Zanzibar boundary. The first question from an Indian point of view was of real importance, and urgent; in the second, India had no great interest; if Egypt and Zanzibar could come to terms upon it, neither Indian nor Imperial interests would be likely to be adversely affected, and the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government might very well be offered to effect a solution agreeable to both parties; but it seemed very inex pedient that the Somali coast settlement should remain in abeyance pending such solution. Accordingly, receipt of the papers was acknow r - ledged, with the following remarks :—f ^ “ Jp rd Salisbury gathers from these papers that the Khedive is willing to assent to all the condi tions which Her Majesty’s Government have attached to their recognition of the incorporation of the Somali coast in the Ottoman dominions under the rule of His Highness, with the exception of the one requiring that Zeyla and Tajourrah shall be deciared free ports; but that it will be found difficult to induce His Highness to accept Cape 11516. bm 6 Guardafui as the limit of his dominions along the African coast. “It is for Lord Derby to consider whether the condition in regard to Zeyla and Tajourrah should be insisted upon. So far as Indian interests are con cerned, Lord Salisbury is disposed to think that, provided Bulhar and Berbera, which are the chief sources of supply to Aden, be declared free ports, it will be sufficient to require that the advantages conceded at Zeyla and Tajourrah to British subjects under the Indian treaties with the ruling Chiefs of those places shall in no case be restricted. “ As regards the limitation of the Khedive’s jurisdiction along the coast to Cape Guardafui, Lord Salisbury is of opinion that it might be inex pedient to formally recognize such jurisdiction along any part of the coast south of that point, until the northern limit of the possessions of the Sultan of Zanzibar has been definitively fixed. “ Although the political interest of the British Government in the east coast of Africa is small in comparison with that which it lias in the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden, it could not either sanction, or be indifferent to, encroachments by the Buler of Egypt on the territories of Zanzibar. If, therefore, the dominions of the Khedive arc to be recognized as extending soutli of Guardafui, it will be necessary that the boundary in that direction between Egypt and Zanzibar should first be deter mined. “ Lord Salisbury, however, considers it undesir able that recognition of the Khedive’s sovereignty as far as Guardafui should be delayed pending the negotiations which would obviously be necessary, and would probably be lengthy, before any agree ment would be likely to be arrived at between Egypt and Zanzibar in reference to the limit of their respective possessions along the coast. “ His Lordship desires, therefore, to suggest, for Lord Derby’s consideration, that the two questions should be treated as entirely distinct, and that Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Egypt should be in structed to press this view of the case upon the Khedive. If it were intimated to His Highness that, in regarding, for the purposes of the present negotiation, Cape Guardafui as the limit of his dominions along the African coast under the suze rainty of the Porte, Her Majesty’s Government do not desire to be considered as opposed to an exten sion of those possessions to the south, provided that such extension involve no aggression on Zanzibar, but that, on the contrary, they w r ould be willing hereafter to recognize any amicable arrangement which may be come to between His Highness and the Sultan of Zanzibar, and to give, if re quested, any assistance in their power to effect such an arrangement, it seems to Lord Salisbury very possible that the Khedive would no longer insist upon his objections, and that, assuming that difficulties are not likely to be raised at Constanti-7 * From Foreign Office, 25th November 1876, No. 661. ■(■ From Foreign Office, 16th December 1876, No. 704. J Despatch from Mr. Vivian, No. 43, dated 2nd December 1876. § To Foreign Office, 27th January 1877, No. 704. Lord Salisbury’s views being concurred in by' Lord Derby,* instructions, in accordance with them, were sent (24th November 1876, No. 185) to Mr. Vivian, who, however, found the Khedive unwilling to enter into the arrangement suggested,f which His Highness, in conversation on the 2nd December, said might involve him in responsibi lities for the suppression of the slave trade, without any corresponding advantages to Egypt. What he really wanted was a port on the east coast, some where near the river Juba. As Her Majesty’s Government thought that this could not be con ceded to him until the rights of Zanzibar were ascertained, he was ready to wait until this was done, and he would gladly profit by the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government to this end. Mean while, however, he was quite ready to give a formal assurance that Berbera and Bulbar should be free and open ports, without restrictions or dues of any kind beyond a charge at the former port for the use of the new r quays, which he undertook should not exceed the same charges at Aden, and that at the other ports along the coast the custom dues should in no case exceed the treaty limit of 8 per cent.J The attitude assumed by the Khedive made the position somewhat embarrassing, and threatened to bring the negotiations to a dead lock. The alter natives seemed to be, (1) to let the whole question drop, or (2) to accept the Khedive’s proposal and attempt to settle the Zanzibar boundary at once, or (3) to press the original proposition upon the Khedive, with an intimation that, if it was not accepted by His Highness, Her Majesty’s Govern ment would be compelled to continue to regard as independent tbe Somali tribes with whom we had treaty relations. Lord Derby having asked for the opinion of the Secretary of State for India in the matter, the view ultimately taken by Lord Salisbury was com municated to the Foreign Office in the following terms :—§ “ Lord Salisbury learns from Mr. Vivian’s De spatch, that while the Khedive is willing to give satisfactory assurances in regard to trade at Bulhar, Berbera, and other ports along the coast, His Highness is indisposed to accept, even temporarily, Cape Guardafui as the recognized limit of his dominions in that direction, and wishes apparently to delay the execution of any Convention on the subject until, through the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government, the question of the northern boundary of Zanzibar shall have been settled in a manner consonant to His Highness’s wishes, in view to a further extension of his jurisdiction down along the east coast of Africa. “ In Lord Salisbury’s opinion, it would be inex pedient for Her Majesty’s Government to accede to what appear to be the Khedive’s wishes in this matter, or to take any steps whatever in regard to8 the Zanzibar boundary, until His Highness’s juris diction over the Somali coast, under the suzerainty of the Porte, has been formally recognized. “ His Lordship would suggest, for Lord Derby’s consideration, that Mr. Vivian should be instructed to explain to the Khedive, that the offer by Her Majesty’s Government of their good offices, in order to effect an amicable arrangement between His Highness and the Sultan of Zanzibar, was entirely conditional on the previous acceptance by the Khedive of the stipulations in respect to the Somali coast, which were communicated to the Egyptian Government by General Stanton in April last, and on their embodiment in a formal Convention, after the necessary action at Constantinople, subject to certain modifications as regards the levy of customs duties at Zeyla and Tajourrah, and that until His Highness’s jurisdiction up to Guardafui shall have been thus formally recognized, Her Majesty’s Go vernment are not in a position, and cannot consent, to take any step which might lead to an extension of that jurisdiction soutliwards. “ Mr. Vivian might also be instructed to intimate to the Khedive that Her Majesty’s Government observe with regret His Highness’s unwillingness to accede to the course which has been suggested as most likely to lead to an early and satisfactory settlement of the question, and that should His Highness continue to refuse his assent to the con ditions which Her Majesty’s Government have at tached to their acquiescence in the formal incorpo ration in his dominions of territory occupied by tribes with which the British Government has treaty relations of long standing, and which it has never ceased to regard as independent, Her Ma jesty’s Government will have no alternative but to abandon the project of recognizing by a diplomatic instrument the actual position of affairs along the coast as far as Guardafui, and to reserve to them selves perfect freedom of action towards the tribes in question. “It is for Lord Derby’s consideration whether Mr. Vivian should be instructed to notice the Khedive’s observation in regard to the responsi bilities in respect to the slave trade, which would attach to him under the proposed Convention, and from which His Highness appears to consider that he would be relieved, should such Convention not be concluded. Lord Salisbury apprehends that, even should the negotiations be broken off, Her Majesty’s Government would equally expect the Khedive to adopt measures for the suppression of the slave trade at Zeyla and other ports in actual possession of His Highness, and failing such measures, would take the matter into their own hands, as though the tribes concerned had not been subjected to Egyptian authority.” With the exception of the last paragraph, the foregoing letter was embodied in a despatch. (No. 10), which was addressed by Lord Derby to Mr. Vivian, on the 8th February 1877.9 Intermediately a question had been raised by' Her Majesty’s Consul General, and referred from the Foreign Office to this Office, on the subject of the form in which the assurance proposed to be given by the Khedive in regard to trade at Berbera * From Foreign Office, 23rd December and Bulbar should be given.* 1876, No. 726; also 10th January 1877, point, however, was obviously one which °‘ ' could not be satisfactorily dealt with until it was known whether the Khedive abandoned or main tained the attitude which he had assumed on the general question, and whether the negotiations were to proceed or to be suspended. In the former case the stipulations affecting trade at Bulhar, Berbera, and other ports along the coast, would, no doubt, be embodied in the Convention which would then be executed ; while, in the opposite contingency, the measures that might be necessary to main tain unimpaired the privileges secured to British trade by the Indian treaties with the several tribes concerned would be matter for consideration. N(t To Foreign Office, 13th February 1877, Accordingly,! in replying to the Foreign Office, the opportunity was taken to notice the reference made by the Khedive, in his conversation with Mr. Vivian on the 2nd December, to the levy of a duty of 8 per cent, at the ports along the coast other than Bulhar and Berbera, and to suggest to Lord Derby that Her Majesty’s Consul-General should be reminded that, under the Indian treaties of 1840 with the Chiefs of Zeyla and Tajourrah, the rate of duty leviable at those places was limited to 5 per cent., and that it should be intimated to him that Her Majesty’s Government would not be disposed to acquiesce in the levy by the Khedive of a higher rate. No I67 m Foreisn 22n(i March 1877 &gt; To this limitation His Highness eventually agreed. J In obedience to his instructions, Mr. Vivian § From Foreign Office, 2nd March 1877, (Despatch, No. 41, dated 21st February 1877),§ once No - 133 - more urged upon the Khedive the absolute neces sity of settling the question of the recognition of his jurisdiction, under the suzerainty of the Porte, ‘ over the Somali coast, as far as Cape Guardafui. His Highness again expressed strong, and, as Mr. Vivian believed, conscientious objections, to con tract an engagement (which it might be beyond his power to fulhl) to suppress all slave trade, and prevent the export of slaves along the line of coast between Berbera and Cape Guardafui, where, he said, no ports existed, and where his authority could not be regularly established until he had a port on the east coast; but on Her Majesty’s Consul General saying that, in that case, he was instructed to tell him that Her Majesty’s Govern ment must revert to their right of dealing inde pendently with the tribes with which they had already treaty relations of long standing, His Highness, after some hesitation, yielded, and agreed to execute a Convention defining Cape Guardafui as the limits of his jurisdiction upon the following bases: — 1. Bulhar and Berbera to be declared free ports, at which no monopolies or impediments of any sort to trade should be permitted. 11516. CMl 4f% 10 2. The Customs dues at Zeyla, Tajourrah, and the other ports along the coast not to exceed the treaty limits, and England to have a right to claim the treatment of the most favoured nation. 3. The Khedive to engage for himself and his successors that no portion of the territory thus formally incorporated in the Ottoman dominions under his hereditary rule should ever be ceded to any foreign power. 4. Her Majesty’s Government to have the right to station British Consular Agents at any port or ports along the coast. 5. With respect to the slave trade and the police of the seas, His Highness would undertake to prohibit all export of slaves, to suppress the traffic, and to render himself responsible for maintaining order as far south as Ber- bera ; but between Berbera and Cape Guar- dafui he could only pledge himself for the present, and until such time as his authority could be regularly established along this line of coast, to use every endeavour within the means at his disposal to suppress the slave trade and maintain order. In return, the Khedive expressed a hope that Her Majesty’s Government would give him a written promise to use their good offices to settle the question of the frontier between Egypt and Zanzibar. His Highness agreed to Mr. Vivian’s suggestion that Her Majesty’s Government should prepare a draft Convention in the above sense, which he would be prepared to sign ; but he remarked that the proposed arrangement could not, of course, affect the claim of the Erench to Obokh, of which be could not dispossess them. In expressing to Lord Derby his satisfaction at this favourable turn of events, Lord Salisbury* suggested that no time should be lost in taking at Cairo and Constantinople such steps as might be necessary to give effect to the arrangement which bad been agreed to. On the 4th March (Despatch No. 47,t) Mr. Vivian reported that the Khedive had begged that he would submit to Her Majesty’s Government his request that the recognized limit of his jurisdiction might be extended to a point called Ras-Hafoun, about 80 miles to the south of Cape Guardafui. At this point there was a sheltered bay, where he could form a post to control the coast line between Guardafui and Berbera. As tins point was clearly beyond the frontier of Zanzibar, His Highness trusted that Her Majesty’s Government would raise no objection to this slight extension of the limit they had laid down, as it would greatly facilitate the measures be might have to take for the surveil lance of the coast. The question was referred from the Eoreign Office both to the Secretary of State for India and to the Hydrographer to the Admiralty.

Salisbury* saw no objection to the extension as far as Ras-Hafoun which was desired by the Khe dive. The Hydrographer recommendedf that, for convenience sake, the Egyptian jurisdiction should be defined as being in the 10th parallel of north latitude, which would give some 25 miles of sea room south of the promontory of Ras-IIafoun. Erom the definition thus proposed, Lord Salisbury, on a further reference, saw no reason to dissent.J It was not, however, eventually emborlied in the Convention. On the 13th June 1877,§ the Foreign Office for warded, for Lord Salisbury’s concurrence, drafts of the proposed Convention, and of a despatch trans mitting it to Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt. The Convention was framed in accordance with the basis previously agreed upon, except that (1) Ras-Hafoun was substituted for Cape Guardafui as the extreme eastern point of the Khedive’s juris diction ; (2) words were introduced securing to Her Majesty’s Consuls on the coast the same privi leges, exemptions, and immunities which were or might be hereafter conceded to the Consular Agents of the most favoured nations; and (3) a paragraph was added with the view to enable British cruisers to act for the suppression of the slave trade in the waters on the Somali coast, which, when the agree ment came into force, would be considered as Egyptian. Mr. Vivian was instructed, in submitting the agreement, to state to Cherif Pasha, that Her Majesty’s Government would take the earliest op portunity of intimating to the Porte that they were prepared to recognize the jurisdiction of the Khedive over the coast in question, as soon as the steps mentioned in Article V. of the draft had been taken by the Sultan. That Article was worded as follows :— (] Tho words in italics were eventually omittad. “ The present agreement shall come into opera tion as soon as His Imperial Majesty the Sultan shall have taken the necessary steps for placing the territory in question under the hereditary adminis tration of His Highness the Khedive of Egypt, and shall have\\ given an assurance to Her Majesty’s Government that no foreign Power shall be per mitted to hold or acquire any territory on the said coast.” f To Foreign Office, 21st June 1877, N®. 398. The terms both of the Convention and the in structions to Mr. Vivian were concurred in bv Lord Salisbury, The draft was returned by Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt on the 4th August (Despatch No. 246), modified in some points by himself and the Egyptian Government. Only three of the changes w^ere of any importance. In regard to them Mr. Vivian explained :— “ In Article I., I have clearly stipulated that at Tajour rah and Zeyla, and all the ports on the Somali coast, other than Bulhar and Berbera (which12 are free ports), the customs dues shall not exceed five per cent, on imports and one per cent, on exports. The Article, as it was worded, might have allowed the Egyptian Government to charge the maximum five per cent, duty upon exports as well as upon imports. “ In Article III., the Egyptian Government desire to insert a clause providing against the ap pointment, as British Consular Agents along the Somali coast, of natives of Egypt, or of the neigh bouring countries, such as the Somalis and Abys- sinians, to which the Khedive would entertain strong objections. “ The Khedive takes exception to the stipulation in Article V., that a special grant from the Sultan must he obtained for the incorporation of the Somali territory with Egypt, as he fears it might weaken his title to other countries, such as the Soudan and Darfour, which he has recently an nexed ; lie also objects to the special exception of the Somali coast as territory that the Sultan may not alienate from his rule, as implying that other portions of Egypt may he so alienated. He therefore proposes to modify the Article in the sense of his views.” In this despatch, and in a subsequent one dated the 17th August (No. 264),* Mr. Vivian urged the importance of an early settlement of the matter, and in the later document expressed his anxiety that no time should be lost in carrying out the Khedives laudable decision to erect a lighthouse at Cape Has Hafoun, of which the plans were ready, and which His Highness proposed to name after Her Majesty’s Consul General, by whom the work had been suggested. The modifications proposed in the Convention were considered unobjectionable both by Lord Herbyf and Lord Salisbury.^ The Secretary of State for India, however, in so writing to the Foreign Office, added an expression of his opinion that the assurance to be given by the Porte referred to in Article V. (marginally noted),§ should be ob tained with the least possible delay. Meanwhile, the necessary instructions having been sent to Her Majesty’s Consul General, the Convention was signed at Alexandria, on the 7th September 1877, by Mr. Vivian and Cherif Pasha. || The text is printed in French and English as an Appendix to this Memorandum. So far as the English and Egyptian Governments were concerned, the question was thus settled; but pending the assurance from the Sultan, required by Article V., the Convention remained diploma tically invalid. At the moment, no action could be taken at Constantinople in the matter, the attention of the Sultan’s Government being, naturally, absorbed in the struggle with Bussia then in progress. The inconvenience of this suspense was first illustrated by a telegram from the Resident at Aden * From Foreign Office, 27th August 1877, No. 621. f From Foreign Office, 23rd August 1877, No. 614. J To Foreign Office, 20th August 1877. § Article V. The present Agreement shall definitively come into operation as soon as His Imperial Majesty the Sultan shall have given a formal assurance to Her Majesty’s Government that no portion of the territory of the Somali coast,—a territory which, together with all other countries incorporated with Egypt and forming an integral part of the Empire, shall be recognized by His Imperial Majesty as a dependency of Egypt,—shall more than any other portion of Egypt, or of the coun tries placed under His Highness’ hereditary rule, be ceded on any pretence whatever to any Foreign Power. || From Foreign Office, 21st September 1877, No. 674.14 &lt;£ and 1857, with the Hahr Owul tribe. This con- * dition is vital to the interests of Aden, which is “ mainly dependent upon Berbera for supplies, and &lt;c Lord Cranbrook could not acquiesce in any “ modification of it.” This correspondence was forwarded to the Go vernment of India,* who, after an interval, replied,f expressing entire agreement in the view above set forth, which also had the concurrence of the Resi dent at Aden (General Loch) and the Government of Bombay. They forwarded, at the same time, various letters from the Resident complaining (11th February 1879) of “ innovations in the matter of “ taxes, &amp;c., levied at the free port of Berbera :(23rd March 1879) of “ fresh impositions in the “ way of duties imposed at Berbera by the Egyptian “authorities;” and (16th April 1879) of “the “ enormous dues and taxes now being levied at “ Berbera.” In his letter of the 16th April 1879, General Loch renewed a previous suggestion that a resident merchant should be appointed British Agent at Berbera, as a means of putting a check on further imposts being made; he observed, at the same time, on the general question :— “ Under the Convention entered into between Great Britain and the Turkish Government, Berbera and Bulhar are to remain free ports so long as Aden remains a free port; and, consequently, all the taxes and dues lately imposed arc in contravention of the Agreement; and I would suggest the ne cessity that exists for this matter being brought to the notice of the Turkish Government, with a view to the present taxes levied at these two ports being abolished, and for instructions being issued by that Government to the effect that no taxes or dues are to be levied so long as Aden remains a free port; and when any taxes or dues are to be imposed, then only with the Sultan’s knowledge and consent.” In sending home these papers, the Government of India, J remarked that they were not aware of any provision either in the Somali Coast Conven tion, or in any other compact, whereby the main tenance of Berbera as a free port was conditional upon Aden remaining free. They intimated at the same time that they had no objection to the nomi nation of an honorary British Agent at Berbera. Intermediately (26th May 1879) the Bombay Government had sanctioned the appointment of Mr. Murjan Safee to that post, an arrangement which, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,§ has been approved by Lord Cranbrook, upon the understanding that the duties of the Agent will be restricted to furnishing information. || It was not till the 10th October 1878, that it was deemed advisable to take any steps at Constan tinople in the matter of the Convention of 7th September 1877. Lord Salisbury then (Despatch, * Secret, No. 32, dated 22nd August 1878. t Secret, No. 143, dated 15th June 1879. f Secret, No. 143, dated 16th June 1879. § From Foreign Office, 25th August 1879, No. 642. || To India, Secret, No. 33, dated 11th September 1879. 18 N&lt; be15 (z&lt;3) * From Foreign Office, 16th November 1878, No. 794. &gt; I From Sir H.

Layard a copy of that document, with the following remarks :— “At the time when this Convention was signed, the attention of the Sultan’s Ministers was so much occupied with questions of the gravest importance to the Empire, that it seemed undesirable to bring this matter before the Porte. Now, however, that circumstances have become less critical, Her Ma jesty’s Government are desirous of making the Turkish Government acquainted with the agree ment entered into with the Khedive, and of pro curing the declaration from the Sultan on which its operation depends. “You are accordingly requested to take a suitable opportunity to communicate the Convention to the Grand Vizier, and to enter into negotiations with him for the formal delivery of a declaration to the effect specified. “Her Majesty’s Government have no reason to suppose that any difficulty will be made by the Porte, or that they will view otherwise than with satisfaction an arrangement which has been drawn up in a sense favourable to the authority of the Sultan and his tributary. “ In view of the necessity of obtaining supplies for the British station at Aden, it is of importance to Her Majesty’s Government that the ports on the opposite coast should be in the hands of a friendly Power, able to keep the native tribes under proper control, and willing to allow unrestricted inter course for British trade. These considerations, and the desire to see the slave trade, which still prevails in those waters, effectively suppressed, are the principal motives which have actuated Her Ma jesty’s Government in concluding the Convention, and they believe they can count upon the co operation of the Porte for carrying it into effect.” In obedience to the above instructions, Sir H. Layard communicated a copy of the Convention to the Grand Vizier by an official note.j* Consequent upon a despatch from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Rome (No. 92, dated 29th October 1878), indicating that the Italian Govern ment was likely to endeavour to obtain a footing on the Somali coast by means of negotiations with the Chiefs of Abyssinia, Lord Salisbury addressed Sir II. Layard, as follow r s :—| “ I transmit herewith to your Excellency copy of a despatch from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Rome relative to projects for the extension of Italian commerce to the interior of Africa. Your Excellency will observe that the acquisition of an establishment on the coast of the Red Sea is con templated as a portion of the enterprise. “ It would be desirable that the Convention con cluded between Her Majesty’s Government and the Khedive in regard to the Somali coast should be made operative as soon as possible, in order to settle clearly the question of territorial jurisdiction and commercial privileges on that coast, and with this16 view your Excellency is requested to endeavour to obtain, without loss of time, the declaration from the Sultan required by the Convention, in accord ance with the instructions contained in my de spatch, No. 1224, of the 10th ultimo.” Her Majesty’s Ambassador accordingly again pressed the Grand Vizier on the subject. His Highness stated, however, that he could not well answer Sir H. Layard’s note until he had heard from the Khedive himself, who had as yet made no no communication to the Porte with respect to the Convention. Safvet Pasha promised to telegraph at once to the Khedive, and to give an answer as soon as he received a reply.* The question now again slept for a time. But it was revived by some proceedings of the Resident at Aden, consequent on the wreck (in December 1878) of the steamer “ Vortigem,” on the coast occupied by the Mijjerteyn Somalis. These people are divided into several tribes under one nominal Chief, Sultan Othman Mahomed, whose capital is Bunder Marayeh. Their territory extends from about E. longitude 49° as far as Cape Guardafui, and southwards from that promon tory to Ras-ul-Khyle in about 8° N. latitude. The part of the Mijjerteyn coast most dangerous to navigation, and upon which the “ Vortigern ” was stranded, is in possession of Sultan Yusuf Ali of Alhlah, a cousin and feudatory of Sultan Othman. This Chief, in February 1879, was at Aden, with reference to his claims in connection with salvage of the “ Vortigern.” In writing on the subject to the Government of Bombay (24th February 1879), General Loch observed :—“ Viewing the present as a favourable “ opportunity for effecting some binding agree- “ ment with the Mijjerteyn, I considered that to arrange the matter of the ‘ Vortigem ’ is but an “ occasion to fix a limit to the former unsettled “ and indefinite action on the part of these Somalis “ in the matter of wrecks on their coasts ; I there- “ fore contemplate, in adjusting this matter, to “ arrange for the execution of some definite agree- “ ment by means of which wholesale plunder and “ loss may be averted. “ My idea is to have an agreement drawn up and “ signed by these Somalis; but, on considering the “ matter, it has occurred to me that some objection “ might exist on the score of suzerainty, which we “ have admitted as an existing right of the Turco- “ Egyptian Government over this territory. “ I have ascertained from the Alulah Chief (a “ close branch of Hafoun), as well as from a rela- “ five of the Hafoun Chief, the Sultan of the “ Mijjerteyn, who has come to visit me, that, up to “ the present time, no assumption of rights and no “ formal proceedings have, in any way, been “ entered upon at Hafoun by the Egyptian Go- “ vernment, and that Government is undoubtedly “ unrepresented.” * From Sir H. Layard, No. 1497, dated 4th December 1878.17 “ Such being the c^se, in spite of our admission “ of Egyptian jurisdiction, it appears to me but “ legitimate, and not contrary to international “ etiquette, that we should, subject to ratification “ by Turkey, be perfectly justified in entering into “ an agreement of the nature I propose, to guard “ not only our own interests, but those of the “ universal and mercantile public trading and “ travelling in these seas. “ Such agreement would further assume the “ character, under the circumstances, of tending to “ coerce Egypt to make some move for the general “ good, which, at present, she would appear loth “ to do ; and, on these grounds also, would appear “ politic.” To Foreign Office, 10th April 1879. In forwarding this letter to the Eoreign Office,* Sir L. Mallet stated that, in Lord Cranbrook’s opinion, the attention of Lord Salisbury should be specially invited to Brigadier-General Loch’s state ment that, up to the present time, no assumption of rights and no formal proceedings had in any way been entered on at Hafoun by the Egyptian Government. No t * 2 r 9 om Folei « n 0fflcc - 3rd l879 &gt; Sir J. Pauncefote replied as follows f “ Lord Salisbury desires me to observe that, as far as this Department is concerned, the only question which appears to His Lordship to call for any observation is that which relates to the proposal that we should enter into an agreement with the ~ yj Sultan Alulah, Chief of the Mijjerteyn Somalis, for the protection of the lives and properties of British subjects wrecked on bis coast. “ Under ordinary circumstances, I am to observe that this would, of course, be an advisable step to take, and the only objection to pursuing such a course on the present occasion would appear to be the fact that Her Majesty’s Government have entered into an agreement with the Egyptian Go vernment by which European jurisdiction is acknow ledged on the African coast as far south as Has Hatbun, and we could not, therefore, consistently enter into treaty engagements with the Chief Alulah in regard to territories the sovereignty over ■which we have already acknowledged as being vested in the Khedive. It is true that the assent of the Porte has not yet been given to the Conven tion by which we have acknowledged Egyptian jurisdiction as extending to Has Hafoun, and the Egyptian authorities have not yet taken any steps to assert their authority over the coast in question; but as the principal object of Her Majesty’s Go vernment in acknowledging Egyptian jurisdiction over the coast as far as Ras Hafoun is to prevent any other foreign Power from forming establish ments there, and as a stipulation to that effect is inserted in the Convention with Egypt, it would, in the opinion of Lord Salisbury, be extremely un- ad visable on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to do anything which could throw any doubts on Egyptian rights to the coast, and to enter into a» 11516. E18 treaty with an independent Chief, or a Chief claim ing to be independent, whose territories are situated within the limits acknowledged as Egyptian, might have that effect, and the example might be fol lowed by other Powers, who might endeavour to induce the Chief to cede to them a portion of his territories. “ It is possible, however, that the fact that Sultan Alulah is the acknowledged Chief of territory south of Ras Hafoun, which is beyond Egyptian jurisdic- tinn, as well as of territory north of that cape which is within the limits we have acknowledged as Egyptian, might justify our making an agreement with him quoad his territory beyond Egyptian jurisdiction, with an understanding that, until the -^§&gt;ypti an 9 occupy the coast, it shall extend to his territory north of Ras Hafoun. I am to add that, should such an agreement be negotiated with the Chief of the Mijjerteyn Somalis, Lord Salisbury would suggest that it should be submitted to this Department for approval before it is signed.” Meanwhile, however, General Loch had acted. After some rather inconclusive telegraphic cor respondence with the Bombay Government, he directed his Assistant, Major Goodfellow, to return to the Mijjerteyn coast with the Alulah Chief, and, amongst other business, to settle with him an agreement in the sense already indicated.* # From Resident to Government of T , . . . .. , Bombay, 13th March 1879. In his instructions to Major Goodfellow, General Loch stated:— “In making this agreement it must not be lost sight ot that, although the Mijjerteyn Somalis themselves at present refuse to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Egyptian Government over any portion of the Somali littoral, as they are perfectly ignorant of that portion of the African coast having come under the Khedive’s Government, the British Government have, nevertheless, entered into a Convention with the Khedive recognizing his suzerainty over the Somali coast as far south as Ras Hafoun. In making any treaty, therefore, it must be made provisionally only, that is, subject to the British Government ratifying the same, and that the terms of the agreement, or the payment of any stipend arranged on, will not come into force, nor be paid, until the agreement is duly ratified,’ and the date from which it is to come into force is fixed by the British Government, and notified to the Mijjerteyn Chiefs. I must ask you to be most par- ticular in impressing this on the Mijjerteyn Chiefs, so that, should Government not ratify the agree ment, no difficulties may arise from the present steps.” 1 One purpose of Major Goodfellow’s mission was to settle eeitain internal feuds betv r een the Mii jerteyn Chiefs. In this he failed; but he never theless succeeded in his main object, which was19 the conclusion of an agreement between them and the British Government. That agreement, dated 31st March 1879, was in the following terms :— “ Influenced by motives of friendship, and with a desire to conform to the principles on which the great British Government is conducted, and wishing to preserve peace and to foster security on our shores, We, the Chiefs of the Mijjerteyn Somali, Othman Mahmood, Sultan of the Mijjerteyn tribe, Noor Othman, Ismael Othman, Samuntur Othman, Ali Othman, Yousuf Ali, Mahomed Shermaki, Jama Sherwa, elders, on behalf of ourselves, our heirs and successors, do hereby covenant and agree with our friend, Major George Goodfellow, Assistant Resident at Aden, on behalf of the Great British Government:— “1. Tliat in the event of any steamer, or ship, or other vessel, belonging to the British Government, or to a British subject, or to any other Power, or to the subjects of any other Power, being wrecked upon our shores or in distress, that protection should be accorded to her and all on board, and that the latter shall receive good treatment. “ 2. That should the master, crew, or passengers of any wreck or casualty wish to proceed to Aden, we will protect them and conduct them thither, or give them the best means in our power of proceeding there. “ 3. That should any steamer, ship, or vessel be wrecked, suffer casualty, or be abandoned, we will not only protect and guard such steamer, ship, or vessel from plunder and wilful damage to our utmost ability, but we will give speedy notice of such wreck to the Governor of Aden. “ 4. That such steamer, ship, or vessel will be protected by us as aforesaid until instruc tions in reply are given and received from the Governor of Aden to our said notice. “ 5. That should the great Government desire to erect, or be interested in the erection, of any lighthouse or beacon on our shores, we will do our utmost to further the wishes of the great Government, and will protect any lighthouse, beacon, or other such building as may be erected from molestation, and the persons of those occupied in looking after such lighthouse or beacon. “ That for such acts of goodwill and friendship, and as imposing on Us, Our heirs, and suc- ccessors the obligations afore-mentioned, we shall receive from the British Govern ment a yearly stipend of 360 dollars, and we shall also expect to receive such salvage as by any right, according to British law, we may be entitled to, and, according as the great British Government, through their representative, the Governor of Aden for the time being, may, on the merits of each case, determine by the custom in such cases.”20 “ In token of the conclusion of this lawful and honourable bond, Othman Mahmood, Sultan of the Mijjerteyn tribe, Noor Othman, Ismael Othman, Samuntur Othman, Ali Othman, Yousuf Ali, Ma homed Shermaki, Jama Sherwa, elders, on behalf of themselves, their heirs, and successors, and Major George Goodfellow, Assistant Resident at x4.den, on behalf of the great British Government, do hereby affix their signatures and seal this 31st day of March 1879, equivalent to 8 Rubea-al-Akir, 1269, on board Her Majesty’s ship * Arab ’ at Maraya.” Major Goodfellow made the Chiefs clearly under stand* that, though they acknowledged no juris- * Major Goodfellow’s Report, 6th April diction of Egypt, that Power had, nevertheless, a 18,jr 9. claim over their coast, and in making the agree ment this point was not to be ignored, nor the more important one that, until ratified by the Government of India, the agreement could not come into force. A letter addressed to General Loch by Sultan Othman Mahomed indicated that the latter point at any rate was quite under stood. In reporting these proceedings, General Lochf t From Resident, No. 15, dated April strongly urged that the agreement should be con- 1879 * firmed by Government. There were, however, obvious objections to this course. If the British Government could treat with the Mijjerteyn Chiefs, their “ heirs and successors,” other Governments could do the same. It would not be possible to plead “ Egyptian jurisdiction ” as against Erench and Italian interference, and at the same time to justify our own direct dealings with the Chiefs, on the ground that such jurisdiction was not in fact exercised. The suggestion of the Eoreign Office that an Agreement with the Mijjerteyn Sultan might be regarded as made with him in his character of an independent ruler, quoad his territory beyond the recognized limits of Egyptian authority, but as in force temporarily within those limits also, scarcely seemed to meet the difficulty. Such an evasion of the Khedive’s nominal rights would be as open to foreign Governments as to our own. The danger of doing anything which might pre judice the position of the Egyptian Government on the coast was strongly illustrated by the circum stances reported by General Loch in the following despatch J addressed to the Secretary of State :— + dated 3r d April 1879. “ I have the honour to report, for your Lord ship’s information, that it has come to my know ledge that Mons. J. Suel, the keeper of the Erench Hotel de I’Univers, Aden, has obtained from the Chief of Alulah, Yousuf Ali, an agreement in writing purporting to be a covenant entered into between Yousuf Ali on the one part, and MM. Suel and Prichard on the other, by which the Alulah Chief grants permission to these two persons to build a lighthouse on Has Assur (Guardafui). “ The expenses of the construction of the light house, &amp;e., are to be borne solely by MM. Suel and Prichard, who in return for the permission thus21 • granted them, agree to pay to the Sultan of Alulah 500 dollars per mensem from the time the light house is first commenced. After the expiration of ninety years, the lighthouse itself and all other buildings and property pertaining to it will become the property of the Chief of Alulah gratis, that is, without cost. “ I have been informed that, on the strength of this written agreement, M. Suel, who is an active, enterprising man, with little or no means at his disposal, has written to a wealthy mercantile house at Marseilles, asking them whether they will under take to raise a Company and provide funds to enable this project to he carried out. M. Suel, however, is in no way sanguine that such a Com pany will be formed, and it is needless to add that such an undertaking seems hardly possible by a private Company, unless largely aided by their Government. “ In the event of his present project not being accepted, it is believed M. Suel will offer the right of building a lighthouse to the Italian Consul at Aden on certain conditions, and in the event of such an offer being made there is, I think, little doubt of its being accepted by him on behalf of his Government, as by that means the Italian Govern ment would not only become the possessors of what they now so much desire, viz., a footing on that part of the African littoral, but they would obtain it under the most favourable circumstances, i.e., under the ostensible motive of becoming general benefactors to the whole of the shipping and trading portion of the world. “ There is little doubt that a lighthouse on Ras Assur (Guardafui) is of the utmost importance, and that such is recognized by the trading com munity of every nation, and that one should and eventually will be built there ; it therefore appears to me more than probable that, if the Italian Go vernment were to intimate to the world at large that they had obtained permission from the Sultan of Alulah, who is the ruler on, and the possessor of, that part of the African coast, although such is now recognized by the British Government as being under the suzerainty of His Highness the Khedive, to build a lighthouse, but that their benevolent intentions were frustrated by the Egyptian Go vernment, who refused their sanction to this work of humanity, not only all foreign nations, but certain classes in England would raise such a clamour as would induce His Highness the Khe dive to grant the request of the Italian Govern ment, however averse he might be to such.” • To Foreign Office, 5th May 1879, This despatch was sent on to the Foreign Office* 32 f* with the following remarks :— “ Lord Cranbrook is of opinion that the matter brought to notice in General Loch’s letter calls for the attention of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Ras Assur is within the limits of the territory over which, by the Convention with 11516. F22 the Khedive, dated the 7th September 1877, Her Majesty’s Government lias on certain conditions consented to recognize Egyptian jurisdiction. If, therefore, that instrument has been brought into definitive operation by the assurance from the Sultan required by Article V., which Sir Henry Layard in November last was instructed to endea vour to obtain without loss of time, the validity of an agreement between the Chief of Alulah and other parties might be disputed by the Egyptian Government. Should the assurance in question not yet have been given, it seems to Lord Cran- brook desirable that the attention of Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople should again be called to the matter.” It would, however, plainly be impossible for the Egyptian Government to dispute the validity of Monsieur Suel’s agreement, and at the same time to recognize that concluded by Major Goodfellow. Accordingly, the Government of India were in formed by telegraph (6th May 1879) that the agreement with the Mijjerteyn Chiefs should not be confirmed pending instructions from home, and the Eoreign Office was informed accordingly in a letter,* in which Lord Cranbrook’s views on the general question were expressed as follows :— “ His Lordship considers that it would not be expedient for the British Government to contract treaty engagements with any of the Somali Chiefs within the limits which have been acknowledged as Egyptian, even though such Chiefs may also occupy territory beyond those limits. It may be inferred from the facts reported in General Loch’s despatch of the 5th April, which was forwarded to the Eoreign Office on the 5th instant, that the Mijjer teyn Chiefs are ready to enter into relations with all comers ; while it is obvious that the Khedive cannot be asked to recognize such relations in the case of Her Majesty’s Government, and to object to them if contracted by other Governments, who may equally be in a position to plead that the pur pose they have in view is in the general interest of humanity. “ At the same time, it is important that some inducement should be offered to the Somalis to protect persons and goods cast on their coast. Lord Cranbrook is, however, disposed to think that the conclusion of a formal agreement is not essential to this object, and that it may be attained by a verbal promise to the Chiefs of an annual payment of 360 dollars, during good behaviour, as proposed by Major Goodfellow, and of fair consideration of their claims in regard to salvage. “ In the event of Lord Salisbury concurring in this view, instructions in accordance with it will be sent to the Government of India. “ I am directed to add that it seems to Lord Cranbrook to be desirable that the correspondence on this matter should be communicated to Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt, with instruc tions to explain to the Khedive the considerations * To Foreign Office, 16th May 1879, No. 329-23 * From Foreign Office, 31st May 1879, No. 407. f Secret, No. 24, dated 26th June 1879.

Meanwhile, of course, Major Goodfellow’s Con vention remains unconfirmed. It may here be mentioned that the HesidentJ at Aden has lately purchased from M. Suel for 500 dollars the bond passed to him by the Alulah Chief, assigning certain rights to build on the land near Cape Guardafui; that the Italian Government§ has denied all knowledge of the alleged connection of their Consul at Aden with the project; that in December 1877, the British Government|| proposed to that of Italy the erection of a lighthouse on Cape Guardafui at the joint expense of the two Governments ; that the proposal was accepted in principle in August 1878, though nothing has since come of it; and that the Egyptian Government, while professing ignorance of the concession given to M. Suel, have declared that they could not admit the right of any person to conclude such an arrangement without their previous consent.^]' Another matter which has lately given rise to correspondence, and has directed attention to the im portance of an early settlement of the Somali coast question at Constantinople is the reported intention of the Italian Government to establish a Consulate at Zeyla. In a debate in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, at the close of January last, Signor De Pretis an nounced that the Government would at once establish such a Consulate,** in connection with the exploring expedition to Central Africa. The Besident at Aden having been asked for any observations which occurred to him on the subject, replied as follows :—ff “It is w T ell known to your Lordship that for some time past an ill-feeling has existed between King Menelek of Shoa and King John, and that this ill-feeling still exists, and the latter believes it to be nurtured and kept up at the instigation and by the advice of the members of the Italian expedition, who are the friends of King Menelek, and, I under stand, are now residing in his capital, Shoa. “ I am not in a position, however, to state whether24 King John’s suspicions have any reliable founda tions, as news direct from the interior of Africa only occasionally reaches this Residency; but as King Menelek is most ambitious, and wishes to make himself King of all Abyssinia, I think it must bo allowed that it is more than probable he would endeavour to utilize the services of all the Europeans in his capital in the most useful manner he could, and would he likely to listen to any advice or sug gestions they might from time to time offer. “ T have for some months past heard that the members of the Italian expedition have been im pressing on King Menelek the advantages he would derive from having a means of egress under his own control on the sea-coast for the products of his country, and that they have been urging him to attempt, by conquest or otherwise, to obtain a seaport somewhere between Tajourrah and Berbera, and that King Menelek is now most anxious to possess one. “ I think I am correct in saying that Her Ma jesty s Government have recognized King John of ligre as King of Abyssinia, and if such is the case we could not well recognize his opponent, or aid him in such a way as to increase the ill-feeling now existing between them, or possibly assist him to again attempt the overthrow of King John, which the establishment of an Italian Consulate on that part of the African littoral might cause, as I am inclined to think the Vice-Consulate would not only be used as the means of exporting the products of central Abyssinia, but it would be also largely used as the medium of importing large quantities of fire arms and ammunition for the use of King Menelek’s troops. “ There can be no question as to the benefits winch would be derived if the traffic with the interior of Abyssinia was properly opened up, but it cannot be doubted that the opening up of African trade through a Vice-Consulate from Italy at Zeyla would lead to a large importation of arms and ammunition, and, judging from what has already taken place, I am inclined to think possibly to the dethronement of King John, and may cause endless trouble and anxiety to the Egyptians*'hereafter. “ If I am right in supposing that the whole of the African coast from opposite Suez to Hafoun is recognized as under the suzerainty of the Egyptian Government, I presume it will be necessarv for the Italian Government to obtain permission from His Highness the Khedive to establish a Vice-Consulate at any port on that littoral, and the Egyptian Government will have themselves to blame, 1 should the difficulties and troubles I now foresee arise, irom such a step being sanctioned by His Highness the Khedive or the Egyptian Government. “ In conclusion, I would observe if the whole of tht Aiiican coast, as stated m the foregom 0, para graph, is recognized as under the suzerainty°of the Egyptian Government, I cannot perceive on what grounds Her Majesty’s Government can prevent25 the establishment of an Italian Vice-Consulate at Zeyla, or at any other port in Egyptian territory, provided the Egyptian Government is not adverse to such.” With reference to these remarks, a letter from * No. 339. the Foreign Office, dated 6th May 1879.* expressed Lord Salisbury’s opinion that Her Majesty’s Go vernment would have no right to object to the establishment of an Italian Consulate at Zeyla, the question being one for the decision of the Egyptian Government, but that they would be justified in using their influence to prevent the importation of arms and other warlike stores into any part of the Egyptian littoral, as they would only be used for the purpose of slave hunting and in intestine wars, which desolate the country and put a stop to legitimate trade. Cherif Pasha informed Mr. Vivian on the IHli June, that he had no knowledge of any intention on the part of the Italian Government such as f From Mr. Vivian, No. 25, dated 14th was attributed to them, f June 1879. General Loch’s despatch of the 28th March, on the above subject, drew from Sir R. Temple, the Governor of Bombay, a Minute (21st April 1879), urging the importance of “ both shores of the Gulf “ of Aden and the large island of Socotra, with the “ adjacent small island of Abd-ul-Kuri ” being l So far as Socotra and its dependencies under the control of the British Government. J are concerned, this object has been, as far as ^ # possible, attained by the agreement concluded After noticing the geographical features Ot the by General Schneider, on the 23rd January coast and recapitulating General Loch’s argu- 1876. See Appendix B. ments, Sir R. Temple observed : — “ Under these circumstances, I would strongly deprecate any foreign nation being permitted to gain a political footing anywhere on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden. “ As regards the scheme for constructing a lighthouse on Cape Guardafui, which scheme is dealt with in the despatch of the 5th April 1879, it would appear that, although the whole of the African coast to Ras Hafoun is nominally under the Egyptian Government, the negotiation for the building has been carried out between the French firm of Suel and Prichard and the Sultan of Alitlah. Now the Resident brings to notice that M. Suel, although active and enterprising, is a man of but small means. M. Suel, therefore, proposes to raise a Company in Marseilles for the purpose of carry ing out the project, but is by no means sanguine that such a Company can be formed; and the Resident is given to understand that, should the French Company’s project fall through, the offer will be made to the Italian Consul, who will accept it, thereby gaining for his Government a footing at an important point on the African coast, with the ostensible motive of becoming general benefactors to the shipping trade of the civilized world. “ It appears to me that the necessity for a light house at Cape Guardafui must be acknowledged, and that the British Government has, both for political and commercial reasons, the greatest 11516. G26 interest in its construction; and I would strongly advise, for the consideration of the Government of India, that this opportunity of establishing our selves in that important position on the African coast he not allowed to pass into the hands of a foreign Power without due consideration. Regard ing the urgent need of a lighthouse at this point for the protection of shipping, I would refer to my Minute of the 1st October 1877. “ The sum of the argument is this—that British interests indicate that this part of the African coast should continue to he under British influence. But as the just objects of commerce are concerned, it follows that if the British Government desires to exclude foreign influence, as it may naturally desire, it must of its own motion undertake to do what is required, namely, to establish, as soon as possible, a British Consulate at Zeyla or Tajourrah, and arrange the construction of a lighthouse at Guardafui.” This Minute was sent home by the Government of India,* with the remark that they were not con vinced that the actual state of affairs on the part of the African coast which was in question rendered urgently necessary the measures recommended by Sir R. Temple. In forwarding the papers on to the Foreign Office, Sir L. Mallet expressed Lord Cranbrook’s views as follows :—t &lt;c While Lord Cranbrook agrees with the Gover nor of Bombay in thinking it desirable that foreign influence other than that of the British Govern ment should, as far as possible, be excluded from the region in question, he shares the doubt ex pressed by the Government of India as to whether the actual state of affairs renders urgently neces sary the measures recommended by Sir R. Temple. “ The early construction of a lighthouse near Cape Guardafui is, however, of great importance to the interests of commerce, and Lord Cranbrook would accordingly be glad to be informed in due course whether Her Majesty’s Consul General in Egypt has thought it expedient to address to the Khedive the representation suggested in this Office letter of the 16th May, and, if so, with what result.” The letter referred toj had been communicated by the Foreign Office to Mr. Vivian on the 30th May, the question of pressing on the Khedive the necessity of asserting his jurisdiction over that part of the coast under the Mijjerteyn Somali Chiefs being left to the discretion of Her Majesty’s Consul General. § It now only remains to notice what has passed at Constantinople in regard to the Somali Coast Convention since Sir H. Layard’s despatch of the 4th December 1878. || On the 31st May 1879, Lord Salisbury (Despatch Iso, 752^j) forwarded to Her Majesty’s Ambassador the correspondence in regard to British relations * Secret, No. 142, dated 9th June 1879. f To Foreign Office, 18th July 1879, No. 542. X See p. 23. § The Government of India have since (Marine Letter, No. 26, dated the 11th August 1879) advocated that the lighthouse should be erected by the Egyptian Govern ment under pecuniary guarantees for the levy of tolls from all maritime Governments which are interested in the navigation of the Red Sea. This suggestion has been commu nicated to the Foreign Office (Letter, 27th September 1879, No. 742). || See p. 16. 11 From Foreign Office, 9th July 1879, No. 519.with the Somali Chiefs; in so doing, His Lordship observed :— “The difficulties to which this question has given rise are, as your Excellency will not fail to perceive, intimately connected with the jurisdiction exercised by the Khedive under the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte over that part of the African coast, and which formed the subject of the Convention entered into between His Highness and Her Majesty’s Govern ment on the 7th September 1877. “ Your Excellency stated, in a Despatch dated the 4th December last, that you had been informed by the Grand Vizier then in power that no com munication had at that time heen received by the Porte from the Khedive himself with regard to this Convention, since which time the matter does not appear to have been further noticed. t have now to instruct your Excellency again to bring it before the Sublime Porte, and to urge that no time may be lost in completing, so far as devolves upon them, those conditions, without which the Convention must continue to remain a dead letter.” Sir H. Layard (Despatch No. 525, dated 21st dune 1879) thus reported his proceedings conse quent on the above instructions :— I availed myself of an opportunity yesterday to press Caratheodory Pasha, as I have been con stantly doing for some time past, to give me an answer to my communication to the Porte respecting the Convention entered into by Her Majesty’s Government with the Khedive, by which Egyptian jurisdiction is acknowledged over the Somali terri tory on the African coast. I told His Excellency that Her Majesty’s Government had been recently informed that one of the Chiefs on that coast was about to make a concession to a person acting for the Italian Government for the erection of a light house on Has Assur, and that it was of importance that the Porte should come, without delay, to a decision as to recognizing the Convention in ques tion. I, therefore, desired to know what I might write to your Lordship on the subject. “ After making some excuses for not having given me an earlier answer, and fencing with my question. His Excellency said that jurisdiction on the African coast had hitherto only been accorded by the Sultan to the Khedive as far as Zeyla, and that the Porte had not made up its mind to extend that jurisdiction. Indeed, it was not impossible that the Porte might itself take measures to occupy and establish the authority of the Sultan over the Somali coast, and that conseqiiently it could not hastily admit the right of the Khedive to it. However, His Excellency promised to study the question, and to let me have an answer as soon as possible. “ I asked His Excellency why, considering that I had been incessantly speaking to himself and his predecessor on this matter, I had not before received28 the explanation he had now given me; but I could not obtain a satisfactory answer to my question. His Excellency, however, said that the territory in question unquestionably belonged to the Sultan, and that no Chief belonging to it had consequently any right to enter into an engagement with the Italian or any other Government of the nature of that to which I had referred without the previous consent of the Porte.” On the 2nd July, Lord Salisbury, by telegram, desired the Ambassador to take the earliest oppor tunity of obtaining from the Porte the confirmation of the Convention, Her Majesty’s Government being anxious for settlement of the matter, as some uneasiness was caused by the proceedings of the Italian Government on that coast. Sir H. Layard answered (7th July):— “ There seems to be some hesitation about the answer to be given to me to my note communicating the Convention relating to Somali coast. I am pressing for one. Minister for Poreign Affairs in forms me the Porte has telegraphed* to Tewfik Pasha to take possession of coast between Zeyla and Pas-al-Hafoun, to hoist Ottoman flag, to con stitute administration, to send functionaries, and not to permit any foreigners to settle there ; and that arrangements as to the future government of coast will be made hereafter.” To tliis, Lord Salisbury replied by telegraph (8th July) :— “ Her Majesty’s Government consider it most important that a promise should be obtained from the Sultan that no portion of the African coast on the Red Sea or Indian Ocean belonging to His Imperial Majesty shall be alienated to any other foreign Power. If this engagement is not speedily given on the part of the Porte, there are indications of probable movements on the part of other Powers which may render it impossible that such an under taking on the part of the Turkish Government should be obtained.”t Upon the above correspondence being commu nicated by the Poreign Office to this Office, the language used by Safvet Pasha, as reported by Sir H. Layard in his despatch of the 21st June, attracted notice, and the following remark was made in replying to the Poreign Office:—+ “ With reference to the assertion made by the Turkish Minister for Pqreign Affairs, that the ‘ territory in question unquestionably belongs to ‘ the Sultan,’ Lord Cranbrook would invite Lord Salisbury’s attention to letters from this Office, dated the 25th September 1874, 27th August 1875,§ apd 27th Jahuary 1877,|| from which it will be seen that that view has never been accepted by Her Majesty’s Government.” On the 13th July, Sir H. Layard telegraphed :— “ * have received answer on Somali coast ques tion. It states that Porte considers that authority •No such telegram had been received by the Egyptian Government up to the 22nd July (Despatch from Mr. Lascelles, No. 31). t From Foreign Office, 11th July 1879, No. 522. t To Foreign Office, 12th July 1879, No. 519. § Memorandum, 26th February 1876 ; pp. 9 and 21. || See ante, p. 7. 1 From Foreign Office, 16th July 1879, No. 543.29 * From Foreign Office, No. 625. t Despatch, No. 1023, 1879. of the Sultan should be established at once over that country, so as not to permit any foreign in fluence from taking {sic) advantage of present state of things. Consequently Tewfik Pasha has been directed by telegraph to take possession of it in the name of the Sultan, and to prevent any foreign authority from being established in it on any pre text whatsoever. “ Subsequently, as province of Somali has never formed part of possessions ceded to Egypt, an un derstanding will have to be come to with the Khedive for its administration. “ Minister for Foreign Affairs gives positive assurance that in coming to that understanding nothing will be omitted to satisfy intentions of Her Majesty’s Government indicated in Convention, and which have been referred to decision of the Porte.” But on the following day, His Excellency tele graphed again that the above answer had been sent by mistake, and had been withdrawn. On the 2nd August Sir H. Layard reported:— “ I have received amended note about Somali “ coast. It corresponds nearly with that of which “ substance was sent you in my telegram No. 544, “ except that paragraph beginning, ‘ Consequently “ 4 Tewfik Pasha,’ is altered to, 4 A telegram has “ 4 been sent to Tewfik Pasha ordering him to send 44 4 the necessary authorities protecting the rights 44 4 of the Empire, and to prevent any foreign 44 4 authority from establishing itself on the coast in 44 4 question on any pretext whatever.’ The last 44 phrase is changed to, 4 Satisfy the intentions of 44 4 Her Majesty’s Government indicated in doeu- 44 4 ments relating to this question.’ 44 Hoes your Lordship consider answer sufficient ?” 19thAugust 1879, Lord Salisbury replied* (Despatch, No. 1019, dated 3rd August, extending telegram) :— 44 The note which the Porte proposes to address to the Egyptian Government on this matter will scarcely meet the merits of the case. What Her Majesty’s Government desire is a firman, or such a diplomatic document as could be made use of in dealing with other foreign Powers, signifying the approval by the Porte of the engagement which the Khedive contracted towards Her Majesty’s Govern ment by the Convention of the 7th September 1877, to the effect that no loreign Power should be per mitted to establish itself on any portion of the African coasts of the Red Sea or of the coast of the Indian Ocean as far south as Egyptian jurisdiction extends, viz., to the cape known as Ras Hafoun.” The Ambassador having inquired, on the 4th August, what kind of diplomatic document was dated 4th August required, was informed on the same dayf that a note from the Porte to the Egyptian Government, approving the Convention of the 7th September 1877, would probably suffice, but that if the Porte could be induced to issue a firman of approval, it 11516. H30 would undoubtedly have more weight in the event of any question on the subject being raised by foreign Powers. The text of Sawas Pasha’s note referred to in Sir H. Layard’s telegram of the 2nd August was as follows :— “ Sublime Porte, “ M. 1’Ambassadeur, le 2 Aout 1879. “ J’ai re^'u la note que votre Excellence m’a fait Thonneur de m’adresser relativement au terri- toire de Somali. “ Le Gouvernement Imperial, ayant pris connais- sance de cette question, a reconnu qu’il y avait convenance et opportunite h ce que les autorit^s du Gouvernement Imperial fussent installees sur cettc partie des territories de Sa Majesty Imperiale le Sultan, afin qu’aucune influence no fut port6e h se prevaloir de la situation dans laquelle se trouvent ces parages. “ En consequence, un telegramme vient d’etre adress4 a Son Altesse le Kiiedive lui prescrivant d y envoyer les autorit^s n^cessaires pour sauvegar- der les droits de I’Empire, et d’empecher que sous quelque pretexte que ce soit aucune autorite etran- gere ne s’y etablisse. “ Cette premiere mesure accomplie, comme la cote de Somali n’a jamais fait partie des possessions concedees &amp; differentes epoques &amp; 1’Administration Egyptienne, le regime administratif qui devra etre applique au pays fera I’objet d’instructions speciales qui seront addressees au Khedive, et je puis donner d&amp;s aujourd’hui &amp; votre Excellence l assurance que la Sublime Porte aura soin de ne rien negliger pour donner satisfaction aux intentions du Gouvernement Britannique telles qu’elles sont indiquees dans les documents relatifs &amp; cette question.” In forwarding this document Sir H. Layard, accounting for the delay which had taken place in obtaining it, observed :* “It would seem that the “ Porte could not make up its mind to recognize “ the right of the Khedive to exercise jurisdiction “ on the coast in question, and wished to establish “ upon it the direct authority of the Sultan.” Sawas Pasha’s note was not regarded by the Secretary of State for India as at all satisfactory. While, on the one hand, it, by implication, renewed the claim of the Turkish Government to the Somali coast, as having always formed a part of the Ottoman dominions, it did not, on the other hand, contain any distinct assurance that no por tion of the territory which was the subject of the Convention with Egypt should ever be ceded to any foreign Power. An observation to the above effect was made to the Foreign Office,f attention at the same time being again called to the former correspondence bearing on the point. On the 27th August, Sir H. Layard repeated to the Foreign Office the following telegram which he * Despatch, No. 689, dated 2nd August 1879. f To Foreign Office, 20th August 1879, No. 619.31 had sent to Mr. Lascelles, the Acting Consul General * From Foreign Office, 28th August 1879, in hgypt :—* ^°‘ 646 ’ “ In consequence of request of Her Majesty’s Government that Porte should issue a firman, or send a note to me, declaring that it will not permit any foreign authority to establish itself on the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean, a firman to that effect [has], I am told by the Minister for Eoreign Affairs, been sent to the Viceroy of Egypt for his opinion. I should be glad if you would get His Highness to send an answer to the Porte as soon as possible, as the matter presses. “ When firman is issued, it will be communicated to me in an official note.” | No. 664. On the 3rd Septemberf the Eoreign Office for- . warded for Lord Cranbrook’s concurrence the draft of an instruction which Lord Salisbury proposed to address to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople with regard to the claim of the Porte to regard the Somali territory as having always formed part of the Sultan’s dominions. After referring to the letters from this Office of the 12th July and 20th August, the draft went on :— “ I understand from your Excellency’s telegram. No. 636, of the 27th ult., that the Porte proposes to issue a firman to the Khedive containing: a declaration that no foreign authority shall be per mitted to establish itself upon the coast in question, and that this firman will be communicated to you in an official note. I trust, therefore, that owing to your Excellency’s exertions the question will shortlv be settled in a satisfactory manner. * v “ In case, however, that the terms of the firman or note should prove to be insufficient, or that other difficulties should arise, it would be your Excel lency’s duty to point out to the Porte, in courteous but decided language, that the claim made to these territories as having always formed a part of the Ottoman dominions is one which Her Majesty’s Government have felt compelled to reject, as incon sistent with well known facts, and with the treaties concluded between Great Britain and the Chiefs on the coast, and to state that Her Majesty’s Govern- ment can only consent to recognize the extension of Egyptian jurisdiction over the coast on the con ditions mentioned in the Convention of the 7th of September 1877.” Lord Cranbrook’s entire concurrence in the above instructions was intimated to the Eoreign Office on X No. 664. the 5th September.^ § From Foreign Office, 29th September On the 15th September, § the Acting Consul 1879, No. 752. General in Egypt (Despatch, No. 571) reported as follows:— “The Khedive informed me a few days ag:o that he had received a telegram from the Porte, instruct ing him to send a force to the Somali coast to take possession of the territory between Zeyla and Ras Hafoun in the name of the Sultan, to hoist the32 Turkish flag, and to build a lighthouse at Cape Guardafui. “These instructions have placed His Highness in a position of some embarrassment. He is anxious not to give any cause of complaint to the Porte by not carrying out the orders of the Sultan, but in the present condition of Egypt it was im possible for him either to send a force to the Somali coast, or to go to the expense of building a lighthouse at Guardafui, which would also entail the necessity of maintaining a force in the neigh bourhood. “ His Highness has, therefore, telegraphed to Constantinople to state that the Turkish flag was hoisted in the territory in question two years ago, and giving the reasons which make it impossible for him at the present moment either to send a force or to incur the expense of building a light house.” On the 18th September,* Her Majesty’s Ambas sador at Constantinople enquired whether the firman about to be issued should be officially com municated to the representatives of all the Powers without distinction, or to those of the great Powers only. Lord Salisbury replied (23rd September) that it should be communicated to the last-men tioned representatives only, but that it was impor tant that Sir H. Layard should see the draft before the firman was issued, and satisfy himselt that its terms were satisfactory. On the 25th September,! Her Majesty’s Chargfi d’Affaires at Constantinople (Mr. Malet) telegraphed the text of the firman proposed to be addressed to the Khedive :—“ I bring to your knowledge that, “ by a firman emanating by my order from the “ Imperial Divan, the administration of the terri- “ tory comprised between Zeyla and A1 El Hafoun “ i s provisionally confided to you. In consequence, “ you will administer this territory on the same “ title as the territory of Egypt, maintaining in it “ order and security, and protecting against all in- “ fringement my sovereign rights over this part “ of the domain of my Empire.” * From Foreign Office, 24th September 1879, No. 725. | From Foreign Office, 26th September 1879, No. 735. Mr. Malet added that the firman would be com municated to the Great Powers, and that in the note to the British Government a paragraph would be added giving an assurance that no portion of the territory shall be ceded to any foreign Power. On the 29th September,J Mr. Malet telegraphed + From Foreign Office, 3rd October 1879, again:—“ At the instance of Council of Ministers No. 747. “ Safvet Pasha asks whether Her Majesty’s Go- “ vernment would be willing that Egypt should “ pay tribute for Somali coast, as at present for “ Zeyla. It is not proposed to exact anything now, “ but later, if the country yields a revenue, Council “ i s of opinion that the surplus should be exacted “ as a tribute. “ I said that I trusted that issue of firman in no, “ wav depended on answer of Her Majesty’s Go- “ vernment, as its urgency was great. His High-—,— 33 c ‘ ness replied that the firman was quite a separate “ affair, but to obtain an answer could not take “ long, and he asked me to telegraph immediately. “ Payment of tribute would* be a confirmation of “ sovereignty of Porte. ,, It will he observed that in the firman the territory to which it refers is spoken of as being .SI “comprised between Zeyla and Al El Hafoun” This language, by itself, might have been held to include Zeyla. But Mr. Malet’s telegram of the 29th September made it clear that by the Porte that place was not now considered to be in question, it being no doubt regarded as having already been made over to Egypt by a firman which was issued in 1875, but of which Her Majesty’s Government * Memorandum, 26th February 1876, bad not recognized the validity.* ^ But if Zeyla, and the coast to the north of it, including Tajourrah, were not covered by the terms of the firman, neither would the assurance proposed to be specially given to Her Majesty’s Government apply to them, but it was in reference to those places that such an assurance, if of any value at all, Avas perhaps most needed at the present time. Accordingly, Lord Cranbrook’s opinion having been asked both as to the sufficiency of the pro posed firman and assurance, and on the question of tribute, his Lordship directed the following reply Forei g n 0ffic e* 3rd October 1879, to be sent :f—“In Lord Cranbrook’s opinion the “ course noAv proposed may be accepted as satis factory and sufficient for the object which Her “ Majesty’s Government have in view, provided it “ be clearly understood that the assurance to be “ given by the Porte applies to Zeyla and the coast “ north of that place, including Tajourrah, not less “ than to the coast between Zeyla and Ras Hafoun, which is specifically mentioned in the firman “ intended to be addressed to the Khedive. “ Both Zeyla and Tajourrah form the subject of “ a special stipulation in the Convention of 7th “ September 1877, and have always been supposed “ to be included in the territory referred to in that “ instrument, the validity of the firman by which “ Zeyla was placed under the administration of the “ Khedive in 1875 not having, so far as Lord Cran- “ brook is aware, been recognized by Her Majesty’s “ Government. “ In making these remarks, Lord Cranbrook does “ not wish to be understood as suggesting that any “ discussion should now be opened with the Turkish “ Government in regard to its rights over Zeyla “ and Tajourrah, his Lordship merely refers to the “ point in order that it may not be overlooked. “ With regard to the question .... whether “ Her Majesty’s Government would be willing that “ the Khedive should pay to the Sultan tribute for “ the coast included in the firman now to be issued, “ as His Highness does at present for Zeyla, I am directed to state that, so far as Lord Cranbrook “ is in a position to form an opinion in a matter on 11.516. i34 * c which Lord Salisbury is better able to judge, it “ does ^not appear to his Lordship that Her Ma- “ jesty’s Government need raise any objection to “ such an arrangement.” On the second of the two questions referred to in the above letter, the following instructions were sent by Lord Salisbury to Mr. Malet, on the 4th October (Despatch, No. 1230):—* * From Foreign Office, 10th October c ’ The draft firman .... contains nothing: 1879, No. 778. which would prevent the Sultan from claiming at a later pei’iod tribute from the Khedive for the Somali coast, should that district ever become rich, which it is not very probable it will ever become- To raise the question at this moment would cause endless difficulty and long delay in the settlement of the question. You should inform the Turkish Government that unless their right to the Somali coast is established without delay, it will be lost to them, as questions are being raised as to the owner ship of the coast by the rulers both of Shoa and Abyssinia.” This brings the correspondence down to date.

The memorandum reproduces correspondence between the Resident at Aden, the Secretary of State for India, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which the authors consider the impact of Egyptian and Turkish influence at Berbera on British trade interests at Aden; on the independence of local Somali tribes; and on British efforts to suppress the slave trade. The memorandum also includes the terms by which HM Government agree to recognise Egyptian sovereignty.Appendices to the first part of the memorandum reproduce several 'Treaty Relations with Tribes on the African Coast' and 'Geographical Notes'.The second part of the memorandum opens with an account of events which preceded the signing in 1877 of the Somali Coast Convention by the British Government and by the Egyptian Khedive, describing the Khedive's attempts to extend the limit of proposed Egyptian sovereignty as far south as the Juba River, and subsequent British threats to enter into agreements with Somali chiefs independently of the Khedive.The memorandum goes on to describe renewed discussions in connection with the procedure in Constantinople necessary to give validity to the Convention after it was signed by the Khedive, and reproduces a note issued by the Ottoman Porte, which asserts Turkish sovereignty over the territory covered by the Convention, but falls short of providing assurances against ceding any of that territory to other foreign powers.The memorandum closes with the reproduction of correspondence discussing the text of a proposed firman, to be issued by the Ottoman Porte, which would give validity to the Convention signed by the Khedive.Appendices to the second part of the memorandum reproduce the text of the 'Somali Coast Convention' and an 'Agreement in regard to the Island of Socotra'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khedive of Egypt</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Berbera</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Egypt</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x000386#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
