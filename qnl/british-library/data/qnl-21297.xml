TT^OR facility of reference, or greater handiness and portability, the Gazetteer of Persia has been prepared in four separate volumes, the portions of the country treated being divided as follows between the different volumes :— Vol. I comprises — The article under head of 44 Persia ” in the first volume is so exhaustive that it forms a Preface in itself; so that a lengthened one here becomes superfluous. The boundaries of the country comprised in Vol. I are as fol lows :—On the east, the Afghan border from the Helmand to r Sarakhs; thence a line north-west to Askhabad, due west to the Atrak, which it follows to the Caspian; then along the sea- Astarabad. Shahrud-Bustan. Khurasan. Sistan. Vol. II comprises — Azarbaijan. Vol. Ill comprises — Pars. Luristan. Khuzistan. Arabistau. Yazd. Kavmansbah. Ardalan. Kurdistan Talish. Mazandaran. Gilan. ^Malair.

Makran.coast to Ashurada island; thence in a straight line to Shahrud; and from the latter south-east to Tabas hill, Sihkuha, and the Helmand, where that river first strikes the south-east border of Sistan. The Hunterian method of spelling has been adopted. The list of Authorities consulted has reference to those used in the compilation of the whole four volumes. Lieutenant-Colonel Bell’s Military Report on South-West Persia, 1884, and Captain B. H. Jenning’s Report of Reconnaissance in Persian Baluchis tan, 1885, have been omitted from the list, and should be included. The inadvisability of further delaying the publication of the first volume prevents the mass of information collected by the Boundary Commission regarding this north-east corner of Persia being incorporated in it. The information will probably soon be collected and published separately, and must be read in conjunction with the present Vol. I, the latter without it being incomplete. A Medical Report on Northern Persia will be found in the Preface of Vol. II; while medical information regarding the parts of Southern Persia adjoining the telegraph line from Bushahr northward will be found- under the headings of the different telegraph stations in Vol. III. Simla, November 26th, 1885.PREFACE The districts Boundaries. comprised in this work are as shown on the title page. The boundaries are approxi mately as follows:— On the west the Turkish frontier as far north as lake Urmia, thence a line south-east from Maragha through Sainkala and Sihna to Kangawar; south-east along the Chihal Na-Balighan range to a little south of Burujird, then south-east to Ardal Targhan, and on to south of Yazdikhast. Thence north to Bambir, south-east to Yazd, south to Niris and Parpa, south west to Darab, Jahrum, and Tallin on the coast. This comprises a sea-board on the Persian Gulf of about 350 miles from Pao to Tahiri, a brief Sea-board. „ .... „ report ot which is as follows :— “ From Muhammarah, on the right bank of the Hafar canal, near its ^ , -junction with the Shatt-al-Arab, to Bushahr, a Coast line and offing. ° .. .. ... .. distance ot over 200 miles, the coast line lies low, and is fronted by a shallow offing, the 3-fathom line being at an average distance of to 3 miles from it; its harbours, or ‘banders,’ scarcely deserve the name. Taking advantage of a creek, or a river, which has worked for itself a way through the sandy offing to low water, often a distance of from 1 to 2 miles, the native craft of the gulf will run up them at high tides, and there lie aground till the next favour able tide enables them to leave. The immediate shore line often consists of a belt of low sand hills, 10 feet to 15 feet high and 100 to 300 yards deep. “ The principal craft that trade from these ports beyond the gulf are called ‘ baghalahs; ’ they are from 100 to 400 tons, and are clumsily rigged with a huge main sail and latteen sail and small latteen “mizen.” They cannot tack and require a large crew. They do not go to sea in the south-west monsoon. Though clumsy in appearance above water, with a high poop, they have fine bottoms and sail well, especially in light winds {Persian Gulf Pilot).“ The boats in use on the Karun, and on the rivers generally, for ^ ^ cargo purposes combine the advantages of sails and oars; they are of various sizes, from 5 tons to 70 tons burden, and are of one uniform shape, having a broad raking bow, much of which is out of water, and a full and heavy stern, with a kind of open poop, raised for the accommodation of the captain and his crew, the rest of the space being left for the cargo. In general, the rig is the same, consisting of one mast, nearly amidships, leaning very much forward, and spreading an immense latteen sail, which extends from stem to stern. The ordinary size of such a boat is 90 feet long and 20 feet wide ; the draft of water is 7 feet 3 inches, and the vessel carries about 70 tons {Chesney). “The boats used on the rivers contiguous to the Karun (Euphrates, &amp;c.), resemble a half moon in shape; their ribs and flanks are roughly nailed together, and the outside coated with bitumen; they have no keel; the rudder is a clumsy contrivance of spars of large size with one mast carrying a large latteen sail, they can tack against the current. “ Ballams, or beilams, in general use on the Karun, are 15 feet to 20 feet long, 3 feet wide, flat bottomed; they draw 6 inches of water; pro vided with a huge latteen sail, they fly down stream. Harbours. ^ The chief harbours between Bushahr and Muhammarah are: — Khor Ru-hilla.—Navigated by boats of small burden for some miles to the village of the same name; it is shallow at the en trance. “ Khor Geseir.—A large creek, frequented by large boats. “ Bandar Rig.—A small creek, inside which boats lie aground. Genawah. Near it is Khor Khalil, a tidal creek or watercourse. “ Khor Sim, Khor Abd, Khor Lulatain.—All small creeks, which can be safely approached to within a mile. “ Dilam. ^ Shah Abu-al-Shah, where is a small creek used by coasting craft. “ Tab river or Hindiyan river.—Entrance shallow ; boats of 20 to 30 tons navigate the river. “ Khor Mashur.—A large salt water inlet, receiving the waters of the Dorak river. “ They being all of the same nature, and no one of the small harbours General characteristics. havm g a distinct advantage over any other T n . for military purposes they are of equal value, n all cases piers would have to be constructed along the line of the eepest water to enable steam launches to lie alongside at all times of the tide whilst the transports anchored off shore 2 to 3 miles in the water sm e o t eir draught. The shore line produces hard-wood trees in ii^merou^ mbeiS ' Ab ° Ut ^ C ° aSt villages palm trees are occasionally' Inland the country is practically treeless, and labour to construct piers, &amp;c., not procurable. “ For detailed information about Bushahr roadstead, see under that heading/’ The following is an abridged account of the Persian Gulf Trade, 1884: — “ Grain .—The year 1884 disappointed the expectations which its opening months tended to raise as regards trade in South Persia. An unusually large rainfall in the cultivating season of 1883-84 gave hopes of a splendid harvest, but later in the season unfavourable con ditions of weather caused a partial blight of the grain, which turned out of a harder description than usual, with a large proportion of shrivelled grains. There occurred, however, no scarcity of Corn, as, besides a surplus of the 1884 crops available for exportation, a good deal of the 1883 grain had been kept back. That shipments were on a moderate scale was due chiefly to the fall of prices in European markets. “ In the early part of 1884 London prices were good for well-cleaned wheat, but, harvests everywhere having turned out abundant, prices soon began to fall, and a reduction of 20 per cent, was observable from Febru ary to August. In December a rise occurred, and the year 1885 opened more favourably for t'.ie grain trade. “ Persian agriculturists have the habit of mixing barley largely with wheat, sometimes to the proportion of 50 per cent., and, as only well- cleaned wheat was saleable last year in London, some Persian merchants who neglected the precaution of sifting suffered losses. Wheat is now cleaned by machinery in Bushahr. It is remarked that the fluctuations of prices of grain in European markets do not, to a corresponding extent, influence the local prices in Persia. “ The operations of British merchants in exportation of wheat have been greatly hampered, and, in fact, when very low prices ruled in London, completely stopped, by levy of export duty both at the small outports such as Bandar Rig and Dilam, and also at Bushahr, in addition on final exportation. Large quantities of grain are purchaseable at Rig and Dilam, though the wheat is said, as a rule, to be inferior in quality to that brought from Dashti and other districts to the south. “ Opium .—The next most important produce is opium. The crop of last year was considerably damaged by rain, and the yield was under the average and prices in the interior kept high. Less was consequently shipped to London than usual. The Persian opium is said to be less adulterated now than formerly, and to be therefore more popular in European and American markets, competing well with Turkish opium. Hostilities in China increased the demand for Persian opium in that quarter.Vlll “ Cotton .—The cotton grown in Persia is handicapped as an export by want of cheap carriage and cannot be sent to England, but only to the cheaper market of Bombay. “ ybifocce*.—Tobacco exportation is on the increase, and is of some importance. “ Imported goods .—The trade in imported goods was unimproved, and European firms operated on a smaller scale and for a very small margin of profit. Especially was this the case in copper, sugar, mexicans, yarn, and shirtings. There was in the summer much depression in the piece goods trade, the demand being very small. It is remarkable that trade in chintzes is increasing in importance. This fact appears to support the opinion of the Legation Agent at Isfahan as to the cause of decrease of importation of indigo there, mentioned in Mr. Dickson’s report, dated 31st October 1881. Mr. Aganoor stated that, whereas the peasantry formerly wore stout T. cloths, dyed with indigo, they now used fancy prints, which went to show an increase of prosperity amongst that class of the popu lation. “Increase of piece goods .—In the same report Mr. Dickson explains that the large increase in the importation of piece goods and loaf sugar in recent years to Isfahan is not due to an increase of the trade of Persia generally, but to the diversion of the channel for trade from the north to the south of Persia, owing to the virtual prohibition on the transit of foreign goods through Russian territory, and also from the fact that the cheapness of freight aud general facilities of the sea route from Europe to the Persian Gulf have diverted goods from the Turkish route to Bushahr. Those best acquainted with the facts state that Russian goods have nearly disappeared from the markets of Shiraz and Isfahan. “ Sugar .—The bounty granted by the French Government on sugar refined in France has had the effect of supplanting the former trade in soft sugars from Java. Large imports occur of French beet-root sugar at Bandar Abbas and Bushahr. This may be greatly due to low prices ruling in Europe and to the prohibitory taxation in the Caucasus. It is, however, thought that the more general use of refined loaf sugar indi cates improvement in the condition of the population of Persia. “ The most cursory perusal of the trade reports of this Residency for the past ten years or so will show that in that period there has been a veiy remarkable increase of the trade of South Persia generally. The total value of the Bushahr trade appears to have about doubled or, in rough numbers, risen from ten to twenty millions of rupees. The trade of the second seaport, Bandar Abbas, has increased in round numbers from three to eight millions of rupees. “ ^ ie customs revenues of Bushahr were farmed out in 1884 for kirans 800,000, being double the amount realized ten years back. The customs revenues of Bandar Abbas were let in 1884 for kirans 701,500, showinga similar increase. The customs lease of Lingah has been raised in the same period from 65,000 to 160,000 kirans. u 'European -firms .—In former times one European firm (English) only did business in Bushahr. Now there are two English firms and one Dutch firm, with agents and branches in Central Persia and at Basra. Se veral British mercantile houses also do extensive business through native agents at Bushahr and other places in Persia. “ Steamers .—The British India Steam Navigation Company's steam ers run weekly from Bombay carrying mails under contract, and the Bombay-Persian Steam Navigation Company run vessels about monthly between Bombay and Bushahr-Basra. Two lines of direct steamers be tween England and the Persian Gulf are now working, one English and one French. Many special steamers are usually chartered. During 1884 fewer than usual were taken up, owing to short harvests in Mesopotamia. The French steamers are heavily subsidized by the Government of France, and this lowers freights to the detriment of British shipping. At the same time, it is to be remarked that these French steamers carry almost exclusively English cargo, and the. lowering of freights results in benefit to British manufacturers and consumers. The classes to suffer by the system are therefore British and other shipowners and French taxpayers. “ Dutch Commercial Treaty .—The Dutch-Persian commercial treaty has not, so far as known, been yet ratified. “Naphtha springs .—The Dutch firm of Hotz and Son has obtained the concession to work the petroleum or naphtha springs of Daliki and borings have been made. The quality and quantity of oil obtainable is not yet known. “ The customs of all Persia have of late been farmed from the Shah by the Amln-us-Sultan, who places agents at the principal towns. This system has led to a conflict of interests between the administrative authorities of Ears and the customs authorities. Foreign merchants are sufferers from this clash, and their operations at small ports of wheat-grow ing districts are hampered and obstructed. The head of the customs houses insists on levying 5 per cent, duty on all grain exported from Bushahr and declines to acknowledge receipts for duty levied at out-ports. The petty chiefs of those ports, however, and the Government of Fars are naturally intent on continuing the levy of duty, in some form or other at the out-ports, and although strict orders are said to be issued that such duty is not to be levied, various indirect means and devices are resorted to and the British merchants are still subject to a double tax on produce purchased at Rig, Dilam, &amp;c. “ Dearl fishing .—The pearl diving was productive in 1884. An at tempt was made to obtain pearls on the Persian coast by employing European divers, but the result was not encouraging. “ The year 1885 opened more hopefully for trade, there being fair de mand for all classes of goods, and the harvest prospects being very good.“Inland from the low sandy shore, extends to the low hills of sand- # stone and conglomerate a vast level of variable Plains Wering the width (average 35 miles), a barren mud flat for seaboard. some m il e s, liable to be flooded by high tides and heavy rains, and beyond a plain growing cereals of various kinds, melons, &amp;c.; it is sparsely populated, its few villages being planted at consider able intervals apart; water is found 10 feet from the surface; it is of good quality, except for some miles to the east of the Karun. Wells are numerous in and round about the villages not situated on streams (few). It is poorly irrigated. A few trees, chiefly the date palm, grow round about the villages only; firewood is scarce. Each village com munity owns from 50 to 60 donkeys, 300 to 500 sheep, and 5 or 6 cows. “ The climate of this plain may be assumed not to vary to any appreciable extent from that of Abu-shahr. “ Its summer heat is tempered by no rain, and it well deserves the name of Garmsir, given to it by the Persians. The pasturage during the hot months of the year is burnt up, scant, and of a poor quality ; the chief food of all cattle consists of chopped straw and barley, both plentiful. “ The only supplies procurable from the villages in limited quantities are fowls, sheep, milk, eggs, butter, raughan (ghi), barley, corn, and chopped straw. “ The coast district, extending from Hindiyan to Bandar Big, is known as Lihrawi. “ A desert stretches from Bandar Dilam westward to within 5 or 6 miles of Dorak. The river Tab runs through it; its banks are cultivated. The vicinity of Dorak is fertile; dates and rice are grown there and along the banks of the Hafar and Shatt-ul-Arab. The rice crops are harvested in August and September; other grains in April and May. The best pasturage is found inland to the north and west. “ If the rains have been plentiful, the plains to the east-south-east of Bandar Ma'shur are covered with grass above a horse’s knees. If they have been deficient, the grass will be short and fit for sheep, but not for cattle. “ The sea coast plain from Muhammarah to Dilam is bountifully watered by the Karun, the Tab, the Hindiyan, the Jarrahi, &amp;c. It would be difficult to find a territory of equal extent, where fresh water, containing sufficient salt, is poured through the plain in channels so numerous and so easily manageable. Its rivers are its element of greatest commercial strength and military weakness, for, by damming the exits of this water towards the sea, the Persians flooded the country and reduced the K’ab Arabs. * Irrigation capabilities. * The Garmsir extends to some distance within the hills.I XI Hilly interior. “ The K’ab territory is by no means an easy one to traverse. The portion adjoining the coast is impassable in the wet season, and during the subsidence of floods it would be fatal to horses and men, whether from miasma or the marsh insects. “The water from wells near the coast is brackish {Velly). The water-supply of Ma'shur drawn from wells just outside its walls is brackish. “ Its exports are wool, wheat, barley, rice, ghi, and sheep. “ Its imports are piece-goods and dates. “ Each petty bandar carries on a limited trade in the above. “ The low hills above referred to, originating in the Kablr-Kuh, Outer range of sandstone stietch from the Karkhah at Kal a Haudar and and conglomerate. the Karun at Ahwaz in a south-east direction towards Chham, ordinarily known as Zeitun, to the sources of the Hindiyan or Zoreh river, where they amalgamate with the outer hills of the main Bakhtiari and Kuhgehlu ranges, stretching from KaFa Kasim, past Ab-i-Bid, Ram-Hurmuz and Pashkar, to the vicinity of Abu-shahr. Between the two ranges lie the plains of Ram-Hurmuz and Bihbahan. “ North and north-eastward of the minor range of hills is the hilly country known as the “ Sardsir,” whither the Iliyats migrate during the heat of the summer months. “ A glance at the map of Persia will show the very uniform direction of the hill ranges from north-west to south- Mountain system. . , • , . .. -.i east, which, in connection with the similar he of the Persian Gulf, authorities consider accounts for the prevailing winds in the Gulf. “In the north-west portion of the country comprised in this Gazetteer, the ranges of the southern portion are continued in the mighty Zagros chain and its offshoots, which stretch away in the same general direction to the Turkish frontier. Many of the streams on this side—like the Karkhah and its affluents—are attracted to the drainage line of the Karun valley, others pierce the chain of hills marking the Turkish frontier and flow westward into the valley of the Tigris. “ In Lieutenant-Colonel BelFs Military Report on South- West Persia, the reader can refer for full information regarding this portion of Persia (pages 39 to 47 and 68 to 81), and it would be super fluous to enter more fully into a description of it.

A village in the province of Ears, about 28 miles from Bushahr. It has 150 houses, inhabited by a tribe called Abadehi, with an annual revenue of 350 tumans. {Felly) ABADAN—Lat. Long. Elev. An island in Khuzistan, formed by the Hafar canal joining the Shatt-ul-Arab and the Bahr-el-Mashir rivers, and bounded north and west by the former, east by the latter and south by the Persian Gulf. Its shape is triangular, two sides having a length of about 30 miles, and the third, or base, of not more than 10 miles. There are many villages on the island, and it is covered with date trees and swamps, filled with high reeds and rank vegetation of all sorts. There was formerly a village on it of this name, but now it is a mass of ruins. The Daris tribe, numbering 400 males, and tributary to Muhammarah inhabit huts in the island. Kinneir distinctly states that the Bahr-el-Mashir is the outlet of the Karun river, but Sir Henry Rawlinson exposes this error, and says it is the east arm of the delta of the Shatt-ul-Arab. From this error the whole island of Abadan was surrendered to Persia by treaty. During the Persian campaign of 1856, the Persians erected five batteries on the north side of the island, some of which were intended to prevent the British passing up the Shatt-ul-Arab, or Bahr-el-Masdiir to Muhammarah. (Chesney—Rawlinson — Kinneir — Holland — Ross.) ABADEH—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruinous village in Ears on the north bank of Lake Nargis. It lies between Tasht and Khushkhak. Round it is some opium cultiva tion and Iliyat encampments. From it a road leads throug-h Kawanali to Shahri Babak. {Wells) ABADIH—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,200'. A walled town in Ears, 122 miles south south-east of Isfahan, 116 miles north of Shiraz, 163 miles from Bushahr. Morier says tlm first appearance of Abadih announces a large place, but on a nearer inspec tion the town exhibits only a great extent of ruined walls without inhabitants. The present population lives within a square enclosure one side of which is a strong square fort, with high brick walls, two’ABA—ABA tiers of loopholes, and flanked by well-built towers. It is in form a parallelogram, about 350 yards by 50 yards, wrth two gates counected by a wide street. Part of tbe houses are inside this fort, which rrith the post house and another walled enclosure form three sides of a square, the fourth being filled by the unwalled village. The tele- line from Tihran. to Yazd branches off here. Supplies of all kinds procurable, the locality being particularly noted for fruits. Water plentiful from numerous watercourses. m ^ \ [Morier — Ouseley — Felly — Taylor — Gibbons Trotter.) Mr. Odling, M.R.C.S., says regarding Abadih and its surroundings f( It is situated in a large, fertile, and well-watered plain, on which are numerous villages. The diseases prevalent here are dyspepsia diarrhoea, ophthalmia, syphilis, intermittent fever, eczema, measles, and small-pox, the latter causing many deaths. It has a very good climate, dry and bracing atmosphere, and excellent water. The days are hot in the summer, but the nights are generally cool. The winter is severe but less so than at Bihi Bid (q.v.). One farsakh north-west of Abadih a desert is entered, with no water till Shulgistan is reached, aiound which is cultivation, and the water-supply fair.” (Odliny.)31 ABA—ABD ABAD-I-TASHT—Lat. Long. Elev. A village and sub-district of Ears, north-east of Shiraz. It produces wheat, barley, beans, and opium, as winter sowings; green almonds, pomegranates, and some grapes, as summer sowings.— (Pelly-Ross.) ABANDANAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, which rises in the hills of the Lur tribe of Sagwand, and falls into the Dawarij in the lower part of the small plain of Patak. (Layard.) ABABKUH—Lat. Long. Elev. A scattered village of some 850 houses. It is of some importance, as being the chief village of the Abarkuh sub-division of the Isfahan division of Ears. It lies 36 miles from Yazd, 149 from Shiraz, in the centre of an oasis, surrounded by waste. Supplies and water procurable; fuel scarce. It is celebrated as having been the place of assembly of the adherents of Lutf 'Ali Khan Zand before the last attack of that chief on Shiraz in 1793. {Felly — Malcolm — MacGregor.) ABASABAD—Lat. Long. Elev. A small village of 15 houses in Ardalan on the road between Tabriz and Karmanshah, 244 f miles from the former, 98 miles from the latter. It is 9 miles south of Khasrabad. {Napier.) ABBASAbAD—L at. Long. Elev. A village in Khuzistan pass on the left bank of the Dizful river, near Dizful. It is inhabited by the Bakhtiari tribe, and is celebrated for its gardens and the rich arable land in its vicinity. {Layard.) ABD-AL-HASAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A place between Muhammarah and Hindian in Khuzistan. Water and fuel procurable. [Felly.) ABD-KHtJR—Lat. 29° 53' 33'. Long. 50° 14' 10'. Elev. A small creek on the south coast of the Persian Gulf between Bandar Dilam and Kaid Haidar. It has a depth of 1| fathoms. [Bruchs.) ABDUT—Lat. Long. Elev. 4,200'. A village, almost the only one, in the plain of Dasht-i-Bir be tween the Kotal-i-Dukhtar and Kotal Plrzan, on the high road from Bushahr to Shiraz in Ears, and 13 miles from Kazrun. A few stunted specimens of oaks offer a grateful shade. There are few supplies, good grazing, fuel plentiful; water scanty. [Morier — Monteith — Ouseley — St. John—Mac Gregor.) ABDULA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Pusht-i-kuh sub-division of Yazd some 36 miles south-west of Yazd, and 18 from.Taft village. Cultivation and water. [MacGregor^ ABDULABAD—Lat, Long. Elev. A village near the extremity of the Bahramabad district on the road from Yazd to Karman, 167 miles from the former and 70 from the latter. It has a caravansarai. [Smith—-Gill.)32 AB—AB AB GARMAYA—Lat. Long. Eley. A valley in Khuzistan situate to the north of Masjid-i-Suliman. (Layard.) AB-I-’ALISHTAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, so called from the plain of 'Alishtar, which is a level flat of great extent, bounded east by a noble chain of moun tains named Chihal Na Balighan (40 Infants), vide ^Alishtar, It is a shallow river, forded without difficulty. (Rawlinson.) AB-I-ANJlRAN—(?) Lat. Long.^ Elev. A rivulet between Firuzabad and Fanaihband, Ears. {Ross, 1875.) AB-I-BALARUD—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Khuzistan, which rises in the hills of Mangarah and Shahzada Ahmad, and, after a course of about 40 miles, flows into the river of Dizful, a short distance (5 miles) below that town. At 18 miles from Dizful it is crossed by the Khuramabad—Dizful road, the last halting place being on its banks. In the dry season it is a mere rivulet, containing scarcely a foot's depth of water, but when there is any heavy rain in the hills, it comes down in a torrent of tremendous force. On one occasion, when the Shah of Persia was crossing it with an army, 50 horsemen are said to have been swept away, and the force was delayed on its banks for two days. The bed of this river is covered with pebbles, filled with little fossil shells called Sang-i-Birinj (rice-stone) from their re semblance to grains of rice. These are much in request by Per sians for the heads of their pipes, which are scarcely ever composed of anything else but this stone, set in silver. There was formerly a brick bridge over this river on the road from Khuzistan to Kar- manshah, but it is now destroyed. There are still traces of Alexan der's old road, a stone pavement and the ruins of a 5-arched bridge. A little further down is a modern bridge with one arch, out of the five there were, still standing. {Rawlinson — Schindleri) At 15 miles from Dizful the stream is 100 yards wide, and flows in a bed 50 feet deep, banks steep, of conglomerate; rapids and shallows are numerous in its course, bed of pebbles and large boulders; stony undulations, affording excellent grazing, border the river. It falls into the Ab-i-Dizful, 8 miles south-west of Dizful. {Bell) AB-I-BARlK.—Lat. Long. Elev. A stream in Ears crossed by the road from Zarghun to Shiraz, at 10 miles from the latter. {Ouseley.) AB-I-BlD (ABBUp)-~Lat. Long. Elev. 600'. Khuzistan, exactly midway between Shustar and Dizful, being 18 2 miles from both places. It has a large unfinished castellated building belonging to the IlkhanI of the Bakhtiaris. It contains about 3 families, but supplies are plentiful, and there is a good spring of sweet water. {Wells—Baring.) Bell (1st April 1884) describes it as a very small village with a high-wa led enclosure, the fort of the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris and his winter residence. It lies about 2 miles from the foot of the nearAB^-AB 33 3 range of hills. The fort, or sarai, is of no strength. Temperature in shade, 4 p.m., 78°; barometer, 29' 65'. Average day temperature 82° under canvas; nights cool, with a heavy dew. Some troopers met here en route to Isfahan, which they hoped to reach in 15 days by paths to the north of the Karun river. They expected to be able to ride the whole distance (260 miles), except one stage, over which snow and ice would compel them to leave their horses. Pasture at this season is excellent, covering the plain and its undu lations, which rise 100 feet above it. {Bell.) AB-I-BURS—Lat. Long. Elev. A river rising in the Bakhtiari mountains of Luristan, and formed from the junction of the Karsan and Abigarm rivers, south of Falat, falling into the Karun, a few miles above Susan. At its junction it is almost equal in size to the Karun, being a broad rapid stream, forcing its way through a succession of precipitous ravines, and being only fordable in one or two places with much difficulty during the autumn. It is crossed on the road between Kumishah and Kala Tul in the valley of Burs. Artillery and heavy baggage must be taken across on rafts. {Bayard.) AB-I-DERA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Ardalan, which joins the Hulwan river at a place called Mulla Yakud, about midway between Kasr-i-Shirin and Sar-i-pul. In general, it is a mere brawling rivulet, but, when swollen by rain, becomes a furious rapid torrent. Rawlinson was detained for two days on its bank on one occasion. Even the bridges of woven boughs which are thrown across in several places from bank to bank to afford a passage in case the fords should be impracticable, are swept away at times. At the point of its junction with the Hulwan, it is said to be spanned by a natural arch of rock which is called in consequence Pul-i-Khuda (Clod's bridge). In the narrow valley which opens into the plain of Dera are the winter pasture-grounds of the Kar- manshah stud. This spot has been selected as well on account of its excellent herbage as for the security of its position, shut in be tween the hills on one side and the river on the other, and the horses reared in it are celebrated through Persia. The plain is about 4 miles in length and 2 miles in breadth. It was formerly included in the pashalik of Zohab, but after the conquest of that district by the Persians, it was purchased by the Kalhur chiefs from its Turkish owners. There are 150 resident families of Kalhurs at Dera, and it also affords winter quarters for 400 more, who are nomadic. {Rawlinson.) AB-I-DIZ —Lat. Long. Elev. A stream in Khuzistan flowing south-west through Dizful and Shustar. {Schindler.) AB-I-FAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A small river in Kurdistan on the road between Sakuz and Sulimania, 78 miles from the latter and 47 from the former, close to the vil lage of Halabjik. {Gerard.)34 AB-I-FANl—Lat. Long. . JT A stream in Luristan, rising in the Kuh-i-Dalich, and tailing into the Karkhah river, a few miles south of the Tang-i-Fani (1,530 feet), where it breaks through the Kheolah hills, near the Dizful Khuramabad road. At the ford the bottom is covered with boulders, and fording is difficult; water 2 ft. 6 in. deep ; the bed is 50 feet deep; banks steep, conglomerate. The FanI Gorge, or Tang-i-FanI is difficult; there is no passage through it. Lurs were seen passing over the Kheolah range by climbing up the ledges of rock to the west of gorge. The Ab-i- Fani is also known as the Valmian stream, 11th April 1884. Tempe rature, shade 84°; in sun 105° at 12, noon. {Bell.) AB-I-GANJlR—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Luristan, flowing from north-east to south-west, and supply ing the Turkish border town of Mendali, which pays 120 tumans to the Persian Government for the use thereof. {Plowden.) AB-I-GARGAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A canal which issues from the river Karun, in province Khuzistan, immediately above the town of Shustar. At the point of its separa tion from the main body of the river, a large and massive dam has been thrown across its entrance. This dam in the autumn and sum mer is perfectly dry, and may be traversed on foot, six narrow openings being left for the passage of the water. It is constructed of massive blocks of hewn stone, firmly and closely united. It was repaired by Mahammad 'All Mirza, and has since retained the name of Band-i-Shah- zada (Prince's dam), having been formerly called Band-i-Kaisar (Cmsar's dam). Beyond this dyke the canal flows between very lofty cliffs of sandstone. The rock has been cut through, and although the sandstone is easily excavated and does not offer much resistance, yet this is a very gigantic work. Half a mile beyond this dam is a second, built almost to a level with the cliffs on both sides. It forms a com plete barrier to the water, which, escaping through numerous passages, cut laterally through the rocks, falls in cataracts into the bed beneath. The level of the canal's bed below this dam is considerably lower than above it. A bridge, or communication, is thus formed between Shustar and the village of BoleitI on the opposite side of the Ab-i-Gargar. The massive structure of this dam renders its destruction by the in habitants in case of the approach of an enemy almost impossible, even if some weeks were devoted to the attempt. Beyond this, which is called the Pul Boleiti, the canal flows with a broad and deep stream between steep and lofty banks, till its junction with the Karun at the Band-i-Klr, about 30 miles below Shustar. About 5 miles below Shustar the canal is nearly traversed by a dam called Mahibazan, which, partly natural and partly artificial, prevents the ascent of vessels to the town. Ike cliffs to the right and left of the Ab-i-Gargar are of equal height. This canal is well adapted for steam navigation; its banks are well wooded, its current sluggish, until, as it approaches the hills, the^ current gradually increases, until, at about 2 miles from Shustar, it runs at a rate of about 5 miles an hour; its depth is 10 m 12 to 18 feet in the lowest season, and cannot vary much35 throughout the year, and its breadth from 60 to 120 yards. This ca pability of navigation for steamers extends from Band-i-Kir to the village of Khuramabad, where boats to and from Shustar load or un load ; though Lieutenant Selby ran a steamer to within one mile of the town, where the passage was finally closed by a natural ledge of rocks reaching right across the river, with only a small opening, about 10 yards wide, through which, however, boats of 20 tons can, and do, pass into the very heart of the town, to which therefore troops or goods from England could be transported. Good wood for steam ing purposes is plentiful along the banks and on the small islands in the centre of the stream, but, as the distance between Band-i-Kir and Shustar is so short (only about eight hours), no intermediate wooding station would be necessary. This canal has been mistaken for the main stream of the Karun on account of its greater width and depth, but Layard remarks with reference to this mistake, “ It is difficult to conceive how any person who had examined the entrance of this branch could suppose it to be the natural bed of the stream.” This canal is navigable at all seasons for vessels drawing 6 feet of water. (Champ ain — Layard.) Schindler says the origin of the word is doubtful. It may be a word imitating the sound of the waters gurgling through the tunnels of the dams. One author says it was so called from people having come and settled at Shustar from Gargar in Azarbaijan, and that the quarter of the town they inhabited became called Gargar, and hence the river also. He further describes the construction as given above, adding that the pavement to which the river was raised is called Shadurvan. The present bridge over the Gargar on the dam is of modern construction. Below Band-i-Klr the Gargar is 50 yards wide, and exceedingly deep. Horses and mules swim across the placid stream without difficulty. ( Wells — Schindler.) AB-I-GARIN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, which, joined with the Karsan river, forms—to the south of Falat—the Ab-i-Burs. (Layard.) AB-I-GARM—Lat. Long. Elev. 1,950'. A little stream in Luristan running into the Karkhah river, crossed by the road from Dizful to Zohab, at about 139 miles from the former (Uawlinson). Rivanegra made a stage at the Abigarm, 93^ miles from Khuramabad, and 63 miles from Dizful. No supplies; water plentiful. (Rivanegra.) AB-I-JARGAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Khuzistan, crossed by a bridge 20 miles from Shustar on the road to Mangasht. (Rawlinson.) AB-I-KASHGHAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Luristan, which rises in the Bakhtiari mountains, and flows south-west for over 100 miles to its junction with the Karkhah. It is a deep and impetuous stream and apparently not fordable. It is36 crossed 7 miles from the village of Rabat at a point where it divides into a number of narrow branches by Iliyat bridges of woven boughs. Higher up, on the direct road from Khuramabad to Karmanshab, it is crossed by the Pul-i-Taskau, a magnificent Sassanian bridge now in ruins. (Rawlinson.) AB-I-KATAWAN—Lat, Long. Elev. A stream in Kurdistan, watering the Dasht-i-Katawan valley between Killafee and Astarabad on the road from Sihna to Sulimama._ It flows westwards into the Avroman hills, and eventually joins the Ab-i- Shirwan, or Upper Diala. (T. C. Plowden^) AB-I-LARDAGAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, rising in the Bakhtiari mountains in the province of Luristan in Janiki Sardsir, near the village from which it derives its name. It is fordable in many places, but is generally narrow and deep, with well-wooded banks. With the Ab-i-Burs, it forms the Karun, a few miles above Susan. (Layard.) AB-I-MALAKH—Lat. Long. Elev. A village at the western end of the valley of Dinah, Ears. ( Durand) AB-I-RAMUZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A large stream in Khuzistan, formed by the junction of the waters of the Abiala and Abi Zard (elsewhere described), and which joins the Jarahl on the plain of Ram Hurmuz near the village of Kala Shaikh. Ramuz is an abbreviation of Ram Hurmuz. [Layard) AB-I-RUDlAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A stream in Ears, also called the Ab-i-shur(2) (^.p.), said to come down the Tang-i-Khass from Tang-i-Rudiau, 45 miles north-west of Shiraz on road to Bihbahan. {Baring.) AB-I-SARD—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Tihran district of Ears, 50 miles east of Tihran and near Damavand. It is one of a group of seven fine villages in the fertile valley of Damavand. Supplies and water plentiful. {Stewart — Napier.) AB-I-SARD-—Lat. Long. Elev. 4,670'. A rivulet in Luristan crossed by the road between Dizful and Khuramabad, at about three marches from the latter. {Schindler) It is situated on the eastern side of the Dallch Pass, about 6 feet wide, 17th April, 117 miles from Dizful. The bordering land is swampy; seyeial streams come from the hill-sides ; pasture is good ; stunted oaks grow on the hills. Thermometer 48°, 6 a.m., 18th April. {Bell) AB-I-SHAB Lat. Long. Elev. A liver in the Bihbahan district of Ears, also called the Shir. It is crossed by a ford, 76 miles from Bihbahan on the road to Fabliau, whence it is 25 miles distant. {DeBode.)37 AB-I-SHlRlN—Lat. Long 1 . Elev. A stream of water between Farrashband and Bushkan, Fars. (Ross.) AB-I-SHlRWAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Karmanshah, whieli rises on the north side of the Kuh-i- Sangar, about 40 miles west of Hamadan, nearly as many north-east of Karmanshah and at nearly two degrees east of Sulimania. Its direc tion is west, inclining to north for about 40 miles, then north-west for about 40 more, that is as far as the ruins, and it receives in this part of its course numerous petty streams from the mountains of Shahi and Avroman. About 10 miles beyond Darnah in the same direction, it takes a west course of 20 miles through the mountains to Gundar, where it receives the river of Ab-i-Zemkan which rises near Gahwara in the Guran country at about 70 miles distance towards south-east. Immediately after this increase the Ab-i-Shlrwan forces its way through a narrow gorge (without even sufficient space for a footpath along its bank) into the plain of Semiiam, where it is joined by a considerable affluent, formed by the waters of the Taj Rud and Salm. It now takes a south-west direction, still preserving the same name. Below the junction of the Sulimania river it receives from the Zagros, on the east side, two considerable streams, the first at 35 miles from that junction, and the second at 25 miles further on. The Ab-i-Shirwan now runs nearly south for about 30 miles, when it receives the Hulwan near Khanikin, whence the united waters take the name of Giala (q.v.). On the road between Sulimania and Karmanshah there is a ford at Banah Kalan, which is practicable in summer, but in the winter it is wholly impassable. There was formerly a substantial brick bridge over the river at this point. It is not navigable at any part of its course, but timber is frequently floated down to the Tigris from the mountains of Kurdistan. From near the town of Gundar to the plain of Shirwaneh, this river forms the boundary between Persia and Turkey. It is also called Upper Diala. Its water is unwholesome. (Rawlinson — Jones — T. C. Plowden.) AB-I-SHUR(l)—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Fars, which rises in the mountains of the Mamaseni tribe, and joined with the Ab-i-Shirin, forms the Hindian river. AB-I-SHDR (2)—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Ears, which rises in the snowy mountains of Ardakan to the east and north-east of Kala-I-Safid, and passes through the whole length of the valley of Shab-bivan, winding from east to west. It then forces its way through the hills to the west of Fahlian, and, having joined the river of Bahram, crosses the wild tiacts called Mohar, and discharges its waters into the Persian Gulf at Bandar Rig. It is not fordable everywhere, and the ruins of a bridge over it are still to be seen near Kala Siah.38 AB—AB The river is also called locally the Fahlian, Tang-i-Khast and Tang-i-Radian. Though called “ salt” it is described as quite sweet at Tang-i-Rudian, as at Kala-i-Safid, &amp;c. It gets its name from salt being manufactured on the bank of a tributary of the main stream, the waters of which are highly impregnated with sodium. {Be Bode — JFells.) AB-I-SHtJR (3)—Lat. Long. % . . Elev * A large stream in Khuzistan, which enters the Karun above Loli. It is nearly always fordable unless swollen by rain, when it becomes a most impetuous and dangerous torrent. The water of this stream has a decidedly brackish taste. It is also called the Darav and Murdafil. {Layard.) AB-I-SHUSTAR— A local name given indiscriminately to the rivers Gargar and Shatit {q.v.) in Khuzistan, because they come from a pass by that town. {Schindler.) AB-I-TALH—Lat. Long. Elev. A considerable stream, known also as the Alar, in the Ram Hurmuz plain south of Khuzistan. It runs from Chul-i-Ghul westwards. It is crossed by a ford 4 miles south of Savila on the road from Bihbahan to Shustar, where it runs between high banks. Its name signifies “ Acacia water {BeBode.) ABISTANAH—Lat. Lon?. Elev. Name of a valley in Luristan, inhabited by the Sagwand Lurs. The Khuramabad river, or Kashghan, runs through it, as does also the principal road from Bumjird to Khuramabad. {Schindler.) AB-I-ZAL—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Luristan, which rises high up in the fastnesses of Kala Aspid and Anarahrud, and, after a course of perhaps 50 miles, falls into the Karkhah, 3 miles below the point where it is crossed on the road to Dizful. It is an impetuous mountain torrent, and is filled with immense masses of rock brought down by the strength of the current from the neighbouring mountains ; and the force of the water is at the same time so excessive that accidents frequently occur in crossing. The water is salt from the bed of gypsum which it tra verses: it is, however, of the most pellucid clearness, whence its name from the Arabic Zuldl (pure). A bridge by which Taimur crossed still exists, but the pathway along its banks to it is said to be impassable for artillery. There is a very difficult and dangerous ford, about mile below the bridge, and about miles from the ruined fort of Kala-i-Raza. This river has been confounded by geographers with the river of Dizful, but Rawlinson points out that they are totally different streams, and, moreover, that the Ab-i-Zal is not now, nor ever was, called the Ab-i-Dizful. Rivadeneyia halted on its banks 41 miles from Dizful on the road from Khuramabad at an elevation of 2,020 feet, and Schindler records39 AB—ABN seeing the remains of some one-arched bridges a little above the ford. (Rawlinson — Schindler — Rivadeneyra.) Bell (1884) writes about the Ab-i-zal, which he crossed at 45 miles from Dizful:— a Camp on the left bank of the river Zal. The Sagwand sub-division of the Bajilan tribe of Lurs, Chief HajI 'All Khan, in all about 1,000 families, was encamped here. The Zal is here a rapid stream, 20 feet to 60 feet wide, flowing in a deep valley between perpendicular cliffs of conglomerate, 50 feet to 100 feet high; it was unfordable: a day later, nearer its mouth, it was 2 feet deep and fordable. Its valley is 2 to 3 miles broad. To the north it is bounded by the Kuh-i-Kheolah, or Kailun, a range of barren contorted hills, in parts largely composed of decomposed gypsum; to the south lies the Kuh-i-Kubbed, or Kuh-i-Kablr, a range of barren steep hills, much cut up by deep crevices. A mile south of the camp the Ab-i-Zal falls in to the Saimarra stream. AB-I-ZARD—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, which rises in the mountains of Mangasht near the village Malagai, north of the Ram Hurmuz plain. Pass ing through a difficult gorge, it traverses Abul-Abbas and enters the small plain of Bagh-i-Malik, and is here joined by a small stream, which rises near Kalai Tul. Leaving this plain, it forces its way through the precipitous range of limestone and gypsum hills, and joins the Ab-i-'Ala on the plain of Ram Hurmuz near the village of Manjanik. Its water is of the most exquisite transparency, and is celebrated for its purity throughout the country; near the point of its junction with the Ab-i-'Ala are several bitumen springs. This river varies much in volume; in April it is a rapid torrent, between 2 and 3 feet deep, and about 40 yards in breadth; in the month of May it is said to be often impassable, but towards autumn it becomes again much diminished. It is 20 feet wide at Hud Zard, and turns several mills. {Layard — TFells.) AB-I-ZlZf}B—Lat. Long. Elev.

AESHARS— A tribe of Persians who are spread over Karman, Ears, Luristan, and Khuzistan, and round the lake of Urmia. I have seen no good ac count of them. They are said to be of Turkish origin and to speak a dialect of that language. Morier says their two principat branches are Shamlu and Karklu, and they number 20,000 families. They principally reside in towns and are to be found in great numbers at Abivard, the birthplace of Nadir Shah, who was of the Karklu branch of this tribe, and at Kalat, the place so carefully peopled and strength ened by that conqueror. The Afshars are looked on with great suspi cion by the present dynasty of Persia. They were one of the seven Turkish tribes to whom Shah Ismail Safavl owed much of his success, and to whom, in consequence, he gave the name of Kizil Bash. Napier adds that Shah Ismail Safavl, who brought the clan from Azarbaijan, whither they had emigrated in the track of Tartar traders from the banks of the Jaxartes, settled there in the open valley of the Kibkan, in which are the hamlets of Darband and Kibkan, the first village in the state of Daraghaz. Layard says the tribe of Gunduzlu of Khuzistan is a branch of the Afshar tribe. They were found here by Nadir Shah and compelled by him to return to the north of Persia, but on his death they again went back to their former pastures. Before their deportment by Nadir, the Afshars occupied the greater part of the province of Khuzis tan to the foot of the great chain of mountains, and even the country42 AFZ—AGH now inhabited by the k’ab Arabs, where Dorak was their principal settlement. The Bakhtiarls were confined to the mountains, and the Afshars were generally sufficiently powerful and united to oppose them with success if they ventured into the plain. The Gunduzlu now number 1,500 fighting-men, and acknowledge the supremacy of the Bakhtiari chief. The Afshars are also found round lake Urmia and in the district of Sain Kala in the south-east of the province of Azarbaijan. In the latter their title was disputed by the Chardaori tribe, with whom they are in consequence in a constant state of feud. Sheil, who commanded a regiment of Afshars of Urmia, says they are the wildest and most turbulent lot in Persia, always quarrelling, robbing, and getting drunk. Nevertheless, they had fine physiques, and had the making of very excellent soldiers in them. They have the character in Persia of being officious and loquacious flatterers. Abbott mentions coming across encampments of Afshars at several places on his route from Bam to Shiraz. {Morier — Malcolm — Layard — Shell — Abbott — Napier.) AFZAR'—Lat. Long. Elev.

It has a high mud fort partly in ruins, and chapar khana/ J where the traveller is assigned lodging. It contains only about 300 poor families now, but the adjacent ruins proclaim it to have been a place of more importance in former times, t is said to have existed over 1,000 years, and has many monuments and ancient inscriptions. It lies about 2 miles south of the mountains bounding the south of the plain. It is remarkable for its noble caravansarai and “ dbambdr” built by a merchant of Kasht about 1851; f! 80 ! 1 ?' a lar ^ e ^mg in a hollow under the fort, which is fed from the hills.

It is surrounded by corn-fields and gardens, and there are several other villages at no great distance from it. It has an excellent sarai, but the water is brackish, and but few supplies are procurable. {Clerk — Hardy — Telly — Taylor—St. John — M!acGregor.) AHMADKULWAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A place on the Perso-Turkish frontier, in Kurdistan, distant 13 hours from Gulambar, on the road to Sulimania, Turkey. {Rich.) AHRAM—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Ears, 30 miles east of Bushahr on the Eiruzabad road to Shiraz. It consists of 500 houses inhabited by “ Doweroonees ?” * Or Avroman. 4344 A Hit—AH W « Khuveestanees,” and “ Dehmegoomees (?),” but is a miserable-look- ino- place. Its water is procured from a brackish spring. There is a large date plantation here. A good supply of cattle is piocuiable, as well as fruit, fuel, rice, and coarse felts, it being a, mart for the sale of the produce of the wandering tribes in the vicinity. Near it are some hot and sulphurous springs, which are believed to be very effica- cious for the cure of all diseases by the Persians. From the sulphur, which is procured from them, some gunpowder is manufactured in the village. The springs are so warm that it is with dimculty one can bear one’s hand in them. [Hardy The Bahrami range stretches from the north-east or Ahram to the Kuh-i-Khormuj. . , , St. John says that when the Ahram river is dry or nearly so, as it is from April to December, the pass, 2 miles east of Ahram, is practic able for loaded mules, but during the winter rarely so. Roughly Mon- teith says it could be made passable for guns without much labour. The Persians have never attempted to bring artillery by it. Wheat, barley, and cotton are cultivated, being irrigated by small streams. Supplies are procurable. [Felly—Monieith Haidy Jones—Ballard St. John—Boss—Durand.) A.HRtiMAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village of Ardalan, two days’ march south of Panjwin on the Perso- Turkish frontier, and due west of Sihna. [Gerard.) AHWAZ—Lat. 31° 18' SO''. Long. 49'. Elev. 220'. A small town in Khuzistan, 48 miles south of Shustar, on the left bank of the Karun. It is situated in a flat uncultivated country, and occupies a portion of the site of the old city of Aginis, being built with its materials. It has a mean appeal ance, being a collection of hovels rather than houses. It now contains not more than 600 inhabitants, Arabs, subject to the K’ab Shaikh. Many of the inhabit ants are the owners of the small boats which trade between Muhammarah and Shustar, or are used for the transport of merchandise between these places, as the owners themselves do not trade. In 1881 Baring observed native vessels of 7 tons lying below the third rapid. The country on the town-side of the Karun is a bare plain, with very slight patches of cultivation here and there, and on the south east side of the town is a range of sandstone hills, perfectly bare. The other side of the river is a bare desolate plain without a tree. A few hundred yards above the town is a ridge, round which the river passes, rendering it a very strong position. Here is the celebrated ‘ band’ of Ahwaz, consisting of four ridges of sandstone which cross the Karun here. The first, immediately above the castle and below a large island in the river, has an opening which admits of vessels without any difficulty, and has 9 fathoms of water; the second, which traverses the river below the castle, is the most important of the four; it has two openings, through which the river in the dry season rushes with great impetuosity. The chief channel, which is that near the right bank, has about 9 fathoms of water and is of considerable breadth. The second channel, which is45 AHW—AHW nearly in the centre of the river, is considerably smaller, but has about the same depth of soundings. This ridge of rocks has been taken advantage of in constructing the ‘ band' across the river, the inter stices being filled up with massive masonry, much of which now remains. The third ridge not traversing the river offers no obstacles to the ascent of vessels, and the fourth is of the same description. The river at Ahwaz is between a quarter and half a mile in breadth, and has a continuous channel of above 8 feet deep in the driest season of the year. Layard is of opinion that the ‘ band/ which causes the chief obstruction in the river at Ahwaz, might easily be removed to such an extent as to admit of the passage of steamers and to diminish the velocity of the current. The difficulties of passing this ‘ band * induced Major Estcourt, with the steamer Euphrates, to desist from any further attempt to ascend the river higher, but Lieutenant Selby, of the Indian Navy, with the steamer Assyria, successfully ascended beyond it without much difficulty. There was once a large and flourishing city here, as the numerous ruins in its vicinity testify, and, it is certain, it might again rival its former glory, as, except the Government, nothing is changed. Of the ruins of the ancient city the most worthy of attention are an old bridge and the remains of a palace, on part of the site on which the present village has been erected. That part of the wall of this palace now standing is about 300 feet in length, in some parts 14 feet high, and is built of hewn stone, many pieces being 6 feet long and 3 feet in height. There are, in the vicinity of the ancient city, excavated to a great extent on the west side, where the face of the hill is abrupt, numerous hollows, some in the form of “ sardabs ” and probably used by the former inhabitants as such, whilst others have exactly the shape and dimensions of a coffin. On the occasion of the advance of a British detachment up the Karim in pursuit of the Persian troops from Muhammarah in the war of 1857, the Persians took up a position behind the ridge above the town, but they did not defend it after all. Ahwaz during this war was recommended as a favourable site for a depot in the case of an advance towards Shustar, but it was never used as such in the war of 1857. [Layard — Selby — Wray.) Robertson says about the dam that, in its present condition, it is nearly impassable, except perhaps at great risk for a few weeks in the spring, but that there are so many ways of overcoming the difficulty that it hardly constitutes one. After giving reasons for objecting to the plan of having a channel cut through the soft sand in which the dam is built, and to that of a canal, he concludes by considering the dam enough, and transhipment with all its inconveniences to be the only plan till such time as the trade improves. Baring agrees with him, but considers that traffic could be paitly facilitated by the construction of a steam or even horse tramway, starting from a point below the third rapid, passing round the village. Wells, in a careful report, recommends the digging of a46 AHW—AHW canal, as shown in the accompanying sketch; but the cost would be very considerable, material having to be brought from a distance. The river falls 7 feet altogether; near its left bank are the ruins of a number of mills, one of which is still working. Two of the channels anciently used for irrigation are also visible. [Layard — Felly — Uivaz — Robertson — Baring — Wells.) Bell, who visited Ahwaz on 28th March 1884, writes as follows about this place :— “The village is a poor one, of about 300 to 400 inhabitants; its houses, about 12 feet high, are built of stone or mud, and surrounded by stone walls, 5 feet to 10 feet high ; the floors are low and damp; its roads or passages are narrow. “ The ferry here musters one small boat. “ The Bauwi tribe of Arabs encamp on the right bank, and the Zen- gam on the left bank. “ It is 120 miles from Bihbahan. “Supplies of grain and live-stock are procurable in small quantities; the escort of the prince, here encamped, say 500 men, drew their supplies of grain from Shustar. Fire-wood is very scarce; water obtained from the river is of excellent quality, but muddy at times; grazing good. Three boats, each carrying from 60 to 80 tons, were moored below the river obstructions and laden with grain. Very little traffic was seen on the river, which, at this season of the year, carries a depth sufficient to take gunboats; current rapid (March).” Ahwaz, destroyed towards the end of the 14th century by Timur- lang, ceded its place as chief town of Khuzistan to Shustar, which continued to hold it till 1831-32, when the plague depopulated it. Irizlu! then came into importance, trade taking the line of Amarah on le igris ud Dizful to Khuramabad, the neighbourhood of Shustar being infested by Lur robbers. • 9oE^ ain Y ells &gt; ma( l e a careful survey of the river obstructions in 1881, and reports as follows :— “It will be seen by referring to the sketch that, as the Karun marked p S ^ C0UrSe 18 divided into two Parts by an island j; 1 : T h ! h ™ Ch t0 . the , west ™ a W one-third of the stream, whiLt that to the east takes the other two-thirds.

Were it not for this weir, it is doubtful if the nature of the river would not be entirely different. “ 4. The weir, or series of weirs, at Ahwaz comprise five principal outcrops of sandstone. “5. No. 1 group is perhaps the most formidable; appearing 25 yards below the island, it narrows the river to 300 yards in width, pre senting a double ridge of rock, over which the water roars in times of flood. There are, however, two openings, each of 50 yards in width, in the low wall of rock, and through these the water pours at ordinary times, having a fall of, say, 2 feet 6 inches in a length of 30 yards. “ 6. No. 2 group crosses the river 1,100 yards below No. 1, the river having turned 15 degrees to the west to avoid the numerous rocks which crop out from the left bank, but do not extend right across its bed. Considerable accumulations of silt have collected on the rocks on the left, but they do not join the bank ; water channels have been cut in rock between them and the bank for the purpose of turning mills (vide plan), and their direction marks the course of a considerable flow of water in flood-time. It was along the ridge of group 2 that the ancient band was built, for irrigation purposes, by the Sassanians (?). Remains of this massive structure are still visible, but only high and dry, far out of the present course of the water, which is a rapid stream between depressions in the rock, and im passable for boats. The ancient band was adapted to the configura tion of the rock to the left bank, where the sandstone is high above the river. A loop in the band took in these high rocks, which are pierced by tunnels and sluice channels, for diverting probably the water into canals for irrigating the country.* “The band is about 900 yards across. The cement used is of excel lent quality. “ 7. Between group 1 and group 2 a small ferry boat now plies, but has difficulty in avoiding the shallows and rocks. “ 8. No. 3 group is 200 yards below group 2. It is of low flatfish rock, and causes rapids. By below is meant down-stream. “9. No. 4 group is 200 yards below No. 3; it is of the same character as No. 3. Below this group an island has been formed of silt (marked I 2 on plan), and it divides the river. This island extends down-stream over and beyond group 5. “10. No. 5 group causes rapids in the two branches, formed by the island above mentioned, throughout their whole width. “11. Below group 5 the river is narrowed by rocks to a width of 165 yards. Here it becomes deep, and from this point to its mouth is easily navigable by large boats.f * It would seem that the irrigation canal was not taken out of the river here, but higher up, and that the line marked ‘ c * on the map represents it. Captain Wells describes the band when the river is at its lowest, ?.e., November. In March 18^4 the baud was scarcely visible, and No. 5 rapid, as remarked further on, was barely recognized, t See further on for a modification of this statement.48 AHW-AHW “ 12 . It would, no doubt, not be difficult to blow out passages in tbe abovenamed ridges of sandstone, and leave an uninterrupted way for tbe river; but it is impossible to predict what effect thus letting loose the pent-up water of tbe Upper Karuu would have on the whole bed of the river. “ 13 . I calculate roughly that from the narrows down-stream to the island above group No. 1, the river falls from 8 to 10 feet. It may be conceived what a torrent would flow from No. 1 were a free channel cut for the water from it to the narrows. “ 14. The whole of the rocks, &amp;c., within the present limits of the river banks are liable to be swept by floods. Therefore, supposing a canal were cut in the rock in the direction shown in dotted lines on plan, which would be the least expensive way as regards excavation, yet the difficulty of protecting the lock-gates from damage at the up stream end, and the difficulty and cost of protecting the canal with masonry from being silted up by the spill of the river in flood-time, would, I think, make this plan inadmissible; besides, more than two looks would be required. “ 15. The best plan, in my opinion, would be to dig a canal from the narrows at (A) to the pool above Ahwaz at (B), following the double firm line on plan. Two locks would be required— viz., one at A and one at B ; and, no doubt, sandstone would be met with for the greater part of the length (2,350 yards), yet, once the work executed, these same sandstone walls to the canal would be of the greatest benefit, and would never be a cause of expense, like the banks of most navigable waterways. Again, the sandstone would form excellent walls to the locks, and greatly lessen the cost of their construction, as the locks could be placed wherever the rock was best, and need not necessarily be at A or B. “ 16. Between A and B, along the double firm line shown on plan, there would probably never be more than 35 feet of excavation re quired, even if the canal were to be 8 feet deep [see further on). “17. As a temporary measure, a wharf might be constructed on piles in the pool at A and in the still water below the narrows at B, where native boats are now in the habit of lying, and these two points be connected by means of a tramway, which could be laid with very little labour, the ground being nearly level, and goods tranship ped thus from the lower to the upper river, or vice versa. With this tramway irrigation canals would not be interfered with, if led from either side of the river above No. 1 group; but, even with the locks at work, there would be a very small waste of water, unless the traffic became very great. However, there is enough good ground about Shustar to be developed without irrigating that below the band for many a year.” With reference to Captain Wells* report it should be noted that the Canal project. high ground on which Ahwaz stands is elevated . . from 10 feet to 15 above the country to its east- watd, and runs Horn the point B on plan, round the village and mosque, to rapid No. 3, above the ancient tunnel through the rock. o the eastward of the tunnel runs a low ridge of sandstone. In ex-49 4 AHW-AHW cavating the canal proposed, the deepest cutting required is to the south of point B, and it is judged that to construct it, so that it shafl have a 10 7 depth throughout, below points A and B, the average cut ting would not exceed 20 feet in depth (cutting below B 25 feet). “ It is difficult to estimate the amount of sandstone that would be met with in its excavation ; in places it seemed to have a considerable covering of sand and clay, and that these alternated with it in layers. “To the eastward of Captain Wells' proposed line of canal, not a difficult or costly project, lies, abreast of Ahwaz, a gently undulating and open fertile plain, slopes of 2° and 3°; and below the low sand stone ridge, abreast of No. 3 rapid, a level plain of sand and clay, covered with loose stones. Without doubt a canal, about 100 feet wide, did at one time exist to the eastward of Ahwaz, and perhaps connect ing the river below the rapids, near the point A, with the river some distance above the point B; for, by the indentation of the ground, the luxuriance of the crops grown in it, &amp;c., its line can be clearly traced, and where it cut through the ridge of sandstone, abreast of No. 1 falls, there is still the remains of a bridge of two arches. The low ground between the ruined bridge and the river to the north-westward, no doubt taken advantage of or caused by the canal, enables the lower northern slopes of the hills to be seen from the opposite bank of the river. This line of old canal is marked c C' on plan. “If* right in the above conjecture, it might prove less expensive to re-open this old line of canal to excavating a new one; its line on the accompanying plan shows it to lie a few hundred yards to the east ward of the Ahwaz ridge. “ Again, it would seem that the tunnel, or rather cut, through the rock near No. 3 rapid was in some way connected with a canal either for navigation or irrigation. “ Rapid No. 5 is no formidable obstacle, and in March, when the river was moderately full, was scarcely perceptible. A cheap and feasible project would thei’efore seem to be to run the canal from B, under the high ground on which the village stands, by the cut through the rock south of obstacle No. 2, to a point C, below rapid No. 4, cutting an in-shore channel round No. 5 rapid. This diversion from Captain Wells' line is marked ' A ' on plan. This channel would in no way affect the river up-stream. The lock at C would be well pro tected, and the length of canal be but 1,600 yards, with an average depth of cutting estimated at 20 feet, by no means altogether through rock. To cheaply avoid transhipment is far preferable to a tramway, or the use of transport animals. “ With reference to the defence of Ahwaz should be noted— “I,—the mounds, uneven ground, and ponds about Kot-Abdula; ^ „ &lt;e II,—the limestone ridge abreast of the fort; Defence. „ IU) _ the f ort . “I.—'.Can be taken in reverse by fire from the right bank of the river, and can be readily outflanked on the left bank* * Major Bell was unable to examine the ground as closely as he desired. The prince was encamped, with an escort of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, on the high ground ex tending from the village to No. 3 rapids; and to stroll about the camp was not admissible.50 AHW—A1Y The crest of this ridge, rising 50 to 100 feet, faced on the south by low, open undulations, with slopes of 2° and 3°, forms a strong position facing in that direction. The hills, however, have no depth, and their northern slopes are steep, and beyond them lies a flat culti vated plain, both of which can be taken in reverse by fire from the right hank. The hills break off on the left bank of the river, and do not again rise until about 4 or 5 miles beyond its right bank. “ HI.—The fort occupies the high ground abreast of No. 1 falls. It is a rectangular work of no strength, and practically unflanked, of 200' side, and command of 15 to 18 feet. Its walls are r ° rt ' of stone and mud, and constitute the front walls of a series of barracks built round an open courtyard. The total depth of the barracks is 20 feet ; their roofs are flat, and round them runs a low parapet wall capable of being manned by infantry. The entrance is to the north, and is closed by gates of no strength. For remarks on the political and commercial value of the Karun rivQr, see under Karun. AIGAR—Lat. Long. Elev.

AIWANS—A tribe of Karmanshah, Irak-i-Ajami. The Aiwan country borders on Luristan towards the south, and on the Tur kish town of Mendali to the west. The Aiwans do not furnish any contingent, infantry or other, but pay maliyat to the amount of 2,000 tumans per annum : ’they are cultivators and shepherds, and are armed with old flint guns. Their chiefs are (1881) Zulfilkar and Khan Ahmad Khan, uncle and nephew. The Aiwans control the head-waters of the Ab-i-Ganjlr, which supplies the Turkish town of Mendall; they receive 120 tumans a year from the people of Mendall in return for the use of the water. AIYINAT—-Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Fars, about.9 miles to the south-eastward of Kangun.

A well and grove in Fars; situated on a hill of the same name, near Chambuiaki, north of Shiraz, and sacred to the memory of Job, who is supposed to have been buried here^ together with his wife. The well is a spring of clear water (coming out of the hill), over which a shed has been erected; water passes from thence to a stone cistern a few paces off, about 4 feet deep; this will hold fifty or sixty bathers. It runs thence through the grove of tall trees, sycamores, and others, on the hill-side below the bathing-place. In the grove are to be seen51 encampments of devotees coming to be healed at the sprint*. The tombs of Job and his wife are shown, each under a dark, dirty brick- built shed.

Elev. A village in the district of Kavar, Ears. ( Ross.) AKDAGH—Lat. Long. Elev. A rough tract of mountain in Kurdistan traversed on the caravan route from Tabriz to Karmanshah, between Kizilbulak and Khasrabad. It is formed of very bad white limestone, and the principal elevations, rising to a height of 7,500 feet (above the sea) are precipitous. It rises from the broken plateaux which extend from the watershed line of the Kizil Uzan to the plains of Khamsah and Kasvin, and falls away to the common level, a few miles lower down the course of that river. Hence the worst portion of it, that beyond Kavabulak, may be turned by a line sometimes followed by Persian glens, striking off from Kavabulak eastward to the village of Kushaful, a few miles distant, thence down an easy slope to the Kizil Uzan, and up its open level bed till the caravan road is rejoined near the bridge of Salamata- bad, a detour of about 10 miles. [Napier.) AKHCHALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A hamlet of five houses in Northern Kurdistan, 4 miles south of Saln- kala. [Napier.) AKlLl—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Khuzistan, situated 14 miles north of Shustar. It is situated in the fertile Akkalah plain, 10 miles in breadth, which is described as presenting, as far as the eye could reach, one vast corn field, studded with numerous villages and date and orange gardens. In it are the remains of a very large canal cut from the Karun, which is upwards of 80 yards broad. Modern canals, of great extent and in good repair, intersect the plain and serve to make this one of the most fertile spots in the province. The Karun at this point has been blocked up with a dam to ensure a supply of water to the lands of Akill. The tract contains twelve villages. [Jones — Layard — Rawlinson — Schindler.) A village in Khuzistan near the mountains. The rivers Shurish and Karun meet here. [DeBode.) Bell, 1st April 1884, says the plain is 40 miles long by 10 to 15 broad. It undulates gently, and affords excellent grazing : it is covered with water-worn pebbles, and has no trees. It produces wheat, barley, and Indian-corn; and is celebrated for its good apples. [Belly.) It is a very flourishing place, with extensive gardens, handsome trees, and delightful streams of admirable water. In its vicinity are four forts, in which most of the people reside. [Ouseley.)5&gt; AKK—ALA AKKALAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A valley in Khuzistan, north of Shustar, situated between the first range of hills under which that town is placed, and the second or least where the Karim first emerges from the mountains. It is watered l&gt;v the river of the same name and numerous canals, and presents, as far as the eye can reach, one vast cornfield, studded with villages and date groves and numerous gardens, amongst which orange is the most abundant. There are also the remains of a very large canal leading from the river close to the second range of hills, and which, though centuries must have passed since it was made, is even now above 80 yards broad. Modern canals of great extent and in good repair, with which the whole plain is intersected, serve now to irrigate the country and assist nature in rendering this one of the most fertile spots in the whole province. This valley is about 40 miles long and is from 10 to 15 broad, and from its position receiving all the rich soil washed down from the mountains necessarily most productive; and it is from here that Shustar and a vast extent of adjacent country are supplied with corn of all descriptions.

'ALl ILAHl- , ; . . , ml • A religious sect of Persia who are said to regard Ah as God. their -belief would appear to be an exaggeration of Shiahism, of which the foundation is an excessive devotion to 'All and his descendants. The votaries of this creed are very numerous, though chiefly contined to the genuine Persian tribes of Lak descent. Theyj aie a c s ( ) oun among the Guran Kurds, and around the higher parts of Zagros. Rawlinson considers them to be of Jewish origin, from t eir ea ures having a decided Jewish cast. It is said that their xe igion enjoins that at certain periods they shall congregate at night m a particular spot. At these times the greatest license is said to prevail, an the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes to form part of the ceremonies■ —, AL1—ALL prescribed by their singular creed. It is certain that a more than masonic secrecy is maintained among them in regard to the mystical rites and ceremonies connected with their religion, and that they are exceedingly jealous of curious enquiries on the subject. The 'All Ilahi, says Jones, when journeying in Muhammadan cities, outwardly conform to the ceremonies of the established faith. They also adopt the deportment and dress of their Muhammadan rulers, so as not to excite the prejudices of the fanatic people. This probably is not applicable to the sect in South Turkey, but in Persia. Sheil says that, though their tenets are perfectly well known, not the slightest attempt is made to disturb their opinions, though they do not openly proclaim their dissent from the prevailing religion of the country. The 'All Ilahi in their own villages do not deny themselves the use of wine and spirits, nor do they abstain from the prohibited food of the Kuran; on the contrary they indulge freely both in swine's flesh and intoxicating liquors. (Sheil — Malcolm — Jones — Rawlinson — Chesney.) Saiad Rustam is the name of the present chief priest of the 'All Ilahls, and he lives at Zardah, the sacred place of the sect on Mount Dalahu. The 'All Ilahis have no religious books, and rarely, if ever, pray. They do not keep Ramzan. Ali is invoked by them under the name of Baud, accompanied by a sacrifice of a sheep or some beast. The marriages of this sect are supposed to require the sanc tion of the chief priest, but resort is not unfrequently had to Shiah Mullas. The dead are buried without prayer, but the head of the corpse faces the Kiblah as amongst Mussulmans. On the birth of a child the father and mother give it its name, but if the family is well-to-do, a Saiad is invited to a feast on the seventh day after its birth, and is called on to name it. (T. C. Plowden, 1881.) ALI KUL1KHANI— of .v the K as hk a i section of the Iliyat tribe, numbering about 1,500 families, and inhabiting a tract in Southern Pars from Jereh* to Raidha.

They are under the authority of a Shaikh (chief), who has about 300 horse and 400 foot. They are a all % Karun below Band-i-Kir. They possess large flocks of sheep and 59ANG—ARA 60 There are several wells, the best in a valley j mile north-north-west of the south-east point of the island, and a stream, with good water which, however, becomes dry in the hot weather. It is covered with pits of salt and metallic ores, as also a soft rocky substance resem bling lava; and the hills, which are overspread with shells of oysters and other fish, abound with wild goats, rabbits, and partridges. Between this island and that of Kishm is a most excellent harbour, which, from its admirable situation, was recommended In the year 1800 by Sir John Malcolm to Lord Wellesley as well situated for a settle ment. It is so completely encompassed by these two islands, which are not above 3 miles distant from each other that a ship can anchor close to either shore at all seasons, there being sufficient depth of water to allow of a line of battle-ship lying within half a mile, and small craft within a hundred yards of the shore. No pilot is required, and a vessel of the greatest burthen can always come in and go out with the greatest facility. The following are Bruck's instructions for entering or going through this channel“ Steer in about mid-channel with soundings from 6 to 12 fathoms until you get Ras Khargu north-east by east ^ east, when keep most towards Angar, steering towards Mosque point, which round at a distance of quarter of a mile, having good soundings close to it. After rounding the Mosqjie, keep in mid-channel and steer through when the mosque on Angar bears S. 32 W. true. There is a hard bank with 3 fathoms on it three- fourths over the channel towards Kishm to work through. Do not approach the Angar shore at the entrance nearer than Jrd mile in 5 fathoms, nor the Kishm shore under 5 fathoms, until you get Ras Khaigu, east-north-east, when you may work to a quarter of a mile of either shore until past the Mosque point, when you ought not to come nearer than | mile to Angar or Kishm. The sound at this part is 3 miles wide clear working ground, and from shore to shore.” I here is a telegraph station here, intermediate between Bushahrand Bandar Abbas.

Long. Elev. A name signifying the “land of wanderers.” The province, as at present constituted, includes the mountainous country occupied by the Lur tribes, Feili Wand, Bakhtiarls, &amp;c., as well as Khuzistan or Persian Arabia, properly so called, whose boundaries are roughly the Bakhtiari hills, the river Karkhah,—a line drawn from Hawizah to Muhammarah, the Shatt-ul-Arab from Muhammarah to the sea the Persian Gulf, and the river Hindian. The country between these boundaries, excepting the towns of Shustar and Dizful, and the village of Ramis, whose populations are hybrid, is inhabited by Arabs, either settled in villages or nomadic. Its area is about 10,000 square miles and its present population is estimated at 167,000 souls. Its surface is quite flat, with the excep tion of one narrow, rocky range of hills, varying from 50 feet to 250 feet in height, which runs from north-west to south-east across the middle of it, and a series of undulations which rise gradually towards the Bakhtiari hills. The river Karun, issuing from the hills and becoming navigable at Shustar, bi-sects Persian Arabia. It runs by one mouth into the Persian Gulf, and by another into the Shatt-nl- Arab at Muhammarah. A smaller stream, the Jarahi, entering the plains at Ramis, loses itself in the marshes around Fellahiah. There is, there fore, no lack of water were it utilised, but the dams on the Karun and Jarahi, which diverted their waters by canals all over the countrv, have been swept away, and hardly a trace of any of them, except at Ahwaz, remains, while the canals themselves have been filled up by drifting sand. The soil is exceedingly fertile, and when cultivated and sufficiently watered yields extraordinary crops. But since the K'ab tribe moved their seat of government to Fellahiah, and the canals of Kaban were abandoned, the Kaban became the parched desert it now is, and such crops as are now raised in Persian Arabia depend for water, with few exceptions, on rain or the accidental overflowing of the river. There is still one partially efficient dam on the Karkhah at Nahr Hasham, and subterraneous canals flowing from the Diz irrigate a small portion of the country between that river and the Shateit, as the western branch of the Karun is called from Shushtar to Banandeh. Wheat and barley are grown around the towns and villages, and here and there on the banks of the rivers; and rice is cultivated in the marshy districts of Hawizah and Fellahiah. The date palm is now almost confined to the banks of the Shatt-ul-Arab and the Karun for the last 6 miles of its course. The country was, in 1882, placed under the sway of the Zil-us-Sultan, or Shah’s eldest son, as a distinct province, together with Fars and Karmanshab, ruled from Isfahan. His lieutenant rules from Dizful. The collection of revenue is the chief function performed by the governor, the other matters being left to the discretion of chiefs or governors of the six districts into which Persian Arabia is divided. The six districts are Muhammarah, Fellahiah, Ramis, Shustar, Dizful, (with Kathir Arabs) and Hawizah, having a total population of 167,000 souls, paying a revenue of 172,000 tumans.ARA—AHA The Arabs of Khuzistan are exceptionally intelligent, owing prob ably to contact with Persians. They have adopted various Persian manners and customs, especially on ceremonious occasions, and their dress, with the exception of the head-dress, is often Persian. Persian women, being excellent cooks, are highly esteemed by them as wives. But, although the upper classes mix familiarly and the Arab learns from the Persian, their mutual dislike and contempt are inwardly strong, and between the lower classes the feeling is undisguised. Of the 72 tribes of which the K’ab nation was originally composed some have died out, while others have emigrated to Turkish territoiy. Of others some fragments remain. The Bakhtiaris regularly migrate southwards through the passes in the mountains to the warm plains of Shustar and Dizful. Communications in Arabistan, both by road and water, though fairly practicable, are susceptible of much improvement. There are diffi culties by the former in the numerous small passes, which are, however, of no great magnitude, and in the rivers which frequently intersect the roads. ■ Layard says Arabistan was formerly under the authority of the chief of Hawlzah, who was called Wall of Arabistan, while later the country under his control was much restricted, being confined to the deserts right and left of the Karkhah below Shustar. The country is capable of raising 5,000 men indifferently armed. [Layard — Robertson.) Bell writes as follows regarding Arabistan : “ Shustar and Dizful are under their own Chiefs, together with which Arabistan. the districts of Ahwaz, Ram Hurmuz, and Muhammarah, and the Hawizah, with its in* dependent tribes, form the district of Arabistan, or land of Arabs, rU ^ a w ho ranked as an independent prince. f he province pays a tribute of about 150,000 tumans. In 1878-79 it amounted to 137,000 tumans raised as below. The Dlwan goes to lihran, the Pishkash to the Prince Governor District. Estimated population. : Revenue.

Snow does not remain long in winter, but a dry cold, of considerable intensity, is experienced, and from the aridity of the climate the heat in summer is also very oppressive. Henna is much cultivated in the neighbourhood, and the town has considerable manufactures of the cotton cloth used for the tents of the royal household and carpets checked blue and yellow. {Keith — Abbott — Gibbons.)64 ARD—ARD Is surrounded by high walls of the most flimsy description; has 10,000 inhabitants. {C.

It belongs to the Governor of Ears, and is pleasantly situated by a stream, the waters of which come from Tang-i-Sardab above it. The hill behind Ardakun is celebrated for a soft earth used as hair-wash or soap, called galakdn or gil-i-sarshur. The district of Ardakun consists of that village itself, Barghan (?), and Dalin (?), containing 1,000, 40, and 60 families respectively. Another account states that it is divided into five Mahallatu or parishes. There are also three small tribes of Illyats belonging to it—Khafri, Rais, and Bakar, of 60—70, 30, artd 15 families respectively. These speak a Lur dialect. The Mal-i-diwani is from 1,500 to 1,700 tumans. The poll- tax varies from 1 to 5 tumans— Mules pay Cows Donkeys Walnut-trees Bees (per hive) Young swarms 10 kirans yearly. 1 1 10 shahis yearly. All shopkeepers are taxed at from 10 to 35 kirans. The two nal- bands in the place pay 8 tumans between them. The “earth” above- mentioned only brings in 30 tumaus revenue; 100 tumans, however, are said to go to the agent. Vines untaxed (1878); 2 kirans rent are taken for every 9 square yards of good corn-land, whether sown or not. The measure used is the long lance of 1 kafiz, or 3| zira, in the space of which 2| Ardakun mans can be sown. (A.#.—The kafiz is properly a square measure of 144 cubits.) The village of Ardakun contains eleven masjids and four maktabkhanahs, or schools. {Chesney — Felly — Durand.) ARDAL—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,350' {Mackenzie) ; 5,950' {St. John’s Map) ; 5,970'{Bell).

ARDALAN— A province of Persia, forming the east division of Kurdistan. It is65 200 miles long from the little river Sharuk to the Turkish district of Zohab* and nearly 160 miles in breadth. It is divided from the plain of Hamadan by a small range of hills, and its west boundary is 100 miles beyond Sihna. The capital is situated in latitude 35°12', longi tude 45°. From the river Sharuk, which separates it from Azarbaijan to Sahna, the face of the country is everywhere the same. It presents to the view either progressive clusters of hills heaped, as it were, upon each other, or great table-lands covered with flocks and the tents of the Iliyats. The valleys are narrow strips at the foot of the mountains, where the villages are commonly built in situations which protect the few inhabitants that remain in them from the inclemency of the weather. The soil is good and would yield abundance, but the Kurds prefer a pastoral life. The oihplant is everywhere common, and tobacco is cultivated in small quantities. Wooded mountains, separated by narrow valleys and occasional plains, producing excellent pasture, cover the north portion of Ardalan. The woods yield excellent oak and fine gall apples, the latter of which are chiefly exported to India. The Wall of this district, who is also the principal Kurdish chieftain subject to Persia, maintains feudal state at Sahna. Between Kala Shah KhSni and Kazir Ilias the nature of the country entirely changes, and, instead of a succession of verdant hills, intermixed with deep glens, there are here extensive cultivated plains, bounded by bleak and barren mountains. The Wall of Ardalan claims descent from the celebrated Salah-ud- l)m or Saladin, the famous enemy of the Crusaders. {Malcolm — Kinneir — Chesney.) ARDANA—Lat. Long. Elev. 4,750'.

Ancient Jcanats supply it with brackish water, and it abounds in mulberry, pomegranate, and palm trees, which fill the gardens that extend 2 miles to the north of the town, and almost connect it with two little outlying hamlets. From a distance it looks stately and prosperous, but is really poverty-stricken and stagnant. No trade has taken root here, as the town lies off the main road. It is, however, very healthy. Twenty-six miles from Bafk is what is called its gate. It is the termination of the pass in the descent of the road from Shaitur. The gates consist of sheer walls of rock 400 feet high and 200 yards apart, the passage being a quarter of a mile long. [Stack.) BAFBtT—Lat. Long. Elev.

A plain or district to the south of the Bakhtiari mountains in Khuzistan, Persia, at the source of the Ab-i-Zal, a tributary of the Jarahi or Kurdistan river. It is described as a beautiful and fertile district, with groves of oak and well-cultivated fields, principally of tobacco. In this plain are the ruins of the ancient city of Manga- nik. ( Layard.) On the ruins of the ancient Manganik is the village Bagh-i-Malik. [Schindler — Baring.) The Bagh-i-Malik valley is fertile, and grows excellent rice and wheat. To the east of the valley oaks cease to clothe the hill-sides, and fire wood is most scarce. The village contains 100 families. The ancient name of Bagh-i-Malik is said to have been KaEa-I-Ramis, and to have been built by the Ramis Arabs now occupying the vicinity of Ram il ormuz. The ruins of Manginik and Orwa lie in the valley. The inhabitants of Bagh-i-Malik are descended from the family of Lur-i-Buzurg, living about Karmanshah, i.e., the Zangana. This family has nine branches -—the Garrawand (of these 100 families, living southward from Burujird, are united with the ChahSr Lang), Hazarwand, Salman- wand, Abbaswand, ’Amwand, Gulabwand, Taduwl, Al-i-Kurshid (from this family sprang the Kurshidi Atabegs, who ruled Luristan from 1155 to 1600), and the Gijwand. From Bagh-i-Malik (2,530 feet) to Kalga (1,910 feet) the Zard-Ab or Tund-Ab flows in a narrow valley for 11 miles and falls 620 feet, or, allowing for the windings of the stream, about 41 feet in a mile. The Ab-i-Tund-Ab or Zard-Ab has three sources, i.e., (1) that from KaFa-i-Tul, the Ab-i-Jalal, (2) the Ab-i-Bagh-i-Malik, and (3) the Talkh-Ab-Al-i-Kurshid. [Schindler.) BAGH-I-NARlR—Lat. Long. Elev.

The residence of their chief is Kala ’Ala, near the source of one of the branches of the Jarahl. This tribe has about 2,000 excellent matchlockmen, and a small, but very efficient, body of horsemen. They are the most notorious robbers, and as ignorant and barbarous as any tribe in these mountains. The shedding of blood is carried to a lamentable extent among them ; the life of a man is no more valued than that of a sheep. They are treach erous and deceitful; with them no oath is binding, and no traveller, unless protected in the strongest way, should venture to go amongst them. (Bayard.) Baring says they belong to the Pusht-i-Kuh section of the Kuhgehlu tribe. Their chiefs are Muhammad Hasan Khan and Jatfir Khan. Ross says there are only 1,000 families in the clan, and that they possess 200 mules.

A branch of the Kamn river in Persia, which leaves the Hafar at about 8 miles above Muhammarah, and running south-east on the east side of the island of Abadan falls into the Persian Gulf, 11 miles east of the Shatt-ul-Arab. Its western point is in lat. 30°, long. 48° 38' 50'; its eastern in lat. 29° 59' 30', long. 48° 44' 30'. Its length is about 45 miles, and it joins the sea by a good navigable channel, having in it near the sea from 5 to 7 fathoms, and being about a quarter of a mile wide. Bruchs says that this channel is now blocked up by a dam near the Hafar Canal. Except for this all authorities agree in regarding it as a fine navigable stream, used much by large native boats, in order to get to Muhammarah without entering the Shatt-ul- Arab. The Euphrates steamer went up this river to Muhammarah. In September it is said to have little water in it, not more than 5 or 6 feet in some parts. The water of this river is said to be very wholesome. m Three-fourths of the water of the Karun is discharged through the Hafar canal into the Shatt-ul-Arab, the remainder (i) goes direct to the Persian Gulf by the Bahr-ul-Mashir mouth. The latter carries 7 feet over its worst shallows at low tide, and is about ^ a mile wide. It is now little used, and appears to be becoming shallower yearly. The rise of tide varies between 8 feet and 10 feet. {Bruchs — Chesney — Whitelock — Wray — Holland — Bell.) BAHUSH—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass over the Siah Kuh leading to Kalimeh in Ears. {St. John.)

A village in the Pusht-Kuh district of Yazd. (MacGregor.) BAKHTIARl— A large tribe of Luristan, inhabiting Lur-i-Buzurg, whose country is bounded north by the river Dizful; south by an imaginary line drawn from Dehyur in the plain of Bam Hormuz to Falat near Kumishah, on the opposite side of the mountains ; east they encamp in the imme diate vicinity of Burujird in Earidun .and Chahar Mahal within two days' journey of Isfahan ; to the west they occupy the low hills and the upper part of the plains above Dizful, Shustar, and Ram Hormuz. The Bakhtiari tribes are divided into the Haft Lang and Chahar Lang sec tions. The tradition regarding this tribe is that they originally came from Sham (Syria) under one great chief, and took possession of the mountains which they now inhabit. A descendant of this chief had two wives, to whom he was equally attached. By one he was father of four children, and by the other he had seven. At his death the children of these two families formed the two divisions of four (Chahar) and seven (Haft) branches respectively. A quarrel soon ensued be tween them, and the feud was bequeathed to their posterity. It is certain that from time immemorial the greatest enmity has existed between the Haft Langs and the Chahar Langs, and, although both are known as Bakhtiaris, these tribes seldom intermarry. Their places of winter residence (Garmslr) are now chiefly divided by the Karun; their summer quarters (Sardsir) are not so well distinguished, but the tribes of Haft Lang very rarely encamp near those of the Chahar Lang. Should they approach, much bloodshed is usually the result. The Bakhtiaris are at present under the Governor of Isfahan, the Mutamid- ud-Daulat, with the exception of the tribes of Sallak, Memiwand,78 BAK—BAK The tribes are engaged in constant blood-feuds amongst themselves^ and are, moreover, exposed to the jealousy of the Shah of Persia, should any of them become or appear to be too powerful. When Layard visited these tribes the most powerful chief was Muhammad Taki, and he had more or less command over the following tribes :— Janikx Garmsir Men. . 4,000 „ Sardsir . 2,500 Kiyunurzl . 800 Suhunl . 1,000 Blndun! 500 Moguw! 400 Gunduzlu . . . &gt; . 1,500 Dinarun! . 3,000 Tribes of Ram Hormuz . 1,500 Bahmehi . 2,000 Feili * . 1,500 Total . 18,700 men. Of this number between 5,000 or 6,000 were horsemen, and the whole well armed with muskets and matchlocks. But this number repre sents that which he could have assembled only under the most favour able circumstances; if opposed to other tribes he might possibly have been able to raise 15,000 men, but if opposed to Government he could scarcely have collected more than two-thirds of that number, except in a moment of popular excitement. In calculating the actual force which could be put in the field by the Bakhtiaris, it may be presumed that each family can produce at least one armed man, and indeed each family may be called on by the chief for the services of one person in his wars; but it must be remembered that both for the internal defence of the country and for the actual cultivation of the soil and other necessary labours, a large portion of the male population will &gt;e unable to leave the tents. In the event of an external war, three- fourths of the males between the age of 16 and 60 could probably join le chief. The chiefs of these tribes have large herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, as w 7 ell as many Arab mares and stallions of pure breed with great numbers of horses of mixed breeds* The Bakhtiaris may be considered the most warlike of all the Persian tribes, and their .?y a y ^ . ^hah would seem to depend in a great measure on the personal idiosyncracies of their chiefs and the Shah himself. n ma eis o lehgion they are lax, but still they are outwardly Muhammadans. Their language is a dialect of the Kurdish, but still 1 eilll g in many respects, and more particularly in the mode of pionuncia ion, from any of the other modifications of that tongue, Za^ros^' 6 Sp0ken by the different tribes extending along the range of the no^essLn^nfColonel Ross estimates the number in purposes^ C ri e a 10,000. Special herds of mares are kept for breeding79 BAK—BAK The Bakhtiaris pursue a certain amount of traffic; they exclusively supply Rhuzistan with tobacco from the Janiki; they also export a small quantity of grain; and the Isfahan market is furnished during the summer with mutton almost entirely from the Bakhtiari flocks : the cherry-sticks for pipes, which grow in profusion among their mountains, would also prove to them, if steadily pursued, a most lucrative line of traffic. Charcoal, gallnuts, gum mastic, and the sweet meat called “ gaz ” form the only other exportable articles which their country affords. See also below under “ Bell.'” The Bakhtiaris say they are not of Persian origin. Their language would tend to contradict this last assertion, as it abounds in words of the old Farsi, and has great affinity to that of the Zands. Yet they have several customs which distinguish them from the modern Persians. Their national dance, in particular the Chapi, resembles altogether the Arnaoutika of the modern Greeks, which is generally allowed to be of ancient Greek origin. It is performed by an in definite number of persons, who form themselves into a close front by holding each other fast by the girdle, and then, swinging on sideways, mark the time by stamping the feet, which they alternate ly raise before them, with the toes upwards. They are led by a man who dances independently of the others and who flourishes a handkerchief about in the air, and sings as he dances. Bakhtiar sounds so much like Bactria that this coincidence will bring to mind the Greek colony which was planted by Alexander there, and which DeGuignes says was driven from thence to the westward by the Tartars. At their burials, instead of mourning, they rejoice; for they collect round the grave, where they sing and dance the Chapi to the sound of music. If the person to be buried has been killed in battle they rejoice the more, looking upon his death as ‘ f halal/'* lawful; and should he have died at a distance from his home, they make up a temporary cenotaph, place his cap, his arms, and other effects upon it, and dance and rejoice around it. In Luristan they inhabit villages of about twenty to thirty houses, in difficult nooks of the mountains, wherever they can get water and grass ; some also live in caves. They pretend that they exercise all the hospitality of the wandering tribes; and, as an instance of it, say that among them an old woman would sell herself rather than permit her guest to want food. But other Persians say that they are very unwilling to permit strangers to sojourn amongst them, and are not scrupulous in robbing a passenger of all that he may possess. Their most famous stronghold is about two stages from Dizful, called Diz for shortness, but Diz-i-mian-i-dizu in the Bakhtiari language, or Kala- i-Diz or Diz Shahi (q. v.) and is represented as situated in the centre of a long, narrow defile which it commands. If they had opportunity and assistance, it is likely that they would throw off their allegiance to Per sia ; and the king is so well aware of that that he keeps many families of them in separate villages about Tihran, as hostages for the good beha viour of the rest, and retains 2,000 of them in his pay as Sarbaz. The Bakhtiaris were conquered by Nadir Shah, who afterwards took many80 of them into his service, in which they behaved, especially at tte siege of Kandahar, with extraordinary bravery. {Layard — Malcolm.) After the death of Nadir Shah the tribe became again independent and was unsuccessfully attacked by Aglia Muhammad in 1785 during 1 his struggle with Jafir Khan. Their independence continued till the reio-n of Muhammad Shah, when the Governor of Isfahan attacked and subdued Muhammad Taki Khan and Waki Khan, two formidable chiefs who lived at Kala-i-Tul. These two Khans died prisoners at Tihran. After this the chief authority at Kala-i-Tul was conferred upon 'All Reza Khan, whose sons are still in power. The Governor of Isfahan subsequently defeated Jafir Kuli Khan, whose father, Asad Khan, had successfully defied the Persian Government. The former Ilkhani of the tribe was Husain Kuli Khan, son of Jafir Kuli Khan, grandson of Habib Ullah Khan. The Bakhtiaris were reckoned by this Ilkhani at 150,000 souls (in 1881). The Ilkhani is under the Prince Governor of Isfahan, and receives a salary of 1,000 tumans yearly. The tribe pays 14,000 tumans yearly to Isfahan, and provide £00 horsemen for the Governor. Revenue is collected and taxes are assessed by the Ilkhani only. {Baring.) In 1878 the Ilkhani was fined 30,000 tumans for not restoring plunder which he had retaken from the Bani Lam, who had made a raid near Shustar. {Ross.) The Bakhtiaris are ancient rivals of the Kashkais and claim to have driven the latter out of Chaghakhur, but they seem a poorer and less martial race than the Kashkais. Towards the end of the autumn they migrate southwards through the passes into the warm plains of so called Arabistan, near Shustar and Dizful. They return in the end of spring. The Lur dialect is spoken and is said to be like old Persian. {Stack.) The following more recent (1884) and exhaustive account by Bell gives further information about this tribe :— The Bakhtiari tribes occupy the country bounded on the north by the tributaries of the Ab-i-Dizful and the Zaindarud streams (southern branch); on the south by an imaginary line extending from Deh-i- Yar (Yur or Ur), in the plain of Ram-Hormuz to Felat or Pelart; on the east by an imaginary line from Felat to the valley of the Afhus (north branch of Zaindarud); and on the west by the Ab-i-Dizful and the low range of hills extending from the Kuh-i-Fedelak to Deh-i-Yar. Language. Their language is a dialect of the Persian {see above). They are divided into the Haft Lang, the Chahar Lang, and depen- Organization dencies or tribes not originally occupiers of the mountains. The Haft Lang formerly doubled the number of the Chahar Lang. The original enmity that existed between the Haft Lang and Chahar Lang is losing its intensity with time, and the two tribes are becoming more and more a homogenous people under the Ilkhani. With time also the possibility of revenging a blood-feud with impunity is lessening, and such lawless acts are being confined more and more to the representative of the Shah, who81 6 BAK—BAK may rule at Isfahan, and under whose jurisdiction the tribes come. At the present time apparent peace and amity reign throughout their hills, and good relations exist between their chiefs the IlkhanI and Ilbegi and the Zil-us-Sultau ; bloodshed is punished and feuds repressed. The Chahar Lang occupy the south-east valley of the Zagros range from Dizful and Shustar to the territory of Bihbahan. To their north and north-east lie the Haft Lang. They are under the jurisdiction of the Haft Lang. The Haft Lang are partly under the government of Burujird. We read in Hanway that at the time of the Afghan invasion of .. ,. , Persia, in the beginning of the last century, the Bakhtiarl chief, Kasim Khan, put 12,000 horse into the field. Moving towards Isfahan, he was met and defeated by the invaders with a loss of 2,000 men. Later on the Pasha of Mosul, notwithstanding a first success, was unable to permanently hold the country. The Bakhtiarls who accompanied Nadir Shah to Kandahar distin guished themselves greatly during its siege. The Bakhtiaris in former years often disturbed the peace of Persia; they were conquered by Nadir Shah, but not subdued. In the rei^n of Muhammad Shah, they were first brought under subjection. Still they are not conquered. In the time of Nadir Shah, Rashid, second son of Zaman Khan, in whose family the chieftainship of Chahar Lang has been vested for centuries, held an important post at the Shah's court. On the death of the monarch he fled from the court to his native mountains with a considerable sum of money, by the aid of which his eldest brother, 'Ali Mardan, became a competitor for the throne. Muhammad Taki, who recently enjoyed the chief power among the Bakhtiaris, was descended from Rashid. During the time of his greatest prosperity the tribes acknowledging his authority numbered from 18,000 to 19,000 men, the chief of whom were—Janiki Garmsir, 4,000 men; Janiki Sardsir, 2,500 men; Dinaruni, 3,000 men, &amp;c. The Bahmehis and Teibis, the largest of the Kuhgehlu tribes, whose , chiefs were related to him by marriage, were more under his control than that of the Governor of Bihbahan, and when able joined him in his wars. The chiefs of the Bakhtiari, Kuhgehlu, Kashkai marry, and thus relations are kept up amongst the Lurs, adding much to their political power and cohesion and making common cause. Muhammad Taki could perhaps have collected whom 3,000 to 4,000 were horsemen, if engaged in tribes or with Shustar, Bihbahan or the K'ab Arabs; if opposed to the Government, he could scarcely have collected |rds of that number ; some would be unable to leave their villages, and others would be too much occupied with their own intestine broils. He relied chiefly on the Janiki Garmsir, whose matchlockmen are noted for their personal courage and efficiency. They are also the most peaceable of the Bakhtiaris. and Feili inter whole family of their powers of 15,000 men, of wars with other82 BAK—BAK The villages of Feiidan are partly inhabited by Armenians. Here Muhammad Taki purchased, villages and. acquired others, and en deavoured to encourage agriculture and to settle his lllyats on its fertile soil. Opposed by the Persian Government, his attempt was but partially successful. Its inhabitants are inoffensive, with a fair reputation for courage. They, and a large body of men from Gulpaigan, form the Feridan regiment. The actual personal property of Muhammad Taki was estimated at 1,500 buffaloes, 50 excellent Arab mares) some valued at £250), 500 good K/ab stallions, 500 brood mares, 500 horses of Lur breeds, and about 10,000 sheep and goats; of cash he possessed little. Jealous of his authority over the tribes and his supposed great wealth, the Persian Government broke his power, split up the tribes under various chiefs, and forfeited to the Crown the villages of Feridau. Lured by the most sacred oaths on the Koran, he impru dently gave himself up to the Persians, and never afterwards returned to his hills. After his downfall Jafir Kali Khau, of the Haft Lang tribe of Bakhtiariwand, rose to chief power. At times he was able to assemble 5,000 well-armed and desperate men. His main stronghold is the Diz, 2 days* march from Shustar in a north-east direction, a natural stronghold, 3 miles in circumference, with perpendicular, in accessible sides, well supplied with water and with a few acres of arable land and good pasture. He raised himself to power by a series of most atrocious murders and acts of treachery. With the most determined bravery he defied the Persian power and carried his plundering expeditions to the neigh bourhoods of Karman, Yazd, Shiraz, and even Tihran ; the name of a Bakhtiari sufficed to put to flight the boldest of the peasantry; his followers, the bravest and most barbarous of the tribes, adhered to him so long as he led them to plunder. His following, the Baidar- wand and part of the Duraki tribe, encamped during the winter near the Diz, in Shimbar and Andaku, among the hills of Lali and about Got wand on the Karun. Their summer quarters were in the plains of Bazuft and Chahar- Mahal and the neighbouring mountains. Jafir Kuli Khan built a small fort in Jalakan. He eventually obtained the support of the Persian Government. Next in political importance to Muhammad Taki was Kalb *Ali Khan of the Haft Lang tribe of Duraki, and considered to be the legitimate chief of the Haft Lang. A few subdivisions of the Dinarunis adhered to him. He waged continuous war against Muhammad Taki and Jafir Kuli. His Diz, oi fortress, the Diz-Shahi, near the river Dizful, a day’s journey noith-east of the town (18 miles), is considered to be impreg- nable.

Wars between Bakhtiaris have always been wars of exter mination, quarter being seldom received or offered. He, himself, was a peaceable and trustworthy chief. The anarchy that followed the fall of Muhammad Taki Khan led to the rise of Husain Kull Khan, the son of Jafir Kuli Khan, who began to make his power felt about 1848 during the reign of the present Shah. His chief opponents, the sons and son-in-law of Kalb 'AH Khan, he contrived to remove from the scene, and obtained almost universal supremacy over the tribes. Present history and ad ministration. He ruled the tribes with a strong hand, and his name was respected and feared throughout the hills. He completed the good work commenced by Muhammad Taki, sternly repressed brigandage, and rendered the passage of caravans possible through his hills, a clemency much regret ted by his subjects, who would readily have returned to their old preda tory habits. He was most anxious to open up the Karun route and the road to Isfahan through his hills, offering to Mr. Mackenzie, of the firm of well-known Gulf merchants, the inaugurator of the scheme, to take one-third share in the cost of the steamers (paying money down) ; to provide 100 mules for land transport from Shustar; to give a bond for the safety of caravans ; and to repay losses caused by robbers. The present Ilkhani would seem to take no lively interest in the matter; he avoided the subject, and hinted that the British, under the garb of the merchant, often concealed the dress of the warrior; in deed, the sad fate of his predecessor, Hasan Khan, would naturally cause him to let alone all manner of schemes, whether commercial or political. His power excited the jealousy of the Persians, and being suspected of holding ambitious views he was called to Isfahan by the Zil-us-Sultan, and was there murdered. His eldest son is a captive in Isfahan. It is commonly supposed that he is kept in prison, bound with chains. His younger sons were, I am told, under charge of the present Ilkhani, Imam Kuli Khan, brother of the late Hasan Kuli Khan. Reza Kuli Khan, another brother, is Ilbegi. Muhammad Hasan Kuli Khan, a third brother, is a Sartip in the Persian army. Both the Ilkhani and Ilbegi have several sons; Haji Ibrahim Kuli Khan, son of the latter, is Sirhang of the Bakhtiari horse, and has influence with the tribes. Unlike the Feili Lurs, Kuhgehlu, and the MamasenI, they are united, the majority acknowledging the authority of the Ilkhani. The section living in the vicinity of Burujird does not owe him allegiance. The Ilkhani is subject to the Prince Governor of Isfahan, and receives 1,000 tumans per annum as salary; the Ilbegi receives » salary of 500 tumans. The district of Chahar Mahal is farmed by the Ilkhani, who pays an annual rent for it of 20,000 tumans. The present Ilkhani, Imam Kuli Khan, seems to be beloved by his Ilkhani Imam Kuli subjects and to govern them justly. He sits Kb an, i n darbar daily, and is accessible to all. His 83 6 A'wr BAK—BAK countenance and genial manner indicate a man of a kindly disposition; his manners are simple, yet courteous, and the members of his suite, although rough-looking, are not without a certain polish and refine- ment of manners.

Tea is now held in great estimation throughout Luristan, and no chief of any note will fail to serve it after the Per sian manner, when visited, with imported loaf sugar, and lemons. Many travellers carry a charcoal brazier and brass kettle, suspended from the crupper of the saddle, as well as the universal kalyfin Assuming that the Chahar Lang number 12,000 families, the Haft P„p„l,tion“„d armed Lang 11,000 families, and the dependenoes strength. 15,000 families, there are m all 38,000 fami lies of Bakhtiaris. . ^ Reckoning each family at 5 members, a moderate estimate, the population of the Bakhtiari hills number 190,000 souls, or 11 per square mile, taking the area over which they are scattered to be 17,000 square miles. . ii c i • Assuming that in every two families one man is capable of bearing arms, the number of men that can be raised is 19,000. The Shah can call upon every Iliyat tribe to furnish him with one horseman and two foot soldiers per ten families, i.e., he can raise amongst the Bakhtiaris about 3,800 horse and 7,600 foot soldiers. The arms of the Bakhtiaris and of the Lurs generally consist of long smooth-bore gnns, of Persian manufacture. Arms. Besides the above, slung across his left shoulder, the Lur horseman carries in his holsters a pair of pistols. They are excellent horsemen and skilled in the use of their arms.

No bows and arrows were seen in their possession in 1881. The chiefs carry sporting rifles, guns, and revolvers of the best London make. The harness in their use is serviceable; their bits, in the form ot the letter H, with a circular piece of metal at- orse accoutrements. Cached to the cross bar, are particularly narrow and severe ; their saddles are padded frameworks of wood, serviceable, but uncomfortable to those not accustomed to them. They ride with very short stirrups; the paces preferred are a quick walk (4 to 5 miles an hour) and the gallop. The Bakhtiaris pay a tribute of 20,000 tumans to Isfahan and equip a force of 200 horse. The tribute is collected by the llkhani, who himself receives from the tribe a tax in money and kind on animal and agricultural produce. 8485 the former sells for quantities to meet the place of other At Kala-i-Tul, Mirza Agha Khan, the chief of the Chahar Lan^ and son-in-law of the late IlkhanI, holds jurisdiction under Imam Kuli Khan. It may be assumed that a nomad family pays annually a tax of about 2 tumans. The chief wealth of the tribe consists in sheep, goats, cows, donkeys, and mules; they have only a sufficient number of horses to supply their own wants. Where wood abounds, i.e., in the interior of the mountains south-east and north-west of Ardal, charcoal is burnt for export; rice, the sweetmeatgum mastic, cherry sticks, gall-nuts, tobacco, clarified butter {ghl), and skins are also Flocks and productions. artic , es o£ export They trap the f ox an d musooreh (hind of martin) in winter; the skin of 2 and the latter for 6 to 8 kirans each. Wheat and barley are not grown in sufficient home requirements. Acorn-flour in places takes flours. A good sheep is valued at one to one-and-a half tumans and a lamb at half its price; goats and kids are cheaper, costing 4 to 5 and 3 kirans, according to size. Their women and the Lur women generally weave carpets and yarn; the latter of both sheep and goats' hair ; goats' Tents- hair is used in the manufacture of their tents (also the work of the women), which are generally of a black colour (chadar). They are readily pitched, struck and packed, and so ar ranged in strips and lengths as to be carried by their cows, which are of a small size and are sure-footed hill climbers. These tents are of all sizes; they are high (8 feet to 10 feet in the centre) and long tentes d abri, their length depending on the number of poles, generally placed at dis tances of 10 feet to 12 feet apart. The sides and ends are walled in by wicker-work, made of reeds; by reed screens, the long blanket shed is partitioned off into any number of apartments desired; as a rule, each wife, if a man has several, provides herself with a tent, caipets, &amp;c., &amp;c. A chief, who has many wives, will pitch his camp in the form of an oval, into the centre of which the flocks of sheep, goats, &amp;c., will be driven. In the centre of each is dug a hole for the file. Beds are unknown; quilts are in general use. These tents are poor winter residences; the wind blows through them ; the rain pours through them, and except in fair sunny weat er, their inhabitants have no pleasant time of it. There are but few Arab horses in the country possessed by the chiefs; the hill horses are of mixed breed ; they Kotscs. average 14 hands in height, are sure-footed, and capable of undergoing considerable fatigue; the rate of their walk averages 4 miles an hour; they are ill-shaped; but tew, i any, horses are so suited for the hilly country in which they are ie an the stony and uneven country over which they are woike . air price for a good horse of Lur breed is 120 to 150 rupees. The Lurs are ignorant of horse-breeding, of the goo poin s o a horse, of their treatment in sickness, &amp;c., &amp;c.; the Kas i ’ai ice o86 horses is no longer famous; breeders no sooner reared a good foal than they were compelled to present it to any superior vyho took a fancy to it. Good mares are kept for breeding mules, and in each encampment there is generally one good donkey stallion. Mares are generally rid den, fillies kept, and colts sold. The mules are of excellent quality and carry loads ot 300 lbs., exclu sive of the pad and trappings. The pad in use Mules&gt; cannot be surpassed for excellence; it is 6 inches to 8 inches thick, stuffed with straw and cotton, and worked to fit the shape of the animal. It is raised both in front Pack-animal equipment. ar)( j rearj an( j j n p] aee by breast-piece and breeching, both about 6 inches wide, of stout leather. The loads are fastened together by ropes made of camel's hair and balanced on either side, care being taken to bring the loads to bear high up on the animal's back. Over the load and under the belly is passed a broad surcingle to keep the whole tight and compact. It is made of leather and hair, with iron eyes at both ends, by means of which the ends are fastened together by a rope. The weight of the mule equipment, including the above, and saddle cloth or jhool, head-stall, ropes, nose-bag, &amp;c., &amp;c., is 60 lbs., and its cost 37 to 40 kirans (15 to 16 rupees). The female mule is preferred to the male, she being considered the M stronger and more enduring. Mules are bred from mares; those bred from female donkeys are small and inferior. At the age of two years the males are castrated. The young mule is allowed to graze with the herd until three years of age; it is then either sold or trained to work; the training occupies one year, after which the mule is fit for service. Their stamina and endurance are remarkable, and their sure-footedness extraordinary. When required, they may be taken 60 miles at a stretch. A good mule costs from 100 to 150 rupees; they are not numerous. The best mules are of a short build, small, and well proportioned. An average load for a Persian mule is 260 to 320 lbs. This load he will carry daily a stage of 20 to 25 miles without halts. Rations, 71bs barley and 14 to 20 lbs. chopped straw. Donkeys are numerous, each village or encampment of any size Donkeys possessing from 50 to 100. Every villager has his donkey. They are more numerous in the valleys and plains than in the hills, where their place amongst the Iliyats is taken by cows. They carry loads of 200 lbs., 15 miles daily, for days consecutively, and form the chief minor transport of the country. They also supply its chief military transport when on the move, each regiment being followed by a train of them. The cost of a good donkey is from 16 to 24 rupees. The pad and its trappings resemble those of the mule. The shoe in universal use consists of a thin plate of iron, about li Shoeing. 1° H inches wide, hammered to the shape of the hoof, which it nearly covers, and is fastened on by four or six large-headed nails; they last for about ten weeks.The breed of cows amongst the Feills and Bakhtiarfs is small; the ^ , breed improves eastwards. Among-st the Kuh- geniu some good oxen were seen; the largest and best are bred by the Kashkai. This difference in size is accounted for by the better pasture found in the hills of the latter. Sir H. Rawlinson considers the Bakhtiaiis to be individually brave* Character a crue ^ anc ^ sava 2' e character. They pur sue their blood-feuds with the most inveterate and exterminating spirit* and they consider no oath or obligation in any way binding when it interferes with their thirst of revenge; indeed, the dreadful stories of domestic tragedy which are related* in which whole families have fallen by each other’s hands, are enough to freeze the blood with horror (a son* for instance* having slain his father to obtain the chiefship; another brother having avenged the murder, and so on, till only one individual was left). It is proverbial in Persia that the Bakhtiaris have been obliged to forego altogether the reading of the Fdtihah, or prayer for the dead, for otherwise they would have no other occupation. They are most dexterous and notori ous thieves. Altogether they may be considered the most wild and barbarous of all the inhabitants of Persia. Judging from the ready alacrity with which the Lurs render obedi ence to their Tushmals* or headmen and chiefs, the deference with which they approach such* their quiet and respectful demeanour in darbar and in putting forward a statement or complaint* the general decorum and seemliness observed in their encampments* their general modest behaviour and simplicity when not incited to behave otherwise by those whose authority they obey, it is conjectured that at heart they are not a blood-thirsty, thieving, or rebellious race* but, on the contrary, that their cruelty and blood-shedding is due to ambition, unrestrained by fear of retributive judgment; their thievish propensi ties to a like want of fear and to petty exactions ; and their rebellions to oppression, government exactions, and mis-rule, or rather a total neglect of all rule and of all justice; in fact, to Oriental despotism has been due their lawlessness. It is the cause capable of producing but one effect; it gives no protection to private property, and offers no encouragement to industry. Integrity in Persia leads to ruin. Under a firm and just government there is every reason to believe that they would become tractable and loyal citizens. Contact with the race that rules them causes their general character to resemble that of the Persian* who is notorious for his total disre gard of truth, the fraud with which he conducts ordinary business, his thorough hypocrisy, and his avarice* at the shrine of which detest able vice all feelings of honour and friendship are sacrificed. Although the enemies of each chief are to be found generally amongst those of his own household, yet the majority of the tribesmen have hitherto been remarkably loyal to their tribal representative. The joyous nature and manly freedom of the Bakhtiaris contrast strongly with the sedate bearing of the Arabs, who inhabit the country to the south-west and east of Sliustar.

They are for the most pai’t Deh-Nishins. The Janiki Sardsir are not celebrated for courage or skill as matchlockmen; they have between 500 and 600 good horsemen.

GCnduzlu.— 1,500 families, occupying during the summer the banks of the Ab-i-Gargar and the plain of Mosibena, and in the winter the villages of Boleiti, Baitawand, Turk-i-diz, Mosibena. They originally belonged to the Afshars, a Persian tribe inhabiting the greater part of Khuzistan, and even that now occupied by the K’ab Arabs, the Bakhtiaris being at that time confined to the mountains. They have amongst them a considerable number of expert horsemen, and were in the time of Muhammad Takivery useful in encounters with the Arabs, to whom they are superior in gallantry. There are seven minor tribes chiefly scattered amongst the others. The foregoing estimate is that by Layard, 1846. Sir H. Rawlinson, in 1836, estimated the Bakhtiaris to number 28,000 families only. Their assessment was then 100 katirs (mules), a conventional term denoting a sum of money which is increased or diminished according to the prosperous state of the tribes and the power of the Persian Goverument to exercise authority over them. The value of the katir was then 100 tumans. His table is here given in detail. Layard, estimating the katir, or mule, to equal 120 tumans, gives the total assessment to the Bakhtiaris to equal 15'634 tumans (1846). In 1884 the assessment was stated to be 20,000 tumans ; in addition, they were called upon to furnish and equip a force of 200 horse. BAKHTlGAINr. See DariI-i-Niriz. BAK-I-BALIND—Lat. Long. Elev.

Long. Elev. A division of the Sihna district of Persian Kurdistan, situated to the north-west of Sihna. It is subdivided into four or five smaller divi sions, and is governed by members of the same family, chosen, how ever, by the Wall of Ardalan. The population consists of hill-people and nomad tribes. ( Tlicli — Plowden.) The Banah clan of Kurds inhabit the country from Suj Bulak to Sullmama. Including Maragha, the chief town of the district, which is estimated to have 2,500 houses, and Banah, which has 2,000, there are 40 to 50 large villages on the plain and hill skirts, having an average probably of not less than 150 houses each, which gives a population of 30,000 to 35,000 souls. A description of one of these villages will suffice, for all exist under the same conditions, and are alike undefended. The inhabited por tion of the villages is commonly a mere kernel, enclosed in a mass of vineyards and orchards. Each house forms a portion of a small block, divided off by narrow, ill-paved lanes,—never as much as 20 feet broad, and often less than 10 feet: each has a central court or yard, a high wall and strong gate facing the lane, and high walls on the other three sides: beyond the court is usually a small patch of gardens. Of the better class of houses, a large proportion are two storied, with upper windows looking on to the lane. The walls of all are built of very hard mud. With a double story the elevation is about 20 feet; the lower walls 3 feet thick, upper 2 feet; the roof flat, with six beams of poplar, varying in length from 10 to 15 feet, covered with a thin layer of mud. A parapet wall of mud, bullet-proof, runs round each roof. Such buildings would afford no protection against shot, but would be difficult to fire. Bazar shops cover less ground. The vineyards or orchards or (locally) gardens extend for more than a mile round the larger villages, being thickest on the line of irrigation. They cover from 2 to about 10 acres of ground, are thinly planted, and enclosed by solid mud walls, of 12 feet to 15 feet high, with a single small gate. Narrow lanes and watercourses wind through, and about, them, affording very indifferent communications. Though the height of the garden walls and the thinness of the cover within them detract from their defensive value, they might, with some little labour, be converted into an excellent screen, very difficult to penetrate in the face of even undisciplined opposition. In respect to forage, the tract about Banah and between it and Maragha is fairly supplied with forage. Fuel is plentiful and water easily procured. Carriage in any quantity is not to be found. There are no large droves of camels, and but few mules. (Napier, 1875.) BANAH (Town)-Lat. 35° 59'. Long. 45°54'. Elev. 5,400'. Principal town of above district. It has 600 houses, and is situa e on the bank of a tributary of the river Kalvi. There is a deep ravine on the other side of the town. The Chief of the Banah Kurds lives here. A peak, Arbabat, 3 miles south of town, has its slopes covered with vineyards more than half-way up. Town has aprospeious92 BAN—BAN look, and the Khan's residence is fine and well furnished. From Banah it is 7 hours to Sardasht. There are two roads to Sulimania (50 miles). [Gerard.) Near to Banah the road traverses a mud flat—a depression in the plain some 2 miles in width—that would form a serious obstacle to the passage of guns or wagons. A causeway has been raised across it, which is in process (October 1875) of being paved. This morass—which it really is in winter—may be turned by a long detour over a rough hill skirt. [Napier.) BANAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A small village, 3 or 4 miles to north-west of Kangun, on the coast of Fars. [Constable — Stijfe—Persian Gulf Pilot.') BANARU—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in Khuzistan, on the right bank of the river Dizful. It is celebrated for its gardens and rich arable land. [Layard.) BAN AW AR NAZIR—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Khuzistan, on the right bank of the river Dizful, cele brated for its gardens and rich arable soil. [Layard.) BAND Amir—L at. Long. Elev. A village in the Kulwar district, Ears, north-east of Shiraz. It is a populous place, divided and undermined in several places by dams and subterraneous channels [Jcandts) for supplying wells with water. It takes its name from a dam [band) erected across the river Kur at this point by Azad-ud-Daulat, a former prince, Governor of Fars, and the river is sometimes called by the same name. There is very extensive cultivation of rice in this plain. The Band, which gives its name to both the village and the river, deserves attention, from its being a specimen of the hydraulic art of the Persians. The river over which it is constructed runs in so deep a bed that it is generally useless for the purposes of navigation; and the object of the Band seems to be to give the stream a fresh and stronger impetus, to throw it into a more extensive bed, and thus to distiibute it by minor channels into the adjacent cultivation. The and has been built immediately upon the superior angle of what oiiginally must have been a natural fall, and consists of a straight ridge of thirteen arches: to this bridge the river flows in a slow current; but immediately on passing through the arches it falls abiuptly over the inclined wall. The principal art of the architect must have been exerted in the construction of this wall; and although the whole work is going to decay, yet, considering the body of water which is constantly flowing against it, and the length of time it as existed (not less than seven hundred years), the principle of its construction must be a good one. [Morier — Malcolm — Kinneir — Ouselei/.)93 BAN—BAN The Band Amir is a sluggish muddy stream. This name really only belongs to the lower portion of the river after the junction of the Kur and Pulvan. There is a stone bridge where the Persepolis road from Shiraz crosses the stream. Higher up, the river, which drains every large basin, is much bigger, but it dwindles down to a small stream by the time that it reaches the margin of Lake Niris, into which it flows, being ex hausted by numerous canals and irrigation works, which occur in its course through Marvdasht and Kulwar. ^ ( Ussher — Lovett^) BANDAR-AL-GHAWl (PARS)—An anchorage near Bushahr, with Ras-al-Tabri west to north-west in 6 feet at low water; small native vessels anchor here. [Constable — Stiffe-—Persian Gulf Pilot.) BANDAR DILAM—Lat. 30° 1 / 50.* Long. 50° 12' IS.' Elev. A small port on the Persian Gulf, situated in the bay called Duhat Dilam, 31 miles north-west of Bandar Rig, 62 miles from Bushahr, 67 miles from Bihbahan. It is now only a small trading and fishing village, though once a place of trade belonging to the Dutch, the remains of whose factory are still pointed out. The water here is indifferent, dear, and at a distance of a mile from the town. The inhabitants carry on a slight trade with Basrah and Bahrein. The harbour here is only suitable for boats. The anchorage, however, is good and the roadstead one of the best in the gulf. It is under the government of Bushahr, and is described as a thriving little place of 2,000 inhabitants. The centre part of the town is occupied by a large enclosure or fort, the residence of the Katkhuda. The south part is filled with fishing population, while the northern half is full of traders. The fishermen here, using the drag net, catch great numbers of seyr fish. These they split and dry and send to Basra by sea, and to the villages round on donkeys. The traders import iron, sugar, tea, and cloth from Bu shahr and Kowait, and dates from Basra, and forward them by cara vans to Bihbahan, while they bring down bales of cotton, wool, ghee, dried fruits, and forward them to the Gulf towns. Ophthalmia is the prevailing disease here. There is very little fever and no small-pox. In fact, the town would be very healthy if it were not for ophthalmia, The waters from the wells is good and abundant. The fort is square (lat. highest tower, 30° 3' 14', long. 50° 9' 45*). Half a mile to south of fort are a few trees with a little cultivation. * Lat. of table hill. . 29° 57'58' 1 Nine miles S. E. | E. of Dilam Long. „ . . 50° 17' 36 J is a small *table hill of light colour, with perpendicular sides. It is 165 feet high and visible 14 miles. The coast here is merely a strip of land 10 to 15 feet above the sea, inland of which are swamps extending for miles. At about 1 \ miles north-east of the town is a small fort, near the wells, from wdiich the town is supplied with water. Several forts are visible in the distant plain northward of the table hill. Dilam is the port of the Bihbahan district and much gram, ghi, &amp;c., is exported chiefly to Bushahr and Kowait. Cattle, &amp;c. are obtainable. The inhabitants are chiefly Arabs of the Ubaidullah tribe. Native boats lie £ mile off the town, butBAN—BAN mud flats extending' from ^ to 1 mile from shore render landing difficult. The export of Dilam are as follows :— Wheat and barley, value . 30,000 kirans to Basra, Kowait, and Lingah. These imports go to Bihbahan and Ram Hurmuz. The customs receipts may be from 15,000 to 20,000 kirans per annum on both imports and exports together. (Brucks — Monteith Belly — Colville — Constable — Stiffe — Persian Gulf Pilot.) Ross gives the following weights for Dilam :— For Foreign Articles — 1 man = 760 miscals, or about . 7f lb. For Native Produce — 1 man = 1,160 miscals, or about . Ilf ft. Bell, 1884, classifies it as a small sea-port village of about 200 inhabi tants. Buggalows lie in a creek, grounding at low water. The tide runs out about 1 mile. Anchorage in 2| fathoms, soft mud, is 2| to 2£ off the town. It is sheltered in a shumal, and partially so in a sou 5 -easter. A. village on the coast of Khuzistan, Persian Gulf, west of the Hin- diau, and near Khor Musa, where a branch of the Jarahi finds its way into the sea. It is a miserable place, half in ruins, built on a mound, apparently artificial. The number of permanent inhabitants does not exceed 300 : besides these, there is a small floating population of merchants from the Gulf towns and their agent.

The district of Bandar Mashhur, which previously belonged to Fellahiyah, in 1879 was detached from it, together with several others, and Amir, Abdula of Dih Mula, was appointed chief of the new group on agreeing to pay 12,000 tumans, revenue and pishkash, in addition to the 9,000 tumans already due by him for Dih Mula. {Ross.) BANDAR RlG—Lat. Long. Elev. A small town in Ears, 32 miles north-west of Bushahr and 75 miles south of Bihbahan, situated close to the shores of the Persian Gulf. It is surrounded by a miserable mud wall, flanked with round towers, on which are placed three or four useless guns. This was once the stronghold of the celebrated pirate Mir Mohana, who was once the terror of the Gulf. When the place was taken by the English the fortifications were razed; since which time it has entirely fallen from its ancient importance, though it has continued to be the resi dence of the principal Arab Shaikh on the coast. It contains a hundred houses of Zoab Arabs, and pays a revenue of 1,200 tumans. Grain and animals for slaughter are procurable here, and the water is good from wells. Bandar Rig is very inferior to Bandar Dilam in size and import ance. It imports only for its own wants and for those of its neighbourhood. It is not a port for any route into the interior. Its trade may be somewhat as follows :— Exports. Wheat and barley, 20,000 kirans in value. Wool. . • 10,000 „ Imports. 100 karihs of dates and piece-goods to the value of 10,000 khans also a few miscellaneous articles for home consumption. The gross of the customs derived from this port may be 10,000 kirans. Ross gives the following weights for all goods at Bandar Rig— One man = 995 miscals, or about 19£lb {Monteith — Malcolm — Layard — Jones — Felly) Bell, 1884, says this village is the residence of Khan 'All Khan, whose commodious residence faces the sea, built on a small sand mound. It lies 13 miles north 2 west of Khor Rohillu, and is under the go vernment of Bushahr. It has a small creek, inside which boats lie aground. 95BAN-BAN BAND-I-AHWAZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A dam across the river Kama in Khuzistan. It was built on one of four ledges of sandstone which cross the river at this point for the purpose of keeping up the water to fill the canals for irriga tion purposes. At the west end of it is an opening of about 40 yards broad, and through this (with the exception of the water which finds its way over the small places where the dam is worn by time or broken away) the whole of the river, here about 200 yards broad, rushes witli a tremendous fall and velocity. This dam stayed the further course of the Euphrates, one of the steamers of Colonel Ohesney's expedi tion in 1836, but in March 1842 Lieutenant Selby, of the Indian Navy, in the Assyria, passed safely through and proceeded up the river to within a few miles of S bus tar.

BAND-I-KiR on BANAUDAH (The ancient Asker Mokram) — Lat. 31° 497 Long. Elev. 300'. An Arab village in Khuzistan, at a point of land where the two branches of the Kama river (Kama Proper and Shatait), which separate at Shustar, join together again. The Dizful river also joins the Kama here. There is a ferry over the latter. Layard says the vil lage is walled and contains 600 inhabitants. Robertson (1876) describes it as a collection of mud huts, with 150 inhabitants. Wells, later, states the number to be only 80. The 'Anafigah Arabs, a branch of the Kathlr, encamp here. Band-i-kir was a .dyke whose stones were fastened together by klr, i.e., bitumen. This dyke is said to have been made by Darius. It raised the water of the Gargar (Shatait) here 50 yards wide and veiy deep, for irrigating the country. South of Band-i-kir, as far as Wais, naphtha is found in the neighbourhood ; supplies plentiful. ( Layard — Robertson — Schindler — Baring — Wells — Ross.) BAND-I-KlR—Lat. Long. Elev. It is 23 miles north of Ahwaz. The river here is from 200 feet to 300 feet wide, from bank to bank 300 to 600 yards wide. Banks 20 feet high.

Near the Gulf cotton and rice are the staple productions. Among the fruit-trees are the lemon, orange, pomegranate, and plum; of these the last takes precedence. The whole district is watered by numerous streams, the principal being the Shamsi, Arab, Khanabad, and Kurdistan. The climate is so mild that in January the meadows in the vicinity of the town are covered with the narcissus, appearing spread out like a white sheet several miles in circumference, and diffusing the most delicious fragrance. Mules are bred in the district. {Ross.)

A town in Ears, 1£8 miles west north-west of Shiraz, situated on an extensive plain watered by the Kurdistan river, from the left bank of which it is 3 miles distant. It is a moderate, pleasantly situated town in the middle of an extensive valley, and is 3| miles in circumference, surrounded by a mud wall, flanked with circular towers and bastions. It is, however, almost a heap of ruins, and scarcely contains 4,000 inhabitants. Its bazar is small, and its commerce almost neglected. It has few good houses, the streets are chiefly formed by wretched mud hovels, which are in a state of lamentable dilapidation. All sorts of supplies are here plentiful and cheap. Water is procurable from a small stream, and fuel is abundant. Mules, asses, and horses for baggage are also obtainable. It is the residence of a prince governor, and there are usually a regiment and a few guns stationed here. Its south-east corner is occupied by a castle called Kala Naranj. It is a place of no great strength, but with thick and lofty mud walls, sur rounded by a deep ditch. Its interior is small and confined, and not capable of containing any number of troops. It is defended by five or six rusty cannons, and might successfully resist the attack of un disciplined troops. The plain of Bihbahan is very fertile, being a rich alluvial deposit, well suited for general cultivation, and watered at its west extremity by the Kurdistan river. It is about 7 miles from the north mountains and 18 miles from the Zaitun hills, and is between 21 to 25 miles in length. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain. In the town of Bihbahan there are two parties, the Bihbahanis and the Kanawatis. {Jones — Layard — Monteith — Stocqueler.) Wells says “ The town has practically no walls. The population is between 4,000 and 5,000; it seems thinly peopled and tumble-down, yet clean. The water is poor ; water has to be stored in dbambars, or subterranean chambers, for summer use. The Nasir-ul-Mulk, who is Governor of Bihbahan, has a beautiful garden.” {Wells.) Ross gives the following weights for Bihbahan : For foreign goods— 1 Tabriz man = 760 miskals, or about 65 lbs. For native produce — 1 man = 850 miskals, or about 8^- lbs. BIJANlBAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

' Long. ? lev ^ . , , A town of 1,000 houses, the capital of the district of Gams between Azarbaijan and|Karmanshah. It is curiously situated in a hoi ow, surrounded by barren peaks, rising at several points to a 011 1,000 feet. It has no defences, save a weak wall, enclosed, but not effectively screened, by gardens. The 5,000 or 6,000 inhabitants are occupied chiefly in agriculture. Save a few carpets nothing is manu ac-106 BIL—BIN tured. The hi^h elevation of the site of the town entails the disadvantages of rigorous winter and a scanty water-supply ; it was, no doubt, selected when the level fertile banks of the Kizil Uzan were trampled by hostile bands of Tartars or Kurds. The villages of Bijar are usually without gardens and stand in the centre of extensive tracts of plateau, land ploughed for corn. The quantity of land owned by the village is so extensive that a crop is grown only every third year on the same land. The average yield of wheat on such lands is calculated at five-fold. Ordinarily the gross products of the land are said not to exceed the local requirements; but after a good season, such as in 1875, a considerable surplus would be available. In November 1875 the price of wheat was Bs. 4 per kharwar of about 6001bs. The price of barley was -fths that of wheat. The only exportable product of the district is sheep, which are kept in large flocks on the upland pastures and the wastes surrounding the cultivated lands. Fuel is rather scarce. (Napier.)

Bushahr is situated at the north extremity of a low sandy peninsula, about 11 miles long and 3| miles broad. It is washed on the west by the sea, which, after encircling its north point, turns towards the east and forms a deep bay. Thus, the town is surrounded on all sides by water except the south. Formerly, at the equinoctial tides, the sea rose so high as to isolate the town ; but latterly this has not occurred, although frequently the water approaches within a few hundred yards of the town on the land-side, giving it an almost insular appearance. The portion of land which forms the peninsula has been reclaimed from the sea; the soil is fine sand and mud, with a rocky base of sandstone, mixed with innumerable shells of so soft a nature as to crumble under the slightest blow into fine dust. Its seaward aspect is somewhat elevated and rocky, and from the constant action of the tides and the soft nature of the stones, it is hollowed into innumerable grotesque shapes. The aspect of the town from the south. and the outer anchorage ground is rather pretty, the square buildings erected on the top of the houses, for the purpose of conveying wind into the apartments below * Lat. 28°59' T\ Long. 50 °49'24', Residency Flag Staff.

The wall encloses a larger space than is occupied by houses, and the south side of the town is a mass of ruins now unenclosed, which were an addition made to the town at some former period. The wall is only -visible from the plain, and is about 30 feet high and 5 or 6 feet thick. It has the towers mentioned above and two gates. The streets are exceedingly narrow, in some places not wide enough to permit a single donkey to pass ; they are without arrangement or order, passing and winding round the various dwellings in a most con fused manner, and are unpaved and dirty to an extreme. They are extremely dusty from the constant decomposition of the soft sandstone of which the houses are constructed, and, notwithstanding their narrowness, the walls on either side are so low that they do not keep the sun off the people passing to and fro, and, as there is no sub or surface drainage, every nuisance that should be removed by such means is allowed to accumulate in the streets, to be dissipated by the agency of the suiUs rays, and from the complete want of sanitary measures, the emanations from the streets are beyond belief offensive. The houses are built of conglomerate stohe, composed of fragments of marine shells and coral reef, of a light specific gravity and friable texture, easily formed into building material. It is obtained a mile or so from the walls of the town, and forms the principal bulk of which the peninsula is formed. The better class of houses are often lofty, simple in their architecture, and without ornament of any de scription. These usually have wind towers, rising 15 or 20 feet above, the tops being open on all sides to catch and convey into the rooms below the slightest breath of wind. The number, however, of good, or even tolerably comfortable, houses is very few : perhaps there could not be found a dozen in the town. Inside the space occupied by the town are a number of ruins and date tree huts, the residence of stran gers, slaves, and the poorer inhabitants. The best houses are generally built towards the sea, and near that part of the town which is built towards the inlet of the sea are two stone piers, close to which boats of 100 and 200 “candies” can load and unload ; and in the' immediate vicinity of these are several extensive warehouses and a caravansarSi, in which the chief mercantile transactions of the port are conducted. The bazars, which are of considerable extent, run in a direction east and west, are covered in, and exhibit an excellent appearance, and much regularity pervades them ; the various vendors of different merchandize and manufactures having each their portion of the bazar allotted to them. There are said to be about 500 date huts, two mosques, a few baths, a caravansarai, and an Armenian church. The British Residency at Bushahr is a large and convenient building, surrounded by a wall and situated at the south extremity of the town close to the beach. The population of the town fluctuates considerably, and is variously137 estimated from 10,000 to 15,000, but it is probably about 12,000 in quiet and prosperous times. These are a mixed race between the Persian and Arab, possessing- in common the characteristic features and manners of both intimately blended. Stack (1882) says— “ Bushahr is the best-built town on the Persian coast and shows some signs of care and improvement. A good sea-wall runs along a great part of its seaward face, and there are small stone quays where a buggalow of 60 or 80 tons can lie and discharge cargo. It is said that an expenditure of £50,000 would enable large ships to approach much nearer to the shore than is possible at present. Long sandy flats and banks extend nearly 3 miles to sea; but, when the tide is out, one can distinguish a channel winding among them, which needs only dredg ing to make it practicable. Under proper management, Bushahr might be made a place of considerable trade. The custom's duties have been increasing of late years, and are now valued at 60,000 tumans (about £24,000) a year; but the want of a good road to Shiraz prevents Bushahr from assuming the place it is entitled to as a principal feeder of Persia. “ Bushahr is garrisoned by two companies of infantry and a battery. The artillery consists of eight bronze field-guns, very dirty, and four carronades, or mortars. “ The town has been encompassed by a wall, which, however, has dis appeared on the seaward side, and is vanishing on the landward side also. The Residency buildings are situated at the eastern end of the town, close by the beach. “ The water supply of Bushahr is very bad indeed. There is none at all inside the walls ; all has to be brought from outside. It is found at a depth of 12 feet all over the plain ; but, in general, is brackish, though in many places, particularly near the date groves, it is perfectly pure. The wells which supply the inhabitants of Bushahr are on a slight rising-ground, 2 miles south-east of the town, and there the water is very brackish and has a purgative effect on all strangers, though after a time this power is lost, and then only at the springs is its taste recognised to be different from pure water. It is not uncom mon to have to dig 30 feet in some places before water is reached, three layers of soft stone being passed through. The quantity, however, is unlimited. The price of water in Bushahr ranges from 10 to 25 kirans per donkey-load according to the quality. A force landing on the peninsula in presence of an enemy could obtain sufficient water for immediate wants from the island of Karak. Water of good quality and sufficient quantity for a large force is to be found at the village of Jufra, 1^ miles south of the town/'’ Captain Wray, who accompanied the expeditionary force in 1857, considers Bushahr to be in a very strong position ; its rear rests on a perpendicular scarp towards the sea, its right front and rear faces a high thick rampart, covered by a deep ditch. It was then out of order, but a little trouble would have rendered it very strong. It is acces sible in almost every part by severe climbing, but it could be scarped anywhere, and a few hundred Europeans or sepoys with guns could138 BUS—BUS hold it against any force.” However, Captain Jones, of the Indian Navy, takes a different view : “ Mat and date-constructed huts,” he says, intermixed with mud and rubble tenements and warehouses seem to invite combustion, while the absence of fresh water within the walls renders it untenable for any length of time, with an enemy separating it from its supply of this element, drawn daily from the wells situated about to 3 miles south on the peninsula leading to Halllah Bay. The northern spit of this peninsula forms the site of Bushahr, surrounded on three sides by the sea, the fourth to the south being a swampy neck of land only about half a mile in extent. Directly across this neck from sea to sea, a crenellated wall of no strength with loop-holed towers defends the town on the land-side. In the centre of this is the main and only gate, defended by two rusty iron guns, and commanded by three or four others from an outwork abutting from the wall at about 300 yards on the west. The Chapar Burj, or citadel, containing the governors residence, the prison and the public offices, stands at the eastern extremity of this wall on the land, or backwater, side of the peninsula. Here the tower or flagstaff, and three or four field-pieces at its foot, constitute the extent of the defences in this quarter. “ On the west, or sea-face, of the town, a recently erected curtain wall, connecting a series of circular rubble bastions forms but a weak barrier against attack on this side; similar bastions, as yet unconnected, but standing as isolated towers, turn the north-west point and extend on the harbour face as far as its junction with the Chapar Burj. Each alternate bastion has from one to two field-pieces mounted on ricketty carriages. A powder magazine, for convenient explosion, holds a some what conspicuous position in the most frequented quarter. This is the whole system of defence.” When the British expeditionary force was about to appear before Bushahr, the garrison consisted of 1,100 men of the Nahavand and Karadagh regiments, and a company of Azarbaljan artillery and six field-pieces. In addition to these Captain Jones was of opinion that 2,000 of the townspeople might be reckoned on to aid the defence. “Such,” he goes on to say, “are the chief physical obstacles to encounter on landing at Bushahr, and light enough they must be deemed in comparison with the means at the disposal of European governments. The town, however, is better defended from direct attack by the shallows which will not admit of the approach of heavy ships. It is these natural obstructions to an enemy which cause confidence to the Bushahr people. To undeceive them, therefore, it is only necessary to send a small steam flotilla of heavy guns, mortars, and rocket boats, none of which should draw above 8 feet of water. Thus, a bombardment would be effective, and a cannonade of two hours at most would either cause it to capitulate, or it might easily be stormed on two points and carried without further delay. A more dilatory and less certain plan would be to use the ordinary boats of a squadron, but, small as the calibre of the guns of these are and subject as they would be to the pitching and rollino- motion of such frail vessels, even in a slight ripple, the aim would be imperfect, and immediate success might be anything but complete.139 It should be remarked, too, that there are positions where gun vessels can enfilade the whole line of sea and harbour bastions without exposing themselves to the fire of more than a gun or two at a time, and from judiciously selected sites the land wall and peninsula raked by a cross fire of grape and canister, ingress or egress to and from the town might be effectually prevented. Thus cut off from fresh water, from support and from retreat, the garrison would be wise to surrender without striking a blow.” The anchorage of Bushahr is in a road formed by two hanks 2| miles off the town, having from 4 to 2^ fathoms at low water; soft muddy bottom. The following directions will conduct a ship into the roads should she not be able to obtain a pilot; but Brucks recommends a pilot being always taken :— “A ship coming from the northerly wind should stand along the bank extending off B-ohilla Point in a line of 4 fathoms, until she gets the flagstaff to bear north 77° east, shipping in the inner roads north 41° east, or the Old House or Sand Island north 47° east (in doing which you will cross over hard sand), until the flagstaff bears east, Old House north 46° east, shipping north 39° east. (In crossing the hard sand, should a vessel decrease her water to less than 21 fathoms, she should bear away more for the town, and haul up immediately she increases that depth.) When the above bearings are on, haul up north 19° east, carrying soundings from 2f fathoms, until the flagstaff bears south 45° east. Old House north 60° east, shipping north 62° east. You may then, with the ebb-tide, bear away for the shipping, keeping a good look-out for the point of the reef, which is nearly dry at low water; but should the flood be running, it would be advisable for a vessel to keep up about three-quarters of a point to windward of the shipping, and bear away when the point is abreast of her. “A ship coming from the southward with a southerly breeze, may stand along the low land in a line of 3| or 4 fathoms, until the flagstaff bears north 37° east, shipping north 12° east, house on Shaikh Shaad north 28° east; then bear away north 4° east, until the flagstaff bears south 36° east, shipping north 52° east. Old House north 51° east. (In standing along this course, a ship will decrease her soundings at low water to 2| fathoms, then increase to 4| fathoms with the above bearings on). She may then haul up for the shipping. “The marks for the shipping in the inner roads are given in case of it being too hazy to see the Old House on the northern end of Shaikh Shaad Island. “Anchorage bearings—Flagstaff south 16° east, house on Shaad north 51° east, eastern part of the tower south 25° east. Variation in 1827, 4° 12' west ” Down to a period of recent date, Bushahr was, like other ports along the coast, governed by its own Shaikhs. Eventually the Bus- hahris fell out with the neighbouring tribes of the Dashtis and Tangistanis. Persia availed herself of the dissension to press onBUS—BUS Daring; the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57 the troops under Gene ral Havelock landed at Raslrir, and Bushahr after receiving- a few shells surrendered. The camp of the force was then pitched about miles due south of the gate of Bushahr. {Malcolm — Morier — Ouseley— Kinneir — Bruchs — Hennell — Jones — Winchester — MacAlister — Wray —Belly) Bushahr is in telegraphic communication with Shiraz and Isfahan ; also with Karachi, the intermediate stations being Angam, Jashk, Gwadar (submarine from Bushahr to Jashk, land line from Jashk to Karachi). Steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Com pany leave Basra fortnightly for London calling at Bushahr every second Wednesday and calling at Karachi. Extracts from reports of Surgeon Waters, Residency, Bushahr, 1873-74. Town is not elevated more than 20 feet above sea level, centre being lowest, and Armenian quarter in north corner, highest ground. Houses are flat-roofed and closely-packed together; generally not less than two storeys in height, the ground-floor being solely for winter resi dence, and the upper apartments for use in the hot months of the sum mer and autumn. Sewage pits are dug in the street, which is generally not more than 7 or 8 feet wide. Town does not cover an area of more than half a mile square. Twelve different places of sepulture within the walls. Graves not more than 3 feet deep, and some temporary erections of stone or lime, above the surface, for purpose of holding bodies to be conveyed to Kar bala. These bodies often become exposed. The wells are all brackish. At south-east corner is a large tank, gift of a native merchant, for collecting rain-water. This reservoir is open only during April and May, which period is coincident with annual advent of guineaworm (to be referred to hereafter). Chief supply of drinking water is from two wells, one at Bahmane, 6 miles from the town, the other at Bagh-i-Mulla, 5 miles. Only slightly brackish, but causes griping, &amp;c., during first month of use. During wet weather locomotion on the plain between the city and cultivated land is difficult from mud aud pools of water. The first 200 yards or so of this plain, from the city gate, being near the barracks, is generally resorted to as a necessary by the Persian troops. Covered with filth and dead dogs, mules, &amp;c. (see forward). Subsoil of plain for first 20 feet or so is very porous conglomerate rock containing a quantity of small shells. Beneath this is found a thick bed of firm moist clay. Nevertheless Bushahr is not a very unhealthy place. Has a good natural position. Prevalent wind is north-west, which, coming across the gulf, becomes deprived by oxi dation of deleterious substances it may have previously contained, neutralizes the emanations from the sewage pits, cess, pools, &amp;e. Sickness, chiefly malarious fever, is increased during the south-east winds, doubtless owing to the malaria being carried from what is called the Mashila, a marsh upwards of 3 miles in length, which connects the peninsula with the country proper. * 143 *BUS—BUS 144 The rainfall of an average year is about 9 inches, and falls almost exclusively during two separate periods :—the first, October, Novem ber, December, and January, and the second or l&amp;ttev vain, in the end of February, March, and the beginning of April. Probably January is the rainiest month in the year, whilst in June, July, and August it is rare to have even a few drops. Snow very seldom falls at Bushahr, and a hail shower not more than once a year. Maxi mum temperature seldom exceeds 95°F., in the shade, and the mini mum rarely falls below 47°. The cold weather is often introduced by dust-storms. The inhabitants of Bushahr, like Persians in general, are a fine, tall, muscular race. Formerly they were more Arab than Persian, and the customs of the people, as well as the patois used colloquially, can thus be explained, though at present the Persian element largely predomi nates. The people are keen of intellect, shrewd in business, in manner graceful, in intercourse with others and amongst themselves pleasing and polite, but not to be relied on, lax in morals and ungrateful. The latter qualities are due in a great measure to long misrule. _ Dr. Waters wrote a report to the Political Resident regarding the sanitary condition of a Persian regiment quartered in the barracks before re ferred to. The following are extracts :— “The regiment, 700 strong, arrived at Bushahr 11 months ago, since which date over 200 have died, chiefly from intermittent fever. At the time of my visit about 200 men fit for service were drawn up in line, in the barrack area, whilst I made the circuit of the quarters. “ Barracks .—Each apartment, estimated roughly, contains only about 1,600 cubic feet of space, is badly ventilated, destitute of all comfort, and wears a most ruinous aspect. In each, with one or two exceptions, I observed from two to nine suffering from fever, on which in many cases dysentery had supervened. Many of the sick were in the last stage of prostration, and I fear beyond a possibility of recovery, being utterly uncared for as regards medical assistance, food, nursing, and clothing. In some rooms the emanations from the sick and dying were more than sickening. At night no less than 25 men are huddled up in each room, containing not more than 130 square feet of super ficial space ,~ the unaffected, sick, and dying were all mixed. “ I was informed that about 100 men (in addition to the 200) were scattered through the town unaffected, 160 invalids were seen altogether in a state of squalor, dirt, and misery that defied descrip tion, terribly overcrowded, badly fed, their bodies only partially covered, and that with rags, and the vicinity of the barracks thickly inter spersed with ordure.” For further medical opinion regarding sanitary points of the neigh bourhood see “ Dalaki.” English mercantile transactions are conducted in a great measure through the agency of Armenians. There are also a few Jews, but they are a disreputable lot. The inhabitants have the reputation of being extremely uncivil to strangers, looking down on all in compari son to themselves.145 10 The average daily hire of artisans and laborers at Bushahr is— Mason (Head) Bricklayer ....

Mules and asses are the principal animals of burthen ; the rocky nature of the road to Shiraz and other places in the interior is such that camels are very nearly useless. Horses of size and bone are brought up in great numbers hither annually and exported to India. Those bred in the “Dashtistan ” have a great deal of the Arab blood in them, and great care is taken in rearing them. Their average price is from Its. 250 to 400, and vessels take them to Bombay for Us. 40 or 50 a head. The price of a good mule varies from Rs. 80 to 150, that of asses from Rs. 30 to 50, those from the island of Bahrain, which are of superior size and more endurance than the common ass, are fre quently sold as high as Rs. 100; of course, however, if the passes to the north were occupied by an enemy, animals could not be brought down in large numbers.

Rice from Shiraz and India is always obtainable, and the more common grains, such as bajra, are abundant. Bullocks and sheep are of good quality, though small. The fowls of Bushahr are famous for their size and delicacy of their flesh. Vegetables, viz., onions, sweet potatoes, common potatoes, brinjals, carrots, beetroots, and radish are grown in the vicinity, and fruit is brought from the villages of the plain, the plains beyond, and among the mountains in such plenty as to be sold for a mere trifle: they are the black grape, the common grape, musk, and water-melon, occasionally the Isfahan melon, plums, pomegranates, dates, peaches, pears, quinces, sweet limes, and oranges. Dried cherries, plums, and grapes, almonds, walnuts, figs, pistachio nuts, &amp;c., are sold in the bazar and exported in great quantities annually. The supply of fish in the market is not abundant and cannot be calculated on. The following is a table of weights used in the Bushahr market for edibles of every description, including fodder, &amp;e.

For the revenue system throughout is one of farming, the terms of the annual con tracts remaining a constant quantity, while it is only the douceur that varies.” The revenues of the Bushahr Government then are farmed for a gross amount of some 30,000 tumans, of which 15,000 tumans may represent the customs* and the balance octroi receipts, and land and poll-tax from the tribes and villagers. Suppose the Governor to clear 10,000 tumans in the year, and 5,000 tumans more to stick to the fingers of underlings. Take the low rates of 5 per cent, (being that of the most favoured foreign nation) as an average custom due on both exports and imports, and the gross value of the entire trade of Bushahr, so estimated, would amount to tumans 900,000, or about £450,000 sterling. Trade reaches Bushahr from Batavia, Mauritius, and in part from India in square-rigged vessels. But, perhaps, the bulk of the Indian trade comes in native craft of from 100 to 200 tons burthen. * The customa are said now (1881) to be equal to 60,000 tomans yearly. (Stack ) 154155 A small portion of the imports are subsequently re-exported to other Gulf ports in a smaller class of sea-going native craft. But the large bulk of it finds its way into the interior of Persia by mule caravan. After reaching Shiraz it divides; a part passing to Yazd, and the re mainder to Isfahan, with a sprinkling round these cities.'” The physical disadvantages of Bushahr as a port are considerable. It is a roadstead, only partially protected against the prevailing winds from the north-west. The anchorage is 4 miles from the landing- place. Communication with shipping by boat is always slow, either to or from the landing-place, and is sometimes wholly cut off for days together during a strong nor’-wester. The port enjoys a management differing from ours. Boats cannot go off after sunset, nor move to land cargo until the manifest has been seen by the Governor. English trade is rated, under treaty, in and out, at 5 per cent, without further inland demand. But native trade loses on the import, as compared with ours, and, perhaps, in some articles gains on the export, e.y., on exportation of corn. “ The climate of Bushahr,” remarks Dr. McAlister, “ is almost in supportable, and notwithstanding the prevalence of north-west winds the heat is generally higher than in any other port with which I am acquainted. I have been cruising in the Red Sea during the greater part of three summers, and I never found the heat so great, nor the humidity so oppressive, as I have found them in Bushahr. The mean temperature of the year in this place, in the open air, is about 90° Fahrenheit, that of the coldest months, January and February, being 73° Fahrenheit, and the hottest (August) being 106° in the shade. That of the lowest temperature at any time in the year being 40, which occurs always in February, and of the highest temperature at any time during the year in the summer being 150°, which always occurs some time in August. The annual range is about 110° Fahren heit. During the months of December, January, and February, beauti ful white clouds are frequently seen resting against the face and often shrouding the summits of the hills or mountains situated to the east of the plain, which very often envelope the plain in impenetrable obscu rity; nor do they fail even in making visits to the sea, particularly when the wind shifts from west to east and favours a move in that direction. These clouds are occasioned by the condensation of the ex halations from the Gulf meeting, or coming in contact with, the cool mountain air. During the prevalence of the phenomenon, the inhabi tants of the villages under the brows of the mountains, as well as these of Bushahr, are very subject to attacks of ague and rheumatism. During the same months, particularly December, lightning, thunder, and strong gales of winds are prevalent, accompanied occasionally by hail show ers, and snow is seen during the same period on the second range of mountains bearing from east to north of the town. March is a pleasant month, neither too cold nor too hot. April and May are uncomfortable and unhealthy, owing to the brightness of the atmo sphere ; and high and stormy gusts of wind which carry the impalpable particles of sand with which the country is covered.BUS—BUS For a full report upon the trade of Bushahr—vaWd “ Report on the Administration of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, 1882-83, ” pages 34—61, and the reports of succeeding years. Bell (1884) writes,—“At Bushahr the anchorage for large shipping (inner roads) is 2^ miles for the town, in 3 to 4 fathoms in low water over a muddy bottom, its advantages of pier accommodation over the smaller bunders are not great, the advantages arising from the house accommodation afforded by the town and the working population are however considerable. Deeper water in shore than that opposite the town is found 4 or 5 miles to the east of it at Rashir, and there also are the wells of sweet water, and the telegraph offices and European residences. It is high tide, full and change at Abu Shahr at about 7| hours: the spring rise and fall varies from 6' to 8', and the neaps rise from 4 to 6': their range being 2' to l 7 . In summer the day tides, and in winter the night tides, are much the greater.Return of Foreign Shipping at the Tort of Bushahr during the year 1882.164 BUS-CHA BUSHKAN—Lat. Long.

A mountain range in Ears, due north of Dihrud. {St. John.) c CHAB ARABS (originally K'AB)— „ . . . A tribe of Arabs who inhabit the southern portion ot the plain ot Khuzistan, whose boundaries are thus minutely described by Layard “An imaginary line drawn from above Wais, a village^ on the Karun, to Khalfabad, a village on the Jarahi, and continued by the Zaitun hills to the Zurah, or river of Hindiyan, on the north east, the river of Hindiyan on the east, the sea on the south, and the Karfin on the west. The tribes under the Shaikh inhabit the right bank of that river, but do not extend far into the interior. They also occupy its banks from Ahwaz to its junction with the Shatt-ul-Arab, and both banks of the Bahr-el-Mashlr to the Persian Gulf. The most important rivers in Persia thus traverse the country in the possession of this Shaikh. The district occupied by the Chab Arabs is at the same time of great extent, and it is necessary, in accounting for the smallness of the population, to remember that the interval between these rivers is, in general, a complete desert, without any supply of water, except during the rainy season, and in the months immediately succeeding. The Chab Arabs originally came from Wasit and the marshes at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. They were buffalo herdsmen, and, settling on the Delta formed by the estuary of the Shatt-ul-Arab and the Karun, they founded the town of Koffan. The country they now inhabit was at that time occupied by the Persian tribe of Afghans, and the town of Dorak was their principal settlement. The Chab Arabs, in the course of time, by treachery, and with the aid of the Wall of Hawizah, succeeded indrivingthe Afshars out, and taking possession of their country, which they have since retained.Residence. Hindiyan, Dih Mula, right bank of the river of Hindi yan and Zaitun hills. Banks of the Jarahi, near Fellah iy ah. Pelly’s list differs from the above sufficiently to induce me to give it also:— Al-bu-Ghubaish, 6,000 adults reside near Buziah, their principal town. Asurkirah, 4,000 5J 99 at Oushar near Buziah. Mukasebah, 2,500 99 at Anayetu more south and east. Albu AH, 2,500 9) 99 on a creek with no name. Suwaihat, 2,500 99 99 ditto ditto. Almukadaxn, 4,500 99 99 at Kut, near Dorak-al-Khuferah. Alkhunaferah, 5,000 99 99 on road to Dorak from Muhammarah. Banwi, Zurgan, 8,000 99 99 on the Jarahi creek and mouth. 8,000 99 99 on pasture grounds. Sharifat, 10,000 99 99 at Hindian and Dih Mula and on the plains. Amur, 10,000 99 99 wandering and pastoral. Banikhalid, 5,000 99 99 ditto ditto. Pelly considers these numbers exaggerated. These tribes are scattered about through the pasture lands during winter and spring, and concentrate at or near Fellahiyah towards summer for provisions and trade. Of the 72 tribes which composed the Chab nation, some have emi grated to Turkish territory; others have died out, and of others mere fragments remain. The Chab tribes, which are still influential, are the Muhaisen of Muhammarah and the Edndjirah Amkirah, Mujdddlm, Al-bu-Ghubaish of Fellahiyah, numbering in all some 9,300 adult males. [Robertson.) The authority of the Chab Shaikh does undoubtedly extend over all these tribes, when, in absence of aggression from other quarters, he has it in his power by superior numerical strength to enforce it, but the Bawls and Sharlfats are large, powerful tribes, and consider themselves more under the protection than under the absolute authority, of the Shaikh. The Shaikh, supposing the Bawls and Sharifats to be on good terms with him, might collect, perhaps, 7,000 men of his own, of which 3,000 are well armed with muskets and matchlocks, 1,000 would be horsemen, and 3,000 indifferently armed with spears and swords. The Bawls might bring about 1,000 horsemen, and perhaps 2,000 footmen without good weapons, and the Skarlfats about 2,000 foot and 700 horse, or about 2,700 men. The Shaikh has, besides, three small guns and a few dismounted ones at Fellahiyah. The Chab Arabs owe most of their importance and prosperity to the celebrated Chief, Shaikh Thamlr, who encouraged agriculture and commerce, and those engaged in such pursuits. Canals and watercourses upon which the cultivation of this country can alone depend were kept in good re pair, and new works of the kind frequently undertaken. Caravans and travellers through his country were well protected, and cases of plun- 166The annual sum paid by the Shaikh to the Governor of Fars is only £1,700, but some pretence is generally found to exact a larger sum. Beyond the payment of this very small tribute, these Arabs can scarce ly be considered Persian subjects, and no local Governor, or even Agent, resides at Fellahiyah, the head quarters of the Shaikh. The greater portion of the Chab Arabs have become Dih Nishins, settlers in vil lages on the Karun; they possess Wais, Ahwaz, Ismailiyah, Idrisiyah, Muhammarah ; on the Jarahx, Fellahiyah, Jungeri, Bonei-Boneydzan, Busi, Kareibah Kazi, Dob-el-Mir, Sederah, Attegeyzah, Hadamah, Boweiwar, Rihanah, Bonehbeyan, Khalfabad, and Cham Sabi; on the river of Hindiyan; Dih Mula, Gurgeri on the sea, Bandar Mashur, and one or two other settlements. To these may be added other small villages scattered through the country. Many of them, and indeed almost all those that are on the Jarahi, are composed of huts built of reeds. Villages are daily rising, whilst others are as frequently falling into decay owing to consumption of pasture, destruction of water courses, and other causes which must influence the state of an erratic population depending much on nature and little upon itself, even for the common necessaries of life. The Chabs have lost much of the genuine Arab character. Their Shaikh exercises a despotic power over his dependants, and the usual relation between an Arab Chief and his tribe no longer exists. The blood of the Chab has also become mixed, though not perhaps directly with that of the Persian. They have frequently intermarried with natives of Shushtar, Dizful, and Bihbahan. The inhabitants of Khuzistan, it is true, claim an Arab descent, but there is scarcely a family which has not a, very marked mixture of Persian blood. Many refugees from the principal towns in the province have also settled in the territories of these Arabs, and many of the Chiefs of the mountain tribes have also frequently inter married with them. The Chabs have become Shias. The other Arabs will not inter marry with them, but it is said that the Chabs do not scruple to marry Persians, a great disgrace in the eyes of an Arab. The Chabs strike one as being exceptionally intelligent, which they owe probably to contact with the subtle and witty Persians. Their manners and ceremonies are rather altogether Persian than Arab, and their dress, with the exception of the head-dress, is often Persian. Persian women, being excellent cooks, are highly esteemed by them as wives. The mutual dislike and contempt between the Persians and Arabs is very strong and quite undisguised in the lower classes. The Chabs once built a dam at Maud, on the Karun, some 8 miles above where Muhammarah now stands, it turned the Karun bodily towards Kaban, their ancient capital. When the Chabs underwent the usual process of internal dissension at the end of the last century, the dam fell into ruin, and, the Karun taking its present course, Kaban became the parched desert it now is, and had to be abandoned. The Chabs then moved their seat of government to Dorak, or Fella hiyah, on the Jarahi, but their decline in enterprise, as in numbers and power, has been steady since then. 167CHA-CHA The most fertile spots in the territory of the Chab Shaikh are those in the environs of D5rak, and on the banks of the Hafar and Shatt-ul- Arab. H ere alone dates and rice are produced, and from these districts the Shaikh derives the principal part of his revenues. TV heat and barley are only grown in scanty portions, scarcely sufficient for the supply of the inhabitants in the immediate vicinity of the towns and villages. The rice harvest is in August and September, and that of other grain in April and May. The first is cultivated in those parts which are well watered by artificial canals drawn from the different rivers ; but the latter is chiefly dependent on the periodical tains for its nourish ment. The north and west parts of the country afford tolerable pastu rage ; and here the wandering tribes, which compose no small portion of the population, pitch their tents. Both banks of the Karun, from its junction with the Ab-i-tal below Shustar, are uninhabited, and con sequently uncultivated and covered with brushwood, the resort of lions, wild boars, and other animals. Morasses are also common in this country towards Goban and the sea, and between Dorak and the Karun. The Chab country is watered by three rivers, the Karun, Tab, and Jarahi. The Chabs possess large flocks of camels. The commerce of the Chabs is limited, and flows in different channels, according to the season of the year. Some of it reaches Muhammarah, and is mixed up with the trade of that port. The principal seaports of the Chabs are Bandar Mashhur and Hindiyan. The trade of Chab, says Belly, will always be confined to Chab itself and to the provinces of Shustar and Bihbahan. The passes leading into the plateau of Persia from these points may possess strategic advantages, but they are not lines that trade could work to a profit in competition with Bushahr, Abbass, or Baghdad; rice, corn, ghee, and the products generally of semi-pastoral and semi-agricultural tribes enjoying a rich soil and fine water command might be expected from the territory contained between the Karun river, the Bakhtiari, and Kuhgehlu moun tains, the Hindiyan, and Bahr-el-mashir. Dates, of course, may form an item and be grown, as also might cotton, over a large area. The Chab territory is by no means an easy one to traverse. In the rainy season the direct road from the Hafar to Dorak is quite impassable, and even the circuitous road by the Karun is almost equally so. And, after the subsidence of the rains, this tract would be fatal to horses and men from the marsh insects and miasma. Grass is plentiful in the spring of favourable years, but in dry seasons nothing is to be got, for the chopped straw of the last year is exhausted, and the grass is too short, while corn is only found round the villages. The water, too, is brackish along the whole line, unless when drawn from the river; that from the Hafar and Hindiyan is delicious, but the water from the Dorak canal is rough, distasteful, and unwholesomq, especially in the summer months. The Chab territory is really tributary to Persia, and pays a con siderable sum into the Shustar provincial treasury. Its element of greatest commercial strength and military weakness lies in the bounti ful supply of water. It would be difficult to find a country of equal extent, where fresh water containing sufficient silt is poured along the 1GB169 CHA-CHA plain in all directions, through channels so numerous and so easily manageable. But it was by damming the exits of this water towards the sea that the Persians flooded the country and reduced the Chabs. In the Hawizah district; many of the tribes are Muntafik, who have crossed the Tigris to escape the exactions of the Muntafik Shaikhs. When the Mula of Hawizah is strong they pay him tribute, and when he is weak they decline to do so. They protect a number of Fellah tribes. The Mifntafiks are Sunnis, and the Shaikh has 30,000 fighting Arabs at his command. Hajji Jabir Khan, Nusrut-ul-Mulk, Governor of Muhammarah, died in October 1881, and was succeeded by his younger and abler son Shaikh Mizal. His elder brother Muhammad resides, by order, at Isfahan. On the death of Shaikh Jabir the Persian Government divided the Chab territory. It now will seek occasion, or find a pretext, to establish a more detailed supervision over the tribe. In 1883 the Persians endeavoured to establish a custom-house under Persian management at Muhammarah. Fortunately the endeavour failed. It is said that no sooner is a Persian custom-house established in an Arab port than its commerce at once falls off on account of ex actions. Such was said not to be the case if the Arabs manage theii own customs. Muhammarah possesses considerable advantages as a trading mart, and places in Persian hands a strategical position of the highest value in the event of war with Turkey. If held by a foreign power, that power will enjoy considerable political and commercial advantages. The town and its dependent districts are now governed by Shaikh Mizal, who appears to have fairly well established his authority. He pays an annual revenue of 45,000 tumans. [Administration Report, 1883-84.) Shaikh Kahmah is now Governor of Fellahiyah, and Mir Abdulla of Dih Mula. The former pays a revenue of 15,000 tumans and the latter of 12,000 tumans. Previously to May 1878, the Fellahiyah section of the Ka’b Arabs was governed by Shaikh Sufti-bin-Imbadir, their hereditary Chief. On his murder by his cousin he was succeeded by Shaikh Rahmah. At the same time the districts of Dih-ul-Mula, Jarrahi, Hindiyan, and Bandar Mashur were detached from the Fellahiyah jurisdiction and placed under Amir Abdulla of Dih Mula. [Bell.) CHAFTA—Lat, Long.

Some firewood could be got from the interior, by waiting a few T days. The population is chiefly Persian and agri cultural. This place lies near the south-east end of the Dirang range; the coast between it and Kangun is low and sandy, being opposite the opening of a great valley. There is capital anchorage here in a “ Shimal, ” in 8 or 10 fathoms, from \ to 1 mile off shore, with muddy bottom. {Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) DALAHC—Lat. Long. _ Elev. A mountain near to Zohab in Kurdistan. {Rawlinson.) DALAKI—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Ears, 36 miles north-north-east of Bushahr, containing 150 houses. Euel and forage are procurable, as also are supplies and 179 12 a.1 • 180 DAL-DAL cattle in small quantities. It is celebrated for its naphtha springs. On approaching DalakI from Bushahr, sulphur springs are first met with ; they well copiously from the base of the hills and flow m streams across the road. A little further on, the brown naphtha may be seen floating on the white sulphurous waves. The whole plain on the left of theroad is converted into a marsh by these streams. The pungent odour from this swamp is abominable and spreads over the surrounding country for a great distance. Some mills are erected near the bank of one of the streams. The marsh is covered by a dense jungle of reeds which swarm with wild boar. The vilbige is a wretched one, consisting only of a few mud huts, surrounded by the extensive date plantations, for which it is famous, which, contrasting with the hills, of various and strange hues, in the background, give it quite a pic- turesque appearance. It stands at the foot of a range of salt^hills, which, rugged and sterile, rise to a considerable height behind it. These salt hills are remarkable in shape and colour, as is always the case with salt hills in Persia. They are angular and abrupt, curiously stratified, and coloured red or brown, green, light blue, grey and white. They are said to abound with wild goat and ibex. A small fort that once existed here is now in ruins, having been destroyed some time ago by the people of Burazjun. There is a clean mosque of white stucco and a small bath at the extremity of the village. The Rohilla river is one mile distant. The village pays a revenue of 3,000 tumans. DalakI is considered one of the hottest places in the country. The DalakI river rises in a ravine above Masarm, Fars, and runs past Jarah, where it turns west to Dalakl. It is crossed, just above DalakI, by a good stone-bridge, with a solitary square tower at the bridge head. There are the ruins of two older bridges a little way down stream. {Ouseley — Malcolm — Clark — Monteith — Morier — Taylor — Telly — -Tone? — Stack — Ussher — Durand.) Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between DalakI and Bushahr as regards its sanitary conditions:— “ The district is nowhere many feet above the sea, and for 4 far- sakhs, reaching to Chahgadak, high-spidng tides sometimes overflow the plain. Dates, cereals, melons, &amp;c., are extensively cultivated ; the country around Burazjun is very fertile. From Bushahr to Chahgadak no water is procurable, beyond this it can be found every one or two farsakhs, though generally slightly brackish ; one farsakh before reaching DalakI are numerous naphtha springs, which impreg nate the water. The drinking supply at Burazjun is from wells, and is fairly good to the taste, but here, as well as along the road, it is apt to cause diarrhoea or colic to travellers. Excellent water can be procured from the hills a few miles to the east of Burazjun, and also from a spring one mile east of Dalakl. The climate is very hot, damp, and sultry during the greater part of the year; at times hot winds are prevalent. From April to September inclusive no travelling can be done during the heat of the day, and during June, July, and August, only at night. Near Bushahr and, to a less extent, as far as Burazjun,DAL—-DAL ings.

Burazj““&gt; from about 20th May to the end of June during the “ Shimal/ , sea breezes are felt towards evening, and these make the climate somewhat more endurable. “ Dalalu is one of the hottest places in Persia, and when the wind is from the direction of the naphtha and sulphur wells, the air is most obnoxious. In the spring, midges and sand-flies abound, the former on the march, and the latter, together with mosquitoes, during a halt make the travellers life a burden. Dates and bread form the staple diet, supplemented by rice, ghi, and eggs. In the spring and summer, mast, dong melons, and cucumbers are plentiful, and quantities are eaten. There is not a large consumption of meat; the better classes occasionally eat mutton or fowl, and the poorer goat's flesh. Diseases most common in this district are intermittent fever, which in autumn is sometimes so severe that it causes many deaths, enlarged spleen, hepatitis, dyspepsia, infantile diarrhoea, and diseases of the eye, espe cially ophthalmia. Other diseases also met with are haemorrhoids, cos tiveness, dropsy, paralysis, especially hemiplegia, intestinal worms, (Ascaris lumbricoides are the most common, but Oxyuris vermicu laris and Toenia solium also occur), asthma, bronchitis of old people, eczemas, syphilis, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, small-pox, and probably typhoid fever. Cases of heat apoplexy occur during the summer, especially to travellers. “ Eye-diseases, usually commencing with ophthalmia, are the bane of this district.; probably one person in every four has lost the use of one eye. Total blindness is by no means rare, and few have good vision in both eyes. Often, when a child is attacked, no treatment is sought, no trouble is taken to keep the eyes clean, flies are allowed to settle on the eyes, perhaps an ulcer is left on the corner, this process is repeated until perhaps the iris is also affected or the whole body of the eye. It is no uncommon thing to see a person with extensive opaci ties of cornea and with pupil closed or nearly so. Sometimes the eye is collapsed, and a history is told of acute inflammation, evidently purulent ophthalmia, where sloughing of cornea and consequent blind ness has occurred within 24 hours. On the whole, I do not think this district is especially unhealthy, though the summer is very depressing and enervating, especially to Europeans. DALAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A mountain situated north-east of Diz Malikan in Luristan. It is described as lofty and precipitous. Ii is probably on the range of Bakhtiaris. [Layard.) DALICH (DlH-I-LIZ)—Lat. Long. Elev. A range of hills in Luristan, passed on the road between Dizful and Khuramabad about Badamak, 109 miles from Dizful, crossed by the Dalicli Pass (6,020 feet). In April 1884 these hills were snow-topped; the range lies about 105° or W.N.-W. to E.S.-E. The ascent is not steep, but difficult, on account of the high ledges of rocks and boulders to be surmount ed. It could readily be simplified. The range is in close proximity to the Kheolah range more to the east. (Bell.) 181182 DAL—DAR DALIN (?)—Lat. Long-. _ &lt; Elev.

A fort and village in Ears, about 163 miles from Bandar Abbas, on the road to Saiadabad, by Ahmadi. It is a poor hamlet, with water and supplies for a small party. [Gill.) DARABGIRD or DARAB—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Ears, about 150 miles south-east of Shiraz, and *87 miles north-west of Bandar Abbas. It has a fine situation on the banks of a river, and on an extensive plain, interspersed with villages and cultivated lands, and is surrounded with groves of lemon and orange trees, which yield such an abundance of fruit that the mice is exported to every port of Persia. The cultivation of tobacco is also carried to a great extent, and such is its excellent quality that it is ex ported to Shiraz, and even to India and Arabia. This place has fallenfrom its former splendour; yet, although a great part of it is in ruins, it still contains between 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. The mountains on the north of it form an amphitheatre, the deepest part of which is about 1 mile from the town, which extends towards the two horns of the crescent. To the south rises at a short distance a long line of rocks, which at one part are sculptured on their southern face, and between them and the houses of the place is a small mud fort of no pretensions. The place possesses no elevated ground, and is in this respect wanting in picturesqueness; but, viewed from a house-top, the scene is very pleasing, so great is the extent of the foliage. The palm or date trees scattered over so wide a space are numerous, but generally planted wide apart. The people appear to have neglected the cultivation of these valuable trees for some time past at Darab. It is affirmed that fifty years since the number of date trees was 100,000, of which only 30,000 remain. They are taxed according to their bearing. Offsets from them, when transplanted, become in the course of some years a source of wealth to their owners. Darab possesses no bazars, but only a few shops, of which six are of linen-drapers, dealing in English manufactures. ^ The climate of the district is oppressively warm in the plain during the summer months. In winter snow is rarely seen there. The climate of the hills, of course, varies with the elevations. The productions of the district are wheat, barley, zohret, suferd (a species of millet), rice, tobacco, sesame seed, and cotton, and the revenue is £6,300, raised amongst a fixed population of 2,500 families belonging to this district. The soil is reputed of great ferti lity in many parts. W hen rain falls in sufficient quantity, grain yields from ten to fifty-fold. The hills on the south side of the plain, having no water, are uninhabited. Iron mines are said to exist at ‘ Shekkaroo/ The district possesses plenty of flocks and herds. Of the former, which are usually black and brown, or reddish, as in other parts of Ears, goats are more numerous than sheep. The extent of the district is 50 miles west to east and 27 north to south. Darabgird was built by Darius the First. (Kinneir—Malcolm—Jones—Abbott.) DARAB KHANI— A clan of the Kashkai tribe of Iliyats in Pars, who occupy the tract lyino- between Ghll-i-Kharzi, near Bandar Abbas, to Gaudimun and Nokhum dun.

A large lake in the province of Ears, about 10 miles east of Shiraz. The length of it is about 60 miles, with a breadth of, perhaps, 3 to 5 miles. The water of this lake is almost entirely derived from the river Kur, better known as the Band Amir. In dry summer season the water evaporates entirely and its bed may then be tra versed on foot, and the inhabitants take the opportunity of collecting the salt with which its bed is encrusted, and which is esteemed remarkably fine, and is in general use throughout Ears. Its banks are often completely whitened by the presence of innumerable water birds, chiefly swans and flamingos, which latter also may be seen wading far into the water in search of their prey. The oyster- catcher is seen abundantly, but is very timid. The water is extremely salt. The shores have no sandy beach, but soft fine mud, which has an unpleasant saline smell when stirred up, and no shells are to be seen in it. The inhabitants say that it contains no fish or any living animal, but it is not improbable that in the mud are found polypi and other living creatures, upon which the birds feed. {Abbott.) Wells (30th April 1881) describes the lake from his halting-place, Khana-i-Kitf, as follow :— “ We walked down to the lake for a bathe, but found it impossible to get into water above our knees, though we trudged away for at least a quarter of a mile. Large flocks of flamingos were flying to and fro, and a large sort of black and white duck. The shore of the lake had an unpleasant, soapy, saline smell when the mud was stirred. In marching along the banks many fine streams of clear water are passed, but they are all brackish to within | a mile of Khlr, when sud denly one comes on a sweet spring. At 15 miles from Khlr the lake dies away into a sodaish white ooze, and a good stream of fresh water flows in here.'”186 DAR—DAS DARIA-I-PARTSF1AN or FAMUR LAKE— Lat. Long 1 . Elev. A lake in the Kazrun valley, Ears, situated about 8 miles south-west of Kazrun. It is not clear whether it is salt or not, but it receives the drainage of the Kazrun valley. Whether it has any outlet to the east is not known. It is a long narrow sheet of water, stretching north east and south-west. The village of Famur is situated at its south east extremity, and there is excellent grazing on its banks. {MacGregor.) DARIAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A canal in Khuzistan in the neighbourhood of Shustar, said to have been cut by Ardashir Baba Khan, to lead the water from the Karun into the town ,and into the fields beyond, but this is improbable, as Ardashir would have had his hands too full to find sufficient time for the work. But the canal, as its name indicates, may have been one of the works of Darius, the name Dalian being a contraction of Darabian. {Schindler.) DARIAN—Lat. Long. Elev.

Shiraz about 141187 miles from the former. It lias thirty wretched huts, and a solitary tower, with a not over-abundant supply of brackish water. The name of the place means “ stone ” in Turkish, from the fact of their being lead mines there. There are so-called works there. The lead seams run parallel to the general strike of the hills. It is found both in the form of an oxide, and associated with copper. It is reduced to a metallic state by pulverisation, washing, and heating in a blast fur nace, all of which operations are performed in the most primitive manner. The refuse copper ore is thrown away, as the miners are not acquainted with the manner of reducing it to a metallic state. There are about 40 miners here. The yearly outturn is about 4,500 maunds, of which one-sixth is levied as a tax by the Fars Govern ment. {Lovett.) DASHT-AB—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Fars, 132 miles from Bandar Abbas, on the camel-road to Yazd. Supplies obtainable here. {MacGregor.) DASHTABBAS—Lat. Long. Elev.

There is a pass near this 3,500 feet above the sea. {Durand.) DASHTI—Lat. Long. Elev. A division of Fars, situated to the south-west of Shiraz. It in cludes the villages of Khormuj. Pusekun, Dekekun, Kuzerak, Bush- kan, Senim Shombeh, Thalek, Kalimah, Kankey, Sarmastan and Bardistan (its seaport). It produces wheat, dates, barley, and cotton. There are 4,000 or 5,000 matchlockmen in Dashti. The chiefs are endeavouring to improve Bardistan. During the last 40 years the Dashtis have on three or four occasions attacked Kangun, plundered and killed a number of people, and induced the others to settle at Bardistan. Khormuj is the chief town of this district, which must not be confounded with Dashtistan of which Burazjun is the chief place. Muhammad Khan, chief of Dashti, died in June 1882 at Bushahr, where he was in. close imprisonment for arrears of revenue. A nephew, Jamal Khan, succeeds him in charge of Dashti. {Felly — St. John — Foss.) DASHT-I-ABZAN or ARJAN— Lat. Long. Elev. 6,600'. A plain in Fars, 45 miles west of Shiraz, across which lies the main road from Bushahr. It is about 16 miles long by about 10 miles broad. In summer it is said to be very verdant and afford good pasturage, but in winter it is very bleak, and the cold is intense. The188 DAS—DAS centre of the plain is very swampy, and there is always abundance of water and forage. It is said formerly to have been the bed of a lake. There is a village of sixty families here called Dashti Arzan, with a telegraph office, also a grey mud fort called Kala Mashir {Pioneer's Correspondent). The plain of Dasht-i-Arzan has evidently within a recent period been the bed of a lake; indeed, half of it is still a marsh. It is bounded on the south by limestone rocks in irregular masses, divided by valleys, filled with dwarf oak and hawthorn, on the east and west are lime-stone cliffs, about 200 feet high, and on the north sand stone and gypsum. The soil is a black alluvial deposit. The valley is remarkable for its ample supply of water, for its verdure, and for its being a favourite haunt of the nomads during the warm season. In spring there is a good deal of grass on this plain, and fuel is always procurable. The climate, however, is said not to be good, fever being prevalent, and a serious cause of irritation existing in the very numer ous and venomous serpents which abound in it. The name means “ The plain of wild olives.'” The Arjan tree, or rather shrub, is com mon in the south of Persia at this elevation, and fringes the margin of the swamp. This swamp in the winter becomes from the rain a lake of no mean dimensions. {Monteith — Ouseley — St. John — Petty — Jones —“ Pioneer’s Correspondent ” 1881— Stack.) Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes regarding the district between Kaziun and Dasht-i-Arjan— “ There is a fair supply of drinking water on the road, which, after climbing the Kotal-i-Dukhtar, leads through the Oak valley. Here, in early summer, is a large fly; mosquitoes also are numerous. The former attacks horses, producing large brawny swellings, and quickly causing a loss of condition; the latter effectually prevents the traveller from sleeping. “ The road now leads up the Kotal-i-Pirzan (7,400 feet). Half-way up, at a caravansarai, is an abundant supply of excellent water. Descend ing (water generally abundant) the plain of Dasht-i-Arjan is reached (4,100 feet above sea-level). Nearly one-half of this plain is covered by a marshy lake, which apparently has no outlet. The climate here varies greatly. The Oak valley has a mild winter, but is very hot in summer j on the top of the Ixotal-i-Plrzan the winter is very severe, and the same may be said of Dasht-i-Arjan. Here in summer the sun is hot, but the nights are generally cool. About the Oak valley and the Kotal-i-Pirzan the population is very small. The diet is principally acorn bread. Intermittent fever, dyspepsia, and ophthal mia are prevalent. At Dasht-i-Arjan intermittent fever is always pie valent; it causes many deaths to children : the greater part of the population have enlarged spleens and often enlarged livers; the patient at the same time often either suffers from costiveness or severe diarrhoea. During 1883-84 small-pox was very prevalent; in the spring of the latter year scarcely a family escaped. Stone in the bladder also occurs. Perhaps one or two cases are brought into Shiraz every year for operation/'’Me of a lake, with oneer) thin a marsh, oasses, istand i sand, valley for its .

At the commencement of the plain is one of those covered water-tanks {db-ambdr) so common in Persia, with delicious cool water, though not very clear. This plain is beautifully wooded on its area and sides with oaks, some of consider able size, but the majority are stunted specimens. It must be of considerable elevation, as Rich found the night air very cold there even in July. [Rich — MacGregor — Stack.) DASHT-I-KALA—Lat. Long. Elev.

Elev. A bare uncultivated plain in Ears, east of Shiraz, on the northern shore of Lake Nlris. It has a number of ruined fortified villages dotted about it. The kanats, or irrigation channels, that formerly supplied these habitations with water have fallen in or failed, and the whole of the people have abandoned the district. (Wells.) DASHT-I-MUAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A small valley in Ears, about 2 miles long by f mile broad covered with almond, wild olive and mastich (pana) about half-way between Shiraz and Elruzabad. A solitary fort stands in the middle, re cently built for a garrison of ten “ tufangchis,” who cultivate a little wheat and receive precarious pay. It is watered by a sprino*, which breaks out of a cleft in the rocks a little to the left of the road to Elruzabad, which passes through it. This stream makes its escape at the farthest end of the dell, and beyond the valley it falls into a ravine, under a huge precipitous hill. (Stack.) DASHT-I-SIAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A plain in Ears, on the Flruzabad road to Shiraz from Bushahr and between the former and Earrashband. It is without villages, but the nomads resort to it in winter on account of its mild and agreeable climate, and the springs of good water which exist. Supplies of all kinds may be readily obtained from the nomads. (Jones.) DASHTISTAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A large plain in Ears, which stretches between the hills and the sea north and east of Bushahr, from theKhisht river as far as Kangun from north-west to south-east, a distance of perhaps 70 miles, with a breadth of from 10 to 25 miles. It is inhabited principally by Arabs, nominally subject to the government of Ears. 189190 DAU—DiiL Its fertility beyond the immediate vicinity of Bushahr is considerablej producing 1 abundant crops of wheat and barley. It has some very large villages within its limits^ viz., Tangistan, Samal, Burazjun and Dalakl. The inhabitants are said to be very vicious, but very warlike. [Felly — Winchester.') This is a noted locality for the purchase of Arab horses. [I.B., W.O., 1881, Part I.) DAULATAbAD—L at. Long. Elev. A place in Ears, a few miles from Bihbahan on the road from Hindian to Shiraz.

A village in Persian Kurdistan, containing a hundred houses, about 11 miles from Sihna on the road thence to Sullmania. The inhabitants of this village are mostly engaged in trade, not agriculture. The men are carriers, and are employed in charge of the caravan which passes between Sullmania, Sihna and Hamadan. The village belongs to the uncle of the Wazlr of Kurdistan, and pays only a light assessment of 100 tumans per annum; the revenue, according to the standard imposed on other villages, would be about three times that sum. The people are Sunis, and, like the Kurds in general, entertain a special reverence for Abd-ul-Kadir GllanI, whose masjid and tomb are at Baghdad. They call him their Imam, their Khallfah. The price of wheat at Dawaiza was % tumans per 100 tabrlzl mans, and of barley 1| tumaus. (Z'. C. Plowden.) DAWIRAN—Lat. Long. Elev.

Supplies and fuel are procurable. It is considered a very cold place. There is great differ ence of opinion about the water-supply here. Jones says it is procur able ; Clerk says there is a moderate supply of water from a small stream, but Sutherland says the only water is contained in a dirty pond about 15 feet in diameter. [Jones — Morier — Clerk — Sutherland.) The country near Dih-i-Bid is undulating, with plenty of good spring water. Encamped near post-house, in the bank of a clear stream. ( Trotter.) MacGregor says this place is situated on a wild, desolate plateau, surrounded by hills, rising from 1,000 to 3,000 feet higher. The climate is excellent, and there is an abundance of water, though but few villages. Near it is a telegraph station, and the ruins of an ancient Gabr mound. This statement is materially different to the previous authorities, but, as it is of later date, the probabilities are that it is the most reliable. [MacGregor.) Mr. Odling writes— “ Small-pox is very prevalent in Dih-i-Bid and often fatal. Were it not for infectious diseases I should look upon this district as remark ably healthy. Dih-i-Bid is fitted in every way to be a sanitarium for those requiring a bracing atmosphere after long residence in hot climates or for convalescents after illness.”209 14 D1H-I-BUZURG—Lat. Long.

The ruined sarai occupied consisted of a series of apartments with pointed arched and domed roofs, opening into a quadrangular yard; their side walls were recessed, each recess being covered by a pointed arch; the arching, their side jambs, &amp;c., were of cut stone. Bearing north-east are seen two ranges, one in rear of the other : the distant range, the Kuh-i-Nil, is covered with snow, and has a probable elevation of 12,000 feet: the nearer one is known as the Kuh-i-Slah. The field labour available seems to be quite insufficient to cultivate the extensive undulating plain, about the centre of which the village stands. It was noticed that the ears of corn were in many cases plucked and the stalks left standing: yet chopped straw is much wanted in many parts of the country/' f5,221' (Wells). DIH-I-DIZ-Lat. Long.

They number about 1,500 families * and reside during the summer near Khawah and Harasim, and in winter at Hulilan, Kuhd, Dasht, Rudbar, Chardawar and Tirhan. 4his tribe possess a very fine breed of mules ; they are large, strong, capable of carrying great weight and enduring much fatigue, and are much esteemed throughout Persia. Their subdivisions are- (1) Muminawand- Badawar. (2) Kakawand 5 branches, 2,000 families, inhabiting Darm Rud, south of Karmanshah.

DINAH or DINA or KUH.I-DINA— Lat. Long. Elev. A mountain range in Ears, about north-north-east from Shiraz. It has several peaks, and consequently varying elevations. That of one ascended by Durand in 1878 is about 14,900 feet. Mists and rain upon the summit prevented the position of places below being fixed. As cent was made with much difficulty, owing to the steep slopes of shingle which have to be surmounted. A camp should be made on the top, in order to explore properly. A great number of sweet and strong-smelling herbs are found on this mountain, the ascent of which is asserted, by the natives, to cause sleep; hence many Rip Van Winkle stories of persons who have been thus overpowered. Cakes of dried buttermilk are eaten by the natives to counteract the effect of these plants. Snakes are found on the summit. Many ruined villages in the valley below. (Duratid.) Bell gives maximum height at 13,000 feet. This range extends alono- the Isfahan-Bihbahan road (via Ardal) from Felat to Khurra, a dis^ tance of about 83 miles. (Bell.) DlNARHNIS— A tribe of Khuzistan, who inhabit the valley of Susan and Burs and the mountains in the immediate neighbourhood and the rich plain of Mai-Amir. Placed between the Haft Lang and Chahar Lang Bakhtiaris, they usually side with the strongest. The largest sub division is the 'All Muhammadi. They are most notorious thieves, and are as barbarous and ignorant as any tribes in the mountains, and it is only through fear of their more powerful neighbours the Bakh- tiaris that they are kept in subjection. They muster a few good horsemen and are admirable matchlockmen. They cultivate corn barley, and rice, and possess large flocks of sheep and goats. They are believed to have originally come from Isfahan, and can muster about o,\jyj\j men. \nayiiru.) DlNARIWAND— A small subdivision of the Pusht-i-Kuh branch of the Faili Lurs in Khuzistan. They number about 200 families, and inhabit during the summer the mountains to the north-west of Kabir Kuh and the country near Khuramabad, and m the winter come down to the foot of the above mountains. (Bayard.) DINAWAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A plain, defile, and stream on the caravan route from Tabriz to Kar- manshah, Persian Kurdistan. The plain is entered from the north by the Gardan-i-Mitawas Pass, the easiest between Suugar and Karman- shah. Napier says, though rugged, this pass is by no means a 213214 DIR—DIZ serious obstacle : guns might cross it in its present state, and a little labour would render it easily practicable. At the foot of the pass lies the little valley of Dinawar, and opposite to it frowns a precipitous, im practicable-looking range of mountains, which however is pierced by the drainage of many hundred square miles of country. From the plain of Dinawar flow two considerable streams which find an exit through the u Tang,” or defile of Dinawar. The road winds for 7 miles between towering precipices, and would be difficult to traverse in the face of any determined opposition, its flanks for many miles being inacces sible, and, when accessible, so flanked by steep scarps as to be nearly im practicable to direct assault. A detour of about 20 to 30 miles from Dinawar east over a low pass, crossed with ease by horsemen and laden camels to Sihna, a station on the high road, turns the defile. {Napier, 1876.) DIRA—Lat. 30° 4' 22'. Long. 49° 5' 50'. Elev. An island off the coast of Khuzistan, Persia. It is low and has a swamp in the centre. (Bruchs.) DIZ or AB-I-DIZ or AB-I-DIZFUL—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, which rises in the mountains to the north-west of Burujird. Its principal, and indeed almost its only tributary, Kamand Ah, unites with it immediately before its entrance into the mountains at the village of Bahrain in the plain of Buruj’rd, from thence it flows almost due south to Dizful, receiving a few small mountain torrents on its way, but no stream of any importance. About 5 miles above Dizful, it is joined by the Bala Rud, and also by the Sabzab, when it turns sharply south-east and runs generally in that direction till it joins the Karun at Band-i-Kir. Its course is exces sively tortuous and serpentine; frequently in its windings it recoils upon itself within a few yards and then suddenly diverges for some miles. In one instance a bank, little more than 9 feet in breadth, separates the two reaches of the river, which after a circuitous course of about 10 miles returns to the same spot. The banks of this river are thickly wooded with poplar and tamarisk, which are frequented by lions and large herds of deer. It is crossed by a stone bridge at the town of Dizful, and is fordable in several places near Dizful during the summer and autumn.. This river has no positive name in the province ; the Arabs call it Shatt-ul-Diz. Selby considers this river might be made extremely useful. Being extremely tortuous, and having very little current and being well wooded, and the Arab tribes of A1 Kathir and 'Anafijah all along its banks, being extremely friendly and well disposed, it presents great en couragement and facilities for steam navigation. (Layard — Selby.) It is one of the high roads into the very heart of Persia, and the civi lisation of the country demands that it should be opened to traffic : the country it traverses is healthy and fertile: friendly tribes inhabit it. All considerations point to it and the Karun as a means whereby our political and commercial interests may be increased. The “Assyria” ascended (February) the Ab-i-Dizful to the vicinity ol Kala Bandar, the soundings averaging 3 fathoms. Nothing215 under 6 feet was met with. Here obstructions were encountered ; and, although at this season the river can be ascended several miles higher, the current becomes very rapid, and the pebbly bottom increases the difficulty of disengaging a vessel which has run aground. At Kala Bandar the natural band running half across the river increases its current. In April the current is always rapid, and tracking up is a work of labour. From the Tang-i-Bahrain, the point at which the two western arms of the river, after junction, enter the Luristan hills, the Dizful river forces its way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its hank is utterly impracticable : indeed, this part of the range is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird : it is followed by Iliyats on foot: it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most difficult of all the mountain pathways. It breaks into the Sahna-i-Lur between the hill forts of Tangawan and Kala-i-Shahi. Sf Haw lift son.) This river is crossed at Dizful by a brick bridge of twenty-one or twenty-two arches. No span of greater width than 30 feet. Arches both rounded and pointed : bridge 430 yards long : roadway fit for one line of traffic in bad repair. Up stream the river is used to turn many flour mills; 5th April 1884, it was in flood, and 400 to 500 yards wide rapid current. Near the point where the Ab-i-Dizful leaves the mountains is the celebrated Diz-i-ShahL The river is again met with at about 18 miles south of Burujird at Chulan Chulan (q.v.) A good mule road traverses the well cultivated valley of the Ab-i- Dizful ; soil clay; wheat growing 2 inches high; 22nd April, barometer 24 , 8 / ' (5,350 feet). The general run of the valley here is 140° and 340°. Nearing the river the valley becomes very swampy, and for 1 mile horses and mules found the greatest difficulty in traversing it, sinking over their fetlocks into the sticky clay at each step. Ford over the river Diz, 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet deep; current swift, 250 feet to 300 feet wide. There are here the remains of a masonry bridge, of which four arches only are now standing. Beyond the bridge the river valley is swampy ; barometer 25 , 0 /! ' (4,870 feet). The river is generally fordable except after rain. The valley is bordered on either hand by hills similar to those crossed, those to the east being less in height by 200 feet to 300 feet; those to west are still snow-topped. The river Diz traverses it in a south-easterly direction for 13 miles, where, joined by the Kemendab, it turns to the south and breaks through the hills at the Tang-i-Bahrain, whence a Bakhtiaii road, via Lanjonr, leads by seven stages to Shustar.

It is situated a few miles from-tlxe foot of the hills on uneven and stony ground, forming the com mencement of those vast plains which stretch towards Hawizah and the Shatt-ul-Arab. It is the principal market of Khuzistan. Its bazar is inferior, the merchants offering their goods for sale chiefly in caravansarais or in their own houses. Its population may be about 15,000, although it is generally believed to amount to 20,000. Its houses are not so well built as those of Shustar, and the streets are narrower. Salads, Mujtahids, and Mullas have very considerable power here, and are very forward in creating tumults and dissensions. The inhabitants are bigoted and remarkably punctual in the observance of the ceremonies and duties of their religion, and are divided into as many parties as there are chiefs, the consequence of which is that fre quent disturbances take place which generally terminate in bloodshed. Dizful can furnish abundant supplies, and, being in a salubrious climate, would serve as an admirable base for operations against Persia by Khuramabad. The prince governor, Miraz-ud-daula, makes it his head-quarters when in the low country, and leaves a lieutenant there when he retires to Khuramabad. Telegraphic communication between Tihran and Shus tar, via Dizful, is completed, but the line is a bad one and not likely to last. The revenue of Dizful, together with that of the Kathir Arabs, of whom there are 5,000 tributary to Dizful, consists of about 30,000 tumans, of which 24,000 are f&lt; Diwan” and 6,000 “ Pishkash.” “ Diwan's being that portion of the revenue that goes to Tihran and “ Plshkash” that which the prince governor takes for himself.

It is of Sassanian construction, but a good deal damaged. The upper portion, of brick, is of more recent date evidently than the lower portion, which is of stone work. {Layard—Monteith—Rawlinson— Kmneir William—Selby—Lynch— Wells—Baring—Schindler—Riva- deneyra — Ross.) Bell, April 1884, writes :—At Dizful the party were the guests of the resident W azir, Haji Hashim, a very perfect specimen of a Persian official and gentleman. He promised great things, but performed nothing; he would permit nothing to be bought, yet starved the horses. Notwithstanding the reserve that is imposed upon a guest, it was necessary to break through it and to remark in uumistakeable terms upon conduct so calculated to render himself, his office, and the nation he represented despicable in the eyes of a stranger. Shustar and Dizful are but ruined cities; here, as elsewhere, one meets with the same complaints of no government, no trade no security, and, indeed, it was only necessary to look around on the rich but uncultivated soil, on the ruins of towns and villages, the want of population, the rivers without traffic, the canals falling into disuse, &amp;c., &amp;c., to judge of the extent of the decadence of a once well popu! lated and fertile region, and to attribute it to the misgovernment so loudly and openly complained of by men of all classes and professions, even in the presence of the rulers responsible for the downfall of their country. “If the Sbah robs, why should not we?” is the question asked by the extoi tiouate Ivlians and 'W azirs who oppress the agricul™ turist, and the hill robbers who plunder the caravans. The locust blight of Moslem misrule has converted a garden of Eden into a desolate wilderness. In the spring of the year, assumed to extend to the 15th April, the weather is agreeably pleasant and much cooler than at Muhammarah and along the coast of the Gulf. During the first week in April the morning temperature, 9 a.m., will*y&gt;' mz —diz not often exceed 60°, and the shade temperature during the mid-day 75°. The nights are cold; no ill effects are experienced from exposure to the sun’s rays during the day-time provided Spring. t p at t h e head be well covered; the clothing required is the same as that worn during an English spring. Such being the character of the spring months of the year, the autumnal months may be assumed to resemble Autumn. t h em SO mewhat in character and salubrity. Towards the beginning of December, the climate is trying on account of the great difference of temperature between Summer. t he cold of the night and morning and the heat of the mid-day. The worst months of the year for heat are June, July, and August. The heavy rains fall during Winter. ear ]y spring of the year, but from all accounts are not excessive, and probably do not exceed 15 inches dining the year. They cease at the end of February, commencing in Decem ber (see om). . Sir H. Rawlinson mentions that the maximum heat of an up-stair room in Dizful was in the end of May, i.e , about a fortnight after the great heat had fairly set in, 130°, and that he, as well as the rest of the inhabitants, then retired during the day to the sarddbx, or sub terranean caverns excavated in the solid rock 30 feet to 40 feet below the surface. The hot wind, or simoon, does not probably equal in in tensity that of India. Emerging, from these caverns at sunset, they sleep on the roof. In June, under a double awning, the thermometer rises to 113°. From Shustar and Dizful a cool climate can be reached in two days, for within the hills are the summer quarters of the Sanitaria. Illyats, where cattle and sheep in abundance, and other provisions in small quantities, can be obtained. At Dizful barometer, after heavy storm of rain and wind,—29'1 inches. 4th April 1884.

The trade of both Shustar and Dizful has dwindled to insignificant proportions. There is no activity in the bazar of either town from remediable causes already explained, and the extortion and want of security inseparable from an Oriental despotism. In my presence, and in the presence of theNaib Wazir and Deputy Governor, it was openly stated that no government, or justice, or rule of any sort existed ; that exactions and insecurity of property had ruined all trade, and that any invader who could change the existing order of things would be welcomed with joy. The alternative road from Shustar passes through the village of 218219 Kaounek (6 farsakhs from Dizful), where Darab Khan, a Bakhfia,-i of Kal'a-i-Tul, with a section of the tribe, resided in 1882.

The houses of the town are well built of stone or mud, chiefly the Town. former; roofs flat; the rooms are fairly lofty and spacious, and built round a courtyard sur rounded by high walls. The majority of the houses are provided with “ sard-abs. The outskirts of the town are in ruins; the centre portion is well preserved; the streets are narrow and dirty, with a deen narrow centre rut adding to their impassability. Carts could not ‘traverse them • laden mules and donkeys with difficulty pass each other. There is a sanitary feature of the towns of Muhammarah, Shustar, and Dizful worthy of note. It is that the streets are also open drains and Insanitary condition. ress-pits. The latiines consist of openings in the roofs of the houses communicating directly by ducts through the outer walls with the streets. Persians seem not to object to this insanitary state of affairs and to be unconscious of the odours arising from it, for no less than three such outlets face the apartments of the palace occupied daily by the Prince During the Prince's absence Major Bell was offered the use of his apartments, but was compelled to excuse himself the honour. If it were not for this insanitary arrangement, Dizful would furnish excellent billets. The number of its houses is said to be between 3,500 and 4,000. Ophthalmia seems prevalent at both Shustar and Dizful. Owing to the narrowness of the streets and the solid nature of the Defence. houses, a defensible enceinte could readily be constructed on the sides exposed to a land attack, and for the same reasons a bombardment would occasion little or no loss. Supplies, &amp;c. The supplies (said to be between 10,000 and river water is of excellent quality; plentiful; population about 10,000 20 , 000 ).220 DIZ—DIZ Camp. The best cam ping-ground for troops lies to the north of the bridge near the Prince's pleasure-house. Its inhabitants are mostly Persians. The Persian dress consists of a shirt of cotton or silk and loose pyjamah-like Inhabitants and dress. trousers roullc [ the waist, of cloth or cotton. Over these is worn a tight, collarless garment, of chintz, with sleeves loose from the elbow (the alkaluk). Over the latter is worn a cloth tunic (or of cotton) with a stand-up collar, buttoning down the front, and pleated at the waist. The tunics worn by officials reacb to the knee; those worn by merchants are much longer ; merchants much affect the aid. The peasants wear blue cottons, and for warmth felt cloaks half an inch thick. The kamarband is almost universally worn out of doors. Turbans are worn by priests and merchants. Saiads wear green pagrls. The usual head-dress is the hat of black cloth, or sheep skin, on a frame-work of paste-board, of various heights. It was said that the chief supply of cotton and coloured piece-goods came from Bombay via Muhammarah, and thence by land; but that broadcloth was chiefly Russian broadcloth was said to be cheaper and Their cottons are also said to be stronger. No opium is grown in the neighbourhood, the principal product being indigo. There are 120 indigo factories in Dizful, which turn out on an average 2imaunds a day each, the yearly produce being estimated at between 700 to 800 kharwars, the kharwar containing 100 Tabriz maunds, or about 650 lbs. It is said that both soil and climate are extremely favourable to the production of indigo, and did the people only understand the preparation better, a considerable trade would spring up. As it is, lime and other in gredients are used in its preparation, and the quality is thus greatly deteriorated. (Baring.) Asad Khan is at present Governor of the Bizful district (April 1884). The revenue of the town and district amounts to 40,000 tumans. Trade. received from Russia, better than English. Opium. Tomb of David and mounds of Shush or Susa (ancient capital of Susiana ). The tomb of David, situated on the river Shaour or Shawur, is one stage, of 15 miles, from Dizful. Crossing the bridge, a well-cultivated plain, intersected by numerous watercourses, is crossed, till the Arab village of Shouhour is reached. Rice is largely grown in the vicinity, and the road is in places deep in mud. After passing an affluent of the Ab-i-Diz (Balarud), the ground gets drier. Passing an imamzada set in trees, and crossing another stream, the tomb is reached. The country is well covered with shrubs of tamarisk and aspen and the Salix Babylonica, half willow, half poplar; it abounds in game, francolin, hares, geese, quail, rock partridge, and wild boar being plentiful. There are also said to be lions in the forest that here skirts221 the banks of the Karkhah stream. The Arabs are of the 'All Rathir 01 Kessir tribe ; they are not nomads, and do not enjoy a good reputa tion An escort is always necessary from Dizful, and at times the country cannot be traversed without great risks. There is a small Arab village near the tomb. Grass. T ^ e surrounding country is noted for its beautiful herbage. The mounds of Shush are overgrown with brushwood and thistles hrom them Dizful is visible, bearing N. 38° E. ; they are 6| miles trom the river; the country becomes very difficult after rain. The Shawur river, although only 10 yards wide when swollen, must be forded at Amm-el-Timmen or Ammat-ul-Zimmen, 16 miles below the tomb. DIZ-I-SHAHl or KALA-I-DIZ or DIZ— Rat. Long. Elev. A stronghold in Khuzistan, situated near the river of Dizful and about a day's journey north-east of the town in the possession of the Duraki division of the Haft Lang Bakhtiarls. It consists of a plain, about 15 miles in circumference, forming the summit of a lofty hill_, the sides of which are almost perpendicular and only to be ascend ed by a steep and difficult pathway, which may easily be defended or perhaps totally destroyed. As water is abundant on it, and flocks have been conveyed to the summit of the Diz, villages have been built on this tableland and form the ordinary place of residence of the Duraki tribe. The soil is rich and under cultivation, producing grain of various kinds, therefore little chance of such a place suffering from a siege by Persian troops, though it would probably be unable to with stand the attacks of a European force. {Layard.) Bell say it is a natural stronghold of the Bakhtiari chief, two marches north-east of Dizful, 3 miles in circumference with perpendi cular, inaccessible sides, well supplied with water and with a few acres of arable land and good pasture. Bobertson and Stack say it is a stronghold situated in the hills about 18 miles from Dizful. It consists of an elevated tableland of considerable extent, with perpendicular sides, nowhere less than 150 feet high. There is a single artificial path to the top, where there are some huts, habitable caves, and springs of water with cultivation. . There is g° od grazing on the top, and sheep are hoisted up an inclined plane of poles in order to take advantage of it. Regarding natural fortresses of this kind, known by the local name of ‘‘ Diz/’ Bell says :—“ At intervals, where the elevating force which produced the present configuration of the Luristan 'region* has acted with extreme intensity, the continuity of the beds become broken, and masses of rock were left standing isolated, with precipi tous escarpments presenting retreats accessible only to its inhabi tants. They frequently bear on their summits acres of rich grass and springs of delicious water, whither a native chief with his ad herents can retire in case of need.' DIZ-I-SIAH. Fide Khuramabad.DIZ MALIKAN—Lat. . Long. _ Elev. ^ A fort in Luristan in the Bakhtiari mountains to the noith of the Kama river north-east of Shustar, 5 6 miles. It is a mass of rock, about 3 miles in circumference, which rises out of the centre of a vast basin formed by lofty surrounding hills, and whose perpendicular sides overtop the neig'hbourino' mountains. From the bottom of these c l™£&gt; the detutus slopes rapidly to a considerable distance, and even the cliffs themse ves cannot be approached if this slope be in any way defended. _ The cliffs are naturally inaccessible. The rock is a conglomerate in which a limestone, abounding with small fossil shells and ammonites is chiefly conspicuous. The summit has only one accessible point, and that can be defended without difficulty, even by one person, when the approaches are not destroyed. The ascent is made by a very long ladder and small steps, or rather holes, cut in the rock. When this ladder is re moved, all communication with the summit is cut off. The Diz is divided into Upper and Lower. The ascent from the lower to the Upper is equally precipitous and difficult. The Lower Diz consists of a small platform on which there are three springs of water and a few huts. This is the usual residence of the chief. The Upper Diz is without water, except that which may be collected in reservoirs during the winter rains. It contains a few acres of good arable land, which are frequently under cultivation. About 3,000 lbs. of seed may be raised without artificial irrigation. Sheep and goats have been conveyed to the sum mit, and beasts for the plough, when needed, are raised by ropes. It is not extraordinary that a natural fort of such strength should have defied the regular troops of Persia for centuries. There is little doubt but the summit might be reached by shells and the crops easily de stroyed. The approach, however, to the Diz from every quarter is * exceedingly difficult, and the mountain passes might, if defended with skill and courage, be held against any number of men. The springs in it are not abundant, and are probably incapable of supplying any large body of men. Wheat and other necessaries are always kept in store, and several flocks find pasture on the summit: so precipitous are the cliffs that even the mountain goats cannot descend them. It belongs to the Baidarwand division of the Haft Lang Bakhtiaris. It is also called Diz Azad Khan. (Layard.) Elev. to the Mamasenis, DIZ MARDAN—Lat. Long. A hill fort in Ears, near Bihbahan.

A village of fift}^ houses in the Bakhtiari mountains in Luristan, 94 miles from Isfahan on the road to Shushtar, via Ardal. The Kuh-i- Zebzi stream falls inio the Karun just opposite this village. The former is crossed by a common country bridge, but the latter by a solid brick one, consisting of one small and one large arch (length 20 yards). There is plenty of good water, but no supplies here. {Baring — Wells.) DORAK or EELLAHlAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the province of Khuzistan, on the left bank of the Jarahi river, 44 miles above its mouth, and the chief place of the Shaikh of the K/ab Arabs. It is situated in a low marshy plain on the banks of two of the branches of the Jarahl. The walls are 2 miles in circum ference, built of mud, 16 feet in thickness, and flanked at regular in tervals with round towers. There are but few houses within the walls, as the majority of the people, who in all may amount to 8,000, prefer living in the suburbs under the shade of the date trees. The palace of the Shaikh covers a large space of ground, but it is in reality a very miserable structure, built of bricks dried in the sun and falling rapidly to decay. Dorak is celebrated for its manufacture of the aba (or Arab cloak), which are exported in great numbers all over Persia and Arabia. The trade of the place is but trifling, but what there is is carried on by means of the Dorak canal with Muhammarah and Basra, whence it is sometimes called Little Basra. The bazars of this town are very indifferently supplied. Dr. Colville, who visited this place in 1863, says it is difficult to form an idea of the size of Dorak, for the place is not only straggling in itself, but there are so many date trees that you cannot see it all at once. The houses are principally made of reeds, only a few are of sun-dried bricks. There is a broken down mud wall, with ruined bastions made to enclose a much larger town. Between the wall and the town is all swamp; beyond all marsh. The whole affair looks like a bad edition of Baghdad on a small scale. 223DOR—DOR The bazar is a miserable place, built of sun-dried bricks, imperfectly covered with matting. There are not above twenty shops in it: most of them being in reed huts. The people are very like the Madan Arabs on the banks of the Tigris, but better dressed and more sickly. All the men wear black turbans, and carry long flintlocks manufactured in Baghdad. There do not appear to be more than 200 houses in the town itself, but the suburbs are populous. The climate here is said to be very bad; for three months in the winter it is endurable, but in the hot weather it is dreadful; Basra,—about the worst climate in the world, is said to be a paradise to it. In the hot season, during the day, the wind is hot and moist, and the water is hot, and there is no means of cooling it; in the night the people lie panting for breath. Fever com mits great ravages from the time of the cutting of the dates to the falling of the first rain, that is, from July to December, and then the inhabitants, it is said, die in hundreds, especially the Persians. The prin cipal diseases are ulcers, cariesbone, rheumatism, ophthalmia, and fever. Dorak exports some wool and Arab cloaks, and from 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rice in vessels of 50 to 60 tons burthen. It is said that 1,000 of these boats might be collected from the Jarahi river alone at Dorak, if needed for military operations. Dorak is connected with the Karun river by means of the Dorak, or Shakha canal, which joins the Karuu 2 miles above Kusbah. It is, however, now so far filled up as to be navigable only by such boats as can be occasionally dragged over the mud. Formerly a canal went from Sama Ainleh, or Ismailiah, south-east to Dorak. It is now filled up. The district of Fellahiah, or Dorak, is supposed to contain a popu lation of 30,000. The total revenue is 22,000 tumans; i.e., 16,000 tumans “diwan” (to head government) and 6,000 “ pishkash,” which the prince governor takes for himself. This district and that of Hawizah are remnants of independent Arab principalities, which were powerful in their days, and their chiefs or governors are always members of the old ruling families, the Muali of Hawizah and the Abu Nasir of Fellahiah. It is necessary that the governor should be acceptable to both Prince and people, for the Shaikhs of the tribes will not pay tribute to a chief who has been placed over them in opposition to their wishes, and the marshes of the district afford handy refuge to the discontented. The following tribes are tributary to Fellahiah :— Al-bu-lbadi. „ Ali. Ghubaish. „ Haiab. „ Hamadi. „ Haji All. „ Naim. ’Asurkirah. ’Atgiyah. Bani Khalid. Daradishah. Hazbah. Haiadir. Khanafirah.

A ruined caravansarai in Ears, about 38 miles from Bihbahan, by compass and distance, in the direction of Shiraz. It is near a spring of water in a perfectly wild and desert place. {DeBode.) Wells, December 12th, 1881, says Dugumbazan is 42| miles from Bihbahan, on road to Shiraz. Kuh-i-Huma, or Kuh-i-Dil, must be at least 10,000 feet high, and looks well from the plain on which Dugumbazan stands. They say the stream from this plain is lost in a marsh. The water from the snows of Kuh-i-Dil mostly goes down the Shams-ul-Arab, a neighbouring stream. This is the first village since leaving Bihbahan. It possesses a ruined mud fort with two towers. Lions are said to be numerous in the vicinity. DUK HTAR-WAJlH—Lat. Long. Elev. A deep broad ravine in Khuzistan, about 35 or 40 miles from Dizful, on the road from Jaidar. (Bawlinson.) DUKUH—Lat.

DU WARI—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, formed by two streams rising in the hills, usually occupied by the Lur tribe of Sagwand, which unite in the lower part of the small plain of Patak, and thence forces its way through the sandstone hills, and after winding for a few miles in the plain, in which it is joined by a small stream called Bograb ; it loses itself in a marsh before reaching the Tigris. {Layard.)

This place is about mid-way between Asupas and Kuh-i-Dinah, and is inhabited by Circassians (Charkas) settled here in the time of Shah Abbas the Great. The assessment of the village consists of a poll-tax of 10 kirans, and fths of all produce; and no man is allowed to sow his own seed, or sow his land till it has been measured out to him. The revenues go to the U-begi of the Kashkais. {Durand.) E EKLID ,—vide Aklid.FADHlLAH— A tnbe of Khuzistan living in tents in the neighbourhood of the arun, and numbering 250 adult males.

A ruined castle in Fars, about 2 miles east of Shiraz,* situated on a mountain, the extreme summit of which was once covered with its walls. {Ouseley.) FAHLIUN—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Ears, 72 miles north-west of Shiraz. It is situated in the onaii Eivan valley, at the northern base of the hills beyond which lies Nurabad. In the winter months narcissus grows here in great abundance. DeBode describes it as a paltry little town of at most sixty or seventy houses, but enclosed by walls now in ruins, which show that it was formerly not quite so insignificant. It is supplied with water by a canal cut through the hills from the snow-capped chain beyond .Kala Safid for a distance of 14 miles. It is surrounded by fine palm trees, and has a fort in ruins on the summit of a small hill. As a precipice rises close behind the town, it is probable that the heat in summer must be intolerable. Supplies of grain and cattle can be obtained here, and wood is procurable from the Bakhtiari tribes in the neighbourhood. The district of Fahliun, which formerly extended from Munmahl on the south to Basht on the north-west, and from Ardakan on the east to Khisht on the south-west, has been encroached upon by the Mama- senl, who by degrees have made themselves masters of all the arable land formerly possessed by the inhabitants of Fahliun, who complain bitterly of the exactions to which they are subjected. The water of the Abshor being, as its name implies, brackish, it can only be used for irrigating the fields. The soil here is very fertile and water abun dant, but hands are wanting for the cultivation of the land. The fields artificially irrigated yield from 25 to 40-fold in the winter crops ; the proportion is lower in the lands called ‘ dain * (debt) and ‘ bakhs y (deficiency), i.e., fields watered only by rain and dew, and not arti* ficially irrigated. Rice which is grown yields less than that which is planted, the produce of the latter being to that of the former in good years 150-fold. Sesamum is also cultivated here and yields 100-fold. The duties paid by Fahliun to the government of the province of Ears do not exceed £480. {DeBode — Jones.) FAHLIUN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in the same locality as above. It is shown as Ab-i-shor {q.v.) in St. John's map, and is also locally known by the names Rudian, Tang-i-khast, and Shaspir. It flows through the Talas pi d plain, in which the village Fahliun is situated. Rice fields seem to absorb the whole of the water, and numerous irrigation channels are to 227 15 a228 FA H—FAR be seen, notably the one leading to the head of this ^ Sarab-i-Siah valley. Near the mountain Kala Safid the Fahliun is joined by the Sul stream from the north, the mam stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast. It is 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep, flowing very rapidly. (Fw/tf Ab-i-Shur.) The name of a subdivision of the Mamaseni tribe, inhabiting the above district. The name of their chief in 1883 was Mirza Hadi. _ ( Wells — Baring.) FAHRAJ —Lat. Long. Elev. A large village 17 miles (Abbott says 30) from Yazd on the road to Bafk. It is beautifully shaded by mulberry trees, and its kanat brings cold snow water from Shirkah.

Consists of a few miser able mud huts, built on, and about, a mound on the right (west) side of valley, which is here about 6 to 8 miles broad. A beaten road leads to Shiraz. From here a road goes to Shiraz, distant 8 stages, or 160 miles, 5th June 1884. [Bell.) FALLAHIAH—Lat. Long. Elev. See Dorak. FALMAR—Lat. Long. Elev.

A lake in Fars, about 13 miles south-east of Kazran and 45 miles west of Shiraz. It is a long narrow sheet of fresh water, stretching north-west and south-east, about 3| miles long by half to one mile broad. On its south side it is very shallow, but it is said to be beyond a man's depth in the centre. It occupies the north side of a beautiful vale, bounded by lofty and rocky mountains on both hands, and is fed on its south-east extremity, where the village of Famur is situated. There is excellent grazing on the banks of the lake, which is sometimes known as the Daria-i-Parisban. [MacGregor — Abbott.) FANl (KHtJZISTAN) —Lat. Long. Elev.

Long. Elev. A village situated in a narrow valley between •’Aliabad and Taft, near the western road from Shiraz to Yazd, and 21 miles from the latter. It has about 53 houses and plenty of fruit and water. {MacGregor.) FARRASHBAND—Lat. Long. Elev. 2,400'. A village in Fars, about 63 miles south-east of K&amp;zran, 84 miles east of Bushahr, and 30 miles west of Firuzabad. It is a large village embosomed in palm groves and situated in the plain of the same name. This plain runs in a direction north-west and south-east, and is said to be about 30 miles in length by 4 miles in breadth. It has a fort and 800 huts. Its soil is generally very free from stones, and its surface is extensively cultivated. It is a fine tract, but so ill- watered as to depend for moisture almost entirely on rain. This being uncertain, the produce of the field varies greatly; wheat and barley seem alone to be raised. The land is never manured or left fallow; but when new spots are cultivated, the produce is said to be as high as 30 or 40-fold, though in ordinary cases on old ground it would only be 10 or 12-fold. There are about five or six villages in this plain, which on the south is bounded by Dashti and on the north-west by Kuh Marah. It was formerly a well-inhabited tract, and furnished a considerable military contingent, but from various causes it has declined since the reign of Karim Khan, Zand. Considerable supplies are procurable here, as well as cattle for slaughter and burden; the latter chiefly asses. Rice, fuel, and ghl can be procured from the nomads in the vicinity. Jones says good water is procured from hill springs, but Abbott remarks on the want of water. There is good pasturage for cattle round here. A road branches off from this place to Shiraz via Giri, by which in the war of 1856 the Persians brought down 12-poun der guns. {Abbott — Jelly — Jones.) Farrashband is one of the great grazing districts of Persia, and there are considerable herds of cattle, in which a trade has sprung up of late. {Burundi) The town belongs to the Mashir, and was formerly a much more important place than it is at present. Tradition has it that it used to stretch along the foot of the Kuh-i-Nissar, which is south-west, for about 15 miles. There are some ruins which give some colour to this very doubtful statement. {Durand.) FARS—Lat. Long. Elev. A province of Persia, bounded on the north by Irak, east by Karman and Lar, west by Khuzistan, and south by the Persian Gulf. It lies 229230 FAR—PAR between £7° 20' and 31° 41' latitude, and longitude 49° 20' and 54° 20', and has the shape of a quadrilateral, each side of which is nearly 220 miles long. It has a superficial area of 44,335 geographical square miles. This province is divided into the Garmsir and Sardsir, or the warm and the cold climates : the former is that tract which extends from the sea to the latitude of Kazran, and runs parallel with the Gulf from the banks of the Tab to the confines of Luristan. The cultivation of the Dashtistan, or sandy plain, at the foot of the moun tain entirely depends on the periodical rains, and, consequently, when they prove abundant, the country yields a fair proportion of dry grain ; but when there is failure in the rains, which unfortunately happens too often, the produce is so deficient that a famine gener ally ensues. The Dashtistan is divided into the districts of Lirawl and Hiadonat, (?) which are separated from each other by the projecting mountain of Bang. They are thinly peopled and badly cultivated, and the few mud villages which here and there appear like spots on the plain bespeak at first sight the wretchedness and poverty of their possessors. The Sardsir, or cold climate, comprehends most of the mountainous parts of Fars, extending from the latitude of Kazran to that of the town of Yazdikhast, situated on the bed of what appears to have been formerly a river, which separates this province from Irak. The plains which here intersect the mountains seldom exceed 8 or 10 miles in breadth, but vary in length from 15 to 100. They are in general fertile, afford abundance of pasturage, and are not so deficient in water as is commonly supposed ; and it is the want of population and the little encouragement given to industry which alone retard their improvement. A few of these plains, such as those of Shiraz, Kaz ran, and Marvdasht, are however tolerably well cultivated, but they are, for the most part, and particularly to the north and west, desti tute of inhabitants. Between Bihbahan and Shiraz there are upwards of GO miles of the most delightful valleys, covered with wood and verdure, but all is solitary, not the face of a human being was any where to be seen. These valleys had been possessed by an ancient tribe which, in consequence of their licentious conduct, had been nearly extirpated by the orders of the prince, and the few that survived had taken refuge on the summits of the loftier and most inaccessible mountains, where they subsisted on a wretched kind of bread made from acorns, and, from thence sallying forth, infested the roads and rendered travelling extremely dangerous. The face of the country in the eastern part of Fars, towards Darabgird and Fasa, is somewhat different: there it is more open, the plains are of greater extent, the soil more sandy, and water less plentiful. The great range of mountains seen from the coast is a mere elong ation of the chain of Mount Zagros, not a separate range, but con nected with that mountainous tract which extends, in a continued succession of ridges, from the borders of the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. ^ ^ 1S are . s ^ ua ted at different distances from the sea. At Bushahi they are distant about 24 miles.

(?) This projecting point is known by the name of “ Kuh- i-BangA It is of no great height, and in breadth about 7 or 8 miles. Beyond this hill lies the plain of Lirawi. Here again the mountains are about 20 miles from the sea, at which distance they continue for 8 or 9 miles, when they again approach the south and form a circle in the neighbourhood of Bandar Dilam. This low and advanced branch is known by the name of Zaitun, from a small town not far from Bihbahan. On turning the southern point of the hills of Zaitun, they again abruptly retire to the north. At the port of Mashur they are 30 miles from the sea, and at Shustar their most southern extremity crosses the thirty-second degree of north latitude in the forty-ninth degree of east longitude. Fars contains the salt lakes of Bakhtigan and Dariachate, which are in the neighbourhood of Shiraz; there is also a fresh-water lake in the plain of Zardan. The principal streams are the Band Amir with its tributaries, the Pulvar and Kiir, the Mund, Kara Agach, the Nabon, (?) and the higher parts of the two branches of the Tab. Towards the north Madar- i-Snllman marks the tomb of Cyrus, and to the west are the ruins of Kala Safld, and nearly in the centre are those of the ancient capital, Persepolis.

The manufactures are arms, cutlery, glass-ware, ornamented pen-cases, silver and gold kalians, tobacco pipes, cotton cloths, cotton and woollen stockings, wine, &amp;c. • Felly gives the following list of the districts of Fars, the details of which will be found under their titles :— “ Ahadi-i-Surnieri, situated north of Shiraz; Abadi-i-Tashtak, situated north-east of Shiraz; Ardakan, situated west of Shiraz; Aklul north; Yazd-i-Khast north ; Abreh north ; Abneh west; Assiod and Ala Merdasht north ; Afzar and Kunj north ; Astabane east; Arbaa south ; Dehneh ; Bezah north-west; Bavunat north; Joyum and Bideshahr south; Jarah west; Jahrum south; Takht-i-Jamshld north-east; Khisht and Kumarij west; Khajeyi south; Khafr east; Jeriz and Assengan north-east; Darabgird east; Dasbtistau south east ; Dashti south ; Bamjard north ; Romiz and Fasa east; Chardanga north ; Siakh west; Semirun and Dizgard north-west; Sarvistan east; Shul and Dilkhan west; Shulistan west; Kala Safld north-west: Simekun north; Flruzabad south ; Paul and Galedar south ; Farrashband south ; Keiferi north ; Kkushmareh south-west; Kever east; Kiilbar east; Kazran west; Kenun north ; Mashud Nabi north; Maimand south; and Maim and Kondazi north.” {Felly.) [A. F. No means are at hand for correcting the spelling of the maiority of the above names.] J J The present governor of Fars (1881) is Zill-us-Sultan, Masaud Mlrza, the eldest son of the Shah. He succeeded Mutamad-ud-daula, Farhad Mlrza, the Shah/s uncle. Under the latter’s regime, the pro vince of Fars is said to have become much depleted and in many dis tricts visibly on the downward track, but robbery and crime were stern ly suppressed, and the roads became safe. In fertile valleys villages are passed which once numbered their hundreds, but are now reduced to five or six squalid huts. Inquiry as to the causes of this always elicits the same explanation,—“ Zulm,” i.e., “ tyranny.” The governor’s233 young son, Jalal-ud-Daula, resides at Sliiraz as Deputy Governor. The population of this province consists of the Dihati, or Dih-Nishln ele ment, and that of the “ Iliyat,” or Chadar Nishins,” in other words of settled, and nomad, inhabitants. The former are sometimes supposed to be derived from the aboriginal race who were in the country before the Aryan invasion; but they are now composed of many breeds, Irani Arab, and Turkish, and even Chartas or Circassian. The latter are also very mixed, being Irani, Arab, Turkish, and, as popularly sup posed, Bactrian, the last being the Bakhtiarl. The Lak tribe of the Irani Illyat are said to have no longer a name among the nomads, but to have been absorbed into the town popula tions. The Arab Illyat are for the most part wanderers in parts of Bars as yet unexplored by Europeans. They are nomadic and dangerous in the extreme. Their summer quarters are in the hills of Baonat and other places in the country between Shiraz and Yazd. The Turkish Illyat, comprising the Kashkal, once a power in Ears, are now poor and broken, and too near to the central power in Shiraz to have much chance of regaining their former status and wealth. Rob bery is the legitimate trade of every man in Ears, from Kajar prince to Sur shepherd. It is plied according to the personal courage and official opportunities of each man. A wholesome dread of the Shahza- dah (the prince-governor) alone saves Ears from becoming a pan demonium. The present chief of the Kashkal is Darab Khan, a stern task-master, a pretended bigot, and one more feared than liked by all- The -late chief of the Bakhtlari was Husain Kull Khan, known to be greatly in favour of throwing open the Karun river to trade, and a friend to Europeans, the present (1884) one being Imam Kull Khan, vide BakhtIabIs. Generally speaking, the products of Ears are as follows Vegetable— fruits, opium, grain, oranges, limes, cotton. Minerals —Sulphur, lead, red and yellow ochre, naphtha. Animals —Horses, sheep, mules, asses. Articles of manufacture, chiefly at Shiraz —Arms, cutlery, glass-ware, ornamental pen-cases, silver and gold pipes, cotton cloths, cotton and woollen stockings, and wine of two sorts. The following information regarding the pack transport available in the province of Ears is extracted from Colonel Rosses Report No. 27, dated 22nd March 1884. « Camels.—Vxice at ordinary times Rs. 60 to 80; rate of hire | rupee per diem.

The district of kasa extends east and west about 45 miles, and varies in breadth fiom 9 to 15 miles. Its villages and hamlets amount in number to 33, and its productions are chiefly barley and wheat; 5 to 12 -fold is the ordinary yield. Indian-corn, millet, sesame seed, and tobacco; cotton and rice are produced in small quantities. The country comes generally under the denomination of Garm Sir, or warm region.

It is owing to this circumstance, and to their residing in the vicinity of the large towns of Karmanshah, Burujird, and Khu- ramabad, that the tribes of the Pish Kuh are more under the control of the government than those of the Pusht-i-Kuh, while the latter recognise the authority of the Wall of Luristan; the former are placed under a local governor sent either from Karmanshah or Isfahan. The four tribes of the Pish Kuh are generally at war with each other. They are notorious for their plundering propensities, particularly the Dilfan and the Silah Silah. The country they inhabit can seldom be traversed with safety either by single travellers or caravans. The tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh are under a Wall, whose ancestors were the chiefs of all the Feili Lurs. Lur-i-Kuchak was formerly included in the government of Karmanshah, but it is now in that of Isfahan. The usual residence of the governor of the Pish Kuh is either at Khuramabad or in the plain of Saimarah. It is very difficult to form a correct estimate of the forces that can be raised from Lur-i-Kuchak. The Wali may probably be able to collect between 4,000 and 5,000 men, of whom 500 or 600 are horsemen. The gross amount of armed men that might be raised in Luristan may, perhaps, be between 4,000 and 5,000 horsemen and 20,000 matchlockmen. The Feili pretend to have more respect for an oath and to be less blood-thirsty than their neighbours the Bakhtiaris, but there is really little difference in this respect. The Feili supply the towns of Karmanshah, Hamadan, Burujird, and Khuramabad with charcoal. They also, particularly the Dilfan sections, possess a very fine breed of mules, which are much esteemed in Persia, being large, strong, capable of carrying great weights and enduring much fatigue. ( Layard.) The Yiwetiwands and Muminawands supply at present a body of 350 infantry to the Crown. The Pish Kuh are assessed at 40,000 tumans. The distribution of this sum of 40,000 tumans varies yearly, and it is impossible therefore to give the details. The -’Amalah tribe, however, who are offsets of all the other tribes, and were employed by the former Walls as their immediate servants, are very lightly charged, the culti vation of the Crown lands being accounted in lieu of taxation. The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh has the sole direction of his own revenues, and claims to account personally with the Karmanshah government for the assessment of his district. The Bajilan and Bairauawand tribes are refugees of the last century, from the vicinity of Mosul. They are lightly taxed, having to furnish a body of 1,200 horse to the Crown. The Hulilani tribes are now usually included in Karmaushah. They furnish 500 infantry. The •’Amalah are Dih-Nishins, who cultivate the Khalisah or Crown lands at Khuramabad, Saimarah, Tihan and Kuhdasht.They do not migrate at all. The total assessment of the Feili Lurs is given as 60,000 tumans. The most recent account of the Feilis is by ieutenant-Colonel Bell in 1884, who, in addition to what has been ascertained by former authorities, .reports as follows :— Lur-i-Kitchak, occupied by the Feili Lurs. The tribes occupying the Lur-i-Kuchak are generally known as the Feili, and are subdivided into the Pish-Kuh (north of the Kabir Kuh) and Pusht-i-Kuh (south of the Kabir Kuh). The Pish-Kuh are divided into four principal tribes—33,000 families in all. {Layard } 1846.) Bach tribe has its chief, who exercises unlimited authority over its members ; under him are tushmals, or chiefs of families, who are respon sible for the collection of the revenue, and for the good order and allegiance of those placed under their care. The chief himself accounts with the government. The members of a tribe hold their chiefs in great respect, and are, as a rule, observant of his wishes. He in turn considers their welfare, and their tushmals have con siderable influence in the general government. The tribe must, when the occasion demands it, arm and follow their chief in his wars. The inferior members of a tribe show their allegiance by kissing the hand of their chief. The chief will embrace men of influ ence. When a darbar is held, men of a certain standing sit; those of inferior quality stand roundabout; all freely give their opinions and advice, but in a quiet, orderly, and respectful manner, prefacing their remarks by “ May I be allowed to say,” &amp;c. The district has no supreme chief, and is under a local governor, who resides at Khuramabad, and is, at present, within the jurisdiction of the Government of Isfahan. Widely speaking, they inhabit the hills to the south of the line Kar- manshah, Khuramabad, Tang-i-Bahrain to the Kabir Kuh, and have as east and west boundaries the rivers Dizful and Karkhah. They graze their flocks on both banks of the latter river and on the plains border ing the foot of the Kabir Kuh. Through these hills runs the main commercial artery of the country, viz., the road Muhammarah, Dizful, Khuramabad, Burujird, Sultanabad, Kum, Tihran, and along their front, an important transverse line, by the valleys of the Dizful (Burujird branch), Kamandar-Ab, and Zaindarud (Afhus branch), connects Karmanshah with Isfahan. The Pusht-i-Kuh tribe is under the chieftainship of the descendants of Hasan Khan, their last powerful Wall. They are at enmity amongst themselves, and intrigues to gain precedence have led to many blood- feuds. The government does not desire that there should be union amongst the tribes, nor does it exert itself to bring them into proper subjection. Several of them are generally in open rebellion, and small parties of Lurs even cannot pass through their territory with impu nity.239 Of the three sons of Hasan Khan mentioned by Layard as having Chiefs. divided the tribes amongst them on the death of 4.1 - 4 . i • • . 1 ^ ie ^ r ^ a ^ ier ^ajl 'All Khan now eni'oys the chief authority, his principal adherents being the Sagwand subdivision of the Bajilan tribe ; the pretensions of Haidar Khan, the third son, to inherit the title of his father, were upheld by the Persian Governor of Luristan, whereupon the elder brothers, 'Ali Khan and Ahmad Khan, took refuge with the Assyrian Arabs on the Turkish frontier (DeBode). Eventually two or three years back, such is the instability of all things Lur, Sartip Haidar Khan of the Bairanwand was put to death by the Governor of cw a£ l t ? r havi l 1 f 1 hee P- mvited to Khuramabad to receive favours of the Shah; his sons follow in the wake of 'AH Khan, but are in no way attached to him, and consider that their misfortunes have been his oppor- tunity. Of these young men the elder is by no means a prepossessing youth ; the younger, quite a boy, has a face which attracts by reason of its look of quiet melancholy and resignation. They frequently visited Major Bell and related to him their misfortunes under the idea that he was a Sartip in the service of the Shah, whose good offices at Tihran might have served to bring them again into favour. At the time when the party were treated with little consideration by Hail 'All they offered tent room and hospitality. The Agent of the Zil-ul- Sultan with the tribe, not much liked by Hap 'Ali, advocated their rights, so it is quite possible that a turn of the wheel of fortune may yet bring these lads into prominence. Ahmad Khan, the second son, has a considerable following, and is at enmity with his brother, for like reasons, and in rebellion against the government. The chief of the Lurs about Karmanshah is Husain Kuli Khan, a lawless chief; in fact, anarchy reigns at the present time throughout Lur-i-Kuchak. The following is an account given of the Lur-i-Kuchak by Mr. Schindler, 1877. Mr. Schindler was in the service of the Shah and had good opportunities of gaining information. He states that there are 36 villages in Luristan; that the total assessment of the Pusht-i- Kuh and Pisb-i-Kuh is 6d,000 tumans, and the total number of families of the Pish-Kuh to be 39,550 families. He does not estimate the strength of the Pusht-i-Kuh. The boundaries of the Pish-Kuh are the Silakhor valley, the Bakhtiari country, the Dizful river, the Karkhah river, the province of Karmanshah and the districts of Kangawar and Naha wand. The Pish Kuh are divided according to their summer quarters as below : Families. The Duran ........ 4 900 SUah-SHah or Silsile Bala-Ghiwa . Hurud Tirhan ’Amalah 5.000 12,700 8,050 8.000 820 in all 39,550 families. Their two great divisions are the Gulek, subdivided into 'Amalah and Bala Giriwa and the Selewerzi, subdivided into Silah-Silah or Silsile and Dilfan. The 'Amalah (workmen) live chiefly in villages and are again subdivided into 30 families.240 The Bald Giriwa {i.e., those who live in the mountains) inhabit the wildest and most inaccessible parts of Luristan ; their southern frontier is the Dizful river, their northern boundary the river Kashgan ; the subdivisions are— 1 . Dirikawand, 30 branches, 2,000 families; inhabit the mountains on the borders of Arabistan. 2. Saki, extinct; massacred by the Dirikawand. 3. Judeki, 500 families; inhabit the valleys between the Bowi mountains and the Kialan. 4. Papi, 1,000 families, live near the Dziful river. 5. Kashnuwand, 200 families; live near Khuramabad. The above number in all 8,700 families; in 1836, Rawlinson estima ted them at 6,000 families, and Layard in 1846 at the same figure. The following are also classed as Bala Giriwa, viz.— 6 . Makan ’All, have joined the Sagwand. 7. Bajilan, 8 branches; one of the largest of the Lur tribes. 8 . Bairanawand; 18 branches and 7,000 families. They are classed by Bawlinson and Layard as dependencies. The Sildh-Sildh. 1. Ghijaswand, nearly extinct. 2. Hasanawand, 16 branches and 2,500 families: winter quarters in the Jaidar plain; summer quarters in the ’Alishtar plain. 3. Kuliwand, 3 branches; 2,500 families, inhabit the Khawah plain. 4. Yusuf wand, 16 families ; inhabit ’Alishtar; or, in all, 5,016 families. Rawlinson’s estimate (1836) was 15,000 families, and Layard's (1846) 10,000 families. Bilfdtl. 1. Muminawand, 12 branches, 2,100 families ; inhabit Tan g-i - Bad &amp; war. 2. Kakawand, 5 branches, 2,000 families; inhabit Darem-Rud, south of Karman- shah. 3. Imetivand (Yiwetlwand P), 10 branches, 500 families; inhabit south of Karmanshah. 4. ’Ainawand, 4 branches, 80 families, inhabit Tang-i-Parl; in all 4,190 families; Rawlinson’s estimate was (1836) 15,000 families, and Layard’s (1846) the same. Schindler gives no estimate of the'Pusht-i-Kuh, and his enumera tion of the Pish-Kuh would seem to be imperfect. There is no doubt, however, that intestine wars and famines, an extortionate government, &amp;c., have caused them to diminish in numbers, and not to increase. In 1884 HajI 'All Khan estimated that the Lurs numbered in all about 150,000 men. His estimate is valueless. Assuming that the Lurs in Lur-i-Kuchak number 50,000 families, and allowing five souls per family, its population would number 250,000. This fairly coincides with the estimate given on page 39 in Bell’s work on South-West Persia. The assessment of the tribes is fixed, in the case of the Bakhtiari, at . . a certain number of Katirs, a sum of money of Assessment. . , 1 varying value.The tribes cultivating the Crown lands about Khuramabad, Saimar- rah, Jaidar, Alishtar, Kuh-daslit^ Tlrhan, Kir-ab are taxed in both money and kind. There are also indirect means of raising revenue by systems of fees and fines for robberies, murders, and such like offences. The amount at which a Lur district is assessed being fixed, it is duly distributed over the tribes and their subdivisions; in a general council, and to the satisfaction of all, each subdivision determines the quota to be paid by its lesser subdivisions, camps, and villages, and then the Kat-khuda, Rlshsafld, or Tushmal of each collects from the different families under his rule according to his knowledge of their individual ability to contribute. The mules bred by the Feilis are considered to be superior to all Mules others in Persia; they can export 1,000 annually. (Rawlinson.) The price of a mule varies from 30 to 40 tumans (R120 to 160). They also manufacture carpets, packing-bags, horse furniture, char- Weaith Coa ^ ^ :C ■ , as w ith all Illyats, their chief wealth lies in their flocks of sheep and herds of goats, donkeys, horses, &amp;c. Their country also produces cheese, butter, char coal, cherry-sticks and otter skins. Their horses are of a mixed breed. There are few or none of pure Arab breed. The objection raised against the Shustar-Khuramabad route is that it passes through the district of Lur-i-Kuchak, and that the Lur robbers would, as heretofore, plunder the caravans, destroy the cara- vansarais and bridges built along it, and even the road itself.. The manner in which robbery has been put down in the Kuhgehlu hills shows how such can be put down. The lawlessness that now reigns throughout Lur-i-Kuchak is due to a succession of weak and rapacious governors. A just and firm governor, aided by a small body of troops to enforce his authority, would, within a few months, pacify the district. As a means to this end, the construction of the road and caravansarais, and the safe-con duct of caravans along it, are required. As the road is now quite passable, the first desiderata are—the construction of caravansarais, storing them with provisions, guarding them, and the stationing a sufficient number of troops in each to ensure the safe-conduct of a caravan from one sarai to the other. From Khuramabad to the Bala- Rud is 147 miles, or seven stages. Consequently seven caravansarais will have to be constructed and guarded. Stationing in each 100 infantry and 10 cavalrymen to guard the caravansarais and to furnish guards for the road, and keeping in hand a mobile force of 100 infantry and 100 cavalry to move on any required point, within a few months, it may be confidently assumed that this small force of 800 infantry and 170 cavalry will have completely pacified the small district, and the scandal of a people in the very centre of Persia refusing to acknowledge the authority of the Shah will be done away with.The Bakhtlaris smile at the state of affairs in Lur-i-Kuchak, and the Ilkhani. if allowed, would soon reduce it to order. It is very doubtful, however, whether this anarchy is not connived at for political reasons. To open the Karun to navigation, and the roads through Luristan to commerce, is, to the mind of the bhah, to give the foreigner a footing in Shustar and Dizful, to enrich the Lurs and Arabs, and to strengthen a part of the country still unsubdued and occupied by alien races and but scantily by Persians. FELLAHlAH.—See Dorak. FlRttZABAD—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Fars, 72 miles south of Shiraz, and lOo miles from Bu- shahr by Farrashband. . Though prosperous it is now less important than it was m the middle ages, and now contains some 4,000 inhabitants. It is sur rounded by a mud wall and ditch, and there are a few plantations of date trees round it. The town, though walled, is incapable of offering any resistance to an army, and it is commanded by a low range ot lulls on the east side. Supplies of grain and slaughter cattle can be procured here, and rice, fuel, and ghi can be obtained from the nomads in the Firuzabad is the chief town of the Ilkhani, who should be chief of the Iliyat tribes of the district, but having been left early an orphan with no one to look after his interests, the headship of the clan passed to his first cousin Darab Khan, who seems to be a kind of brigand on a magnificent scale. The Ilkhani is an educated and refined man of more than average intelligence. &lt; # n The plain to which Firuzabad gives its name is elevated and well watered and bears rich wheat and famous rice. It is one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia. For the most part it is 7 miles wide, but at the south-eastern extiem- ity narrows to 5 miles. Here it only produces grass, and has a rocky mountain ridge on either hand, that on the north-east rising to 2,000 feet. It had thirty villages as many years ago, but the number is now reduced to thirteen. The Firuzabad river, which has its source in the Dasht-i-Muak, enters and leaves the plain by great gorges in the moun tains which bound it. It is full of fish. Before arriving at Babu Nej it forces its way through three more of these gorges, the last of which has perpendicular cliffs 500 feet high; it then joins its waters with those of the Kara Agach and flows into the Mund river (q.v.) This district enjoys a moderate climate and was recommended by Colonel Taylor as being in every way eligible for a cantonment. The terms on which land is held in this district are as follow :—Land the private property of the farmer is cultivated at his sole expense, the labourers receiving in lieu of wages one-fifth of the produce ; out of the remainder the farmer accounts to government for one-third as tax. When the labourer furnishes seed, plough, and labour, he receives one-third, government one-third, and the land-owner one-third of the produce. On the Crown lands the government takes two parts of the produce, but furnishes seed and ploughs: the labourer gets the UZ243 16 a 243 FIR—GAH D-lvin^n o ^ h ® u tlie iand belongs to the peasant,* he cultivates it, giving one part of the produce to government and keeping two parts for himsdf Beyond Firuzabad on the road to Shiraz is the Tang-i-Flruza- bad, a defile where the road goes along the bed of a stream which has to be crossed frequently. _ The bounding heights, however, are not very piecipitous, and could easily be crowned by infantry. There is a road from Bushahr by this place to Shiraz known as the Firuzabad road, which is piacticable for field artillery and caravans. the north-west of Firuzabad are some ruins known as Old Firuzabad, or Kala Firuzabad, evidently once a considerable town, its ditch and embankment (the former 40 or 50 paces wide), orming a wide circle, nearly a mile in diameter. Inside are the ruins of stone-built houses and in the centre a solid stone pillar, 12 feet square, and 60 feet high. There are also the remains of two tanks and a great temple of the Ghabrs. The latter stands close by the mouth of the northern gorge. It is built, like the town, of unhewn stone, and its walls are 10 feet thick. It is about 120 yards long and 60 wide. Old Firuzabad would seem to have been built by Ardashir Baba Khan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, on the site of an older town, Gur. In the 10th century it was taken by Azad-ud-Daulah of the Buidh dynasty, and he gave it the name Firuzabad. With regard to the modern town legend says that Alexander the Great built a dam at the gorge at the southern end, thus flooding the plain and destroying Old Firuzabad. In a later generation Firuz Shah broke the dam, drained the plain, and founded the modern town, called after his own name.

GAMASIAB or GAMSU—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Persia, formed by the junction of three streams, all of which spring from the east of Karmanshah. The first, and most in considerable, has its commencement about 25 miles west of Hamadan. The second has three springs on the side of Mount Elvand, 6 or 8 miles south of that place. The latter runs south-west till it meets the former on the plain of Maran, about 10 miles south-west of Kan- gawar, and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place, it is joined by the third, or chief, branch of the Karkhah, which comes from the Guran mountains by a north-west course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams under the above name then winds for nearly 30 miles in a general west direction to Bisatun, where it is crossed by a good brick bridge, chiefly along the Guran moun tains. At this celebrated spot the Gamasiab receives the Ab-i-Dinawar coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream, called the Karasu, passing through Karmanshah at about 20 miles north-north-west of that place. Erom this it is called the Karasu. Schindler says the Kalan and Nahawand streams together form the Gamasiab. Plowden says the Gamasiab and Karasu join 15 miles from Karmanshah.

A low pass in Pars north-east of Shiraz, crossed on the way to Zargun. The road is very stony, but the gradient easy. (MacGregor.) GARDAN-I-ALAKABUT—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ardalan, 1-|- miles south of Bijar, on the road to Karmanshah. It is reached by a rough, narrow, and tortuous path, 550 feet of ascent, enclosing heights 100 to 200 feet high, steep and rocky, but accessible, whence a sharp descent of 500 feet to plains takes place. But the whole length is so short, and the gradients so easy, that a road might be made without great cost. (Nagner.) The caravan route from the town of Bijar lies through a narrow defile known as the Tang-i-Khalija, and up a rough glen to the south ern slopes of the plateau. The road is tortuous, and the rock, which crops out freely, a hard limestone. The total ascents and descents from the town to the south slope of the plateau are 600 feet and 500 feet respectively. The pass may be turned by a long detour, 12 to 15 miles by the villages of Kara-bualh and Mokalla. The artillery of the Shah's escort have come horsed to Bijar by this route. (Napier.) GARDAN-I-ALIABAD—Lat. Long. Elev. 8,900'. A pass in Yazd, south-west of the village of 'Aliabad, between Dih-i shir and Taft. The pass divides the Pusht-Kuhand Pish-kuh subdivisions.

It is rugged and steep, and commanded by heights difficult of access, but might, with no great amount of labour, be made passable for guns. It may also be turned, by a detour of about 20 miles, by another pass to the west of Kuh Panjah. It marks the boundary between Karmanshah and Kurdistan pro vinces of Irak-i-Ajami, on the road between Tabriz and Karmanshah. The ascent is by a steep and narrow path between steep and barely accessible slopes of 500 to 1,000 feet, crowned by granite peaks; total ascent, 1,000 feet. The descent is over steep slopes, 400 feet in | mile; path barely practicable for wheels, but improvable without seri ous difficulty. {Napier.) GARDAN-I-GOSHTI—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears, 131 miles north-west of Shiraz. The ascent from the north is easy, though stony, while the descent towards Dihbid is also gradual over 7 miles. {MacGregor.) G ARE AN-I-KHU SHAMAN AH—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Persian Kurdistan, on the Sihna-Sulimania road about 21 farsakhs (9 miles) beyond Dawaiza. Both ascent and descent are steep, the latter, {i.e., the Sulimania side) being the worst. {T. C. Plowden.) GAREAN-I-MULAWAS (?)—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass, distant about 44 miles from Karmanshah, on the road to Tabriz. Ascent of this pass from the Tabriz side is about 300 feet, descent on the other about 900; the path is obstructed by boulders, tortuous and narrow, but with practicable gradients and easily improvable. {Napier.) GAREAN.I-RAZAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Luristan, about 22 miles south of Burujird, on the road to Khuramabad. There is a fine view from the summit. Kilangani and Razan are villages on either side. {Schindler.) It leads across a range of hills that here bounds the Eizful river to the south. The ascent is steep, in places £ to feet. Barometer top of pass 23' 45' (6,930 feet), 22nd April.- At first the descent skirting the hill-side on the north is stony, shortly improving in gradient to -g- to ^-q, the hill-side becoming clayey and gravelly. Eifficult stretches of rock frequent, cherty in appearance, with veins of quartz and fels par : clay, tenacious and of a white colour. Average width of path 10 feet: over rock, a narrow 2 feet track. {Bell, 1884.) GAREAN-I-SHlR—Lat. Long. Elev. 8,800'. A ridge, or col, in the Kuh-i-Siah, Ears, the watershed between the country to east and Pa din ah district to west. Forests of oak all about this neighbourhood, forming, as regards their acorns, a considerable part of the food of the population, if not the whole of it, in winter. The247 GAR—GAR failure of these acorn crops, combined with those of corn caused the great famine of 1871. (Durand.) GAREH on GARTH—Lat. Long. Elev. 14,000'. A mountain in Khuzistan, south-west of the Ardal plateau. It forms a mighty mass; between it and the Zardah lies the lofty Kuh-i-Dinar. The Karun escapes from the Ardal valley between the Kuh-i-Sabz and Kuh-i-Arman, through the Dupulan gorge. ( Wells) Many offshoots and spurs from tins mountain range are crossed on the Isfahan-Shustar road between Ardal and Shalll, and increase the difficulties of that road. AAells says the marches over this portion were very trying : the up and down hill work on the south side of the Arman-Gareh saddle was terrible, though this may be avoided by making a detour through the valley. GARMAB—Lat. Long. Elev. One of the eight villages of which the district of Biabanak, to the north of Yazd, is composed. It is situated 5 farsakhs north of Baiazah. [Mac Gregor) GARMlLl—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,500 , . A small village on the slopes of the Gair range, Ears, near the Kam-Firuz plain, and about 20 miles from Duzd (Diz)-i-Kurd. The slopes are covered with oak trees. The head of the village pays three- fourths the produce to the Il-begi of the Kashkais, who does not supply seed. There is no poll-tax or tax on animals, owing to the village not being regularly settled. This place must have been of importance formerly, to judge by the tomb stones. (Durand) GARMSlR— The term which is applied to the road which leads from Bandar Abbas by Eorghan, (?) Tarum, Eurg, and Darab to Shiraz. It is said to be much infested by an insect called “Sinn,” and there is very little forage or provisions on it. [Abbott) Stack says it is :— “ a term applied by the Persians to all warm regions, particularly those that are also deserts, or on the borders of deserts. Certain offenders against the laws are transported to the Garmsir in particular between the Shiraz mountains and the Persian Gulf.” Bell writes (1884)— “ Inland from the low sandy shore of the Persian Gulf, extends to the low hills of sandstone and conglomerate a vast level of variable width (average 35 miles), a barren mud flat for some miles, liable to be flooded by high tides and heavy rains, and beyond a plain growing cereals of various kinds, melons, &amp;c.; it is sparsely populated, _ its few villages being planted at considerable intervals apart; water is found 10 feet from the surface; it is of good quality, except for some miles to the east of the Karun. Wells are numerous in and round about the villages not situated on streams. It is poorly irrigated. A few trees, chiefly the date-palm, grow round about the villages only ; firewood is scarce. Each village community owns from 50 to 60 donkeys, 300 to 500 sheep, and 5 or 6 cows.« The climate of this plain may be assumed not to vary to any appre ciable extent from that of Bushahr. “ Its summer heat is tempered by no rain, and it well deserves the name of Garmsxr, given to it by the Persians. The pasturage during the hot months of the year is burnt up, scant, and of a poor quality ; the chief food of all cattle consists of chopped straw and barley, both plentiful. “The only supplies procurable from the villages in limited quantities are fowls, sheep, milk, eggs, butter, raughan (ghi), barley, corn, and chopped straw. “In general terms “Harm sir” applies in South-West Persia to the low lands or parts inhabited with comfort during the winter, as opposed to “ Sardsir,” the highlands or summer quarters of the Iliyats. GAS AIR KHOR—Lat. 29° IP 20'. Long. 50 o 40' 50'. Elev. A river of Ears, which flows into the Persian Gulf a few miles north of Bushahr.

A river running into the Tigris, crossed by the caravan route from labriz to Karmanshah, 14 miles beyond Girdakanu (q. v.). The Gawa-rud valley lies in the Sungar district of Ardalan. {Napier.) It is a small stream crossed between Sungar and Besitun, on the Tabiiz-Karmanshah road, at 21^ miles from the former; descent to it ' 248249 GER-GHA 300 feet; stream small; fordable except in flood; bottom sound j banks low; then ascend 425 feet. {Napier, 1876.) GERtJS—Lat. Long. Elev. The district of Gems, one of the hereditary chiefships of Western Persia, covers a large area between the districts of Khamsah and Kur distan, and the provinces of Azarbaijan and Karmanshah. The surface is broken by the drainage of the Kizil Uzan into a number of wide level plateaux, culminating at one central point in rocky elevations, and round the edges falling abruptly into a labyrinth of ravines to the drainage level. The valleys and glens are well watered and fertile, but their area bears a very small proportion to the whole. The extensive plateaux are almost destitute of vegetation, and barren to all appearance, but have an excellent soil, and with season able rains bear large crops of wheat and barley. As much as fifteen-fold is commonly stated to be yielded under favourable conditions. The rocky elevations and the unploughed por tions of the plateaux afford pasturage, seemingly poor in quality, but of unlimited extent. Various computations place the number of villages at about 500, with an average of thirty houses each. For the most part they are small, there being but two, Khasrabad and Najafabad, of over a hun dred houses. These have about 300 each, and Bijar 1,500. Hence the popula tion may be roughly estimated at 80,000 to 85,000 souls. Kurds, Turks, and Persians, that is clans speaking Persian, but of obscure origin, are found in about equal proportions. To the south and west the Kurdish element predominates, to the north the Turkish. The revenue of the district, estimated at about 12,000 tumans = £4,800, is assigned to the chief, who furnishes to the Shahi army one regiment of 800 men and 850 artillerymen, for the most part in the Turkish villages. Morier speaks of Gerustan as a district 5 days^ journey south of Miana, in which district the Kizil Uzan rises. {Napier.) GHABR or GHEBAR— The name of a large religious sect, which has still many followers in Persia. They are so well known under the name of Parsis in India that it is unnecessary to describe them here. It may be mentioned that the Ghabrs, or fire-worshippers, of Yazd deal chiefly in opium. They have a stone tower and platforms, where they expose their dead. Chan and Mubarik villages, about 8| miles from Yazd, are inhabited by Ghabrs. ■’AHabad near Taft, also, is one of their chief villages, and they own 200 out of its 1,000 houses. {MacGregor — StacJc.)

The climate is superior to the plain country, but inferior to that of the plains beyond the Kotal-i-Pir-zan and Shiraz. The road to it is precipitous and boulder-strewn. A force camping at Glsakhan would have to bring all its supplies from the sea-board. Firewood, however, can be collected from brushwood and scrubby trees, which are more or less sparsely sprinked over the hills. [Belly — Colville—Persian Gulf Pilot.) GISHKUH—Lat. Long. Elev.

The river here was deep, and flowing, say, 5 miles an hour, and at this season it is 40 yards in width. Its banks showed marks of a rise of 10 or 12 feet during spring floods, when the width would be 60 yards. Our horses and baggage had to be unloaded, and their saddles taken off and then swum across. Donkeys and sheep are swum over in pairs by a man with the aid of a masak. The situation of God-i-Balutak is admir-■ 253 GOH—GRU ably adapted for a flying-bridge.

It wanders slowly between mud banks, 18 feet high. It has a taste of naphtha, and is the same brackish water that is found in the marsh, which, in fact, is fed by it. On the banks of the stream are the Bawizah tribe's summer grounds. There are signs of cultivation and jars of unburnt clay made for the purpose of holding grain. The Gopal in December shows marks of flood, 6 feet higher than its then normal level. It was 30 feet broad and 3 feet deep in that month. The water is rendered bitter by the sulphated lime which impregnates the soil gypsum. {Baring — Wells) GORAFSHAT—Lat. Long. Eley.

The spring floods give a rise of 11 feet. The situa tion of Gudar Balutak is admirably adapted for a flying bridge, and there is nothing to prevent the working of such a bridge if a good stout one was built for the purpose. Laden mules could then make the passage in a few minutes. {Baring — Schindler — Mackenzie— Wells.) See also G5 d-I-Balutak. GUDAR-I-NAL SHIKAN—Lat. Long. Elev.

It contains 150 houses and pays 500 tumans revenue. The tract lying along the coast between Bandar Dilam and Bandar Rig is called Gunawa. It is composed of a confused mass of low, grotesquely-shaped sandstone and earthy hills, in parts intersected with vertical lines of gypsum crop ping up. This tract was evidently formerly thickly populated, there being many ruins upon it. It is supposed to have fallen into a desert state from the river, which formerly ran through it, having dried up. Though this place is much decayed, the Shaikh, who is dependent on the governor of Bushahr, can bring 1,200 horsemen into the field. There is a considerable trade with other ports in horses and grain from this place. {Layard — Felly — Bruchs — Monteith.) The village is inhabited chiefly by cultivators, and little is to be procured except fowls (which are very fine), cattle, and vegetables. There is a large tomb, with a dome, at the north end of the village. Eastward of the village are very extensive mounds, indicating the site of a city. One or two wells, smoothly lined with cement, have re cently been uncovered by accident. {Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot) Lat. of large banyan tree on beach, 29° 34' 38'; long. 50° 30' 38'.

During the winter months, and in summer and autumn they encamp on the Ab-i- Gargar from Shustar to the junction of that canal with the main body of the river Karun at Band-i-Kir, and also the plain of Mosi Bena. The Gunduzlu is the only one of the Afshars who returned to their own country after being transported thence to the north of Persia. Many Arab families have joined this tribe, and while the Turkish language is still understood by them, both Arabic and Persian are generally spoken. [Layard.) They consist of 1,500 families. They have among them a consider able number of expert horsemen, and were in the time of Muhammad TakI very useful in encounters with the Arabs, to whom .they are superior in gallantry. {Bell.) GUR—Lat. Long. Elev. The ancient name of Firuzabad {q.v.), also Ardashlr Khuvrih. It was one of the principal towns of the Sassanians. Istakhrih speaks of it as follows : — a Gur is one of the foundations of Ardashir, hence the name Gur, or “ foundation.^ It is reported that the place where it stands was filled with stagnant water, and resembled a lake, and that Ardashir made a vow to build a town on the spot where he should conquer his enemies, and to construct on it a fire-temple, and he was victorious at Gur. He contrived to remove the water of the place by making an opening for the water to flow away; and he built on that spot Gur.” (For further description see Durand.) 257 17258 GUR-GUR In short, the town would seem to have been built by Ardaslnr Baba Khan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, on the site of an older town, Gur, and he then changed the name to Ardashir Khuvrih, or “ the glory of Ardashir.” In the 10th century it was taken by Azad-ud- Daulat, who was of the Dilemite dynasty, which held the mastery in Fars in the 10th and part of the 11th centuries. The name then became Flruzabad at the dictates of its new master. {Durand.) GURAK—Lat. _ Long. _ Elev. A village in Fars, 12 miles from Bushahr on the Flruzabad road.

(Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot — Bracks.) GtiTRAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Karmanshah. In 1834, when British officers were attached to the Persian army. Major Rawlinson was appointed to raise a regiment of Guran Kurds, which he succeeded in doing. The Kurds, from which this regiment was formed, are a frank and hospitable race, and, like most mountaineers, are hard and enduring; very little is known of their faith, which appears to embody the various doctrines of Judaism, Christianity, and Shiah Muhammadanism. They are termed ’All-Uahls, and are supposed by Major Rawlinson to be of Jewish origin. Regarding this tribe, Mr. T. C. Plowden (1881) says : “ The Gurans have frequently threatened to transfer their allegiance to Turkey, and but for their disinclination to quit the sacred vicinity of Zardah (the holy place of the AH-llahl sect), they would, in their impatience of control, probably have emigrated ere this to Sullmanla. They are a branch of the Kalhur. Their present teritory extends from the plain of Mahldasht to Harun Nishln Khan near Banah. Kala Zanjlr and Mount Dalahu are included in it. The territory of the tribe is separated from that of Turkey by the Upper Diala. The present chief is Husain Khan, son of Asad-Ullah Khan, who is both Sartlp and Hakim (vide Kalhur) and resides at Gahwara, south of Karlnd. His regiment of infantry is considered to be the best in the province of Karmanshah. It is divided into eight companies, each 100 strong,259 17 a GUR—GUR with a Sultan or Sadbashi (Yuzbashi?) at the head of each. They are, however, only armed with muzzle-loading' fire-arms of German make, furnished by the Persian Government. Husain Khan possesses some Martini rifles, his own property, which he has distributed to a few picked men. In addition, he maintains a small personal retinue ©f horse, but they are not kept up for the service of the State. The Sharafbainee Jafs of Bama are under Husain Khan's authority. All the land held by the Gurans is “ Milkiat,” cultivated under the same system as that of the &lt;c Kalhur They are estimated at 2,000 families.' ( Rawlinson — Plowden.) Of this tribe Sir Henry Rawlinson writes as follows :—“ Shortly after the time of Sultan Murad, the Kalhur tribe, which had been driven out from Dartung and Darnah, assumed to themselves the pecu liar designation of &lt;f Gurans,' which had been previously applied to the Kurdish peasantry as distinguished from the clans : and these Gurans at the same time broke off into three distinct tribes of Killah Zanjiri, Kirriudi, and Bewanlji, the names being derived from their several places of residence. They are said, with the connivance of the Government of Karmanshah, to have driven the Bajilans out of Dar nah in about the year 1700, and to have obliged the latter to confine themselves to the plains, in which, shortly afterwards, the Bajilan Pasha founded the town of Zohab.'

A peak in Ears, Persia, the south spurs of which run down for about 30 miles to the coast of the Persian Gulf, a few miles east of Bushahr, and form an extensive bay with fair anchorage. The mountain of Halila is situated 30 miles in the interior, on a sandy plain, and close to the range of hills that run parallel with the coasts. Its great height makes it appear much closer than it really is; it is about 5,000 to 6,000 feet high, and may be seen distinctly on a clear day at a distance of 60 miles. Snow can be obtained from it nearly all the year round; the natives bring it down on the backs of camels or mules wrapped in blankets, and dispose of it to the richer inhabitants. The proper name of the peak is Kuh-i-Bahrami, and it is also known as 4he Kuh-i-Khormuj, from Khormuj, a town of the Dashti tribe. The villao-e of Halila has a square fort, and is situated about two-thirds of a mile from Ras Halila, which is in latitude 28° 50' SO', longitude 50° 54'.

Some few scattered villages are to be seen in this bay, and the signs of cultivation may be perceived here and there. The anchorage is not very good, and vessels are obliged to lie some distance off shore on account of the shallowness of the water. There is, however, good shelter from noE-westers. The best anchorage is with Halila point south 79° east true, and Ras Halila north 31° 21' true, in 3£ or 4 fathoms at low water: soft, muddy bottom. The authority of the Shaikh of Bushahr ends here and the Tangistan district commences. (Kemp thorn c — B rucks — Morier — Belly!) Latitude of square tower in village 28° 49' 51*. Long. 50° 53' 5 .

A town in Khuzistan, on the right bank of the river Karkhah, 65 miles south-west of Shustar, and 60 miles north of Basra. It is the chief place of the Wall of Arabistan, whose sway formerly extend ed to all the Arabs in this country. It was formerly a well populat ed place, but since the river deserted it, most of the inhabitants have left, and there are now, perhaps, not more than 500 houses in the place. The inhabitants are chiefly Arabs. It is situated in a district suffi ciently fertile to supply four-fifths of the corn used in the markets of Basra. A canal, called the Shatt-ul-Kkud, connects the Karkhah river with the Tigris, by which a boat may pass from the latter to the former in five or six hours. The district of Hawizah is a remnant of an independent Arab princi pality which was powerful in its day, and its chief, or governor, is still always a member of the old ruling family, i.e., the Mulla of Hawizah. It is necessary in practice that the governor of this district should be acceptable to both Prince and people, for the Shaikhs of the tribes would not pay tribute to a chief who has been placed over them in opposition to their wishes. It sometimes happens that the people insist on having as governor a chief to whom the Persian government objects. The Arabs then become what is termed ‘ asi/ or rebellious, decline to pay tribute, and, if pressed, retire to the marshes. A com promise ensues, and the government generally consents to nominate the popular candidate in consideration of an increased “ plshkash,” i.e. the part of the revenue that the prince-governor takes for himself. The marshes of Hawizah afford handy refuge to the discontented, and the ease with which the Arabs can retire to them is a wholesome cheek on Persian rapacity. Rice is largely cultivated in these marshes. The estimated population of this district in 1879 was 33,000 and the revenue 21,000 tumans, of which 14,000 were “diwan,” i.e. } that which goes to Tihran and 7,000 were “ pishkash.” The revenue was to be raised to 30,000 tumans. In this district many of the tribes are Muutafik, which have crossedHIM—HOB HIMMATlBAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

A town in Khuzistan, on the Tab river (q.v.), 35 miles from its mouth. The town is in ruins. It might at one time have held from 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, but at present there are not more than 400 or 500. It is situated on both sides of the river—that on the right hank belonging to the Shaikh of the K J ab Arabs, while that on the left is under the governor of Bihbahan. The river is here about 100 yards wide, with banks 15 feet or 18 feet high. It can be forded 9 miles above the town, and is navigable for boats of 20-tons burden. Its breadth is 80 yards in February and unfordable at the town, where its water is scarcely drinkable, being tainted in passing through the low hills south of Zaitun. (Bell.) The river is navigable for boats of small burthen from the sea to this place, and “ buggalows ” come here from Kowait and Bushahr. Ophthalmia is said to be the prevailing disease at this place. Colonel Felly gives the following information of the trade of Hindiah:— “The imports are about 1,000 ‘ karahs 3 of dates from Basra, each karah paying five kirans duty, and piece-goods to the value of 20,000 kirans. “ The exports are mainly gram, to the value of about 200,000 kirans, coming down from Bihbahan and Hurmuz, and paying a duty of half kiran per Hashim maundj 100,000 kirans worth of wool from the upper country, 10,000 kirans of roghan, and some 10,000 sheep paying half kiran each, duty.

Their wealth consists prin cipally in cattle, which yields them a considerable revenue, and which they prefer to that produced by the cultivation of the soil. They breed camels and horses for sale, and their sheep yield milk, which is made into roghan (liquid butter) and sold throughout the country. The peculiar privileges of the Iliyats consist in liberty to range over districts from which no one can dispossess them. They ascend in the summer to cold regions called Xlaks, where they find pasture, and in the winter keep to their Kishlak tracts, which enjoy a warmer climate. These Xlaks and Kishlaks are defined to each tribe by the Government, and whenever their limits are encroached upon by unprivileged tribes, violent strifes and battles ensue. “ The existence of these migratory tribes being advantageous to the Government, they are little oppressed. They are taxed at certain established rates upon each head of cattle, and are called upon to serve in the king’s armies. They pay at the rate of five piastres for each camel, one piastre for each cow, the same for mares, one abbasi, or quarter-piastre, for a sheep. When they cultivate the ground, they are fined according to the rates exacted from the other Rayahs. Should they not be cultivators, each ten khanahs, or houses, provide one horse man, mounted and armed; and each five, one footman, or tufankchi. These receive forage from the Shah. The horseman’s pay is about eight tumans annually, for which he serves six months in the field; the other six he remains at home. He is paid twice in the year, half and half in advance, and during the time he is in actual service receives a daily allowance of one man of barley for his horse, and straw in proportion. The horsemen are obliged to attend the muster and the review, which the king makes after the Nau-Ruz of all his troops, properly mounted and equipped, or they are severely punish ed. The tufankchi, or foot soldier, gets 7 tumans per annum, and half the year remains at home. The wages, are paid into the hands of the Khan of the tribe, who then delivers over the money to the subaltern officers, called Sultans and Bin-bashis, who pay the soldiers. This promotes peculation; the Khan, subteicting his share, the Mirza or scribe his, and the subalterns theirs, while the poor soldier deems himself very lucky if he gets one-half of that which is his due. Agha Muhammad Shah, the eunuch king, used to pay the troops with his own hand. The great advantage of being military servants is protection to their families, the Governors of villages and other men in office not daring to molest them under such circum stances. “ The Iliyats are not compelled to bestow their labour upon publicworks like the other Rayahs; they keep exclusively to their tents and tend their cattle. The taxes they pay are levied by their chiefs, who account with the Government. Those who are inclined to elude tax ation frequently do so by secreting their cattle in the mountains. “ In their different small communities, they are governed by Rlsh- safids (literally “ white-beards”) or elders, who have no other emblem of power or superiority to show than a white beard. Old age is extreme ly respected by them, and generally by all Persians, and is indulged with great liberties. A Rlsh-safi'd, a poor miserable old man, will not fail whenever his tribe is oppressed, to make a journey purposely to remonstrate with the governor of the province, and abuse him to his face; and so careful are the Governors not to offend these influential persons that they bear their reproof with moderation, and are fain to be civil. Their disputes are decided by their Rlsh-safids; even the ordinances of their hakims, or governors, are referred to them. In all cases of marriage the elder is first consulted, and bis consent procured as a preliminary. The tribes seldom intermarry. The elders recom mend families whose daughters may be selected for wives; but, when ever one tribe refuses to give their daughters in marriage to another, it is esteemed an affront and a motive for strife. “ The Persian Government is ever jealous of the migration of these tribes, and they cannot remove from one province to another without first having obtained the Shah's permission. In times of trouble, such as the death of the king, frequently, if they be strong enough to encounter opposition, they pass from their old haunts to better places. “We have said before that the possessions of the Iliyats consist of cattle. These are camels, horses, mares, cows, oxen, mules, asses, sheep, and goats, besides a fine race of dogs. Their pastures, although open to the Shah, the princes, and the other great men of the country, may also be said to be their property, inasmuch as they have liberty • to range over them, unless there has been issued a f kuruk/ or pro hibition. “ From the pastures which are appropriated to the use of the Shah and the princes, such as Sultaniah, tJjan, &amp;c., they are totally exclud ed, unless they receive permission, for which they pay a certain quan tity of the produce of their flocks. For instance, in 1815 the Shah did not go to Sultaniah, and he allowed the Illyats to feed their cattle there, provided they furnished him with 1,000 mans of roghan, or preserved butter. “ Their property, if it may be so called, consists of tents, carpets, bedding, cooking utensils, large cauldrons in which they boil the roghan, or preserved butter, skins to shake the butter and sour milk in, and all the rude furniture of shepherds. Much of their furniture consists of camel pack-saddles, ornamented bridles for the chief camel, besides other ornaments in beads, &amp;c. Among the Kurdish tribes the women ride in ( kajawahs/ which are cage-like panniers placed on each side of the camel, each large enough to contain a woman. Then there are saddles for horses and ‘ palans 3 for mules, and a sort of padded cushion for the back of their tents. “ An IHyat of middling fortune possesses about a hundred sheep, 273 13274 I LI—I LI three or four camels, three or four mares, ten asses, &amp;c., which may yield him a revenue of 40 to 50 tumans. A man who possesses a thousand sheep, thirty camels, twenty mares, &amp;c., is reckoned a rich man. Each sheep may be valued at 2 piastres, a camel at 10, a mare at 8, and an ass at &amp;, Such a property would yield a revenue of 400 tumans. This is derived from the wool and milk of sheep, the wool and hire of the camels, the colts from the mares and asses ; the female camel brings forth once every two years, the mare every year, and the sheep once a year. In some parts of Persia,particularly among the Kurds, who enjoy the finest pasturage, the ewes produce twice a year. There are a few rich Persians, whose possessions and modes of life assimilate to those of the patriarchs of old. Such was Isa Khan, of Turbat, who was calculated to possess 160,000 sheep, 20,000 camels, 6,000 mares, and other cattle in proportion. Ahmad Khan, of Maiaghah, was also an immensely rich farmer. The Wall of Sihna, and several others, might also be classed among those leading patriarchal lives. “ The patrimony of an Iliyat is divided among his children, accord ing to the Mussalman law: two-thirds to the sons, and one-third to the daughters, the latter taking the clothes and valuables belonging to the mother. “The value of an Iliyat tent is about 6 to 7 tumans. It is made of goats* hair, consisting of cloths about a foot and a quarter in width, woven by the women. All the members of a family—men, women, and children—are usually employed spinning goats* hair, which is either in actual use in the loom or laid by for sale. “ They weave the cloth in a portable loom, which they fix in the rudest manner possible, but which answers all the purposes for which it is intended. This cloth is of strong texture, impervious to rain, and will last twenty years. The covering of one of the tents is gener ally about 40 feet in length and 20 in breadth, and is erected upon a range of poles, the back and sides being fitted up with reeds, made into walls, and is fastened to the ground with pegs. The tents are extremely rude, and do not show any appearance of attention to comfort. In Azarbaijan, and the more northern and consequently rainy countries, they have another sort of tent which has been borrowed from the Turkmans. This consists of ribs united, and, when open, is like a cage on which thick felts are thrown, and it is entered by a narrow door : it is called “ alajeh ;** the goats* hair tents are called ‘ kara chadar,* or black tent. “ The encampments of the Illyats are generally of about twenty to thirty tents together, which they pitch mostly without any great at tention to regularity. They are also to be seen in a circle, as well as in line, and appear conspicuous on a light soil owing to their black colour; on a dark soil they are scarcely perceptible, particularly under the shadow of a mountain. The tents are close to each other, but the different encampments may be a mile or two asunder, according to the convenience of grass and water. “ The Iliyats feed principally on the produce of their flocks, and eat sour milk, cheese, dough or buttermilk, and much roghan or preserved butter. Their annual expenses are much less than those of275 * 18 a ILI—1LI the inhabitants of cities; for, excepting their clothes, copper utensils, pack-saddles, and ornamental luxuries, they supply all their own necessities. Their simple manner of living (not to mention their being out ot the way of extortion) may be calculated at one hundred per cent, cheaper than m the town. They make their own tents or dwelling-places, weave their own carpets and hammocks or felts cut their own wood and burn their own charcoal; they kill their own meat, make their cheese and butter, and their lives are far more free from disease and local complaints. Their dress does not differ from that of other Persians, except in its extreme meanness. A man rich in cattle will appear with a coat to his back that scarcely holds together, and in such indifferent dresses, but with no other coveriuo- over their heads than their tents, their women and children will brave all the ngour of winter. The favourite wife or child enjoys whatever luxury of dress belongs to the tribe, consisting of gold bracelets, neck laces, silver and gold ornaments for the hair; frequently a handker chief is edged with perforated silver coin, and baudeans of the same are tied about the head and neck. It is not uncommon to meet with ancient medals suspended about the neck and heads of the Iliyat women and childern. “ The time of the IliyaPs rest is the winter, when his flocks are not productive and require no other care than being led to pasture. The men then help the women to weave carpets and tent cloths, or spin goats’ hair. At the approach of spring all is then full of activity: the ewes bring forth, then the lambs are tented, then shearing comes on, the flocks require constant milking, and the numerous uses to which the milk is consigned, that is butter, dough, and roghan, re quire much work, which the men perform. The women, too, are very laborious; they pitch and unpitch encampments when on a march, load and unload the beasts of burden, attend the children and the young animals; they sit down in companies to spin, and help to churn and make sour milk. The drudgery is for the women; the business of protection, purchase, and sale, and all the greater interests of the community for the males. “ The Iliyats break up their winter encampments one month after the festival of the Nau-Ruz, i.e., one month after the sun has entered the sign Aries, and travel by easy journeys of 2 to 3 miles each day to what they call the f Sar-hadd/ or the boundary between the cold and hot region; there they stay for about a month, and then travel on again to their Ilak, where they encamp during the heat of summer and where they remain about seventy days; they then return to the ‘ Sar-hadd/ where they remain another month, and at length reach their old haunts in the Kishlak for the winter. Many direct their motions by the rising of the stars, and many by the appearance of the snowy mountains. They are unmolested in their passage, and perhaps may give a sheep or so to the lords of the villages near which they travel. The ground upon which they encamp is improved by their presence, since it is strengthened by the manure they leave. “ Their mode of calculating property is by sheep; they pay their shepherds in sheep. In their own dealings, in their purchase of oxen276 IL1—ILI &amp;e., they pay in sheep. A man killing one of their dogs is liable to be fined 4 sheep. Among the villages, too, in their smaller dealings, the Persian Rayah deals with his neighbour, not in money, but in kind,— corn, wool, straw, &amp;c. Three months after the Nau-Ruz, they separate the rams from the ewes and feed them till they are ‘ must/ At the beginning of the sign Mizan, or Libra, they turn them into the flock, by which the ewes bear at about the Nau Ruz, and some of the Iliyats cele brate this event by music, songs, and merry-making. Shearing takes place twice in the year; the first time after the Nau-Ruz, about the 20th of May; and the second at the Mizan. They give of their wool and other produce of their flocks, which is called by the general name of f kashf, * to the poor in alms. At the time of the new lambs they take portions of their milk, which they make into curds, cream, kalmak and fresh cheese, and send it to their friends as a complimentary gift, marking the return of the season. A shepherd has the care of three hundred sheep, and is paid in kind, both in wool and lambs. “ From what has been said, it is evident that the Iliyats, as raw material for the formation of troops, must be of considerable conse quence to the state of which they are the subjects. They are soldiers by nature, as far as the mere habit of the man goes, but, it must be added, they are difficult of discipline, owing to their clan-like propen sities. Those on the frontier frequently give rise to feuds and war. One of the principal objects of the war carried on by the Persians against Russia was to induce the Illyats of Karabagh, Sheki, &amp;c., to return to their allegiance to the Shah. On the frontiers, both of Turkey and Russia, the same scenes of clandestine migration take place as those described by Herodotus of the Scythian nomads. Cyaxares seemed to be as well aware of their worth as Abbas Mirza was, for he received those who fled with great kindness and showed them much favour. One of the great sources of bickering between the Turks and Persians are the Kurds on the frontier, who migrate from the one state to the other as best suits their humour or interests. Good legislation would, no doubt, soon turn them into peaceable and industrious com munities ; but, as the eastern governments are at present constituted, the vast regions inhabited by these wanderers must continue mere tracts of waste, adapted solely to the uses of armed shepherds and law less freebooters.

The following is a concise and more recent account of the Illyats bv Bell, 1884 J J The IliydU of 8021 th- West Persia. the peoples inhabiting the south-west of Persia are chiefly Iliyats, or nomads, of foreign origin, the residue of the overflowings from both the west and east, of the Saracen conquerors and of the followers of Jangiz Khan and Taimur. They constitute, perhaps, rather more than one-fourth of the inhabitants of Persia, and afe now both Shahr and Dih-Nishlns (settlers in towns and villages) and Sahra-Nishins or Iliyats (nomads); the former are despised by the latter and considered by them to be degenerate and fallers-off from the simplicity and hardi hood of nomad life and reourrers to city protection. This sentiment is but one of envy; the life of the Dihnishins would attract all, did not the counterbalancing fear of exactions and increased taxation serve to force them to a mode of life less under government control. A foreign race, they are prone to rebellion, and if assisted from abroad would Hot submit to Persia. The Sahrd-Nishlns are taxed, kept dispersed, and their chiefs kept as hostages at Tihran ; they are made to contribute to the military power of the State, but are less molested than the Shahr-Nishins ; the limits of their pastures are defined by government. Their flocks are taxed; and if they cultivate the soil, they are taxed as cultivators. A moderate fortune for an Iliy£t consists in the possession-of 100 sheep, 3 or 4 mares, 10 asses, yielding a revenue of from 40 to 50 tumans. A rich Khan will possess ten times the above. They possess a fine race of dogs; sheep constitute their chief wealth. They are good raw material for troops, but difficult to discipline. The Persian irregular cavalry is chiefly recruited from the Iliyats. jj. . Individually they are excellent horsemen, ex- y ‘ pert in the use of carbine, sword, and lance, but they cannot act in unison.278 ILI—ILI Their officers are no better trained in tactical knowledge than the rank and file, and the troops, being commanded by their own local chief, family jealousies prevent a unity of feeling and aim. The cavalry horses (when a force of Iliyats is embodied) are sent out under a small guard to graze whenever possible ; in quarters their food consists of chopped straw and barley ; an average daily ration is 7 lbs. barley and from 14 to 20 lbs. of chopped straw. This is also the ration given by the charwadars to their mules on the line of march. Although the Iliyats furnish to Persia the greater part of her . cavalry, an arm on which she almost wholly relied in past times, yet their infantry has often begn called into the field; the Bakhtiari infantry was renowned as the best in the kingdom. ^ The Iliyats scattered over Persia have been pations, b &amp;c.’ p0wer ' 0CCU ' estimated to number 2,700,000. They are brought up in ignorance of everything except tending their flocks, weaving, and martial exercises. They are taught to despise peaceful occupations. The Shah can call upon them to furnish for service one horseman and two foot soldiers for every ten families, or about 130,000 men if a universal levy were made. The advantage of military service consists in the protection which it affords to the soldier's family; of the pay they see little, as it passes through the hands of the Khan, the Sultan, the Mirza, &amp;c., of the regiment to which the soldier belongs, and each appropriates a share. They are inured to danger and fatigue, and tenacious of the honour of their tribes; hitherto they have been the prop and glory of Persia. They were ubiquitous, and, hovering round about an enemy, never allowed him to rest. Jealousy of their power now causes them to he less drawn upon than formerly for recruits ; many of their number are kept at Tihran as hostages for their loyal behaviour. At best such troops are but lawless and savage marauders and dangerous to a weak government. The cavalry are more highly esteemed than the infantry, simply because every man thinks it degrading to walk and dignified to ride; every Persian is a good horseman, being accustomed to bestride some animal, donkey, mule, or horse from early childhood. Until good legislation shall turn them into peaceable and indus trious communities, the fertile regions over which they wander must be vast pasturages adapted solely to armed shepherds and lawless free booters. It has at times been the policy of the Persian government to split „ . , U P unruly and dangerous tribes and to transport the Iliyats P ° 1Cy cmaus them to distant parts of the empire; thus, the inhabitants of Diz-i-kurd, Dih-i-Kurd, &amp;c., are of Kurdish origin.279 Mr. Schindler considers that the proportion of souls per family among the nomads is smaller than that of residents in towns and villages. Of the Mussulman population 50 - 5 per cent, are females and 49’5 per cent, males. * The Lurs of Lur-i-Kuchak are under the jurisdiction of the G-overnor, resident at Khuramabad. The Lurs of Lur-i-Buzurg are under that of the Governor of Ara- bistan, resident at Burujird and of that of Isfahan. The Kuhgehlu and Mamaseni are under the government of Bih- bahan (Shiraz). The Kashkai are under that of Ears (Shiraz). All are under the Zil-us-Sultan, residing at Isfahan. Of themselves they have no power to combine ; although the chiefs of the Lur families are closely connected together by marriage, where all are equally as faithless, blood relations cannot be trusted. Were combination possible, a weak des- Loyalty potism, such as the Government of Persia is, would be unable to demand more than a fair amount of revenue. Under the guidance of a powerful, trusted, and disinterested agency, capable of suppressing all petty jealousies, alone can combination be looked for to work out a common aim. A foreign power alone amongst Asiatics can play the part of a trusted agency. The most complete account of the Mamaseni and Kuhgehlu Lurs n- -t r n- &amp; au d of the Kashkai, as well as of the other dwellers in Ears, will be found in the works of Dr. Andrea. All these tribes were reduced to order by Prince Farhad Mlrza by a ruthless shedding of blood (since 1877). Besides the policy of scattering all dangerous elements and of in triguing to keep up domestic feuds, already, referred to, the only policy of the Persian rulers is to accumulate wealth during their precarious terms of office; notions of patriotism, of desire for the welfare of the subject, all beliefs in high aims, must be set on one side. The rule resulting from such policy is one of blood and gold. The Uiyat tribes along the border of Turkey and Persia have ever „ , been noted for their predatory habits : the Turk Border Inyats. .. j j i. it • -j-j being regarded by the Persian as an intruder on the limits of the ancient Persian empire; the former, the orthodox believer in Omar and the omnipotent J/tdti the latter, the disciple of the martyred '’All,—the one a Sum, the other a Shiah. The Feill Lurs occupy the Persian border from Dizful to Karman- shah. It is difficult to treat with the border Uiyats diplomatically, they occupying Turkish territory at one time and Persian at another. ( Bell.) IL KHAMSAH—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in Ears, 10 miles west of Persepolis and 20 miles north west of Shiraz. It is celebrated on account of the ancient castle of Istakhar, one of the citadels of Persepolis. The rock on which the castle is placed arises abruptly to a height of 500 feet above a steep conical hill of some 1,200 feet in height, and is visible from a great distance. It is one of the three hills called “ Sih Gumbazan,” or Three domes/” The avenues to the summit are so difficult that the villagers assert that goats were the only four-footed beasts that could climb them, but Morier thinks asses and mules could get up. The rock at its summit exhibits nothing but a few scanty shrubs and one large fir tree placed at its south extremity near the largest of the remains of four reservoirs. {Kinneir — Morier.) A tower which once stood within this rock fortress is said to have once contained Darius' library of sacred books, which were removed by Alexander the Great. Istakhar is said to have been the true capital of the Sassanians ; and many learned men have believed that it was itself the ancient city of Persepolis. The castle was used as late as 1501 as a state prison. (Ussher — Durand!) ISTIHBANAT—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Ears, situated 12 miles from the south-east corner of the lake of Nlrls. The district of Istihbanat extends from the south border of the lake some miles beyond the mountains to the south.

Walnut and sycamore trees flourish in this part, and there is one of the latter of remarkable height and girth, being 45 feet in circumference and 2 feet from the ground. The district possesses eight villages. Its climate is remarkably healthy in winter, as is that of all the circumference of the lake. The porcupine is found here. This district, together with those of Nalrlz and Baonat, are in charge of Mlrza Husain Khan, son of the Sahib-i-Dlwan. (Abbott — Boss.) IWAZ—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village, 17 miles west of Yazd. It is gradually undergoing the change which other villages of this plain have experienced from sand drifts. On its south side the gardens and houses have been buried283 for the space of above 100 yards in breadth, and to the height of 15 to 20 feet in a sand of the finest grain. It is now thirty years since the village has been exposed to this calamity, which by degrees is driving the inhabitants in the opposite direction to the drift. [Abbott) IZZABAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

[Wray) JADDAH-I-ATABEG—Lat. Long. Elev. Name of a road in Kurdistan from Malamir, near Shustar, to Kumi- shah, on the Shiraz-Isfahan road. The following list of stages upon it was furnished to Baron DeBode by a Bakhtiari chief, who stated that the Governor of Isfahan had brought two six-pounder field guns along it:— Mal-amir to Cbapar-dih or Kala-i-Madrasah. Dih-i-Diz—Ravar—Hilisat (?)—Arman. Lurdigun—Falat—Semiran—Kari or Kumishali. This road is closed in winter, being mostly through mountains. [DeBode) The following notes regarding this ancient route are extracted from Bell's South-West Persia, 1884 :— “ The importance of the ruins along the course of the Karun in the mountains indicate that a once practicable caravan road existed between Shustar and Isfahan. Lurdigan is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient capital of the Bakhtiari mountains. The most important of these, however, are those of Susan, a small valley surrounded by lofty and precipitous hills. The river Karun enters and leaves itbydiflScult and deep gorges. The right bank of the river as it enters the valley from the north-east is strewn with ruins known by the Lurs as the Mal-i-Wairan (wealth in ruins), who preserve a tradition as to the284 ♦ JAF—JAG existence of a large and celebrated city in this place. They are prob ably of the Sassanian epoch. Below them the valley narrows, and paved roads of great antiquity are carried along each bank. Still descending the river, the valley again widens, and artificial mounds and ruins again occur; and on the right bank is the tomb of Daniel, held in much veneration by the Lurs (a mean mud hut). Beyond these the river is again confined between tremendous precipices. A paved road,* Very slippery and bad going for horses, is carried along its banks, and ruins of roughly hewn stone, called by the Lurs, Masjid-i-SuKman, occur. Below these are the ruins of a very fine bridge (the bridge of Jirzad), the arches of which must have spanned the river at an eleva tion of 100 feet. The kiln-burnt bricks of which it was constructed resemble those found in ruins of the Kayanian era.” A paved high road was once carried through the plain. A caravan- Pavedroad, Shustar-Is- sarai in ruins exists at the western extremity of fahan. Mai Amir. The next station, for the stations between Shustar and the eastern side of the great chain can still be traced, is at the foot of the mountains near Burs, where there are the ruins of a large caravansarai. The Lurs attribute this road to the Atabegs ; it is evidently a very ancient work. Traces of this old Atabeg road are numerous. Leaving Shustar it traversed the Lawari valley and by Pul-i-burida, Manjinnik (Bagh-i- Malik), Helafigan (Hallagan), Idedj (Mai-Amir), by the Rah-i-Sul- tani to KaPa Madrassa, over the old bridge near God-i-Balutak, Pul-i* Amarat, and Diipulan to Ardal; over the Suledjan viaduct and the Gardan-i-Zarra to Kahv-i-Rukh. From Pul-i-Amarat it appears to have branched by Armen, Lurda- gan, Felat, Semiran, Kail or Kori to Kumishah, and again from Felat to Shiraz. JAFIRABAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

It forms the boundary between the Turko- Tartar and Kurd tribes; the frontier between the Turko-Tartars and Persians is situated further west. Near Suj Bulak the river is about 300 feet broad, and its water as clear as crystal, flows rapidly over pebbles; it is about one foot deep, and easily fordable. Gerard says that just outside the town of Miandab, it is about 80 yards broad, 3^ feet deep, and in the winter very difficult to ford owing to the floating ice. The valley of the Jagatu is inhabited by a tribe called the “ Char- daoris,” {Gerard—Thielmann — I. B. } W. 0. } Part I.) * The Jaddah-i-atabeg.JAH—JAH JAHANGTRAH—Lat. Long. Elev.

A town in Ears, 63 miles south-west of Darab, and 90 miles south east of Shiraz. It consists of a walled fort of great length and in good condition, situated near rocky mountains, which lie on the south-east of it, and extend in a direction east and west. The town is said to contain within and without the walls 3,000 families. The walls are of recent construction and are about 3 miles in circumfer ence, but there are more houses outside than inside them. Many of the habitations possess turreted towers as places of defence. The land around Jahrum is principally irrigated with water drawn from wells (by bullocks), with which the plain is everywhere dotted. The scarcity of running water is extreme. This is the principal mart foi tobacco, which is brought here from all the surrounding districts and disposed of to traders, who distribute it over the country far and near. These traders are numerous, and many established here are wealthy; they usually transact their business in their private houses without resorting to the caravansarais, of which there are six in the place. The 'following is a rough estimate of the produce of tobacco in some of the neighbouring districts :— Mans of Galbasi = 720 miskals. Mds. • Prices. Lar ... (?) Kiran 1-1-10 per man.

The former are worth at Jahrum 9-14 for 25 mans; the rice, of which there may be 150,000 mans, sells at 1 for 2 mans. ’ . Some 30,000 to 40,000 tumans worth of English cotton imported from Tihran are disposed of annually at Jahrum. There are thirty dealers in these goods here; groceries, spices, and cotton manutactures 285286 are brought from India by Bandar Abbas, Assalu (?), and Bushahr. Grapes, dates (its Shahani dates are renowned), water-melons, pome granates, figs, plums, apples, and fruits of the orange and lemon species grow here abundantly; the first-named are very excellent and sell at the ridiculously low price of one shald (a half-penny) for 720 miskals, or about 7 lbs. A considerable quantity of raisins is exported to India. Barley and wheat are not produced in this district in suf ficient quantity for consumption in consequence of the scarcity of water. There is a salt mine miles distant to the west. The district of Jahrum measures 30 miles by 15 miles, and con tains eighteen villages. {Abbott?) jAHRtJM—Lat. Long. Elev.

A plain in Luristan, on the left bank of the Kashghan river above its junction with the Karkhah. The plain is considerably elevated above the valley of the Karkhah, but still much lower than the high table-land beyond the ridges to the east. It is stated to be a perfect paradise in the spring, as well from its verdant herbage as from the quantities of wild flowers that enamel its surface. It is cultivated by some 300 families of Dih Nishlns of the Sllah-Silah divi sion of the Plsh-Kuh, and also affords winter pasture to the great tribe of Hasanawand. Mr. Schindler states that in his opinion the site of the ancient city of Shahpur Khast must be sought for on the Jaidar plain. The old bridge on the Jaidar plain is called the Pul-i-Shahpur, and there are numerous ruins scattered about. {Uawlinson — Schindler.) JAIHIRA (?) KHOR— Lat. 28* 9' 35'. Long. 51* 21' 10' Elev.

JANAKI GAKMSlR— A tribe of Khuzistan, dependent on the Bakhtiari Lurs, but from its numbers and influence generally regarded as the chief of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiaris. Its subdivisions are Zanganah, Mombeni, Makiyawand, Korzangenah, BuFawasI, (Abu-1-'Abbasi), Servistani, Kiyupi, Malagayl, Telari, Karah-baghI, Mai DawudI, Garaseri, TembI, Gurgeri, Beig-deli. Each division has its Chief (Kat-Khuda or Bish Safid), who has little authority except within his own encampment. Of the divisions above enumerated, the Mombeiri and Makiyawand are the most powerful, the former having between 800 to 900 excellent match- lockmen, the latter 500 to 600 equally good horsemen. The Jauaki Garmsir matchlockmen are considered as the best among the Bakhtiaris, and they are celebrated for personal courage. These tribes are chiefly Dih Nishlns, and very seldom visit their Sardsirs during the summer and autumn, being employed in their rice-fields. Their villages and encampments are chiefly in the plains of Bagh-i-Malik, in the valleys of Mai Daud and Mai Agha, and among the neighbouring low hills. The tribe of Mombeni occupies the valley of Mai Baud, the tribe of Zanganah the plain of Bagh-i-Malik, and the Makiyawand the country near Taulah and Gulglr. The tribes of JanakI Garmsir are the most peaceable of all the Bakhtiaris, seldom engaged in war, and neither given to plunder or robbery. They number about 5,000 families. [Bayard.)JAN—JAR JANAKl SARDSlR— A tribe of Khuzistan, dependent on the Bakhtiari Lurs, who inhabit Gandeman and Lurdagan, and the mountains in their vicinity, during the summer months, and Burs and the neighbourhood of the south branch of the Karun and Lurdas'an in the winter. Their sub- divisions are Jalili, Aurak, Yar Ahmadi, Monji, Bars!, Rig!, Mangar- muwi, Armandl, Bujeri, Bum, ShiyazI, Rafail, Mesenni (Mamaseni), Hellusadi, Sheruni, Satehi, Duderayi, Melasi, and 'Asherl. They num ber about 3,000 families, and are for the most part Dih Nishins, their Chief residing in the village of Lurdagan. They are neither cele brated for courage nor skill as matchlockmen, but have 500 to 600 good horsemen. The valleys of the Janakl Sardslr are, on the whole, not ill cultivated. Rice, corn, and V.arley are raised in abundance ; gardens and vineyards producing good fruit surround their villages, and the hills are thickly wooded with the dwarf oak [beloot) and other trees. [Layard.) JANAWARA, called aUo KALA JtJ—Lat. Long. Elev. A village of Persian Kurdistan, situated in a narrow valley, on the caravan tract between Sihna and Sulimanla.

A valley in Luristan to the east of the Bakhtiaii mountains. {Layard.) JARAHl, also GERA HI, and JALAHI— Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Khuzistan, which rises under the name of the Kur distan river, in the hilly country of Sarhadd Chiuar in the Bakhtiaii mountains to the north of Bihbahan. Thence it flows south, and passes the ruins of Kurdistan (where it already has a breadth of about 350 feet), and the village of Dih Dasht, through Tang-i-teka, a nar row defile, into the plain of Bihbahan, through which it winds about 4 miles from the town. Thence it flows north-west, as far_as Khallfah- abad, south of Ram Hurmuz, where it is joined by the Ab-i-Ala, and shortly after by the Tazang river. From this point it takes the name of Jarahl, and becomes a broad deep stream, not at any period of the year fordable, and runs between steep and high mud banks to the south-west to within 8 miles of Fel- lahiah, where it divides into two branches, one of which is genera % termed the Nahr Bus!, runs into the sea at Khor Musa, near Bandar Mashhur; the second continuing its course through Fellahlah is even tually lost in irrigation, except a small branch of it, which finds its way 288into the Karun, 10 miles above Muhammarah. The upper portion of this river, as far as the junction of the Ab-i-Ala, is well wooded with oak, walnut, rhododendron, and wild vine, but at this point it ceases. It is connected with the Karim by the canal which leaves that river at Sablah, and by this means Muhammarah and Basra are reached. It is navigable from the junction of the Ab-i-Ala for country boats, and Chesney says boats can ascend it from the Persian Gulf. This river is navigable for boats of 4 or 5 tons throughout its length, until within some 12 miles of Ram Hurmuz, the trip taking five days. There area great many boats on the river, perhaps not under 1,000. At the point where the Fellahiah canal leaves it it is a fine river, being compar ed by Colville with the Thames at Richmond. It has a mid-channel of 8 feet, with gently curving and well-defined banks, irregularly fringed with date-trees, and showing on either baud a well-framed breadth of land wdth numerous cattle and horses. In 1878 the district of Jarahi, which had previously belonged to Fellahlah was detached from it, and was placed under the chief of Dili Mulla, who agreed to pay 5,000 tumans revenue for it. {Kinneir — Chesney — Layard — DeBode — Belly—Colville — Ross.) Bell (1884) writes— “The river Jarahi, known to its junction with the Ab-i-Ramuz as the Kurdistan river, rising in the Kuhgehlu hills at Sadat, issues from them through the narrow gorge of Tang-i-Tekab (Tang-i-Teka), and, running along the foot of the low hills, receives its waters from numer ous tributary streams flowing from them, viz-, the Ab-i-Ramuz, Ab-i- AL, Ab-i-Zard, &amp;c. On the banks of its feeders are numerous ruins of the Kayanian and Sassanian periods, «.&lt;?., at Sadat, Mai-Dawud, Abu-l-Abas, Manjanik.” Between Jaizun and Bihbaban, it is fordable in several places. At Chahar Asia its breadth from bank to bank is 70 yards; its stream is in December swift, 3 feet deep and 45 yards wide. Its left bank is here covered with that thick brushwood tamarisk and oleander. Colonel Bell, on his route from Isfahan to Bihbahan reached the banks of the Rumaruu river (Kurdistan river) on the 12th June 1884; baro meter 27*95 // (1,400 feet); thermometer 102°. The artificial horizon became too hot to be lifted after it had been for 7 minutes exposed to the sun at 3 p.m. The river is from 60 to 80 yards wide, with a boul- dery bottom and swift current; its banks are here low and well wooded. . There is good pasture on the hill-sides in the vicinity, i.e., a dried up grass, 6 inches to 9 inches high. At 3-30 a.m., barometer 28' l' ; thermometer 70°. 'Wells writes about this river— “ December 5^—Last night our tent was pitched near the village of Koreyseh, of about fifteen inhabitants. A white frost and cold fog cover the land this morning, A stream from the direction of noith has first to be crossed, and 3 miles from camp the river Jarahi itself forms a formidable obstacle. From bank to bank it is 70 yards wide, and in flood would be at least 6 feet deep. It is a rapid stream, and even now, when only 45 yards wide, is only fordable by strong 289 19men, being up to the horses* girths. In spring it would he a nasty flood to pass. Fine cover of tamarisk and oleander marks its course, whilst beyond palm groves, villages, and cultivated ground present an unwonted scene of prosperity and security for this part of Peria. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain. JARUM. FiV/e Jahrum. JARZUN—Lat. Long. Elev.

[Stack.) KAHNtT—Lat. 27° 56' 49' N. Long. 57° 38' 2' E. Elev. A village in the province of Lar close to the borders of Persian Balu chistan. Floyer derives the name of the place from its “ kahnu,' or underground water-courses. He describes its situation as one of considerable importance, being “ on the road to everywhere.' It lies at the confluence of three broad shallow valleys, from the north, south, and west. Standing in the middle of the junction of these valleys, and facing due east, one can see, dotted thickly over the face of the opposing slope, some 400 good-sized oblong huts, large and strongly built, the frame-work being of fasces of strong cane-like reeds and the whole covered with pish matting. In the centre of these huts, near the top of the slope, is a large space, enclosed by a mud wall which contains the three or four somewhat bigger huts of the chief. Quite at the summit of the slope, and in a most imposing position stand the ruins of a considerable fort. Kahnu is a somewhat busy place, supporting three traders, who, however, generally come here from Karman on their way to the coast for further stores, and the goods they sell here are mostly such as will not go down anywhere else. The result is that young fellows go about in a perfect burlesque of the ordinary Persian dress. Supplies are difficult to obtain at Kahnu, but water is abundant and of excellent quality. And the whole valley is, as is natural with such an admirable drainage as it possesses, most fertile, and produces, besides wheat, mulberries, and dates, the valued red dye Runask. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahim, in his “Diary of a Journey through Minow, Shamil, and Kow Gunow,' speaks enthusiastically of the “ garden called Kahnu,' and says that it contains about a thousand fruit-trees, consisting of quinces, pomegranates, plums (alu Bukhara), apples, grapes, and figs, and a few walnut and almond trees. The fruit is carried in small loads to Bandar Abbas for sale. There are four large chunam tanks in con nection with this garden ; they seem of very old standing and can be filled by a fine stream of cold water, the temperature of which at 2 p.m., in August, is 72°. A large coniferous tree, called “ awars,' by the natives is said to grow on the top of the rock and to yield good timber295 KAH—KAI for the masts of the small boats. The garden is often visited by bears in quest of plums and other fruits. It is fine and cool during the day in August, the temperature at 6 a.m. being 77°; at 2 p„m. 88°; at 6 p.m. 82°; the nights very cold. Goldsmid says the climate in January is most enjoyable. The natives declare that in some parts of the rock there are spots which indicate that smelting furnaces existed, and that now the refuse of the working of some of the ores of metals (copper, iron, and lead) are lying about. Fragments of sulphur are also detected in some parts, while common salt is deposited from a briny spring at the foot of a rock towards the northern spurs. KAHNU—Lat. Long. Elev.

A fortress in Karmanshah, immediately overhanging the town of Zohab. This is the stronghold of Hulwan, to which Yazdijird, the last of the Sassanian kings, retreated after the capture of Ctesiphon by the Arabs, and it is a noble specimen of the labour which the monarchs of those ages bestowed upon their loyal buildings. It is formed by a shoulder projecting west from the mountain of Dalahu- gird upon three sides by an inaccessible scarp, and defended upon the other, where alone it admits of attack, by a wall and diy ditch of colossal dimensions, drawn right across from one scarp to the other, a distance of above 2 miles ; the wall is now in ruins, and the debris has fallen down into the ditch at foot, but still presents a line of defence of no ordinary description. The wall is flanked by bastions at regular intervals, and if an estimate may be formed from a pait of it which still preserves something of its original character, it would seem Plan of Kala-i-Tul Fort. 301302 to have been about 50 feet in height and 20 feet in thickness; the edge of the scarp has also been faced all round with a wall of less dimensions. The hill itself is elevated very considerably above the plain of Zohab, perhaps 2,000 feet; the slope from the plain is most abrupt, and it is everywhere crowned by a scarp, varying from 300 to 500 feet. The north side of the hill is higher than the south, and the table land therefore of the fort, containing about 10 square miles, presents an inclined surface throughout. At the north-east angle, where the scarp rises in a rocky ridge to its highest point and joins the mountain of Dalahu, there is a pass which conducts into the fort, the ascent rising gradually from the shoulder: the whole way from the town of Zohab is easy enough, but the descent on the other side into the table land of the fort is by a most precipitous and difficult gorge. A wall has been thrown across the jaws of the pass; towers have been erected on either side to support it; and somewhat lower down the defile, where the jutting rocks nearly meet, two strong castles have been built opposite to each other, which command the narrow entrance and render it quite secure against attack. Altogether this fortress may be considered to have been perfectly impregnable in an age when artillery was unknown. (Rawlinson.) KALA-I-ZUHAK—Lat. Long. Elev.

Bell, 16th June 1884, passed this place on the road from Bihbahan to Bushahr, and writes :— “ Leaving the uneven country, 2 to 3 miles from Kala Haidar, the country undulates gently to the village, which is built on a low sandy mound close to the shore : on the shore side it is surrounded by gar dens of melons. Wells are numerous, though the water in some of them is brackish and used for irrigation only. A narrow bank of sand, 12 feet high, here constitutes the coast line.

A rock fortress in Ears, 45 miles north-west of Shiraz. It is isolated, is 4 to 5 miles in length, 2 miles in breadth, and has a broad base, perhaps 5| miles in diameter, and does not become steep till near its summit where it presents an abrupt rampart, and its crest is said to be only accessible by three paths, only known to the Mamasem. There fs a road cut along the face of the rock defended by two towers and a sate. At the summit of the rock, which is about 1,000 feet above the plain, is a fine level plain about three-fou^ the soil fine and with numerous springs of water. It was taken botb by Alexander and Taimur. The only fortifications are a line of ^ huge stones ranged in regular order round the edges of the precipices. Each of these is wedged beneath by another of smaller dimensions, 303304 which, when removed, the large one is hurled in an instant from the top to the bottom, sweeping before it with irresistible force everything that tends to interrupt its course. It is a position of some importance, as it commands the high road to Shiraz from Khuzistan. The rock runs from north-west to south-east, and is composed of limestone lock, on all sides very precipitous, but least so towards the west. There is abundance of oak and other trees on its summit, and plenty of water, but no habitations. To the north runs the Talagun branch of the Tab river, nearly in a north-west direction. There are four principal entrances to the fort, which face to the north-east, south-east, west, and south west ; these are approached by very difficult and stony paths liable to have masses of rock thrown on them from above. Even in the present state of the neighbouring roads, guns might probably be brought with great labour near enough to the west entrance to cover an attacking party from a lower height close to it called the Shutar Khab; at all events a road could be constructed for that purpose, but the captuie of the fort in this manner, which must be attended with considerable loss as long as it could be strictly blockaded, seems a matter of doubtful importance, as its surrender, if shut out from the surrounding country, must soon follow from want oi supplies. It is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Shor, which at this point is joined by a stream from the north. The main stream is 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep. It has a rapid current.

Rawlinson writes“ Kila Shakin, immediately contiguous to the old city of Halwan, was unquestionably included in the territory of the Kurdish prince of Dartaug and Damah, who, at the time of the treaty of 1639 in the reign of Murad IV. of Turkey and Shah Suffi of Persia, or at any rate shortly before it, ruled over Zohab and the whole of the adjoining mountains. The lands of Kala Shakin indeed were only purchased by the Kalhur chief from the lurkish proprietors about 40 years ago, and I have always heard in this country the right of Persia to Gilan placed in precisely the same category with her claims upon the Pashalik Zohab.” KALA TURAGH—Lat.

KALHURS— . . , p TT _ _ , T A tribe of Karmanshah who inhabit the district or Harunabaa. it is the most powerful in the neighbourhood, and can bring a large body of men into the field. Their features are handsome and manly. They number 7,000 families, or 11,500, according to Shiel, and spend the winter in the neighbourhood of Mendall in the province of Bagh dad. They are of the J All-1 lain sect, and their holy place is the tomb of Baba Yadgah in the pass of Zardah. There is a section of this tribe who inhabit a part of the province of Sulimania and number 200 families. Shiel says this tribe are Laks. He adds that the women are handsome, the men tall and strong and excellent marksmen. {Rawlinson — Jones — Chesney — Malcolm — Rich — Shiel.) Regarding this tribe, Mr. T. C. Plowden gives the following information (1881) :— “ The territory of the Kalhurs is more extensive, and comprises a greater proportion of well-watered and fertile land than that of any other in Karmanshah. Along the Turko-Persian frontier, their pos sessions extend from the neighbourhood of Mendali to the borders of Kasr-i-Shmn: inland to the east they include the rich valleys of Gilan, Darah, Kalah, Shakin, Chulah, Kifrawar, Gahwara, the plain of Rawandasht, Shahinl and Shuan, Mandarak, Kamarzat, Ziwari, and a portion of the great valley of Mahidasht. “ In recent years bad harvests, verging on famine, misgovernment, and tribal disputes, have exhausted their resources; three-fourths of the land lies untilled, and the strength of the tribe has dwindled from upwards of 50,000 to something less than 6,000 families. This diminution has happened during the last five years, and is due, first, to scarcity, almost amounting to famine, which prevailed for three years, both in the frontier districts of Persia and in Turkish Arabia; second ly, to the loss of sheep and cattle, which perished in large numbers for want of food; and, finally, to the exactions of their different chiefs.KAL—KAL “ The Kalhurs are of a Jewish cast of countenance— a circumstance which has caused Sir H. Rawlinson to fancy that they may he descend ants of the Samaritan captives who were placed in the Assyrian city of Kalhur Hal ah, identified with Sir-i-pul-i-Zohab on the main road from Baghdad to Karmanshah. The tribe is divided into the fol lowing clans or septs :— Families. 1. Slab-Slab . . . 1,000 2. Beg-Zadab-Slah-S!ab and , Mutta (P) Mulla-Siab-Siah 100 3. Kaladi (?) ... 600 4. Sbabarik (?)

Bastakl Total . 6,000 [N.B .— These names are, for tbe most part, misprints, it is believed; they are given bere for wbat they may be worth.] The land occupied by the Kalhurs ismilkiat (or “ private property^) i.e., the proprietary right is vested in the chief of the tribe, and not in the Shah or (except when they have bought their fields for money) in individual members of the tribe. It rests with the chief to distribute the land for cultivation as he pleases. The usual arrangement, in case of “ abl ” land, is for the raiyat to provide all the labour and seed; after the corn crop has been threshed, he takes as his own share two-thirds of the gross produce, leaving the remaining third for the malik (or “ owner ”). When the land is “ daim ” the cultivator takes three shares out of the four. . The cultivator also pays as “ maliat ” an annual sum m cash which varies in amount according to his own supposed capabilities and the exigencies or rapacity of the malik. The relations of the chief with the Government are of a two-fold character : First, he is Sartip (or Colonel-in-Chief) of the military contingent which the tribe has to furnish ; secondly, he is Hakim (or Civil Governor) of the Kalhur country, and is responsible foi the revenue (maliat) due from the landed possessions of the tiibe. ^ The appointment of Sartip is made by the Shah, and that of Hakim by the Governor of Karmanshah; consequently, the two appointments are not always united in the same individual. . The military force which the Sartip of the Kalhur is piopeily bound to furnish for the service of the State, consists of 3 regiments of foot. 307 20 aKAL—KAL each 100 strong-, and 1,000 horse; but in practice he only maintains 100 foot, and no cavalry, except a small personal retinue of some 200. A fixed sum is allowed the Sartip for the expenses of this force, which sum is usually deducted from the maliat. The ruling family of the Kalhurs belongs to the Shahbazi clan. Muhammad Hasan Khan is the present chief (1881) ; but his nephew, Raza Kuli Khan, is reported to have the most influence with the tribe. The Shahbazi clan claim to have migrated, in the remote past, from Isfahan* to their present abode. Muhammad Ali Khan, Chief of the Kalhurs, died about 40 years ago, leaving three sons, Muhammad Husain, Muhammad Hasan, and Zain-ul-Ab-i-din. The eldest suc ceeded his father, but after a time resigned the chiefship, which then devolved upon his second brother, Muhammad Hasan Khan. Zin-ul- Ab-i-din, the youngest brother, bribed the authorities and procured his brother’s imprisonment for two years_ at Karmanshah and his subse quent removal to Tihran. Zain-ul-Ab-i-din held the ehiefship for 2| years, and established a character as a determined but harsh and tyrannical ruler. He quarrelled with his son, Raza Kuli Khan, whom he turned out of his tents, and left to support himself as best he could. Eventually Zain-ul-Ab-i-din and some of his principal adherents were taken by surprise and slain in the pass of Ismail Beg near Harunabad, in revenge for the murder of Asad Beg, a leading member of the tribe. When this happened Imad-ud-Daula was Governor of Karmanshah ; he recalled Muhammad Hasan Khan from Tihran and re-appointed him Hakim of the Kalhurs. Muhammad Hasan Khan retained the governorship for many years, until his nephew, Raza Kuli Khan, who had in the meantime grown up, seized the opportunity of a change of Governors at Karmanshah to secure his uncle’s deposition and his own appointment as Hakim of the Kalhurs. This happened about six or seven years ago, and notwith standing the frequent changes in the Governorship of Karmanshah which have since occurred, Raza Kuli Khan managed to retain his position until the spring of the present year, when, in consequence of his failure to deal effectually with the Ahmadawans, he was removed, and his uncle, Muhammad Hasan Khan, was once more summoned from Tihran and re-instated provisionally in his old position. When Mr. Plowden passed through Sir-i-pul, he found Muhammad Hasan encamped under the bridge over the Hulwan with a small body of Sinjabi and Kalhur horse. A few days later Muham mad Hasan called on him at his camp at Payintak. He is liked by the people, who find him comparatively a mild and easy ruler. Mr. Plowden did not see Raza Kuli Khan, who was at Chelu, within easy reach of the frontier, in case circumstances should render it advisable for him to take refuge in Ottoman territory; he is a young man of about 30 years of age, more capable and of more vigorous character than his uncle. During the six year's of his governorship, his rule was severe and probably cruel, but he kept his people in order. He is a “ Chadar Nishin,” and * As a matter of fact, the Kalhurs have, I believe, dwelt on the mountains of Zagros overlooking Zohab and Sulimania from a very early antiquity. 308MiniMiiiiiiiiiiiiifiiiiiiiiniiiii mm 309 KAL—KAM all his four wives are of Kurdish stock—two circumstances which go far to secure his popularity with the tribe, and, as a matter of fact, notwithstanding his recent removal from office, two-thirds of the Kalhurs are reckoned as his adherents. {Plowden, 1881.)

A port on the coast of Ears, east of Cape Bardistan, formed by a deep bay, which here indents the coast. The town has about 1,400 inhabit ants—Arabs of the Bani Hasn, Bani Khalid, Akriya, Albusharif, Albuzareh, Alyia, Bani Amud, Abadali, Kashianaria, and Nasur tribes. Several of the finest buggalows in the Persian Gulf belong to this port, and they carry on a very extensive trade, principally as carriers to Bombay and the Malabar Coast, and to most of the ports of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. The bay is perfectly sheltered from north westerly winds by Cape Bardistan and the reefs of it, and partially from south-eastern by Ras-ul-Mara. The best anchorage is with the north-west tower of the town north-east by compass, and Bardistan fort and the sugarloaf, or conical, hill nearly in one, north 57°, west in 4 or 44 fathoms. Supplies of indifferent cattle are procurable here, and also excellent water and firewood. The town was formerly of more importance, having a population of some 6,000 or 7,000, and having been a Portuguese settlement in former years, the ruins of a factory and a half-moon casemated battery are still standing close to the water-line, as are also the ruins of a breakwater. It was destroyed by the Dashti chiefs through the jealousy of its prosperity, but is now recovering itself in a measure. The whole country from Cape Bardistan to Asilu is under this place. This district, which is sometimes called Ganbandi-Kangun, comprises the sea-ports of Kangun, Nakhiluh, Assaluh, Tahirl, &amp;c., and the islands Shaikh Shuaib and Hindarabi, and some thirty villages inland. It was governed by Shaikh Mazkur-bin-Jabbarah, who was continually in conflict with the authorities, and in 1878 defeated the troops of the Kuwwam-ul-Mulk. He was subsequently made prisoner and strangled in 1880. Kangun is now under the jurisdiction of the prince at Shiraz. Morier says that in his day the Shaikh of Kangun could raise 2,000 cavalry. There is a road from this to Eiruzabad, which is said to be practicable for guns. The town contains 6,000 to 7,000 inhabitants, and has an excellent roadstead, where a frigate may ride at safety in the most tempestuous weather. Some trade is carried on with Basra, Maskat, and the different towns on the Persian and Arabian coasts. {Bruchs — Morier — Jones — Pelly — Ross — Stacki) KANIAN—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,000'.

Of its course from this point and its outlet to the sea, nothing was known till the discovery of a map executed by Haji Mirza Saiad Hasan, physician to the Governor of Bihbahan, who has some know ledge of surveying, and who compiled the map during twelve years' travel in Ears. After passing Mubarakabad the river flows in a southern direction, and then turns west, and from this point is identified with the Hand river of Dashti, and has its outlet in the Khur-Ziarat. Regarding the points at which the Kara Agach is better known, it is described at Khana-i-Zanian, where its elevation is 6,100 feet, as a clear mountain stream which the road crosses by a stone bridge. It enters the Kavar plain by a defile between the mountains which guard the Shiraz plain on the west and another ridge. Here, from time im memorial, a stone dam has supplied water to the canal which irrigates the Kavar plain. The dam is necessary because the level of the river here is considerably below that of the plain. Near Mubarakabad the river is a strong turbid stream 60 yards wide, and flows between high banks. It is crossed by a very curious two-storeyed bridge, the roadway being in the second storey. The centre of the bridge, which is called Pul-i-Arus (Bride's Bridge), stands 40 feet above the stream, but the flood-mark is half-way up the piers. The name Kara Agdch has two significations, “ Black wood, ” which is a literal translation of the Turkish word; but, besides this, it is the Turkish name for the elm tree. No district of precisely this name having been known by geographers hitherto, the derivation of the name, as applied to the river, has been in doubt; but in the Haji s map refer red to, there is a Sahra (^/ai»)-i-Kara Agach, south-east of Karzin.KAR—KAR 314 The principal tributaries of the river are, a stream which, rising* north east of Jahrum and, flowing in a westerly direction, joins the Kara Agach between Taduan and Mubarakabad; the Firuzabad river which, rising north of the town of the same name, has a southerly course, flowing west of Babu Nej, and joins the big river at a place called Pasrudak, about longitude 52,° 15'. A little east of this point also is a tributary from the south-east, which rises east of, and flows past, Alla Mardasht on the Bushahr-Lar road. Near Baghan on the same road the Kara Agach is joined by the river Riz and a little higher up by another tributary from the north. From this point it is known as the Mand, or Mund, river, and finds its way to the sea by the Khur-i-Ziarat creek. This river was known to the ancients as the Sitakus or Sitioganus; the earliest mention of it occurs in Arrian’s Indica (chap. 38), who quotes from Nearchos, Alexander’s Admiral, who made the voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. Pliny also has borrowed details. Next comes Ptolemy (second century post Christum), whose knowledge of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf is evidently based on log-books from the time of the Ptolemean dynasty in Egypt and the first Roman Emperors. The Arabic geographers know the river quite well, and described its course with great accuracy, as can be seen by examining Istakhri’s “ Kitab-ul-Mamalik Yal Masalik.” Colonel Ross, in his report on the administration of the Persian Gulf Residency for 1877-78, has placed it beyond doubt that the Kara Agach is identical with the Mand, Mund or Kaki river, which debouches into the Khor Ziavat in Dashti. It waters the Kavar plain, b\it is barred from Shiraz by the moun tains which guard the Shiraz plain on the west. [lioss — Stack.) KARABA—Lat. Long. Elev.

In the latter part of its course, it forces its way through the Zagros by a tremendous gorge into the plain of Zangawan. Thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirwan as it passes in a south-south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zangawan, Ab-i-Shirwan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west. (Rawlinson.) It flows south-east and joins the Karasu and Karkhah in Zangawan; the united stream is called the Karkhah. (St. John’s Map.) KARlND—Lat. 34° 16' 59 // . Long. Elev. 5,500 / . A town in Karmanshah, 41 (Rozario 60) miles west of that place, and 171 miles from Baghdad, on the road between the two places. It is de scribed by Fraser as grotesquely, rather then picturesquely, placed at the mouth of a gorge between two precipitous hills. The houses, though small, are neat and built in terraces on the slope of the gorge, with the naked and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Rich gardens extend up the defile and along the base of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits,including the celebrated stoneless grape known as that of Katind. The willow and the lofty poplar attain a considerable size on the margin of a mountain stream that bisects the village, and is after wards turned off into smaller channels for the supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs issuing from the plain, which is here about 3 miles broad, add their water to numerous mountain streams and form the sources of the Ab-i-Karind, the north-west tributary of the Karkhah river. Kariud is famous for its cutlery and hardware. The temperature is very mild; when Jones visited it in August the maximum point of the thermometer was only 85°. A mild east wind prevails throughout the nights, and is followed by a refreshing west wind that lasts during the day. The village of Karlnd formerly counted about a thousand houses; now it contains hardly six hundred. Population probably 3,000. The people are poor, and live mainly by cultivation ; their only industries are carpet-weaving, cutlery, and gun-making, all on a very small scale. The workmen are naturally clever and have succeeded in manufacturing a rough imitation of the Peabody-Martini rifle; they cannot make the cartridges, but recap the old copper cases by hand, and use them over and over again till worn out.KAR—KAR 317 The inhabitants belong to a sect called 'All Illahis and are divided into four class or tribes, viz.) the Zardah, Shuar, Nau Darwan, and Nau Chem. Some families of domiciled Jews carry on a remunerative trade and deal in medicine also. There are several mills in the town, of which Floyer gives the following description : A convenient spot is chosen whence to take the water, and a wall, the top of which is plane with the horizon and trough-shaped, built to lead it to the mill. A thick block of wood in the shape of a truncated cone is suspended underneath the fall of water. This cone is provided with flanges, going diagonally down its side in such a way that the effect of the water is to make it revolve. Under this is a trough to catch the water after it has done its work. The bush is connected by strings to the upper grinding stone, which consequently revolves and is so hung as to work lightly on the lower stone. The fine caravansarai built by Shah Abbas is now a ruin. The chief man of Karind in 1882 was Karim Khan. ( Fru,ser Kinneir — Jones — Taylor—Ferrier — Rawlinson — Floyer — Plowden — Gerard.') KARlNDl (KIRRINDlS)— # This tribe inhabit the neighbourhood of Karind in Karmanshah. Their country extends from the plain of Bishawah to Khusruabad, 12 miles from the village of Karind towards Harunabad. Beyond this is the Kalhur country, The taluk of Karind is the property of the chiefs of the tribe, who are said to derive their origin, six generations back, from Isfahan. They bought Karind about 120 years ago fiom the chief of the Gurans of Kala Zanjir, to whom it belonged. The arrangements for cultivation are the same as those which pievai amono- the neighbouring Kalhurand Guran tribes (^.v.). The pres ent chief is both Hakim and Sartip. In the latter capacity he holds’ a farman from the Shah, and furnishes a regiment of infantry, sup posed to be 800 strong, and a detachment of 200 horse. The latter are all Hamawands of the Baitavi clan. The chief is also Hakim ol Zohab, which territory he holds in farm from the Shah; tor the Mahall of Zohab is “ Miri,” that is, the proprietary right m it belongs to the Shah. Last year the engagement for the farm was 12,000 tumans for the current year (1881), the amount has not yet been fixed If there were a firm and settled government, the yield of Zohab might be made six times as great as it now is. The Karindis are estimated at 2,000 families. The recent history of the chiefs of Karind is not' without' interest. Some 50 years ago Hyat Kuli Khan, son of Malik Niaz Khan, was chief of Karind, and HajI Khan, a Turkuman of Khoi in Azarbaijan, was Governor of Karmanshah. One winter Haji Khan visited Karind, and sorely oppressed the people, not only by his pecuniary exactions, but especially by forcing them to yield their wives and daughters to his desires. In vain the Saiads of the town laid the Koran before him and entreated his forbearance. Haji Khan would not listen to them. At length the people could stand it no longer, and rising against him, attacked the house in which he was living. Haji Khan barricadedKAR—KAR all the doors, and for a time kept his assailants at bay. The latter, however, were thoroughly roused, and, climbing on the terrace, broke through the roof and effected an entrance. They made short work of Haji Khan. A massacre of his attendants followed; every man of them who pronounced the word “ Gosht with a Turkuman accent was cut down. After this event Hyat Kuli Khan ruled Karind more or less continually until his death. He left four sons, Malik Niaz Khan, Abbas Kuli Khan, 'All Murad Khan, and Karim Khan. Malik Niaz Khan, the eldest, succeeded his father, and lost his life about 15 years ago in an expedition against the Ahmadawands (Hamawands). His horse ran away and carried him to the enemies' tents, where he was shot. His second brother, Abbas Kuli Khan, succeeded to the chiefship, and died suddenly about five years ago at Karmanshah. The chiefship then devolved upon 'Ali Murad Khan, who now holds it, and whose acquaintance I made at Payintak. He is a good-looking man of about forty-five with as fair a skin as any Englishman; his manners were courteous, simple, and unaffected, and his remarks on current events were sensible and to the point. He lives on excellent terms with his younger brother, Karim Khan, who resides at Karind to look after the civil government and superintend the education, such as it is, of the younger members of the family, the sons of 'Ali Murad and of the deceased Malik Niaz. 'Ali Murad takes charge of the frontier, and is generally marching from one place to another in the Garmsir. They tell the following story of his dash and courage. Some twelve years ago when Midhat Pasha was Wali of Baghdad, one of 'Ali Murad's cousins went to Khanikiu, attended only by four followers, to buy horses. The Ottoman authorities seized and imprisoned him on the plea that he had really come to make mischief. 'Ali Murad Khan remonstrated warmly, both locally and at Tihran and Baghdad, against this arbitrary act, but failed to obtain redress. At length, choosing a suitable night, he dashed off to Khanikin, taking with him scaling ladders and fifty picked horsemen; he attacked the official quarters (sarai) of the Mutasarif of Khanikin and released, not only his cousin, but forty other prisoners as well. One of his own men and two or three Turks were killed in the scrimmage. (Plotcden.) KARIfJN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the district of Bidshahr, Ears, the governor of which in 1882 was Lutf 'Ali Khan. The village, which once must have contain ed 2,000 inhabitants, had only three families at the time of Stack's visit. It is on the road from Lar to Eiruzabad. There is a mud fort close to the village, and two others in the plain about a mile to the east. One of the latter is the mud fort (Kala-i-Gili) built when Karim Khan was reigning in Shiraz (1780); it is a square earthwork with a side of 120 yards, and had a tower every 12 yards. The other is the fort of the Eire well, so called from the discovery of naphtha in a well hard by; it is a tower fort with a wall on a mound. Ports and well are in ruins now. * The word is pronounced “ Geusht” in Turkish. 318319 iMMWiinwnniHiiiniiii i KAR—KAR Kariun stands in the middle of three rocky hills, and these also are said to have been fortified. The tradition of the place is that Shah Karan was besieged here by 12,000 Mussalmans, when the Arabs first invaded Persia. While they were at their prayers, he sallied out and slew them all without resistance. In the Mussalman camp were 40 virgins, 37 of whom, in answer to their prayer for deliverance, were swallowed up by the earth. The remaining three fled in various directions. The cave which sheltered one is called Ghar Bibi, or Lady's Cave, to this day. The second died of exhaustion at a spot where the shrine called Bibi Darmanda or Tired-out Lady is, a famous place for childless wives. Lajat, who had conquered Kir, hearing of the catastrophe, came to avenge his brother, but could not take the fort until Shah Karan was betrayed by his wife, who was a second Delilah, and who had fallen in love with Hajat. Hajat married and then killed her, as he had no wish to be betrayed. Being informed that the way to find Shah Karan's treasure was to make blood flow down the hill-side, he proceeded to cut the throats of the inhabitants at the top of the hill, and an old woman, when her turn came, revealed the secret, by advising him to get the great store of wine from the vaults and pour that down the hill-side; the last jar of wine hid the door of the trea sure house. Kariun was evidently once a flourishing and well-built place. Conical domes of ahambars rise among the ruined houses, testi fying to a large water-supply and a large population in former years. The neighbourhood is infested by robbers, and the few remaining in habitants complain of the misgovernment of the Kajars. As a proof of the insecurity of property, it may be observed that the herdsmen on the hills are armed with guns. The surrounding country in good seasons ought to be very fertile, and there is some very fine wheat under Kariun. An ancient kanat waters the village, and Lutf All Khan attempted to make another unsuccessfully. [Stack.) KARIZ. See Asadabad. KARKERlA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in Khuzistan upon which Shustar is built. It is bridged at Shustar by a stone bridge, across which a coach might be driven but for the holes; and it is quite 50 feet high above the water. The most singular feature of it is that it is built in a ziz-zag, and that it has immense piers to the buttresses, some of which seem to have held water-wheels. The parapet is very low, and the whole thing much out of repair. Below it it is an immense weir, over which the river falls with a deafening roar. A fine arched gateway shuts it off from the city, and just above stands the castle. [Blunt.) KARKHAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Persia, which rises in three branches, all springing con siderably east of Karmanshah. The first, and most inconsiderable, has its commencement about 25 miles west of Hamadan. The second has three springs on the side of mount Elvand, 6 or 8 miles south of that place. The latter runs south-westward till it meets the former in the320 plain of Maran, about 10 miles south-west of Kangawar; and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place it is joined by the third, or chief, branch of the Karkhah, which comes from the Guran mountains by a north-west course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams, under the name of the Gamasiab river (of which the second abovementioned may, from its northern and central position, be considered as the main branch), winds for nearly 30 miles in a general westerly direction to Bisaitin, chiefly along the Guran mountains. At this celebrated spot the Gamasiab receives the Ab-i-Dinawar coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream, called the Kara Su, passing through Karmanshah at about 20 miles north-north-west of that place. The direction of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from thence a tributary coming from the Guran mountains by a westerly course, and passing by the tomb of Baba Buzurg. Below this junction, under the name of Kara Su, it runs south by west for nearly 60 miles, travers ing the Kuh-i-Turdulan and plain of Tihrau in the district of Pish Kuh, and, finally, through the great chain of the Zagros to the ruins of Shahri Budbar, which are situated at its confluence with the river of Karind. This is a very considerable stream, which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a general south-east direction. In the latter part of its course it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous gorge, into the plain of Zangawan, being then at a distance of about 12_miles east of the ruins of Shlrwan. From thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirwan, as it passes in a south south-east direction through the valley of Rud- bar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zangawau, the Ab-i-Shirwan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west. The united waters of Kara Su and ivb-i-Shlrwan, now called the Karkhah, follow the Zagros in a south south-east direction for about 30 miles, through the plains of Lurt and Saimarah as far as Pul-i- Gamashan. At 8 miles east of the ruins of Saimarah, and one mile above the bridge, the Karkhah is joined on the north-east side by the Kashghan, a large stream which rises in two branches on the Kuh-i- Chihal Na Balighan, at some distance beyond Khuramabad in the plain of Kuhdasht, and, after being joined by the united streams of Khuramabad, Kayun, and Tayin, the main trunk runs south-westward, through the plain of Jaidar and over a number of precipices, forming a succession of magnificent cataracts, as it struggles through the outer rampart of the Zagros into the valley of the Karkhah, some thousand feet below the hills. At about 22f miles south-east of the bridge of Gamashan, the Karkhah receives the Ab-i-Garm, a smaller stream coming from the north; and at about 33j miles south-east from thence is Pul-i-Tang, a very remarkable bridge over a chasm, which is here 150 feet deep, and so narrow that a Kurd actually leaped across it in the presence of Major Kawlinson. Having overcome this obstacle, the river resumes its ordinary size; and 8 miles lower it is joined by the Ab-i-Zal, which enters it after at KAR—KAR course of about 50 miles from its source in the fastnesses of the Kal-i- Aspld and Anarahrud. The Karkhah leaves the mountains west of Dizful within 10 miles of that river. At this spot it is a rapid moun tain stream, and at its entrance into the plain it was formerly crossed by a bridge, the remains of which are Pul Pal. Immediately below this bridge the river is fordable during summer, and this ford is generally used by horsemen. It is, however, difficult owing to the rapidity of the current. Their united streams now quit the direction of Dizful, and take a more southerly course for about 40 miles to the ruins of Iwani Kar khah. At Iwani Karkhah, the river divides itself into four branches, and is easily fordable in summer and autumn. A little south of this spot, where there are the remains of a bridge, and at one mile and a half from the celebrated ruins of ancient Sus, the Karkliah bends a little west of south, and continues in this direc tion through the rich plain of Khuzistan, passing through the exten sive marshes which surround Hawizah; from thence it winds south west and falls into the Shatt-ul-Arab, 5 miles below Kurnah, after a course of upwards of 500 miles. A little way on the eastern side of the Karkhah is the Shapur, or Shawur, which is supposed to rise in the rich plains between that river and the Ab-i-Dizful, at about 10 miles north of Sus; and instead of entering the Karan below Ahwaz, as in the earliest times, or about 14 miles below Wais, as is said to have been the case at a later period, it makes its way, according to the accounts of the natives through marshes, immediately into the upper part of the river Diz. Below Iwan the banks of the river are thickly wooded, and prob ably the river would here be navigable for vessels of small burden; at all events, it might be rendered so as far up as Hawizah. The water of the Karkhah in. the upper part of its course is cele brated for its purity, but below Hawizah it receives much stagnant water from marshes. This river has several names, viz .— 1. Khuramabad. 2. Madiyan Rud. 3. Kashghan. 4. Saimarah. (q.v.) There is one partially effective dam on the Karkhah at Nahr Hashim in Arabistan. The tribes of Khuzistan who dwell on the banks of this river are— Al-bu-Riwayah. Akrish. Bani Nahd. Daghaghlah. Ghazli. Marawanah. Shamamrah. (q.v.) These are all independent clans of the K^ab tribe. [Rawlinson — Layard — Chesney — Ross — Robertson.) 321 21 21322 H- KAR—KAR KARMANSHAH (PROVINCE)— Eat. Long. Elev. A district of Persia, lying between Lat. 34° to 35°, Long. 44° 5' to 4 8°. It is bounded north by the mountains of Persian Kurdistan; east by two petty governorships of Kangawar and Asadabad, which separate Karmanshah from the province of Hamadan, south by Luristan- i-Kuchak; and west by the Vilayat of Baghdad in Turkish Kurdistan. It is said to have a thousand villages. Under the government of Muhammad 'AH Mirza this was one of the most flourishing provinces in the empire, but since his death it has been subject to the most grinding tyranny, and now it everywhere presents a scene of ruin and desolation. Formerly it produced a con siderable revenue, but now a great diminution has been the result of oppression naturally. Karmanshah is a peculiarly productive part of Persia, the mountains are as much so as the plains, and on these hundreds of thousands of sheep can be reared. The Kurds of the mountains of Karmanshah in a great degree supply Tihran, whither each spring they take as many as 70,000 sheep. A great number also go to Turkey, and it seems probable that the nomads of Karmanshah will eventually send the whole of their flocks destined for sale to that country in preference. The horses of this province are esteemed and have much Arab blood, but their form is more developed, the neck is strong, chest full, and they are as well adapted for draught as for the saddle. The carpets of Karmanshah are a manufacture which adds much to the wealth of the province ; none can be more rich, soft, and beautiful; the patterns are in perfect taste, and the colours most bril liant, but these are not their only merits, for they are cheap and very durable. These carpets are made in the villages and in the tents of the nomad tribes, generally by the- women and children. Here there is no complicated machinery: four stakes fixed in the ground, which serve to twist the woollen thread, form the simple mechanism employed in weaving these beautiful carpets. Manna {ghazangubin) abounds in the province of Karmanshah. The Persians mix it with flour and sugar and make it into little cakes; these they consider great dainties and export them to all parts of Asia. {Kinneir — Vnisley — Ferrier — Rawlinson!) The province of Karmanshah may be termed the granary of Persia. A rough estimate, made by several natives, of the surplus produce of the province gives a total of 380,000 kharwars, or 139,333 tons of wheat and barley as ready to be placed in the market after the last harvest (1875) at the low price of 8 kirans per kharwar. Wheat was unsaleable as late in the year as November, and it was stated that many large land-owners had their granaries filled with wheat of the preceding year, which must be given to the cattle, or even burnt, to make room for the new crop. Except in seasons of extreme scarcity, the country might be relied on to supply a very large force in all that would be necessary to enable it to traverse the barren tracts beyond.113 KAR—KAR Mules, camels, and horses are bred in large numbers, and forage is plentiful.

Land is divided into “ daim,” or rain-watered land, and “ dbi, ” or land irrigated artificially. Corn crops alone are grown on daim land, which lies fallow every alternate year. Abi land is sown with grain crops one year, and with a garden crop of melons, cucumbers, and the like, in the following year. The land belonging to a village is not cultivated in common; each field is divided by a furrow and a few stones. The principal trees are willow, poplar, oriental plane, and walnut. Sheep and goats. —300,000 in number, about 20,000 lambs and kids are produced yearly. About 10,000 sheep, lambs, and goats are driven for sale to Tihran and other places in Persia, and to Baghdad. (T. C. Plow den.) The province of Karmanshah was bounded on the south by Kuchak; jon the west by Ottoman territory included within the Vilayat of Baghdad; on the north by Persian Kurdistan under the Governor of Sihna; and on the east by two petty governorships of Kangawar and Asadabad which separate Karmanshah from the province of Hamadan.

The majority of the Gurans,* the Karindis and Sinjabis, are bAlI Ilahis. People are very mysterious as to the tenets and practices of this sect, and do not readily converse on the subject. The following is a resume of information which Mr. Plowden collected at different times as opportunity arose. The cardinal principle of the 'All Ilatff faith is the substitution of ’All, the son-in-law of the Prophet, not merely for Mahomed, but for God. Every year at the commencement of winter there is a great festival, which ends with a three days' fast. The festival is in honour and in remembrance of 'All and of the great things he has done for his followers. A leading tradition upon which their belief in the divinity of 'AH mainly rests was related to me as follows - During the religious wars which ensued after the death of Maho med, 'Ali, accompanied by a certain Musayir, was about to engage in battle with the Arabs. Musayir’s mother implored 'All to bring back her son alive. In the fight Musayir was killed, but God ac cepted 'All's intercession and restored the dead man to life. This resuscitation of Musayir was repeated on six subsequent occasions through 'All’s influence, with the result that Musayir began to reve rence 'All as God, and as 'All’s conquests proceeded and were signalised by many miracles, the general public also began to look upon him as the Almighty. In remembrance and in perpetual proof of Musayir having been seven times restored to life, his descendants have ever since consisted of seven families, never more nor less. No one, how ever, knows where the descendants of Musayir reside, though they are to be recognised by a red mark on the neck, which all of them carry. Saiad Rustain is the name of the present chief priest of the 'All Ilahis, and he lives at Zarda, the sacred place of the sect on Mount Dalahu. There is a tomb in which nobody is buried, but which is venerated under the title of “ Baba Yadgah-i-Husain.' The 'Ali 1 lahis have no religious books; they do not keep Ramazan, and they rarely, if ever, pray. They say that 'Ali is their intercessor, and that he has commanded them to trust in the efficacy of his prayers, and that their own are superfluous and useless. In short, 'Ali is their intercessor with God. Before undertaking any important matter, and * The rest of the Guransare Sunis. 325KAR—KAR 326 especially before going to war, the 'AH Ilahis invoke bAH in the name of Daoud, saying “ Oh Daoud, we are going to war, grant us aid that we may overcome our enemies/' They then sacrifice some beast, usually a sheep ; the blood and the offal are buried, and the rest of the animal is roasted whole. When it is cooked the carcase is carried to the priest, who separates the bones and kneads the flesh into a paste, muttering prayers over it as he proceeds. When he has finished this consecration a table-cloth is spread on the ground, and every one present partakes of the sacramental food which the priest distributes. After this ceremony the undertaking, whatever it may be, is entered upon with perfect confidence of ultimate success. The marriages of the 'All Ilahis are supposed to require the sanction of Saiad Rustain, the chief priest, but resort is not unfrequently had to Shiah Mullas. The dead are buried without prayer, but the head of the corpse faces the kibla, as amongst Muhammadans. On the birth of a child the father or mother give it its name, but if the family is well-to-do, a Saiad is invited to a feast on the seventh day after the birth, and is called upon to name the child. Occasionally, if the demand is good, and the supply at Karmanshah has been plentiful, grain and gin are sent to Isfahan, Hamadan, Yazd, Karman, and Baghdad. The price of wheat in cheap years ranges from 7 kirans to 1 tuman for a kliarwar of 100 mans* Tabrizi. People have known the price as low as and 5 kirans. This year (1881) the harvest was excellent, and, except that, owing to the scarcity of seed, the area sown was comparatively small, the yield would have been very large. Mr. Plowden watched a party of rayats harvesting their crop ; they told me the return had been sixteen-fold at least. Then they began to grumble about the exactions of the “ malik,' who took from them 6 measures out of every 100 measures of grain, in addition to his legitimate share of one-third, and they also had to pay from 1 tuman to 5 kirans.

A town, the capital of the district of the same name in Persia, about 2.50 miles south-west of Tihran, 262 miles west-north-west of Isfahan, 220 miles north-east of Baghdad, 303 miles south-south-east of Tabriz by Silma, and 380 by Zanjan. The town is built on the rising ground, which is connected with hills to the south, and its situation is most picturesque and imposing from being surrounded with gardens. The walls of the city are 3 miles in circumference and are in ruins, and the moat much encumbered with their debris, so that it is now an open town. It has five gates and numerous loop-holed towers flanking the wall. Formerly Karmaushah boasted some handsome edifices, but these for the most part have gone to decay. Plowden (1881) gives the following list of public works completed by Muhammad 'AH Mirza and his son Imam-ud*Daulat, both of these being men of strong individual character, whose family influence enabled them to retain * The tuman is equal to about 10 shillings English.327 KAR-KAR office for a long series of years, and gave the province the advantage of a settled policy and continuous administration :— By Muhammad '’All Mxrza— (1) The Chahar Bagh in imitation of that of Isfahan.

By Imam-ud-Daulat— (1) The Arsenal in the city. (2) The Post-house. (3) The Telegraph Office. (4) The new bazar. (5) The Masjid at the Najaf gate. (6) The villa and garden of Imadiah. (7) The villa and reservoirs at Tak-i-Bustan. (8) Three caravansarais. (9) The artillery parade ground. Another public work which deserves mention is the bridge over the Kara-Su. It was built by Shaikh 7 Ali Khan, who ruled Karmanshah in the days of Shah Abbas. It has six arches, and is in excellent condition. The water of the Kara-Su is not used for irrigation; the banks are high, and the levels are not suitable. The Persians explain the matter differently; once, they say, the Kara-Su fertilised the whole country, but its waters were horror-stricken and shrunk from their banks when the madman Yazd-i-gird cast the Prophet's letter contemptuously into the stream, which, has ever since remained accursed and useless. The city of Karmanshah contains about 60,000 inhabitants,* all of them, with the exception of about 300 Jews, Muhammadans of the Shiah faith. The plain on which the city stands extends 6 miles in breadth from north to south and 30 miles from east to west, and is studded with small villages containing from 30 to 50 houses. To the north the plain is shut in by the Parau range of mountains, which terminates abruptly at the village of Bihistan*, distant about 20 miles from Karmanshah. The situation of the city is picturesque and well chosen. There is an ample supply of water, which however has the defect of hardness; the soil is fertile, and supplies of all kinds are plentiful and cheap. The province of Karmanshah counts some of the leading Kajar Princes among its former rulers. They remitted very little, if any, money to Tihran, but spent the whole revenue of the province on themselves, on the provincial forces, and on local public improvements. These last were many of them—like the Ima diah palace and gardens—for purely selfish objects, but it was something that the money collected in the province should be also expended in it. Now-a-days every tuman that can be spared after provision for the barest necessaries has been made is remitted to the Imperial Treasury at Tihran. Expenditure on local improvements has entirely ceased. No Governor * 30,000, Parliamentary Report, Dickson, 1885.828 KAR—KAR takes any interest in sucli matters: he does not even keep in repair the work of those who have gone before him. It is not worth his while to do so. He has probably paid a large sum in pishkash ” for his appointment, from which he may be removed on the shortest notice. During the last 16 months the Governor has been changed six times. The law of self-preservation is after all supreme; consequently, it is not surprising that the first object which a new Governor seeks to accomplish, is to recoup himself for his original outlay ; his second to make a purse for the future. This summer Karmanshah was added to the already numerous provinces under the authority of the Zil-u- Sultan. His Royal Highness* jurisdiction at the present moment includes over one-third of the whole of Persia, and is separated by only one district—Persian Kurdistan—from the territory under his younger brother, the Vali-ahd. The Zil-us-Sultan has appointed Abdulla Mlrza, on whom the title of Hishmat-u-Daula has just been conferred, as his Naib at Karmanshah, and it will be interesting to watch the future of that province under its new auspices. Kinneir describes Karmanshah as a flourishing town, containing about 12,000 houses, but oppression and misgovernment have since had their fruit; three-fourths of the population have emigrated, the towns people to Azarbaijan, nomads to Turkey, and the town is now a mere heap of ruins; the bazars but partially filled and with scarcely any trade, except in fruits. In the time of Muhammad *Ali Mirza, Kar manshah had a population of 35,000 souls, but after his death it decreased to 12,000. The inhabitants are chiefly Shiah Mussalmans. Thomson in 1868 estimated the number at . 30,000 Rozario „ 1872 „ „ „ ,, • 25,000 among whom, he says, were Jews, Armenians, Turks, Persians, Kurdis- tanis, and a few Hindus. Floyer in 1876 put the number at . . 40,000 T. C. Plowden „ 1881 „ „ »&gt; » • • 60,000 The last-named says also that, of the above number, all are Shiah Mussalmans, except 300 Jews, and that there is a garrison in the city of one regiment of regular infantry and 200 artillery men. From this it would seem that the population is increasing. Fifty years ago (1830) Karmanshah was attacked by plague, which did not finally disappear for eight years. During this period 50,000 are said to have died from the disease. About the year 1863 cholera appeared for the first time, and subsequently visited the city annually for eight years; on three occasions the epidemic was very severe. The town now has a mean appearance, from the approaches to it, though some of the houses are three storeys high, and were it not for the lofty turrets that flank the “ Andarun,” or “women's apartments ” of the palace, it would fail to strike the eye. Almost concealed in the uneven ridges of some undulating hills (the Kamar-zard) that bound it on the south face, it is reputed hot .and at times unhealthy. The gardens are, however, pretty and contain some fine fruit-trees. The slim and lofty poplar flourishes here in perfection, but is seldom allowed to attain to maturity,KAR—KAR 329 Internally the town presents a picture of ruin similar to most eastern towns. The palace walls are surrounded by untenanted hovels, and decay presents itself whichever way the eye of the spectator turns. Its bazars are but partially filled, and, with the exception of fruits which are abundant, offer but little proof of commercial enterprise. Karman- shah was celebrated for the richness and beauty of its carpets, but scarcely one is now obtainable. Industry, indeed, is at present un known on the spot where thousands of busy fingers were daily occupied in weaving those beautiful and justly famed specimens of Persian workmanship. The causes of this lamentable decline of the trade and the arts are owing to the rapacity of its successive Governors and to plague and cholera. The better sorts of piece-goods and other Euro pean manufacture find their way here from Tabriz, and the refuse of the Baghdad markets is also imported by the poorer dealers when the bazars of that city are ever overstocked. Tabriz is, however, the chief place whence its imports are derived. The town was formerly girt by a strong wall that now exposes large gaps, through which a squadron of horse might traverse the whole range of its streets, rendering the gates of the city a dead letter and merely used from habit alone. Karmanshah is governed by a Prince of the blood, and has an arsenal. It is a position of considerable strategic importance, being nearly equidistant from Tabriz, Anzali on the Caspian, Tihran, Isfahan, and Baghdad. It was recommended by Sir H. Rawlinson during the Persian war of 1856 that this place should be the main depot in the event of the advance of a British force against Tihran from Baghdad.

Long. &gt; Elev. A river of Khuzistan, Persia. Its principal sources are at a place called Korreng in the mountains of Zardah Kuh. The springs are mostKAR—KAR 330 abundant, and from its source tbe Karun is a large river. After forc ing its way through lofty mountains by precipitous and narrow gorges, and receiving numerous small streams from the valleys, it is joined by its first principal tributary, the Ab-i-Burs, which is almost equal in size to itself. A few miles above Susan after this junction, the Karim becomes a large and rapid river. Passing through a difficult ravine, it enters the valley of Susan. (It is here fordable in November, but only at one spot, and the ford a very difficult one.) Below Susan it forces its way through a most precipitous gorge, breaking with great violence over innumerable rocks, which have been precipitated by the mountain torrents into the bed of the river. Here there are the remains of a magnificent bridge, the buttresses of massive brick-work, apparently of the Kayanian epoch. They rise to a considerable height from the foaming torrent, and have defied its impetuosity for ao-e's. Even rafts cannot be floated through this narrow and danger ous passage. The Karun continues to wind between lofty mountains, overhano-ing the valley of Susan Sohrab and the plain of Andaku, until it°emerges into the plain of Akili by a narrow gorge; it here receives several tributary streams, the principal of which are the Talak and the Ab-i-Shor, which enter it above Loll. The river now quits the mountains, and is here a broad and tranquil stream, and would be fit for navigation, if not blocked by the dam of Shustar. Here numer ous canals and watercourses for irrigation have been drawn from it. The length of its course through the plains is 10 miles: it is joined by the large salt stream of Baitavand, and shortly afterwards forces its way through the gorge of Kuh-i-I adalak, a part of the range of lower limestone and sandstone hills parallel to the great range. The cliffs rise on both sides perpendicularly from the river, and a road has, with much labour, been excavated on the left bank. Immediately above the town of Shustar, the Karun is divided into two branches; that to the north is the original channel of the river; that to the south is the celebrated Nahr-i-Masrukan, or the artificial canal now called the Ab-i-Gargar. The ancient bed of the river flows to the west of the town of Shustar, and shortly after leaving it, a small canal has been cut which connects it with the Ab-i-Gargar below, as well as above. It is fordable in all parts of its course, except during its passage round the town, being seldom above 3 feet in_ depth and not capable of being rendered deeper. It unites, with the Ab-i-Gargar at Baud-i-Kir, 30 miles_below Shustar. At the point of separation of the old river from the Ab-i-Gargar, a dam has been thrown across its entrance, narrow openings being left for the passage of the water. Beyond this dam the canal flows between very lofty cliffs of sandstone. Half a mile below the dam is a second, built almost to the level of the cliffs on both sides, forming a complete stoppage to the water, which, escaping through numerous passages cut literally through the rock, falls in cataracts into the bed beneath. The level of the canal bed below this dam is considerably lower than above it ; a bridge is thus formed between Shustar and the village of Boleiti, and is called the Pul Boleiti. Beyond this the Ab-i-Gargar flows into a broad deep stream, the depth being 12 to 18 feet in the lowest season, and the331 breadth varying from 60 to 120 yards, between steep and lofty banks, till its junction with the Karun at Band-i-Kir. From Shustar to Hasanabad the current runs at the rate of about 5 miles an hour ; below that it is not more than 2 miles. About 5 miles below Shustar the Ab-i-Gargar is nearly traversed by a dam called Mahlbazan, which is partly natural and partly artificial, and prevents the ascent of vessels to the town. Below this dam is the village of Hasanabad, where boats employed in the trade between Shustar, Ahwaz, and Muhammarah usually unload. The entire course of this canal may be about 86 miles. The Karun is also joined at Band-i-Klr by the river of Dizful, a large stream, and after the union of these three streams the Karun becomes a noble river, exceeding in size the Tigris or the Euphrates. Its banks are well wooded, its depth is considerable, its current equal and moderate, and it is, in fact, a river admirably suited to steam or other navigation. A low range of sandstone hills traverses the Karun at Ahwaz (g.v.), 40 miles below Band-i-Klr. It is evident that the river has forced a passage through them, and the rocks which remain on its bed form the only obstruction in its course from near Shustar to the sea. Four ridges of rock cross the Karun at Ahwaz; the first, immediately above the castle and below a large island in the river, has an opening which admits of vessels without any difficulty, and has 9 fathoms of water, and is of considerable breadth. Through it Lieutenant Selby took the steamer Assyria, and the inhabitants of Ahwaz constantly take large vessels by the same passage. The second channel, which is nearly in the centre of the river, is considerably smaller, but has about the same depth of soundings. This ridge of rocks has been taken advantage of in constructing a dam across the river, and the interstices are filled up with massive masonry, much of which now remains; this is the celebrated Band-i-Ahwaz {q.v.). The third ridge, not travers ing the river, offers no obstacle to the ascent of vessels. The fourth ridge is of the same description. The river at Ahwaz is between 5 and ^ mile in breadth, and has a continuous channel of above 8 feet deep in the driest part of the year. A little way below Ahwaz are the remains of a channel, by which the waters of the Shahpur river are said to have entered the Karun. Seventeen miles below Ahwaz by the river the Karun still receives during the floods a contribution from the Karkhah through a canal called Shatt-ul-Maktu’a. From Ahwaz the river runs south-south-east to Kot Abdula, and as far as that place it winds very little, but beyond it is very serpentine in its windings as far as Ismailiah, 46 miles below Ahwaz : thence it runs past Idrisiah 7 miles, Imam All Husain 8 miles, Bubendru (?) Yakub 10 miles, and thence south-east 12 miles to the Hafar, and, flowing through an alluvial soil, is subject to much variation in its bed, but a continuous channel may be found at all times of not less than 2 fathoms in depth. Its banks, from about 35 miles above Muhammarah, are well wooded, and it is in every respect admirably adapted for steam naviga tion. From the Karun below Shustar to the Bahr-ul-Mashir numerous canals and watercourses have been drawn. The Karun discharges itself into the sea by the Khur Bahmahir and part of its waters332 KAR-KAR into the Shatt-ul-Arab by an artificial canal called the Hafar. Such are at present the only outlets of this river. The Bahr-ul-Mashir is about 40 miles in length, and has a good navigable channel to its junction with the sea, of not less than 9 feet at low water, being above half a mile in width. Its general course is south-south-east. Its entrance is at low water during spring tides more than 3 fathoms deep, and, therefore, practicable for ships of large burden. Its hanks are hut little inhabited, as its water, being often mixed with the tides from the Persian Gulf, is generally salt. The canal from the Karun to the Shatt-ul-Arab, now generally called the Hafar, is about 3f miles in length, 200 to 400 yards in breadth, and a depth varying from 30 or 40 feet of water, and receives probably about three-fifths of the waters of the river. It has evidently, since the time of its construc tion, increased considerably, in size, and must, from the nature of the soil and from the force with which the tide enters the Bahr-ul-Mashir operating as a check upon the free discharge of the waters of the river by that mouth, be daily enlarged. There is depth of water in this canal for vessels of any burden. On it is situated the town of Mu- hammarah. Its banks, like those of the Shatt-ul-Arab, are clothed with palm-groves. The tide ascends in the Karun for a few miles above Rubain(?)ibn-Yakub. The difference in temperature between the Shatt-ul-Arab and the Karun is very remarkable, Lieutenant Selby having found the former in the month of August to be 96°, while the latter, not 200 yards distant, was under 80°. The Karun is perfectly easy of navigation at all seasons for vessels drawing 4 feet of water, and admirably adapted for steam communication from the sea to within 6 miles from Shustar. Both banks of the river are abundantly wooded, and fuel could conse quently be found anywhere, but the places which seem best suited for fuel stations, from their being the constant locality of Arabs, appear to be Kala Idrisiah, 18 hours' steaming above Muhammarah ; Ahwaz, 16 hours above Idrisiah; BandakI, 10 hours above Ahw r az; thence to Shustar is only 8 hours. It is probable that if once arrangements were perfected, river steamers, such as are now made, could easily ascend to Shustar in two days, steaming from Muhammarah. {Kinneir — Chesney — Layard—Selby — Rawlinson.) Extract from Report by P. Robertson (1S76). “ Half an hour after leaving Fellahlah we came to the entrance to the Karun. This mouth is called the Hafar. It is said to have been originally a canal dug to connect the Karun with the Euphrates. However this may be, it is now the main stream, about three-fourths of the water of the Karun passing by it into the Shatt-ul-Arab, while a fourth goes to the Persian Gulf by the other mouth called the Bahr- ul-Mashir. The town of Muhammarah stands on the north bank of the Hafar, half a mile up it. A mile above Muhammarah the Karun divides, part of its waters going by the Hafar, and part by the Bahr-ul-Mashir. The Hafar has a uniform depth of 30 feet, its breadth being about 250 yards.333 “ The Bahr-ul-Mashir is not navigable in certain places at low water for vessels drawing more than 7 feet of water, and is little used for traffic. It appears to be getting shallower year by year, while the volume of water passing through the Hafar increases. The rise and fall of the tide in the Bahr-ul-Mashir being about 9 feet, most vessels could, by taking advantage of high water to get over the shallow part, reach Muhammarah by it. ‘‘ Passing up the Karun, we arrived at sunset at the village of Kasbah, about 8 miles above Muhammarah. Date groves end; and for the next 20 miles the soil is impregnated with saltpetre, and sparsely covered with low bushes. A couple of miles above Kasbah, on the eastern side of the river is the Shakha (?) or Dorak canal, which con nects the rivers Karun and Jarahi: it is now so filled with sand as to be navigable by such boats only as can be occasionally dragged over the mud. “ From this to Ahwaz the navigation of the river presents no difficulty, beyond a strong stream in the winter and spring, and a minimum depth of 3 feet of water opposite the deserted village of Ismaili in autumn. From the tomb of ■’Ali-ibn-el-Husain upwards, the banks are wooded with poplar and tamarisk. Ruined villages occur frequently, but, with the exception of 'Amairi, 9 miles from Ahwaz, none are now inhabited. Reached 'Amairi on the 4th, and Ahwaz on the 5th April (about 200 inhabitants at each place). “ Here, i.e. } at Ahwaz (q.v.), the river passes at right angles through a range of low sandstone hills, and four ledges of sandstone cross its bed more or less completely. “ On one of these are the ruins of an artificial dam of masonry, which constitutes the only impediment to a steamer’s ascending the Karun to within 5 miles of Shustar. In its present condition the dam is clearly impassable, except perhaps at great risk for a few weeks in the spring ; but there are so many ways of overcoming the difficulty that it hardly constitutes one. “ To cut a channel through the soft sand on which the dam is built in the,autumn, when the river is low, would be easy; but it is feared that if a free passage were allowed to the water, the river above Ahwaz might become inconveniently shallow. A canal, with a lock, might be made at little cost. “ Left Ahwaz on the 5th, and arrived at Wais on the 7th. Here ends the jurisdiction of HajI Jabar Khan. “ At sunset on the 7th reached Band-i-Kir, where the two branches of the Karun (which separate at Shustar) and the river Diz come together. I proceeded on by the easterly branch of the friver. This branch was originally a canal, dug to irrigate the adjacent country. “ We progressed slowly by dragging the boats from branch to branch of the trees, where other modes of proceeding were impractic able.^ The water system of Shustar was long a matter of doubt. Sir Henry Rawlinson was probably the first to explain it correctly. Schindler also made important observations on the subject.334 KAR—KAR Ardashlr Babakan is said to have built the first dam across the river so as to raise the water and get it up to the level of the town. He also cut the Darian canal, which led the water into the town and into the fields beyond. The dam then got destroyed and Shustar was without water until the workmen sent for by Valerian renewed it. Thus far Persian tradition. Ardashir Babakan having built a dam at Shustar seems improbable on account of his short reign and his wars with the Askanians, which would hardly have given him time. But the canal, as its name indicates, may have been one of the works of Darius. The river running west of the town, and having its bed in soft alluvial soil, probably got lower and lower every day, till at last not filling the Darian canal, it left the town and its southern fields dry. The Persian workmen then got the Romans to help them. A deep canal was dug on the east side of the town, and the river was diverted from the west to the east, following the incline of the alluvial plain; this new river or canal, the present Gargar, was cut towards the old river at the present Band-i-Kir [q.v.) The old river was then entirely emptied by constructing a temporary dam across it just at the fork where the new river had been cut. The bed of the old river was then raised several yards, but to prevent any washing away of the soil, and a consequent fall of the river, the whole bed was paved with huge stones, well jointed by lead. This pavement is called Shadurvau. A dam was then also built across the new river so as to raise the water on to the Shadurvan; the temporary dam was re moved, and the water, or part of it, returned to its old bed, forming, as at the present day, a waterfall when it gets to the end of the paved way. The Darian canal became also filled, and the town and country lying south of it were well watered. Later on the flow of water was regulated by dykes, or small tunnel-like openings in the dam on the new river in such a manner that two-thirds of the waters flowed east and four-thirds west of the town. This gave rise to the appellations Do Dank and Chahar Dank. The Gargar dam occasionally got damaged, and once, in the latter part of the last century, nearly all the water rushed through the Gargar canal, and the Dariau became empty; the dam was then reconstructed. The present bridge over the Gargar, built on the dam, is a modern construction. The bridge over the Shatait, partly destroyed in 1832 and repaired by Muhammad 'AH Mirza some years later, is built on the foundations of the old bridge. The very old bridge was destroyed by Hajaj-ibn-Yusuf during the reign of Malik-ibn-Marvan (684-705). The last dam on the Karun was one constructed of turf by the Chab Arabs at Mand, some 8 miles above where Muhammarah now stands. It turned the Karun bodily towards the Choahan, then the capital of the Chab nation, and the country through which it passed irrigated by innumerable small canals, whose remains are still to be seen, produced abundance of sugar, cotton, indigo, sesame, dates, wheat, rice, &amp;c., which were largely exported. \\ hen the Chab Arabs underwent the usual process of internal dissension, intrigue with Turkey and Persia, and decay towards the end of the last century, the dam was allowed to fall to ruin, and the Karun taking its present course, the Choahan became the parched desert it now is, and had to be abandoned altogether.0-&gt;T\ 335 KAR—KAR As regards the navigability of the Kamn, almost all the best autho rities are agreed as to the suitability of the river for navigation by steamers of light draught from Muhammarah to Shustar, and the practicable nature of the scheme as regards this particular point. As has been pointed out, there is only one part of the river at Ahwaz where at present there is a break. From Ahwaz to Shustar there is no difficulty. In December 1881 Captain Wells visited Ahwaz and care fully examined the obstruction. At Band-i-kir the three streams, the Diz, the Karun, and the Ab-i-Gargar meet. Owing to the nature of the country, and the great difference of level between the river beds above and below the rapids, Captain Wells was of opinion that to open a pas sage, blasting would probably do more harm than good, and he considers that the best plan to follow would be to dig a canal from the point A in the accompanying map to the pool above Ahwaz marked B, follow ing the line on the map. The river is said to fall 8 or 10 feet between these two points. It would, no doubt, be easy enough to blow out pas sages in the four ridges of sandstone which constitute the obstruction, but it is impossible to predict what effect thus letting loose the pent up water of the Upper Karun would have on the whole bed of the river. As regards the canal scheme by Captain Wells, two locks would be required, viz., one at A and one at B, and, no doubt, sandstone would be met with for the greater part of the length (2,350 yards), yet the work once executed, these same sandstone walls to the canal would be of the greatest benefit, and would never be a cause of expense like the banks of most navigable waterways. There would probably never be more than 35 feet of excavation required, even if the canal were to be 8 feet deep. Mr. Baring thinks that the Karun should be used as a trade route, by means of two exits of steamers, one above and one below Ahwaz. These two sections should be connected by a tramway. The object, of course, of this opening up of the Karun is to give Persia what she urgently needs, an easy highway from some of the richest but most inaccessible provinces. Karmanshah, Dizful, Shustar, and Bihbaban, and even Azarbaijan would undoubtedly avail themselves freely of this outlet now so neglected, and yet wanting so little to render it practicable. Sir H. Rawlinson considered the scheme a delu sion and snare.” First, because he considered the obstacle insur mountable, and, secondly, on account of the difficulties of the roads leading from the Karun to the interior, partly on account of natural obstacles, and partly owing to the lawless and insecure state of the country through which they would pass. It has been shown how Captain Wells proposed to meet the first, and Mr. Thomson calls attention to two routes from Dizful to Khuramabad which were un known to Sir H. Rawlinson, while they had recently been explored by Mr. Schindler, who found that one of them had long been used by the Persians for the transport of their artillery. Mr. Thomson also shows that the state of the country has quite altered since Sir H. Rawlinson's time, and that a well-frequented trade route would be quite secure. The opening of the Karun for navigation would be336 KAR—KAU equally advantageous to England from a political and from a commer cial point of view. Considering the political aspect of the case, it may be remarked that it would give England, as the country which would most largely employ the new route, paramount influence in Southern Persia, while the possibility of bringing troops within a few hundred miles of the most important towns would naturally contribute largely to the re-establishment of British influence at Tihran. From a commercial point of view it would appear that the only chance of successful competition with Russian trade is the opening up of the Karun. Twenty years ago British merchants almost monopo lised the trade of Persia; at this moment English goods are rarely seen beyond Isfahan and even at this place Russian produce is sold in equal quantity with British merchandise. This change is due to the development of steam navigation on the Caspian and the construction of good roads from the Caspian to Tih ran and Mashhad. If nothing is done towards developing communi cations with the Persian Gulf, British trade will be driven out of all the wealthy parts of Persia. The importance to British interests of opening up the Karun by British means is enhanced by the presence and designs of the French, whose design is to construct a dam at Ahwaz and to irrigate and cultivate the adjacent lands by a French Company. This scheme of a dam at Ahwaz, which was once on the point of being conceded by the Shah, is incompatible with the English one of opening up the naviga tion of the river. It is sufficiently obvious what considerations in duce Russia to encourage French designs. The proposal to open the navigation of the Karun originated entirely from a firm of British merchants who were supported by the Government on account of the obvious advantages to British commerce. Hitherto, however, the SkalFs Government have declined to assist in any way, or even to allow foreign steam vessels to run on the Karun river. The Shah's first peremptory refusal was dated February 1879. In 1881 the Zil-us-Sultan, who had been appointed Governor of Fars did his best for the scheme, but the Shah's opposition was not to be overcome, and, finally, in February 1883 negotiations on the subject with the Shah's Government ceased, and it was thought advisable to leave the matter in abeyance. (Chamjoain — Ross — Robertson — Wells — Thomson.) KARUN— The following notes are extracted from Lieutenant-Colonel Bell's “South-West Persia,' 1884— “ Many opinions have been given upon the practicability of opening up the navigation of the Kaiun river, some favourable, others un favourable, all of which will be found fully recorded in the Karun River Precis, 1879-83 (Indian Foreign Department, Confidential Paper). From viewing the river in March and April 1884, Major Bell concluded that its navigation would be feasible at all seasons for fiat-bottomed boats of a burden up to 50 tons provided with expansive sails similar to those navigating the Indus at Sukkur, and for flat-337 22 KAR—KAR bottomed steamers drawing 3 feet to 4 feet, similar to those navigat ing the Tigris to Baghdad, of 400 tons burden and 100 horse-power. The boats navigating the Karun vary in burden from 5 to 70 tons ; in form they are wedge-shaped with a raking prow, flat bottoms, and a p raised open poop for the accommodation of the crew. The mast, placed somewhat forward, leans considerably to the front, and carries one expansive latine sail. A boat, 90 feet long, 20 feet wide, carries 70 tons and draws 7 feet 3 inches. The steamer Karun, in the possession of Shaikh Mizal, is of 120 tons, and draws about 3 feet. It has done the journey from Mnham- marah to Ahwaz, travelling all night, in 23 hours, in charge of her Arab captain. It may therefore be assumed that, allowing 5 hours for detention at Ahwaz for the steamer to pass through the canal, or for the transhipment of cargo, and 12 hours for the passage between Ahwaz and Shustar, a steamer from Muhammarah, when the current is not at its swiftest (June to December), could reach the latter place in 40 hours, or, say, 2 days. That there is little or no traffic on the river is due to Shustar and v&gt; Dizful being cut off from communication with the large towns of the north by the Lurs refusing to allow caravans to pass between the latter place and Khuramabad. The Zil-us-Sultan, the ruler of Luris- tan, is quite able, by the exercise of his legitimate power, to bring the few rebellious tribes, through whose pastures the road passes, to reason, and to render it perfectly secure. Were this done, a canal with locks constructed at Ahwaz, and stimulus given to the boat traffic which has fallen out of use, much might be done towards the revival of trade along this route, even without the introduction of a single steamer, upon the waters of the Karun. Were trade revived, Shustar and Dizful, once important commercial centres, but now un important towns, would regain their * former importance, and with it would of necessity follow the improvement of the mule roads between Shustar and Isfahan, Khuramabad and Gulpaigan, as well as hAli- Gudar and Akhora-Bala. Beyond the construction, in the first . instance, of roads fit for laden mules and mule litters through the hills, nothing is required ; such roads would cost little, but it is ques tionable whether the Persians themselves can construct them, as they have no proper hill road-making tools, and are almost ignorant of blasting. Nor would the opening of the Karun be viewed with in difference by the Shaikh of Muhammarah, if what was reported be true; it would increase his wealth, but it would at the same time draw down upon him the cupidity of his Persian masters, and eventually lead to his fall; and he is said not to favour the idea much as he leans f towards the British. Mr. Mackenzie is of opinion that steam vessels towing rafts could make the ascent to Ahwaz in 50 hours and the descent in 20. The steam launch of Shaikh Mizal made the ascent in five days and the descent in 12 hours in April 1884. * The fact of the Atahegs of Luristan having in the 13th century constructed a good road across the Bakhtiari hills to Isfahan, adds force to this conjecture, and doubtless the decay of the road was coeval with the decadence of Shustar and Dizful as commercial centres. Remains of extensive cities at Band-i-Kir, Ahwaz, also point to the ancient com mercial value of the Karuu river.338 KAR—KAR The whole question of the advantage of opening the Karuu to navi gation depends wholly on the security of the road between Dizful and Khuramabad, for the road itself, even unimproved, is better than any other of the kafila roads leading to the central plateau or Jreisia between Bushahr and Muhammarah. . That the river is capable of being navigated in the early spring by steamers is shown by the following notes abstracted from Yol. XIV of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society :— “ N.B .—It should be noted that the firewood which grew so plentifully along the hanks of the rivers Kftrun, Dizful, and Gargar in 1842 had almost disappeared m 1884. Lieutenant Selby, who carefully explored in 1842 both the branches of the Kama as far as Shustar and the Ab-i-Dizful to within a few miles of it, considers them to be well suited to navigation an opinion in which most travellers have since concurred. . These are the high roads into the very heart of Persia, and the civilisation of the country demands that theyshould be opened up to traffic. The country they traverse is healthy and fertile ; friendly tribes inhabit it. All considerations point to theip as a means whereby our political and commercial interests may be increased. The seasons during which rain falls, followed by that of the melting of the snow, i&gt;e. y from December to June, are the months duiing which the waters of the Karun and its affluents are at the highest; theii use and fall is irregular. In 1842 the highest rise was in February, and equalled 12 feet. They are not fordable between the sea and Shustar. The Assyria took 5 days to reach Shustar from Afuhammaiah by the main river, including delays in cutting wood* and a detention of 10 hours. She anchored every evening. The navigation presented no difficulties. By the Ab-i-Gargar, and after the establishment of fuel depots. Lieutenant Selby was of opinion that the Assyria could have reached Shustar in 2| days. The fittest stations above Muhammarah are— Kal’a Idrisiyah, left bank 18 Ahwaz, left bank . . . • • • • .16 Band-i-Kir, right hank ...•••• Shustar, by main river ...•••• 10 „ by Ab-i-Gargar 8 In February 1842, at a time when the Karun was in flood, and had overflowed the surrounding country to a considerable extent, the steamer Assyria, 100 feet long, ascended to Ahwaz in 30 hours. When the water is high, the shoals at Rubain-ibn-Yakub and Ismailiyah, the chief obstructions in its course, offer no difficulties. The two lower bands at Ahwaz were crossed, and the third or principal band was passed, by aid of a hawser, towards the right bank, by the opening there, 40 yards broad, through which the stream rushed with a velocity of between 5 and 6 miles an hour, the river at the time being at its ordinary spring level. The fourth band * In 1884 Major Bell saw no nearer approach to wood than the tamarisk bush, a very poor fuel for heating the boilers of a steamer. Naphtha can be obtained from the hills to the north-east between Shustar and Kam-Hurmuz and near the Kuh-Asmaii.389 22 a KAR—KAR was 8 feet or 9 feet under water, and was easily passed. In the preceding June, when the stream was comparatively low, the Assyria had reached Ahwaz with much greater ease. Between Ahwaz and the natural band, 7 miles below Shustar, the river offered no difficulties ^ to the passage of * the Assyria ; the lowest water met with was 4 feet; its current was 3 miles an hour. The river has here worked a bed^ through which it rushes with violence, not sufficient, however, to prevent the passage of a steamer, which at this time of the year could ascend to Valerian's bridge. This branch, the Ab-i-Shateit, is more rapid, shallow, and winding than the Ab-i-Gargar. Its banks are fringed with stout poplars, and are well covered with grass in April. The soil is a rich alluvium. The Ab-i-Gargar carried generally 3 fathoms (February), and was ascended by the Assyria to the Mahi-Bazan Band. Its current was sluggish. It carries 12 feet at the lowest season. Its average width is 60 to 120 yards. Nearing Shustar, its current increases to 5 miles an hour. Its former bed was considerably higher than its present one; it falls suddenly at Shustar about 20 feet. The present depth of its bed and width of its channel in places is due to the Band-i-Mizan having given way, and the major portion of the waters of the Karun having forced their way down it—a natural occurrence if the relative positions of its proper bed and Ab-i-Gargar be considered. The Assyria stopped only one mile short of Shustar, where a natural ledge of rocks bars the river, and through which there is an opening, 10 yards wide, affording a passage to boats of 20 tons burden; wood abounded along the banks. In October 1876 Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, then Officiating Political Resident, Persian Gulf, went 50 miles up the Karun river in the steam launch of HajI Jabir Khan, Governor of Muhammarah. The river appeared to him shallow in proportion to its breadth, and the steam launch, which drew 3 feet of water, several times bumped on sand-banks. He doubted whether the river could be navigable, at any season, for any vessel, unless of very light draft. His impres sion, which was based on the information he received, as well as on actual observation, was that the river was but ill-adapted for a commercial highway. In October the river is at its lowest. Hutting troops along the banks of the Kanin during the summer months can be carried out without danger; by surrounding the huts with camel-thorn screens, to be kept constantly wet, so as to produce evaporation, the temperature can be reduced to quite a bearable point, y i.e., 80° to 90°.

When Rawlinson visited it in February, the stream, though very rapid, was not more than 3 feet deep. {Rawlinson!)

KASHKAI— , p t n One of the four clans of the Jaf Kurds who are found on both sides ot the frontier on the Diala river. {Gerard.) kashkAi— r ^ v ^ , A collection of tribes of the province of Fars, who are united under the rule of one chief. They number 15,000 households, 3,000 of which are of the family of the Khan. They have about 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 infantry. They are said to be descendants of a race trans planted by Hulaku from Kashgar. The wealth of this tribe is in sheep and goats, horned cattle, horses and asses, but they possess few camels. The wool of the sheep and goats is all required for the use of the tribe,341 KAS—KAS who work it up into articles of clothing, camp equipage, horse cover ings, and carpets. A small portion of it is of a fine white, but perhaps half that produced by the sheep is of a dirty white. The goats are chiefly black and red. Some of their sheep are of remarkable size, weighing frequently from 130 to 144 lbs. The Kashkai are of Turk origin, and are scattered pretty well over the whole of Ears, wintering in the lowland and spending the summer in the elevated tracks between Shiraz and Isfahan. The following list is given by Lieutenant Mclvor of the clans or divisions of Kash- kais in his notes on mule-breeding in Persia :—■ “ 1, Kash Kull, 2, Darasliiili,, 3, Shash Buluki, 4, Farsi Madan, 5, Kuruni, 6, Karachai and Dad&amp;gai, 7, Bahlmi, 8, Kur-i-Shuli, 9, Sefi Khani, 10, Urd-i-Shlri, 11, Jafar Begi, 12, Gallazan, 13, Igdar, 14, Imam Kuli Khan, 15, Darab Khani, 16, Amala-i-Ilkhani, 17, ’AH Knll Khani, 18, Bahadur Khani, 19, Kubad Khani {q.v. for particulars, i.e., feudal chiefs, localities, numbers of families, mules, etc.) The total number of mules in their possession is reckoned at 3,200, and some clans keep herds of mares for the especial purpose of breed ing. Stack describes an encampment he met with belonging to the Nafar tribe of Kashkais, whose flocks graze in the hilly region south east of Eiruzabad during the early spring. The tents consisted of black blankets stretched over four sticks. The Persian word for these encampments is atsMm. In 1882 the Ilkhani Sultan Muhammad Khan and Haji Nasrulab Khan Sartip, Ilbegi, were appointed to the superintendence of the Kashkai Illyats. The name of this tribe, Kashkai, means “profugi” from the Turki Kdchmak “ to flee/' The ancestors of the tribe took refuge in Persia centuries ago. {Pell//—Abbott — Ross — Mclvor—Stack.) Bell, 1885, gives the following description of this tribe :— “ The Kashgai or Kashkai, Turkish Illyats, are considered to be of the Lur famify, and in manners, customs, features, &amp;c., resemble the Bakhtiarls and the Kuhgehlu, whose territory they border to the east. Their pastures reach to the neighbourhood of Shiraz, Persepolis, Yazdikhast, and Kumishah. “ The winter pastures of the Kashkai extend to the south and south east of Shiraz to Plruzabad and on the road to Lar. Like the other Lurs they commence their migrations thence soon after Nau-ruz (the spring equinox). , , .. “ The western Kashkai number some 8,000 households, some say 12,000, and could possibly equip for the field 3,000 to 4,000 men, of whom 1,500 could be mounted. The famine, prior to 1873, greatly diminished their numbers; their chief families are the Ader Bav, Chardlh, Chirlk and Lashul. They are ruled by an Ilkhani and Ilbegi; the office of the former is practically in abeyance. Living m the vicinity of Shiraz and the main Shlraz-Isfahan road, they are more under Persian control than any other of the Lur family, and in conse quence are heavily taxed, their lands being farmed out to that one of their chiefs who may happen to be the most unscrupulous, most exacting, and most ready in promises of enhanced revenue. ^ 1 he piesent Ilbegi is Darab Khan; he succeeded Haji Nasrullah Khan as Ilbegi,KAS—KAS who had himself succeeded 'All Kull Khan, These three families own the greater part of the Kashkai territory. 'All Kuli Khan, at one time semi-independent) was through the instrumentality of the. then Ilkhani, his relation, captured by treachery, and his possessions confiscated. “ Darab Khan is popular amongst the nomads and is considered a good administrator. To be such, a man must be energetic and himself visit his scattered following. The life of an Ilbegi who is practically, in the case of the Kashkai, the Ilkhani, is not one of repose, but rather of incessant labour, both physical and mental. “ The Kashkai are wealthier than the Bakhtiari.' Mr. Baring, of the Tihran Legation, considers that the Kashkai outnumber the Bakhtiaris. In all they number 25,000 to 30,000 families. Kashkai Khans, 1885. 1.

Their .sheep are also of a large size. The Bakhtiaris and Kuhgehlu ^ consider that the pasture of the Kashkai hills is superior to their own. Such, however, did not seem to be the case along the line passed over; to the south-east of Shiraz it may be otherwise. The Kashkai were noted for their breed of horses ; they now consider that they are inferior to those of the Bakhtiari hills. The horses now in the country are of a mixed blood ; the Arab stain is still perceptible, but the beauty of their rounded proportions has been lost. Ridden early and over a difficult country, and fed chiefly on fodder, they soon age. Although their appearance is jaded, they possess muscle and endurance. An average height is 14 hands, and price 100 to 150 rupees. A good horse will fetch 300 to 400 rupees. There are very few good Arab stallions now left in the country. The Gulf Arab, the cross between large Persian mares and Arab stallions, are free from vice and sure-footed; their heads are small; their barrels and chests large; their bodies short and compact; their hoofs are large and healthy; shoulders good; they are willing and full of bottom and spirit.

Long. Elev. (St. John.) A village of Ears, about 51 miles from Shiraz on the road to Lar, situated in a plain of the same name. The plain is level and studded with camel thorn, and has villages at long intervals. It is watered by the Kara Agach river, which enters the plain on western side by a gorge between theKuh Siakh, which guards the Shiraz plain on the west and the Kuh-i-Safldar. Here, from time immemorial, a stone dam has supplied water to the canal which irrigates the Kawar plain, the banks of the river being too high for purposes of irrigation. The southern part of the plain collects the drainage and produces rice. The greater part of the plain is uncultivated and desolate. The village Kavar is a large one, surrounded by orchards, and there is a small cluster of villages in its neighbourhood. About a mile south of the village, the river Kara Agacb, here called Kawar, is crossed by a stone bridge, 30 feet above the water, called Pul-i-Nau. There is a caravansarai here, and a few supplies of grain and slaughter cattle are procurable. (Jones — Durand — Stack.) KAZAWAK—Lat. Long. Elev.

KAZRAN—See Kazrun. KAZRfjN—Lat. 29° 37'. &lt; Long. 51°43'. Elev. 2,800'. A town in Ears, 70 miles west of Shiraz and 95 miles north of Bu- shahr. It is situated in a valley, 30 miles long and 7 or 8 broad, bounded on the north by a salt lake and fertilised by a number of rivulets of excellent water. The drainage of the valley flows into the salt lake mentioned. The town is divided into the upper and lower, and covers a considerable space. The buildings are of stone and mortar, and have an appearance of solidity and neatness which is want ing in mud habitations; they are also frequently stuccoed. Many of them are fortified, possessing parapets and loopholes for musketeers. Excepting in size, the place hardly deserves the name of a town, as it is, more properly speaking, a conjunction of two large villages, and possesses only about a hundred miserable-looking shops. The situation is the north-west side of a well-cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms, walnut, and orange and lemon trees, are nearly the only verdure it possesses. There is nothing of interest to be seen in the place. The climate is warmer than that of Shiraz, but not oppressively so, and the inhabitants boast that it is so fine that fruits of cold and hot climates (sardsir and garmsir) flourish side by side. Excellent opium isKAZ—KAZ 346 produced in the villages around, obtained from the white poppy. The price is about Rs. 7 per lb. The population is variously stated at 4,000 souls and 1,500 to 2,000 families. Stack in t 1881 estimated the number of inhabitants of Kazruu at 8,000. It suffered severely in the famine of 1879-80. The kanat on which the water-supply de pends dried up ; many people died and many more had to leave and seek work and food in Bushahr and Shiraz. The antiquities of the place are to be found on the green hills behind the town. They consist of some traces of an old fort, and an empty cistern, which supplied the fort with water. The people are proud of their orange garden, but the oranges are either sour or bitter. Great encouragement has re cently been given to the cultivation of the poppy here. The outturn of the year 1-879-80 was estimated at 1,500 Shah man, or 100 cases. The administration of the district was entrusted in 1882 to Haji Mirza Aga Khan, vakil, and his brother Fazl J Ali Khan. Provisions are abundant here, and the valley abounds in forage and is said to be very healthy except in the autumn months. Water is supplied princi pally from water-courses (Jcanats). It is noteworthy that Kazruu is the home of most of the muleteers of the Southern Persia Telegraph Station. Supplies ai'e here abundant, or readily obtained, and fuel, charcoal, and fire-wocd are also procurable. Warm felts, coarse carpets, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack-saddles for ditto, and an easy shoe for hill-marching, form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather-dressers, and tent-makers are to be found here and in the vicinity. Timber, called safidar, which is a white poplar and also plane and walnut trees, are procurable. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood, and powder might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the mountains to the north-east of the town, and is brought down for summer use. Numbers of mules and many good horses could be procured from the nomad tribes in the neighbourhood. The district of Kazrun pays a revenue of 25,000 tumans. The place is recommended as a suitable site for the depot of a force advancing against Shiraz from the sea-coast. (Kinneir — Monteith — Clerk — Abbott — St. John — Telly — Jones.) Col. Boss in the Persian Gulf Administration Report gives the following memorandum on cultivation in Kazrun :— “Cultivation in Kazrun is undertaken as follows :— Shatwi or Autumn Sowings. “ The land in Kazrun is private property. If the cultivation be un dertaken by the landowner himself, he has to provide seed for an area # . of one gao* of cultivation, viz., 1,000 lbs. wheat and 1,000 lbs. barley, and pay about 14 kirans for the labour of ploughing and sowing. He pays in kind 11 per cent, of the yield of his harvest to government and 20 per cent, to the reapers, who have to undertake all duties appertaining to the collection of the harvest and the carriage into the stores of the landlord. The landowner also pays 2 to 4 per cent, for threshing or treading the corn.KAZ—KAZ 347 &lt;&lt; Other than a landowner undertaking a cultivation has to pay to the landowner 9 per cent, in kind, from the outturn of his harvest as rent for one gao of ground, and 14 per cent, to government as tax. His other expenses are the same as above. &lt;( The agriculturists of Kazrun are of two classes, viz. } the rayat-i- padishah and the non-rayat, the former being always looked down upon by all classes and subjected by government to more oppression than the others. The rayat cultivator thus not only pays more taxes to government, but has to pay his taxes in cash, instead of in kind and at 30 per cent, above market-value. He is also obliged to give a certain quantity of straw to government officials whenever required. c( A rayat, when a landowner and cultivating his own grounds, has to pay 15^ per cent, on his harvest in cash at the above enhanced valu- atiom ^ - at p a y g a b 0 ut 60 kirans annually in cash to government. There is another class of rayats who are obliged to buy at 30 per cent, above market-value a certain portion of the produce received by govern ment as taxes. A wealthy rayat is entirely at the mercy ot the authori ties, a sum of about 1,000 kirans being annually levied from him. ^ “The value of one gao of land is from 100 khans to 600 kirans according to the locality. “To start a cultivation an expense of about 15 tumans is necessary. One ox valuing . Seeds „ Labour about Straw and cotton seeds . Sundries . 50 kirans. . 60 . 14 . 16 “One donkey is also maintained by a rayat when undertaking 4 or more gaos of cultivation. “About 2,000 lbs. of grain are sufficient for cultivating one gao of ground at Kazrun. “ In the case of saifi cultivation, no distinction is made by govern ment between a rayat and non-rayat. “ Saifi sowings are always undertaken by proprietors of water and agriculturists conjointly, the proprietor providing the water and the gTOund, and the agriculturists finding the seed, labour, implements, &amp;c. “ Should the waterowner, however, not be a landowner as well, any other landowner would be but too glad to permit his lands to be used for saifi cultivation gratis, inasmuch as the soil becomes enriched by manuring which the saifi cultivation necessitates. “The time taken up for saifi sowings is about 7 months, the following being cultivated : tobacco, watermelon, muskmelon, vege tables, cotton, sesame seeds, lentils, &amp;c., rice, giam. ^ “ A tax of 20 per cent, ad valorem on the outturn is levied by government, three-fifths of which is payable by the proprietor of the water and two-fifths by the cultivator, and the balance is equally divided between the proprietor and cultivator,a 4-8 u Rice and gram, however, form an exception, and are cultivated under the following conditions :— “ The agriculturist recoups himself for the quantity of seed supplied by him after harvest. He then goes equal shares with the water- owner, who alone pays government taxes as follows : if a rayat, he pays three-fifths of his share to government; if a non-rayat, he pays only half, the agriculturist paying no tax on his share. “ In all cases the government share of the produce is to he carried to government stores at the cultivator's expense. “The approximate value of the produce on the spot is— Wheat at 40 to 60 cents per 99 Kazrun maund. Barley „ 25 „ 30 99 99 99 Gram „ 50 „ 80 9* 99 99 99 Sesame „ 70 „ 100 99 99 99 99 Maithee., 15 „ 20 99 99 99 99 Dhall „ 15 „ 200 99 99 99 99 Cotton „ 2% „ 3 kiran s 99 99 99 Riee ,, 50 „ 80 cents 99 99 99 “ The expenses of a rayat cultivator in Kazrun, supposed to have one wife and two children, are 10 tumans per annum. “ The yield of wheat and barley is from ten to twelve-fold in a good year and three to four in a bad one. “ Rice in a bad year yields twenty-fold and in a very good year sixty-fold; cotton five-fold in a bad year and ten-fold in a good year. “ Irrigation in Kazrun is generally conducted by means of kanats, and the water thereof should in all cases be allowed free passage across grounds, even though not belonging to the proprietor of the kanats. “Should the proprietor of a kanat not wish to undertake any saifl cultivation, he would still be made liable by government to such taxes as may-be due by the cultivation. “ The land in Kazrun is sown every alternate year. The portions remaining fallow are ploughed. “ No taxes whatever are levied by government on gardens at Kazrun. “In the cultivation of the poppy at Kazrun, the proprietor provides the land, seed, and expenses of sowing; the cultivation is then made over to the rayat, who undertakes all the labour necessary for the tend ing of the crop till the season of collection, when the proprietor pays for the labour of incision, say one kiran per man per day. The out turn is then equally divided between the landowner and rayats. No taxes are levied by government on the cultivation of opium at Kazrun.' Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a Medical Report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country be tween Kumar Takhta and Kazrun :— “ Kazrun is the principal town of this district; it has probably a population of 5,000. The water-supply is excellent, being brought from the neighbouring hills by an aqueduct. On reaching the plain of Kumarij you at once feel that you are breathing a more bracing atmo sphere. This district, which extends to the foot of Kotal-i-Dukhtar, is midway in temperature, produce, and climate between the sea-coast and the table-lands of Persia; here palms and oranges grow side by side,349 KAZ—KAZ and vines are cultivated on the slopes of the neighbouring mountains. “ The climate is less enervating and drier, though in the spring and early summer heavy dews fall: the summer is, however, very trying to Europeans, especially during July and August, when hot winds blow every afternoon. Eor two months during the winter there is occasionally a slight frost at night, and the rainfall there is greater than in most parts of Persia. “ In the Kazrun district the principal diseases are intermittent fever, enlarged spleen, hepatitis, dyspepsia, costiveness, pertussis, smallpox, paralysis, gonorrhoea, syphilis, periostitis, disease of joints, together with thickening of neighbouring bones, necrosis, diseases of the eye, especially ophthalmia and opacities of cornea, cataract, and strumous diseases of children, and a few cases of stone in the bladder. Here one sees fewer blind people, and these are more often the result of small pox. Until 1876, diphtheria was, I believe, unknown in Persia ; early in that year a severe epidemic broke out in Kazrun, causing many deaths; shortly afterwards it reached Shiraz and quickly travelled north. In July of that year I saw several cases in Tihran; since that time I have not heard of any cases at Kazrun. A severe epidemic of small pox occurred in Kazrun in 1883 and was fatal to children, of whom about 200 died.—Probably it is never altogether absent.”378 KEL—KHA KELAK—Lat. Long. Elev.

Pelly thinks this the most suitable spot between Bush ah r and Shiraz for the cantonment of European troops, as it is some hundred feet higher than Shiraz, and the situation is open and well-watered. The small plain on whieh it is situated is mostly- cultivated and enclosed on every side by low hills. From 5,000 to 8,000 men might easily encamp on the plain and along the banks of the river, the bed of which is broad and full of jungle. Taylor mentions that in May there was ice at this place. For medical consi derations, see under “ Shiraz.” ( Clerk — Jones — Pelly — Taylor — St . John.)

KHAR AG (in St. John's map) and elsewhere— Lat. 29° 15' 2*. Long. 50° 18' 50'’'. Elev. of highest part 281'. An island in the Persian Gulf, situated off the coast of Ears, 30 miles north-west of Bushahr. It is about 4| miles long. It runs north and south, and its southern extremity is rocky and elevated, nearly 100 feet above the level of the sea, whilst its other extremity is low and sandy having the fort of Kharag on its north-east point. The rocky portion rises abruptly from the sea, and its summit is a tableland which has, on the greater part of its surface, a thin loamy soil cultivated in the rainy season. The sides of the ridges presented to the sea are broken in upon by several deep and broad fissures, extending in upon the tableland upwards of 300 to 400 yards, in whose hollows masses of stone are deposited, as if they had fallen there on the formation of the rents. The rock is composed of coralline sandstone and limestone, also plentifully mixed with fossil tulipora with an appearance of horizontal stratificates, but most commonly abounding with disintegrated particles of limestone and mica, occasion ally assuming a stratified formation with the strata of different colours. it becomes irregular and sloping, smaller mounds leading gradually down to the sandy plain. The soil formed by the disintegrated rock and the sand is tolerable, and might be cultivated if the slope was sufficiently extensive and regular. As it is, many of the ravines are gardens in which are fruit-trees and vegetables, while the clefts of the rock are planted and enclosed by circular stone walls, which cause many portions of the rock to look as if covered with ruins. The low part of the island possesses a sandy soil, mixed with particles of dis integrated rock, and capable, when irrigated, of producing crops. About 100 acres are thus employed by the inhabitants, and during the cold season upwards of 500 are cultivated; when the rains fall, the soil, though meagre, is capable of great improvement. The beach is of small breadth, and rises somewhat abruptly from the sea, whose bottom {Felly.) [N.B.—This is Kahviz in St. John’s map.] present only in huge tabular masses superimposed in a loose sandy basis. Limestone with an earthy appearance resembling chalk, and detached pieces of gypsum now and then occur, but no other geognostic forma tions are found. In the limestone numerous oyster, cockle, lamprey, and a variety of smaller shells are obtained—fossils coseval with the island's formation, which is Neptunian; and has by some convulsion of nature been raised from the bottom of the sea—at a period later than the primary formation of the continent. The tableland of the island is occasionally intersected by low ravines, and towards its north boundary is covered with coral rocks. Its sand is firm and intermixed with 382883 KHA—KHA calcareous particles by constant attrition formed into a variety of shapes, and dead shells without pebbles either calcareous or quartzy. The inhabitants of the island are degenerated Arabs, who live within the walls of the fort which enclose a much larger space than is now required, even though many gardens are attached to the houses. Their occupation principally consists in piloting vessels up the Shatt-ul-Arab to Basra and in fishing. They proceed to the banks of the Shatt-ul- Arab in the date season, and on their return cultivate the soil on Kharag and the neighbouring island of Korgo Kharagu (St. John's map) and Khargu (Persian Gulf Pilot). (?) The grains grown are maize, barley, and wheat ; brinjals, radishes, beans and gourds are abundant, but fruits are scarce. A few grapes and water-melons can only be procur ed at times on the island, while every variety of fruit and vege table, with other supplies, are easily and cheaply obtainable from Bushahr and Basra. The botanical productions of Kharag are the date tree, banyan {Ficus Indica), willow {Acacia Arabica), henna bush, cotton plant, tamarisk, jowasa, &amp;c., some of the common fruits of Persia, and occasionally on the rock a few aromatic shrubs. The wood on the island is insufficient to afford a supply of fuel, which is brought in small boats from the neighbouring islands. Bullocks and sheep are fed on the island, but with the exception of a few antelopes, no quadruped exists in a state of nature. Partridges and quails are occasionally seen. Turtles have been caught on the beach, and fish is plentiful. The water found on the island is abundant and of excellent quality; it is obtained either by digging wells 20 feet below the surface, or from long subterranean aqueducts which extend often from the centre or from one side of the rocky part of the island to the other. These underground channels were found by the Dutch, and were believed by them to be very ancient : they extend inwards often a mile in the solid rock, and holes, circular and square, are cut down upon them from 10 to 15 feet deep to admit fresh air and light, in order to permit the inhabitants to pass up and remove any accumulation likely to choke them and to raise the water. Their mouths are frequently in a low arched cavern formed by nature, and it is not until some distance inwards that they exhibit art as having been had recourse to for their formation. It is therefore most probable that the springs, having been discovered issuing from the rock by the first inhabitants of the island, were followed up to their sources to ensure a constant supply of water. Their courses are generally in a straight direction, and their beds run on a soft calcareous soil, the basis on which the coralline rock of the island is superincumbent, and which has been originally removed for the construction of these aqueducts; so that almost invariably the rock forms their roofs, down which places for the admission of air and light are cut. The stream from these springs is small, but constantly and generally terminates in a large pool outside the cavern in a ravine, whose hollow exhibits an abundance of natural vegetation, or is con verted into a garden by the natives. Captain Taylor, Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, however, writing in 1818, says, ^The quality of the water does not deserve the encomiums passed on it.' The climate of Kharag has always been deemed very salubrious.KHA—KHA The atmosphere is less moist than that of Bushahr. The maximum range of the thermometer in the hot season is seldom above 95° in tents, and with “ tatties ” it can often be kept down to 75°. The best anchorage on the east side of the island is as follows :— Kharagu or Kharag from north-west by north to south by west half west, the adjacent island of Kharagu north by west to south by east. Halilah peak in Persia south-east by east in 9 fathoms, sand off shore half a mile. Ships should always be guarded against a shift of wind, so as to be able to clear the Send (?) of Kharagu in time, particularly as the bottom is loose and the island hereabout is fringed with a coral reef. The passage between Kharagu and Kharag ought not to be attempted at night, except in cases of great necessity. There used to be a very good pearl fishery off this island. Kharag is under the jurisdiction of the governor of Bushahr. The island of Kharag was occupied about 1748 by a detachment of Dutch from Batavia under Baron Kniphausen. They came in two ships, and found no difficulty in taking possession of the island, where they instantly erected a small fortification ; in consequence the island rose rapidly in importance. The local position was peculiarly favourable to commerce, and it possessed great advantages in the abundance and excellence of its fresh water and the salubrity of its climate. Its population, which amounted formerly to a hundred poor fishermen and pilots, increased within the eleven years that the Dutch held it to upwards of 12,000 souls. On the death of Baron Kniphausen his successors measures were not equally good and the place declined, till the Dutch, being surprised by the pirate Mir Muhana, were driven out of the island in 1765. On the Persian advance against Herat in 1837, the Indian Govern ment sent a small detachment to occupy the island of Kharag, and their numbers were so much exaggerated by the time the news reached the Persian court that this measure had the effect of making the Shah raise the siege. The detachment first sent to Kharag consisted of 500 men of the 15th, 21st, and 24th Bombay Native Infantry, and 30 native artillery men, with one officer and two 6-pounder guns, and arrived in June 1838. Afterwards four companies of the Bombay European Regiment, two 6-pounders, an 8-inch mortar, and 24 European artillerymen arrived on 22nd September to re-inforce them. On the raising of the siege of Herat, the detachment was withdrawn. ( Malcolm — Morier — Wilson — Taylor — Bruchs — Winchester — Fontanier.) The fort and village of Kharag are situated at the north-west point, which is low and sandy. The village contains about 400 men, chiefly fishermen and Basra pilots. There is a small garrison of regular Persian troops, with one or two guns. Excellent water is procurable, here from wells close to the beach and at a cheap rate. A few cattle and some vegetables, &amp;c., may be procured. [Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) KHAR AH—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Ears, 130 miles east of Shiraz. It is a neat village and 384885 25 KHA—KHA has a good bazar, which affords abundant supplies. It is situated in a picturesque and romantic country, consisting of low and luxuriant valleys or plains intersected and separated by ranges of low mountains, green to their very summits with beautiful turf. (Poitinger.) KHARANAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A place on the road to Biabanak from Yazd, 45 miles north of the latter. It has eighty houses and an excellent caravansarai, good water- supply, but few supplies of other kinds. A range of mountains called Kuh-i-Kharanak is said to commence here, and run in the direction of Ardakan on the west. They are exceedingly steep and rugged, shut ting out all view on the northern side. [MacGregor.) Gill says this place should be Khar-Khanah, and that its elevation is 5,450 ft. KHARANIH—Lat. Long. Elev. A village 27 miles north of Yazd on the road to Herat. Bread, grain and forage abundant; water brackish. This is possibly the same place as above. [Christie.) KHARGU or KHARAGU—Lat. Long. Elev. An island in the Persian Gulf, off the coast of Ears, and about 14 to 2 miles north of Kharag. It lies north and south, is 2| miles long by half mile wide, contains about 2 square miles, is of a light sandy soil, and is surrounded by a reef half mile wide. It has plenty of water, but not of so good a quality as that of Kharag; and, although only occasionally inhabited, is capable of being cultivated, and will produce both wheat and barley during the rainy season. It was minutely sur veyed by Captain Goodfellow, Bombay Engineers, and plans of it furnished to Government. Khargu was the stronghold of the celebrated Arab pirate Mir Muhana, whence he plundered all vessels going up or down the Gulf, and issued to surprise the Dutch garrison of Kharag. [Monteith — Bruchs.) Khargu is barren and uninhabited, has some brushwood and a few stunted trees on it at the north end, where indifferent water may be obtained by digging shallow wells. [Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) KHAR-RSHUTAR ZAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Khuzistan, 45 miles from Shustar on the road to Man- gasht, inhabited principally by the Gulgirdi branch of the Janaki tribe, and situated in a small plain and lying between Taulah and Gulgird. [DeBocle.) KHARSUN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in the Kuhgehlu country, which carries the south-west drain age of the Kuh-i-Dina into the Karun. The two branches which form it are crossed on the road from Isfahan to Bihbahan, the first one (Ab-i- Derruhun) at about 12 miles west of Sisakht, and the second one (Chaujehuu) a mile further on. Bell writes, 8th June 1884, as follows:— u Ab-i-Berruhun. —Barometer 24-6' / (5,870'). Passing up stream it is forded at a point where its waters run in three channels; no channel386 KHA—KHA exceeds 70 feet in width; its bed is bouldery; current swift; depth about 3 feet; it requires to be forded with care; banks low and of boulders. Passing still up-stream, over the bouldery and sandy strip of land between the two arms of the river, the Chaujehun branch is forded; it is shallow, with a bouldery bottom; width 200 feet; its left bank is steep and 100 feet high. The two branches join at 1 mile, in a direction of 325°, to form the Ab-i-Kharsun; the general line of the valley of the rivers is here 175° and 280°. {Bell.) According to BelFs map the Kharsun appears to fall into the Karun, a few miles from Hilisat. KHASAMABAD (?)—Lat. Long. _ Elev.

The administration of this district was entrusted in 1882 to Haji Mirza Agha Khan, vakil, and his brother Fazl 'Ali Khan. {Stack — Foss.) KHISHT—Lat. Long. ~Elev. about 1,000'. A plain in Pars, situated about two-thirds of the way from Shiraz to Bushahr at the head of Kotal-i-Malu. It is a plain of an irregular oval shape, some 10 miles long by 5 miles broad, and surrounded by hills, except at the point where it overlooks the pass. A river winds down through the hills past the ruins of Shahpur, and bearing that name enters the plain of Khisht in a fine drinkable stream on its eastern side, and keeping close below the hills which skirt the plain on its east* and north sides, passes below the town and fort of Khisht, and finally descends to the gulf far to the north of the Bihbahan and Shustar line. Numerous water-ducts have been cut across the plain leading from the river-bed, and this portion of the plain is well cultivated with wheat, barley, rice, tobacco, and cotton; it contains also extensive date groves, perhaps upwards ol 2,000 date trees may be found. The plain is further dotted with old stumps of trees and brushwood. In the centre of the plain and on the high road is the group of hamlets called Kunar Takhta, lying around a commodious and solid masonry caravansarai. There are some 31 villages or hamlets suboi- dinate to Khisht, which is considered as .a revenue division. The fol lowing is a list of them with their distances from the fort of Khisht . 387 25 a388 KHI-KHO On the north, Mohledin, 2 miles; Aikuni, 5| miles; Bureki, 2 miles; Khojamali, 5| miles; Bozin, miles; Gurikel, 1 mile. On the east, KumaiTj, 11 miles; Banu ,11 miles; Rudak, 11 miles; Mobrizi, 18 miles; Siahmansir, 22 miles; Shul, 22 miles; Jamila, 28 miles; two Burekis, 3 miles. On the west, Mal-i-Shaikh, 28 miles; Dasht-i- Gur, 25 miles; Sardashtak, 28 miles; Khun-i-Surkh, 22 miles; Shul, 18 miles; Jarah, 22 miles; Chashistani, 3| miles; Burje- kan Bakar, 3| miles; Burji-Kaid Muhammad TakI, 2 miles; three Burekis, 2 miles. These villages may contain from 100 to 200 inhabitants each, dwelling in from 80 to 60 temporary huts. The produce of the country not required for home consumption is either consumed by passing caravans or is exported to Kazrun or Bushahr. The imports are piece-goods, sugar, and coffee for home use. The revenue, amounting to 7,000 tumans, is levied in the lump. The safety of the road traffic is provided for by the chief of the district, who maintains 50 irregular footmen for that purpose. The chief is responsible for all goods lost or plundered from caravans within his district, and charges a sort of transit due of 25 cents, of a kiran on every load of piece-goods, and 12| cents, on every load of miscella neous merchandise. Colonel Pelly is of opinion that English troops could not summer in tents or huts at Khisht without suffering. He passed two days in the sarai during July and two days in early part of September, during both periods a fiercely hot wind blew all day. In July the thermometer was at 96° in the early morning and about 110° in the heat of the day. Supplies are obtainable from the town of Khisht, which is 4 miles north-west of Kunar Takhta on the Shiraz-Bushahr road via Kazrun. [Felly.) KHOJA AHMAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

An entrance to Khor-SultanI near Bushahr, across a flat lying between Aflaf-dan and Lafkah bank. It is only used by small boats, as the entrance is exposed. There is another entrance between Ras-al- Jabu and ATaf-dan. [Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) KHOR B AMIS Hi R— Lat. 29° 59' 3O' 7 to 30°. Long. 48° 44' SO' to 48° 38' 30' / . The mouth of the Karun river on the coast of Khuzistan is so called. It was formerly used by .trading vessels, and was navigable a con siderable way up; but is now blocked by a dam near the Hafar canal.(0 KHO—KHO It runs in from tire *AIi Maidan, the soundings not varying more than a quarter of a fathom until you get as high as latitude about 29° 51' 30' north, when they deepen to 5 and 7 fathoms according to the time of tide, and decrease again to 3 and 4 fathoms at low water as you near the points. From the sea to Muhammarah there is a channel of not less than 9 feet 4 fathoms at low water. It was believed to be impracticable for navigation till Lieutenant Selby, I.N., tried it, and this opinion was probably fostered by the Turkish authorities in order to conduct all the trade of the Karun up the Shatt-ul-Arab, thus making it subject to taxation by them. The Bamishir (q.v.) is about 4U miles in length and about half a mile in width. Its general course is south south-east. Its entrance is at low water during spring-tides more than 3 fathoms deep. Its banks are but little inhabited, as its water, being often mixed by the tides from the Persian Gulf, is generally salt. [Selby — Layard-—Brucks.) The Khor Bamishir is Persian on both sides, while the right bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab is Turkish territory. [Champain) KHOR BANDAR GAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A large creek, by which Shif, near Bushahr, is approached. It runs close along the north end of Shaikh Sad, and has 5 to 8 fathoms in it opposite the tower on that island; it then turns south-east behind the creek, 1|- miles west of the tower, has only | fathom at low watei^; a reef rims off 1| miles south-west from the tower, and there is another projecting as much on the north side of this creek. [Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) KHOR BARKAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A channel between the shoal called Fasht-al-Muairith, coast of Khuzistan, and the shoals of Barkan.

It is formed by the island of Abadan on the west, and All Maidan on the east; has soundings from 15 and 18 fathoms in the southern part to 2| at low water at the upper, where a narrow channel runs into the Euphrates. This is an 389390 KHO—KHO excellent mark, coming from the eastward, for making the river. If you cross the 'All Maidan in 3£ fathoms low water, you will cross Khor Khafgahin 8 or 9 fathoms, and ought to keep down to the south ward a little, as this is in the parallel of the Maiyunah ? If you cross the ’All Maidan in 4 or 4| fathoms, which is the best line, you will cross Khor Khafgah in 13 to 15 or 16 fathoms, according to the time of tide, and the tail of the Abadan in 4 to 5 fathoms, when a course west, if a flood tide, will bring you on the Abdullah bank, 2^ or 3 fathoms low water, which is a fair berth for anchoring if the tide is not favourable for entering the river, as from this you can always run into Khor Abdullah if it comes to blow hard from the south-east, at which time no pilot will cross the bar. (Bruch.) KHOR KHALATA—Lat. 29° 31' 40' / . Long. 50° 36' 6'. Kiev. The mouth of the Gunawah river on the coast of Fars; it has 1 fathom at the entrance and 2 inside at low water. (Bruch.)

After rains a large quantity of fresh water is discharged through it; its banks at the mouth are low. The swampy coast, which extends from Umm Khailah island, ends a little above this; and the Bu-Raiyal hills come close down to the sea. , ... • n j This is the mouth of the Hand or Kara Agach river, as it is called in the earlier part of its course.

KHURAMABAD— '47° 43/ '1 (IliMdeneyra!) ,48° 34' [Belt).) ^ ev ’ (,4,050' [Bell), The capital town of Luristan, 117 miles south-east of Karman- shab, 98 miles south-east of Hamadan, and six stages north of Dizful. There is a fort here which occupies the crest of an isolated rock rising in the centre of a precipitous pass, and the town is on the south-west face near the commencement of a rich plain. The Wall of Luristan resides here. The town is situated at the foot of a Long, jj mountain and in a narrow valley, through which flows a broad rapid river. The town is small and protected by a fort, sufficiently strong to deride the efforts of a Persian army. The fort is built on a corn eal hill in a centre of the town, which is connected with the gardens on the opposite side of the valley by a bridge of twenty-eight arches thrown across the river. Khuramabad is a singular place. A range of rocky hills stretch ing across the plain in the usual direction of north-west and south east has been suddenly broken off to admit the passage of the river Kashghan for the space of about f mile, leaving in the centre of the open space a solitary rock nearly 1,000 yards in circumference; the rock is very steep, and near its summit is a most copious spring. This is the fort of Khuramabad. It is surrounded by a double wall at the base, and the summit where the palace is built is also very strongly defended. The fort mounts eight guns. The palace is a very elegant building. A magnificent reservoir, 60 yards by 40, which is fed by the spring, has been formed within it, and there is also a garden of some extent. The fort contains exclusively the palace and its de pendent buildings. The modern town, which is small, containing not more than a thousand houses, is built below the fort on its south^ west face. M. Rivadeneyra (1875) says that Khuramabad has a population of 50,( 00. The river, a broad shallow stream, passes along to the south-east of the fort and town; the banks are covered with gardens, and among these are to be seen the remains of the old town, the capital of the Governors (Atabegs) of Lur-i-Kuchak. One and a half miles from the town this river is crossed by a two- arched bridge. Khuramabad now lies on the right side of the river; the old town was situated on the left side. The latter has been identified with the Shapurkhast of old geographers, but Schindler says Shapurkhast is the present Jaidar. The most notable ruins of old Khuramabad are a 60-ft. high circular brick tower, with a Kufic inscription round the top, the foundations of the walls of the building, a masjid probably, in which the tower stood,—part of a large aqueduct, with a high stoneKHU—KHU 393 wall—and many walls of smaller buildings. A bridge, of which ten arches are still standing, led somewhat south of the present town from the right side of the river to the old town on the left. It was part of the old road, called the Jaidar road to the Karkhah Valley. The bridge leading to the present town is a modern construction built about the beginning of the present century by 'All Mardan Khan, Governor of Luristan. The ruins are of the class peculiar to the Saljukan ages. The Khuramabad district seems formerly to have been called Samha. Regarding Samha the Akrad-Namah says that Atabeg Shuja-ud- din sent his sons Bedr and Haidar from Manrud to Samha to fight the Jangardi tribe. The sons went there and besieged Diz-i-Siah. The citadel of Khuramabad is occasionally, even now, called Diz-i-Siah. There are five roads from Khuramabad to Dizful. {Frederick — Chesney — Kinneir — Rawlinson — Jones — Schindler — Rivadeneyra.) Bell (20th April 1884) writes— “The road from Dizful crosses the bridge over the Ab-i-Khuram- abad, and enters the town. The bridge of masonry, recently repaired, is of solid construction; its arches are pointed; width of bridge 18 feet, length about 300 yards. “This, the last stage into Khuramabad, presents no difficulties other than can be readily overcome, until the descent from the Kuh-i-Bowi is reached. All the undulations are gentle; the slopes of their skirts are gentle; the greatest slopes equal 20°. “ Besides the tribute of 60,500 tumans raised from the Feili Lurs in 1836, the town of Khuramabad was taxed 5,000 tumans, and its crown lands 2,000 tumans and 2,000 kharwars of grain, each kharwar valued at 1 turn an. The other crown lands paid as follows :— Saimarah Tumans. 2,000 Kharwars of grain, 2,000 Jaidar 1,000 . . 500 ’Alishtar 1,000 Kuh-dasht . 230 200 Tirhau . 500 700 KIr-Ab . 100 . . 500 (Rawlinson.) The town, the capital of the Feili Lurs, lies at the head of the gorge of the Ah i-Khuramabad, which is about 1 mile broad, and to the north of the valley of the Dar-i-Rud and Ab-i-Khuramabad, a valley of con siderable length and several miles broad. It is surrounded by a low mud wall of no military importance. The hills forming the gorge are steep and barren; those in the distance are still snow-topped. The Bala-Hisar, in which resides the ruler of the district, the town and its environs, are in a more or less ruinous state; a dry camping-ground lies to the westward of the town. The town, fort, &amp;c., are command ed from high ground to the eastward within easy rifle range. The place is of no military strength. The river when crossed was a shallow muddy stream not 100 feet wide : fordable everywhere. At times it carries a large volume of water. The Bala-Hisar is built on the summit of a solitary steep rock, near the centre of the gorge, and close to the right bank of the river.KHU—KHU 394 Near its summit is a copious stream. Round about its base are fine gardens, well irrigated, and dwelling-houses, &amp;c., enclosed by walls of no strength, about 15 feet high. It contains about 2,000 inhabitants, and is the residence of the ruler of the Luristan district, extending southward across the Lur hills to Dizful. The town is rapidly falling into ruins. Trade was most inactive owing to the insecurity of the Dizful road (1884). There is here a Persian post and telegraph office. Its roads are narrow and difficult to traverse; its houses, said to number 1,000, are chiefly of mud; roofs flat; bazar of insignificant size. The camping-ground, suited for one brigade, lies to the west of the town. The river here breaks through a range of rocky hills stretch ing across the plain in the usual north-west direction, leaving standing the solitary rock, nearly 1,000 yards in circumference, upon which the fort is built. There are two roads from Khuramabad to Burujird. The route taken by DeBode is the most direct, but tents are met with along it only during the summer months. Caravans, &amp;c., prefer that taken and now described. N.B.— With reference to the practicability of constructing a cart-road from Mtihammarah to Khuramdbad, it may be here convenient to note that from Muhammarah to Dizful, 173 miles, the country is practically a level alluvial fat, to construct a road across ivhich raising and ditching only is required ; road metal can be obtained from the hills about Ahwdz, Shustar, and Dizful. From Dizful to Khuramdbdd, a distance of 157 miles, with reference to the facilities Jor constructing a cart-road, the tract has been classed as good, fair, and bad; the good, 57 miles, is level and requires nothing to be done to it beyond the removal of loose boulders to the existence of which Lurs are quite callous ; the fair, 60 miles, requires to be widened and cleared of stones ; the bad, 40 miles, requires to be widened and to be zigzagged in places to lessen the gradients; in the ravines or passes large boulders icill require to be blasted; otherwise there is little rock- cutting required, and picks, crow-bars, levers, sledge hammers and gun cotton will do all that is required. Within the hills road-metal is plen- tiful. Colonel Bell estimates the cost of construction as follows Rs. For the parts classed as good ..... 20 per mile. ,, j, &gt;, „ fair ..... 100 ,, „ » », „ bad 500 „ and for increase in length caused by its diminished gradient Rs. 500 per mile. The average cost per mile therefore would be Rs. 160. {Bell.) KHtJRANAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A halting-place in Yazd, about 26 miles north-east of Ardakan. {MacGregor.) KHtTR-LSHfJLI—Lat. Long. Elev.

A province of Persia, situated in its extreme south-west corner. It is bounded north and east by Luristan and the Bakhtiarl mountains, south by the province of Ears and the Persian Gulf, and west by the Shatt-ul-Arab and the Pashalik of Baghdad. Layard gives the following boundaries of Khuzistan :— “ The following are at present generally considered as its proper boundaries :—To the north and east the mountains of the great chain on which the first snow usually falls; to the west the river Karkhah, although the pastures on its western bank are inhabited by tribes under the Wall (Governor) of Hawizah, and are usually considered as Persian ground ; to the south the Jarahi or Kurdistan river, and a line drawn across the desert from the Karun to the Karkhah, a few miles above the junction of each of the rivers with the Shatt-ul-Arab, or Euphrates ; to the east the Kurdistan. Within this province, there fore, are included the towns of Shustar, Dizful and Hawizah, the plain of Ram Hurmuz, the Bakhtiaris, part of the Faili and part of the Chab Arabs : the latter tribe, however, have hitherto been assessed397 KHU—KHTJ by the Governor of Fars. Bilibahan, although in our maps included in the province of Khuzistan, is properly in that of Fars. “ Khuzistan has a length of about 200 miles from Kala-i-Itaza to the Jarahi river, a breadth of 130 miles from Muhammarah to the northern mountains, and an area of 25,677 square miles. “ It is divided politically and administratively into two districts, viz., that of the Shaikh of the Chab Arabs and the government of Shustar. Its southern portion is composed of low-lying plains in dented by numerous c khors, ’ or inlets, and often inundated by the ri vers which run through it in such profusion. The northern part consists of fine open plains, bounded in their highest parts by the mountains. “ To the south and west of the province are the homes of wander ing tribes of Arabs under their different Shaikhs, and on the north and east are tribes of Lurs and Persians. “ To the north-east of Khuzistan is the lofty chain of the moun tains of the Bakhtiari—a continuation of the main Kurdistan range. Their summits are frequently within the range of perpetual snow, but they are interspersed with fertile valle 3 ’s, which are well watered and possess a generous soil. These mountains are the summer residences {y ail ah') of the Lur tribes. To the south of them are found highly fertile valleys and spacious plains, on which are the winter encamp ments of the same tribes. Beyond these, again, there occurs a range of hills, varying from 5,000 to 2,000 feet in height, running parallel with the great chain, and consisting of sandstone and a very friable limestone, much intermixed with gypsum ; and to the west of these are vast plains stretching in almost one uninterrupted flat to the Tigris, the Shatt-ul-Arab, and the sea.” The only hills in Khuzistan are the above-mentioned hills, which Layard mentions as a parallel and separate range to the main range. This, I think, must be a mistake, and it seems more probable that low hills are merely the ends of spurs from the main range which spread out into an appearance of distinctness from their parent. Khuzistan is abundantly supplied with rivers, being in this re spect different from the rest of Persia. Of these the most important are the Karun, Dizful, Karkhah, and the Jarahi. The climate of the upper part of Khuzistan, about Shustar and Dizful, is very healthy _ ^ Of the mineral productions near Mai Baud are tound white naphtha and bitumen, and limestone abounds in all the low hills. The population of Khuzistan is mostly composed of wandering tribes: these are the Faili, Bakhtiaris, the Kuhgehlu, Mamaseni to the north, and in the south the Arab tribes of Anafijah, Ali Kathlr, the Chab, and Bani Lam. In addition to the care of cattle, which is the prevailing occupa tion, agriculture is carefully attended to, and the quantity of tobacco, rice, and other grain (especially barley) produced along the banks of the river is considerable. Some cotton is likewise grown, and in the district of Ahwaz sugar was abundant at no very distant period. On the lower parts of the Karun and Karkhah, as well as in the Chab country, dates are sufficiently abundant to be an article of commeice.KHU—KHU 398 In addition to the bitumen and naphtha of Band-i-Kir, Dara-i-nafat &amp;c., tents, red cloth, coarse woollens, and some cottons are manufac tured, the last chiefly at Dizful, where dyeing is extensively practised. Large flocks of sheep, with a portion of goats, camels, horses and mules, are to be seen on all the rich pasture-grounds of Susiana. Occasionally permanent walled villages are met with, but the greatest part of the inhabitants live in tents, which are of a large size, being supported by a number of poles in parallel rows, lessening in height from the ridge towards the sides, which are very low. This kind of tent is more commodious than that which is in use in other parts of Persia or in Arabia. In the latter country more frequent changes of residence render one of a higher and smaller construction necessary. The principal towns of Khuzistan are Shustar, Lizful, Ram Hurmuz, Fellahiah. The communications of Khuzistan to the foot of the mountains are extremely open and easy, by means of the numerous rivers which intersect it, especially the Karun. The Chab country is diffimilt by reason of its flooded state in winter and the almost total absence of water in summer. Prom Shustar there is a route to Isfahan and Shiraz by Bihbahan, and to Baghdad through the country of the Bani Lam Arabs. From Dizful there are routes to Khuramabad and Burujird, and thence to Karmanshah and Hamadan. Khuzistan is under the administration of the Governor of Arabist an, who is usually a member of the Royal Family. The holder of the office in 1879 was Prince Hamza Mirza, better known by his title of Hishmat-ud-Daulat. His nominal residence is Khuramabad in Luristan. The collection of revenue is the only function of Govern ment which the Prince Governor performs, all other matters being left to the discretion of chiefs or governors of the six districts into which Khuzistan isdivided. The revenue is of two kinds :—“diwan,” which goes to Tihran and “ pishkash,” which the Prince Governor takes for himself. The six districts, their present chiefs, estimated population and the revenue of both kinds which they paid in 1879 is as follows District. Present chiefs or Governors. Estimated population. Revenue.

They have adopted many Persian customs, and greatly esteem Persian women as wives. There is however a general feeling of hostility between Persians and Arabs, especially among the lower classes. The following list of the tribes of Khuzistan contains all those which are still of importance, and some which are no longer of any. Of the seventy-two tribes which composed the Chab nation some have emigrated to Turkish territory ; others have died out, and of others mere fragments remain. The Chab tribes which are still influential are the Muhaisin of Muhammarah and the Hanafirah, Asakirah, Mujaddin and Al-bu-Ghubalsh of Fellahlah. The subdivisions or branches of tribes are innumerable. Only those which have quite separated from the parent stem and. become independent of it appear in this list. [Layard — Chesney — Robertson.) Principal tribes of Khnzistdn or Persian Arabia, 1879.KHW—KIF The following is a short summary on Khuzistan by Lieutenant- Colonel Bellj 1884:— Khuzistan is the ancient Susiana, so called from the name of its capital city, Susa, and the still more ancient Elam, originally peopled by Turanians and the descendants of Shem. It fell to Persia on the downfall of the Assyrian Empire. The boundaries are roughly the Bakhtiari hills, the river Karkhah, a line drawn from Hawizah to Muhammarah, and thence by the coast line to the Hindian river. From a point above Muhammarah generally to the Hindian river to the north of Dilam, the inhabitants are of the Bani Chab Arabs, under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Arabistan, head-quarters Dizful. Under him are subordinate Governors at Muhammarah, Fella- hiah and Dih Mulla. The frontier village above Dilam is Shaikh Abul-Shaikh or Shah-Abul-Shah. The Government of Bihbahan adjoins that of the Chab Arabs to the south and west, and is under that of Fars, the head-quarters of which are at Shiraz. The minor settlements to the southward of the Hindian to Bushahr embrace a series of petty tribes, both Persian and Arab, living in their own circles of villages and interfered with by the Central Persian Govern ment very much in proportion to their several means of resistance. They are subordinate to the Government of Bushahr. Of the settle ments, fths are probably Persian, jth Arab. As a general rule, the Arab circles of villages are farmed and administered by their own Shaikhs, who arrange their own civil disputes, and pay a lump sum as revenue per annum. They are coming every year more and more under the local officers of the Shah. The Persian circle of villages or a Persian port comes directly under the local officers of the Shah.

A village in Fars, situated in the plain of the same name, about half way between Shiraz and Lar. It is a large village, a good deal in ruins, with three or four poor shops and a caravansarai. It is watered by a small stream from the hills and an ancient Jcandt. The plain of Kir is about 25 miles long and lies nearly east and west. It is said to contain thirty villages. Most of it is watered from the Kara Agach. It usually has a pleasant appearance, owing to the turf with which it is clothed and its numerous palm groves. When the water is in sufficient quantity, it is very fertile and the corn stands over 5 feet high. Besides this the plain produces barley, rice, tobacco, sesame seed, opium, and excellent dates and fruits. Near the village Kir it juts out into the lake in the form of a promontory. In the summer the Kir plain is intensely warm, and is then forsaken by the tribes, though its other inhabitants remain in the village, suffering, however, greatly from the swarms of flies which infest the country, and from sore eyes. Above the village Kir stands an earthen fort, which in the reign of Mir Muhammad Shah was held by 200 men against the Ilkhani of Firuzabad, who is said to have besieged it with 10,000 horse and 2 guns. It was afterwards dismantled, the garrison having made terms. The administration of this district was entrusted in 1882 to Mlrza Ahmad Khan MuId-ul-Mulk, son-in-law and nephew of the Sahib-i-Dlwan. {Kinneir — Abbott — Stack.)403 KIR—KOM KlRAB or KILAB or KlRAH— Lat.

A village in Khuzistan, on the bank of the Karun, between Ahwaz and Ismailiah. {Layard!) KOTAL-I-DUKHTAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears, over a low range of hills between Kazrun and the plain of Abdul. The ascent commences 9 miles from Kazrun, and is about one in 8 or 10. The road is excellent. At the foot of the mountain there is a causeway across a creek of the salt lake, called the Darla-i-Parlshan, which is said to be deep but narrow. The road has been carried by stone steps directly up the face of the mountain, with a few very abrupt zigzags, and nothing can be more unpromising for baggage and artillery than the appearance of this passage. The road is said to have been constructed by a merchant, and appears to have been carried up the steepest face of the rock. Clerk, writing in 1857, says the road leads down the precipitous sides of a lofty mountain; the roadway for the most part being perfectly smooth, quicklime hav ing been used in filling up and levelling the way after the stones had been laid down. A strong stone parapet, also finished with brick and lime, is continued for about 2 miles, the length of the roadway. So perpeiidicular is the mountain that a stone might be thrown from the summit to any part of this way. Monteith mentions having searched for a more practicable route, and having come to the conclusion that if another causeway, or bridge, were thrown across the creek, a toler ably easy road might be made about half a mile to the east of the present one, and then the hill up which the present road is carried would only require to be occupied by the flanking party in place of the high rocks to the west; on the east the hills are not so roexy and aie much easier of access. The ascent of this pass is not more than a mile, after which a much easier descent leads to the valley of Abdul. DeBode says the following circuit may be made on the road from405 Bushahr to Shiraz to avoid the descent of this pass, which is terrible for a train of artillery :—On descending Pirzan turn to the right through the valley of Dasht-I-Blr of Abdul, cross the plain of Chanush- jan which communicates with it, and thence pass into that of Shah- pur which forms part of the vale of Kazrun. This circuitous road has the shape of a horseshoe, and presents no obstacles for the transit of baggage, but it is 45 miles in length, while the other is only about 15 or 16 miles. Clerk also thinks that the road, instead of scaling the highest and most precipitous mountain of the range, might have avoided this pass by going a little more to the south; and Taylor mentions a road that goes from Kazrun by the Tang-i-Turkan, and striking north-west passes the village of Nadun about half-way. This road is longer, 48 miles, the one by the pass being 32 only. Rich describes the road as most skilfully constructed, buttressed, levelled, and parapeted so as not to alarm the most timid, and broad enough to allow of several mules abreast. It was in thorough repair and, he considered, almost worth coming to see. (Monteith —Be Bode — Tay lor — Clerk — Hardy .) MacGregor says this pass rises about 500 feet (Stack 1,000) in 2 miles, and is all built up with retaining walls. The gradients are not, as a rule, severe for hills, but the roadway is simply execrable, the lime of the original paving having broken away. Nevertheless a deter mined leader could get guns up, and without very much labour the road might be much improved. The heights above afford an exceedingly strong position, as stated above; but the hills to the right and left are certainly practicable for light infantry, and the pass could be turned. This pass is one of the difficulties of the Bushah^’-Shiraz trade route. {MacGregor.) KOTAL-I-GIASH—Lat. Long. Fdev. A pass through which the road runs from Bushahr to Kazrun just before it enters the Kazrun plain. From it a fine view of the Shah- pur plain can be obtained. {MacGregor.) KOTAL-I-KUMARIJ—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Fars, 85 miles, on the road from Bushahr to Shiraz. It is described as very steep, and obstructed by fragments of rock, fallen from the mountain’s side, about which the road winds, sometimes through chasms so narrow as scarcely to admit a loaded mule, and at many turns impending over torrents and abysses, where one false step must precipitate the traveller into destruction. It is 1,400 feet above the plain below. The ascent takes nearly five hours by a narrow preci pitous road, supported by a wall on the lower side, and altogether so diffi cult that, if adequately defended, it could scarcely be forced by an army till turned by another road, but guns have been carried across it. [Ouseley — Monteith — Chesney.) There are excellent positions for signalling all up the pass, vide Kumarij. {MacGregor.) KOTAL-I-M ALTT—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Fars, 63 miles, on the road from Bushahr to Kdzrun.406 KOT—KOT From the right bank of the river, about 7 miles from Dalaki the ascent commences, and at first is easy for 2 miles : thence for 2 miles it is difficult and steep, the road zigzagging shortly up over slippery masses of rock and stone, the last part being exceedingly rugged and difficult. In forcing this pass, it would be necessary to occupy the rocky heights on both sides. For about ^ mile the road is tolerably good, and Monteith thinks that by throwing a bridge of date-trees across, and passing over from the right to the left side of the defile, a much easier path might be opened. The name Kotal-i-Malu is not universally used; several other names being bestowed according to the fancy of the people. {Clerk — Monteith.) Stack describes this pass as a rocky staircase, 1,000 feet high, with its landing in the plain of Khisht 1,800 feet above the sea. Part of the road is paved with stones, but the rest is the work of nature; except the last half mile or so. Of this pass, the road could all be made practi cable for field artillery. The elevated ridge of rock to the left affords a very strong position, and it would be absolutely necessary to take it before attempting the pass in the face of an enemy. {MacGregor.) KOTAL-I-MOSGHUN—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Fars crossed on the road from Shiraz to Kazrun between Mosghun and Gerreh.* On the Shiraz side the pass itself is steep, but the road is fairly good and lies nearly throughout on very soft lime. On the Kazrun side the road is more stony perhaps than before, and the descent is sharp and unpleasant. {Durand.) KOTAL-I-PiRZAN—Lat. Long. Elev. 7,500'. A pass in F5rs, between Abdui and Dasht-i-Arjan, 38 miles south of Shiraz. It is the longest of all the passes on the Bushahr and Shiraz road, but is much more practicable than any of the others. Monteith thinks it would not be necessary to dismount artillery, though the guns would require the assistance of soldiers to drag them up the steep ascent, a distance of nearly 3 miles. About half-way up the pass is the sarai of Mian-i-Kotal, where travellers can stop. Stack found this caravansarai clean and in good order in 1882. The chief difficulty of this pass is owing to the large loose stones, and if less steep it is, if possible, rougher than the Kotal-i-Dukhtar.

The first has an area of perhaps a dozen square miles, backed by a semicircle of hills, and green with orchards and fields, and extensively interspersed with white patches of salt. Five villages stand in the plain, Kuhbanan itself being the chief; they are well watered and cultivate more poppy than wheat. The village Kuh Bauan is embosomed in mulberry trees, and maintains a small manufacture of silk. On a spur of the hill above the village are the remains of an old fort, and a little lower, a mile from the vil lage, stands a platform of hewn stones, with two low towers above it, called the throne of Latlf Shah. The latter was a governor of the district, who was slain by the Afghans under Ashraf and Mahmud, when they sacked the district. In the middle of the plateau are found beds of “ kankar,” or nodular limestone. The present (1882) governor of Kuh Banan is an official from Tihran. {Stack.) KtJH BIHBAHAN— Lat. 30° 29' 10'.

They adjoin the Bakhtiaris, and occupy the mountains to the south of the valley of Mai Daud as far as Basht, a village on the road between Bihbahan and Shiraz. The Kubgehlu consider themselves as distinct from the Bakhtiaris, having always lived under different chiefs and under a different govern ment to that of Shiraz. Their dialect, nevertheless, differs little from that of the Bakhtiaris, and their manners, customs, character, and religion are the same. They are divided into the following tribes:— Chahavbanichah Teibi. Bo her Ahmed. Nuwi. Dushmanziari. .Charumi. Bahmahi Bawi .. Yusafi Aghajerl . Tekajeri . Geghatine Magdeli . ■S :S Ahmadi. Muhammadi. Kalakal. Kuhmarah. Shir All. Shahruwi. Telah Kuri. Jamah Buzurgi. Afshar. The Kuh Gehlu are under the governor of Bihbahan, and chiefly inhabit the western part of the great chain of hills : their summer and winter quarters are little more than a transition from the fort to the summit of the mountains. A description of the larger divisions of this tribe will be found under their own titles, viz., Bahmahi, Faili. These tribes are estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000 families, and they can raise 10,000 well-armed men amongst them. Shiel, however, gives a somewhat different list from the above— Bawl Kuhmari . . 1,200 800 | Live near the Mamasenis. Bovair Charumi . . 2,000) . 1,000 j Live in Kuhgiluza, but are a broken tribe.

Felly again only estimates them at 4,000 to 5,000 households, divided jnto four tribes :—Bovair, Ahmadi, Bahman Bawl, and Kuwl. {Layard — Shiel — Malcolm — Kinneir — Telly.) ? Regarding this tribe Baring says they are divided into two great sections, viz., the Pusht-i-kuh and the Zir-i-kuh (q.v. for subdivisions and their chiefs). On the Shiraz side the Kuhgehlu march with the Mamaseni, to the north and north-east with the Kashkais and Bakhti- aris, and to the west and north-west with the Arabs. Part of them is under the government of Arabistan, but the greater portion is under that of Pars. Regarding their total number nothing certain is known. Those inhabiting the mountains near the source of the Jarahi river are said to number 15,000 families, with 10,000 fighting-men. {Baring — Persia, IP. 0., Ft. I.) Bell (1884) remarks &gt; “ They are bound to their governors by no ties of patriotism or friend ship ; in fact, the reverse is the case. The same remark applies to the whole of the Arabs and Iliyat tribes inhabiting the coast plains between the Karun and Bushahr and the mountains of Luristan stretching from Karmaushah to Shiraz. Persians consider Lurs as robbers. They have their own chiefs, by whom they are governed, and who are re sponsible to the Persian Government for the annual tribute. So long as this tribute is paid, and the tribes do not harass their Persian neigh bours or engage in serious hostilities among themselves, their internal government is not greatly interfered with. The Governor of the Kuhgehlu and other tribes is the Zil-us-Sultan, with head-quarters at Isfahan. Under him Deputy Governors reside at Shiraz, Dizful, and Burujirdc” KDH-I-AB-I-GARM— Lat. Long.

The plain is situated near the summit of the pass called Kumarij Kotal. It is a level patch, 9 miles by 4, shut in by hills 600 to 800 feet high. The village has about five hundred inhabitants and lies at the foot of the hills on the north-western side of the plain. Its grey houses are flat-roofed and built of stone. It has also a fort and a ruined sarai. Very few supplies are procurable, but forage is abun dant, and fuel is obtainable from the nomads in the vicinity. The water is for the most part brackish, but there is one passable well; caravans usually avoid this place. The K6tal-i-Kumarij is remark able for the singular conformation of the long flat-topped hills at its foot, and the extreme badness of the road. Half-way up the road becomes so narrow that a laden mule strikes its load against the rocks on either hand. It is literally a staircase, ascending 1,200 feet, shut in by overhanging peaks on the left (going to Kazrun) and with a torrent bed far below on the right. The opposite side of the torrent bed is flanked by a black wall of rock, 300 feet high. On account of its narrowness great inconvenience is experienced when caravans from opposite sides meet in the middle. The administration of thisKUM—KUN district lias been in the hands of Haji Mirza Aga Khan and his brother Fazl 'All Khan since 1882. For Medical Considerations see Kunah takhta and Dasht-i-Akjan.

A village in Fars, situated in the middle of the plain of Khisht, 61 miles from Bushahr and 31 miles from Kazrun. The village is inha bited by nomads. Supplies in abundance can be procured from the neighbouring villages. The water in the wells at this place is brack ish; good water, however, is procurable from a spring 2 miles dis tant. Draught cattle are procurable in the neighbourhood. There is a caravansarai here with an arched gateway leading into a yard, round which are rooms for travellers, and behind them stalls, and there is also a small suite of rooms over the gateway. In the centre of the yard is an elevated platform, the roof of a subterraneous cham ber called “ Zir-i-Zamin/'’ to which travellers retire during the great heat of summer. It has a telegraph station. The name of this village signifies “jujube bed/' from the bush which flourishes in the neighbourhood. [Monteith — Clerk — MS. Route—Jones — Morier — Stack.) Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Per sia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between Dalaki and Kunar Takhta “ The climate is less damp and slightly less hot and enervating than the district between Dalaki and Bushahr. During July and August, hot winds are prevalent. Good drinking water is procurable from the hills, a few miles distant. The food of the people is essentially the same as about Dalaki [c[.v.), as also are the diseases to which they are liable. Ophthalmia, especially prurilent ophthalmia, is perhaps less common ; it certainly is of a milder type, and causes less mischief.'' 418 4KX&gt;N—KUR KUNG—-Lat. Long. Elev.

The Marbura stream joins it 800 feet below the Karkunan. The remains of the project for hewing through the Karkunan and the remains of the dam for turning the water into the cleft remain. The river has a picturesque source, and hence retains its name after joining the Marbura, though the latter is a larger river. The rapidly rising current, says Stack, breaking in blue sheets, over shelving rocks or boiling in deep pools, is a perpetual pleasure to the senses. An at tempt was made by Shah Abbas to turn the Kurand into the Zainda- rud. {Stack.) KURANGA—Lat. Long. Elev.

The province of Persian Kurdistan covers a large area, and is bounded on the north by the Persian province of Azarbaijan ; on the west by Sulimama and other Turkish territories included m the Vilayat of Karkuk (?) ; on the south by Karmanshah; and on the east by It contains sixteen districts, viz., Marivan, Banah, Saklz, Karaftu, Khurkara, Hawatu, Lailagh, Isfandabad, Chahardaulah, J a warn, Bilawar, Juanru, Avroman, Kalat-i-zan, Hasanabad, Ramisht, with ' Mirabad. . The capital of the province is Sihna, or Sihnahdij (?), as it is com monly called. The population of the province of Kurdistan consists wholly (excepting the inhabitants of Sihna) of hill people and noma tribes. The following list of the Uiyats of Kurdistan is only supposed to be approximately correct:— Tentg 300 S ‘ In the district of Sakiz, Kalhur Hawatu, Tailaku „ Gulbaki Isfandabad, Shaikh Ismail „ Purpish'Sh . Hasanabad, Mundami Bilawar, Mamun, Jabrachi „ Gushki Lailagh, Gurgai . „ Lak Shamshiri 600 500 300 300 500 300 400 300 1,000 400 All these tribes are Suni. The Shaikh Ismaili Shamshlri and Purpishah have their winter pasture grounds in Turkish territory. Persian Kurdistan was governed for centuries by Guran princes of the house of Bani Ardalan, under the title of Wall of Sihna. At the date of Rich's visit (about sixty years ago) Aman-ullah Khan, the Wall of Sihna, was almost independent of the Tihran government, though, as a concession to the Persian Court, he and the chief members of his family professed the Shiah faith. Amanullah was a strong ruler, who exacted the most implicit obedience from his own children, ministers, and subjects. He appointed whom he pleased to be governors of the different districts of Kurdistan, and even in the case of the chief- ships of Avroman and Banah, although the field of selection was by custom restricted to one family, the particular individuals to succeed to a vacancy was named by the Wall. Ghulam Shah Khan was the last Wall of Sihna of the house of Ardalan. His father married a daughter of Path 'Ali Shah, a princess of a very vigorous and deter mined character. She was the virtual ruler of Kurdistan, and ad ministered the affairs of the province in open darldr . Her son, Ghulam Shah Khan, died about twenty years ago, leaving a brother, Raza Kuli Khan, and three children, sons. These were all set aside, and Mutamad-ud-daulat, the present Shah's uncle, was appointed the first Hakim of Kurdistan. It does not appear that the people made any objection to the change of ruler. Rich points out that the peasantry of Persian Kurdistan are not clansmen, and notoriously even not animated by that love for, and devotion to, their princes which439 KUR—KUR marked the relations between the Kurdish Chief of Sulimanla and his tribesmen. Moreover, the Walls of Sihna were a cruel rapacious race, deserving little sympathy, and probably their people were not sorry to be rid of them. However this may be, the subjection of the chief of Avroman appears to have been the principal difficulty with which Mutamad-ud-daulat had to contend. The details of the struggle belong to the general history of Persia, and it is sufficient here to mention that eventually Avroman was brought under control, and its two divisions are now governed, the upper by Dlwan Begl Mirza Arzu 'All, the son, and the lower by Abbas Kuli Beg, the brother, of Hasan Khan, the last of the Sultans of Avroman. Mutamad-ud-daulat administered the province for nine years, and has been followed by a succession of Persian governors. The ancient family of the Ban! Ardalan has been reduced to poverty and insigni ficance. The three sous of Ghulam Shah Khan reside at Sihna, but they have squandered their money and sold their immense estates; and they have now little else to live on than the allowance assigned them by the Persian Government. One of the family is Hakim of Ardabil in Azarbaijan, and is well off, but he owes his position and wealth to the patronage of the Kajars. Another, Muhammad 'All Khan, son of Raza Kuli Khan, and, consequently, nephew of Ghulam Shah Khan, is Sartlp of the Fauj-i-Kurdistan, or Kurdistan regiment of infantry. He is a thorough Persian. The present Governor of Sihna is Abu'1-Fazl Mirza, son of the Hisam-us-Sultanat, and son-in-law of the present Shah. He is not a little proud of his high connections, and likes to affect royal manners and generally to play the Prince. He looks forward to the time when Turkey will be weak enough for Persia to risk a war, or, when Persia might, through the intervention of some other Power, obtain the territory in Irak which Persians so dearly covet. His Highness does not trouble himself much about the condition of the province over which he rules. The administration is carried on by the Wazxr, who has himself farmed the revenue. The amount to be collected is nominally fixed at 60,000 tumans; of this sum 25,000 tumans are retained for local expenses, and the balance remitted to Tihran. But, as the WazTr has to make his own profit, and also to pay a yearly pish-kash to the Prince-Governor of not less than 10,000 tumans, it is evident that the exactions from the people must considerably exceed the nominal assessment of the province. . _ , Population, trade,prices, and agriculture .—The population ot the town of Sihna consists of about 65,000 persons, and is increasing every year. (For trade and prices, vide Sihna.) Land is cultivated under one or other of the following arrange ments :—• 3 , 11) Nisf-i-Kdri .—Under this system the cultivator and the prg- prietor of the land divide the produce equally. The cultivator supplies the seed and necessary labour. The landlord pays the maliat and the expense of reaping.KUR—KUR (2) Lah‘U-du .—Under this arrangement, which is most common in Kurdistan, the produce is dvided into twelve parts, of which the proprietor takes two, the cultivator ten, the latter paying all expenses. (Z 7 . C. Plowden.) KURDISTAN RIVER—See Jarahi. KURDS— A race inhabiting the west of Persia, and giving its name to a province called Kurdistan. Kurds are Sunis, and bitterly hostile to their Shiah rulers. The Southern Kurds are divided into twelve clans : Sahna, Sakuz, Banah (Suj Bulak, Suliraania), Abramani Suni (Tahela, Turkish*), Abramani Takht (Sulimania), Juauru, Miandarband (Karmanshah), Kamanghur, Sursur (Karmanshah), Isfanabad (Hamadau), Pilakho (Aushar, Persian), Kurkera (Aushar, Persian). As to what their numbers may be, it seems pure guess-work. Some say one million, some two, some a half. Dissensions and clan feuds weaken them, as they did the Scotch Highlanders, and they do not attempt resistance to the Persians, whose present army is far from formidable, but in the event of any invasion the great fact would be that the invaders would find auxiliaries rather than enemies in them, which, considering the nature of the country, is of enormous importance. Persian-born Gover nors are now beginning to replace the Kurdish Chiefs, who up to now were always Governors of their own districts. None of the present Chiefs have any great authority. The Makri Kurds, Suj Bulak district, are, perhaps, the most numerous, but there is now no one recognised head. Habbi Beg, Juanruni, whose head-quarters are at Kellak, 8 farsakhs from Zohab, is said to be the biggest man, and to have from 26,000 to 100,000 clansmen. The Jafs, who are on both sides of the frontier, on the Diala, and chiefly nomads, and are considered Kurds, though apparently more resembling Arabs, are divided into the Kash- kai, Sursur, Babagani, and Abrami clans, and are popularly said to muster 35,000 horsemen. Muhammad Pasha, who lives near the Sulimania-Kifri road, is the most powerful man of those parts, vide Kurdistan. {Gerard, 1882.) KtJRl^—Lat. Long.

A province of Persia that extends westward for about 270 miles, from the borders of. Ears to those of Karmanshah, with an ordinary width of about 70 miles, and a superficies of nearly 19,500 square miles. Being placed along the Bakhtiari range, it is chiefly mountainous, although there are some plains toward the opposite side which are well watered by the numerous affluents of the Karun, the Dizful, and the Karkhah rivers. It has a population of about 56,000 families, com posed of the Eeili. Luristan, says Rawlinson, is divided into two provinces, Lur-i-Buzurg and Lur-i-Kuchak, the greater and the lesser Luristan. The former is the mountainous country of the Bakhtiaris, stretching from the frontiers of Ears to the river Dizful ; the latter is situated between the river and the plains of Assyria, being bounded to the north and south by Karmanshah and Susiana. This province of Lur-i-Kuchak again is divided into two districts, Pish Kuh and Pusht-i-Kuh, the country before and behind the mountains, referring, of course, to the great chain of Zagros. Between the 12th and 17 th centuries, the province of Lur-i- Kuchak was governed by a race of independent Princes, who were named Atabegs. The last prince of this last royal race, Shah Yerdi Khan, was removed by Shah Abbas the Great, and the gov ernment was granted to the chief of a rival tribe, Husain Khan, with almost unlimited authority, and with the title of 'Wall, in exchange for that of Atabeg j his descendants have retained the title, which in Persia is almost equivalent to royalty ; and, though their power is now greatly weakened, they still affect a royal style in their manners and establishment. Owing to the intestine divisions of the family, Pish Kuh, which is by far the fairest portion of Lur-i-Kuchak, has been wrested from them, and placed under the direct control of the Karmanshah government. Pusht-i-Kuh, however still acknowledges the sway of the Wall. When the whole of Lur-i-Kuchak was under the dominion of the W alls all the tribes were included under the gene ral denomination of Feill, the peculiar title of Husain Khan's clan. At present, however, the inhabitants of Pish Kuh do not acknow-445 LUR—LUR ledge the name in any way; they have a distinct classification of their own, and the title of Feili is applied alone to the tribes of Pusht- i-Kuh, who are under the sway of the Wall. The maps, therefore, are incorrect when they describe the whole of Lur-i-Kuchak as “ a mountainous country inhabited by the Feili tribes.' The following remarks by Bell (1884) give more recent information about Luristan:— The general features of the hilly country between Karmanshah and Shiraz, and to the south of the valleys of the Burujird, Kamandarab, or Kamandap and Zaindarud (Afhus branch) streams, inhabited by Lurs, known as the Feili, Bakhtiari, Kuhgehlu, and Mamaseni, may be described in a few words. A lofty chain of mountains running south-east forms a kind of nucleus. Their summits are frequently within the range of perpetual snow. They are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well watered, and possess a generous soil. The belut, or oak, abounds; and other trees and shrubs, such as the walnut, Main chain. pomegranate, fig, vine, &amp;c., are found in the valleys, and other sheltered places. These mountains are the Yailaks (Sardsir), or summer residence of the Lur tribes. In them are found the sources of those important rivers, the Karim, Karkhah, the river Dizful, the Jarahi or Kurdistan river, the Zorah, &amp;c. To the east and west of these, and at a considerable elevation above the sea, are found highly fertile valleys and Elevated valleys and S p ac i 0US plains. To the east Faridan, Chahar- plains ‘ Mahal, Linjan, Silakhor, the valley of Burujird, &amp;c.j to the west Dih-i-Dasht, Mal-Amir, Tul, Kal a-Reza, Saimarah, These valleys and plains are either watered by rivers and streams, or owe their fertility to the accumulation of winter torrents, which, rushing down from the mountains and finding no outlet, form a lake, or reservoir, which lasts till the middle of the summer. Their soil is extremely rich, producing corn and barley, and forming excellent pasture lands for sheep and cattle. Those to the west of the mountains are the winter encamping-grounds of the Bur Iliyats. To the south and westward of them there occurs a range of hills, varying from 2,000 to 5,000 feet in height, bounding the gulf plains, running parallel with the great chain, and con- Outer chain. sisting of sandstone and a very friable limestone, much intermixed with gypsum. They contain but few springs of fresh water, and abound with pools of naphtha or petroleum, bitumen, and sulphureous or brackish water, and frequently, as at the naphtha springs near Ram Hurmuz, have a burnt and volcanic appearance. The soil also is generally covered with a large deposit of saline mat er. The summits of these hills are usually tabular; their sides furrowed by innumerable torrents, which sweep down with irresistible violence during the rainy season. They are consequently precipitous, and frequently inaccessible to heavily laden animals.446 LOll—LUR ♦ The country rising from the coast in a succession of table-lands, it follows that the southern and western slopes of these hills are longer than the northern and eastern. They are seldom inhabited to any considerable extent, except during the winter, when rain-water accumulates in the bottoms, and the hills are then clothed with grass and flowers. The soil is favourable to the growth of corn and barley. To the south and west of the low hills are those vast plains known by the Persians as Arabistan, stretching in one Gulf plains. almost interrupted flat to the Tigris, the Shatt- ul-Arab, and the sea. With reference to the character of the Feili tribes of Lurs, the , i. • i.

With Haji 'All Khan were 1,000 families of the Sagwand subdivi sion of the Bajilan tribe; with his brother, who is at enmity with him, are 500 families; he described his tribe as being impoverished by government exactions, which they were unable to meet; certainly, none of them were wealthy, and many were poor, Haji ’Ah Khan. w here all should have been rich. Haji 'All Khan may be described as a “ chip of the old block.” In character he resembles Kalk 'AH Khan, the murderer of Captains Grant and Fotheringham. Many deeds of cruelty and severity are laid to his charge, and perhaps nothing can instance the increasing power now exercised by Persia over these still lawless tribes, and the restraint that their chiefs have to put upon themselves, than the conduct of Haji 'AH Khan during the time that the party remained his guests. Notwithstanding the letter from the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, he at first received the party coldly and inhospitably; supplies were obtained with difficulty, and not until asked for. Rumours began to spread that I was a sartip, called to Tihran by the Shah to join the army, and that I was also about to visit the Zil-us-Sultan, the only man feared in these hills. They had, no doubt, been spread by the resident Wazir at Dizful as a means of securing from Haji 'AH fail- treatment. They had the desired effect; Haji 'AH now acknowledged me as his guest, and directed his tribe to sell to the party whatever provisions they required. He and his numerous sons, together with the Sharif-ud-din, a mulla who travelled with him, frequently visited our The Sagwand Lurs. cam p to chat, and never w T earied in admir ing our arms, clothes, saddlery, &amp;e„ and my orderly and myself daily447 LUR—LUR # passed some time in his tent. The Lurs are a simple-minded people ; the men are light-hearted and joyous ; the women go unveiled ; the young are well favoured, vpith ruddy cheeks and dark auburn or black hair ; they age early, but not so the men: a fat or stout man or woman was not seen; as a rule, their figures are wiry and well knit to endure fatigue. The prevailing diseases appeared to be indigestion, rheumatism, fever, liver and spleen, due to scant clothing, sleep ing on the ground and exposure to cold. The women wear loose shapeless dresses, affording no warmth and little underclothing. The clothing of the children is of a like character, affording no protection against the cold to the stomach and the regions of the spleen and liver. The women applied for charms to bring back the lost love of a husband, lost generally by reason of their sterility ; to induce child birth, &amp;c.; for amulets to be worn on the caps of their infant sons with the idea that the fortune of the giver would follow the child throughout life, and to this extent I became sponsor to the most infantile of Haji 'All’s many sons. The sick of the tribe came for medicines. Ordinary pills had little effect, but when six failed to satisfy, I threw up the case. Unmolested, I was allowed to move about the camps of the various families; each family or group of families camped on the pasture land told off to it, and each with its flocks and herds took the road assigned to it on the march. The confusion on the line of march passes description; sheep, goats, bullocks, donkeys, &amp;c., horsemen, and foot passengers, blocked the narrow hill paths ; the cries of the herdsmen and herdswomen, “ Al-o-ha” were heard everywhere, and when in the narrow ravines the pressure and crush were the greatest, the chiefs would add to the hubbub and confusion (tamasha, spec tacle, they called it) by discharging their rifles, of which the tribe possessed about a dozen (Peabody’s Martini-Henry). Great interest was taken in my movements and my note-book excited special curiosity. Many were the exclamations “ What does he write ?” The subjects of conversation that most interest all Lurs are our political relations with Russia, Turkey, Egypt, and Afghanistan, our marriage laws and social customs. Great Britain is known as London ; admiration is apparently felt for both Turkey and Egypt for having spent such vast sums of foreign money and declining to repay them. Russia is recognised to be a great power. _ Afghanistan is looked upon as a British possession, and its Amir to rule it by our favour. Great interest everywhere was taken in the movements of the Mahdi. The sympathy with him is political rather than religious, it being hoped that he, a Muhammadan may conquer a • Christian power and be an agent destined to raise the fortunes of Islamism. A withdrawal from the Sudan will be construed into a Christian defeat and a Muhammadan victory. ... , The Muhammadan tenets do not appear to be strictly kept by them. Haii Ali observed the hours of prayer, only because, perhaps, the Sharif-ud-din, to whom he was greatly indebted for a money loan to enable him to meet the demands of the revenue officers, was his guest.452 but the distribution fluctuates at the discretion of the Persian Gover nor. The tribes of Pusht-i-Kuh and the dependencies are not included in this arrangement, but have a separate amount of revenue assigned to them. The valuation of 1 katir* varies, as with the Bakhtiaris, accord ing to the state of the province; but under the late Wanr Mirza Buzurg, who administered the revenues with eminent success for about ten years, it was raised to the rate of 200 old tumans, or of the present currency; the 120 ‘katirs* were, therefore, equivalent to 40,000 tumans, and the amount annually realised from pishkash alone rather exceeded than fell short of this sum. The following table exhibits the revenue system, as observed by Wazlr Mirza Buzurg. The sum realised from the tribes amounted to 60,500 tumans, but the Government possessed another source of revenue in the town of Khuramabad and the crown lands scattered over the province accord ing to the following list:— Names of Districts. Taxation in money. Taxation in grain. Remakes. t Revenue of town Khuvamabad ] ( Crown lands Tnmans. 6,000 Kharwars. 2,000 2,000 i This consists of the rent of shops. Saimarah 2,000 2,000 ' gardens, orchards, mills, and customs. Jaidar 1,0 ( '0 500 ’Alishtar 1,000 Kith Dnsht 230 200 Tirlian ...... 500 700 KIr-Ab 100 600 Total 10,830 6,900 If we reckon the ‘ kharwar &gt; of grain at one tuman, which is the usual valuation in Luristan, this will give an addition to the revenue of 17,700 tumans, and raise the whole amount, which may be annually realised from the province to 78,200 tumans. The system of revenue in Pish-Kuh is very simple; when the 120 katirs have been duly distributed among the tribes and their subdivisions, in a general council and to the satisfaction of all, each subdivision determines the amount of share to be paid by the different camps of which it is com posed, and the Rish Safid of each encampment collects from the different families under his rule according to his knowledge of their individual ability to contribute. But in a wild country like this, where many of the tribes live in a state of open rebellion, and will not attend to the distribution apportioned by the general council, the Governor would certainly fail in his contract to the crown, un less he had indirect means of raising extraordinary revenue to make453 up for many defalcations. Mirza Buzurg, therefore, introduced an extensive system of fees and fines; and, where robberies and murder were of almost daily occurrence, he did not want opportunities of exaction; indeed, he is said to have realised about 20,000 tumans annually in this manner, and that, too, without cruelty or injustice. Lur-i-Kuchak is far more capable of sustaining a heavy taxation than the* Bakhtiaris, for, though agriculture is equally neglected, it has other valuable sources of profit. The principal of these is its breed of mules, which are esteemed by far the best in Persia. It certainly exports, on an average, 1,000 of these animals annually;and, taking the mean price at 20 tumans, this alone will give a sum of 20,000 tumans of yearly produce. The Iliyat drive a considerable traffic also in carpets, packing-bags, and all descriptions of horse-fur niture ; they exclusively supply the towns of Hamadan, Nahawand, and Burujird with charcoal, and their flocks and herds likewise afford them a considerable profit. The great tribes of Pfsh-Kuh have no single chief like the Bakhtiaris; neither indeed have the subdivisions in general. Some four or five tnshmals are usually associated in the government of every subdivision, and on great occasions all these tushmals meet as equals and consult; so that their internal constitution more nearly assimilates to the spirit of a confederate republic than of a great feudal aristocracy. The Wall of Plsh-Kuh alone retains the kingly power of his ancestors. Among the Lurs most of the offices of labour are performed by women ; they tend the flocks, till the fields, store the grain, and tread out that which is required for use. The men content themselves with sowing and reaping, cutting wood for charcoal, and defending their property against the attacks of others. The carpets, the black goat- hair tents, and the horse-furniture, for which Luristan is famous, are almost all the work of the women. The men seem to consider rob bery and war their proper occupation, and are never so well pleased as when engaged in a foray. The language of the Lurs differs but slightly from that of the Kurds of Karmanshah, and a person conversant with one dialect will perfectly understand the other. These dialects of the mountaineers of Zagros have been' hitherto assumed by all writers as remnants of the ancient Pahlavx, but apparently on insufficient grounds, as they are probably derived from the old Farsi, the Farslkadlm as it is called, which was a co-existent, but perfectly distinct, language from the Pahlavl in the age of the Sassanian monarchs. Certainly the Pahlavl, as we read it at the present day upon inscriptions and in books, does not possess any analogy with the Kurdish, and it is doubtful if any dialect of it now exists as a spoken language, except among the Gabr colonies, and in a few detached villages of Azarbaijan. The religion of the tribes of Lur-i-Kuchak is very curious, and well merits to be attentively observed; for, although the foundation of all 'All Xlahism is the same, consisting in the belief of a series of succes sive incarnations, yet they have superinduced a number of local super stitions, apparently of remote antiquity. The Lurs do not affect the slightest veneration for Muhammad and the Kuran ; their only general454 object of worship is their great saint Baba Buzurg ; but there are also several holy men amongst them who are considered the living representatives of the divine principle, and who are thus regarded by their particular disciples with a reverence little short of adoration. Their sacrifices and their mystical meetings form a subject of much interest; for many of their observances are certainly to be traced to a source long anterior to the institution of Muhammadanism. Macdonald Kinneir has noticed the midnight orgies of the Charagh-Kushan. It is not prob able that any such rites are observed at the present day, but meetings of this nature were certainly held until within the last half century, and there cannot be a doubt but that we may recognise in them a relic of the worship of the principles of generation and fecundity, which had descended through the orgies of Mithra and Anatis, from the time when Sesostris erected the emblems of the sexual organs as objects of adoration, and Semiramis, delivering herself to indiscriminate pleasure, doubtless intended to fulfil a religious cere mony. The great branch of Plsh-Kuh is divided into four tribes, each of which has numerous subdivisions; it is without a supreme chief, having power over the whole body, but each tribe and almost each subdivision has its own particular head or tushmal, who acknow ledges no other authority than that of the Shah when he is able to enforce it. The system of government pursued in these tribes is the same throughout the whole of the tribes in Persia. Each tribe has its chief, who exercises an unlimited authority over its members. The tushmals are merely chiefs of families or of subdivisions, who are employed in collecting the tribute, and are considered re sponsible to the chief for the good order and allegiance of those placed under their care. They may resort to any means they think proper in raising this tribute, and may imprison or even put to death those who belong to the division over which they are placed; but they are accountable to the great chief for that part of the tribute apportioned to their division, and must follow him in his wars when he needs their services. It is upon these conditions that they hold their power as tushmals; and if these are neglected, they may be immediately displaced. The constitution of these tribes bears, in fact, a very strong resemblance to feudalism. The chief himself accounts with the government, and is left to raise the tri bute through his tushmals. The four tribes of the Pish-Kuh are generally at war with each other. They are notorious for their plundering propensities, par ticularly the Dilfan and Silah-Silah. The country they inhabit can seldom be traversed in safety either by single travellers or caravans. The tribe of Dilfan furnishes 800 men, who form the Luristan regiment. Of this number 300 are raised from the subdivision of &amp; Yuvetiwand, 400 men from that of Mumiuawand, and 100 from that of Raisawaud.455 LUR—LUR The members of the tribe of Dilfau are chiefly ^Ali-Ilahis in religion. The tribe of 'Amalah, as the name denotes, were originally em ployed by the Walls of Luristan as their immediate servants. Several of its subdivisions are still called after the services that their members used to perform, as mirakhur, katlrji (head muleteer), ghulam (slave). This name is still applied to that portion of the tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh which encamps with the Wall. The '’Amalah are Dili Nishlns, who cultivate the crown lands in the neighbourhood of Khuramabad. The tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh are under a Wall whose ancestors were the chiefs of all the Feili Lurs. Hasan Khan, the father of the Wall, when Layard visited these tribes, was the last who possessed that powerful post. He was, however, vested with authority over the tribes of the Pish-Kuh by the Persian government, his legitimate right only extending to those of the Pusht-i-Kuh. Kalb 'AH Khan, who was of the same family, opposed him with some success, but was finally murdered when in the camp of Muhammad'All Mirza, who had by an oath of safe conduct prevailed on the chief to join him. Hasan Khan died at a very advanced age. His three sons had ejected him from the government of Luristan, and after his death they divided the tribes subject to him. The eldest, 'AH Khan, enjoyed the chief authority in Luristan, the following tribes acknowledging him as their chief :—Kurd, Shahan, Dlnarv Lurt, Hademeni, (?) Sagwaud, and Bairanwand; the two latter tribes, however, only when he had power to enforce his authority. Ahmad Khan holds half the tribe of MehakI, and Haidar Khan the remainder, with the tribe of Panj Situn. 'AH Khan, in addition to the tribes above mentioned, possessed the villa 0*68 of Dih Luran and Bayat, and extensive pastures in the plains, which are usually inhabited by the Banl-Lam Arabs, who pay a small sum yearly for permission to occupy them. Of all the tribes the Sagwands give the most trouble to the Persian government. Relying upon the strength of their position, they are often for some months in open rebellion. Before the arrival ot the Mutamad in Khuzistan, in the spring of 1841, the whole country was in a most disturbed state and the roads very unsafe : caravans were frequently plundered, and the communication between Shustar, and Karmanshah, and Khuramabad, by the mountain passes, almost en tirely cut off. The country is at present in a more quiet state, and hostages have been given by the chiefs as securities for their future good conduct. Lur-i-Kuchak was formerly included in the government of Karman shah but since the removal of the Mutamad-i-Daulatto Isfahan, it has been’made over to him. The usual residence of the governor of Pish- Kuh is either at Khuramabad or in the plain of Saimarah. It is very difficult to form a correct estimate of the forces that might be raised in Lur-i-Kuchak. The Wall may probably be able to collect between 4,000 and 5,000 men, of whom 500 or 600 are horsemen The Sagwands have about 300 horsemen. The gross amount of armed456 LUR—MAD men that might be raised in Luristan may, perhaps, be between 4,000 and 5,000 horsemen and 20,000 matchlockmen. The Feilis pretend to have more respect for an oath and to be less bloodthirsty than their neighbours, the Bakhtiaris; but there is very little difference in this respect between them. Several subdivisions of the tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh have left their mountains, owing to acts of oppression on the part of ■’All Khan, and have sought refuge in the Dihat, or small villages dependent upon Dizful, settling as ryots and engaging in the cultivation of the soil. For further information see under headings of different tribes. (Rawlinson — Layard!) LURT—Lat. Long, Elev. A plain in Luristan, on the right bank of the Karkhah river, 22 miles below its junction with the river of Karind.

The villages are all dome-roofed. The average number of houses in each is twenty to thirty. A good deal of grain is exported hence to Hamadan, local prices being somewhat higher than at Bijar, but less than half the current rate at Hamadan, distant only two days' journey. Carriage is scarce; mules may be procured in the villages, but not in large numbers. No camels. It is in the Kurdistan province on the borders of Karmanshah.

It is a poor village, but has a caravansarai and some garden land, a few cypress trees, and some sixty or seventy families. Water is obtained from springs, but few supplies are procurable. The lake of Nairiz, or Daria- i-Namak is sometimes called the lake of Mahalu. (Abbott — Ouseley — Jones.) Mahalu mountain and salt lake are situated near the village ; i.e., the principal peak of the range so called, which overhangs the lake. The elevation is about 7,800 ft.

It has a ruined ditch, four gates, and a small citadel within it. A clay is found here from which a number of porous water-vases are made. The district of Maibut is dependent on Yazd, and appears to possess seventeen vil lages and eight hamlets, besides the towns of Ardalan and Maibut. The revenues amount to about £3,000. Snow does not remain long on this part of the plain, but in winter a dry cold of considerable intensity is experienced. In so arid a country the heats of summer must be oppressive. Has a post-house and fine caravausarai, with an excellent covered tank, and a conspicuous ice-house, also a spring of pure water. It is also celebrated for the manufacture of “ Zailis,” or coarse cotton carpets. {Abbott Sniith—E. Smith—Floyer.) 458459 MAI—MAK MAID AN 'ALl or J ALl-MAIDAN— Lat, Long. Elev.

MAL AHMADIS— A tribe of Bakhtiari originally a subdivision of the Baidarwands. They have, however, long separated from them, and now encamp perfectly distinct. They accompanied Nadir Shah in his expedition against Kandahar, and afterwards settled for a short period in Kandahar. They then returned to their own country by Sistan and Karman to Shiraz, and settled in the district of Falat, driving out the original possessors. The country occupied by them being within Ears, they pay tribute to the governor, but the tribe itself being included within the division of the Bakhtiaris, they also pay the capitation tax,—the former amounts to 400 tumans, the latter to 300. They consist of about 1,000 families. ( Layard.) MALAlR—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Luristan, lying between Hamadan and Burujird. It contains 50,000 or 60,000 inhabitants. {Schindler.) MALAMlR—Lat. Long. Elev. 2,930'. An extensive, fertile plain to the east of Khuzistan, near the sources of the Karun. It is, perhaps, the most remarkable place on the whole of the Bakhtiari mountains : on all sides the most precipitous mountains rise almost perpendicularly from the plain. To the east it is divided into two parts, which are separated by a range of limestone hills branching out from Mangasht. It is badly irrigat ed : a few springs rise at the foot of the hills, and a stream of brackish water flows through the midst. The eastern extremity of the plain in the winter and spring is converted into a marsh. Indeed, the whole after-winter rains is sometimes inundated, as the torrents that rush down the mountain sides have no outlet. There is a small stream running from Mai Amir through a narrow defile to Halagan, but it is frequently dry. This plain is the Kishlak of the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris. The centre of the plain is well cultivated, wheat and barley being grown. There are several sculptures in the neighbourhood. The old name of this plain is Idej or Izej. {Baring.)

In this gut the Kanguu boats are laid up when dismasted for the season. {BrucJcs.) MAMASENIS— A tribe who reside to the north of Kazrun, in Ears, their principal stronghold being the Kala Safid. They are celebrated as one of the most lawless tribes of Persia. They claim descent from Rustam, having emigrated, they say, from Sistan. Their subdivisions, &amp;c., are thus given by Baron DeBode :— Divisions. Number of families. Encampment. Remarks. Rustam! M ah am ad Salih!. 100 Sar-ab-i-Siah, Diar in the plain of Bahrain. The RustamI are consi dered the bravest, and can bring 200 horsemen well- armed and mounted into the field. Bakash ’Alivand . 100 Nurabad Tang- i-Shahpur. Next comes the Bakash ; between these tribes there is much hostility and jealousy. Dushman Ziar! Bowi 100 100 Ardakan near Shahpur. Chenu- shejau. Near Kala Safid. / The two remaining tribes, though nearly equal to the others in numbers, are poorer ( and less powerful. | One part of the Dush- I man Ziari is under the protection of the Rustam!. Baring also gives sections called Fahliun and Allam Salih. Morier, in addition, gives a section called Zali, and Layard one called Guvi. Baron DeBode places their numbers as low as 400 families, while of other authorities Layard places them at 3,000, Shiel at 8,000, and Morier from 10,000 to 12,000. The Mamaseni have by degrees made themselves masters of almost all the arable land formerly pos sessed by the inhabitants of Fahlian, who complain bitterly of the exac tions—one to which they are constantly exposed. This tribe have al- wavs o-iven a great deal of trouble, and after the death of Path 'AH Shah ^the communication between Bushahr and Shiraz was almost cut off by one of their chiefs Wall Khan Bakash. They were, how ever reduced by a detachment of regular troops from Azarbaijan. It is said that on this occasion their women, 100 in number, rather than fall into the hands of these troops, threw themselves over the preci pice with their children, and were dashed to pieces. They have to pay a tribute of 7,000 tumans per annum to the Ears Government. The real name is Muhammad Husainis. n 7 - 7 • \ {Morier — Layard — DeBode — S/uel—Baring,)462 MAM—MAN The following abridged notes are by Lieutenant-Colonel 2884 • “ The country inhabited by the Mamaseni is known as Shulistan ; to the east it is bounded by the dependencies of Ears; to the south by Kazran; to the west by the Kuhgehlu ; to the north by the Ardakan chain (Kashkai pastures). “The Mamaseni, or Muhammad Husaini, are divided into several tribes, numbering some 3,000 or 4,000 families. Their principal stronghold, Kal'a Safid, a “diz” of size, elevated 1,500 feet above the level, and said to be 4 miles in circumference, and well supplied with water, is now of no importance, the tribe being well under subjection ; they are now an agricultural and pastoral people, through whose terri tory it is fairly safe to pass. Farhad Mirza, recently governor of Ears, brought these formerly unruly people into subjection. The roads from Bihbahan to Bushahr and Shiraz can be traversed without an escort, if the traveller be provided with letters from the Governors of Bushahr or Shiraz, or from the Prince governing the province of Ears. This tribe has always been friendly to the English and accustomed to look to them for protection against the Persian Government. They are a fine race, with features very like the ancient Persian type. They may be assumed to be able to put 1,500 men into the field. They are Lurs and speak the Lur dialect with local modifications. Every village has a loop-holed defensive tower within it. Many of them consist merely of reed huts round the tower. The Nasir-ul- Mulk now (1884) administers the government of Bihbahan and Mamaseni districts. MAMIVAND or MEMlWANA— A tribe of Chahar Lang Bakhtiaris who, with the ZalakI, num ber about 7,000 families. They are chiefly engaged in the cultivation of the soil. They do not descend into the Garmsirs, except the Isa- wand, one of their subdivisions, who encamp here during the winter months. The subdivisions of the tribe are Abdalvand, Zarcheguni, Zalaki, Busak, Bosi, Isavand, Bu Ishak, Sharifvand, Minjavi, Basnayi, and Sakl. [Layard) MAMULlYAH—Lat. Long.

It is a place of some strength against an unscientific enemy, and is the residence of the Mahmud Laleh branch of the Chahar Laug Bakhtiari. The pro per name is Mlandizan. (Layard.) MANGANON or MANJANlK— Lat. Long. Elev. A valley in Khuzistau, through which the river Tala flows, some ruins here. (DeBode.) MANGASHT—Lat. 31° 27'. Long. 50° 10'. Elev. A fort on the Bakhtiarl mountains, 78 miles, on a road from Kumishah to Shustar. It stands on an isolated mass of rock, scarped all round to a depth of 150 ft., and therefore is difficult of access, and was of great celebrity during the Persian wars. The open ground on the summit of the rock is about half a mile in circumference, and contains two perennial springs. Mangasht is the name also of a range of hills in Khuzistan, a continuation of the Zagros chain; they are lofty and precipitous,—the highest peak being within the range of perpetual snow,—and are destitute of soil and vegetation. Naphtha is plentiful in them. They are visible on the road from Shustar to Band-i-kir. {Imp. Gaz. — I. B. } W. 0. } 1881, Part I.) M AN GEBRAH—Lat. Long. Elev.

A canal south of Ahwaz on the Karun in Khuzistan. It runs from Sid-i-SulIman to Kaban. When Kaban got ruined and Fellahiah began to prosper, the Sahnaniah canal was dug. A branch was also dug from the Marid canal to Fellahiah. The Marid canal and the mounds of the old dyke are generally called “ Sabla.” The Marid canal has water at high tide as far as Fellahlak. (Schindler.) MAR1VAN—Lat. 35° 31'. Long. 46 c 19'. Elev. 4,725'. A district of Persian Kurdistan, about 40 miles west of Sihna. It is the largest of all the dependencies of Sihna. (Rich.) The following are extracts from Mr. T. C. Plowden’s Report of a Journey through this district in 1881, “ The plain of Marivan, on which the fort stands, contains about a dozen villages, of which Neh (?) and Khanamuan (?) are the largest. Neh can be seen from the fort, and comprises about two hundred houses. The lofty and rugged mountains of Avroman overlook the fort on its south aspect; near as they appear to be they are distant 6 farsakhs, or a long day’s march. There are three passes which lead up the Avroman hills by precipitous paths so narrow that two “people cannot go abreast. The hills round Marivan and Avroman are densely covered with a fine forest of oak, walnut, chanar, or plane tree and various wild fruit-trees. The gathering of gall-nuts is one of the chief occupations of the people, and the nuts are exported, not to Sulimania in Turkish Kurdistan, which is comparatively near, but to Hamadan, some four marches beyond Sihna. The fort of Marivan is a substantial stone enclosure, about 300 yards square, and was built ten years ago by Farhad Mirza (Mutamad- ud-daulat) during the period of his rule over Persian Kurdistan. The mud used as cement is so friable that extensive repairs are required every year. On the walls of the fort were mounted half-a- dozen brass nine-pounders cast at Tabriz forty years ago. They were in a very dirty and uncared for condition, and the carriages were broken. The guns had not been fired for five years. Thirty artillery men and a company of the Fauj-i-Kurdistan constitute the garrison. Water is brought by a conduit from a spring outside the walls, but there are also two wells inside the enclosure. The fort is corn-465 30 MAR—MAR ©&gt; manded by some low hills on the right, and can be of little use for the protection of the district. The men of the garrison said that they got no pay, but were allowed a half-oke of barley a day; and even this pittance was not given regularly. They lived by robbing the government and the people as often as they got the chance. They complained bitterly of their treatment, and of the government, and wished that some foreign power would annex the country. The local levies, or militia, of Marivan are subordinate to the Mustaufi BashI, or Hakim of Marivan; these consist of about 1,500 tufangchis, armed with flint guns, and 200 horsemen. Only half the tufangchis serve at one time. A regiment of infantry, nomi nally of eight companies of 100 each, and called Fauj-i-Kurdistan, is furnished by the surrounding districts as their quota for the regular forces ; this is not under the authority of the Hakim of Marivan, but is commanded entirely by its Sartip. The names of these officials, respectively, are Mirza Muhammad ISadik and Muhammad 'All Khan. The regiment was armed with heavy muzzle-loading muskets, sighted to 550 yards. Gerard (27th March 1882) writes— “ Marivan is situated among valleys with lovely grazing ground. A small square fort, with flanking bastions, is here close to the village : it is of somewhat modern construction. The Kurd Civil Governor of the district treated me most hospitably, and also the Persian Commandant, who has 10 gunners and 30 Sarbaz as garrison. MARYAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A hill in Pars, beautifully wooded, and covered with vegetation to the summit; near the road between Masarm and Jarah. {Durand.) MARYDASHT—Lat. Long. Elev A plain in Pars, about 22 miles north of Shiraz, crossed on the road to Isfahan. The soil is alluvial, and there is an abundance of good water. ’ It is a district of Pars, and contains only seventeen villages at the present day, though LeBrun was informed in his day that it contained 880. The soil of this plain is, in general, less stony than that of Shiraz, and is chiefly composed of marl. In many parts, and parti cularly to the south-west, it is a decided clay. The plain is 15 miles in width, and about 40 miles long. It is higher than Shiraz, and possesses every requisite but good government to become most populous. Though there are very few villages in the plain, numbers of Iliyat feed their flocks on its wide expanse. It extends from Pul-i-Khan to the gorge of the Mashhad river, and from Tajabad to Jahlium. Its villages are Tajabad, Shamsabad- Izabad, Dih Chasht, Rajabad, Fahwanda, Gashak, •’Aliabad, Rush- maiju, Khuslik, Khurmalik, Haulatabad, Sahlabad, Amrabad, Hilibid, Piruri, Kinara, Jahlium, Ahmadabad, Jahvanjan. Its provisions consist chiefly of rice. The Iliyat plunder people, it not kept in order. The productions of the district from the winter sowings are wheat, barley, bran, and a little opium, and from the summer sowings rice,- ' : 466 MAR—MAS grain, teel, castor, and cotton. Wells says that On April 28th it looked green and fertile with numerous fortified villages dotted along the line of the Band Amir river. {Clerk—Morier— MacGregor—Ross—Wells.) MARWAN,—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in Ears, about 60 miles north of Shiraz on the road to Yazd. It is situated close to the “ Pasagardse ” ruins, and the tomb of Cyrus, and is composed of a few miserable hovels, the inhabitants of which'have annexed some of the pavements of marble from the neigh bouring ruins, with which to build their houses. {MacGregor.) MASHHAD-I-MURGHAB— Lat. 30° 16' 35'. Long. Elev. 6,100' {St. John). A village in Ears, 66 miles from Shiraz and 126 miles from Yazd, on the road between them. A few supplies and some fuel are obtainable. Water is procured from a small stream. • There are lead mines in the neighbourhood, 7 i lbs. of the ore of which fetches about 8 shillings. This is probably the same village as Murghab. It is rather a superior place, with better gardens and houses than f are usually to be seen in Persia. The Khan lives in a large building near, which is half house and half fort, and forms a very picturesque feature in the landscape. It is strong enough to answer its purpose of overlooking the village, but would be of no use whatever against European troops, as it is commanded at short musket-range by a range , of hills to the north, and the walls would soon be battered down. The village itself is built on a slight mound, and the houses better than usual. There is a great deal of water here, with much cultiva tion, and a fine plantation of poplar trees. {Jones — Morier — MacGregor) MASHlLIH—Lat. Long. Elev.

A river in Kurdistan, crossed 18 miles from Panjwin on the road to Sulimania. At this point it flows due north between high, but not • verv steep, wooded mountains, with a few villages on slopes in the , . distance. It is also called the Yahara and Bimansuchai. {Gerard.)467 30 a MAS—MAY mashrikAn— A name used sometimes for the one branch, sometimes for another, of the Gargar river in Khuzistan. Schindler says that one Edrisi, after saying that the Mashrikan was to the westward of Shustar, speaks of a Mashrikan district with many date palms, being passed before getting to Askar Makram, Mash rikan being a large and populous district, lying between, and on, both branches; it is natural to suppose that the rivers would be called the Ab-i-Mashrikan, simply because they came from Mashrikan, or be cause Mashrikan was situated on both of them, just as at the present day the Gargar and Shatait are indiscriminately called the Ab-i-Shus- tar because they come from a pass by that town. {ScJdndler.) MASHHfjR—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Khuzistan, half-way between Hindian and Dorak in the midst of the desert and 2 miles from the sea. It is, notwithstand ing its position, tolerably supplied with good water from a number of wells immediately without the walls near the gate.

A village in Ears, 60 miles from Shiraz, and 31 from Persepolis, situated on a plain, surrounded by mountains. It was the scene of the celebrated and desperate attack of Lutf 'All Khan, Zand, on the camp of Agha Muhammad Kajar, the story of which is so graphically told by Malcolm. Feeling that he ought to make one great and last struggle for the throne of Persia, Lutf J Ali, with a few hundred men, surprised Agha Muhammad's army, 30,000 strong, and succeeded in putting a number to flight, and throwing all into great confusion, though he had eventually to fly to prevent himself being taken prisoner.

There is a considerable and excellent spring here, which gushes out in streams springing from the face of a precipitous cliff, and, flowing across the plains, causes, at some 2 or 3 miles distance, a marshy lake. The sarai is a good one, recently built and in excel lent order, and situated in a commanding position on a natural terrace, some 200 to 300 yards square. Felly thinks Mian-i-Kotal is the first point on the road from Bushahr where the climate can be considered such as would suit the European constitution during the hot season. There is no village near this, nor are any supplies obtainable unless a little straw, but the earavansarai would contain 500 men, and there is camping-ground for 500 more on the plateau. The surrounding hills are covered with open forest, so fuel would be procurable. [Taylor — St. John — Clerk — Hardy — Felly.)469 MIA—MIR MlAN-I-Kt}H—Lat. Long. Elev.

A town in Khuzistan, situated on the north bank of the Hafar canal, 26 miles below Basra. It is surrounded by a wall, which is in a ruined state and crumbling away in many parts. The defences consist of some square and round towers, which are neither loop-holed, crenelated, nor pierced with embrasures. These towers are connected together by a curtain about 20 feet high, which sur rounds the town on the north-east and west faces. The towers also are about 20 feet in height and of a diameter of about 10 feet. They consist of a parapet of about 3 feet thick all round. There are two gateways, one on the east, and one on the west face. The fort is surrounded on the north, east, and west sides by a nala from 5 to 10 feet deep by 10 to 12 feet broad, filled with water at the high tides. The town is capable of holding upwards of a thousand men, but is in a very dirty state, and would require a thorough cleansing before it would be safe to quarter any one accustomed to cleanly habits in it. The streets are narrow. The bazar, which is covered, is one of the best buildings in the town. The houses are generally built of sun- dried bricks, and ruinous, while the streets are filthy beyond descrip tion. The population is about 3,000. Its trade with Shustar and Ahwaz, once considerable, has ceased with the decay of those places and the disuse of the Karun river as a trade route. It is still the market for dates, grain, and wool, produced in the neighbouring dis trict, and supplies the Arabs with calico, coffee, and sugar. In 1870 the Shah ordered the construction of fortifications round the town, and a mud wall, 12 feet in height and 2 feet in thickness, was built. Rain and wind have, however, made large and numerous breaches in it. ...... In 1879 the post was brought into telegraphic communication with the capital. # . When the British attacked Muhammarah in 1857, the fortifications round about it consisted of nine batteries erected by the Persian army : four of these were on the mainland and five on the island of Abadan; almost all these apparently having been newly constructed. The north fort on the point west of Muhammarah was one of the best, and this was the one with which our men-of-war were principally engaged. It consisted (as did all the others) of a well constructed parapet, made of layers of date leaves and clay, well rammed and bound together.MUH—MUH 472 This battery had nine embrasures. The others had from five to three each. These embrasures, were constructed, at their mouths, of date- tree 'trunks, fastened together. Most of the batteries were open at the o-orge, the ground in the interior being covered with pits dug as shell traps. With the exception of these, there are no other defences near Muhammarah. The water at Muhammarah is, of course, plentiful and very good from the rivers, but is not to be obtained from wells, as the water found in them is salt and brackish. A well was dug by our Sappers in 1856 at about a mile inland, and no water was procured till the well had attained a depth of 23 feet, when a very little was found, and that was undrinkable and brackish ; water is also to be obtained from the various cuts and but doubts are entertained as to its whole someness, owing to its flowing through the date groves, where vege table matter grows thickly on its banks. The water from the Bahr-ul-mashir, or Hafar, should be always pro cured, if possible, for drinking, being supposed to be much more whole some than that of the Shatt-ul-Arab, and the creek or irrigation water should be avoided, being impregnated with the foul vegetable matter through which it passes. General Williams, in his report to Government, dated 23rd October 1856, says :—“ The climate of Muhammarah from June to October is very deadly to Europeans, but during the remainder of the year it is well adapted to the operations of war.-” Sir Henry Rawlinson agrees in this estimate, saying the climate “ is so pestilential that the mortal ity among those who are obliged from any cause to reside in it during the hot season amounts to about 50 per cent. The cause of this un healthiness is the marsh malaria produced by the decomposition of vegetable matters under a burning sun, added to the great humidity of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the sea.” Captain Holland remarks on the salubrity of Muhammarah as fol- l ows ; —“ Accounts seem so contradictory as to the salubrity or other wise of the climate during the hot season that it would be impossible to form an opinion without personal experience. During the period the army have been encamped here, viz., the month of April 1857, it was very healthy, the sick of the force averaging only from 2 to 3 per cent. The thermometer during the heat of the day ranged from 75° to 93°. The soil seems to retain moisture from the contiuued decomposition of both animal and vegetable matter, as in the Indus and Nile and all deltas formed by deposits from rivers. The miasma arising from such a soil in the hot season alone would be sufficient cause for fever. All accounts seem to coincide as regards the salubrity of the place during the cold season, viz., from the beginning of Octo ber to the end of March.” Captain Selby, however, entertains a different opinion from the rest of our authorities regarding the salubrity of this place. “ Besides,” he says,—“ the advantages which Muhammarah, considered either as a military post or commercial city, possesses, its great salubrity is of vast importance in a country so low and flat as the delta of the Euphrates; and I am enabled, from a personal knowledge of it forMUH—MUH 473 some years, to bear witness to its superiority in this respect over any other part of the adjacent country, so much so that when during the hot months duty called me from Baghdad to the town of Basra or its vicinity, I invariably remained at or near Muhammarah, to which, in a great measure, I attribute the entire absence of that deadly fever which committed such havoc in the second expedition, under Captain Lynch, at its outset, and which can only be ascribed to its having been com pelled to remain so long at Basra. I may further adduce as a proof that during the fifteen months I commanded the steamers Euphrates and Assyria, I only lost two men,—one from an accident, the other in consequence of a chronic disease of seven years' standing.' The country adjoining Muhammarah,boundedon the east by the Bahr- ul-mashlr, on the west by the Shatt-ul-Arab, and on the south by the Hafar, is for miles a low plain, no high ground being within sight of Mu hammarah. The soil is an alluvial depositand chiefly consists of clay. On the banks of the rivers and for about three-quarters of a mile inland, the ground is intersected by deep cuts, which are filled with water at the rise of the tides : almost all those on the western side, when so filled, are impassable, unless bridged over. These cuts are surrounded by date- trees, groves of which run along the banks of the rivers and extend inland as far as the cuts. These trees are seldom less than fi*om 7 to 8 yards apart from each other. The ground here in many parts is covered with rank vegetation, amongst which grows the liquorice plant, which seems indigenous to the country. Further inland, beyond the belt of the groves, there seems to be no vegetation whatever, the ground being one continued plain, intersected, by a nala of from 50 to 15 feet broad by 15 to 10 feet deep. This extends right across the plain, and joins the Shatt-ul-Arab with the Karun. At low tides it is passable in one or two places. The open country is of course well adapted for the operations of cavalry and artillery, and even in the groves. All arms could advance inland with great facility, provided they proceed in a direction parallel to the cuts and had not to cross the large connecting nala abovementioned. However this, as well as all other cuts, could be bridged over by trunks of the date-trees, which grow on either side, being cut down and laid across. The banks of this nala are com posed of a soil of thick adhesive clay. The productions of the country seem to be barley, lucerne-grass, onions, beans, dates, &amp;c. Poultry and bullocks are obtainable to an ordinary extent, but the latter are of an inferior quality. Eggs, butter, and milk are to be procured in small quantities from Sirkhana and the other small villages near Muhammarah. The river Shatt-ul-Arab is here of about half a mile in width, and of sufficient depth to float the largest ships, and to allow them to be alongside the bank, which is perpendicular and composed of adhesive clay. The Hafar and Bahr-ul-mashir are nearly as deep, small vessels being able to lie longside their banks. The rivers are of course impas sable, except in boats or rafts, the only material at hand for construct ing the latter being trunks of date-trees, which, owing to the heaviness of the wood, are not very buoyant. The natives made much use of a raft composed of inflated skins with a flooring of date branches tiedMUH—MUH 474 together ; such rafts could be easily constructed of any size. Boats are not procurable in great numbers, some small and large canoes and fouo'O'alows being all that are obtainable. The boatmen seem willing to let their boats out on hire, and are a hard-working class of men. It is said that this part of the country is under water at the season when the snows melt; this, however, seems impossible, as there is a oradual rise of ground from the Hafar inland of about one in every two hundred feet. Some of the Arabs say that the ground at and near the date groves is alone inundated during that season, further inland being dry. The camp of the second division of the British-Persian Expeditionary Force was pitched in 1857 on the open ground, at a distance of about 1 300 yards south of the great ndld which connects the Shatt-ul-Arab and Karun, facing the north, the prevailing winds being east and west. The district of Muhammarah originally formed part of the Dorak chieftainship, but the present Shaikh of Muhammarah separated his clan, fostered the natural excellent position of his fort for commerce, and has since remained at feud with his old chief. The estimated population of the district is about 45,000, and the revenue 33,000 tumans. The district was Turkish territory until about forty years ago, when the great plague enfeebled the Pashaliks of Baghdad and Basra, and the Persians quietly took possession of it. Five of the principal tribes of Khuzistan, i.e., Muhaisin, Bawiyah, Daris, Humaid, Nasara, numbering in all about 15,000 adult males, are tributary to Muhammarah. [Bawlinson — Williams — Selby — Holland—Robertson Telly Boss.) Bell (24th March 1885) writes— “ Its population is about 2,000 (300 families). The best and driest encamping-ground is the vacant space within the walls. The town occupies but a small part of the walled enclosure, which is from | to 1 mile long each way; the wall, 10 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base, is surrounded by a narrow and shallow moat. Flanks project at every 100 yards ; at each angle are flanks of considerable size. “A mile up the Shatt-ul-Arab lives Shaikh Mizal Khan, younger son of the late Haji Jabir Khan, Chief of Muhammarah and of the Arab tribes in the vicinity. He is well affected towards the British, a par tiality which is known to his Persian masters. His elder brother lives at Isfahan, and there intrigues against him. His residence is a com modious one, built on the left bank of the river at a point where a creek runs inland. . It is the object of every man in Persia to attract little or no observa tion to his power and wealth. On this account Shaikh Mizal is said to look with disfavour on the opening of the Karun to traffic, it being likely to largely increase the wealth of himself and his Arab tribes, and to develop the resources of the country over which he rules—a prosperity likely to produce envy and his downfall. Lieutenant Selby, after a careful survey of the river, pointed out475 MUH—MUK that the advantages of the situation of Muhammarah are that the Karun lies to its north-east; the Shatt-ul-Arab to its south-west; its inhabitants (Arabs) are more active and less bigoted than the Turks ; its situation is more salubrious than that of Basra ; and its waters (Karun) cool and invigorating. In our hands he considered that it would become the emporium of trade between Armenia, Arabia, Persia, and India. Persia derives no benefit from the port; political reasons cause her practically to close it to commerce. MUHR—Lat. Long. Elev.

(Morier — Clerk) [N.B .—This is probably the same as Mashhad-i-Murghab.] Mr. Odling, M.R.C.S., writes— t( From Murghab to Surmek, which is situated on the edge of the 476477 MUR-MUZ Abadih plain, the road leads up and down mountains and through valleys. The population is sparse, and a great part of the country barren, or only affords grazing for goats and camels. The climate here is much more bracing than at Shiraz, though it is not wise to travel in the middle of the day during the hot months: even at this season the nights are generally cool. The winter is severe, snow often lying on the ground for months together. Intermittent fever only occasionally occurs. Dyspepsia, diarrhoea and ophthalmia are the most common diseases.

This has hitherto been called by English sea men the Bardistan bank. The shoal appears to be composed of sand, with a rocky foundation. Its edge is one-third of a mile out side Umm-Khailah, or 6| miles off the mainland, and to the south east this distance increases to 8 miles. Inside the shoal a deep-water channel, or khor, runs up between Umm-Khailah and the mainland, and continues for 8 miles beyond that island, but has no outlet. It is called Khor Aiyaz (?). Vessels can anchor off the tail of Ras Mutaf, quite sheltered from the “shimal.” As there is no shelter from a shimal between this and Bushahr, and it is a convenient and acces sible place for anchorage, it may be advantageously resorted to by vessels caught in a north-west gale near this port.

It is built just at the foot of the north-east range of hills upon some craggy points. In the centre of the town rises the citadel, a most imposing-looking structure and really of some strength. It crowns the top of the highest of the craggy points on which the place is built, and is supported by an immensely solid mud wall from without, rising at least 100 feet high. Nahavand is celebrated as the scene of the great battle in 641, which gave the Persian Empire to the Arabs. Since Shah Abbas retook this place from the Turks in 1602, it has been gradually falling into decay, and has now only a thousand houses. 150 Jewish families live in the town. They are better treated here than elsewhere in Persia. The town contains 7 quarters, 12 mosques, 2 high and 11 lower schools, 7 public baths and 2 bazars, with about 300 shops. The main trade is in country woollen materials. Water is plentiful and there are fine gardens. The district forms the basis for a regular regiment. [Ferrier — Schindler.) NAHR BUSI—Lat. Long. Elev.

A town in the district of Yazd, 268 miles from Tihran, on the road to Yazd, from which it is 80 miles distant. It is 93 miles east of Isfahan. Nam is a small town, rather less than a mile in circumference, enclosed by a dilapidated wall and ruinous ditch, and entered by five gateways. It is situated on an uneven part of a great plain, a short distance south of some mountains which intersect the flat country at this part. With the exception of some trifling patches of cultivation and a few gardens of fruit-trees, the environs appear perfectly sterile, and the aspect of the place is rendered still more wretched by the ruins of mud walls which surround it. It possesses a small bazar of soire seventy or eighty miserable shops, in which petty trades are carried on, such as smiths, dyers, makers of felt, cotton-beaters, &amp;e., and one shop in which Manchester goods are sold. The place contains nothing else worth remarking, unless it be the prin cipal mosque, which is built on an unusual plan, and contains an ancient pulpit bearing the date 721 A.H. A ruined mud fort stands within the town, which latter possesses some 400 or 500 houses, and a population estimated at 5,000. Its in habitants speak a dialect of their own, which is said to be the ancient language of the Gabrs, who occupied this place at one time. Nam is the^principal place in a district extending from south-east to north west about 54 miles, and from north-east to south-west about 77 miles, in which space there appear to be eight villages and some three hundred hamlets. Many of the latter are tenanted each by a very few families. The productions of the district consist of barley, wheat, cotton, all in trifling quantities, and fruits, such as melons, grapes, and pomegranates. The revenue of this part of the country is taken according to an estimate of the value of the water in the villages or lands. This reve nue is called f banichah/ and is of ancient custom, and amounts to only 1,605 tumans—a miserable sum to be derived from so large a tract of country ; but the district, owing to the scarcity of water, is not a fertile one, and it is much exposed to the forages of Bakhtiarls. The old fort is described as being in the middle of the town on a mound of clay. Its central portion, or citadel, stands some sixty feet above the level of the town. The main fort has many old towers, some vaulted chambers under the citadel, and dry wells. A wall with towers surroundsNAI—NAJ the whole. The fort is a mere ruin now. The principal mosque of Nam has also the reputation of great antiquity, and this is borne out to some extent by its style. Three sides of the square have cloisters consisting of a double row of arches, behind which are vaulted rooms. The fourth side has a single row only. The material is brick and the style heavy, square, and solid. The minaret is 80 feet high, built of unbaked bricks, with a corridor gallery round the top. Nain lies low, compact, within the irregular outline of its wall. Many roads diverge from it, and give it importance, viz., to Isfahan, Kashan, Yazd, Samnan, Damghan, Biabanak, and Tabas. (AT.

Elev. 5,200'. A town in Ears, 125 miles east of Shiraz, 7 miles from the south-east point of lake of Nairiz. It is a poor town, containing about 1,500 families, including those of its three adjacent forts. It occupies a considerable space, with its gardens and houses, in a corner of the plain near mountains. Its bazaar possesses forty or fifty shops and three caravansarais, but the former are of the meanest description. Though this place is on the high road from Shiraz to Karman, the traffic between the two places is very limited. The district of Nairiz extends about 30 miles east of the town. The productions are much the same as those generally of other parts of Persia, namely, gram, millet, cotton, tobacco, and palma christi, but not in great quantities, there being a scarcity of water ; the plain is, therefore, little cultivated. Fruits, however, are abundant and cheap. Lead mines are found in its hills. {K. Abbott) Nairiz contains about 3,500 houses. (Lovett) Wells says (3rd May 1881) that it is a picturesque little town with its gardens and large walnut trees, showing above the sea of poppy heads which form the fore-ground.

NESTO RIANS— _ A tribe of Christians who inhabit the district of Urmia in Azarbaijan, Persia, and the mountains to the south of it. The following particulars regarding this interesting people are gleaned from Colonel ShiePs notes and Herr Wagner's book :—“The origin of the name Nestorians is not very clear. Though acquainted with the word “ Nestooree,” it is rejected by this people, who disavow Nestorius; and it is said that the word intended to be used is “Nes- serani,” a common expression over the East for Christians, and derived from Nazareth. KaldanI is the name, he said, of this nation and language, the latter bearing a strong resemblance to Syriac and much affinity with Arabic. Mar Shimoon (Great Simon) is the name of the Chief or Patriarch, who lives at Kojamis, near Joolamerk, in the heart of the mountains. Great Simon must be a very great man, all Christians who belong chiefly to the mountain districts of ToqubI and Tiari paying respect to him. There are conflicting opinions respecting the character of these Nestorians. In the highlands of Kurdistan they are wild, brave, and grasping ; in fact, they resemble the Kurds, amongst whom, in many places, they live intermingled. The breeding of cattle is their prin cipal occupation. In the plain of Urmia, on the other hand, they are farmers, and have adopted, under Persian sway, both the cowardly, servile, lying, and deceptive character, together with the polished and insinuating manners of the Persians. Shiel, who was on one occasion present during the religious ser vice of this people, thus describes it:— “We then proceeded to the church, and by a door 3 feet in height (these small dimensions being, no doubt, intended for security, we entered a dark room, 20 feet square, the floor of which was covered with a few pieces of matting. There were three brick structures, which seemed to be altars, for on them books were placed, and in one corner lay a large bundle of firewood. il The service was simple enough. The bishop had a single attendant, who, I suppose, was a priest, and not at all a reputable-looking son of the church. The bishop was not decked in vestments of clerical garments of any kind; and the priest put on only a white band round his neck, with another round his waist, ornamented with a cross. On the middle485 NES—NES altar there was a lamp burning ; and during prayers a vessel containing very strong incense was occasionally swung. They applied it to the books on the altar (the Scriptures, no doubt), to a figure of the cross, the bishop’s beard, the priest’s face, then to mine, to the great discomfiture of my nose and eyes, and then a small dose was adminis tered to the rest of the congregation, when it arrived. The bishop and priest sang and chaunted alternately. They remained in a standing position, excepting when they read the Bible, when they sat. Their mode of reading the Scripture resembled the monotonous, though far from unpleasing, recitative intonation used in reading the Kuran. From the near connexion of Arabic and Kaldani, and from the apparent metrical division of the verses, it also bore a strong similarity to the Kuran. For a long time I and my two Mussalman servants formed the entire congregation. The priest appeared to get ashamed of so scanty an attendance, for a boy, peeping in at the door, was apparently sent to collect an audience, which soon after appeared, represented by half a dozen men and a few women. The men kissed the bishop’s hand, mine, and that of the priest more than once. The behaviour of the khalifa was tolerably respectful. The priest, who was constantly yawning, seemed heartily tired of his occupation, and was continually talking in a most irreverent manner to the congregation, who imitated his example. In the church there was not a single picture or image, and in answer to my enquiry, they said such things were never permitted by their religion.” The following account of the religious condition of these people is given by the Revd. Mr. Dwight and the Revd. Mr. Smith, two American Missionaries who preceded Dr. Grant and the Revd. Mr. Perkins in their researches at Urmia, and who complained of the difficulty they experienced in arriving at a conclusive opinion on this subject :—“ The Nestorians positively recognize the divinity and humanity of Christ in one person, but the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone. There are seven sacraments,—baptism, eucharist, ordin ation, marriage, burial, confirmation, confession, but not auricular confession, which some of them say is found in their ancient books, but is not now practised. The laity take the bread and the wine at communion ; the elements ceased to be bread and wine after consecra tion ; transubstantiation takes place, and a sacrifice is offered up in the mass. They fast abundantly, and eat no animal food at such periods. They abstain from labour on festivals, and celebrate the feast of the Assumption, but they hesitate to recognize the fact. They read the Scripture a good deal : the canonical books are the same as in the Catholic Church. The church service is not understood by the people at large, being in Estrangelo, or old Syriac; but there are translations for their use. They pray to the saints, and regard them as mediators. Hell is eternal. Masses and prayers are said for the dead ; but purgatory is denied. Bishops cannot marry or eat meat : the clergy may marry, but those who do so are not eligible as bishops. There are monasteries for monks, and convents for nuns, who take vows of celibacy, seclusion, &amp;c. They offer sacrifices of animals to remove sickness.486 NES—NES “ When a man intends to have a son a khalifa, for three years before the birth of the prospective bishop, his mother must abstain from flesh of every description. If, instead of a son, a daughter is bora, the latter neither eats meat nor marries during her life. The khalifaship seems to be confined to families. A khalifa, for instance, dies ; his brother or sister sets about producing another, should the defunct bishop have no nephews.” “ In 1818,” says Wagner, “an American Mission was established under Dr. Grant of the New England Independent Church. The American Missionaries received immediately a hearty welcome from the Nestorians, because they saw that these foreigners would be a useful bulwark against the tyranny of the Persian grandees, that their reports, forwarded to Tabriz and Tihran would have weight, and that they would benefit them as protectors or, at all events, mediators in cases of extortion. Meanwhile, the missionaries showered their gold with a liberal hand, and not only taught the youth gratis, but gave them a weekly gratuity. They did not interfere with the liturgy in external devotions of the Nestorians, nor sought to effect any change in their religious ceremonies; they testified their respect for the historical character of Nestorians, of whom the clergy knew little and the people nothing, and they made friends of the high and low clergy by liberal donations. “ The American Mission cannot boast of splendid results in relation to the improvement of morality, stimulus by virtuous examples, or the advancement of culture. Of all the exertions of the missionaries, their gratuitous instruction of the young is least appreciated. Each bishop receives from the Americans a monthly allowance of 800 Turkish piastres, and ordinary ecclesiastics from 150 to 200 piastres. On the condition of this allowance being continued, the Nestorian clergy permit the missionaries to preach in their villages, to keep schools, and to interpret to the youth the principles of Christian morality, which are neither taught nor practised by the native clergy. Without this payment or bribery of the priests for a good end, the missionaries could not maintain their footing in this country. Even the peasant is only carrying on a pecuniary speculation in sending his child to school. Each scholar receives weekly a sdhebgeran, and, though this gift is small, the schools would become directly empty, if it were to cease. The institution at fjrmia costs the North American Missionary societies above fifty thousand dollars annually, and the maintenance of the other missions in Turkey three times that amount. Yet, if we except a few Jews, won over from motives of gain, these expensive establishments have made no converts. “ Dr. Grant’s efforts roused those of the Church of Rome. The Kaldanis, or Chaldseans, are divided into two religions—the one of the Nestorian faith, the other of the Church of Rome. The former are numerous in the valley of Grmia, am &gt;unting to perhaps 400 families; while the Catholics are few. But in the adjoining district of Salmas, between Grmia and Khol, the Catholic Kaldanis are a considerable body. When the American establishment in Grmia became kfiownTS7 NES—NES the Propaganda at Rome felt alarm at the danger to which its flock was exposed; and though some of the priests at Salmas had been educated at Rome, it was considered that European energy only could stem the torrent from the Western Hemisphere. Some French Lazarist Missionaries were despatched to the rescue in the persons of Pere Cluzel, Pere Darnis, and one or two others. These gentlemen abounded in zeal and activity, but they were poor, and wholly unable to contend against the treasures of Boston and the paraphernalia which gave so much brilliancy to the operations emanating from tJrmia. It was as much as they could do to hold their own ground, and preserve their flock from the invaders. As might be surmised, dissensions followed. There were accusations and recriminations. “ The French Missionaries had, in fact, a narrow escape of expulsion through the hostility of the Russian Government, which even proceeded to the length of extorting a firman from the late Shah, prohibiting Christians from changing their religion. The intention was to prevent conversion among the Armenians to other creeds—Catholic, Protestant, or Nestorian. The Patriarch of the Armenians of that part of the world being a resident in Russia, the Emperor perhaps considered him self in a measure the head of that church. When Muhammad Shah died, the Persian Government was persuaded to revoke that obnoxious edict, and Christians were again free to choose their own faith.” Most authorities appear to have been unanimous in regarding the country of the Chahlseans as quite unassailable, but their opinions would seem to have been founded on the stories of the people them selves who were fond of boasting that no enemy had dated to invade their mountains. Unfortunately recent events have not confiimed these anticipations. The chieftain of a Kurdish tribe has effected what Muhammad and Omar never accomplished, perhaps because they did not think it worth the trouble. Nurula Bey, chief of the Hakan Kurds, had long lusted after the rich booty of the Christians m the Upper Zheb valleys. Though these people were poor in comparison with the inhabitants of large cities and fertile plains, yet they had a goodly property, and especially fine herds of cattle, a sufficient attraction for a Kurdish robber prince. Dr. Grant, who was aware of the project of the Kurdish chiettam, strove to avert the calamity. Peace-making or mediation is a noble office worthy of the Christian Missionary, and the journey of Dr. Grant, through the most unruly Kurdish tribes, to the residence of Beda/Khan, in order to prevent a fearful massacre, redounds more to his honour than all his researches about the lost tribes of Israel. Bedar Kban received him courteously, smoked the tchibouk with him, and ate out of the same dish with him. The Nestorians said on this occasion that the “ lamb had dined with the lion.” But the eloquence of the apostle of peace was not able to damp the fanaticism of Bedar Khan, the revenge of Nurula Bey who had a feud with the Nestorian Patriarchy, or the thirst for plunder shared with them by Muhammad Khan from Lake Van, their third colleague. The band of Nuiula Bey began their attack in the district ot Diz, where the Patriarch then resided. Though, the Nestonans had long488 been aware of the intentions of the Kurds, they allowed themselves to be surprised, and made but slight resistance. The Patriarch only thought of his own safety and ran away, leaving his mother and bro thers to be butchered, with thousands of other Nestorians, in the cruellest manner. The smoke of the burning villages eddied up over the Snowy Mountains, and the screams of injured women were mingled with the shouts of the victorious Kurds. Neither the helplessness of age, nor the innocence of childhood, found any mercy. Almost half the Tiarl fell in the massacre. Part of the survivors fled to Persia : many thousands remained as prisoners in the hands of the Kurds. The village of Sespatoi was the only place that offered a heroic and a des perate resistance, and all, save five or six who escaped into the steepest fastnesses, fell defending themselves. When nothing more remained to be destroyed, the murderers and plunderers retired with their captives and booty, many of the boys being circumcised and forcibly converted to Islam. Thus this remarkable Alpine republic came to an end, and it is not probable it will ever recover, for the Nestorians will never lose the memory of their awful defeat or the Kurds of their triumph. Dr. Grant estimates the whole of the Kaldani nation, Catholic and Nestorian, in Persia, Kurdistan, and Turkey at about 200,000 souls. Dr. Grant says the word Kaldani is usually applied to the Catholics of this tribe, while the others are called Nestorians. This is contrary to Colonel ShiePs opinion, who says the whole nation is called Kaldani and the divisions are Nestorian and Catholic. [Wagner — Shiel — Grant.) NID—Lat. &gt; Long. _ _ Elev.

The name signifies the “ Bridge of the Chasm,” and it is a most remarkable spot; the broad stream of the Karkhah, in general about 80 or 100 yards wide, here, for the space of 300 paces, forces its way through a narrow chasm, which a bold cragsman may spring across with ease. Indeed, Rawlinson mentions having seen a Kurd do so, though it was rather nervous to look at him, for the crags are very slippery, and had he missed his footing, he must have been dashed to pieces. The cleft is now about &amp; 159 feet in depth; the sides are honeycombed in the most fantastic manner, as though the chasm had been gradually worn down in the rock by the action of the water, and the river boils and foams below, in its narrow bed, as we might fancy Styx or Phlegethon did. A little arch has been thrown across the cleft, which forms the great thoroughfare for the Lurl nomads in their passage between their summer pastures near Khuramabad and the warm places beyond tlie Karkhah, where they encamp in the winter. It is believed to have been by this bridge that Antigonus passed the Karkhah in his memorable retreat froin Badaca across the mountains into Media. The bridge is 98 miles south of Khuramabad.

Name of a plain in Ears, to west of Persepolis. {Durand.) RAM HURMUZ—Lat. . Long. Elev. A plain in Khuzistan, south-east of Shustar, on the banks of the Jaiahi river. This plain is inhabited by the following tribes, who are partly nomadic and partly stationary : 'All Khamis, 'All Bu-Kura, Shuli, 'All Bu Murad, and Gurgi. The plain has a flourishing ap pearance. The south part of the district is constantly exposed to the forays of the Kuhgehlu. The principal villages on the plain of Ram Hurmuz,Dih Yar,Kala Shaikh, Sultanabad, Jaizan, 'Ali-abad, Kherfend, Jaizan, and Chah Mula. The annual tribute claimed from Ram Hurmuz was, until lately, 3,000 tumans. There are naphtha springs near it. Beyond the Zaitun range is the fertile plain of Ram Hurmuz, which extends to the river Karun, from a low range of hills running at right angles with this great chain, joining the Zaitun hills and forming the boundary between Ram Hurmuz and the plain of Bihbahan. The plain has a rich alluvial soil, suited to grains of all kinds and to rice, fruit trees, dates, &amp;c. Here are the remains of numerous villages and frequent assemblages of mounds, and remains of large canals, marking the seat of an overflowing ancient population. To the east of Ram Hurmuz is a range of sandstone and limestone hills, abounding in gypsum, and containing the celebrated white naphtha springs and bitumen pits of Ma-i-Daud. Ram Hurmuz itself must have been, from its appearance, a great city once. Its position at a point where several rivers meet, and at the foot of a gorge leading through the mountains to Shiraz, makes it naturally a place of importance, but it is little more now than a market for the Bedouin tribes and a military station. The position 498 iHAM—EAS of the Arabs here is a miserable one. At war with the Shirazls who infest the hills to the east and pillaged by a government who does nothing to protect them, they still cling to their little bits of cultivation near the hills. They are half the year nomadic, going south and west with their flocks; but in the spring return to the hills, plough up a few acres, and gather in a crop, if possible, before the tax- gatherer has found them out. The Persian Government is weak, and the garrison of Earn Hurmuz is generally only sufficient for its duty of holding the town, but every now and then a re-inforcement arrives from Ahwaz or Fellahlah and then a raid is made under pretext of collection of arrears, and horses and cattle are driven off in payment. This is the plan throughout the district. The estimated population is 7,000, and the revenue 9,000 tumans. [Layard—Lady Anne Blunt — Ross.) RAMIS—Lat. Long. Elev.

A course now south by east will take you fairly down to the line of 10 fathoms on the Bardis- tan bank, which should be crossed, in this depth. “ If a beating wind, you should not stand off into more than 28 fathoms; and in shore, at night, into less than 8 fathoms, unless above the Asses' Ears, in which case you may stand into 5 or 6 fathoms ; in the day-time you may opproach the shore to 4 fathoms, being to the southward of the Asses' Ears.

To the south of Bandar Rig, and immediately north of the Bushahr creek, lies a flat corn-growing circle of some ten Arab villages, known as Rohilla; indeed, it may be remarked that, coming southward from the Cbab territories, the plain, there wholly pastoral, becomes gra dually patched with corn, until, towards Rohilla, large breadths are found under the plough. A fresh-water stream, fordable only in one or two places, runs through this district, which none the less depends solely on rain. It is traditioned that this Rohilla, or Rud- halla river received a portion of the waters turned by the earthquake fron/the Kalll river of Ganawah, the remainder of that stream having burst northward towards Bihbahan, and found its exit in the Hin- dian in an affluent of that river, meeting it near Zaitun, and m the southernmost tributary of the Jarahi. The outlet on the sea for . theROH—ftUD produce is at Sbiaf {q.v.), a small port on the northern shore of the Bushahr creek, about 3 miles distant from the nearest village of this circle. The corn of this district, being dependent on an uncertain and scant rainfall, is sparsely sown, broadcast, and care lessly ploughed in with the old scratch ; but there is little doubt that, under proper management of water, and free of restriction and unequal taxation, the country here might export corn and cotton to a consider able quantity. This district rears a good half-breed description of horse, half Persian, half Arab; they pass currently under the general name of the Chab Arab horse. The principal defects of this half-breed are found in a small arm and a falling-off in the hind quarter. They are better roadsters than the pure Arab, but they lack his quietness, intelligence, and endurance. By recrossing the Rohilla Chab with a pure Arab, it is found that a good-looking serviceable horse of large bone and height, is obtained, but he is never as serviceable as the pure Arab.

A ruined village in Northern Kurdistan, ‘20 miles east of llaiat, on the road to Khelisisa and Suj Bulak. {Gerard.) SHIRAZ—Lat. 29° 37' 56'. Long. 52° 40' 22'. Elev. 4,850'.* A city, the capital of Ears, 280 miles south south-east of Isfahan, 494 miles south south-east of Tihran, 155 miles north-east of Bushahr by Kazrun (by Eiruzabad, 165 miles). It is situated in the centre of a plain amidst mountains, and is suirounded by rich gardens and vineyards. Its circumference is nearly 4 miles. _ Shiraz is surrounded by a low wall of mud, flanked by semi-circulai towers, which rise some feet above the parapet, and by a dry ditch. The wall has tumbled down in many places and filled up the ditch, so that it is quite easy to ride through the gaps. The southern wall is in tolerable repair. There are no other defences to oppose a besieging force. It has six gates, viz., 1, Isfahan; 2, Bagh-i-Shah; 3, Kazrun, 4, Shah Daulat (?) ; 5, KasbkhanI; 6, Sadi. The city is divided into ten quarters, viz. Darvish Azadah Izliak Beg Bala Kaft MaidanShah . • Suk-at-Tair or Bazar Murgh Sang-I-Siah Sar-i-Duzakh Lab-i-Ab Dar-i-M asjid-i-Nau Sar-i-Bagh Houses. 1,300 1,350 1,200 500 450 750 500 130 180SHI—SHI 528 south-east of the city are in ruins. Those that are habitable are also interspersed with ruins, and of the remaining- space, so much is taken up with bazars, maidans, or squares, the Prince's palace, gardens, stables, and other public buildings, that not one-half of the city is occupied by the inhabitants. There was an opinion in Ouseley's mission, that it could not contain more than 10,000 souls; but if, following Morier's conjecture, 3,800 houses are about its real number, at five souls in each family, we should get a total of 19,000, which is a reasonable calculation. “ The consumption of bread,' says Morier, “ per diem, furnishes better data than the number of houses to calculate the population by an Asiatic town. A year or two ago an investigation was made by Muhammad Nabi Khan into the quantity of corn consumed daily in Shiraz, the ostensible object of which was to ascertain and provide for the annual wants of its population. But the real object was to acquire a positive rate, upon which he might build his plans of monopoly. It was found that Shiraz consumed per diem 8,000 Tabriz mans of wheat, which was made up into 10,000 mans for bread. A Tabriz man is seven pounds and a quarter, English. A Persian eats one cha'rek, or a quarter of a man, every day, then 10,000 Tabriz mans, being equal to 72,500 pounds, the result will be that there are 18,125 souls in the city. “ An old inhabitant of Shiraz nearly corroborated this statement by another account. He told me that seventy yabus, or pack-horses, are daily employed to carry corn from Shiraz to the water mills in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. These horses make two trips during the day, one in the morning, and one in the evening, and at each trip they carry to the mill 60 mans of corn each, which makes the quantity of corn exported from the city amount to 8,400 mans. They calcu late that one man and a quarter of flour produces one man of bread, thus, 8,400 of the former produce 10,500 of the latter; and this will give a population nearly similar, both to the daily consumption, and to any conjecture on the number of houses.' Pelly, however, now esti mates the population at 40,000, living in 6,500 houses.* There are in Shiraz fifteen considerable mosques, besides many others of inferior note, eleven colleges, fourteen bazars, thirteen caravan- sarais, and twenty-six baths. Of all the mosques the Masjid-i-'All (built in the Khilafat of the house of Abbas) is the most ancient, and the Masjid-i-Nau the largest. It was, indeed, originally the palace of Atabeg Shah, who, in a danger ous illness of his son, consulted the Mullas, and was answered (as the only means of the recovery of his child) that “ he must devote to the Almighty that which of all his worldly goods he valued most. He accordingly converted his palace into a mosque, and the Muhammadans add that his son was in consequence restored to health. Stack calls this the most ancient. The Masjid-i-Jama is likewise an ancient struc ture, and there are six others of an older date than the time of Karim * Thomson in Report of 1868 says 25,000. Correspondent of Times of India, 22nd April 1881, says that Mr. Malcolm of Bushahr computes it at 32,000.529 34 SHI—SHI Khan. Of the more modern mosques of Shiraz the Masjid-i-Vahll, the only one built by that Prince, is the most beautiful. Karim Khan began a college here, but never finished it ; there were already six, one of the earliest of which (that founded by Imam Kuli Khan) is still the most frequented. Another was added by Hashim, father of Haji Ibrahim, the Vazlr of Fatah 'All Shah, and the Pish Namaz and Mujtahid (Chief Priest of the city) built another. Of the caravansarais the Kaisarlah Khana, built by Imam Kuli Khan, and now in ruins, is the most ancient. There is another old structure, which was restored from a state of great decay, and assumed the name of its second founder, 'All Khan. There are five others, of which one is called dabbaghan, or the dressers of sheep-skins for caps; another rang-iizan, or dyers; another Hinduan, where the Hindus reside. These were all built before the accession of Karim Khan, a date at which the splendour of Shiraz revived. He added two within the city, and one beyond the walls, and others have since been erected. The same prince enriched his capital with three public baths, two within and one without the town. Four have since been raised, but there were already before his reign nineteen similar foundations. There are several mausoleums * in Shiraz ; the most distinguished of those without the walls is that of Hafiz; there is also beyond the city that of Mir 'All, son of Mlrza Hamza, and grandson of the Imam Musa. A spacious square and extensive, well-built, covered bazars occupy the centre of the town. The latter are built in the form of a cross, and are well supplied with goods imported from India, Constantinople, and Russia, as well as from the west of Europe. The shops display good specimens of work in gold and silver; also copper utensils, rose-water, dried fruits, goat's hair, spices, tobacco, fine linen, and the silk and cotton brocades, for which last this city was celebrated in the time of Ibn Haukal; and there is still a mint in which kirans and the other coins of the province are struck off. The houses of Shiraz are, in general, small, and the streets narrow and filthy. The great bazar, or market place, built by Karim Khan, forms, however, a distinguished exception to this general remark.. It is in length about 500 yards by 120 yards in breadth, made of yellow burnt brick, and arched at the top, having numerous skylights, which, with its doors and windows, always admit sufficient light and air, whilst the sun and rain are completely excluded. This bazar is allotted to the different traders of the city, all of whom have their assigned quarters, which they possess under strict regulations. The roof is vaulted and 22 feet high, and it has a dome at the intersection of the doors. The arch, or citadel, in which the Beglerbeg of Fars resides, is a fortified square of 80 yards. The royal palace within is far from being an elegant structure ; and the pillars of the Dlwan Khana, its * greatest ornament, were removed by Agha Muhammad Khan to adorn his palace at Tihran. * The three most beautiful tombs are (as regards these domes) Shah Chiragh, conspi cuous by its blue dome, Nur Muhammad, and Salad Allah-ud-dln Husain. (Dwrand.)SHI—SHI 530 The praises of Shiraz have been celebrated by many different persons and by Hafiz (the Anacreon of the East), who was a native of this city, and is buried in a small garden, about half a mile from the town. The tomb of the poet was erected by Karim Khan, and is nothing more than a block of white marble in the form of a coffin, on which are inscribed two of his poems and the date of his death. His woiks are not, as has been stated, chained to his tomb; but a splendid copy of them is always kept in an adjoining house. Not far from the tomb of Hafiz is the garden of Jahan Nurna, the most beautiful in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and known, in the time of Karim, by the title of the Vakil's garden.* Its name was changed by Path 'AH Shah, who, when Governor of Ears, built a house in it for a summer residence. He also commenced another on an eminence that commands a beautiful view of the city and its vicinity, which is named Takht-i-Kajar, or the throne of Kajars. Kinneir describes the climate of Shiraz as the finest in the world, and Rich also has a favourable opinion of it, saying :— “ The climate is very agreeable, and is reckoned healthy. The ther mometer is-at 91° for an hour or two, and this only in the hot season. The nights are cool, but it is most pleasant to sleep in the open air, though many keep to their rooms. The praises that have been lavished on this climate have scarcely been exaggerated. The heat of the day is very tolerable, the nights deliciously cool, without being chilly, as the days are not so hot nor the nights so cold; and when the season begins to cool, the days and nights cool together in an equal propor tion. The climate here is exceedingly regular. For days together the temperature is exactly the same to a degree. The usual temperature is 90° at the hottest time, being from 12 till 3; 82° at night, and 71° in the morning, just before the sun appears above the hills. The wind has no tendency to get heated, which is curious, considering the bare rocky mountains by which the plain is surrounded; and all winds are alike agreeable. The winter here is said to be agreeable and much milder than that of Isfahan; but the Persian houses seem but bad winter habitations. The water is excellent here. On the whole, Shiraz is by far the best place in the Gulf for a person to come from India to spend a season; and by landing at Bandar Abbas they would save the unpleasant voyage up the Gulf, and have a good road to Shiraz.' Colonel Hennell, however, is of a different opinion, saying :— “ The climate of Shiraz is, to Europeans especially, most unhealthy, so much so that the spring and summer months would, I doubt not, send two-thirds of any force into hospital, while the mortality would be fearful. In speaking, however, of the insalubrity of Shiraz during the summer months, I must not omit to mention, that from December to April, that place is tolerably healthy, although exceedingly cold, even to Europeans.' * Other gardens are, Bagh-i-takht, Bagh-i-nau, Dilkusha. These are going to ruin with the exception of Dilkusha, which is private property, and has lately been repaired. But all have a dilapidated and passe look. {Durand.)SHI—SHI Beyond the plain in which Shiraz is situated rise the dark bare mountains, snow-crowned. Stack considers the most remarkable relics of antiquity near Shiraz to be three wells on a rocky hill, 2 miles north-east of the city. No one knows who made them. Probably they are older than the Muhammadan conquest. The hill is about 500 feet high, and very steep. It seems to be composed of sandstone and limestone. Two of the wells are on the side facing the city. These are the deepest. The mouth of the larger of the two is about 7 feet by 5, and its depth nearly 500 feet. The shaft evi dently sinks through the whole depth of the hill. It is hewn in the solid limestone and very smoothly cut ; the sides are perfectly plump. The third well at the back of the hill has seats, or ledges, cut in the rock above it. Remains of old fortifications encompass the summit of the hill. From the topmost peak the whole plain of Shiraz can be seen, and the salt lake of Mahalu 20 miles to the east. The plain is well watered, fertile, and green, and miles of orchards cover its western end. Shiraz city is a compact area in the landscape, overhung with smoke, and adorned by three blue domes. The articles of manufacture and commerce in Shiraz are arms, cutlery, glassware, ornamental pencases, silver and gold pipes, tobacco pipes, cotton cloths, cotton and woollen stockings, and wine. The wine of Shiraz is freely made and sold publicly by the Arme nians. It is of two kinds, red and white. The former tastes like rough and coarse sherry, and the latter like a moist thin chablis. It is kept in large jars and sold in glass bottles of various sizes, holding from a quart to two or three gallons. The manufacture of these bottles gives employment to a large number of people. An extensive branch of industry is the making of Kaliuns, some of which are very beautifully worked in the precious metals. The bowls are generally formed of a cocoanut, the more costly de scription mounted with silver and gold. The prices vary from Is. to £30. The Kaliun supersedes the pipe in Persia. The tobacco grown in the neighbourhood of Prinj is of good quality. The art of enamelling also is practised here to some extent, and sham articles of jewellery, the execution of which is very delicate. The metals used are silver and gold. Carpets used formerly to be made at Shiraz, but of late years the manufacture has declined, and now only those of a coarse texture are manufactured. The yield of crops in the Shiraz plain for 1879-80 is estimated at 20,000 shah mans, equal to 1,300 cases. Ross, in his Report for 1879-80, gives a memorandum on the cultivation of a village in one of the subdivisions of Shiraz. Besides Karind, Shiraz is the chief locality where native cutlery can be procured. Although Shiraz is a trade name given to fine tobacco, it is not much grown there. In regard to communication with the sea at Bushahr, although only 190 miles intervene, six severe passes have to be surmounted, and at two spots the track rises to an altitude of 7,000 feet, and on this 538539 SHI—SHI subject the reader is referred to the Route-book and to Mr. Mackenzie's Memorandum of March 1883 and Wells of 1882. {Durand.) The following observations (March 1885) by Mr. Odling, M.It.C.S., regarding Shiraz and district are very useful from a sanitary point of view:— “ From Dasht-i-Arjan to Khana-i-Zanian the road first leads over a mountain range; on this good water is procurable, then down to Khana- i-Zanian river, which it more or less follows for 2 farsakhs, the water here is plentiful, and the climate bracing, though in the middle of the day in the summer months the sun is very hot, and all travel ling should be done either early in the morning or late in the even ing. Three farsakhs after leaving the river good tvater is again pro curable, and from this to Shiraz every few miles you find a plentiful supply. This district has a very small population. I know of no diseases special to the district. Intermittent fever, dyspepsia, and ophthalmia are the most prevalent; small-pox is probably never absent. “ Shiraz (4,750 feet above the sea) is situated on the right bank of a river, in a fertile and well watered valley, about 7 miles wide. The river, which has often a large volume of water from December to April, is dry for the rest of the year, the water being used for irri gation. It empties itself into the salt lake, the upper margin of which is perhaps 12 miles from Shiraz in a south-easterly direction. Five miles south of Shiraz, the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. Shiraz has probably a population of 35 000; it is irregularly circular in shape and is about 5 miles in cir cumference. The streets are for the most part narrow and winding, and until recently were ill-paved, but the present Governor has in this respect made a decided improvement; all the principal streets have by his orders been repaired. The refuse from the houses is carried away by donkeys, but much remains to be done; dead cats, dogs, and other putrid matter often remain in the streets for weeks to gether. In each house is a privy, connected with a hole, 8 or 10 feet deep, which is usually in the street; this is covered up, and into it the excrement finds its way; a good deal of the liquid soaks into the surrounding ground; this hole, when full, is emptied, and the contents carried away. Nearly the whole soil on which Shiraz is built is thus impregnated. The water-supply is brought to the town by means of kandts, and is carried to the different quarters by water-courses, about 2 feet deep; these are in some places open, but are generally covered with stone; but even then the crevices are not carefully filled in so that refuse often finds its way into them, and in wet weather they are the only means for carrying off the surplus water. This forms the drinking supply for the greater portion of the inhabitants, though many have their drinking water carried from the toot ot the mountains, where it is excellent. , , . , “ The climate of Shiraz is, on the whole, dry, though heavy dew falls in the spring, and during the cold weather there is a moderate rainfall. The winter, lasting from the beginning of December to the middle of February, is usually mild. There is often frost at night, and snow sometimes falls, but on the plain seldom remains for more540 SHI—SHI • than a few hours, though the surrounding mountains are snow* capped for some months, the weather in spring is very genial and pleasant, but the sun begins to be hot in the middle of the day in April. July and August are the hot months, but fortunately the nights are comparatively cool, especially in the open. All travelling from May to September is usually done in the early morning or evening, and this holds good throughout the interior of Persia. The direct rays of the sun are felt through the day, rarifying the atmosphere out of all proportion to the general temperature. Cereals, vines, melons, cucumbers, cabbages, beetroot, opium, cotton, and tobacco are exten sively cultivated. Fir, cypress, and orange trees also grow, the last- named are not found further north. “ The diseases prevalent in Shiraz and surrounding districts are intermittent fever, enlarged spleen, hepatitis, dyspepsia, costiveness, haemorrhoids, dropsy, infantile diarrhoea, intestinal worms, asthma, bronchitis, ophthalmia, opacities of cornea, hepatitis, iritis, cataract, syphilis in the various stages, gonorrhoea, stricture, retention of urine, urinary calculi, eczema, measles, pertussis, small-pox, typhoid fever, puerperal fever, chronic rheumatism, paralysis, and epilepsy, and in children meningitis. Amongst the diseases which are in England very common, but here are seldom met with, may be mentioned, phthisis, pneumonia, acute rheumatism and diseases of the heart and kidneys as primary affections. Cases of fracture of the bones of the upper and lower limbs and severe mutilation as the result of accident are rare. Fracture of the skull, injuries and wounds caused by bidlets and sword or knife are not unfrequently seen. Attempts at suicide occasionally occur, usually by means of arsenic or opium. Intermittent fever is probably the most prevalent disease in Persia; in Shiraz cases occur all the year round, but in the autumn it is most common, and is then more severe and persistent. After an unusually heavy rainy season, intermittent fever is much more rife. Natives explain it by excessive indulgence in fruit, but Mr. Odling attributes it to the greater amount of water lying about, which breeds the malarial poison or miasma, and makes it more active. This is hardly borne out by the case of Dih-i-Bld, which is 7,500 feet high, and very dry and bracing, the very last place it would have been thought that fever would occur, yet the inhabitants suffer there too. An attack is generally preceded by premonitory symptons—frontal head ache, pain in eyes; at this time Dr. Odling found 6 or 8 grains will prevent an attack; in ordinary cases he gives 4 grains cinchona alka loid in the form of pills three times a day, and also 8 to 10 grains 4 hours before the next attack is expected, and if the time passes without the attack, he continues 4 grains twice daily for a few days longer; at the same time he prescribes an aperient if necessary, and also the following mixture : Aromatic spirits of ammonia 3 'drams, and bi.-carb. of soda 2 drams in 12 ozs. of water, one dose to be taken 3 times daily. If vomiting takes place dilute hydrocyanic acid and bismuth. Usually he finds that going to bed, using an extra blanket or two and drinking hot tea freely quickly produces perspir ation. Occasionally also -jL- grain tartar emetic, and 1 to 2 drops541 SHI—SHI of tincture of aconite are necessary. If cinchona fails, he uses quinine with perhaps 5 minims of liquor arsenicalis, gradually increasing the minims. Dyspepsia, too, is very common in Persia, traceable to the way in which young children are fed. Diseases of the eye do not call for special mention. Fifteen cases of stone are on an average treated annually, one-third from Shiraz and the remainder brought in from Kazrun and Mashhad-i-Murghab, or Fasa and Firuzabad. Shiraz is probably never free from measles, pertussis, typhoid fever, and small-pox. A severe epidemic of diphtheria raged in the spring of 1876, causing in two months 200 deaths; but up to 1884 no more cases occurred until January and February 1885. Gangrene occurs not unfrequently. Mr. Odling, who has lived nine years in Shiraz, has never seen a case of typhus fever, scarlet fever, or hydrophobia. With the exception of the prevalence of intermittent fever, he con sider this district fairly healthy ; epidemics are not frequent, and the temperature is not excessive. Longevity is rare; at the age of 65 a person is considered old, and extremely few, if any, reach the age of 80 years. Meteorological Observations from January to March 1885. At 9 A.M. Dry Wet Bulb.

SHUSTAR—Lat. 32° 3'. Long. 48° 53'. Elev. 400. A town, the capital of Khuzistan, situated on the left bank of the Karun river, 170 miles south-west of Isfahan. Shustar is situated at the foot of a low range of sand hills called Kuh-i-Fadalak (?), running parallel with the great Bakhtiari chain, and about 18 miles distant from it. The river Karun immediately above the town is divided into two branches; that to the north is the original channel of the river, that to the south the _celebrated Nahr-i-Mas- rukan, or the artificial canal, now called the Ab-i-Gargar. The river is crossed by an ancient bridge at the south-west extremity of the town, about 300 yards. The town is surrounded by the Ab-i-Gargar, the river Karun, and a small canal connecting the two; these form its natural defences; the old walls are in ruins. It is thus picturesquely situated in the upper point of an island formed by the two branches of the Karun. On a bluff hill of sandstone rock rising boldly from the river to a considerable elevation, 150 yards north-east of the bridge, stands the castle; on one side alone it is defended by the river.* The high ground rapidly falls to the level of the city, and the castle itself is commanded by higher positions ; it is consequently a place of no strength, and would be incapable of defence even against a Persian army, supposing the town to have fallen into the enemy's hands. The town is surrounded on its whole circuit by a wall of sun-burnt bricks, flanked by semi-circular towers. These, says Layard, are in a dilapidated state and unprovided with any defence. Colonel Holland, however, is of opinion that the town might be rendered sufficiently strong to resist any but a well-appointed European army. In the centre of the castle there is a large and substantially built house, which serves as the residence of the governor or any other great personage visiting the town. The rock on which the castle stands has been per forated, and a subterranean canal is carried through it; several shafts having been dug down to this canal, it, together with the river, sup plies the interior of the building with water. The town itself, though reputed in Persia a place of great strength, is, under existing cir cumstances, far from being even tolerably fortified, but might undoubtedly be rendered a very strong and important position. The houses of Shustar are all built of stone, some of them being five storeys high. To defend themselves from the heat of the summer, the inhabitants have “sardabs,' some of which are 60 feet underground. Shustar is divided into twelve mahallahs or quarters; some of them, however, are almost in ruins. Its population is reported to have amounted formerly, and even during the government of Muhammad 'AliMirza, to 45,000 souls. This, however, is probably muchexagger- * Here about 300 yards wide. {Probyn.)605 ated. Layard thought it certainly did not contain more than 10,000 inhabitants when he visited it in 1845, and it is now reduced to about 8,000. The Shustaris are net wealthy, but at the same time there is less actual poverty and destitution in this town than in most others in Persia. u They are,” says Layard, “bigots in religion, and attend strictly to its outward rites and ceremonies. Saiads and Mullas have a great influence over them. The population is, on the whole, moral, and crimes, except on occasions of popular ferment, appear to be of rare occurrence/^ Selby, however, says that the Shustaris are the least bigoted of any Muhammadans he ever met, and that he received the greatest liberality and hospitality from them. The Arabic language is generally understood, although the Persian prevails, and the Arabic drSs is at the same time affected in preference to that of Persia. The inhabitants of Shustar are usually divided into as many parties as there are chiefs. The consequence of these divisions is manifest,— frequent disturbances take place, which generally terminate in blood shed The jealousies existing between the chiefs are fomented by the Government, to which they thus easily fall a prey. Besides these po litical chiefs, there are many Saiads in Shustar, of high reputation and great influence, backed by a reputation of sanctity. Although they take no open part in political dissensions, they are frequently, in fact, the chief promoters of them. He who can ensure the support of these holy men, with the addition of the Mujtahids and Mullas, is the most certain of success in the province of Khuzistan. Prom Shustar families have been daily emigrating to the country of the Bam Lam Arabs of the K'ab, and to Basra. The inhabitants are greatly oppressed by their chiefs and by the Government The Government accounts of Shustar and Dizful are kept by a Mus- taufi; they are, however, greatly neglected, and are general y m arrears. The chief of each quarter collects the appointed sum frona its inhabitants, but very seldom pays to the Government that which he has received : but, appropriating it to his own use, is compelled, when called upon for payment, to oppress all within his power m order to raise the amount a second time. He will even, very seldom, give a receipt for money received from a raiyat. . co . There are several Arab tribes considered as dependencies of Shustar and Dizful They occupy the plains to the west of those towns, fre- ana Y lzl -’n iiil aee s, cultivate corn, barley, and nee, and tend large flocks of sheep. They have their own petty Shaikhs, who “TLZ-geTatr^ «.... aJu/miles from Shuster, but are sometimes taken through the canal than is now' carried on, but were checked by the chilling influence of Per-606 SHU—SHU sian rule; their efforts have been abortive, and their desire to better them selves, their countrymen, and posterity has been met with the habitual discountenance of their rulers, whose aim has ever been to prevent Shustar from rising to that importance which its situation and natural advantages justly entitle it to hold. Close to the hills, watered on all sides by the river and canals, numerous gardens close around; Shustar presents a most pleasing ap pearance, and would in a short time, with proper encouragement, again be held in that estimation it was formerly, and become one of the first commercial towns in Persia. Between the first range of hills under which the town is built, and the second from whence the river first emerges, is the plain of A kill, watered by the river and numerous canals, and presenting, as far as the eye can reach, one vast corn-field, studded with numerous villages and date and orange gardens. In it are also the remains of a very large canal cut from the river near the second range of hills, and which even now is upwards of 80 yards broad. This was carried through the plain to the eastward of the river, irrigating the whole country. Modern canals of great extent and in good repair with which the whole plain is intersected serve at present to irrigate the country, to assist nature in rendering this one of the most fertile spots in the whole province. Selby has the following remarks on the position of Shustar : “ From the Shustaris' leaning to the English, their hatred of the Persians, who have by their tyranny, oppression, and exactions, well earned it, the proximity of Shustar to India, which, thanks to steam, can now be made, at any season a passage of, at most, 18 days, the greatest facility for steam navigation offered by vast quantities of wood all along the banks, all combine to point out Shustar as the spot from which we might pour an unlimited force into the heart of the country. In aturally strong, being completely insulated, capable of being rendered almost impregnable, Shustar might, in our hands, become a thorn in Persia s side, which she could never eradicate. From Shustar to the interior of Persia there are five roads practicable for heavily laden animals and even for guns— 1 . By Dizful to Khuratnabad to Karmanshah and Hamadan. 2. Direct to Isfahan through the Bakhtiari country by Gotwand and Bazuft. 3. By Kala-i-Tul, and Fallal, to Kumishah. 4. By Bihbahan, Dih Dasht to Falat and Kumishah. 5. By Bihbahan to Shiraz through the Mamaseni country. Rivadaneyra’s Notes, 1875. Shustai has 7,000 inhabitants,—Jths of town in ruins. When there is much water, small steamers pass up the river as far as Shustar ; small steamers can pass to Ahwaz. Caiavans go to Bihbahan in eight days, but the route is rather difficult. 1 le contribution of Shustar to the revenues is 21,000 tumans. Honey abounds in the hills to the eastward. Naphtha is found, and the peison who has the monopoly of this pays 400 tumans yearly to the overnment. Opium is largely grown, and its cultivation is yearly incieasing, superseding cereals. The price is 12 tumans per man ofSliustar = mans o£ Tabriz. Last year the crops partially failed, 4,000 Shustari mans were exported. Lucas gives it as 1,500 shahmans*. Usually the export is larger. Naphtha, both liquid and solid, is exported. Its price is 2 to 3| kirans per one Shustari man. Export calculated at 5,000 mans. Communication with Muhammarah by river up stream about ten days, and down six or seven days. Cost of transit 1| kiran per Shustar man. To Isfahan the caravans take twelve stages, and cost of carriage ranges from 1| to 3 kirans per man— From Bhustar to Bihbahan caravans take five to eight days according to weather. Cost of carriage 1 kiran per man. About Shustar rice is grown. Raw sugar is imported and prepared for sale. It sells at 8 kirans per man. The greater part of European goods are English, from India, but some goods also come from Tabriz. Iron is sold at 1 tuman per bar of 6 mans. From Khuramabad to Dizful 255 kilometres, or 158 miles. Dizfid to Shustar direct 66 kilometres, or 41 miles. Dizful to Fellabiah, near Mubammarah, 319 kilometres, or 198 miles. Khuramabad to the Shatt-ul-Arab, say 3,356 miles. (Map was attached, but not apparently trustworthy.) The Shustar district is estimated at 22,000 souls, paying a revenue of 22,000 tumans. Dizful is a more important place now than Shustar. After the de struction of Ahwazby Tlmurlang, towards the end of the 14th century, Shustar, already an ancient city, became the centre of commerce in Khuzistan, and continued to be so until the great plague ot 1331-32. The plague, which dealt lightly with Dizful, left few people living in Shustar. The Lurs and Persians, whom its magnificent and warlike Khans had hitherto kept at a respectful distance, fastened on the weakened but still wealthy city, and plundered it unmercifully. Die surrounding country became infested by Lur and Arab robbers, an the Persian trade, which had been prosecuted by the Karan, Shustar, and Isfahan, took other and safer routes. One of these was that by Amarah on the Tigris, Dizful, and Khuramabad, and Dizful thus benefited by the ruin of Shustar. Into the almost perpendicular sides of the sandstone hills north-east of Shustar, and on the left side of the river, are cut many chambers and niches, Gabar dakhmahs, and on the flat hill tops we see ^re and there platforms, 6 feet by 4, which were used as places ^r washm the dead. Here and there amongst the hills are rums of P 1 ^ 01 ms built of stone, and remains of steps leading up to them. ie ^ i Shustar was built, according to one authority, by a slav ® ^ itiP- to another bv Nur Ullah Ibn Sharif. Schindler gives a detailed description of the water system of Shustar. It is considered Pj ™st that a canal might be made carrying the river transport as fai as bhus tar. * The Shustar opium is sent through Muhammarah direct, and Bftshahr to Maskat for transmission to Zanzibar; 607 sometimes viaSHU-SHU There is a telegraph line from Hamadan to Burujird and Shustar. The Governor of Shustar, in 1882, was Abdul Wahab Khan, a native of the town. The present condition of the place is filthy and ruinous in the extreme. It has but little trade, and no industries, with the ex ception of carpet and felt manufacture, in which only some 200 people are engaged. (Kinneir — Chesney — Layard—liawlinson — Loftus — Holland — Lovaz — Uoss—Lucas — Robertson — Baring?) Lieutenant-Colonel Bell (March 1884) writes about Shustar and its vicinity :— “ From Band-i-Kir to Daulatabad the road is good, and can be readily widened and improved. “ Between Daulatabad an_d Shustar it is narrow and bad. Following generally the line of the Ab-i-Gargar, it is cut up by canals and ravines; the former are crossed by rough log or fascine bridges, 2 to 8 feet wide. No bridging material, beyond the rafters of the nearest huts, is available on the spot. “ Had the swamp not intervened, the better road would lie in the direct line between Band-i-Kir and Shustar. This road would be im passable after rain. “ The above road is known as the Ban! Kaid Hasan Khan. t( An alternative, but longer, road keeps to the left bank of the river, crossing the Gargar by tbe Pul-i-BoleitI, and is called the ( Baui Daudi 1 road. “ To the south of Shustar the population is Arab. The Arab dress, the ‘ aVa * and ‘ ka'ba/ are chiefly worn by the chiefs of the town, the lower orders wear blue cotton trousers and tunics girded round the waist. They do not wear the kefiyeh, or camels' hair turban, that being worn by true Arabs only ; the Persian felt hat is worn, or else an ample pagri. The prevailing colour of the dress of the lower orders is blue. “ From Shustar roads lead to Isfahan, 12 or 15 stages of 275 miles. Communications. To Bihbahan, 6 stages of 130 miles, and thence to Shiraz, 9 stages of 170 miles, and to Karman- shah, 10 stages of 245 miles, insecure on account of its proximity to the Turkish frontier; to Gulpaigan, and to Hamadan, see pages 207, 209, 220, 225 of Gazetteer of S. W. Persia. “ As regards the vicinity of Shustar about the Pul-i-Lashkar, the banks of the Ab-i-Khurd, below the bridge, are well wooded, 12 feet high, and slope upwards towards the city. The ground south of the town is uneven ; the poppy is extensiyely cultivated on either bank. Above the bridge the banks of the Ab-i-Khurd are also well wooded, and the ground along its left bank well cultivated, and slopes upwards ^ ^ nor ^ 1 ) var&lt; ^ fh® ground slopes downward towards the Ab-i-Shateit. The timber is suited for bridging purposes (crib “Three gates give access to the city on either side. The town walls are in ruins, and its outskirts are in ruins; an enclosed enceinte could readily be formed out of its debris, stone jemg plentiful everywhere. The town occupies a space not exceeding 608SHU—SHU one mile square, and, as above described, is situated on a slightly elevated site. The Ab-i-Gargar, a canal whose water is drawn from the Karun, and across the mouth of which runs the Band-i-Kaisar, washes it on the east, flowing in a bed 120 to 200 feet wide, between perpendicular cliffs 50 to 100 feet high, consisting of clay with im bedded masses of soft limestone. “To the north the hills, 2| miles distant, and the rising ground beyond the river command the town; to the east of the Gargar rising ground also commands it; yet the ruined outskirts are so deep and the streets so narrow that bombardment by light artillery would cause little damage. To the west, round by south, the Ab-i-Khurd, a they are most difficult to traverse, and are quite impassable to wheels; they are the city drains (see Dizful). “ The walls of the houses are high for those of the east, 15 to 25 feet and 30 feet, and are solidly constructed of stone and lime or mud. The roofs are mostly flat, of mud over wooden rafters; some are arched ; the bricks in use are about H feet thick. Numerous arcades exist in the town, many of which are in ruins. « The fort, 350 to 400 yards long by 150 yards wide, stands on high ground, 200 yards above Valerian's bridge; the citadel occupies its north-east angle, and dominates its interior. Its outer walls, 15 to 20 feet high, are of mud, 6 feet thick, and backed by casemates with pointed arched doorways, opening into the interior, now a poppy garden. Tlie roofs of the casemates are flat. “ A canal from the Ab-i-Shateit flows into a tunnel under the tort, from which water is drawn by wells. Branches from this tunne supnlv the city with water. Arms and ammunition were said to be ~ J i J *11 nnu ~ AU ^ riourrov waahps canal taken out of the Ab-i-Shateit at Valerian's bridge, and falling into the Gargar below the Pul-i-Lashkar,_completes the water defence on that side. Again to its west lies the Ab-i-Shateit itself. « The streets of the town are 8 to 10 feet wide; worn into deep ruts, s of 270 A es,andtl»s d to Kara® its proM an, see stored in the fort. It mounts no ifd nr&gt;vfT&gt;ovn fsipp • Vimisps erowd uoon its other faces. 609SHU—SHU Water was flowing over the Band-i-Kaisar (concave up stream) when visited. At times the band is dry, and may be traversed on foot, six narrow openings being left for the passage of the water. “ The Pul, or Band-i-Gargar, is an embankment thrown across the Ab-i-Gargar, about 800 yards below the Band-i-Kaisar, connecting the town with its suburb, the village of Boleiti. The water of the canal is carried round the band through four tunnels, two under either bank, excavated in the sandstone rock, and turns numerous small mills, the mechanical construction of which are most defective. Below the band the canal is 120 feet wide, and its bed 50 feet deep. “ A few hundred yards below the Pul-i-Gargar is a second band, over which water was flowing when visited. “ The final band across the canal, and over which water was also flowing, is situated about 4 miles down-stream, below the Pul-i-Shah 'All. “ Shustar, once the capital town of Khuzistan, is now second in im portance to Dizful. The number of its inhabitants, from 45,000, has dwindled within the last century to 6,OCO; its trade is now insigni ficant and its bazar untenanted—a decadence attributed by the in habitants themselves to official exactions and a total want of all government. “ Selby considers the character of the Shustaris to be far superior to that of the Persians generally, and remarked that, “although op pressed, yet they themselves did not oppress, nor did they fawn when in your power; they hate the Persians.' Other travellers have painted them in less favourable colours. So far as could be judged, the bigotry assigned to them formerly does not now exist. The race is the result of the intercourse between Arabians and Persians. Shustar is so isolated from Persia Proper by the Zagros range, that, did the oppor tunity offer, they would doubtless join the Lur and Arab tribes, living within and to the south of those mountains, in revolt against their Persian masters. “The plague and cholera morbus in 1831-32 depopulated Shustar; the general salubrity of the district is good (see under Dizful). “ From the foregoing description it will be seen that Shustar occupies a site important both politically and commercially &lt;e Politically, on account of its natural military strength; its geographical position with reference to the tribes of Arabs occupying the coast plains to the foot of the hills, and the Iliyat tribes of Lurs, Bakhtiaris, Kashkai, Kuhgehlu, &amp;c., occupying the mountainous country extending to the line Burujird-Isfahan, all more or less dis affected towards their extortionate Persian masters ; the pressure which the possibility of its occupation by troops could not fail to bring on the 1 ihran Court; and the paramount influence over South-West Persia, which would follow from the establishment of firm relations there. Commercially, because its position on the Kanin river with water communication with India lessens the land route to Tihran by 137 miles, and brings it within 485 miles, and Isfahan within 275 miles of a port, and must lead to the attraction of much trade from the fertile districts of Hamadan and Karmanshah, and to a successful 610competition with Russian trade from the north. In the hands of a mercantile nation, Shustar could not fail to become the first commer cial town in Persia. “The present Governor is Mirza Asadulla Khan. By raft the down journey to Band-i-Kir is 20 hours, via the Ab-i-Shateit. The risks of being plundered when journeying on this arm of the river, or on the Dizful river are great. The plains about Shustar become covered with grass on the cessation of the rains (end of February); the grass increases until May, after which it disappears as quickly as it comes and the whole country becomes a parched and barren desert. The plains below Shustar are capable of producing almost everything. The country enclosed by the two arms of the Karun to its south glows sugarcane, opium, indigo, cereals, and cotton. Strabo lecords that the Shustar dependencies yielded to the husbandman 100 to 200-fold. “ The autumn sowings of wheat and barley, the “ Shatwi,” takes place in the end of November. The “ Saifi,” or spring sowings, con- sist of cotton, rice, maize, sesame, tobacco, vegetables, &amp;c. “Shustar is considered by Sir H. Rawlinson to be one of the best supplied districts in Asia. Barley sells in the spring at 451bs. the kiran (8^.), and wheat at 261bs. A sheep weighing 301bs. will cost 4 kirans. The cultivation of grains requires to be encouraged to en sure a large export trade in it resulting. “ Heavy contributions levied upon the peasants have driven them from this fertile district. In the town some 200 people are engaged in the manufacture of carpets and felt. The former are of cotton and of no beauty. In 1876 an epidemic similar to that which visited Baghdad/devastated the towns of Shustar, Dizful, and the surround- ing country. ' For climate see under Dizful. SHUTAR KHAB— Lat. Lo . 11 ^* , .

A town, capital of Ardalan, situated 300 miles south-south-east of labriz, south of Zangan, south-west of Kazvin, 60 miles north-west of Hamadan, /? miles north of Karmanshah, north-east of Baghdad, and east south-east of Sulimania. it is secluded in the bosom of a deep valley, well cultivated and interspersed with orchards of peach, apricot, pear, apple, and cherry trees, and is at once a most romantic and flourishing little town. It is surrounded by a mud wall; its population amounts to about 4,000 612613 souls,* of which number 200 are Jews and Armenians, and 50 are Nestorians, who trade to Mosul, Baghdad, and Isfahan. The Wall, who seldom quits this place, resides in a sumptuous palace, built on the top of a small hill in the centre of the town, where he maintains a degree of state and splendour superior to anything Kinneir had seen in Persia except at Court. The Kurds of Sihna are Sunis, but the Wall and his family affect to be Shiahs to please the Shah of Persia. It is so surrounded by hills that the town is not seen till you are close to the suburbs. Its appearance is pleasing ; the houses are well built, and the gardens and cultivation in its vicinity are pretty. It enjoys a fine climate, the small valley in which it is situated being protected from the severity of the winters in this elevated country by the hill around it. It has a castellated palace, situated on a height above it. At a quarter of a mile to the south-west of the town is a magnificent garden called Khasrabad. The district of Sihna is divided into seven “ t'alluks/' namely, Juanru on the south-west, Avroman, Marivan, Banah, Sakiz (on the Tabriz road), Hasanabad and Isfandabad. Each of these is divided into four or five smaller divisions. The tradespeople of Sihna pay a sort of license tax, which varies from one tuman to ten tumans per annum, according to their respective means. The ordinary trades are all represented, but the chief industry is carpet-making, and, as the wool of Kurdistan is of superior quality, the carpets made at Sihna are considered among the best of their kind. There were plenty of horses for sale, useful animals of no parti cular breed, but standing 14 hands and 2 inches and over, and able to do a good day's work. I bought a couple for my escort; neither of them is much to look at, but one has turned out a good useful hoise. Piece-goods are the principal article of import into Sihna; they come from England via Baghdad and Karmanshah, and also from Russia through Northern Persia. The yearly value amounts to about 150,000 tumans. The exports comprise— Ghi Gum . . . • Carpets .... Wool .... Gall-nuts to Hamadan „ Baghdad . „ Russia The gall-nuts are all gathered in the Mariwan, Juan, Sakiz, and Avroman; trade in grain with Sulimania. * Thomson, 1868, has 20,000. Mr. T. C. Plowden, 1881, says—“ The population of the town of Sihna, as estimated by a Christian merchant, comprises ^ Muhammadans (mostly Sum) Jews ....

During the recent scarcity, wheat rose to 150 kirans, barley to 120 kirans, and ghi to 170 kirans. At the time of my visit, wheat stood at 20 kirans, barley at 15 khans, and ghi at 140 kirans. Gerard gives the number of houses at 4,000 (also called 7,000). The district is under the Zh-us-Sultan at Isfahan. The carpets above alluded to are usually the size of hearth rugs, 9 by 4| feet, but sometimes in long rolls, 18 by 4 feet. Their prices Vary from Its. 6 to Us. 60. The Iliyats make them, and mineral dyes ate used, which make the colours very fast. Sihna is the centre of several routes, viz.) to Ramadan 24 hours, in five stages; to Karmanshah 16 hours, in four stages; Zuhab 33 hours in eight stages. There are two blue inlaid minars worthy of attention in the town. Uwa Anga to the west, the spurs from which fall to the town. To the south is the high range of Dushand, 10,000 feet. Sihna has about 4,000 houses (also called 7,000). A very handsome building, on small rising ground, in the middle of the town, is half barrack half palace. There are about 40 Christian families and a Khalifa or Bishop, but he lives in rather native style. There is a garrison of two regi ments and some guns. The rough, and, in some respects, nicest-looking carpets are cheapest, Rs. 6 to 8, whilst a thick and heavy, but rather smooth kind, are about 100 to 150 kirans (40 to 60 rupees each). The following routes lead from Sihna - . Sihna to Kirgowa 3 hours. A suborner route to Zuhab exists, but was declared difficult from snow until 1st May— {Malcolm — Kinneir — Rich — Plowden — Gerard.)

Regarding this tribe, Mr. T. C. Plowden says (1881) as follows:— “ The country of the Sinjabis extends from the Khan of Mahidasht to Shila Zuliat (?), which lies 8 farsakhs to the west of the town of Karmanshah. This tribe has two principal divisions ; (1) Chalawi (?), of which Faraj-ullah Khan is chief; (2) Dilyari, under Ilahi Khan! The whole tribe numbers about 1,000 families, and furnishes a con tingent of 150 horsemen on the usual terms. The Sinjabis, like the Kalhur, are famous breeders of mules,* but the three years’ famine has told heavily on their resources, and they are not in a prosperous con dition.' {Ferrier — Plowden.)

A wretched-looking village in Ears, 17 miles north of Persepolis. It contains 250 houses, is on the road to Yazd, and is built chiefly on the sloping side of a mountain. In the excessive heats of summer, when water becomes scarce, the inhabitants remove into the valley below where there is a stream called the Rud-Khanah-i-Sivand. Some pro visions are procurable here. The valley is covered with the liquorice plant and camel thorns, and contains some good trees, among which is a very large and beautiful plane tree. Lurs chiefly inhabit it. A road goes hence over the Kuh-i-Gurba to Mayin. The houses are very mean in size, built of mud, with flat roofs made of reeds. It is commanded at short range on the north, south, and east. The only water-supply is from the river. There is a small tract of level ground below the village, which reaches down as far as the river, and is covered with wheat cultivation. A good many mules are obtainable in this village (according to Ross, 400). It forms, with other villages, the petty subdivision of Hafrak Bala. Its climate is good.

The chief city of Northern Kurdistan has 1,200 houses, one-third of which became uninhabited by reason of the disturbances of 1881. There is a telegraph station, the terminus of a branch from Tabriz. There is a garrison of 1,000 men here, armed with muzzle-loading rifles. A considerable trade is carried on from here with Russia. Some of the fish caught here are good, and the house-made wires pronounced excellent. The place gives its name to the district around, of which Miandab is a large village. In the eastern frontier of the district are a considerable number of nomad camps, from which camels might be procured. In summer these camps are found in the mountains further east. In the town of Suj Bulak alone in all Persia are two-wheeled carts to be obtained. They are however rough and only adapted for use in the plain. Forage, equally with grain, would be procurable in large quantities in the western portion of the district. Water is scarce Only in the barren tracts to the east. The only natural fuel obtainable in the route after leaving Malik Kandi is a small thorny shrub found in the plain, which serves well for the purpose, but is difficult to collect. In the winter camps of the nomads large quantities of this fuel, as also of tapala, or cakes of camels’ dung, may be found collected 618during autumn or early winter. The great caravan route between Tabriz and Sul!m§,ma leads through Suj Bulak. During winter and spring Sftj Bulak can only be reached from Binab by very round-about ways. The tracts of land lying low become then quite impassable, and the caravans have to follow the border of the mountain as far as the town of Miandab, whence they are able to cross the valley of the Jagatu. The hereditary chief of the Mikri Kurd tribe pays a tribute of 12,000 tumans to secure his title to the governorship of the district.

Of all the places 619■ Mi SUL—SUN this stands prominent for the utter state of anarchy which exists and for the fanaticism of the population and dominant position of the Shaikhs (religious). Two battalions are quartered here and one at Kara- dagh. In 1881 the town was besieged for four days by Hamawands, and would have fallen but for the arrival of another battalion. The inhabitants had in the first instance invited them, but subsequently feared admitting them. No walls exist to the town, but the narrow lanes are easily defended. Small caravans are plundered close to the town with impunity, and sometimes altogether looted to stripping a man’s clothes. A great many fox-skins are exported hence to Russia. Fifty years ago Travers wrote of Sullmama that it was a miserable collection of hovels and ruins. It is situated in a hollow, about 2 miles from the foot of the east range of hills. The neighbouring hills are steep and bare, about 900 feet high. It contained then about 2,000 houses of Muhammadans, 130 of Jews. The climate is intensely cold in winter, but pleasant in summer. It is a tributary province of the Baghdad Pashalik. {Travers — Gerard.) SULIMANlAH—Lat. Long. Elev.

J . r l^ e flourishing agricultural town of Sungar extends its gardens and vineyards across to the skirt of the Dalakhana mountain. There are forty shops in the town. Unlike most other towns in Persia it has no ruined quarter, the famine, though felt, having left no permanent traces. 620SUN—SUR The inhabitants, almost entirely engaged in agriculture, export their corn, fruit, and a few carpets made by their women. The Kurdish nomads of the district, having the command of extensive pastures, rear large numbers of small, hardy horses and mules. Forage and fuel are plentiful. The district conservancy at Girdakanu consists of two valleys, that of the Gawa Rud, undulating and bare, showing a few villages and large stretches of excellent corn-land; and that of the Shaju Rud, in which lies the town, level, well-watered, and covered with villages, gardens, and plantations. There are said to be, in all, including ham lets in the mountains, 153 villages, of which twenty have a hundred houses and upwards. The average of the whole is about thirty houses.

A river of Khuzistan, which has its source from two branches, the eastern and larger of which comes from Ears, and is formed by the junction of the Harhahars (?) with the Rudkhana-i-Shlr and other affluents, at a spot about 20 miles west north-west of Shiraz * Its course is north-west as far as the considerable village of Eahliun, from whence, much diminished by irrigation, it runs nearly west to Zaitun, and there it receives the Khairabad river, or Tab branch, which comes thither along the borders of Ears by a west south-west course, passing 8 miles southward of Bihbahan. The river, now of considera ble size, preserves a south-western course as far as Hindian, a town of about 4,000 inhabitants, up to which, when ascended by Lieutenant Whitelocke, of the Indian Navy in 1836, it was found to be navigable for boats of twenty tons. Erom hence the river inclines more south ward, and has a tortuous course through an alluvial soil to the Persian Gulf, into which it falls in latitude 30° 4' 30*, longitude 49° 32' 12*. An extensive population have their dwellings on its banks. Lieutenant Whitelocke thus described the navigation of this river— “ The entrance to this river is in latitude 30° 4' 30* north. It is difficult to find, as there are no landmarks to guide you; you must be acquainted with the soundings to find the entrance. Erom Bushahr boats steer in a west north-west direction, carrying 5 or 6 fathoms from Ras Shut. Keeping in this depth of water, you will be about 5 or 6 miles from the coast. Off the Khor of Barekham, you will lessen your water to 2| and 2 fathoms; you steer then about south south-west and south, altering it as your depth of water will guide you. “In this Khor you have from 2 fathoms to 11, 1^, and 1 fathom high water. This Khor leads into the Khor of Hindian. The Khor of Hindian extends out about 1^ or 2 miles from the river; you will be steering, when you enter this Khor, east and east north-east, carry ing from 1 to lj fathoms. The hills called Kalat, the nearest range, bear about north-east by north. The distant hills behind Kalat, which are higher, and are called Zaitun, bear from north ^ east to east by north. “ The banks of the river at the entrance are covered with bulrushes for about 2 or 3 miles; no other vegetation. “At a place called Nakhl Bagosh, there are one or two date groves. Two miles from this is another date grove, but none aflerwaids until you reach Hindian town, nor any signs of vegetation with the excep tion of a few tamarisk trees. „ “ Erom the entrance you have 2| and 3 fathoms low water as tar as Ghaz (?) All in September. * According to St. John’s and Walker’s maps, the river referred ^nSanThe graph has no connection with that which flows into the Persian u nfiP-mnlia/au. two branches of which appear to rise in the mountains a little to t e noi i S624 TAB—TAB u The banks for some miles are low and covered with a layer of salt but gradually rise in height, from a village called Annonat to the town of Kut. At the village of Ghaz hAli they are about 8 feet, at Hindian town 14 feet, at the town of Dihmula 20 feet, and at Kut about -25 feet. There is no vegetation on them from Hindian town to Kut, except a few beds of water melons. “ The rise and fall, as far as Ghaz 'All, is 10 or 11 feet spring tides; water is sweet and very clear; the bottom hard mud. “ This river is about 200 feet wide at the entrance ; at Ghaz ’All not so wide, but at Hindian town only 180 feet, at Dihmula 150 feet, and at Kut not more than 100 feet. “In April, May, June, and July, when the water comes from the hills, it overflows the bank 15 feet high. “ There is plenty of fish in the river, one in particular, of about a foot in length, which sticks to the bottom of the boats, and causes them to leak. Unless you are very careful in examining them well often, it is probable that all your cargo and goods will be spoiled in one night. I had several things spoiled during a night, and found early in the morning the boat half full of water. “ The boats that come up this river are from 20 to 30 tons. But they cannot go further than Kut, as the water is low, and there are several banks reaching across the river.' {Kinneir — Whitelocke — Chesney — Impegny!) Lieutenant-Colonel Bell writes about this river “ The Zohreh, or river of Hindiyan, is]formed by the united waters of the Ab-i-Shur and Ab-i-Shmn (also called the Khairabad river and Shams-ul-Arab), which have their sources in the mountains of the Mamaseni. Their junction takes place in the vicinity of Chham; it contains a considerable body of water, and was with difficulty forded on the 14th June 1884.^ After traversing the outer low range of sandstone hills, it falls into the gulf a few miles from Hindian, to which village it is navigable for vessels of small burden (20 tons). Hindian is a town of 300 to 400 inhabitants. It can be forded 9 miles above the town. In passing through the ow hills south of Zaitun, its water becomes tainted and bitter, and is scaicely drinkable at Hindian. At the town its breadth is 80 yards in February, and unfordable.' He passed it on the road between Bihbahan and Bandar Dilam and says about it:— , h as a pleasing appearance, being dotted with villages, sunoun e by palm and hard wood trees. It is bordered to the south by a belt of low sandhills. “ To ford the river, which is at this season both deep and rapid, it is necessary to pass up stream about 3 miles and to ford it to the sou -wes o t re village ol Sardasht, where it flows in three channels; its right banks are low and pebbly; its bed is covered with boulders; its width is from 600 to 800 yards; the deepest channel is about 3' 6' deep; it must be forded with care; its right bank is fringed by a beltof low bushes; its left bank is elevated 20 to 30 feet over the stream. From the camp, above the ford on the left bank, Chham bore 31°; Sardasht, 40°. There are a few huts and a little cultivation close at hand on the left bank near the ford.” TABAR (?)— Lat. Long. Elev.

This is a great place for the manufacture of felt carpets, there being no less than thirty factories in it. There is a fortalice here, and the village is embosomed in gardens. Supplies are to be had in small quantities, and also water from springs. There is a celebrated fire-temple at Taft. An old dome rises above the trees; it is empty and the doors are gone, but the roof and walls still show beautiful work in blue and gold, with flowered tiles and fresco painting. Over the door, carved in wood, is the Arabic date, corresponding to the Christian year 1268. Hard-by stands the ruins of the shrine built by Shah Niamat Allah before he fixed his abode in Mahun. These buildings are of some extent, with the remains of handsome mural decorations. They are comparatively modern. Under the ancient dome are some beauti ful tombstones of Yazd marble, pale yellow and white, carved with the graceful Arabic letter. The handsomest is quite plain, but foi the Kalima, or creed of Islam, cut in the polished yellow stone. Iheie are lead mines in the neighbourhood. [Abbott — hnes — K/ianikoff—Stack.)

It is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the nearest range of hills, which are about 700 feet high, and come close down to the sea. Tahiri may be known by a square fort on the hill-side, about 100 feet above the sea, at the west end of the village ) there is a tower also, on the hills at the east end. It contains 200 to 300 men, all fishermen, and small supplies of cattle and vegetables can be obtained; water is plentiful and good. The bay is formed by a low point, projecting from the line of coast on either side of it, and is 2 miles across; there is an extensive date plantation and some cultivation on the east low point of the bay, and another grove a mile westward of the town, on the western point. Soundings in the bay are 8 fathoms at half a mile off, thence shoaling regularly. Holding-ground good, but perfect shelter from winds not obtainable. At this place are the most considerable of the ruins on the coasts of the Gulf as far as is known to Europeans. These are the ruins of an early Mussalman city of great importance, doubtless the once famous city Siraf, but on the hills behind this are remains of a different character and period, which unquestionably date from Gabr times. The whole hillside here has been denuded of its superstratum of sandstone, possibly for building purposes; little cells have been honeycombed in the rock. {Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot) TAHLIH—Lat.

A large span of ground is enclosed by high brick walls which surround the buildings and gardens. The entrance gate is covered with coloured tiles. Both palace and gardens are now somewhat dilapidated. At the foot of the hill is a large basin of water, 70 yards square, with a fountain in the centre. At each corner are small summer-houses, gaudily painted with bright flowing colours. From the edge of this basin rise six terraces, one above the other, on which stand rows of orange trees, the walls of each terrace being of coloured tiles. The ground is laid out in flower beds. On the highest terrace is the palace, small and mean-looking, its materials flimsy, and the decorations tawdry and glaring. The walls of some of the rooms, which are open to the front, are covered with representations in fresco of Persian beauties. On both sides and at the back of the buildings is a spacious garden, in which are rows of oranges, cypresses, and fruit-trees. This palace was built by Fatah 'All Shah when Governor of Shiraz, during the life of his uncle, and was long his residence. Many evidences of his taste and luxurious habits still remain. Now all is going rapidly to ruin and decay, and in a very short time the veiy materials will be removed to build with them another equally cost y and useless toy, which, in its turn, will be neglected and diverted.

In places the revetment is 6 feet wide, with an outer parapet 2 feet high; it is generally carried at a height of from 50 to 100 feet above the river. At its southern mouth is a dripping fountain, and an inscription relating the history of the construction of this most useful work.

Rocky and precipitous heights command the road throughout, rising abruptly on both sides and continuing so till the road debouches into the plain of Kumarij. There is another road over the mountains which is practicable for horses, though steep in some places. The mountains here are more accessible, and therefore offer less impediment to a force occupying the right and left of the pass, and the road down the ravine could easily be made practicable for artillery.

To the north-west of the town are very extensive ruins, said to have been a Portuguese town; if so, it must have been one of importance from the appearance of the ruins. In many parts the rock has been excavated for residences in the hot season, and the pass in the hills appears to have been fortified in a manner much beyond the abilities of the natives, at least of the present day. Wells have been also sunk to the depth of 40 or 50 fathoms through the rock. Very high up on the hills reservoirs in ruins are very numerous. On the whole, it has all the appearance of having been a large and flourishing town. Several trading boats of various sizes belong to Tauri. [Bruchs.) See Tahiri. TAWlLEH—Lat. Long. Elev.

A town in Persia, capital of the district of the same name 641 16 41612 YAZ—YAZ It is situated in the middle of a sandy plain, about 50 miles broad, bounded by high ranges of picturesque mountains. The town is surrounded by a wall, but a large proportion of the inhabitants live outside. The town itself is very uninteresting, and contains hardly any building worthy of note. The only remarkable one is the Jama Masjid, a very old building now ruined, the front of which, however, is still handsome. The bazars are narrow and irregular, but well stocked with goods and crowded with people. The Governor lives in a fortified enclosure outside the town. Christie states the population of Yazd to have lived in 1810 in 20,000 houses, besides 4,000 more for the Gabrs; but if this esti mate was correct, the numbers have since then very much decreased, as Smith, writing in 1868, says it only amounts to 30,000 souls, of whom 4,000 are Gabrs and 1,000 are Jews.* A large proportion of the inhabitants are engaged in the manufacture of silk, which is said to be superior to any other made in Persia. The raw material is obtained from the villages in the neighbourhood, and large quantities are also brought for manufacture from Gllan. Henna and rang for dyeing the hair, brought in a raw state from Minab and the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas, are ground and prepared for use and exported to all parts of Persia. Sugar is also refined and sent chiefly to Isfahan. Wool is also exported. The external trade appears to be very considerable, and the mer chants of Yazd are reputed to be among the most enterprising and respectable of their class in Persia. Some of their agents have lately gone, not only to Bombay, but to the Mauritius, Java, and China. The manufactures of Yazd consist of hash and aluhi (two sorts of silk cloth), and are superior to any of the kind in Persia; the Gabrs also make excellent candied sugar, and the namads, or felts, from Taft (a small village within 8 miles) are equal to the best made at Karman. Sheep are brought to this place from Shiraz, and grain from Isfahan. There are at least fifty thousand camels in the city; and a donkey will here sell as high as 15 tumans, or 15 pounds sterling, ihe city has a mean appearance, and has once had a wall, part of which still remains. Most of the trade comes from Bandar Abbas and goes to Tihran, some to Isfahan; some comes from Shiraz. ( Christie — Smith.) Commerce.

(#. Smith.) Yazd is the centre of the opium country. Opium taken thence to Bandar Abbas, the route thither opened in late years. (Stack.) Silk.—In time of a former governor (previous to 1870), there were 1,800 silk manufactories in Yazd, employing probably 9,000 hands. Since then only 300 (1870). The silk so extensively manufactured in these parts is considered by some persons to be the best in Persia. Revenue was stated to be 60,000 tumans paid to the Shah's treasury, and 40,000 retained to defray the cost of government. Exports .—Exports were sugar, opium, silk, rope, cotton, copper, and felt. Imports .—The imports were henna, wheat, and cotton goo^s. ' Yazd is celebrated for its sweetmeats. English articles imported There were in the city fifty mosques, sixty.five public baths, and eight public schools and colleges. Position .—Position of Yazd in middle of desolate country due to the existence,of the mountains of the Shirkuh 25 miles off, whence it is irrigated. A plan of Yazd is contained in Khanikofffs fC L'Asie Centrale.” There is no fire-temple at Yazd, according to Khauikoff. Prices Current.

A peculiar feature of Yazd is the number of large tanks far below the surface of the ground. They are neatly domed in and approached by long flights of steps. Many of the houses are similarly approached. ( Christie — Smith — Thomson — M. Smith—Mac Gregor — Floyer—Khan i Jcoff — Stack — Gasteiger.) YAZDABAD—Lat. Long. Elev.

Snow still lay on the hillsides bordering the basin. Wheat averaged 2 inches in height only, showing the severity of the winter. The road was said to be closed for general traffic for one month only during mid-winter and then for a few days only at a time. Mules and passengers could, it was said, pass even then along it.” . General Remarks. —The country between Khuramabad and Zaghe is treeless; it produces no firewood. Water, of excellent quality, is obtained from streams only, which are very numerous. There is little cultivation, but the grazing is generally excellent. ZAGHI or ZAGHAH—Lat. Long. Ele y- . A villao-e, 22£ miles from Khuramabad, on the road thence to Burujird.

A village in Khuzistan, 15 miles south of Bihbahan. It comprises about 2,000 inhabitants, and is situated in a pleasant valley, fertilised by both the branches of the river, called Zohreh and Hindlan, or Tab, which here form a junction. There is also a district of Bihbahan of this name, enclosed by a range of low hills, and admirably watered by the river Zohreh, from which numerous canals and watercourses are also derived. The land devoted to rice-grounds yields abundant crops of a superior quality. Cham is the principal village, and there are several others. Zaitun is bounded to the east by another range of sandstone hills, the west faces of which are exceedingly steep; to the east, however, they are very little above the level of the plain of Zaitun. Zaitun is bounded to the east by another range equally precipitous ; to the west however they unite almost insensibly with the plain of Bihbahan. These are the Zaitun hills. Their sides are furrowed by a thousand torrents, and the 1 ’oads across them are on the west side very difficult. Zaitun, formerly Zaidun, &lt;c meaning an olive tree” forms a central point whence trade from Hilam and Hindian {q.v.) converges. Goods go up by land, passing to Dih-Mula, then Arat, and then Zaitun. r lhe march of 20 miles to Bihbahan hence is stony and through the lower spurs of the mountain range.

Baron DeBode, however, says it is a Kurdish tribe, brought here from Karmanshah by Nadir Shah at the time when he transplanted the Bakhtiari to the Turkuman frontier. The colony of Zangenah, origin ally consisted of 2,000 families, which, from various causes, are now reduced to 400. {LciyciTd—DeBode?) r at j? Possibly there are two tribes of this name. Regarding the Zangenah of Karmanshah, Mr. T. C. Plowden says:—“About 300 families of this tribe occupy portions of the great Mahadasht plain, other families are settled at lilandasht and at Harasa, some 25 miles to the west of Karmanshah (town). Some -00 families are settled in the plains at the foot of the Parao hills to the north of Karmanshah, and another small detachment at Chahar (?) to the east of Karmanshah towards Haisin There are 2,000 families in all. The present (1881) head of eenah tribe is Muhammad Raza Khan Zahir-ul-mulk whose grandfather, uMstafa Kull Khan was once Governor of Karmanshah.

Most of the mule teers of Southern Persia come from this village. It is also called Zargan. It is quaintly situated at the foot of a great ridge of rock, 1,000 feet high, brown and bare. Though seemingly inaccessible, it can be ascended almost anywhere, and the view repays the labour of the climb. The plain below, occupied by the well-watered fields of Zar- gun and its villages, is good, cultivated country, and the lower hills are dotted with vineyards. {Felly — Morier—MacGregor—Slack.) 648ZAR—-ZER Mr. Odling, M.R.C.S., writes—* ff Zargun has in its immediate neighbourhood an extensive marsh, and in most seasons water is plentiful, and in-igation is so freely carried out that in the spring the plain seems to have a marshy character. Intermittent fever is very prevalent. In 1882 a severe epidemic occurred—whether cholera or fever not known—which carried off 700, principally childi-en. It extended to Si wand, Kawam- abad, Murgbab, which are all very liable to intermittent fever.

Elev. A town in the district of the same name, south-east of Sulimania, and west north-west of Karmanshah. It is described as a miserable place, having now barely thirty tenable huts, though formerly it contained a thousand houses. The climate of Zuhab is proverbially unwholesome, and the water, though clear and not unpleasant to the taste, contains some pernicious mineral component that, if indulged in for a short time only, seriously affects the travel ler. To the natives, however, it is not so baneful, but they are, never theless, aware of its bad qualities, for they recommend a raw onion to the stranger before a draught is indulged in. The water of the Shirwan, Halwan, and Zamkan is alike deleterious, both to men and cattle; so indeed are, with few exceptions, the whole of the springs which have their origin in this part of the Zagros range. Fevers are very prevalent, caused by the marshy nature of the district; and, excepting amongst the nomad tribes but few individuals wear an aspect of health. During the summer, the heat is excessively oppressive, and the myriads of annoying insects that infest the locality are represented as almost be yond endurance. A cooler atmosphere can, however, be reached in a few hours, and that luxury ice is attainable all the year round by sending to the mountains above. {Rawlinson—Jones.) ZUHAB—Lat. Long. Eley. _ _ A district of Persia lying on the frontier between Sulimania and Kar- It is'of considerable extent, lying at the foot of the ancient Zagros. “ It is bounded on the north-west by the course of the river Dial a, on the east by the mountains, and on the south by the stream of Halwan. It formed one of the ten pashaliks dependent upon Baghdad until about sixty years ago, when Muhammad Ah Mlrza, prince of Kar- 651ZUH—ZUH manshah, annexed it to the crown of Persia. At the treaty concluded between Persia and the Porte in 1823, it was stipulated that the dis tricts acquired by either party during the war should be respectively surrendered, and that the ancient frontier line should be restored, which had been established in the time of the Safavi monarchs. According to a subsequent treaty, Zuhab ought certainly to have been given up to the Turkish authorities, but Persia had neither the will to render this act of justice, nor had the Pasha of Baghdad the power to enforce it; and Zuhab, although still claimed by the Porte, has thus remained to the present day in possession of the government of Karmanshah. “Zuhab having been acquired in war is Khalisah,or crown land. It has been usually farmed by the government of Karmanshah, at an annual rent of 8,000 tumans (£4,000) to the chief of the Guran tribe, whose hardy Iliyats inhabit the adjoining mountains, and are thus at all times ready to repel an attack of the Osmanlis. The amount of its revenues must depend, in a great measure, upon the value of rice and corn, its staple articles of produce ; but in years of plenty, when the price of these commodities is at the lowest possible rate, a consi derable surplus will still remain in the hands of the lessee. The re venue system in this district is simple, and more favourable to the cul tivators than in most parts of Persia. It is thought derogatory to the chief to take any part of the cultivation into bis own immediate hands. He distributes grain to his dependants, and at the harvest receives as his share of the produce of rice two-thirds of corn in consequence of the water consumed in its irrigation, which is the property of the land lord or of government, and is rarely to be obtained without consider able expense and labour. “ The rice-grounds of Zuhab are chiefly irrigated by an artificial canal, brought from the Halwan river, a distance of about 10 miles. The canal is said to have been an ancient work, but was repaired and rendered available for its present purposes only about a hundred years ago by the same Pasha, who subsequently built the town of Zuhab. “ The revenues accruing to the chief averaged 10,000 tumans aunual- ly, of which the following is a rough statement:— From produce of rice, 2,000 kharwars, at 2 turaans per kharwar Ditto wheat and barley, 2,500 kharwars, at 1 tuman per kharwar ... Kent of the caravansarai of Sar-i-Pul, which includes the transit duty upon merchandise and the profits arising from a monopoly of the sale of grain to the Karbelai pilgrims ... Rent of the caravansarai of Kasr-i-Shirln ... Contract for the darughah-gari of Zuhab; the emoluments of this arising -rom the rent of shops in the Zuhab bazar, and several petty items of taxation ,,, • r j Fees exacted from the iliyat of Kurdistan for permission to pasture their flocks during the winter in the grazing-grounds of Zuhab ... browth ot cotton, rent of mills, orchards, and melon-grounds, value of pasturage, &amp;c., &amp;c. ... ttt ° Tumans. 4,000 2,500 1,000 200 800 1,000 500 Total ... 10,000 h ndei the Turkish rule Zuhab yielded, with its dependencies, an annua sum of 30,000 tumans, but it then included several fertile and extensive districts, which are now detached from it, and there were also 652above 2,000 raiyats resident upon the land; whereas at present this number is reduced to about 300 families, and the great proportion of the cultivation is in the hands of Guran Illyats, who, after sowing their grain in the spiing, move up to their summer pastures among the mountains, and leave only a few labourers, in the plains to get in the crops. The soil of Zuhab is naturally very rich ; but, owing to the little care bestow- ed on its cultivation, a tenfold return is considered as good. Manure is never employed to fertilise the lands. After the production of a rice- crop, the soil is allowed to lie fallow for several years, in order to reco ver its strength, or is only sown with a light grain. The interval be tween two rice crops upon the same ground is never less than seven years, but even this is said to exhaust the soil. Wherever the extent of the lands will admit of it, an interval of fifteen years is allowed. “ The grain of Zuhab is principally disposed of to Arab and Turkish traders from Baghdad. They buy it as it lies stacked upon the ground, and conveying it to Baghdad upon mules and camels, without paving any export duty, realise a considerable profit. Scarcely a fifth part of the arable land in this district is now under consideration, and certainly the revenues might be raised, with proper care, to ten times their pres ent amount. “ The town of Zuhab was built about a hundred years ago by a Tur kish Pasha, and the government continued to be hereditary in his family till the conquest of the Pashalik by the Persians. The capital was sur rounded by a mud wall, and may have at first contained about 1,000 houses.
