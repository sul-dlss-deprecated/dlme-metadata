Colonel Gordon Loch, Political agent, Bahrain. After Compliments I am writing to inform you that I have received information to the effect that if any person of our subjects goes to Bahrain on business and return, and when any person in Bahrain files a suit or a claim against him during his stay in Bahrain, he is appre hended by you and his return to his country delayed during the period of the hearing of the case in Bahrain. You are aware that by the Grace of God and endeavour of His Majesty the King, there exists sufficient number of Law Courts and Customary Courts in our country. As a practice, the case starts in the country of the defendant. Many claims and suits filed by people of Bahrain against our subjects have been settled by us according to justice and equity. By the Grace of God not a single person received injustice in our hands. On receiving the information, I did not like to raise the matter to His Majesty the King but considered it advisable to communicate to you. Under the circumstances, God willing, if any person lias a cla im, big or small, against any person from among our subjects, he will come to us direct or through you according to the prevalent custom between you and us. You will write to us about the matter and we in return will inform you what actually happens. The case will either be referred to the Shara* or the Customary Courts on its merits, and if a person has a proved claim and the defendant has no acceptable excuse the claim will at once be paid to the plaintiff. I hope you will pay your jtind attention to this matter and I believe you will do.— -Does this refer to any particular cases ? If not, what is the intention underlying this ? 18.2.33 P.A. I presume Case No.2377 of 1932 frolflgi is the out^owe of this. The defendant is an influential man,for whom Qusaibi Letter No.199 dated the 19th Neb. 193t has already been issued to P.R. 2* In our courts, while accepting a case we determine it by the place where the causs of action arose. Gases in which transactions are made outside Bahrain, are not entertained by our courts. As regards this point did not arise in the past so as to know their decisions. By an unofficial enquiry I understand that there is no ruling in Shara* that a case must start in the country of the defendant but a case can start whereever two parties meet and if there is court U. ^ stood surety and it is possible that the defendant himself approached Ibn Jiliwi, who sent this fetter. P .A the/ooint of view of Shara f and Customary courts, rno . Jj55 Political Agenty, Bahrain, the 19th February 1933. From, Lieut. Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To* The Eon f ble the Political Reoident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have t^e honour to enclose a copy of a letter dated the 15th February 1933 (20th Shawwal 1351), which I have received from Abdullah oin Jiluwi, the Amir of Hasa, regarding the procedure to be observed in dealing with claims against Hasawis. 2. I understand that the letter is possibly the outcome of a particular case, and am looking into the matter. 3. The letter is, apart from any question of law, curiously worded (especially the reference to not raisdng the question with His Majesty the King^and any answer will require careful consideration. 4. In the meantime I do not wish to appear discourteous, so propose to reply, just before I leave for Sharjah, saying that I have received his letter but am going away for a time, and mentioning old times in a friendly way. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut. Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.No. lo%W-\ of 1351 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No: 19 l J Gated the 19th rehruary 193B,enclosing a copy of a letter from iibaullah bin Jiluwi,the Amir of Hasa,regarding the proceaure to be observed in dealing with claims against Iiasawis,! have the honour to inform you that his Lxceliency Shaikh lismad bin Isa Al Khalifah has received a letter couchen m similar terms. L. I understand mat the case which gave rise to the communication is probably one in connection with an influential Losri. 3. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah is inclined to recommend that the matter should be referred to liis tiajesty the King of 3a T udi Arabia,but 1 have not yet had the opportunity of ciscussing the natter with him,as I have not yet been able to get back the case from the aahis Court,since I do not wish to appear to be interested in it. i. I have some ihea that this is a plot by Muhammad al Tawwil,aesigned to oring Abdullah bin Jiluwi into trouble with His Majesty the King of Sa T udi Arabia. I cannot at present say whether there is anything for this suspicion,but report it as it may be useful to you to know of the possibility.

The Political Agent, BAHRAIN• MEMORANDUM. Reference your letter No. 199 of 19th February. 2. Bin Juluwi* s letter, like moot Arabic missives, is obscure. What Bin Jiluwi means, I suppose, is that claims of Bahrainis against Hasawis in cases the causes of which lie in Nejdi territory, should be tried by Nejdi Courts and not by you as Political Agent, Bahrain. But Hasawis, like other Nejdis, come under your jurisdiction by the Order in Council. As you say, any reply will require careful consideration. In the meantime the interi m answer indicated in your paragraph 4 would seem to meet the case. If Bin Jiluwi pursues the matter, or even without his pursuing it, if you think fit, you might ask him to send somebody on his behalf to explain in a friendly way exactly what he does mean.
