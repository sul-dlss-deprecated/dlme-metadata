He has no landed property in British India and lives in Karachi for about 6 months in the year. His family is at his native place and he is living alone in Karachi in a rented house. 3. He is outwardly dealing in dates which he imports from Arabia but his real profession is smuggling into British India contraband Boseki Silk manufactured in China. He smuggles this quality of silk in very large quantities from Dubai on the Arabian Coast by country craft* 4. I am reliably informed that he has been carrying on this business of smuggling for the last 6 years at least. His arrangements in this connection are very well organised. 5. After several unsuccessful attempts by the preventive Department of His Ttajesty 9 s Customs and the Karachi Police the latter in consultation with the Customs authorities have recently succeeded in seizing 30 packages containing 740 pieces of contraband Boseki Silk which he smuggled ashore into British India at Buloji, a small fishing village about 80 miles from Karachi. He was bringing these goods to Karachi by lorry specially made by him for this purpose. The value of the goods seized was Rs. 14,800.A and the duty due amounted to Rs. 12,776/9/-. a copy of the order of the Collector of Customs convicting him in the above case is submitted herewith. 6/- Reliable information from more than one source indicates that he has been smuggling such quantities at least twice a month during the non-monsoon season. This indicates that he has very probably been defraud ing Government of a revenue between one and half to two lakhs of rupees for several years. The only punishment for smuggling by sea is a fine up to Rs«l?000/- and confiscation of the goods. Hence action under the foreigners 9 Act is very essential. 7/- in the above circumstances, he appears to be an undesirable foreigner fit for deportation.

Collector of Customs, Custom House, KARACHI. T o Through His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Bush ire, The Political Agent, Bahrain. CONFIDENTIAL . No.31/37. Dated the 7th March, 193 7. SECRET. Sir, tfith reference to the conversation which Mr.Shsr pies, Assistant Collector of Customs on special duty had with you in Bahrain, I have the honour to forward information to prove the complicity of certain Arabs in smuggling silk into Brit ish India. On 4-12-1936 one Yusuf s/o Marzook, caste Arab, a native of Kuwait attempted to smuggle silk into Karachi but his consignment was seized and he was convicted, A copy of the judgment is enclosed and he has allowed the period of appeal to lapse without making an appeal. He has paid the redemption fine for tie silk and the personal penalty. In his statanent he has said that the silk was brought by him from Dubai, and as you yourself know from an account of tte silk owned by him and captured by an Iranian Government sloop early in February, Dubai is used by this man as a Warehouse where he keeps goods until a convenient opportunity arises and he can smuggle them into other countries. 2. The extent of /usufs trade is shown by the following, from a soiree tfiich is sitirely trustworthy. Note: The price of a piece of silk C. I.F. (without duty) /- 2 - 7 (ft duty) Bombay is about Rs.22/- or ’8.23/- Dat e. 29-1-37 29.1 # 37. 30-1-37 2.3.37. 5.2.37. From Bombay to Kuwait: 700 pieces silk had gone and 300 were to be sent s. bsequently. From Bombay to Dubai: 2000 pieces hbd been purchased for him. Another dealer: 400 pieces were arriving for him in Bombay and 600 were to be bought out of bond. Another thousand spoken of. From Calicut: Since Goverment is becoming aware of the matter the shipment of ’’woods** is difficult, ’’Woods” means tea as will be seen in a later reference from Calicut, and shipments are being made without the sanction of the Tea Licensing Committee. From Bombay: Yusuf was debited Rs. 1,50,000. Probably a mistake for Rs. 15,000, Repeated information about silk bought for him under date 29.1.37. 8.2.37. Has sent Rs.13,000/- to Bombay. 1600 and 800 pieces to go to Dubai out of recent purchases. From Calicut: Will inform Yusuf about tea shipped from Calicut, there is no more difficult now as under 30.1.37. 26.2.37. From Bombay: Congratulations on safety of boat from Iran Government, Yusuf to remit 30,000 (Krans or rupees not shown) and shipments to be made to Dubai. 7.3.37. From Calcutta: Tea is going to be sent to Merenkanir. 14.3.37. From Dubai: Tells of sailing of 1320 pieces belonging to Yusuf. Note: It is learnt here in Karachi that the silk seized by the Iran Government and subsequently released has all been smuggled into Karachi. This shipment is probfsbly part of it.(K 0 -3- Date. /-N Arrangements are being made for the providing of manufactured manifests, presumably to prevent more captures through lack of manifests as in Iran case. Yusuf spends 6 or 7 months of each year (during the non-monsoon period) in Karachi; with him also stay his full brother Mahomed and his half-brother Fahad. rnmmmmmm ■ I believe he has another half-brother called Hamad. His agents at Dubai are (l) Murshid ——- (2) Saleh Haj i Musa and at Sharjah Abdul Rahman Hamood Sana. A copy of the letter sent to the Sind Government asking for Yusuf 1 s deportation is enclosed. A partner with Yusuf in his smuggling activities is Abdul Rehman Shahin, Arab of Kuwait. He has never been formally convicted of an offence but there is sufficient evidence to show his connection with the gang. In 1936 information was received that smuggled silver was concealed in his house. His house was searched, and — L^^ .^ Ui ,..&gt;,&gt;^«**™******''** though no silver was found, a large quantity of i cigarettes was confiscated as it was proved that duty had not been paid. In May 1936, the Customs were making N enquiries into the abnormal export of silk piece-goods in Bond to the Persian Gulf ports. In this connection Abdul Rehman 55ah Shahin was called, and the following is his examination in chief before the Assistant Collector of Customs for Preventive Service. Q. Vhat is your name ? A. My name is Abdulrehaan Shahin Alganim. q. What is your business ? A* Merchant and commission agent, q. That is your native place ? A. Kuwait. My father and brother are there. 14.3.37. 13.3.37. (“f 3-4- Q. When did you come to Karachi ? A. About 20 years ago. Do you ever go to the Persian Gulf ? A. Yes. I go there every year, i.e. to Kuwait, Basra and Bagdad. q. Have you been to Bandar Abbas ? A. I have been once there. q. Have you been to Dubai and Gutar ? A. Yes, about four years ago. q. Do you know any merchant there ? A. Yes. q. To which port do you mostly send goods and what are they ? A. I send chr.rcoal to Bagdad and. silk piece-goods to Dubai, and rice to any port in Persian Gulf, q. Prom what ports do you import goods ? A. I import dates as well as silver from Basra, q. Who is your muccadam ? A* Sultan. I have never had my Customs work done by any other muccadam. q. When did you send silk piece-goods to Persian Gulf ports ? A. I have sent about 80-90 cases within the last six months. The last consignment of 20 cases by ’’Pateh Rehman', tind&amp;l daman. I sent 33 by a country craft, perhaps Tysir (l am not sure) tindal Mahmoed. q. When did you send these 33 cases ? A. About a month and a half ago. q. To whom did you send ? A. To one Abdul 3&amp;na, Uahshed Asami, Merchant, Dubai.K- t' / (i!) - /O -5- Did you get any order from him for these goods ? A. No. I sent it on my own account. Q. fhat does he do with these goods ? A. They are sold to Persian merchants who go there to buy in small lots and smuggle them into Persia as there are restrictions for the import of silk piece-goods into Persia. Does the merchant, after selling the goods, sendthe money to you ? A. He sends it to my father at Kuwait and renders an account for it. Q. What is your father’s name . His name is Shahin (s/o Mahomed) Alganim, Merchant, Kuwait. Q. How does your father send the money ? A. He sends it through passengers coming to Karachi in Govern ment of India currency notes. Q. Do you give Dubai merchant any commission ? One per cent. q. How many pieces were contained in the 33 cases ? A. I think there were 1,260. q. Where did you purchase them ? A. 1,010 were imported direct from Bombay by me and 250 purchased locally from Messrs. Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Ltd. q. The goods came in February and were shipped in March. Gan you say where they were lying during this period ? A. I do not know anything about customs formalities. My muccadam knovs. I presume they were bonded. q. What instructions did you give to the muccalam ? A. I gave him the delivery order and left it to him to bond and ship tae goods as he thought would be best to my advantage. I could exactly tell him when the goods were to be shipped to the Persian Gulf as we have to wait for a craft I to /- 6 - tv Q- A. 1- A. Q. A. A* q. A. q- A. q* A. q- A. to be available for their transport. Did you get any craft for one month ? No. I asked several t indals but none was prepared to take, 'tffty did you not send the goods by steamer ? Steamer charges are very heavy, about Rs.15/- per case against Rs.5/- per case per country craft. Did you give any other instructions to Sultan in regard to these goods ? No. I leave it entirely to him to do what he likes. I have given him the power of attorney and I trust him. He has been with me ever since I came here. Vhen you trust Sultan how have two of the five bills of entry regarding 33 packages been put in by muccadam Chatomal. This is because Dhannamal Udharam in whose name the goods were shipped wanted his own muccadam to make some money* Who is this Dhannamal Udharam ? He is a commission agent doing business in some Provident Pund. ^ How did you come to know him ? He is a partner with one Hamood in his bussiness of 4 A commission agents anu I came to know him through Hamood. Have you ever seen Dhannamal ? I have only seen him once but I make my arrangements with Haraood. Thy did you not import and export these goods in your own name ? I used to do so before but recently the Customs have been strict regarding sureties. They have rejected the surety of /-7- Q- A. q- A. q- A, q- A. q. A. q- A. q- A. of Yuauf and Fahid Marzook who used to sendgoods like myself to Persian Gulf and therefore I thought that on account of these reasons I could not send the goods in my name . Once I sent some goods with the surety of a local bank but the neoct time the bank refused to stand surety for me. Therefore I talked over this matter with Hamood who undertook to arrange with Dhannamal to import and export the goods in the latter’s name and with Udharam Mulchand to stand surety. What are your relations with Hamood ? He is a friend of mine and also comes from Kuwait. Have you paid anything to Hamood for his services ? I have not paid to Hamood directly but he will get his share as partner in the businessof commission agents with Dhannamal• What is the commission you give ? One t ,er cent. Do you know Udharam liulchand ? Yes I know him. How did 3ultan, your muccadara go to Dhannamal without instruct ions from you ? r a c* * ^ 4 * ^ 1 I had told him to goto Hamood, and Hamood did the rest. How long afcoes it take a country craft to reach Dubai? It depends on the favourable winds in the seas. It may be anything from one to four months. I do not understand why you did not import and export the goods in your own name. If there was any trouble about surety, the same person who has stood surety now could have stood surety then, i.e. you did not want a different person to show himself as an exporter of the goods ? It was Udharam Mulchand who wanted that he should have another person whom he knew as the importer and exporter of goods. He may have t hbught that by this means he would have /Bfer - 8 - have greater control over the goods and some control over the tindals. I still do not understand. By this means he simply increas ed his responsibility in the bond in case of failure of a certificate, which he would share with you if he permitted you to put the shipping bill in your name ? 1 cannot say. TSvidently he trusted Hamood and though he would have the certificates produced. Why could not then Hamood be shown as the exporter ? Haraood’s name was not put in because he has very little business in the Custom House. Dhannamal has also little business in the Custom House. 1 cannot answer this. I do not know what Hamood had in mind. I left everything to Hamood and he arranged every thing. At what profit does the Dubai man sell the silk piece- goods ? He makes about Rs.-/12/- to l/- per piece. When is the certificate granted at that port ? The certificate is granted after landing of goods. Are the goods examined before certificates are granted ? No. Th€jy are not examined. They see the cases and their marks. What is the Customs duty at that port ? It is about Hs.2/5/- per cage or package irrespective of the contents. This is strictly not duty at all. It is only labour charges for the landing and carriage of the goods. Sometimes the goods are again taken from there to otncr ports in the Persian Gulf as for instance, Katir, Alzahir, Kuwait. /f ■ mmm rnssm fi, s' It © - 10 - A. No, not necssaarily. They are stored just as apace permits. You keep an account of the money received from the Dubai merchant through your father ? A. Yea, I keep an account. Q,. So far nave you received any money this season ? A. Yes. I have received for the first two lots. q. I presume your account books are in Arabic ? A. Yes. q. Gan you produce them ? A- At present they are at my head office, i.e. my father’s shop at Kuwait. At the time of Muharram all the years accounts are closed. I shall be going there at the end of this month, and will return about August, when I shall bring these books. I can then produce the books. q. Fas any surety rejected by Customs in your case at any time? A. No. 3ut on hearing about the rejection of Yusuf and Fahad ^lar^ook, I thoqght I should also make some other arrangement to vvhaw I used to do formerly. q. Last year you gave Sultan as your surety. Was he refused this year ? A. I did not produce him this year for the above reason. Also Sultan himself told me he would not like to stand as s ur ety. 1 MUR SHIP . Murahid who is Yusuf’s Dubai agent had refused to pay hush money to Jasin Mohamed Dokhan of ^ubai and the latter has been threatening Abdul ehman and asking for these payments to be continued. Again, Abdul Rehman showed a great interest in the recent Iranian capture, and he was asked by agents of his in Gutch as to whether this # capture had really taken plaoe - ^ \ Abd tL? ellman ha8 been shipping tea from Calicut and is i3! lo © -Il ia in touch with Mur ah id. He deals with the man at Calicut ;ho supplied Yusuf Marzook with tea. A connection has been proved between Abdul Rehman and Mohamed Ismail who was convicted together with Yusuf in the seizure by the Karachi Police last December. (See judgment. Abdul Rehman tells of business deals carried out by Mohd. Ismail). Abdul Rehman was asked to make arrangements in Karachi if the first shipment of tea from Kathiawar to Yemen was enquired into by Karachi Customs* On 5-4-37 boom 'Sambban', t indal Abdul Riza arrived at this port. The vessel was bound for Dubai and had on board 47 cases of silk piece-goods shipped by one Hussain Ssa fr om Bombay on Abdul Rehman Dhahin's account. Hussain Esa is known to be the agent of Yusuf Marzook for the supply of silk piece- goods. The arrival of boom M r&gt;ambhan ,? at this port is very suspieious. It is probably that, but for the police and Customs cordon recently created around Karachi, the contents of the 47 cases would have been landed at some unauthorised place, and the boom would then have proceeded to its destina tion. Hamood Abdul Aziz mentioned in the account given of Abdul Rehman Rhahin is an Arab born in Kuwait. He first came to our notice in the Bram Hydri saccharine case when he assisted Andulally Moosabhoy and Sons in shipping 10 cases of saccharine to Kuwait and which were eventually smuggled into Karachi. In this case he persuaded one Babulal Angarlal to sign the Customs export documents an 1 even supervised the shipment of the cases on the exporting vessel. In May 1936 the Customs authorities were enquiring into the /the abnormal shipments of silk piece-goods in ^ond to Persian Gulf ports. Hamood was questioned in this connection by the Assistant Collector for Preventive .Service and below are relevant extracts from his examination Q, Do you know Abdul Rehman Shah in ? A. Yes I know him from Kuwait, q. Did you have any business with him ? A. Yes. q t . Describe the nature of business ? A. About three or four months ago he came to me and said that he wanted to send about 10 cases Boseki silk to Dubai but was in difficulty to find a surety for Customs bond and asked me if I could produce a surety. He agreed to pay me one per cent commission for this. I went to Udharam Mulchand and explained to him the situation telling him that there was no risk whatsoever and that it was profitable business and proposing to him that I would share equally with him the one per cent commission that I was getting. He agreed and in due course the goods were shipped to Dubai, Udharam Mulchand signing as surety. q. Yere any other goods shipped after this ? A. Yes. 33 cases Boseki were shipped to Dubai. This also belonged to Abdul Rehman Shahin, and were exported through me on the same condition, surety being Udharam Mulchand. q. In whose name were the goods shipped ? A. They were shipped in the name of one Dhannamal Udharam who is doing some Provident Panel work in partnership wi th ^d har am Mul c ha nd .-13- q. 'Vhy were they not shipped in the name of Shahin ? A, Because Udharan Mulchand aaid that he did not know Shahin and therefore would not stand surety for him. He would only agree to stand surety if the shipping bill was made in the name of Bharmaxnal Udharam. Because he thought that by so doing he would bee erne knov/n as a merchant and would appear to be the owner ofthe goods to the tindals. q. Do you realise that by doing so Udharam Mulchand was taking on himself full responsibility in case of non-product ion of the certificate, because Dhannamal Udharam is a man of no means at all ? A. Yes, but 1 dn not know that Dhannamal is a man of no means at all. q. Then what can be the object of taking full responsibility instead of sharing it with Shahin. A. I cannot answer this question. It is therefore sufficiently proved that he has connection with Abdul Rehaaan Shahin and Abdoolally Moosabhoy &amp; Sons. The latter firm has already been penalized on two occasions by the Customs authorities. In order to restrict the smuggling activities of these Arabs it is necessary that they be forbidden access not only to British India but to those ports of the Persian Gulf which they use as warehouses or intermediary ports before they begin the smuggling proper. There is sufficiently strong evidence for Yusuf's deportation and I have the honour to request that the visas of the others be cancelled for British India ana tne visas of them all for Muscat, Bahrain and the Tracial Coast be withdrawn. Also that the movements of their agents may be restricted /Restricted to the actual port at which they sre working. I should be obliged too if you would make it known along the coast that previous information of a shipment of silk interid ed for smuggling into British Ind is which leads eventually to a seixure being male will be rewarded up to five hundred I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd.

SUBJECT. Smuggling - Dutiable goods landed at an unauthorised place. • • • • • Read : letter No.33U of 1936, dated 7/l2/l936 from the Assistant Superintendent of Police, City and Baghdadi Divisions, Karachi, and also the connected records of the case • CRUSH . On receipt of information that some bales of contraband silk were to be smuggled ashore into British India by Yusuf Marzook and Mohammad Ismail Haj i Dost Mohammad at Buleji — .. and brought into Karachi by motor bus via Maury pur Road on the night of the 6th instant, the Assistant Superintendent of Police, City and Baghdadi Divisions, Karachi, with two Deputy Superintendents of Police and two Inspectors of Police, kept a watch on the Maury pur Road on the said night when at about 12-30 a.m., he noticed motor lorry No.K. A.4874 coming from the coast cross-country followed by car No.K.A.6200. yhen these two vehicles passed the Police officers, the latter followed them in two cars at a short distance. Ult imately the cars, in which the Police officers were, managed /- 2 - 0 rr^naged to get just behind the motor lorry and were followed by the motor car in which Yusuf Marzook and Mohammad Ismail Haj i Dost Mohammad were seated. Suspecting that it was being followed, the motor lorry was trying to escape but was finally overtaken on Bunder Bead Extension. The vehicles were stopped and were taken under Police guard to the Baghdadi Police Station vhere on a search being made of them in the presence of the mashirs, lorry No.K.A.4874, which was driven by Abdul Latif Mohammad Suleman, was found to contain 740 pieces of Boseki silk manufactured in China, packed in 50 packages. Besides, the above name! driver Abdul Lat if, two other persons viz.Isoo Jaffar and Yusuf Mohammad were in the Lorry at the time and car No.K.A.6200 contained two persons viz: Yusaf Marzook and Mohammad Ismail Haj i Dost Mohammad, the latter driving the car. 2. The Assistant Superintendent of Police took the depositions of all the 5 persons named above in his presence. He subsequently produced before me, on the forenoon of the 7th instant, all these 5 persons with the 740 pieces of silk seized and the lorry. I hsve examined these 5 persons and also verified the depositions made by them to the Assistant Superintendent of Police. 3. Yusuf Ma^zook in his deposition before the Assistant Superintendent of Police stated that the 740 pieces of silk contained in the 30 packages which were in the lorry No.K.A. 4874 belonged to him and that he smuggled them into Karacni from the Persian Gulf - Dubai. He sent lorry No.K.A.4874 with driver Abdul Latif and the other two servants Yusuf and Ismail to Buleji to fetch the goods mentioned. The car in which he followed the lorry belonged to his friend Mohammad Ismail. In his further deposition before me on the 7th instant /-3- zv also instant when the Assistant Superintendent of Police/xarauj wag present, Yusuf Marzook stated that he sent his man Abdul Rahman Ibrahim a month ago to Dubai on the Persian Gulf to buy silk, Abdul Rahman bought silk from the merchants th're and Yusuf Marzook arranged with him that he should bring the goods by country craft to a place called Bulej i on the 20th day of Ramzan corresponding to the 6th December 1936. Yusuf Marzook sent a lorry belonging to him (No.A.4874) with Abdul Lat if, Ismail and Yusaf to bring the goods. The lorry had left Karachi at about 7 p.ra. on 6/12/1936. Yusuf Marzook was not awaiting the arrival of the lorry. He had instructed his men to bring the goods to his house which is very near the Oustom House on Bori Road. At about 12-30 a.m. he spotted his lorry followed by 2 cars, and so he followed also. Then the cars stopped he got out of his car with Moham iad Ismail who was with him and there aaw the Assistant Superintendent of Police who had the Mashirnama made, and took down the statements of himself, Mohammad Ismail, Abdul Latif, Ismail and Yusaf. Mohammad Ismail was not informed by him that smuggled goods were to be brought, but he happened to be with Yusuf Marzook when the latter noticed the lorry coming. The small car in which he and Mohammad Ismail followed belonged to the latter, 4. Mohammad Ismail Haj i Dost Mohammad in his statement before the Assistant Superintendent of Police admitted that he was with Yusuf Marzook in his car and wag following lorry No.K.A.4874 which was seized by the Police on the Bunder Road. He followed the above mentioned lorry at the instructions of Yusuf Marzook. The driver of the lorry Abdul Lat if is his nephew and the lorry belonged to Yusuf Marzook. He learnt from Yusuf Marzook that the bales of silk on the lorry belonged and to hiir^that they were being smuggled into British India (Karachi). In his further statement before me, Mohammad Ismail /*2' u ''L ^ 1 &gt; 2v&gt; - 4- laraail Haj i Dost Hoham:iad stated that when he was out in his car with Yusuf Marzook and when they were driving, he asked Yusuf Marzook why he was making him to drive about and that xusuf told v ^ Marzook iJBxk him that some goods of his were coming, Yusui Marzook did not tell him that they were smuggled goods. Mohammad Ismail Haj i Dost Mohammad had a suspicion in his own mind that the goods might be such. He definitely learnt of the go o&lt;fe being smuggled goods only when he and Yusuf Marzook were near the lorry which was stopped when the Police were on the scene. 5. The driver of the lorry Abdul latif Mohmoraad Buleman deposed before the Assistant 'jhperintendent of Police that Yusuf Marzook purchased lorry No.K,A.4874 and gave it to him, and that the bales of silk seized from the lorry belonged to Yusuf Marzook. Abdul Latif Mohammad Suleraan brought the silk bales in question from Bulej i under instructions from Yusuf Marzook who had asked him to take the bales to Daddar where he would give him further instructions for their storage. The two persons who accompanied tne driver on the lorry were Yusuf and Ismail «/ho were fishermen by caste and were servants of Yusuf Marzook. In his further statement before me Abdul Latif Md.Suleman stated that his instructions were that if he did not find Yusuf at Haddar, he should go to his house. 6. Is oo Jaffar and Yusuf Mohammad who were in the lorry with the driver at the time the lorry was seized by the Police stated before the Assistant Superintendent of Police that they were servants of Yusuf Marzook and accompanied lorry No.K.A. 4874 to fetch contraband bales of silk from Bulej i which belorged to Yusuf Marzook. 7. The silk seized is Puj i quality of Chinese manufacture and the 740 pieces weigh lbs.3584 ozs.6 ard are worth Rs.14,800/- ex.duty. The Customs duty leviable thereon amounts to Rs.12,776/9/0. 8 . /8. As, according to the admission of the accused persons, this constituted a clear case of landing, at an unauthorised place in British India, of dutiable goods imported fr cm a foreign port and of their being smuggled into 'British India without payment of Customs duty thereon - offences punishable under clauses 2 and 3 of section 167, Sea Customs Act - I called upon the 5 persons named above to show cause why the 740 pieces of silk in question and the lorry in v/hich they were removed should not be confiscated and e&amp;ch of them be penalized in the sum of Rs,1000/-. 9. Yusuf Marzook in his explanation, dated 12th December 1936, pleads for mercy. He states that this was the first offence committed by him without knowing the consequences and that he committed the offence under a misapprehension. He requests that as he had spoken the truth from the beginning to the end and confessed his guilt, he may be dealt with lenient ly. 10. It is true that Yusuf Marzook confessed his guilt when he was caught by the Police with the goods but I fail to under stand what else he could have done in the circumstances. The smuggling was deliberately planned by him and he would have succeeded in his plan to defraud Government of their dues but for the timely action taken by the Police. Instances o. smuggling of dutiable silk piece-go xls from Gutch and Persian Gulf ports by country craft have been recently noticed and such cages require deterrent penal action. I therefore order that the 7 40 pieces of silk seized in this case be confiscated under clause 2 of Section 167, f&gt;ea Customs Act, subject to their being redeemed on payment of a fine of Rs.14,800 (rupees fourteen thousand and eight hundred only) imposedunder section 183, Sea Customs Act, and on payment of the duty due, which amounts /&lt;2 &gt; l/y amounts to Hs.12 f 776/9/0. I also order that the lorry No.K.A. 4874 in which tiie silk pieces were removed be confiscated unier section 168, Sea Customs Act, read with clause 2 of section 1^7 ibid . The lorry may be redeemed on payment of a fine of Rs.300/-( three hundred only) imposed under section 183. I impose on Yusuf Marzook a direct penalty of Rs.1000/- (rupees one thousand only) under clause 3 of section 167, Sea Customs Act. sd. R.J.Kdraka Offg.

Sir, Muhammad Yusuf alias Yusuf, son of Marzook, Arab of Kuwait Arabia - Deportation of — I have the honour to report that the individual named above is a resident of Kuwait in Arabia and is a foreigner within the meaning of Section 1 of the Foreigners 1 Act III of 1864. 2. He has no landed property in British India and lives in Karachi for about 6 months in the year. Kis family is at his native place and he is living alone in Karachi in a rented houo e. 3. He is outwardly dealing in dates which he imports from Arabia but his real profession is smuggling into British India contraband Boseki silk manufactured in China. He smuggles this quality of silk in very large quantities from Dubai on the Arabian Coast by country craft. 4. I am reliably informed that he has been carrying cn this business of smuggling for the laet 6 years at least. His arrangements in this connection ©re very well organised. 5. After sevecalunsucceasful attempts by the Preventive Department of His Majesty’s Customs and the Karachi Police, the latter in consultation with the Customs authorities have recently succeeded in seizing 30 packages containing 740 pieces of contraband Boseki silk which he smuggled ashore into British India at Buleji, a small fishing village about 20 miles from Karachi. /- 2 - •vj-.'s &lt;y &gt; 7 Karachi. He \?as bringing these ^oodo to Karachi by lorry specially made by him for this p*irpoae. The value of the goods seized v/&amp;s Ha.14,800/- and the uty due amounted to 1^3.12,776/9/- A copy of ^he 'Order of the Collector of Customs convicting him in the above case is submitted here with. 6. Reliable information from more than one source indicates that he has been smuggling such quantities at least twice a month during the non-raonsoon season. This indicates that he has very probably been defrauding Government of a revenue between one and half to two lakhs of rupees for several years. The only punishment for smuggling by sea is a fine up to Rs.1000/- and confiscation of the goods. Hence action under the ]?oreigners t Act is very essential. 7. In the above circumstances, he appears to be an undesirable foreigner fit for deportation. I therefore request you to move the Government of Sind to pags orders for his deportation to Kuwait under section 3 of the Foreigners’ Act III of 1864. 8. I suggest that he may be ordered to remove himself from British India by the first available steamer after the j service of the order of deportation. I enclose a co.&gt;y of the draft order for consideration. 9. Very early orders are requested as further consignments of smuggled goods are expected.

I inform you that Shahin is an old man and I do not remember that any travel document is in his possession, becuase he has left Kuwait for a numberof years. As regards Mohammed al-Marzook. He is now at Karachi trading there, and for some years he has not come to Kuwait. As regards Hamad al-Marzook. He is one of the Kuwait merchants, and he travelled to nowhere but to Basra.

The annual visa which he previously held for Iraq was sometime ago cancelled in accordance with your instructions contained in your above quoted letter, as also the visas held by those of the persons named in your letter who were here at the time or have since returned to Kuwait. 2. Yusuf Marzook states that he has important business interests in Iraq which warrant his presence there. This is independently confirmed and I pass on his request for disposal as you see fit. 3* I venture to add that should you see your way to sanctioning the grant of the visa applied for (or preferably a new Certificate of Identity), the possibility of the man’s working his way back into India or places on the iirab Coast of the Persian Gulf could be effectively guarded against by inserting a remark in the validity column of his document- 2 • that it was not valid for any country other than Iraq.

I learnt last evening that Yusuf Marzook had shipped 310 cases and 50 bags of Indian tea in 3 consignments, one of 200 cases, one of 110 cases and 50 bags, to Aden by s.s.Bamora, also that he has been shipping Indian tea to Iraq. The following points have also come to my knowledge (1) Yusuf I.iarzook, Pahad Marzook and Abdul Rahman Bhahin are partners, the last named being still at Karachi. (2) The tea packed in receptacles used for dried fish is con veyed by lorry to a port of Kathiawar and places on the Malabar Coast where the booms owned by them are loaded and sail for Kuwait. Large numbers of these booms have arrived here during May. (3) That Mohamad Thanaiyan, a well to do merchant of good standing^was in partnership with the abovenamed. I can hardly believe this as the Thanaiyan family are the most respected merchants here. (4) It is common knowledge in the town that the three first named have done a large amount of smuggling in India. (5) Abdul Rahman Shahin brought consignment of tea in a boomu&gt; boom owned by him and Mohamed Thanaiyan to l&gt;ubai where it was landed for re-export. His agent in lubai is Suleiman Jassim.

He says that although it is true that Yusuf Murzook is his brother, he has no business connections with him at all, since the death of his father seventeen years ago. With regard to his case of the three hundred bags of nuts containing tea, the owner of the goods cofessed before the Assistant Collector of Customs, Karachi and was fined Rupees 20/- or 25/-. His name is Abdulla Al-Matrook, and at that time he, Fahad, acted as his interpreter. With regard to the sunken vessel he says that the vessel really sunk and the fact was mentioned in the newspaper 'Sind Observer' and possibly in some other newspapers. Also the Commander of a steamer reported as having seen the vessel sunk to the Karachi Port authorities. He, Fahad, wrote about the matter to the Chief Customs Officer Port Okha and to the Tea Licencing Committee who also referred him to the Chief Customs Officer, Port Okha. The censored letters do not seem to have anything incriminating in them. 2 . The case against Fahad therefore does not seem to me, on this evidence, to be very strong, and if he is 'suspected' only on this evidence, I think that the withholding of his Visa to India any longer is hardly justified. He has been prevented from going to India for some seven months and his (legitimate) business has been Captain T.Hickinbotham, I.A., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.ns considerably upset. If he has been smuggling and I do not think that he is guiltless, he is not likely to do so again, at any rate for some time. 1909, as I note from a letter referring to his father as Trade Agent to the Sheikh and merchants of Koweit in Karachi, letter No.165 of 26/2/1919 to the Civil Commissioner Bagdad from the Political Agent, Koweit. His family and business connections being so long established there, it seems to me to be ineqvitable to prevent his return any longer unless we have some quite definite evidence to go on. tfith regard to Shahin Mohammed al Ghanim it is true that he must be privy to his son’s transactions, but I doubt his taking his son’s place in active smuggling because he is between eighty and eighty-five and looks it. He walks slowly with a stick and is a gentle old man, who has now n got to a sleepy age”. He does not require a Visa for India and indeed his range is about 500 yards only. 4 . With regard to Abdul Rahman Hamood Sana I agree that his case can best be straightened out by reference to his Agent at Sharja. The family has been established in India sinceD.O.Ncu C~ 3^o onfldontlal Political agency, Koweit• The 30th December, 1^57. / ;ould you please refer to your letter No. 34 S 5 / 55 / 97 of 11 th lecocibar, 19D7. The report night give the i .presaion that all ICoweit craft are snuggling craft, which is not so. The total numtufcc of Koweit dhows engaged in the winter carrying trade is about IID, and most of these are engaged in legitimate trade. In the autumn they sail, as soon as the dat€*s are ripe* from Basra for India; most of the dates being tfiken by Yusif al Buqur, a Koweiti merchant established in Caliout for that purpose. There, or elsewhere on the Malabar coast, the ships are louden with such things as teak wood, mango wood, coir and rope. These are taken to the Persian Gulf or to ndan or Hodaida, if they are near Gaihut or Kakalla in Bouth ^rabia, they may take fish oil for the Persian Gulf orts. /hen sailing for the Ted Gea from India, they often loan at Mangalore with tiles and bricks, which they take to Zanzibar. From there they bring wood for roof-beams and boat-ribs. dates to India, taking interim cargoes from India to the Ked Sea or Zanzibar, and returning to the Gulf before the monsoon with wood from India and Zanzibar and fish oil from. Jouth Arabia. Briefly the Koweit fleet is engaged in taking Captain T.ITickinbotham, I.a., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf- 2 - «•} No Koweiti ships to Calcutta. The only well known Arab merchants of whom I have heard in Calcutta are the Bassam family of Nejd, descendants of a very long line of merchant princes which has family branches in Damascus and Cairo, and legitimately exports tea from Calcutta to various Indian ports. Isa bin Sultan bin Isa and his brother Hamad. They were caught smuggling two years but by steamer and not by country craft”. Isa was sentenced to imprisonment but not for smuggling. it at Port Oka or the Kathiawar ports, but the Rule Koweit having had his attention drawn to this praos agreed to cooperate in stopping it (Cee my letter No.C-284 of 1st December, 1957) and in any case this '’trade” has already greatly decreased owing to ant-smuggling measures taken in India. 4 # /ith regard to the names mentioned in the report (1) rvbdul Kariu bin Abood (Abul it should be) is one of the oheiAh of Aoweit’s treasurers. He has never been to India, nor have any of his family. (2) Muhammad Saleh Kamezi. Mohammad Saleh al Kumaidhi died in about 1907.

Most of the trade of the first named is undoubtedly legitiiMite, but he may have financed aorta smuggling enterprises at times in the past. The second is not a smuggler. (7) ifalahi, is presumably Palish al .Ihirafi, father of the second namec above. He has property at ^asbah in Iran, exports Lis own uatss, us'ually direct to Lsmibar; is very old fashioned and is not a smuggler. /l^-l ( 8 ) Lhahi Ganam (Lhahin bin 1 ohe^amacy^lianiia) is aged 100 (not 3b aa reported in ay letter Ho.C-094 of 10 th Decamber, 19^7) and believed to be the oldest inhabitant of Loweit.

I would point out that it is generally reported here that an Indian, Mohammad Ismail son of Dost Monnna , an Afghan by origin, living in lUipier road Karachi, is the ’’Master Mind” of the smugglers, and ta&gt;:es of the-5- \o\ net profit iiade by the siuiiiSglers. If i-iis activities could be stopped, smuggling would, I understand, be dealt a severe blow. I hear that his son t-abaul Lhalio ?) was actually in the lorry full of smuggled goods in which Yusif Murzook was caught by the Karachi Police last year. Basing my suggestion on local information, i therefore recommend special attention should be paid to Muhammad Ismail’s activities. Yours sincerely, sd.

As I have 'been in business at Karachi for the last thirty years, first with my late father and la^er on my own, my business connections are well established there and it will be impossible for me to do business anywhere else. Therefore I pray that my case may be forwarded to the proper quarters for reconsideration, and I hope that, with your kind help, it will be settled satisfactorily.

READ:- Special Divisional Inspctor T s report rh ted 6.1,44 READ:- Assistant Collector Preventive’s note dated 11.2.44 and also the connected records of the case. Order . On 26.1.44 information was received ha the Intelligence Branch of the Custom House that one Abdul Rahim 'li Khan would/attemp to export prohibited and restricted goods to muscat via Gadani. It was later ascertained that the goods would be loaded on three c; feels no would be accompanied by one Abdul Aziz bin Haroon and Suleman bin Issa. 2. Arrangements were accordingly made on 27.1.44 to intercept the goods and a party of Customs Officers proceeded in the direction of the Hub Road for the pur-pose. They intercepted the caravan consisting of three camels laden with twelve packages. The caravan v/as accompanied by Abdul Aziz, Suleman hinxfxxx and Dost Kohomed the . owner of the camels. A superficial examination of the packages xkxkxx revealed that they contained a considerable assortment of merchand ise- mainly articles the export of which from India is prohibited except under a licence. A search of the persons accompanying the caravan was conducted and a cover containing some letters was recovered' from the pocket of Suleman, The letters,on casual examin ation revealed that they referred to the goods ap rehended. The men and the goods were brought to the Custom House for further investigation.(2) ■. . ■ v53&gt; /15. iq-j, c. In his st teiaent dated 17,1,44 recorded before the Special idvisionel Inspector Abdul Aziz bin Haroon admitted ownership of o port!Oil oj. '‘die eoods end stated thaj&amp; they were being,exported to luscat via Gadani. He declared that the value of the goods was h?34i x. Suleman bin Is.sa at first disclaimed all knowledge about the goods and stated that he was merely accompanying the caravan to Gadani. He admitted, however* the fact‘of his being in possession of a cover aooressed to one nohomed Haroon of Huscat. When questioned ' 0 ' Ul ' LU i s letter he stated that it was given to him by Abdul Aziz at the time the caravan was intercepted by Customs Officers. ' Tne camel-man Dost lohomed deposed that his three camels were hired for conveying some goods to'Bundowar ( A small place near Gadani) for a sura of Hs.S/- per camel. He stated that the goods were loaded from a house near Gandhi Gardens and that he thought that the two men accompanying the caravan were the owners of the goods. 4. The cover when opened was found to contain four letters in Arabic, all of which related to the goods under detention and clearly indicated that the goods were destined for Muscat and Kuweit. The writer in each case was Abdul Rahim Ali Khan. In two of the letters Suleman was mentioned as the carrier of the goods. J1 Suleman was again contacted and interrogated in the j-ight oi the information gleaned from the letters. He then confessed that his previous statement was false and admitted that the goods were handed over to him by Abdul Rahim to be taken to Gwader and there handed over to his brother Mohomed Haroon. He also admitted having received the letters from Abdul Rahim. Aboul Rahim Ali Khan whose statement was recorded on 5.2.44 admitted that all the goods seized except those claimed by Abdul Aziz are his own property and .that he was sending them to Lius cat via Gadani through Suleman. He also admitted handing over a cover containing four letters to Suleman. Ahaul Rahim and Abdul Aziz admit in their statements that they attempted to export prohibited and restricted goods to Muscat via \ Gaoani on the night of 27th January 1944. A list of the goods shoeing their values is appended to this order. Suleman did not own any goods but he was the ap ointed carrier. The letters written by ul nahim not only fully corroborate^ this but also reveal that.. . , .that an attempt ’'as to be made tq defraud the Customs authorities at muscat and Kuweit and to evade the Import Control Regulations at those ends,. 7, The circumstances of this case leave no room for doubt that • a determined and well planned attempt was te—made to export restricted goods out of India without a licence to the Persian Gulf norts of Huscat and Kuweit via Gadani and Gwadur. The offence of contravening the rules made by Government under rule 34(5) of the Defence of India Rules is established with reference to rule 181 % of the Defence'of India Rules. I therefore confiscate the goods and impose on Abdul Rahim Ali Khan a personal penalty of Rs.DOQQ/- (Rupees five-thousand) only and on Abdul Aziz bin Haroon one of Rs.500/.^(Rupees five-hundred) only under section 167 clause 8 of the Sea Customs Act. The goods in the two lots will^hovever, be alio' ed to be redeemed under section 185 ibid on payment of a redemption fine of Rs.4500/-(Rupees fourthousand &amp; fivehundred)only In the case of those belonging to Abdul Rahim All Khan and of Rs.450/-(Rupees fourhundred and fifty) only in the case of those belonging to Abdul Aziz.
