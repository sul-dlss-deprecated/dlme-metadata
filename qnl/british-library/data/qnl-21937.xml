Political Resident, Camp Bahrain* No, C/5S4-l.a/43 Doled 19 -th Ssptsmbar 103&lt;3 In order to increase the efficiency of the defence scheme in the oil field I have suggested to the Adviser that he should have a section of six police on motor bicycles. The Adviser fully agrees and if motor bicycles can be obtained rapidly the Bahrain Government will willingly pay for their cost. 2 m Would it be possible to telegraph to the Indian Stores Depart ment to send me six army type motor bicycles at once ? If they are consigned to the Political Agent we should get the normal I.S.D. discount, and I suggest it is reasonable to do this for the Bahrain Government since so far we have organised the entire defence without one rupee cost either ta the British or Indian Governments. 3. If possible three of these motor bicycles may be fitted to take side cars, and the side cars should be sent at the same time. Perhaps it could be impressed on the Indian Stores Department that s. 6.
