I.—Events preceding the Armistice. 1. Contact with Kurdistan was established in 1917, and thenceforward till the signing of the Armistice the policy followed was inspired solely by military con siderations. 2. --(i) 7’o Khaniqin and Kifri. —Shortly after our arrival in Baghdad Mustafa Pasha Bajlan, the most prominent Kurd in Khaniqin, arrived requesting help. 'The Russians were pillaging and destroying; he himself had been insulted and robbed; unless something were done to reassure them, the Kurdish tribes, anxious as they had been for liberation from Turkish tyranny, would throw their weight on the side of their old masters to be rid of this new and more barbarous oppression. Nothing, however, could be done till the Russians had retired and the Turks were driven from their positions on the Divalah. This was accomplished in the winter campaign of 1917-18. Khaniqin, and later Kifri, were occupied, the starving people cared for, agriculture revived, and the minds of the people turned favourably towards us. They had suffered terribly. So scarce was food that wheat, barley, maize, of whatever quality, provided only it was edible, was sold at the same price. Their vines, their doors, and their lintels had been broken for firewood, and many of their menkind shot. To prevent our lines of communication being flanked by hunger-stricken brigands it was necessary to establish government. Seed was rushed up, and civil offices opened. We were committed to a measure of administration. (ii) In the late spring of 1917, just before the harvest, it was decided to drive the Turks from Kirkuk. The operations were successful and Kirkuk was entered. Unfortunately the decision not to hold Kirkuk was not reached for some days. The inhabitants—Moslem, Christian, and Jew --welcomed us warmly, and presently found themselves left to face the returning Turk. Asylum was given to those who had helped us most; but their property—villages, gardens and houses —w T as destined in revenge. We had incurred an obligation to those who had suffered for their friendship to us. (iii) On 24th October 1918 the final operations against the Turkish forces were commenced. When the armistice was signed the 18th Division had progressed to a point just outside Mosul ; Lewin’s column had advanced to Altun Keupri and a few miles beyond. II.- Events immediately succeeding the Armistice. 3. The conduct of events during the next few days was still guided by military considerations. The ground taken was to lie held; and in order to hold it the countryside had to be cleared of Turkish troops, and centres of supply had to be occupied. Sulaimaniyah, whither Sheikh Mahmud had long been inviting us, was occupied by a Turkish division. This was ordered to withdraw, and Major Noel was sent to examine into Kurdish affairs. The town of Mosul is half Kurdish, and adjacent to it are four Kurdish districts, appanages of tfie city. The landowners live in Mosul, the villagers sell their produce and buy their goods in Mosul. As we were occupying Mosul, we had of necessity to control these districts also. Lewin’s column at Altun Keupri was on the very border of the promised land ; but at Altun Keupri itself supplies were short, communications bad, and the rainy season had commenced. It was necessary to go beyond Altun Keupri to Erbil, in order to provide fuel and grain. A political office was opened at Erbil, and a detachment stationed at Kirkuk. III.—Subsequent Events. 4. From December onwards the controlling factor has been the unsettled condition of Kurdish political inclinations, aggravated by the inevitable delays of the Peace Conference. In December 1918, at a meeting at Sulaimaniyah, at which the Ihil Commissioner was present in person, the assembled Sheikhs of the area formally asked to be brought under British protection, and requested the Civil Commissioner to S 51 50 9/19o fOi is .li*. ^ t ** r ■ - i- . &lt; ' ' r * d Si? &amp; ,nim \..:» -m ,kh?fS.* 4 ^r ! ‘l wlfti ♦sni# Aiitw “ send a representative with the necessary assistants, to enable the Kurdish people “ under British auspices to progress peacefully on civilised lines.” Sheikh Mahmud a local notable, was appointed British representative in the district. In January the Committee of Kurdish Independence addressed the Peace Conference ; and various claimants, notably Sherif Pasha, whose agent, Ghalib Bey, has been despatched to canvass Kurdistan, and Sheikh Mahmud, have since pressed for the recognition of a united Kurdistan under themselves. It was to ascertain the extent of the support which this movement for a United Kurdistan could obtain that Major Noel was sent on his mission. About the same time there was started a parallel movement having as its object the recognition of an ^ independent Kurdistan consisting of large autonomous States under British suzerainty This has attracted many influential Kurds, particularly those who realise that thev cannot control a kingdom but feel they could command a province. Of these the more important are Saiyid Taha, who would stretch from above Erbil to Van ; Abdul Qadir, his rival for the same area; Simko, whose area is further to the East and tends to overspread the border into Persia ; and the brothers Badr Khan. Thus the form of government which will be set up in Kurdistan is still under discussion. As regards external control, Admiral Calthorpe, in his telegram No. 145G of (loth July, stated that the breach between the Turkish Government and the Kurds at Constantinople is already too wide to bridge. The Turks, however, continue to approach the Kurdish leaders and are reported to be considering the appointment of purely Kurdish officials for the administration of Kurdish districts. ' ouLiivu man mu a xcanocu min atmuer we nor me JXnrdisIi people were prepared to support him to the full limit of his ambitions, that he turned against us, and imprisoned the party of Britishers at Sulairnaniyah. This action resulted in military operations and the eventual rescue of the prisoners The move ment towards a pro-British Kurdistan stirred the Turk to anti-foreign pan-fslamic piopaganda ; and the activities of the C.U.P. in this direction are mainly responsible for the murders of Captain l earsou at Zakho on 7th April, and of Captains Willey and Macdonald with their British establishment at Amadia on 25th Julv. Towards ^^ eijd of July the arrival of the news that Saiyid Taha was flirting with the C.U.P. led to tne withdrawal to Batar of the political office, which had been opened at Rowanduz to secure the road for the repatriation of the Assyrians at J’ mmi , ow . yyy ;y .; IV* Orders issued by His Majesty’s Govermnent. affecting KuSu ™ 1,16 PriUCipal ° rder8 isS ' led ^ IIis Government (1) On 7th Mav, loieigu Office authorised the giving of private assurances to tlie Kurds to the effect that a vindictive policy would not be pursued against them. A (- } °th May Colonel Wilson was authorised to treat Mosul as a province of the Arab btateot Iraq, fnuged by autonomous Kurdish States under Kurdish Llnets, with British political advisers. The authority covered the ,,s n Pf ( V°i UP t '! . 11 ° t l,e y o,1 . d tjie decision of the Peace Conference. 1 11 o i • ane tie Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, was authorised to assume cnarge ot lyurtlish affairs, in close consultation with the High Commis sioner at t oristantmople, without whose concurrence no important step \\ as o jo taken.

(4) On 1st August, the^ Secretary of State called attention to the Amadia uck en m the following language : “ It seems a question whether “ i' 1 iv* 3 .

P laces 80 remote as Amadia are sufficient to ^ r , a anc T t ^ e las ^s involved.” The Civil Commissioner’s reply /-\ q 1 S( ^ n * v niai ^ au d has not yet been received. « 7 a S reer nent was signed with the Persian Government “ « D f C 01 .• 1 V C e ^ le British Government reiterate in the most *a egonca manner the undertakings which they have repeatedly given3 in the past to respect absolutely the independence and integrity of “ Persia.” This undertaking renders it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to support the proposal for a “ United Kurdistan ” (necessarily including that part of Kurdistan which lies in Persian tenitoi) ) to which political opinion in Mesopotamia at one time inclined (6) On the 22nd August the following telegram was addressed to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad “His Majesty’s Government have had under “ careful consideration question of proposed railway from Kizil Robat “ towards Kifri and Kirkuk. Whatever may be ultimate utility of this line, its immediate construction is recommended on purely strategical “ grounds as essential to retention and pacification of South Kurdistan. “ Apart from financial difficulties, which are exceedingly acute, His Majesty s Government think it necessary before sanctioning extension “ to examine whole question of policy underlying strategical arguments. “ Future of Kurdistan is still unsettled, but/it may be taken as certain “ that permanent responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government in these “ regions will in no event go beyond loose political supervision, and that “ anything in nature of direct British administration is out of question. “ In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are very reluctant “ to take what would in effect be first step towards effective military “ occupation. They have hitherto supported policy of extending British “ influence to South Kurdistan because they believed that inhabitants “ themselves welcomed it. It was on this understanding that they “ sanctioned your proposal to create fringe of autonomous Kurdish “ States under Kurdish Chiefs with British political advisers ; see my “ telegram of 9th May. It would now appear that belief was misplaced, “ and that inhabitants, so far from welcoming British influence, are so “ actively hostile that strategic railways are required to keep them in “ check. In these circumstances might it not be the better course to “ withdraw our political officers, Ac., and leave Kurds to their own “ devices ? Alternative of maintaining order by force among recalcitrant mountain tribesmen opens up prospect of military commitments, “ which His Majesty’s Government contemplate with gravest appre- “ hension. Last thing they desire is to create a new North-'Vest “ Frontier problem on the north-eastern borders of Iraq. Please “ telegraph your views on whole subject.” Political.
