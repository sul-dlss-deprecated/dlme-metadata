[The figures in brackets refer to the Paragraphs or Appendices of the longer “ Memorandum on Persian Railways,' dated the 20th June 1911. Fuller references will be found in the Index, to that Memorandum.'] 1. History. Ihe history of the subject divides itself naturally into three periods : I he first down to 1890, when the Russian Agreement in restriction of railway construction in Persia (the “ Sterilising Agreement ”) took final and definite shape; the second down to 1907, when the Anglo-Russian “ Arrangement regarding Persia ” was arrived at; the third from \907 down to the present time, marking the renewal of discussion as to the lines on which railway development in Persia should proceed. The country, it may be observed, consists, broadly speaking, of a large elevated plateau of an altitude varying from 3,000 to 4,000 feet, and contains extensive tracts of desert where population is sparse or non-existent. The harbours in the Persian Gulf are none of them specially good. First Period (down to 1890). 2. Early Concessions.—The feature of the first period was the race for concessions from the Shah. Of those that were granted, nearly all proved abortive, including the famous “ Reuter Concession ” of 1872, which, besides surrendering into foreign hands the entire industrial resources of the country, conferred upon Baron de Reuter for the space of 70 years an absolute monopoly ot railway construction in Persia (2). One concession, however, that had a practical result was that which led to the construction of ihe small railway, about six miles long, from Tehran to the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim, the only railway that Persia to-day possesses. 3. British Assurances to the Shah of the 24th October 1888.—The race for concessions was marked by acute rivalry between Great Britain and Russia. Russia was believed to be contemplating the construction of railways 11) to the Persian capital; (2) through the province of Khorasan that flanks Afghanistan ; and finally (3) down to the Persian Gulf itself. Great Britain regarded these projects with a jealous eye, and was greatly concerned to defend her interests in the south. The instructions to the British Minister at Tehran (Sir H. Drummond Wolff) were that he could not too strongly impress on the Shah that our only means of giving him effectual support was to improve communication with the Persian Gulf, and in order to counteract the efforts of Russia to obtain control over railways in Persia by means of agree ments with the Shah, Her Majesty’s Government conveyed to the Shah on the 24th October 1888, an assurance to the following effect :— In the event of any Power making 1 an attack without just cause or provocation on Persia, or attempting to take possession of Persian territory against the will of the Persian Govern ment, Her Majesty s Government engage to make earnest representations against such proceedings, and to take such steps as may in their judgment be best calculated to prevent “ any infringement of the integrity of Persia.” The assurance was followed by the opening of the Karuu River to the navigation of all countries, a step from which great things were expected, but the results of which have been disappointing, owing chieflv to the difficulty of maintaining order on the roads communicating with the northern districts (3). S. 79. A /4. The Shah’s autograph undertaking of the 16th September 1888.-~The rivalry between the two European Powers still continued, and in order to protect her interests Great Britain obtained from the Shah in March 1889, an autograph undertaking (ante-dated), of which the following is the text (5) :— “ The Shah to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. “ (Translation). “ His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs. “ Of His Excellency Wolff the English Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary's “ communications, information has been received, and it has caused much astonishment. “ Convey these commands to His Excellency the Minister Plenipotentiary. Even give him “ this verv autograph, in order that he may keep it and be satisfied that our former promise “ with regard to the priority of the English Government over others in the construction of a “ southern railway to Tehran continues to hold good ; and, certainly, whenever railway “ concessions in the north, Ac., are given to others, immediately a concession for a railway “ from Tehran to Shuster, or such a one. will be given to the English Company, and, of “ course, then the clauses and conditions will also be examined, in order that it be to our “ advantage and intei'est, and for the benefit of the commerce of both parties ; and positively no southern railway, without consultation with the English Government, will be granted to “ any foreign Company. “ Dated 16th September 1888. “ p s —^nd it is clear that in Persia nobody will be granted permission to construct railways, except it be solely commercial ones. We say so now that they may know it.” This is the well-known pledge, of which Persia has so often been reminded by the British Government. 5. Policy of Lord Salisbury’s Government.—In the following year an important telegram was addressed by Lord Salisbury to Sir H. D. Wolff on the 19th May 1890 instructing him to offer the most strenuous resistance to a Russian line through Khorasan towards Herat, and if a Russian line were to be made to Tehran, to insist on a concession for a British line in the south. As regards a line from the Caspian to Bunder Abbas, it was remarked that if Her Majesty’s Government were to announce that its con struction would be regarded as an act of hostility towards England, and that they would not undertake, in the case of any future disturbances, to respect the property of the shareholders, or of anyone connected with the line, it would be impossible to raise the necessary capital on any Stock Exchange in Europe (8). 6. The Russian Railway Agreement of 1890.—However, before the year was out, the Shah, on the 11th November, signed an agreement with the Russian Government, of which the first clause ran as follows “ 1. The Persian Government engages for the space of 10 years, beginning from the date “ of signature of this Agreement, neither itself to construct a railway in Persian territory nor “ to permit nor grant a concession for the construction of railways to a Company or other “ persons; and after the expiration of 10 years the renewal of the prolongation shall be “ immediately discussed between the two Parties.” While demurring to the conditions of renewal as tantamount to an abdication of the Shah’s sovereign rights, Her Majesty’s Government accepted the 10 years’ period of “sterilisation ” imposed by this Agreement, and active controversy with the Russian Government for a time was brought to a close (10). 7. A Caspian-Mohammerah Railway and the Quetta-Seistan Railway.—It is of interest at the present time to recall that, in this period of rivalry, a plea for a peaceful solution was strongly urged by Sir H. D. W olff in his scheme for a railway from the Caspian to Mohammerah, to be constructed by an international Company, and based on an understanding between Great Britain, Russia, and the Shah (7). Another scheme that was much discussed was for a Quetta-Seistan Railway, a project to which fuller reference is made below (see para graph 10).Second Period, 1890 1907. 8. Renewal of rumours as to Russian Railway projects.—For some rears after the conclusion of the Russian Railway Agreement of 1890, the “ sterilising ” arrangement continued undisturbed. But with the approach of the date when the 10 years’ period was due to expire, discussion was revived. Great Britain was then involved in South Africa, and Russia herself was uneasy at the grant to Germany of the Bagdad Railway con cession. There were constant rumours of the activity in Persia of Russian engineers, and much anxiety was caused in England by the chauvinistic writings of a M. Rittich, a Russian officer, who had, it was later ascertained, been deputed by his Government in 1900 to make investigations as to Persian railways. Besides indicating possible lines of railway through Afghanistan, this officer strongly pressed for a Russian railway through Tabriz and Tehran to Bunder Abbas or Charbar (14, 15). The Shah was, therefore, reminded by the British Government of the pledge that his pre decessor had given (16), and the question of British policy in Persia was anxiously considered. 9. The “ Strategic Importance ” of Seistan.—The discussion centred in the “strategic importance ” of Seistan, a phrase explained at length in a minute by Lord Curzon (Viceroy), dated the 4th September 1899 (17):— “ Situated at the point of junction of the frontiers of Persia. Afghanistan and Baluchistan, the future of Seistan affects the destinies of all three countries. Lying as it does almost “ midway between Meshed and the Pei'sian Gulf, no advance can he made from FChorasan to “ the sea except through Seistan. Its position upon the exposed flank of Afghanistan would * i render its occupation of great value to any Power contemplating either a move against that “ country or an advance upon Kandahar. Nor will it be denied that the Kandahar-Herat “ line could not be held with safety by India, nor the valley of the Helmand be defended, were “ a hostile Power in possession of Seistan. Furthermore, the grain-producing capabilities of ■“ the district, &amp;c., Ac.” 10. The Quetta-Seistan Railway.—In view of the importance of Seistan, the project of the Quetta-Seistan Railway was once again examined. 'The idea of such a line had been put forward by Colonel Mark Bell, and had been warmly advocated in the years 1888-90 by Sir 11. I). Wolff, who, besides favouring it on commercial grounds, l3elieved that it “ would “ neutralise the commanding position achieved by Russia, by means of the “ Trans-Caspian line, for carrying out her designs in Afghan Turkestan.” In this he differed from Sir H. Braekenbury, the Director of Military Intelli gence, who thought that the construction of the line would be an incentive to Russia to push forward railways south of the Trans-Caspian line into Khorasan, and that it would strengthen the bands of the Russian military party (11, 12). Reviewing the controversy between the two, Lord Curzon pointed out in 1899 that, as had been observed by Lord Salisbury, the object of a Quetta- Seistan Railway would be to prevent Southern Persia from falling into the grasp of Russia. Lord Curzon considered, however, that, for the time being, especially if we could come to an agreement with Russia, it would be better to postpone consideration of the scheme (17). 11. British policy in Persia.—The whole question of British policy in Persia remained under close consideration, and in 1901 the Government of India sent home a further minute by Lord Curzon, dated the 2Sth October 1901, drawing attention to the political objects of Russia in aiming at an outlet on the Persian Gulf (18). In the result His Majesty’s Government formulated their policy in a despatch to the British Minister at Tehran, dated the 6th January 1902, which drew attention to the Shah’s autograph under taking of the 10th September 1888 concerning railways, and, as regards Seistan, declared that in view of “ the interest which this district has for “ Great Britain, on account of its proximity to India, and its position on an “ important trade route between India and Persia,” His Majesty’s Govern ment “ regarded it as of the utmost importance that it should remain free from the intrusion of foreign authority in any shape ” (18). Copy of thedespatch was communicated to the Shah, and in the following year (1903), on the 5th May, Lord Lansdowne declared in the House of Lords that “ we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortilied port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our “ disposal” (19). At a later date it became definitely known that the Russian Railway * The beginning of Russian “ financial tutelage.” /See Memorandum on “Persian Government Loans.' Agreement of 1890 had, as one of the conditions of a large loan to Persian- been renewed, on its expiring in 1900, for a further period of 10 years (20). Third Period (1907 to present time). 12. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 and its influence on British Railway Policy.—With the signature on the 31st August 1907 of the Anglo- Russian ( onvention the discussions as to railways in Persia entered upon a new phase, and a policy of cooperation was substituted for one of rivalry between Great Britain and Russia. As regards the effect of the instrument itself, the Foreign Office pointed out that it would prevent His Majesty’s Government constructing a line as far as i ehran, but that they might construct a line in Southern Persia, if the Russian Government were to construct one in the north. The Russian 'Government had undertaken by the new r arrangement “not to oppose con- “ cessions supported by His Majesty’s Government in the British sphere, nor, without previous discussion with His Majesty’s Government, in the neutral “ zone either ” (21). 13. The Mohammerah-Julfa Railway and communications with the Russian Government.—On the occasion of the King’s visit to Reval in 1908, M. Isvolsky was informed by Sir C. (now Lord) Hardinge that His Majesty’s Government would approve of a railway passing through Persia and ending at Mohammerah on the Persian Gulf (23). In an Aide-memoire of the 15th August 1908 the Russian Government agreed in principle to this line, and, unable themselves to furnish the capital, were ready to settle the financial side of the question with Great Britain. They proposed to join the line with I ehran and, further, to link Tehran with Resht and Enzeli, two places upon the Caspian. The necessity of constructing a line between Askhabad and Meshed (i.e., a line in Khorasan) had also, they observed, to be considered. In order to preserve Russian commercial interests in the north, it would probably be necessary to examine the question of freight rates on the Mohammerah line (24). In a memorandum dated the 9th October 1908, the British Government replied that what they had contemplated was not the actual construction of railways in Persia, but rather the “earmarking’ of concessions. Before railways were constructed, the finances of Persia should be set in order, and His Majesty’s Government themselves -would not be justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest for Persian railways. Besides the southern section of a J ulfa-Mohammerah line, the concessions most closely concerning His Majesty’s Government were for lines from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas via bhiraz to Ailwaz, with the option of a port at Khor Musa. It vvould be w r ell-nigh impossible for Great Britain to assent to anything like a discrimination of tariff rates in favour of Russian goods on the Mohammerah railway. A hope was expressed that the Askhabad-Afeshed project might remain in abeyance (26). 14. Russian Suggestion for a Trans-Persian Railway.—For some time after the British reply to the Russian Aide-memoire, matters remained as they were, but on the 17th December 1909 the Foreign Office forwarded copy of a despatch from Sir A. Nicolson reporting that AI. Isvolsky had mentioned, in connection with the visit, to London of the Duma deputies, their desire that through railway communication with India should be established. ThisS. 79. B 5 would, M. Isvolsky thought, serve as a set-off to any detriment or risks which Russian interests might suffer by the construction of the Bagdad Railway. A copy was also forwarded of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran (Sir G. Barclay), in wdiieh he accepted the list of lines that had been mentioned to the Russian Government as of special importance to British interests, with the addition of a link suggested by Colonel Cox to join Bushire via Aliabad with the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz line (31).

Office' since the practical outcome is described below (see paragraph 21), in the instructions that eventually issued to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg. It is sufficient to remark that, wdiile the India Office emphasised the financial aspect of the matters discussed, the Foreign Office laid stress on the desirability of not ruling out altogether consideration of the linking of Russian and Indian railway systems, and on the fact that, whatever we may do in the south, Russia was unlikely to defer railuray construction in the north of Persia. 15. The attitude of Germany.— While the correspondence was passing a new element was introduced by the action of a third Power, Germany. Among the conditions on which Great Britain and Russia had proposed in a Note dated the 16th February 1910, to make a joint advance to Persia of 400.000L, was one in the following terms : — “ 4. La Perse s’engage a ne donner aucune concession pour la construction de chemins de for en Perse avant d’en offrir Poption aux Gouvernements de Grande-Bretagne et de Russia. L e droit d option ne sera pas exerce dans le cas oil il s’agirait d une concession a accorder a “ un subjet persan dans le but de construire et d’exploiter une ligne de chemin de fer avec des eapitaux exclusivement persans, pourvu qu il soit prouve a la satisfaction des Gouveme- ments de Grande-Bretagne et de Russie que ces capitaux sont reellement indigenes.” d ht' condition aroused the apprehensions of the German Government, which declared in a memorandum to the Russian Government that the reserve Germany had hitherto shown in Persian matters “ ne saurait aller jusqu a empecher toute tentative des milieux commercAaux et financiers “ allemands de chercher en Perse un terrain d’activite.” The German Ambassador made representations also to Sir E. Grev on the same lines, and from this time onward the question of Persian railways becomes closely connected with that of the Bagdad Railway, and, therefore, also with German interests (34). In the same year (1910), Great Britain and Russia warned Persia in a joint Note dated the 7th April against giving to the subjects of other Foreign Powers “ des concessions qui puis sent porter atteinte d leurs interets politiques “ ou strategiques en Perse f and, in reply to a request for an explanation of the word “ concessions f they declared in another Note, dated the 20th May 1910, that les deux Puissances s atteyident a ce qu avant de delivrer des “ concessions quelconques de votes de communication, de telegy'aphes et de ports “ d un sujet etranger, le Gouvernement persan entre dans un echangc de vues “ avec dies a fin qua les interets politiques ou strategiques des deux Puissances “ puis sent etre diiment sauvegardesP A reply made by the Persian Govern ment to tins Note against the wushes of the two Powers was returned to the Persian Government on the 4th September 1910 (35). 16. Russo-German negotiations regarding the linking of Tehran with the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c.—At this point mention may conveniently be made of the negotiations between Germany and Russia, initiated at Potsdam towards the end of 1910. Briefly, the proposals were (1) that the Bagdad Railway should not be opposed by Russia ; (2) that Russia should link Tehran via Khanikin with the Bagdad Railway ; (3) that Germany should not build lines between the Bagdad Railway and the Persian frontier north of Khanikin, and (4) that Germany should recognise Russia’s special interests in the north of Persia’. These negotiations were interrupted by the illness of M. Sazonow, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and have not yet been concluded (40, 62).6 His Majesty’s Government have urged the Russian Government not to part with all control over the Khanikin-Tehran line, and some apprehension has been expressed by Sir E. Grey lest this line might be used by the Turks for aggressive purposes (02). 17. Russian Consortium’s Scheme for a Trans-Persian Railway.—To return to the Trans-Persian Railway. In August of 1910 the plans of a Russian “consortium” or syndicate, were communicated to the Foreign Office for such a railway by way of Rostoff (on the Don, near the sea of Azov), Baku, Tehran, and Nuskhi (the terminus of the Indian Quetta-Nushki Railway). The length of the journey from London to Bombay was taken as 5,156 miles, and the time to be occupied as varying from seven days to eight days six hours, according to speed. Sixty thousand first-class passengers were reckoned on, and 20,000 second-class, the single journey fares from London to Bombay being 41/. 6s. and 24/. 12s., respectively. Daily, instead of weekly, mails were contemplated. The cost of construction was estimated at about 13,500/. per mile, or 21,850,000/. in all. A net revenue of about 1,250,000/. was expected, sufficient to pay four per cent, on “ an ordinary capital of 23,300,000/. realised at 85,” and 15 per cent, on “ subscribed capital ” amounting to about 2,100,000/. The enterprise was to be Anglo- Franco-Russian (38). At a later date some further particulars were supplied, from which it appeared that a branch to Charbar or some other port on the coast was contemplated (38), and that the cost of building the line might be 18,700.000/. or even so little as 15,000,000/., and the annual net revenue about 709 000/ (49). 18. Attitude of the Russian Government towards the Scheme.-—The attitude of the Russian Government, as officially communicated to the group putting forward the scheme, is that it must “ conform itself to the economical interests of the Empire and not he prejudicial to the interests of the Exchequer ” (47). It was explained to Sir E. Grey by the Russian Ambassador that the profit on the transit over Russian railways of goods for the Trans-Persian Railway, calculated at about 475,000/. a year, might be allocated to the new line (47). 19. View of the Board of Trade.—When consulted as to the scheme, the Board of Trade pronounced it to be “of a very speculative character, and put forward mainly in Russian interests,” but they thought that His Majesty’s Government might adopt an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards it, if (1) a line were constructed from Kerman to the Persian Gulf in which British influence should predominate, and (2) “ equal facilities for all through out the whole railway ” were granted. 20. View of the Indian Inter-Departmental Committee.—In India the opinions of various officers were collected, and an Inter-Departmental Committee was appointed to consider the scheme. In their report they observed that “ any material improvement ol land communications towards “ or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of “ India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India,” but they recognised that it might be desirable to seize the opportunity now of securing certain essential conditions in connection with a Trans-Persian Railway. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, they agreed generally with the Board of Trade. They did not, moreover, think that the gross earnings of the line would be more than one-fifth of the figure assumed in the Consortium’s estimate, and they believed that the cost of construction would be at least 50 per cent, higher than that originally allowed for (i.e., 21,850,000/.). The Committee further decided against an alignment through Yezd, Seistan, and Nushki on account of (1) its apprehended effect upon the mind of the Amir and his advisers (2) con siderations based on the “ strategic importance of Seistan ” ; and (3) its inaccessibility to British naval power in the Persian Gulf. Instead, they * Connection through Afghanistan, it may here be explained- would be the shortest and easiest way of linking Russian and Indian railways. But this is excluded from practical politics by the attitude of the Amir and his advisers.recommended an alignment by way of Yezd, Bunder Abbas, and Karachi, and tlie\ thought that the Consortium s proposals might be accepted on certain teims and conditions, which ultimately were adopted substantially bv His Majesty’s Government (45). 21. Decision of His Majesty’s Government—On the 10th May 1911 a despatch was addressed to Sir G. Buchanan instructing him that His Majesty’s Government were ready to assent in principle to a Trans-Persian Railway, and to agree to the initiation of negotiations between its promoters in this country and in Russia subject to the following conditions (50):— “ 1. The line shall enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas instead of at Kerman, subject “ to reconsideration as the result of actual survey, and shall in any case join the Indian “ railway system at Karachi and not at Nushki. “ 2. There shall be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas, or wherever the line enters the “ British sphere of influence in Persia. “ In return for the co-operation of Great Britain in the project, which examination has “ shown to be likely to benefit Russia far more than Great Britain or India, Russia shall pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Afghan frontier within “ the Russian or neutral sphere in Persia. “ 4. Russia shall support demands made by Great Britain of the Persian Government for “ concessions of the following branch lines connected with the proposed Trans-Persian “ Railway “ ( a ) Prom Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with a branch to port to be constructed at “ Khor Musa. “ (b) From Bunder Abbas or Charbar, via Regan and Bam, to Kerman. “ (c) Prom Bushire, via Aliabad, to some point on a line— “ (d) Prom Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz. “ 5. The main line and those of the above branches w'hich lie in the neutral sphere— i.e., (a), (c), and (d) —shall be internationalised ; but the branch which lies entirely in the British sphere— i.e. (b) —shall be a purely British project. “ 6. Absolute equality of treatment in all respects shall be guaranteed to British and “ British-Indian trade passing over the line and its branches.” Sir G. Buchanan was authorised to explain frankly that the first three of these conditions were dictated by strategic considerations, and had been inserted in the interests of India ; also to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government expressed no opinion as to the commercial or financial aspects of the question (50). 22. Railways of special interest to Great Britain.—A short account may be useful of the branch lines referred to in condition (4) above. (a) Mohavimerah-Khorcmabad, ivith a port at Khor Musa. 0 —There has been a consensus of opinions as to the advantages of a railway in this part of Persia, where we have a useful ally in the Sheikh of Mohanimerah, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are already carrying out extensive operations. The opinions include those of Sir G. Barclay (27, 42), Mr. C. Green way, Managing Director of the Oil Company (43), the Government of India (46), and Lord Curzon (Appendix IX.) In March last communications passed with the Russian Government, with the result that Russia agreed to the British Government applying for an option for the construction of the railway, provided that work was proceeded with only after a friendly exchange of views between the two Governments (52, App. vii.). The Persian Government on being addressed (53, App. viii.), returned an ambiguous reply (54), but Sir G. Barclay was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Government would be prepared to consider proposals from a British group for general railway construction (54, 55), and negotiations are now proceeding on the basis of His Majesty’s Government (as distinct from private parties) standing entirely aside (56). A survey of the country through which a Mohammerah-Khoremabad line woidd pass has recently been carried out by Lieutenant Wilson (60). (h) Bunder Abbas (or Charbar) to Kerman .—This also has been recognised as a useful commercial line (30, 36), and in 1909 a group supported by the * Khor Musa is a small inlet from the Persian Gulf at the east of the Shatt-el-Arab.Indo-European Telegraph Company, proposed to construct it (29). Politi cally its importance is not so great, since it would lie in the zone already under British influence. ic) Bushire via Aliabad, connecting with a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz line.—The difficulty here lies in the mountainous nature of the country between Bushire and Shiraz, and the Government of India were opposed to a railway between the two places (40). Correspondence has recently been proceeding as to the possibility of using motor transport by the hiruzabad route, as suggested by Mr. Chick, Commercial Adviser at Bushire (61). [d) Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. —Apart from any commercial advantages it may possess (30), this line, or a concession for it, would be useful as blocking in the neutral sphere of Persia the advance of any line from Bagdad (36). 23. The Persian Railway Syndicate. — A proposal that has recently been put forward by “ The Persian Railway Syndicate,” a group representing the Oil Company and others, affords some hope that of the lines mentioned (a), (b), and (d) may eventually be constructed, in the order named, under British auspices. r lhe financial side of the (question may be simplified thiough the recent engagement by Persia of American financial advisers, and the employ ment of Swedish officers for the gendarmerie should help in restoring order where railways have to pass.
