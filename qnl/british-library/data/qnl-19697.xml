C .S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department' I have the honour to submit for the consideration of the Government of India, and such action as may be deemed expedient, a copy of a Note by my Commercial Advisor, Mr. H. G. Chick, on the subject of openings for Bankincr business in the Persian Gulf Ports. 2. It may be within the recollection of the Government of India that the Imperial Bank of Persia have, in the past, considered the question of opening branches at Maskat and Bahrain, and the National Bank of India at MaskaL Vide correspondence connected with Foreign As regards the Imperial Bank, it would Octobe'^.' 61 ^''' No - 3&lt;i47 ' E ' B ' ' lat&lt;!d 27th seeal that , the ter ™s of its Charter preclude Resident's telegram, in reply, dated 1st Novem- the location of branches at Maskat Or berl904 ' Bahrain ; while the National Bank appar ently did not find the prospects at Maskat sufficiently attractive. In the result neither project took shape. 3. The disability attached to the Imperial Bank in connection with their Charter presumably still exists, as do the considerations which make their entry inro business relations with Bahrain not entirely free from political objection, but perhaps the Foreign Department will see their way to suggest informally to the National Bank of India or other important Bank doing business in Bombay, that they m'ght find it worth while to examine the present position as regards openings for Banking business in the Gulf Ports, especially Bahrain and Kuwait, and (if possible) to depute a representative to the Gulf for that purpose. Note on Banking in the Persian Gulf Ports by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Advisor to His Majesty's Resident and Consul-General. In all the Gulf Ports there are at present European Banks at Bushire Mohammerah and Basrah only. The following figures show the latest returns of import and export trade at those larger ports which are at present without a Bank:— Imports. Exports. £ £ Kuwait ... ... ... 294,369 109,690 Bahrain ... ... ... 1,394^9^9 ... 1 ,169,471 Lingah ... ... 116,502 118,913 Bandar Abbas ... 436,981 ... 205,035 Maskat ## * - 553,724 277,580 N,B. Imports to Bahrain included ^420,000 pearls and ^'716,^^4 specie: exports ^732,666 pearls and ^170,596 specie. Maskat imports included ^ I0 3' 0 ^ 2 arms an( ^ £} 12,400 specie: exports ^9^)733 specie. Kuwait exports included ^'64,19: specie. The importance of trade, apart from the pearl industry, in Bahrain, and in Bandar Abbas would certainly seem to offer possibilities for a well-connected Bank. The position of Kuwait is perhaps still more important to us. It is I think, undeniable that the first Bank to establish itself in these parts always acquires a predominant position as against future comers : and would it, or would it not, be useful to have an English Bank established in Kuwait, with a possible monopoly from the Shaikh, before any change takes place in the status of Kuwait ?2 As regards the Imperial Bank of Persia and business along the Gulf shores, it may be noted that the Bank has so far been a ' Persian Bank only, with its chief office in the Persian Capital, and its currency basis is the Persian Kran : while on the other hand the currency basis of Bahrain, Kuwait, Maskat and Lingah is for all practical business purposes the rupee: in Bandar Abbas also, as in Bushire, rupees are in current use as coin, and in business transactions on account of extensive trade relations with India, The bulk of the trade of Bahrain and Kuwait is with India, not Persia. There might conceivably, in the eyes of Government, be a good deal to say politically against the idea of the Bank of_ ' Persia' becoming the Bank of Bahrain as well, even if they were to work in Bahrain on a rupee basis: and for this reason an Indian Bank, such as the Chartered Bank of India,^ etc., or the National Bank might be better qualified. From a commercial point of view an Indian Bank in any of the ports mentioned would, I think, be better suited to business conditions, and more welcome. The prospect of the Imperial Bank of Persia becoming the sole banking medium in all Gulf Ports would not be altogether pleasant: as far as rupee business is concerned, in Bushire, for instance, their rates are always much in advance of Bazar rates, their terms of business are generally stiff, and the growing popularity of the British Post Office as a means of transmitting rupees to India may be considered, to a large extent, as evidence of this. I think there is sufficient reason to infer that, in several of the ports named, a European Bank could very profitably start a branch at the present time, and that there will soon be a move in that direction: therefore the question whether an Indian Bank or the Imperial Bank of Persia would be preferred by Govern ment is of some Interest.

Please refer to your demi-offioial of the 27th. * * &lt; Since 1900 the position at Bahrein has been altered considerably by the establishment of two or three European firms. In the case of Koweit, the Sheikh if approached by either the Political Agent or myself, would probably scent something official p^nd reply that he saw no need for a bank. It would seem to me, therefore, that the best course to pur sue, at either place, would be for a tactful representative to make a personal visit, with a view to finding out the business possibilities and making friends with the Sheikhs. In this connection I may mention that the Agent of the Im perial Bank at Mohammerah recently said he was sanguine of doing good business with Sheikh, if his directors, whom he contemplates approaching on the subject, signify their con sent ./}vi h ^ —r ox*, '-^f /$ 7^y^&gt;t^4c y^oV^' ^vJl^c C-tJ Oy/ Cs^Aa~^&lt; #CL I vg p i ^ ^ CUSSe ^ matter with the representatives of the National and the Chartered .ban ks at Bombay, and at Karachi and with merchants in both towns. The publication of the new Consular report on the trade of Bandar Abbas—containing a renewed assertion of the need tor a bank—enabled me to do so apropos des bottes. I have not been satisfied with a mere s atement of opinion by the bankers, but have discussed with them and with European and native merchants the details of the divorse trade operations known in the Gulf. My ; object m doing so was to see whether at any point in these operations there was a step that ; was likely to afford an opening for a bank. All the evidence is unfavourable. There are, I believe, agencies of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Bushire and Basrah. ere is none at Bandar Abbas ; and at Bander Abbas a considerable trade is done by Indian mere ants. e goods shipped to Bandar Abbas are mainly for Shiraz, Ispahan and oth«;r p aces m t e interior. These goods are often sold for delivery at the said upcountry places, - e nsv in trajisit being on th 3 seller. The ultimate payments for them are often encashed l upcountry. There are, I understand, no European merchants in Bandar Abbas, It will not, I think, be desired that I should give a detailed account of the several kinds of trade operations to be financed. The main point is that the trade is really done on * credit by middle men who pay cash to the importing firm and sell the goods to traders 1 a ra es esigne to co\er interest and risk. In fact these trad3r8 discharge the functions 0 S uaran ee broker and a good deal more, The credit given by them or their principals is o en ar g®i n P^Por^on to the standing of the dealer who receives it. The risk is considerable : t 11 / 701 !*' e - P^ 0 ^ 11 * 31 ^ 6 t 0 an y Person who knew the standing and position of the individual dealer less intimately than the native middle man knows them. A European would not possess e requisite knowledge. For this reason no Western bank would give delivery of goo s on ere it. t would want cash down ; and this ready cash would have to be paid by the native middle man He would want his profit or commission as at present. Therefore the m en en ion 0 ^ e ank would have for its most obvious effect the addition of the bank's com mission o ie c arges now incurred. Trade would not pay an additional commission : therefore this section of the banking business would go past the bank. ' . ^P 01 ^® int 0 Bandar Abbas, and other Persian ports are largely done by native firms and , tradoi • in Shikarpur and Karachi. Piecegoods are bought on speculation by, say, a Shikarpiiri [ mere lan—om an imp orting house in Karachi. T he goods are shipped direct from England | to Bandar Abbas and the documents representing them are posted from England to the import- ing house m Karachi. The Shikarpun pays cash, and the documents are then sent to a repre- sen ative or consignee, named by him, at Bandar Abbas. The nominee takes delivery ot the goo s an ^ ls tri utes them. When he receives the value of the goods and desires to remit it ; to Ins principal m India, he buys hundis in the bazaar. These hundis are drawn on a merchant or a shroff in Bombay or Karachi m respect of goods exported from Persia. It must be borne in mind that most oi the hundis are drawn and sold, not at Bandar Abbas itself, but in the greatly more important trade centres in the interior. It sometimes happens that there are not enough huridis in the Bandar Abbas bazaar ; and in that case specie is sent up from Bandar Abbas to I those inland centres and given m exchange for hundis. On other occasions when exchange | is favourable or there is likely to be a glut of hundis in the ports, Indians go up the Gulf taking rupees with them and buy the hundis. They are said to charge about 2 per cent, commission from which the cost of the operation is to be deducted. When there are not enough hundis, either in the ports or m the interior, to meet the value of imports, an inducement arises to export goods and the balance is thus maintained. _ It must always be borne m mind That paarTs and opium have high specific value, and are eminently suitable for settling a trade balance. On account of these commodities considerable sums are often due in London. Native firms can draw against these credits and sell their draits ; and the money can, by arrangement, be made payable in London or India. The intricacy and mobility of exchange are such that we cannot expect the incomings and the outgoings of any one port or group of ports to balance. From what I have said it will be clear not only that the distribution of this trade is and must, for the present, remain in the hands of natives, but also that there has grown up under See what Mr. Chick says about the rates of s i m ^ar control a fairly complete and efficient the Imperial Bank of Persia, organization for financing the business. It does F. N. P. no ^ a pp e ar that a bank could work more cheaply . than this organization does. Therefore a bank, if established now m, say, Bandar Abbas, would see most of this part of the business^ also flow past its doors m ths old channels. It would get only the leavings, and these leavings would not keep it going. Ev3n the financing of the pearl trade is largely done by buyers who take large sums m Indian silver up the Gulf. There is no evidence, so far as I can find, that a bank would be able to do this more cheaply and yet clear a profit. I believe that shipment of specie from theGulf to India are rare. It would be interesting to know what comes of all the rupees that go into Persia. 1The bankers are unanimously of opinion that there is at present no room for a bank in the Gulf ports ; and they give very much the reasons I have set out above. Three out of the four at once said that the strongest evidence in support of their view is that the Imperial Bank of Persia, knowing all about the business does not go to Bandar Abbas. They maintain that under present conditions or under any such conditions as now seem possible, they would not recom mend even a fresh survey of the ground ; and it appears that the matter has been considered bv them more than once' in recent years. They say that if there appeared any likelihood of a bank's paying, one or more of them would open in the Gulf at once. They contend, further that if a German bank went there under present conditions, it would be welcome to do so, and would only burn its fingers. And one of them stated the view that if a German bank went there and did well a good bank situated in India would be able to follow it and catch it up. They sav that under present conditions they would not be disposed to recommend their head oftcea to co-operate in a study of the ground or in creating a j oint establishment to work for them all. They are aware of no precedent for such a course. Although they have never heard it mooted they do not contend that there is anything impracticabh in the project. They have promised to study it further. That, however, is for the possibly remote future. Finally they sav that being first in the field does not always count for so much as Mr. Chick believes. And fW are auite right. Being first in the field is advantageous only at the psychological moment. Pioneering is notoriously risky unless the time is well chosen. They hold that the present is not the right tim?, and that a British and a German bank would not be reciprocally exclusive. None of the bankers alluded to the question of a possible subsidy ; and, naturally, I did not. 31-10-11 • F - N ° el Paton - Department of Commerce and Industry. J), ^ AJrlrkj * ?i2t ,' COMVIENTS in connection with Mr,Noel-Paton' s NOTE the propose! establishment of banking institutions at certain. Ports in the Persian Gulf. I As regards the second paragraph,the Iinperial Bank of Persia have a branch at Mo hammer ah, not at Basra (where they desire to open at the earliest opportunity,but are hamper- — ed by an agreement with the Imperial Ottoman. Bank of whic^ they are seeking to get rid). Further,goods shipped to Bunder Abbas are mainly for Kermaa, v ezd etc,and not for Shiraz,Isfahan,etc(which follow the Bushire route chiefly) BAHREIN. It is very satisfactory to have had the matter bro -ached officially to Karachi firms : it will at least have had the effect of making renewed pressure later on much easier,and clears the way for the Imperial Bank of Persia, But_the Note deals almost entirely with the system of trad*, and prospects at Bunder Abbas (with which Karachi is more concerned than is the case in other Gulf ports);and for several reasons the desirability of early banking enter prise at Bahrein#',which has by reason of tKs. greater trad*- far greater possibilities of success,might be advisedly kept under discussion by Government, The coming institutdii)^ of wireless telegraphic communication,as also the advent 0 f several European houses to Bahrein for the purchase cf pearls,seem to me to provide favourable opportunities for keeping the project alive, Mr,Noe 1 -Paton remarks that *' even the financing df the pearl trade is largely done by buyers,who take ' lareee sums in Indian silver up the Gulf 'Sand he opines ' that there is no evidence that a bank would be able to ' do this more cheaply and yet clear a profit,' The reason why buyers have to do this must be because there is no banking institution in Bahrein tosupply rupees against drafts or bills of exchange : for the R.I,Steam Navigation Co. charge -§■% freight on sum® of rupees ca:i j riel, and surely this would be avoided if there were a bank; in Bahrein with branches elsewhere,doing rupee business. The sea-transport would be much less,at any rati The amount of rupees imported,passing the Bahrein Customs in 1909-10,was no less than £ 716.794,one-third less in 1910-11, Despite opinions of Karachi and Bombay banks, successive managers of the Imperial Bank of Persia here , for ^ome five years to my knowledgebase been strongly in favour of trying to extend their business to Bahrein , are working at it even now,and in one case have wished to visit the islands to gauge prospects ; but here they are hampeee^ by their Persian charter,have in former years been averse to opening Rupee accounts in their books,and the Board has also hitherto hesitated to open where telegraphic communication is not provided. Two of these objections^ from what I am told,have lost weight : for their Mohajnineral^ branch has been a success, and there rupee and Turkish coinage transactions are said to exist side by side with Kran business,while telegraphic facilities are almost nil. Besides ^Bahrein ought soon to have its wireless install- -ation. We have always favoured the idea of an Indian Bank ,in preference to the Imperial Bank,at Bahrein ,- though on this point the Government of India have not expressed themselves,as was suggested in my previous note—^ but I have little dcbubt that,if they would authorize the Resident to discuss with the Imperial Bank prospects at Bahrein,give them information and assure him of Government support m the event of the project being taken up,the Imperial Bank wo rld not hold back for long. I know it would coincide with the ideas of their two Managers at present in the Gulf. Will Government authorize that step to be taken ?■—Telegram. X. From Cox, Basrah. To Foreign, Simla. no. 3700. Dated 26th July, 1916. Eastern Bank Basrah under instructions from their directors have applied for permission to open branch of their Bank at Bahrain forthwith and enquire what arrangements would be made by Government and what assistance could be 'given them by Government should they do so. On political and commercial grounds I am strongly of opinion that we should encourage the bank to open at Bahrein at once, and that we undertake to give them the custody of such Government monies as there are there and,in addition undertake (1) to obtain the Shaikh's consent to their establishment (2) to give them facilities for shipping rupees free of freight by Government vessels (subject to any fee loviabls by Captain of ship under Naval or Marine regulations) when tiiis can be done without additional expense to the State. This latter pro vision necessarily conflicts with the petty financial interests of the B .I.S.N. Co. who consider it to their interest to get as much as they can out of freight on specie from Bahrain, but I air very strongly of opinion that we should do all in our power to make the Bank^f independent in this matter oi the B.I.o.N.
