Agreement between the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Secretary of State for War (acting also for the Minister of Pensions, for the final settlement of Charges arising out of the Great War and of certain other Expenditure. PREAMBLE The documents known as “ Memorandum A ” and “ Memorandum B,” which were agreed^ upon by the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Army Council in 1915 and 1918 respectively, regulated the adjustment between Imperial and Indian revenues, in accordance with the Resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament on 16th September and 26th November 1914, of— (a) effective expenditure in connection with— (i) the Indian Expeditionary Forces ; (ii) the British troops withdrawn from India for service in the war otherwise than with the Indian Expeditionary Forces ; and (iii) the Territorial and Garrison units sent to India in replacement of the withdrawn troops : (b) the payments to be made by India during the war in respect of— (i) Capitation Rate ; (ii) Deferred Pay and Gratuities ; and (iii) Sea Transport. 2. In correspondence ending with War Office letter No. 0164/5465 (F. 1) of 15th March 1923 it was agreed that, in consideration of the payment of a lump sum, certain expenditure disbursed, or to be disbursed, by the India Office which, under the terms of the above Memoranda, was, or would be, properly an Imperial charge, should be borne by Indian revenues. 3. There remained, however, certain effective and non-effective claims (the most important of which are enumerated in Tables I and II of the Appendix to this Preamble—see page 30), arising out of or associated with the Great War, which had been preferred by the Imperial Departments and by the India Office, respectively, but were either rejected or not accepted in full by the other side, and certain proposed non-effective adjustments between the Departments which have not been in dispute and which are enumerated in Table III of that Appendix. 4. A settlement of these matters has now been arrived at, the general terms of which, as jointly submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War (actino- also for the Minister of Pensions) and the Secretary of State for India, and approved by the Cabinet 29th April 1931, are as follows:— (1) That, without prejudice to any question of principle involved, these claims and adjustments shall, without further payment by either side to the other, be regarded as settled.Preamble, cont .— 4 (2) That the payments made by India to the War Office for Sea Transport and Home Effective Charges in respect of the periods 1st April 1 p 111° '’^st Maic i 1925, and 31st March 1926, respectively, shall stand as final. An advance ol £334,000 originally made by the India Office m respect of Sea transport, but not hitherto brought to account by the War Office, shall remain in^ the hands of the latter. ^ (3) That all minor War Claims already raised shall, similarly, be regarded as covered by this Settlement. (4) That no further claims arising out of the war shall be preferred on either side. 5. In arriving at this Settlement it was contemplated, with refei-ence to it and o the other arrangements made in connection with the war, that the broad lines o division as between the two Governments of non-effective expenditure would be as follows: — (a) To be borne by India :— (i) Casualty pensions due to the Great W ar granted to personnel of the Indian Army and their dependants. (ii) Other non-effective awards to personnel of the Indian Army and their dependants made during the period 1st April 1914 to 31st March 191J. (iii) The share of ordinary non-effective charges in respect of personnel of the Jjjtphy.u. Army and their dependants attributable to seivice m the period 4th August 1914 to 31st May 1919. (b) To be borne by the Imperial Government: By the Ministry of Pensions :— Casualty pensions due to the Great War granted to personnel of the Butish Army and their dependants. By the War 0JJiee :— (i) Non-effective awards (other than Great War casualty pensions) granted to personnel of the British Army and their dependants during the period 1st April 1914 to 31st March 1919. (ii) The share of ordinary non-effective charges in respect of personnel of the British Army and their dependants attributable to service in the period 4th August 1914 to 31st March 1920. The Agreement below has been made to set forth in detail these non-effective adjustments, together with certain effective adjustments arising out of the Settlement, and opportunity has been taken to provide also for the settlement of certain other questions which, though not arising immediately out of the war, have come under discussion iu connection with the war adjustments or been affected by those adjustments.Sec.

Great War Casualty Awards— cont. iG) that in addition to any charge the Government of India may have to bear under subsection (1) (c) of this section, for a share of a Special Campaign Pension, that Government shall be liable for a share of any other award of non-effective pay, except a Great War casualty award, made^fe or after 1st April 1920, to or in respect of a British Army soldier who was re-enlisted after having received a Great War casualty award (or who subsequent to re-enlistment received a Great V\ ar casualty aw r ard with effect from a date prior to the date of re-enlistment), but who prior to the- date of re-enlistment had not been awarded a service element of pension. In such a case the charge to be borne by the Government of India shall be limited to that portion of the pension which under the usual rules will be attributable to service on the Indian Establishment after the date of re-enlistment. (Charges arising from Special Campaign Pensions under the provisions of subsection (1) (c) of this section are not subject to this limitation). The Imperial Government shall similarly be liable for a share attributable to service on the Imperial Establishment in the corresponding cases of officers or warrant officers of Indian Army Departments. Coi responding rules shall apply in the case of officers re-commissioned after having received Great War casualty awards. VHI. (1) In the case of an officer or other rank granted a casualty award, after retirement or discharge as the result of two distinct disabilities, one due to service in the war period and the other due to post-war service, no claim shall be preferred by either Government against the other in respect of that portion of the non-effective pay granted on retirement which is equal to the appropriate rate of retired pay or pension that would have been admissible if the individual had been invalided at the same date solely in consequence of the disability due to service in the war period. In such a case and in the case of an officer or other rank whose death was due to two distinct disabilities, as above, but who had not been granted a casualty award as the result of such disabilities, no claim shall be preferred by either Government against the other in respect of any non-effective pay that may be granted to the family. (2) Cases in which officers and other ranks of the British Army who, although certified by the W ai Office medical authorities as suffering from disabilities due to service in the w T ar period, are granted compensation for such disabilities by the War Office under post-war rules on the ground that the medical authorities of the Ministry of Pensions are unable to certify that there is any existing disability due to service in the war period, shall be dealt with as though the disabilities were due to post-war service. JX. Xo claim shall be pieferiedby either Government against the other in respect of— (1) Great War casualty awards granted to civil personnel; (2) half pa\ gianted to officers or warrant officers on account of unfitness due to service in the war period. In the case of officers or warrant officers placed on half pay for medical unfitness resulting from disability or disabilities due partly to service in the war period and partly to service outside that period, the half pay shall be dealt with as though the disability or disabilities were due wholly to service in the war period and no claim in respect of the half pay shall be made by either Government against the other. But if the disability due to service in the war period is regarded as having ceased after a certain date and the officer remains on half pay thereafter on account of another disability not due to service in the war period, a claim shall lie in respect of the half pay issued after the date in question. The question whether the unfitness v T as due to service in the war period shall be determined in accordance with the working rules shown in the Appendix attached to this Agreement.PART 3— aont. —Sec.

The Army Xon-Efl'ective Accounts presented annually by each Government to the other shall be supported by certificates to the effect that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the certifying authority, no charge that is inadmissible under the rules in sy^tions VII, VIII, or IX (2) has been included in the accounts ; but this arrangement i *11 be without prejudice to the right of each Government to have any necessary adjustments made in later accounts should it be found that any accounts did, in fact, include charges inadmissible under the sections mentioned, provided that, when the original accounts were presented, the information necessary to detect the errors was not in the possession of the Government claiming the adjustments XI. When medical treatment in respect of disabilities due to service in the Avar period is provided or authorised by and at the expense of one Government on behalf of retired officers or discharged soldiers of the other Government, the latter shall, if so desired, refund to the former the expenses so incurred. XII. No claim shall be preferred against the Imperial Government in respect of Great War casualty awards granted by the Government of India to European or Indian personnel employed on vessels on Imperial charter or on vessels engaged by the Government of India for service in connection with the Great War. XIII. —(1) No claim shall be preferred against the Imperial Government in respect of Great War casualty awards granted to or in respect of personnel of the Royal Indian ^Marine. (2) No further claim shall be preferred against the Imperial Government in respect of Great War casualty awards granted by the Government of India to or in respect of naval ratings in consequence of service in the war period with the Royal Indian Marine. Any such cases now in the administration of the Government of India shall continue to be so administered during the currency of the existing pensions or allowances, whether issued at the present or some altered rate. But if an existing Great War casualty award granted to or in respect of a naval rating in consequence of service in the war period with the Royal Indian Marine ceases from any cause the question of its renewal and subsequent payment shall be a matter for the Imperial Government, who shall also deal with claims by any such ratings who are not in receipt of Great War casualty aAvards at the date of this Agreement, or by their representatives, to first grants of Great War casualty awards. In neither case shall any charge be made against the Government of India in respect of any award that may be made. XIV. -(1) The following rules shall apply to the administration of Great War casualty aAA r ards and to the incidence of cost of such awards granted to or in respect of— (a) retired officers and retired warrant officers of the Indian Army disabled or dying as the result of service in the war period while the said officers and warrant officers were re-employed by the War Office; (b) officers or warrant officers (regular or temporary) of the British Army who had previously belonged to the Indian Army, or of the Indian Army who had previously belonged to the British Army, and in whose case disablement or death resulted from disabilities due to service in the war period, whether in the British Army or the Indian Army, or in each of the two Armies ; (c) personnel of the South Persia Rifles ; (d) personnel of the Anglo-Indian Battery, R.F.A., Anglo-Indian Force, Cossipore Artillery, Calcutta Volunteer Battery, North-Western Railway Machine Gun Section, Indian Volunteer Artillery, Madras Guards Inland Water Transport, Madras Guards, Indian Defence Force, or of any other unit specially raised or specially reorganised in India at the request of the War Office for service in the Great War ; (e) personnel engaged by, and in the employment of, the Government of India who were under the Admiralty or Board of Trade schemes for war risks.

On the termination of the effects of such aggravation, administration of the case shall be taken over by the former Government, who shall be liable for the whole cost of the pension as from the date from which the transfer has effect.

The Sheikh Othman- £l Khudad section of the Aden Railway was built during the war at a cost of Rs.5,01,333. This expenditure was borne equally by H.M.G. and G.of I. The railway has now been dismantled and sold. The net proceeds of the sale, less the cost of dismantlement, being Rs.305 only. The rolling stock and stores of the Aden Railway have also been disposed of at a loss, the amounts being given on page 3 of the G.of 1 1 s letter below. G. of I. have allocated these losses between the commercial section (for which G.of I. were wholly responsible) and the strategic section (to which the present letter relates). For the latter section the loss on the sale of rolling stock and the depreciation on stores is calculated by the G.of I. to amount to Rs.2,76,140. The net total loss attributable to the Sheikh Othman el Khudad section of the•Railway thus comes to Rs.2,75,835 and the G.of I. consider that H.M.G. should bear half this amount. Since the railway was built for strategic purposes the G.of I. appear to be justified in this view and it is proposed to support it as in the attached draft letter to the Air Ministry. r-r~ — 288 -! 935 - Financial Secretary, I should he grateful for your observations on this proposal of the GoverniLent of India’s, subject to them it seems to me orima facie one which is very difficult to defend and I cannot believe that we should find it at all easy to secure any contribution from the imperial Government to the loss which has been/ 2956 6000 7/34a been incurred by the Government of India us the result of their dismantling and removing the Aden Railway. In the first place, the .'settlement of War claims seeds to be directly relevant, secondly, the fact that the Imperial Departments claimed (as they were entitled to) a share in any proceeds which might result from the disposal of the assets of the Railway does not, I think: justify the Government of India in putting forward a counter-claim such as that embodied in their present letter. The pressure for the dismantling and removal of this Railway has come entirely from India* At one stage the sultan of Lahej was prepared to take over and run at his own expense a certain section of it so long as it was left in situ ,and there have been other independent offers. To come forward at this stage with a statement that the net proceeds of the sale less the cost of dismantlement are only Rs.3Q5 and that a loss of some £2^000 has been incurred on the transaction, and invite H.M.G. to bear half of this loss (incurred entirely as the result of transactions as to the detail of which they were not consulted or informed) seems to me, subject to your observations, to be going rather far. A further consideration which is not irrelevant is that we are contemplating (though the Government of India have not, I think, been officially advised of this) as part of the Government of India Bill that, if &lt;*nwt when is transferred -go me Home Government, the equipment, buildings, etc. of the station should be transferred bodily without any special financial adjustment. There are, of course, strong arguments in favour of adopting this course, but if we are to adopt it the point nay well be taken with us that it is rather inconsistent, other considerations apart, to put forward a claim such as the present in respect of the dismantlement of the Aden Railway. A 0 fc I'jla,.Minute Paper. FINANCIAL Department 0^4 L 2956 6000 7/34 Political Secretary , Unless the claim (and equally any claim by the Air Ministry) is ruled out owing to the general War Settlement I think we should prefer it. The loss of Rs. £,75,835 / which allows for a net profit of Rs.305 from the sale of rails^is entirely due to the scrapping of rolling stock and stores originally required for the Sheikh Othman-El Khufylad portion of the line. Now that that section has closed down it does not seem unreasonable that the partners in working it should share the loss on the rolling stock and stores bought for it, the cost of which has not hitherto been charged to them. With regard to the passage marked *A 1 in Mr. Laithwaite's minute it ought, in fairness to the Railway Board, to be mentioned: ( 1 ) that the line has been charged on their budget and has never given^return on the Indian capital invested. As they have been open to criticism on this account they were naturally anxious to cut their loss at the earliest possible moment; (2) that the suggestion that the Sultan of Lahej should take over a section of the line was described by Sir Stewart Symes (letter dated 1st September, 1928, P.5^/28) as 'impracticable'’; (3) that only two offers to purchase are referred to in the papers. The first was accepted; the second came too late. ^ Itt ■Si'* Mr. Grist, For observations and do you consider that claim is barred in any way?INDEXES GOT^im^'n 0?

In continuation of this office letter No.32/765/4/S., dated the 9th July 1934 on the above-noted subject, I am directed to say that the capital cost of the construction of Sheik Othman-31 Khudad Section of the Aden Railway was borne equally by the Army Department of the Government of India. p„nd the War Office of His Majesty»s Government. The latter are, therefore, entitled to half of the sale proceeds of the material released from this Section and, on the other hand, liable for the proportionate cost of dis mantlement and disposal of assets. r* 2. The capital c.st of the Sheik Othman-Bl Khudad Section am.unted to Rs.5 ,01,333/-. It was originally expected in 19g9 . that, having regard to the geographical situation of Aden, Rs. 1,14 ,471/- w.uld be realised from the dismp.ntled material of this Section and that, after meeting the cost of dismantling and disposing of the assets (which was estimated at Rs.45,310/-) the net sale proceeds to be credited to the Array Department and the vr ar Office cf His Majesty’s Government together would amount to Rs. 59,161/-. Actually, h.Hvever, as stated in this office letter qu ted ab ve, the er st cf the dismantlenient cf the line coupled with the depreciation of stores (including less in the disposal of Rolling St.ck) has appreciably exceeded the value of the assetsrealised, 3. The proceeds from the sales relating to the Strategic Section ^ v/hich were made during 1931-32 amount to Hs*30,038/— only, this low figure being largely due to the changed circumstances since the estimate of 1929 was franed, viz., the abnormal world trade conditions which had a prejudicial effect on the quotations for the materials offered for sale. The dismantling charges amounted &gt; J J o CL to Hs.29,733/-, loss on the sale of Rolling Stock to Rs.2,60,051/- °^ / * &gt; ’ J£&gt; and depreciation on stores to Rs-16,089/- (total amounting to *— ——« Rs.3,05,873/-). The net loss attributable to the strategic section 3 o S' # y$ ~ ’ /j 3 £&gt;ol % thus comes to Rs .2,75,835/-, half of which should be borne by the ‘i. oumc .^cessary as regards the loss on the sale of Rolling Stock and the depreciation on stores allocated to the Strategic Section vide paragraph 3 above. The cost of the cial and Strategic Sections of the Aden Railway was debited against the Commercial Section in accordance with the practice obtaining maintenance charges, and including no provision for the amorti sation of the capital cost. If this procedure had not been follow- \ ed, the cost would have been debited in due proportion against the Commercial and Strategic Sections and borne by the parties who financed these Sections. As the entire cost of the stores and Rolling Stock has now been written off the Commercial Section, it \ is only reasonable that the proportionate cost which should have been borne by the Strategic Section initially, should now be borne by that Section. The latest figures available indicate that the net total loss on the sale of Rolling Stock amounts to Rs .3,6o ,436/- and depreciation on stores to Rs.1,08,738/-• Distributing these two losses over both the Sections on the basis of gross receipts and in proportion to the value of assets realised for each Section respectively, the loss to be borne by each Section is as follows*— Government. stores and Rolling Stock required for the joint use of the Commer on the North Western Railway, the Strategic Section paying to the Commercial Section hire charges covering only the interest andTotal loss Commercial Section.

Will you kindly let us know whether any such property, belonging to H.L.G. , is in existence, and if so whether it is for sale and at what price? As best we can, we must get off some answer to Mr. Blackie as quickly as possible. **e know of our surplus rails at Haifa; but I do not recollect hearing of any suruins stuff at present at Aden. Yours sincerely, Y.R.L. TRICKETT B.J. Howard Asq Colonial OfficeTrafalgar House, DOWITEAM MARKET • Norfolk. To, August 17th, 1932. Colonial Secretary for Aden, Westminster. Sir, I have the honour to state that I wish to purchase from you the 40 miles, more or less, of light section railway track now lying in Aden. These rails were laid during the war for communication purposes between Aden and the guard stationed out in the desert. They do not appear to have been in use since the war and they are, in fact, covered over with sand. After so many years lying out of use the rails are in a very bad condition but I still have a use for them. I would be prepared to lift these old rails and I would also purchase any other railway material that is available in Aden, provided always that it is not absolutely useless. I should be prepared to offer you £2,000 Sterling for the 40 miles track, more or less, as they lie at site. A reasonable time would have to be allowed me to take delivery, as I am not acquainted with labour conditions in Aden and sea-freight is not easily obtained from that port. I served in Mesopotamia during the Great War and was a Field Officer in rank.r * I ajn sailing from England for the East early next month and it would he a very good opportunity for me to make preliminary arrangements, as I shall probably be in Aden for a full 24 hours. I understand you have already had several applications for the purchase of these rails, but in each instance it has fallen through owing to buyers not taking up their contracts. I have the honour to request that you will be good enough to advise me by return. I have, etc., (Sgd.) E.B. Blackie. M.S.E,, A.M.I.M.E., F.R.G.S.Tel.

The cost of dismantling and disposal of the track resulted in a loss, and the majority of the correspondence concerns the apportionment of the loss between the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government.The correspondence ends with the Secretary of State for India concluding that a claim cannot be preferred against the Government, due to the
                           Agreement between the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Secretary of State for War (Acting also for the Minister of Pensions) for the Final Settlement of Charges arising out of the Great War and of Certain other Expenditure(1931), known as 'Memorandum C', a copy of which is included at folios 7-22.The file also contains correspondence with F B Blackie, who makes an offer to purchase light railway track from Aden. He is informed that the track has been sold, and is invited to purchase materials from the Burma Railway, consisting of approximately 5000 tons of 41 quarter-pound rails.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
