CONFIDENTIAL No. 0/105 l I H J * T V The Residency, Aden, 16th February, 1932, Sir, I have the honour to refer to your confidential letter of the 5th January 1932 on the subject of the export of arms to Mukalla from Java. 2. It has for long been the established policy of this Residency to discourage, and as far as possible to prevent the acquisition of arms and ammunition by the inhabitants of the Aden Protectorate from any source other than the Residency Armoury. Consistent with this policy has beai the practice that arms and ammunition shall be issued only to recognised Chiefs, or, on their specific recommendation, and in exceptional circumstances, to members of their tribes. These conditions are well known and fully understood in the Protectorate. 3. In regard to the application of Mr Hartman to ship 1000 rifle cartridges to Mukalla on behalf of Abubakar bin Hussein Almohdar, it appears that the latter is the representative of His Highness the Sultan of Mukalla, who is charged with the affairs of Mukalla State during the absence of the Sultan in India. I shall be grateful if you will inform Mr Hartman that his application cannot be approved. 4. For the reasons explained in paragraph 2, above, Mr Hartman should also be informed that permission cannot be accorded to him to set up business in Mukalla as a dealer in arms and ammunition. 5. I shall be grateful if you will request Sheikh Parad to inform his brother Sheikh Amur, that the latter’s application for rifles and ammunition should be addressed to2&amp;1LY1A* to the Representative of the Sultan of Mukalla at that place, for reference to me if the Representative considers it desirable to recommend it. 6. I shall be obliged if you will treat subsequent applications, of the nature of those to \foich you refer, on similar lines in view of the principles explained in paragraph 2 of this letter. I have, etc., (Sgd) B.R.

Sir, © There aeeiss to be among local Arabs a recede sconce of interest in the export of arms and amiuunition to l ofcalla. on the 27th November verbal application was made to me by the firm of P. J.Hartman # Bang Secretarie # Batavia, for permieoion to ship one thousand rifle cartridges to lok&amp;lla on behalf of one &amp;r • Hartman' a letter to the Governor of Aden # 8.12.3l* Confidential fteport of the algemeene Hecherche. f i Abubakar bin Hussein bin Hamid bln Ahmad Almohdar. The applicant was told that if his firm would submit their application in writing the Acting Consul-General would be prepared to consider it with a view to forwarding a copy of it to the authorities at Aden, Next day a representative of the Rotterdam Lloyd steamship company called and made a similar application on behalf of a kr.Reisinger, who was anxious to send a consignment of firearms to Eokalla by one of the company's ships leaving Batavia towards the end of January; the same reply was given on my behalf. In this case the intending purchaser was said to be Abubak&amp;r Alatas, I have little doubt that this is the son of Syed Abubak&amp;r bin Abdulla Alatas (a very prominent and respected Arab of Batavia), who is probably acting on behalf of the Alkaff family so well known in Singapore, nothing more has been heard of this application, probably because I hinted to his father some weeks ago that such requests were not His Majesty's likely Principal Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, LONDON. S.y.l ,likely to meet with much success. On the 8th December Er.Hartman himself came to see me, bringing with him a letter addressed to the 'Governor of Aden**, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy. His story was that he had been approached by two /ifcabs named respectively Saeid bin All bin Seger Alkathrl and Amir bin Saeid bin HOesean, who offered to provide sufficient capital for him to open a branch at Mokalla, in return for five per cent of the profits, which are estimated, I understand, at Jl.20,000 monthly. 1 have asked the Algemeene Becherche (Criminal Intelligence Department) to make enquiries about all these people and to let me know the results; they readily consented to do so but tell me that it may be some time before their investigations are completed to their satisfaction. So far as I know Mr.Hartman is considered respectable enough, lie proposed to obtain hie stock from Hamburg and to sell firearms, ammunition, saddlery, and so forth. 2. 1 have since received from the Algemeene Becherehe a copy of a confidential report (translation enclosed) relative to an application made to a firm of dealers at Bandoeng by two Arabs of Tegal, on the Korth coast of Java, named Sheikh Saleh bin Abdulla Nahdi and sheikh Sultan bln Muhammad Nahdi. 3. A further application has been made to me by one Sheikh Pared bin Salim kukhasin to import into Mokalla two Mauser repeating rifles and two hundred cartridges for his brother sheikh Amur, sheikh Farad said that his family lived in the village of the Al Mukhacia, in the© • 3 • Al Galt Sultan's territory, and were much annoyed by the \ML Al Hahdi tribe and by^Bedawin. The Al Gait sultan, he said, did not take much interest in the Al kukhasin, who had to protect theioselTes; he professed, however, loyalty to the sultan* sheikh Farad's idea is to take the rifles and cartridges with him to lokalla in about two months' time and to hand them over to his brother, who will come down to meet him there* I enquired of the Algemeene Heoherohe whether tkmxmimmacsMXf. smuggling of arms might be expected* The reply was that smuggling from the ports of Java was, as 1 have always believed, practically impossible* It might, however, be practicable from the Hiouw archipelago through Singapore* The attention of the Cue tome authorities has been drawn to the possibilities; their vigilance is constant and I doubt if, in the ports, it is likely to be evaded* 5* I shall not fail to keep you. Sir, apprised of any developments of this matter* In the meantime I am sending a copy of this dispatch to the Resident, Aden, with the request that there may be indicated to me the terms of the reply which should be given to the applications of Mr.Hartman and Sheikh Farad and views on the treatment of any subsequent applications of this nature* A copy i® also being sent to the Governor of the Straits Settlements* I have the honour to be, with the highest respect.

The price of these cartridges was not to be higher than twenty cents each, since cartridges could be obtained at that price at Samarang. permits were respectively available for one Mauser rifle of 6.5 m.m* Ordinance as many as 5,000 oartrdiges may not be delivered. To get round this objection these Arabs proposed that the ca rtridges should be taken in instalments of 200 at a time. This suggestion was not complied with. When questioned the Arabs declared that these cartridges were intended for members of their families in Arabia, and further that the export waejnot so difficult and that they knew how to go about it. The Arabs further sought the firm's intermediary for delivery of ten Mauser rifles, since the manufacturers only delivered to recognised dealers. These rifles were also intended for their relatives and were to be imported through Mokalla or Aden. The firm was to arrange for shipment at Hamburg, wtyile they would do the rest; an import-licence was not necessary since the rifles could easily be brought in. It was further stated that the firm had received during 1930 two similar requests from Arabs, who averred that the arms were to be used in settling quarrels in Arabia. affect could not be given to their request, since their and one of 8.2 m.m., while, moreover, according to the Firearms The ^aadoen^2 - The Bandoeng police thereupon sought information at Tegal and known against these Arabs; they usually stay elsewhere for business. From enquiries made of the arms dealer Schuurman at Samarang it appears that no Bauser rifles or cartridges were sold to Arabs in the year 1931. Mr.Sohuurman however stated that from time to time Arabs have been in his shop, invariably showing extraordinary interest in the Mauser rifles in it; they had also tried to buy cartx^ges, which could not be sold to them since they had no licences. One of the Arabs said that Mauser cartridges were sold Samarang. From investigations at Tegal it appeared that nothing is that it is useless to attempt to buy arms or ammunition there. at 15 cents each at Surabaya, while Schuunaan and the firm of van der Linden at Surabaya asked ££&amp; cents.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002cf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2180</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002cf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2180</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/11 'Aden Protectorate: treatment of applications to export arms to-'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-27T22:48:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (17 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 17; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file opens with a communication received from the HM Consulate-General at Batavia [Jakarta], informing the Aden Political Resident (Bernard Reilly) of formal approaches made to the Consulate to export arms and ammunition from Java [Indonesia] to Mokalla [Mukalla].
