VYe assume that you will let us know if at any time His Majesty's Government should decide that, with a view to augmenting the oil resources available to them, the Company should be pressed to reverse this policy and to accelerate and expand their operations in Koweit.

Dear GiLson, In march last, Mr. L.D. Scott attended a conference with the Hohble. the Political Resident and other representatives of H.M. Government at which were discussed the steps to 'be taken in Kuwait in the event of war. The Political Resident was anxious that our wells should 'be adequately safeguarded against enemy action, and that we should take particular care against such types of action as those which took place in the region of Bushire during the last war. The Board decided, therefore, that in the event of war any live wells should he mudded off. This procedure is quite usual in oil field practice and is not harmful to the wells, which can he brought hack to their original condition hy de-mudding. On the outbreak of war. Wells Nos. 1 and 2 were ^ . forthwith mudded off. With regard to Well No.3, the position is that this well has only recently been completed and casing has been set with its foot in bottom water. It was the Board’s intention, in the ordinary course, to have this well tested by gun-perforating the casing from the bottom upwards. In the present circumstances, however, they feel that it would be inadvisable to do so and that the well itself and the oil resources of Kuwait would be better protected if the well were mudded off and the test postponed. As you are aware, however, it was also the Board’s intention to consider making a declaration that oil had been found in commercial quantities when Burgan No. 3 Well had J.P.Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. been/2. teen tested and if satisfactory results had teen ottained. xhe Board feel tnat without this information they will not hand, they are anxious to do everything they reasonably can to prevent H.rl. the Shaikh from suffering loss as a result of action necessitated ty war. Although they do not regard uo. 3 '.veil, they intend on 23rd December next and annually be entitled had the declaration been made, i.e., Royalty of Rupees 250,000 per annum. The Board have also had under consideration the policy to oe adopted for the Company’s operations in Kuwait in the regard to tne general financial, economic and industrial conditions which must prevail during wartime, the Board find it necessary to restrict the Company’s activities in Kuwait to the present one-rig programme instead of the two rigs wnich they had hoped to adopt early in 1940. The Board still in Kuwait which they had decided upon before the outbreak of war, and will endeavour to supply the equipment, etc. needed for this investigation with the least possible delay, me information contained in this letter has been be in a position to make the declaration. On the other themselves a s justified in prejudging the results of Burgan thereafter to offer His Highness the amount to which he would changed circumstances arising out of the war. Having intend, however, to proceed with the search for fresh water communicated m Major Holmes and Mr. Scott for submission to His Highness. 4 hi Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

S. it appears from the enclosed copy of a telegram from ( c °V ±es of which have already been 1939 Circulated) that the Sheikh is far from M ^ . “ satisfied with the Company’s decision, and the Resident invites us to press the Company to reconsider it. For our C V part we think tllat on the financial side the Company have dealt quite fairly with the Sheikh, all things considered, and we had in mind to tell the Resident that in the light of what Starling said in the above-quoted letter we did not at present see sufficient ground for intervening. Before doing so, however, we should wish to learn whether the Admiralty agree with the Petroleum Department letter, and I should be grateful if you could inform me on this point at a very early date. ane Admiralty attitude would seem to depend on (a) The suitability of Koweit oil for naval requirements c-nd (b), if u^e oil is suitable, the degree of importance attached bj the Admiralty to developing a reserve source of supply at Koweit.

The following telegram is from Rhoades and Jameson stop We have had meeting at Basrah with Holmes and Scott to consider following communication from Shaikh of Kuwait to Holmes begins: After consideration and consultation with the Political Agent I have come to the conclusion that in order to avoid any danger of the Concession Agreement terms being brought into question, I have decided to withdraw my request that the Company should increase the amount of the Royalty minimum payment from Rupees two hundred and fifty thousand per annum to Rupees four hundred thousand per annum. I now withdraw that suggestion and replace it with the request*that the Company should make me an advance against future royalties, and as an alternative proposal suggest Firstly the Kuwait Oil Company shall make to me an advance against royalty by yearly instalments of the sum of rupees two hundred thousand each, for a period of five years. The first instalment of such advance against royalty shall be made to me by the Company on March 1st 1940. The remaining instalments of rupees two hundred thousand each, shall be made on each anniversary of the date which the first payment is made. The final payment being made on March 1st 1944. This advance shall be free of interest. Secondly the Company at any time subsequent to March 1st 1944, may deduct each year ten per cent from all royalty which may become due to me, in excess of the sum of rupees four hundred and fifty thousand per annum until the whole sum of/ . iof rupees one million has been recovered by the company. Thirdly it must be clearly understood that this advance made by the company is an advance against royalty and not in any manner a loan. The advance made is not recoverable by the company, except from royalties that may become due to me on the oil produced. Rhoades and Jameson recommend this for favourable consideration but suggest the recovery to be made as under: Nil until royalty exceeds five hundred thousand rupees. Twenty per cent of excess in any year when royalty exceeds five hundred thousand rupees but is less than nine hundred thousand rupees. 7/hen royalty exceeds nine hundred thousand rupees repayment to be made up of twenty per cent of difference between five hundred thousand rupees and nine hundred thousand rupees plus in addition one hundred per cent of excess over nine hundred thousand rupees.

In fact he has refused to act at all without my advice, which, while “being somewhat eaibarras* J sing, shows that he is turning to the Political autho rities again with trust. I have given what little advice I had to give as sparingly as possible. Yours sincerely, CKuwait,22nd, February 1940. My dear Major Holmes, After consideration and consultation with the Political Agent, I have come to the conclusion that in order to avoid any danger of the Concession Agreement terms being brought into questioi I have decided to withdraw my request that the Company should increase the amount of the Royalty minimum payment from Rs. 250,000 per annum to Rs.400,000 per annum. I now withdraw that suggestion and replace it with the request that the Company should make me an advance against future Royalty. In making this proposal, I feel that you will agree with me ^at I am within rights in requesting additional financia help-from the Coripany- seeing that I had been led to hope that a declaration of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities would be made during the late months of 1939. If such declaration had been made, the increased development activities whioh-in the ordinary course- the Company would have undertaken, thereby giving my work-people the opportunity of work and hastening the day that regular production of oil would eventuate. I request that I may ask for an extension- to be agreed upon between the Company and myself,-after the expiry of the period of the first five years, if the production of oil-at that time- ha s not reached the stage where the yearly revenue in the form of Royalty does not equal the minimum Royalty of Rs.250,000 plus the yearly advance against Royalty of Rs.200,000 mentioned below, making a total of Rs.450,000. And such an extension -if any be made- shall be upon the same terms and conditions-exoept as to the period of extension -as mentioned in the following suggestion. SUGGESTION . (a) The Kuwait Oil Company shall make to me an advance against Royalty by yearly instalments of the sum of Rs.200,000. each, for a period of five (5) years. The first instalment -of such advance against Royalty- shall be made to me by the Company on March 1st, 1940. The remaining instalments of Rs.200,000.each, shall be made on each anniversary of the date on which the first payment is made, The final payment being mad 3 on March 1st, 1944. This advance shall be free of interect. (b) The Company at any time subsequent to March 1st, 1944, may deduct each year 10% from all Royalty which may become due to me, in excess of the sum of Rs.450,000. per annum until the whole sum of Rs. 1,000,000. has been recovered by the Company. (o) It must be clearly understood that this advance made by the Company is an advance against Royalty, and not in any manner a loan. The advance made is not recoverable by the Company, except from Royalties that may become due to me on the oil produced. I trust thet the Board of the Kuwait Oil Company Limited, will decide regarding the above request with as little delay as possible. Please convey my compliments to the Board.

L TKx **^*Jki**A- ^t£_ 1 /-iAAAA *_} ^ . 7X fc Kuwait•2nd February,1940 My dear Major Holmes, I would like to inform you that I have understood what you stated to me about the discussion you had in London with the Board of Directors of the K.O.C., about my letter to you on 14th November last regarding the annual royalty due to me upon the declaration of the commercial production of oil in my State* Now I find it necessary to make my observations as follow on your statement* Firstly, the Company should furnish me with reasons in detail which caused them to reduce their activities and to cancel most of their programme of work for 1940, on pretext that there is no facility for them to get sufficient materials they require for the proscution of their activities. You are aware, I believe, that the convoy system of the merchant ships between U.K*, 17.S.A., my State., etc., is working very effectively and with much success. Secondly, my demand for the sum of Rs*400,000(Rupess four lacs) as a royalty is in fact a minimum amount in proportion to the Company's activities here, and I found it advisable to mention here again about this amount which, I believe, will”at least compensate my State for the hardship and troubles it has to face owing to the present circumstances. In the meantime, the above amount of royalty shall remain force for a period of fonr years(4) from 23rd December 1939 or until the six months after the end of the War whichever provesto be the shorter period. The date upon which the . ar will be considered as ended is the date upon which the peace ^ treaty is signed by Great Britain with Germany. Thridly, as I consider this matter very important, I would like to^ know if any of the Oil Companies operating in Arabia has closed down their activities or is intending to do so, and whether these Companies are not getting their supply of materials for their operations. Lastly, I am fully convinced that their interpretation of the 'WAR* Article in the Agreement between the Company and myself is very narrow and literal, paying no attention to the real circumstances existing at present. As there is very regular and effective convoy system of merchant ships, they can conveniently get their supply of necessary materials under this system# They can right1J bring this Article into force, if the sea route between U.K., U.S.A., and the British empire is blockaded for the merchant ships. I therefore have to point out to you my above points of view requesting you to forward them to the Board of Directors for — 1 their careful consideration and favourable reply as soon as possible P As regards the other matters of minor importance, I will let you know afterwards. With best regards, Major. Frank Holmes, Official Representative in London# Yours sincerely, Tl { r t ILMi T).0. No. C/158 Political Agency, Kuwait, 12th April, 1940, My dear Gibson, 1940.

January, 1940 Secret. ^.i * Dear Jarrett, Would you please refer to your letter of the 9th January, No. M.07772/39, regarding the suggested acquisition by the Kuwait Oil Company of a concession covering an area lying outside Koweit territorial waters. 2. I am afraid we should find it difficult to accept the suggestion that His Majesty's Government should take the responsibility of deciding, and informing the Sheikh, that the whole matter should be left over until after the war, That the Company should be reluctant to take up, and still more to operate, such a concession in present conditions is understandable, having regard to commercial considerations only. But it is hard to see with what justification, or even with what right, His Majesty's Government should 'decide 11 that the question should be postponed until after the war. I imagine the only reason that His Majesty's Government could give would be that their preoccupation with the conduct of the war did not leave them sufficient time to give the Company the advice it desired on certain points to enable it to answer the Sheikh's advances. I am afraid this sound to us more impressive than convincing. C.G. Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, S.W.l. COPY SENT TO. |l -*^ ^ ■2. 3. As you know, the Sheikh's relations with the Company are somewhat strained at present. He has had a growing feeling that their activities compare unfavourably with the energy displayed by the Standard Oil Co. in Bahrein and Kasa, and the feeling has been accentuated by the Company’s recent decision to slow down operations on account of the war. The Sheikh will scarcely welcome a decision to postpone consideration of the 'deep-sea” concession, and naturally the Company are reluctant to announce it as theirs, but that seems insufficient reason for His Majesty’s Government to incur the odium of communicating it to the Sheikh. 4. he should therefore much prefer to return some answer, not necessarily an elaborate one, to the specific queries raised by the Company, and we should be grateful if, on reconsideration, you could find it possible to assist us with a brief statement of the Admiralty views. 5. We are still awaiting the views of the Foreign Office and Petroleum Department also, and I am sending to Eyres and Eavenshear a copy of your letter and of this reply. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PEEUP.Z. 172/40. Military Branch Admiralty, M. 07772/39. 9th January, 1940 SECRET. Dear Peel V/e are now in a position to give you an answer to your letter of the 2nd August last P.Z. 4603/39 concerning proposals for the Kuwait Oil Company to acquire a concession from the Sheikh of Kuwait covering an area lying outside Kuwait territorial waters. Owing to the outbreak of war, and as the questions raised involved the delimitation of the northern limits of Kuwait waters, and arbitrary sea boundaries to the area fixed upon, it was thought better to arrange if possible for the matter to be left over until after the war, when proper detailed consideration could be given to it. An opportunity was therefore taken to obtain the informal views of the Company on postponement, and it is now understood that they would welcome a decision to leave the whole matter over until after the war, but as the question was originally raised by Kuwait, it would assist them in their relations with the Sheikh if the decision to postpone were communicated to him as coming from His Majesty’s Gove rumen t. When eventually the question does come up for discussion, I gather that there would be no objection on the Company’s part to the definition of an area in rather general terms and a working arrangement made with the Company to confine their operations to an area with regard to which a dispute with either Saudi Arabia or Iraq would not be likely to arise. I am presuming that the above will meet your views and will render unnecessary at the present time any detailed remarks on the questions of the acquisition of the sea-bed, whether Kuwait Bay is or is not a territorial inlet, and where the northern limit of Kuwait territory actually runs. In any case, it is understood that the boundary of the concession area suggested by Major Holmes is merely tentative and has no particular geological significance. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) C.G. JARRETT. R. T. Peel, Esq. , M. C. , India Office, S. W. 1.MB’ / P.7.1X74/40 Id. 01966/40 srcr . Dear Feel, In r eply to your letter of the 26th January, No• P*2♦178/40, concerning the suggested acquisition by the Kuwait Oil Company of a concession coyering an area lying outside Kuwait territorial waters, I write to say that our main reason for suggesting that consideration of the matter should be postponed until after the war was that the limits of the concession suggested by the Oil Company raised difficult and awkward questions regarding the boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq. ‘X'he position of the frontier waa the subject of consideration recently in connection with a suggested IraqlJk-73 n port in the Khor Abdullah (see Foreign office letter •£1167 r ^j^v/ 58/9;* of the 5th August) end it is clear that tue whole question oven of the land frontier ie extremely obscure. To fix a boundary ruining out to sea within which oil concessions can be granted by Kuwait is even more difficult, and to attempt to do so nw we3.1 give ri ?e to trouble with Iraq, to say nothing of possible Iranian reactions, even if no question with eudi-Arabia arises as regards the outh- astern boundary. Apart from any views held by the Oil Company, -o should find it very difficult in present circumstances to give adequate ^ consideration to the problem* hnu v?e should imagine that the sane applies to the Foreign Office, ‘/ho a-e still more concerned in that they have ta take into account the effect of any action on our relations with uwalt’s neighbours* 1 ilitary Branch, Adroiralty, S.V .1* £. r rd February, I C *4G. AP It will* also* we think be very diffic^ili for the Oil Company* under war conditions, to take up actively the examination and development of an additional area, and foul tiiat, from their point of view, it is Quito reason able to ask for a postpone ment • , obviously, however, cannot push t^ese objections too far, and if both you ana the Foreign Office ere agreed that It is neoessar , for political reasons, to go on with the matter now, i e can only suggest the t the boundaries of the concession should be i efined in such general terms as not to raise any ve;;ed questions of the extent of the dhuilch 1 e jurisdiction# What we have in mind is that instead of aaov/ing the seaward boundaries on a chart, we should define them In eoeno mich general way as rt bounc.e&amp; on the wouthr-Eaat by a strai^it line drawn fron^ the point at which the territorial waters of F owe it rnd the neutral zone meet, in a direction at right angles to the coast (or the general trend of the coast, if this is thought preferable) and on the North .ast by a straight line drawn fror: the point farthest to seaward at hich the territorial waters of Kuwait and Iraq meet, in a direction following the trend of the boundary between Kuwaiti and Iraqi v/aters to the point of intersection with the first line”. This is, of course, onl;; a rough idea and we should have to examine the exact terms r ore closely before we finally decided upon them# As we stated in our letter of the 1th January, we understand that the Company will be quite willing to agree to some workin arrangement, under which they would coniine their operations to an ax^es with regard to which a dispute with either Cauditor Iraq would not be likely to arise# Arabia fe are not sure v/hether, in the circumstances, it is necessary to define the extent of Kuwait territorial waters, but our views are that the configuration of 1 oweit Bay would justify its being regarded as a territorial inlet with a closing line from Ras al Ardh to the South-west extreme corner of Falakah Island, a distance of abo’ t 9$ miles, wrovidod that there is R.T#f 00-:-, Ksq# * .&gt;• '/•* —-—'Af&lt;w ' India Office, I ^ .Kk.SmP l/(V'2 . evidence of a long exercise of Jurisdiction over the areo in. cuestion.

They are necessarily provisional in respect of boundary lines/ and the interested Departments would wish to give them further consideration in consultation with the authorities in the Persian Gulf before the discussions between your Company and the Sheikh crystallise into a definite agreement. 3. (a) You asked 'what exclusive and non-exclusive rights has H.H. the power to grant in the form of an oil concession over the area indicated in Major Holmes’s map'. I I should say at the outset that this area could not be accepted as it stands, since it raises boundary questions which, partly because the Koweit-Iraq frontier has not yet been delimited, it would be impossible to settle at the present time. It would be preferable, instead of showing the seaward boundaries of the area on a chart, to describe the area in more general terms and in a way that would avoid the possibility of boundary disputes with neighbouring ^ countries. If you wish to pursue the matter we are prepared to consider whether we can suggest a provisional formula for the purpose. I should at the same time make it clear that any definition of the extent of Koweit territory which may be agreed to for the purposes of the proposed concession should not be regarded as precluding H.M.G. from giving the Sheikh such advice as they may see fit to give him at any time in the future with regard to the disposition of his territory. In reply to your specific enquiry, the Sheikh cannot grant any exclusive or non-exclusive rights over any area lying outside his territorial waters. But if the phrase 'submerged land belonging to the Sheikh' were used in the concession, the effect would be that your Company would have the right to exploit submerged land outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it by sinking shafts. The appropriation would have the effect of vesting the land in the Sheikh from the point of view of sovereignty, since H.r.Kemp, Esq., Kuwait Oil Co., Britannic House, Finsbury Square, E,C.2. •OPY SENT BY AIR M A,L -&gt; T — JPY SENT BY AIR MAIL r\t 2 (■ ^ OOPY SENT BY-MR~MAIl. of . &lt;&gt;• ir o . y u. M ? c ysthe Company Would he working under a concession from the Sheikh* This would not deprive any other Company of the right to sink shafts in adjacent areas outside territorial waters if they wished to do so. (h) Secondly, you enquired whether H.M.G. would have any objection to your Company negotiating and concluding a concession agreement with the Sheikh. I am to say in reply that in principle H.M.G. would have no objection, provided that the area of the concession is so defined as to preclude the possibility of frontier disputes with neighbouring countries and subject to other comments in this letter and to approval of the actual terms of the concession agreement. H.M.G. would of course require the Company to enter into a pre-emption agreement with them. (c) Lastly, you raised the question of the extent of Koweit’s territorial waters. This raises, or may raise, some difficult problems and a definite reply cannot be given to you at present. We understand that the configuration of Koweit Bay would justify its being claimed as a territorial inlet provided that there is evidence of longstanding exercise if jurisdiction over its waters. If this proviso were satisfied (a point on which the local political authorities would have to be consulted Koweit Bay as national territory could be regarded as bounded by a line joining Has al Ardh with the northern headland of the bay, or possibly by lines connecting (a) the SW.corner of Pailakah Island with Ras al Ardh and (b) the N.W* corner of the Island with the nearest point of the mainland on the north side of the Bay. Territor ial waters would extend three miles seawards of these lines. 4. I hope the foregoing will be found a sufficient reply to your letter for your present purposes.

Will you please refer to your telegram No. 71 of the 20th January, 1941? I have not yet received India Office that the picture the India Office have gathered of the impor tunate attitude of the Shailch with regard to presents is not correct. He, true enough, likes something for nothing, hut it was Holmes vho jockeyed the Company into the Buick, and Scott who landed them for a Wireless. 3. The idea of the Buick was put into the Shaikh # s head hy Holmes at the time of Jameson f s visit in January last year, Jameson did not commit himself, hut said that if the Shaikh were to ask the Kuwait Oil Company to place an order for a oar it might so happen that no hill would he sent. Holmes, presumably to feather his own cap, must have put the facts falsely to the Shaikh, and told him that he had induced the Kuwait Oil Company to present him with a car. The Kuwait Oil Company, on their part, kept to Jameson’s word, and so in the autumn of last year Holmes was forced to write to the Shaikh that if he wanted a car he would have to place an order. Having thus defeated the machinations of Holmes, the Kuwait Oil Coropany played the game and promised a Buick to the Shaikh. Holmes thereupon sent a telegram to the Shaikh cancelling his letter. 4. As regards the tireless, the Shaikh asked the Kuwait Oil Company to purchase one for him. thereupon Scott sugges ted/ Hon’hle Lieut-Colonel C.G. i^ior, CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 0% \ 2- ted that the set should he a present to the Shaikh. The Company, having in mind a hundred pounds or so, agreed and the Shaikh was duly informed. It was only then that they decided that they needed fuller details, and from these it appears that the set is to cost thousands. Scott then asked me my views and thought perhaps tfc I might like to forhid the pre sentation on political grounds. To this I could not agree and suggested that he should tell the Shaikh that the set he wanted my demi-official letter No. C/210 of the 10th May, 1940) and I have nothing more to add except that now that the Shaikh^s Aide is not with him, he is not in a position to 'broadcast, and probably no longer wants to. Nevertheless, while I see no objection to the Shaikh’s broadcasting, I think on the whole it would be better if the Company could be helped to escape from their undertaking. The Shaikh may still hanker after a new set but it can only be a white elephant to him and as he is getting a luxurious Buick, specially screened for short wave reception from the Kuwait Oil Company, and two Dodge pick-ups from the 'Sulphur Company' this year I think 6. I, therefore, suggest that the Company should be prevented from presenting a Wireless on the pretext of the war, and should instead set up in the desert on behalf of the Shaikh watering facilities for the bedouin. This would be practicable, iroughly equivalent in cost and excellent propa ganda and a solution to which the Shaikh would find it could not be obtained in war time. It seems now'that Scott’s approach failed. to the Shaikh’s broadcast 5 It has already been decided that there is no objection haikh’s broadcasting (vide correspondence ending with ing (vide correspondence ending he should be made to go without the set difficult to object Yours sincerely,Tele^r^m ITrcrri To Repeated to Fo.

W. j 1 ! D iwa'i S. S* GENiii’RAL . After a short interview with h.H. The Sheikh discussions were continued with His Highness’s Vizier. The Vizier (and for that matter His Highness himself) pro/ed to oe a very keen a.iateur wireless enthusiast. The Vizier is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and I formed the opinion that he is undoubtedly competent to handle and maintain a medium power installation, especially if it is by a GOm P e tent engineer who is willing to impart all the information available at the time of^installation. I gathered the impression that the wireless installation at Kuwait is more m the nature of a useful hobby, and that whilst tne oust possible results are desired, the maintenance of communication is not regarded as of paramount importance. The installation at present in use is of a type which is popular amongst amateur radio men in America. It has an output power of 50 watts to the aerial and is used by His Highness and others for communicating with .King Ibn Saud and memoeys of the Court at Hiyadh. Cominunication takes acc °Pding to a pre-arranged schedule, and is Sai a to be satisiactory. The distance between Kuwait and Riyadh is about 360 miles, the intervening country beinp 1 sandy desert. G Having scored a certain amount of success with this low powered equipment His Highness is anxious to extend his activities as follows 1. To improve existing communication with Riyadh. To establish direct communication with Mecca and Medina. 3. To use the existing 50 watts outfit for keeping in touch v/ith Kuwait when he is himself travelling in the district. The above are his immediate aims but there is little doubt that if he is successful he will shortly wish to include Baghdad, Beirut and even Cairo in the range of his communications. To improve upon his present methods of broadcasting gramophone records and announcements. There is no doubt that he will eventually desire to broadcast programmes of music performed in a studio by bands of two or three instrumentalists and vocalists. PESORIFTIOR OR THE TO TAKE i LAO.., AND ..COUNTRY OVER WHICH TRANSMISSIONS DISTANCES TO BE COVERED. ARE The country as a whole is flat and largely composed of sandy deserts. Kuweit^ to ecca . Distance approximately 750 miles. There are practically no hil^s between the two places excepting a range/range which commences about 100 miles before Mecca. The highest peaks do not reach 3,000 feet. Kuwait-Medina . Distance approximately 600 miles. The country rises to about 2,000 ft. half way to Medina. Kuwait-Riyadh . Distance approximately 360 miles. No intervening hills of note, mostly flat desert. Kuwait-Baghdad . Distance approximately 350 miles. Plat country, no intervening hills. K uwait-Beirut . Distance approximately 800 miles. The Lebanon mountains with peaks approaching 10,000 ft intervene close to Beirut. FREQUENCIES (Wavelengths) ihe frequencies at present in use for transmission from Kuwait are:- Reception is carried out on various frequencies(wavelengths), but the most successful receptions from Mecca and Riyadh appear to be obtained when those stations are transmitting on approximately 11,000 K/cs. (27 metres). BROADCASTING- OF GRAMOPHONE RECORDS . As they do not possess a suitable electrical 'Pick up' the broadcasting of gramophone records is at present accomplished by placing a microphone in close proximity to a mechanical gramophone. This is of course, entirely unsatisfactory, and a proper gramophone attachment will have to be provided with the new equipment. * 1 2 3 After considering the- matter for a week, and taking His Highness s obvious ambition into consideration, I have arrived at the conclusion that an output power of 250 watts is the minimum that is likely to prove satisfactory. SPECIFICATION TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE MANUFACTURERS . Radio Telephone Equipment. power Cutout required - Not less than 250 watts unmodulated Carrier. Frequencies - The following spot frequencies controlled by pietzo-electrie crystals arc required. A frequency tolerance of .05/o is permissible. It must be possible to pre-set the tuning circuits to these frequencies, so that during operation selection can be carried out by means of switches on the front of the apparatus, (1) 17600 Kilocycles. (2) 11700 ' (3) 8000 ' the/the only tuning adjustments to be accomplished by the operator being those necessary in the aerial circuits. It is desirable that the apparatus should be continuously tunable throughout the frequency range 5000 to 17750 Kilocycles by means of a valve iV&amp;Jter n iclLl a tor but if considerations of economy are affected we are prepared to tolerate gaps in this range provided that the Master Oscillator can be tuned to the following special frequencies ( i) 4800 Kilocycles. (5) 5500 ' Telephony - The audio input is to be taken direct from a suitable microphone and reasonably high fidelity is expected between frequencies of 50 and 4000 cycles per second. The microphone will be used in the same room or in a room in close proximity to the transmitter. Means must be provided for the suppression cf the carrier so that reception may be accomplished in the same room when speech is not being transmitted, in order that a form of duplex telephony may be accomplished. To avoid expense we are prepared to accept a manually operated device in the form of a control button or switch which will not accomplish true duplex telephony but which will allow the rapid switching of the carrier so that question and answer can be exchanged without long delays whilst valves are heating up, etc. Gramophone Transmissions - While some importance is attacheJ^u' •che' ’'broadcasting of gramophone records the type of music likely to be dealt with does not warrant the expense of broadcasting equipment with straight line characteristics throughout the musical scale. If the apparatus is suitable for high grade commercial speech it will meet our requirements. The apparatus should comprise an electrically driven gramophone turntable a robust n pick up' and a 'Mixing panel' which will select either Microphone or Gramophone or both, for the purpose of making announcements. Telegraphy - Although the equipment is primarily required for the transmission of telephony, telegraphic signalling may be required occasionally. Unless the apparatus offered is equipped with a keying circuit for C.^ r . and I.C.w. transmission as a standard feature, it will be sufficient to supply a telegraph signalling key with 800 cycles buzzer or oscillator suitable for connection to the Audio frequency input circuit in place of the microphone. Antenna System - It is proposed to install the equipment in a room on the ground floor of a two storey building and to erect an aerial system on the roof. A feeder system will be necessary the minimum length of the feeder being about 100 feet. The site is open and adaptable so that any standard arrangement proposed by the Manufacturers can readily be carried out.y v A good earth connection in permanent moisture readily available. Receiving Apparatus - A high grade communications receiver covering fh.e frequency ranges 54.0 to 6200 kilocycles is requiredc Power Supply - A Petrol driven water cooled generating planT'wiII be required of a rating suitable for supplying the power required - by the radio equipment plus an auxiliary load of 500 volt/amperes. It is thought that from the above specification Messrs Collins Radio Company should be able to modify their equipment Type 30J to meet our requirements. As regards the choice of receiving equipment, wo prefer the Ralicrafter skyrider Model SX-17 which has proved a great success on our own stations in Iran. As an alternative if the SX-17 should not be available we would recommend the Hammarlund Type KQ-120-X. If a 250 watts transmitter is supplied, the equivalent power plant would be that given as No.2 in Messrs. CoJ-lins Radio Company's letter i.e. 2000 watts 110 volts 60 cycles. \ As regards spare parts, the most important items would be valves, of which not less than two spares of each type should be provided. American valves are notoriously short lived in this part of the world. A stock of such things as resitances *&gt;t condensers could be chosen from the Makers spare part lists after the equipment has been delivered to us. (^d) FINDING. i 29.6.40.* i. SECB^T . ' D.O.NO.

The following articles after check were found to have been stolen, 8 motor tyres, 15 inner tubes and 74 boxes of cigarettes /50 oig.eaoh), 2, The store room which was broken into is one of two underground 'cool' rooms, situated inraedi&amp;tely in rear of the Gongpany* a main store godown at Magwa and used for storing perishable rubber goods such as tyres, hoses etc. Both are approached by flights of steps with heavy doors at bottom. The doors themselves are kept looked and bolted by means of pad-locks. The keys of both pad-locks being kept in charge of the senior Indian store keeper Mr. Nair, and issue* are only made in his presence, or in the presence of his assistant, also an Indian. The pad-look of the door of the underground room from which the articles V^fere stolen was found sawn through, and the door left wide open, by the keeper himself on the morning of 16th Novenfcer. The padlock of the door of the second room had had its face tom off only, but the thieves were evidently satisfied with what they had found in the first store room, so they did not continue their work of breaking the lock and nothing was ete taken from this second room. For purposes of record it nay be recalled that on receipt of the first telephone message from the Drilling Superintendent, Magwa, reporting the above theft, on the morning of 16th November, the General Superintendent immediately sent the C.L.R. to report the matter to Mr. Abdulla Mulla, with an official request that the matter be at once put into the hands of the acting governor of the Town and Director of public security with a a view to the possible apprehension of the tliAeves and the recovery of the stolen property. This was done to save time and to enable Mr. Abdulla Mulla and Shaikh Abdulla al Mubarak to adopt any immediate measures (such as informing gate guards eto) that they might consider reeevegyr necessary. S ^ - ^ : The C.L.R. was further instructed to tell Mr. Abdulla Mulla that an official •~v&gt; ^ letter from the General Superintendent would follow in due course, 6. The writer takes a serious view of the oase as it is the first time that the Company has had a robbery on anything like as large a soale since it oonmenced operations in Kuwait. 7* The fact that a selection of tyres and inner tubes only were taken from a large stock standing in different racks in the store room, suggests that the thieves were experts and knew what they wanted exactly, also ii-ie possible that they were working in a small party and from a singlejushed in the vicinity of the camp area. It is further suggested that 3 men would have been able fairly conveniently to carry the articles stolen, a distance of say 600 yards, leaving a fourth man to mind the oar. 8 . It may be mentioned that a careful oheck was made of all articles stored ' in the underground room in cjiestion early in November and everything was found correct. Furthermore, the Indian store keeper himself had occasion to open the said store room on the afternoon of Friday 15th November, to get some soda bottle stoppers out. He found every thing in order and looks intact. 9. As the matter has now been handed over to H.H*s Director of public security for investigation and necessary action, the writer is naturally lothe to offer advioe, but he would suggest jlhat the possibility of collusion kaJLxjutsx between the thieves and some r residing inside the Magwa oairp area be not overlooked. . Four Company guards and the Head guard were on duty at Magwa on the night of the roobeiy and it has been established that two patrols were sent out and passed the underground store room in question at about 8 p.m. and 10KUWAIT OIL CGMFANI, LIMITED, Britannic House, i'inabury CJircus, London, . .2* 18 th Au^cust, 1 %. 1 - Por the attention of Mr* -i*sr*R.Lumb/, External Lepart nent* The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, S.W*1.

Confidential My dear Colonel, I acknowledge your letter of the 10th in connection with my official letter to you offering one years renewal of your present Agreement with the Company There is no need whatever for you to worry about the proposed year to year basis and it was merely introduced on account of present conditions and the fact that you will already have reached the age of 61 years when the present offer commences and under happier circumstances you would, no doubt by now, have begun to consider when to retire. As you say the retention of your services as C.L.R. rests largely with KhH. the Sheikh, and H.M.3. as well as with the Company, and whether contractual renewals are made yearly or three yearly is not likely to have any bearing whatever on the ultimate length of your service with the Company, whereas the shorter ^ term does leave you free to decide year by year what action you wish to take. 1 discussed this matter with Mr Jameson when he was here - but not at great length - and if you particu larly wish to tie yourself for a further three years 1 will take up the matter for you when 1 visit Iran in the next few- days, jT\ Yours sincerely, (signed; L.D.Scott.

Your Highness, Greetings. In response to Your Highness 11 request received through Mr.Abdullah Mulla Saleh, we confirm the following points of our conversation of the 8 th August, in case there should have been any misunderstanding over the interpretation of them:- Work in hand; The tidying up of the wells etc* in the Burgan area has been completed and the fencing of Weil B.G-.9 is in hand. Well No.M~10 is nearly dismantled and after completion of this work it will be fenced with expanded metal. It is expected that the dismantling at M-10 will complete on or about the 13 th instant. The min work in hand at present is the listing and checking of plant and materials and the transporting of heavy gear to Shuwaikh. Your Highness asked if all the wells were safe and we informed Your Highness that they were and that a guard post will remain at Warah and that Col ..Dickson will be expected to visit all wells twice a week -Then the Company’s work has been suspended. Paying off of Kuwaiti Em ployaes: • It has been decided, that when the service# of the surplus Kuwaiti employees are dispensed with, an ex gratia payment will be made to each individual at the rate of two weeks pay for each completed year of service. This bonus is granted specifically in connection y/ith the suspension of the Company’s operations and should not be regarded as forming a precedent. It is proposed to pay off 15 rigmen in the course of the next two or three days and about another 15 at the end of the week, thereafter a steady reduction will follow. Transfer of Staff : Messrs. MacIntyre, Wallace and Miss Tull have already left Kuwait and during the next week or ten days Me as rs.S. Clark ,D. Robinson and D, Dunlop will be leaving. As regards Messrs.Kuss and Guntz further information is awaited from London and America but it seems probable that these two members of the Staff will leave Kuwait within the next two weeks or so. When the Staff has been sufficiently reduced it will be possible to commence on the reduction of our engineering services. Plant and Mat erial:. Further details regarding the disposal or otherwise of our plant and stores are expected to be received through Mr.N.A.G-ass, in the course of/next Jf&amp;w days.Suspended Baais : It is proposed to continue to rent the office building in Kuwait and the houses occupied by Messrs.Scott and Oarapbell, the house occupied by our clerks a owned by Mr.Yousuf Yacub, will edso be retained for the present,, Guard posts will be maintained at Magwa, Warah and Shuwaikb. and except for these posts Magna will probably be shut down as a re si- • dentinl area- the workmen who axe retained, will lire at their homes in the town and will be sent out to work daily* Medical Service; The services of the Mission Doctor will continue to be retained and when our Assistant Surgeon can be released, arrangements will be made for the Mission Dispenser to visit Magwa and Warah guard posts and the work at Burgan every other day, to hold a sick parade.

The Array having sent down their vehicles' without giving us adequate time to obtain tho necessary equipment from Abadan, have assisted us by providing temporarily a compressor and digging unit to help with the work. With this assistance it is expected that an approximate daily output of LOO cu.ft (1A to 1 h tons) will be obtained* The system of measurement that was agreed, vide our letter 529A of 30/5/h2 has been put into operation. The quality check of the bitumen is carried out by first weighing a small quantity of the material and then •washing it in kerosene and petrol until all trace of bitumen is removed^ * the sand residue is then dried and weighed. The difference between the result of the two weighings being the v/eight of the actual bitumen content. Daily statements of the amount of the material mined and delivered into the Array trucks are forwarded to our Kuwait Office and a weekly summary of these will be forwarded to H*H ! s Official Representative, An enquiry was then made as to whether Your Highness wished to take any other measures to safeguard Your Highness’ interests in the matter* It was understood that Tour Highness indicated uhat you would like to consider the matter,, Subsequently it was stated that Mr,Dover would be in charge of the bitumen work and that Abdul Salaam would act as his overseer at Burgan* It was anticipated that the extra equipment from*Abadan would arrive within the next week or so and that the bitumen work would be on a sound producing basis in about two weeks time* Assuring Your Highness of our best wishes, We remain^ Yours faithfully, (SGD)L.D.

We therefore feel that although the effect on public opinion locally may be unfortunate, we are not in a position to encourage further development in this area. The aame conaiderations also apply to ^,atar and we are at the moment considering v/hether we ought to recommend that operations in this area should also be discontinued and the existing wells immolilised• I will write to you again as soon as any conclusion ia reached.

Compensation for war damage to Oil Companies.Received under India Office Printed Letter No. Ext. 2881/194^, dated 1st August, 1942. the auestion of compensation for possible loss or damage to their property at Bahrain by enemy action or by the action of our own military forces (including, of course, '’scorched earth' 1 destruction ordered by the latter). This has led us to consider these questions in relation to the Arab Shaikh- doms of the Persian Gulf generally. It seems to us, how ever, that for the time being we need take into account Bahrain and Kuwait only; that is to say, we do not think we need at present consider either the small shaikhdomson the Trueial coast or the Sultanate of Fuscat, which has a different status from the others. 2. As you doubtless know, Bahrain and Kuwait are British protected States in special treaty relations with H.MG., in consequence of which their foreign affairs are controlled by the latter. x hey are both regarded as bel ligerents in the present war. Their rulers have repeatedly expressed their loyalty to the British connection and to our cause; and they have placed considerable facilities at the disposal of our Forces, especially the Navy and the R.A.E. 3. The political control which, by virtue of her treaty rights, H.M.G. exercises over these shaikhdoms, is in practice exercised by the Government of India. Mili tarily, however, they lie within the sphere, not of the Commander-in-Chief India, but of the Commander-in-Chief Middle East, and it is the latter therefore who is respon sible for their defence. We think that this is a factor of cardinal importance in the present connection; since the military authorities on the spot who might cause damage to be inflicted on property or issue orders for destructive measures would be the agents of a military command over which the Government of India has no control. Hence it seems to us that the question of compensation for any such damage, whether due to military operations or to the insti tution of a ’’scorched earth’’ policy is one for consideration^- by H.M.G. rather than the Government of India. 4. The most valuable privately owned property in these shaikhdoms undoubtedly consists of the installations of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (no oil has yet been won in Kuwait, and the Oil Company there is about to plug its wells and suspend its operations for the duration). The Bahrain Company, though owned and controled by Americans, is technically British; and there is no doubt but that in present circumstances its operations are of very great value to the United Nations. As you are probably aware it is now discussing with the Petroleum Department and the Tar Office a programme of denial measures in regard to the actual oil wells themselves. 5. At present no scheme of war damage compensation or insurance is in force in either Bahrain or Kuwait. Even if such a scheme were introduced in, or extended to, these shaikhdoms, it could not of course cover the whole field: ’’scorching f ’, seizure and other risks incidental to invasion would of necessity be omitted. j.

In continuation of n$r D.O.N 0.86 dated 31.12.42 I have an uncomfortable feeling that you possibly wrote your D/0 No.C/ 1115 of 30 . 12 . 42 , under the impression that I had 'short circuited” you somewhere, or had been seeing and discussing things with H.H. which I should not have done and unbeknown to you. Any way for ir\y own peace of mind and in order to remove any possible misunderstanding or suspicion that may be working in your mind, I am writing to give you an account of ny stewardship for the month of December in as far as this concerned visits to H.H. as below:- (a) (b) I have actually seen the Shaikh 5 times during December On 6.12.42 I called on H.H. at Dasman after you had phoned ms on 3 . 12.42 and told me to tell him of the desperate plight of 5 Badawin tents which I found near tf.&lt;* r .13 on a ire cent visit and whose inhabitants had had no water to drink for 4 days due to wind failing to turn the windmill pump. On 13.12.42. I dropped into H.H's Town Mijliss and saw him for a few minutes to ask after his health. (c) On 16.12.42 I saw H.H. in his evening Mijliss at Dasman for 3 minutes to tell him that Duncan had kindly brought a message from Brigadier Gifford-Hull to effect that he agreed to dump Bitumen in Army trucks at Dasman for eventual i us^^ ~ Y of roadways by K.O.C. (d) On 18.12.42. I saw H.H.at the 'Id” official call in coinpany with Wardrop, Matheson and Head. (e) On 30.12.42 I saw H.H. in morning Mijliss in Town and had a cup of coffee with him. At the (a) interview above I spent about half an hour with H.H. and reported the following routine matters, after mentioning the thirsty Badu incident. (i) That last and 8th barge would leave Shuwaikh about 12th Dec. (ii) That Chase would go for good on 12th Dec. (iii) That Keith had arrived on the previous day to check stores.

In conclusion I should like to assure you that as an ex Political Agent, and one who knows the mary burdens of that Office, you can rely on me never to intentionally 'tread on your toes', or 'short circuit' you in any way. On the contrary by every means in my power I do and shall continue to do ; all I can by way of maintaining the P.A's prestige etc. in this Town. Yours sincerely.

I suggest that you nake it clear to H.H, verbally when next you see him, that if he cannot control the minor Shaikhs the Company cannot continue to maintain these wells in working order. Presumably the natur is a Company employee and can he dismissed by you? He certainly deserves to be. If T can be of any assistance please let me know.. Many thanks for your letter and the enclosure. Yours sincerely, 3d. T. Hickinbotham.5003 Mr.Abdullft Mulla Saleh, H.H'a Official Represent at ire with K.O.C.Ltd., KUWAIT. ^&gt;ear Sir, Stoppage of Water Well No.13. I beg to report the following for the information of His Highness the Shaikh. Yesterday (Saturday 2nd January) being the second day of the New Year and a holiday, I went out for a morning's hawking in the Shaqq accompanied by Saud bin NImran, H.H's Chief Hawker. At 1 P.M. I arrived W.W.13, which I had hoped to find working satisfactorily. Instead I found that the water well pump had completely broken down, although there was a high wind blowing and the wind mill was going round fast. I asked the Natur when the pump had failed and he replied that it had ceased functioning on Thursday 31 at December about Noon. 1 asked if he had immediately informed H.H.The Shaikh, as it was his duty to do, and he replied No, as he had neither oamel or horse to do so but that he had told Salim al Muzaiyin, my servant, who was camped 10 miles away on the evening of Friday 1st .January. That Salim al Muzaiyin had agreed to send a nan on the only donkey he had, to Jahara with orders to inform His Highness the Shaikh of the state of affairs from there. Salim had no oamels as these had not yet arrived back from the North. I do not think that Salim's man could have reached Jahara till this moming(3*1 •43) When I asked the Natur, why there was no water in the Reserve 2000 gallon tank, he replied that Shaikh Sabah al Nasir's man Chudaiyir, had on Friday come with several hundred oamels and drunk up all the reserve water, inspite of his (the Natur*s) vigorous protests. The Natur added that when he asked Chudaiyir to leave a little water for the inhabitants of some 30 tents, scattered round at varying distances from the well, the owners of which were all dependent on W.W.13, Ghudaiyir had laughed, refused his request and drove him away. The Natur said that later Subah al Nasir himself arrived in a oar (Friday evening), and approved the action of his man Chudaiyir. Having taken the Natur* s report as above I proceeded to Salim al Muzaiyin's tent at Umal Chathathi£s (10 miles away) and was told that Sabah al Nasir came there on Friday afternoon and had taken away two of their four 'Jirbas' of water, as he wanted it for his oar.- 2 - While the action of Shaikh Sabah &amp;1 Nasir mat obviously be left for His Highness to deal with, it seems to me that the Natur was to blame under two counts: - (a) He failed to send kn and inform H.H.immediately when the well had broken down. (b) He took no trouble to s.top the wind mill revolving at harmful speed after the pump had oeased working. As regards (a) The Natur admitted that he had some camels but that he had sent them away to the Batin. As regards (b) He said that no one had told hira how to stop the wind mill, which was untrue, as I myself had personally instructed him in this matter. Had not I arrived accidentally on the spot and seen the state of affairs, it is obvious that His Highness would not have received any report from the Natur. 9 As it is I would like you to inform High Highness that I have already taken steps to send out a repair party as soon as possible, but owing to a combination of circumstances the Company's expert fitter, Mohamed Bux, will be unable to start out till Tuesday morning early. This will mean a delay of nearly seven days. To avoid unnecessary suffering to the vaidous Badawin in the vicinity, I am arranging for the relief party to take out 250 gallons of drinking water for distribution. With ny respectful salutations to His Highness, I I remain. Yours faithfully.5014* 9th January 1943 Mr*Ab&lt;iilla Mulla Jaloh, H.H.The Shaikh*s Official Repreaentative with K.O.C.Ltd. • car Sir, ia&amp;d?.-.

I promised to convey the nos sage. ^ (b) Some 100 tents of the Al Ghaszi tribe of the Muntal arrived in the Urn al Cbathathin area 10jaUes north east of B,w.13 and tiave started drinking from the well.

Dear Sir, - Further to my oonweraation with you on Saturday last (13*2.43)# I write to inform you for His Highness* information that on Friday 12-2-43 , I risited W.W.16 and W.W.13 on routine inspection, and have to report as follows:- ( a )« W. W. 16. The water well was working satisfactorily and both Reserve Tank and Water Trough were full. His Highness* 'caretaker*, SA.UD bin S 0 HIASH, was absent, but a woman member of his family appeared to be doing his work satisfactorily. There were some 25 Tents on the well (Ajman, HARB, SHAMMAR-.). Some Sharaifat tribesmen nearby complained that they were not allowed to fill their water skins. So I arranged matters for them: The family of the 'caretaker' asked that 'Saud bin Seh^lash', be instructed to send them out food, as they were rinning short. I under stand that the Said SAUD is bunting with His Highness. W. W. 13. This water well was not working and I found onlylj feet of water^in the Reserve Tank. On examination I found the wire stay controlling the tail of the winomill was broken, and the windmill was running dangerously fast. I also found that the main steel pumping rod, some 10* below the actual windmill, had oome apart at the topmost join, where two rods are screwed together, thus rendering the pump quite useless. In ny opinion the wire stay had been broken by some person or persons who were attempting to stop the windmill and had overwound the hand winch. The break according to local Badawin tookm Page 2 took place on 11th February• His Highness* **caretaker** JAMAAN was not to be found at all ahd a local fekitairi one Saafag bin Turn reported that he had left some days previously for the south. This man Sa'afag stated that he had taken up his abode in the caretakers tent out of friendship for Jamaan, but could not stay there without receiving pay. He requested me to inform H. H. of the situation. For His Highness* information I sent out Mohammed Bux with a full repair party to W W, 13 this morning at 6 A,M, (15-2-43). I suggest that in the absenoe of His Highness that Saud Nimran be informed of the desertion of the 'Caretaker* and the situation generally. To relieve the immediate needs of the local Badawin, I sent 80 gallons of water out by Mohammed Bux. Yours faithfully AG. GEN: SUFDT. KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMITED.Form 7510 C.(9.40.)

Will you please refer to paragraph 3 of ny letter ** of October 13th Mo.Ext*5035/42 (your reference No.S.497 64 of September 15th), in which 1 told you that we were asking the Sovermrent of India whether they agreed that the Bahrain Petroleum Company, (and, if necessary, the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait) might be informed that the question of compensation for war damage (including damage inflicted as the result of orders given by our military authorities) must be left for consiaeration after the war. This enquiry was necessitated by the Treasury’s refusal x to agree that Bahrain and Kuwait should be regarded as covered by l'* the statement, of post-war intentions set out in Byers* letter to Creasy of April 7th** [l 2° The Government of India have now replied that in view j .. (a) the treaty po&amp;ition (whereby H.M.G. controls the foreign relations of the two Shaikhdoms), (b) the value derived by the Empire from their actual and potential oil resources, (c) the free use made of Bahrain and Kuwait territory by British Naval, Military and Air Eorces, and (d) the loyalty displayed by r both Shaikhdoms throughout the course of the war, they regard it as an unavoidable obligation to achieve for these Shaikhdoms the position reached in respect of war damage in the Colonial Empire, Burma and Nev^foundland. 3. At the same time the that it is impossible for them Government of to accept the India state plainly financial responsibilit which such a commitment mi^ht involve, in support of this they point to the fact (to which 1 drew attention in paragraph 3 of my letter to Syers No.Ext.2881/42 of July 28th last) that war damage, including •♦scorched earth* destruction, is at least as likely to be caused under the orders of British Military' Commanders as by- enemy action, and the Government of India have no control over the military authorities concerned and are unable to influence their activities. (Here Mr. Amery r would like me to emphasise that measures to prevent the oil from falling into enemy hands would -not be taken in the interests of the Government of India, but in the general interest of winning the war). The Government of India point to the further fact that H.HT.G. retain control in regard to all matters of high policy in the Arab Shaikhdoms and are the final arbiters in all major questions arising therefrom. (I should explain in this connection that the first sentence of paragraph 3 / of my letter to Syere quoted auove was intended simply’ to describe ^ the immediate administrative control which is exercised by the G.H.M. Wilcox, Esq., H.M. Treasury, London, S.W.l. / ** not received- 2 - the Political authorities v;ho are officers of the Governrrent of India). The Government of India conclude that since hoth political and military control thus rest with H.W.G. it is clear that financial responsibility in a matter of this nature should lie with H.M.G.; and they trust that this position will be accepted. 4* The Viceroy, who is taking a personal interest in this question, has telegraphed to our Secretary of State stressing the necessity of establishing the position of the two Shaikhdome with regard to compensation for war damage on the same basis as the territories already covered by the formula mentioned above. Fe emphasises that a situation in which Bahrain and Kuwait, which constitute an oil supply of inestimable value from the point of view of the war and at a reserve (a supply which would be still more important were the Germans to reach Abadan, ) should be required (a) on our advice to join the Allies and to make available to the Allies their oil production etc.; (b) to face the risk of the destruction of an industry of the highest value because they have co-operated with the Allies; ana (c) to be informed that, they can receive no compensation because H.M.G. under whose instructions and in accordance with whose policy that industry has been destroyed can accept no liabil needs only to be stated for its political (to say nothing of its moral) impossibility to be seen. in his opinion, to treat the Shaikhdoms in this manner would be wholly indefensible, ana he would expect the most damaging use to be made of such treatment not only by the Axis but also by our critics in India, He thinks that it may be assumed that the very substantial American oil interests concerned would also make themselves felt. 5o The Secretary of State desires to support most strongly the views expressed by the Viceroy and the Government of India, and he hopes that the Treasury will now be able to agree that the two Shaikhdome may be officially regarded as covered by the statement of H.M.G ,*3 intentions with regard to compensation for war damage. 6 4 I am sending a copy of this letter to Creasy, Johnston and Berthoud. iours sincerely, (Sgd.)

You remember I mentioned some days ago that G.A.S.O.G. were boring for oil at the site mentioned. (a) The drilling camp which used to be at A3Q AI Q 40 miles 3.&lt;v. oi Dhaharan (3 oil wells) was recently closed down, and the entire camp and staff moved from there to Abraq al Kabrit. (b) The new camp consists of 11 Americans and 147 workmen and guards. (c) The Americans are housed in huts mounted on wheels which are parked in tyro parallel lines close together, the intermediate space being covered over so as to form a dark bazaar looking corridor with wash houses etc. at one end. (d) The camp has electric light and is air conditioned as far as American bungalows and feeding quarters are concerned. (e) A Rig has been erected immediately east of Abraq al Kabrit hill, and boring for oil lias been going on for some time past. (f) Good drinking water for all workmen and guards is obtained from a water well sunk at a comparatively short distance west of drilling site. This water is said to be in sufficient quantity to supply the rig with all its requirements also. The water well is approximately 700 ft deep and is pumped up and on to two tanks located on top of Abraq al Kabrit hill from where it is distributed by gravity. Europeans staff’s drinking water is either distilled locally or brought from a distance, possibly from near Abu Hadriyeh (informant not clear on this point). (g) Before finding the present water supply, another water well was sunk close to Abraq al Kabrit but odorous and brackish water only was found.

I decided that I would not get a satisfactory reply from any one except Sir Yilliam Eraser so asked for an early appointment. A meeting was arranged through the Secretary of the Company. I laid your position and its indefinite status as nothing had been proposed that would give relief to you in the much altered conditions prevailing from Your Highness' point of view before Sir Tilliam Eraser. T found that he was most anxious to help but stated that 'he would much like my views as to how I proposed Your Highness should he relieved of financial worries due to unforeseen difficulties and delays.' I replied that the Company would have to take the responsihility as it was the concern of the Company and it was also the Company's concern that every care he taken that undue delay did not occur - between declara tion of peace and resumption of development work on the concess ion area. The 1946 agreement payments would have to he increased hy at least 2 additional payments and more if delays occurred now unforeseen. ^ir Tilliam then asked if it would be neces-ary to send a Director to Kuwait to discuss with Your Highness all these questions we have been discussing and nake satisfactory arrange ments for the future. I replied that if 3 ir Tilliam was theDirector chosen to visit you then the ihea Ox visiting Duv*it is excellent. Sir Tilliani agreeh that he vould visit Your Highness as T have already cabled to yoi. To sum up the result of my talks with Sir ITilliam Yraser and Yr.

The conversation then became general and one remark made by 3ir Tilliam at lunch alter the msetin 0 was as follows: 'Of all the Companies with which I am connected the treatment that the Kuwait Oil company has received from His Highness the Huler of Kuwait has been the most pleasant, and without trouble. You may convey to His Highness that we Directors much appreciate the great kindness and consideration we have at all times received from His Highness'. I am sure that this goodwill and deep regard tor the nerson of Your TT ighness that 3ir Tilliam and the Directors have expressed is truly genuine.

He is understood to have lunched with H.M's Political Agent and left for Iraq afterwards. Major Doweon inforaed us that he visited Water Well No.15 at , 4 . ThilWan Masaid on Ms way here, on information, from certain Shamatr tribesmen oazvped near Al Auja that Shaildi Sabaih al Nasir had seised the well, driven away H.H's guards and was preventing the Badawin frome* drinking. He ^ranted to test the truth of the story. j| Major Dow son also inforasd us that the Reserve Tank and Prinking Trough (^arru) at ^ater Well were both full and overflowing all over the area in the vicinity of the well, and that no one seemed to care what happened or be exercising any control whatsoever. Major Dowson confirmed also that he found three armed men preventing any one drinking from the well (obviously Sabah al Nasir's men) and he asked the®) why they did not stop the windmill which was revolving dangerously fast, and causing the Derrick to vibrate badly. Two men replied that they had no orders, while the third maid that Ool• Dickson had instructed that it should not be stopped - an obvious falsehood. Major Dowson volunteered the view that already the frame of the derrick half way up had received damage and might collapse as &amp; result. I think His Highness will agree that it is highly undesirable that the above state of affairs be allowed to continue, and it is a matter of great regret to us, that a British Officer fro* Iraq should have noticed the unfortunate state of affairs and thought fit to pass it on to us. We would earnestly advise His Highness to take steps to restore his authority at W.W. 1 ^ by ordering the well caretaker to return to his post with his men and by insisting that Shaikh Sabah al Nasir does not interfere in any way whatsoever with the carrying out of the man'sduties, or better still leave the area These duties as His Highness is aware, consist of (a) Guarding the well and preventing interference by anyone, v b Stopping the windmill if there is a 'high” wind. (c) Attending to the greasing and oiling of the puop shaft and working parts. (d) Reporting to His Highness and the Company immediately &gt;vhen &lt;ny thing goes wrong. We would respectfully remind His Highness that the Company has undertaken to do its best to keep the three water wells set up by the Company in Kuwait State, in proper working order and repair, but if H.H* a official caretakers are allowed to be driven away by any one desiring to seise the water, or if they are permitted to desert their posts at will, and disappear deep into the desert, leaving behind only an unarmed single shepherd, as has recently happened in the case of Hhaiy&amp;h &amp;L Mutairi and Alush al A§€«i (caretakers respectively of Water Wells No. 13 and 4 ) then it will be-ooiae obviously impossible for the Company to assume any sort of responsibility. Hie Highness has no doubt been made fully aware of how during his ret ent absence on a hunting expedition, the writer himself on 13 - 12-43 visited W.W .13 and found to his surprise that certain HASHAIQ&amp; elements following the lead given them by Sabah al Nasir had also taken full possession of the Company's well theze and that the shepherd left in charge openly admitted tnat he was afraid to interfere with them or exert any control whatsoever lest he be attacked and beaten, that the writer niaself was threatened by two R&amp;shaida tribesmen who had seised and were guarding the well, because he gave permission to two travellers to fill their water skins, has without doubt been fully made known to Jrus Highness. It is naturally not the Company's practice to conoem itself in matters affecting His Highness' administration, but we feel strongly that unless His Highness maintains properly armed caretakers on the water wells, situate so far out in the desert, both to control undevir&amp;ble strangers and act as a protection to Company servants who may have to go out and repair the wells, than a difficult situation will arise which may well end in the wells being closed down, a matter far from the wishes of the writer. We trust that these points will be carefully explained to His Highness, for we are his sinoere well wishers in this matter. Tours faithfully. FOR KUWAIT OIL COMPANX,LIMITED.Form 7SI0.

I now enclose for your information copy of Mr. Abdulla Mulla's repiy dated 6 th January 1944, received on 8 th instant. While Mr. Abdulla Mulla's letter might, I think, have been worded a lit ole more tactfully, which makes me think that the contents were not exactly as His nighness intended should be written, but emanated argely i.rom Mr. Abdulla Mulla 1 s own brain, I propose making one or two observations as below: . Par ^- S 1 and 2 of Mr. Abdulla Mulla's letter : The matter is not a trivial' one, as he suggests but on the contrary involves a rather serious bargain between the Con^any and His Highness. The position is as follows: when the first Water Well No.13 was finished and wind mill pump, 3000 gallon reserve water tank, and drinking trough were constructed, bcott and I went and saw His Highness with a view to handing over the whoie thing in working order to him. Scott stipulated that His Highness should maintain a proper caretaker on the well, and the Con^any for its part mmld ' do its best' to maintain the said well in proper running order. Lis 'ighness agreed and the well was handed over, the sane formality being gone through when W.W.No.15 and W.W.N 0.4 were completed by n\yself. 9 H.L. has f\.ept to his bargain during the summer months, when the respective caretakers have made a practice of camping on the wells with strong detachments of guards etc., accommodated in anything upto 23 tents. Each year, however, when the first rains have fallen in the desert ^about end October), the caretakers have moved off into the desert with t eir families, and have left the wells in charge of a single unarmed Badawin shepherd, who has been quite unable to control the crowds of wild nomads coming in to water sheep and camels, with the result that the latter have on several occasions tampered with the working parts oi the windmill and damaged w same ■ * ■ w not to mention water tanks and troughs. The Company for its part has not failed to maintain the wells in working order until the caretakers have returned to their charges m May each year, but one's difficulties have increased as time, hasl£ne on.2 k Several protests have been made to His Highness about the lack of control in the winter and spring of 1942 and 1943 , but nothing seriously wrong has occurred to bring things to a head till the autumn of 1943, when Shaikh Sabah al Nasir (apparently without H.H's authority) seized Water Well No* 15 and drove away the permanent custodian, as well as the shepherd whom the latter tried to leave behind in nominal control. This was followed by similar direct action in the case of W.W.13, the culprits being the Rashaida tribe (see ny letter No*5656 23rd December to Mr. Abdulla Mulla). The situation today (10-1-44-) is that while the proper caretakers haye left their charges, the single unarmed custodians who are supposed to look after the wells (when not in Kuwait endeavouring to buy rations a 10 days job^&amp;H) least these days) are camped near the wells but are not allowed to interfere with them in any way. The matter is really a simple commonsense problem and is one of give and take. We for our part are quite reacty to do our best to keep the 3 water wells in repair and running order, provided His Highness for his part takes reasonable care of them and does not allow interference by irresponsible persons. It means in fact keeping peraanent guards on the wells summer and winter. His Highness apparently is averse to this course probably because of the expense involved. Para 3 of Mr. Abdulla Mulla’s letter appears irrelevant as before he wrote his letter under consideration, I ha^v^iftMlly told him of the clerical error? contained in ny letter, and that for W.W.13 he should readNo.15*( Confirmed by letter 5011 dated 6-1- 44 .) &gt;. Para 4 of Mr. Abdulla Mulla* s letter; I need only mention as examples of how lightly the shepherd caretakers take their duties; that (a) I saw the shepherd in charge of W.W.15 in the bazaar on 7-1-44. He said he had come to get rations and would return in 10 days. He mentioned that he still was forbidden to go near the water well by Shaikh Sabah al Nasir’s men, nor was he allowed to touch the mechanism. (b) I met the shepherd caretaker of W.W.13 on 8 - 1-44 in Kuwait bazaar. He said he also had come to get rations, that he had been away 4 days from his post and before going back proposed to take his family to the Neutral Zone. That he would probably be back in 20 days on the well. Para 5 of Mr. Abdulla Mulla 1 s letter; The Badawin referred to was arrested and brought in by the G-ovemor of the Town on 7-1-44 and I wasf 3 Governor, I said no, aind in fact pleaded for a light sentence of a kind that would act as a deterrent to others.

Dear Sirs, \o I have to refer to your letter No .5656 dated the 23rd December last, a translation of which was submitted to His Highness the Ruler for perusal, and to inform you that His Highness was very mch annoyed at the long report made by you over a trifling matter. I am directed by His Highness to enquire from you whether the Wind Mills are under the control of His Highness or the Company. If they are under the Company then His Highness will not interfere with them and consequently withdraw the caretakers, and the Company is at liberty to do whatever it likes. 2. You will remember that these Wind Mills were given to His Highness by the Company for the use of His Highness and his tribesmen with Ahe promise that the Company would repair any damage whenever found necessary. 3* With regard to your report that Well No. 13 was found overflowing. His Highness told me that when he was out for shooting in the last week of December, he sent his vanette to get water from Well No.13 but his men could not find any water in it. It, therefore, appears that the report you received about it is inaccurate. 4. As regards the absence of the caretakers during the visit of Major Dowson, I have been informed that they came to Kuwait town to take their ration and immediately returned to their post. 5. His Highness regretted veiy much when he came to know that the Acting General Superintendent was threatened by one ignorant Bedou during his visit to Well No.13 on 13-12-43* The Bedou has been beaten and arrested for his bad behaviour. His Highness believes that the Acting General Superintendent knows fully well about Bedouens* custom and behaviour, and suggests that if any of the Company’s staff makes tour to the desert, he should take with him guards to help him in the time of necessity. Yours faithfully, (SGD) ABDULLA MULLA SALEH. P.S. I have just received your letter No.5011 of date and noted the contents you mentioned therein.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000fd_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/250</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000fd</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/250</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 5/1 XV Kuwait Oil Company'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-17T16:01:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (256 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 258; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Additonal foliation sequences are present in parallel between ff 37-257; these numbers are also written in pencil but, where circled, are crossed through.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains documentation and correspondence relating to the Kuwait Oil Company's operations in Kuwait.
