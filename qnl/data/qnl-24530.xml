Also discussed is Phayre's decision to censure Captain Harrison, which Merewether wishes to be removed, and a reminder of the policy in regards to Khelat which was laid down by the Government of India in July 1869.The letter also responds to Colonel Phayre's comments in relation to Captain Sandeman's actions, stating that he views these actions has much serious than the Colonel has and also stating that he does not see the interpretation which the Colonel has attempted to apply to correspondence from the Khan, who was well within his rights to complain about British officers communicating with his Chiefs.The letter concludes by discussing complaints made by His Highness the Khan of Khelat and attempting to correct Colonel Phayre's 'misconceptions' of the situation before instructing the Colonel to strictly adhere to the orders laid down in Merewether's letters and to ensure that all Captain Sandeman's dealings with the Murree and Boogtee tribes go through himself (Phayre), excepting where they relate to those members of the tribes in Government employ.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00000d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
