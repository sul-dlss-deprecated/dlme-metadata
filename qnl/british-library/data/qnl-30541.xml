There was a great rejoicing in the town on the 6 th January, when the fishermen hauled up 5600 pieces of fish called ‘KIR* and drought it in coats to Jwadur. The fish was sold for s.26062/-. The fish industry in Owadur is however being greatly exploited bv the merchants - they advance loans to the fishermen anu buy the catch at very cheap rates. There seems to be a great scope of intruducing reforms in the fish industry in this' place. The following telegram which has been sent by fcessrs Lalchand at Karachi to Haj'i BacKer at Owadur is however not very encouraging:- ' 'Tried much aosolutely no hope transhipment aoout thirty thousanu accumulated here Malabar heavily rushiag Oeylonees introduced fish industry getting fresh fish vast quantities it appears now no much necessity of Kexran fish ' 22. S.S. Oradell called at G-wadur on the 7th January .am left for Karachi on the 6 th January. About 6 M tons of fish was 'shipped to Karachi by this btearner. The ^existing rate of steamer freight from Bwadur to Karachi viz 3.19/- per ton is considered very high. The prewar rate used to be aoout half of ana as the .^ereahn merchants cannot get steamer connections for Coiomoo at Karachi, some of them are quite prepared to send their fish to Karachi by country crafts’, which is much cheaper than steamers. The oig merphants are however quite content to pay more by steamers' with a view to attract steamer service being resumed in GJwadur. 26. Nasir Ali, Kali of Peshkan, is still in Gwaour - vide, para 15 of previous• diary. He came to Gwadur to settle a dispute with his younger brother - Abdul Latif - who is eal claiming a share in the property inherited by ‘Nasir Ali after the death of their father. Kauda i\iabibux and Qazi bad Moha have/ decided that Nasir Ali should pay the following to Abdul Latif:- 1. Gash ... ... s. 500/- * 2. One gun with ammunition , 6 . Share of arable landjsaltpans at Peshkan, 4. Nasir Ali should remit avloan of 3.600/- against Abdul Latif. 24. Nasir Ali called on me again yesterday ana said that he was not prepared to accept the decision of Kauaa Nabi bux. He hinted whether I would settle this dispute, I totally refused to interfere and he appreciated that it was hot my job. He'said that he was quit,e prepared to pay 3.600/- or 400/ - to Abdul Latif which represents proportionate .share of Abaul Latif on account of -one house in reshxan and another one in Gwadur.at present under the charge of Nasir Ali. Nasir iui denies having inherited any other property from his father. He .said that he had fettled hiselder brother by paying him m.2DO/- only. He has still another*younger brother- called Ali- who is at present in Karachi, out when he came babk to Gwadur, he would also eali claim his share on the lines of Abuul Latif anu he was unable to pay. I asxed him what would be the consequences if he did not carry out the decision of Kauaa Nabi Bux ana the Qazi. He saiu that ho would wait here for a few days out if they do not decide in his favour he would go back to Pesnxan. 25. The Wall met me on the 8 th January. He was labouring under a delusion that the geologists had said something about the possibility of an oil existing in the new island in West Bay. I told him that the geolpgists did not mention anything to me about this matter, ana that if was improbable’that they said anything about oil etc to any individual; the 1 effects of.the earthquake shocks in ftd y^&lt;r^^yy / U C U/ 3 y had just come to see the Mejcran coast, ^ The V/ali has been suffering from malaria for the last few days ana I gave him some aspirin ana quinine pills. 26.^ One locust trucK irriveU from Turbat on the 9th January ao j-vrauur.

Not a pie was presumaoly spent out of this large income by the* Muscat Jtate in Gwadur excex^t a on the pay of a few petty officials. The Amin of Customs callW the merchants in Gwadur as oig rascals. r °aia the merchants call him a rascal too. his ’wife is lingering on ana nothing can be said about the eventual recovery. Ly wife is however visiting her from time to time anuwe are giving her all possible assistance. 28. Reference para 20 of last summary. The Llumhi of the mhowja community anu his wife reachea at ivarachi, safely by H.I.L’.o. 'Hinaustan' oh the 8 th January 1945. They sent the following telegram to me:- / ' Arrived safely respectfully express our thanks for your and Mrs Hidayatullah T s valuable services renuered auring our illness' Bandalli and Mrs dandalli. 29. Mir Ilolaad - father of nadmohu - who was lately murdered at Cunster by Hayatoon caine to Gwaaur with his son anu a fe\y comraues. It is statea that he had hearu that Hayatoon was taKing- hiaing hir^self in Nigore (Gwadur area), but when the party could not find him there they came to Gwadur in search of him. In Gwadur they trieu to buy guns ana ammunition ana left the place after a few pays sojourn, oemanuar Sabzal, who is a prominent landlora in Nigore cjme to see me dm the 10th January. He confirmed that Hayatoon had been reported to iiave been in nigore for 3 aays recently, but he coulu npt be traced by the hunters. The ’hoots’ it is reporteu, have uiviuea themselves into 3 parties anu are chasing Hayatoon, who is not expected to remain at large for a long time. 30. A caravan of 6 Persian Baluchis came to Cwadur from Iranshahr with doriAeys a few days ago. They brought about 15000/- tomans with them ana on arrival at Gwaaur were orferred 0/10/9 per toman*. They v/^mted to buy cloth, ana as Gwaaur ana rasni seem to be the centres for smuggling into Persia, I have nodoubt that they were able to buy some cloth locally. I however warned the Amin of Customs aho passed on the message to the Hali, but the cloth must have reached Persia safely by now. 31. One more batch of about 15 Hindus came to Gwadur from Pasni on the 11th January. They resorted that there have been many more shocks at Pasni, About 14 Hindus have however shifted to Jiwani and it is expected that yet another group of about 15 Hindus may migrate from Pasni to Gwadur in a few days time. They all have olu commercial associations in Gwadur. According to them, the Congress anu Government have both provided liberal relief at Pasni ? e.g. free rations ana tents etc. It would appear from the following article/ which appeared in the Civil ana' Military Gazette issue dated 15th December 1945 that the Congress is collecting more funus for relief work in Uekran coast:- 'Calcutta. Dec.13.

I understand he had a brisk trade oi passengers pid maue a handsome profit, but my '’sympathisers’* 'have^ warned me that I should be careful of earning a bad name, as the passengers may think that the British Agent taxes his share from i^aucla AdUibl Rasool. My experience is that it is difficult for me to verjiy the bona fides of the applicants, and tnat the ^ertiiicates^oi laentily issued are more a source of revenue to the Agency than a control on the passengers. It is also true., perhaps, tnat mearly all the applicants harmless coolies etc. xxxxxxxxx**** No: ‘jU * British Agency, Gwadur, 12th January,1946.

It is stateci the Nanhuaas anu crew of these boats went from / Giclani to Karaclii anu telegraphed to the owners of the boats in Cfwauur explaining the position. The \7ali # of'Gwauur thereupon telegraphed to tne State authorities asking for the release of the * .boats in question and 3 of them were accordingly set free immediately. Onepboat still remained at Gidani imu a few days ago, the /ali again wired to the /azir, Las Sella, threatening that unless the last boat was released he would detain all Gidani boats etc arm which may c 9 .ll at Gwauur'in future. The State authorities, it is understood, have consequently released the last ooat also, which belongs to Itehuda Hudoox I uitah. These boats are alleged to liave been^engftged in smuggling durin 0 the whole period of far. I have received certain repoKs from British subjects that they had' advanced 'money to various Nakhuaas (Abdul Rasool Behram being one of them) to oring stuff for them from India, out they are now unaole to get back tne money or goods. 06 . /ith effect from the 15th January 1946, bahoor Aimaid - viue para 9 of my bunmary for the period 16 th to 3ist wecemoer,l9no- ; started a daily newspaper in Urdu m Gfv/adur. The newspaper is called 'Jud-o-Jeha’*. he is assisted by certain Nabi Bux, who is an employee I iof Lessrs nehmtula Bashirbhoy Band all. The newspaper is written in ink or pencil by the editor and carjxm copies are made anu sold to the public anna one per copy. The total circulation is about 12 copies per day. The Amm of Customs is very apprehensive that this newspaper would sow the seeds of friction between the Baluchis ana Khowja community and that as it had not been sanctioned by the Government, the '/ali should proscribe it. Recently, the editor has written d few articles in which he has complained that that some mischief mongers are trying to create misunderstanding about their motives between the puolisners anu the Government. At present, it seems, the .Akin etc and the editor are apprehensive of' each otlier. The editor has already severely criticised the appalling ean insanitory conditions in Gwadur and the non existence of a doctor. The other news are extracted from old Indian newspapers ana are reproduced in 'Jud-o-Jeha'. 37. S.S. 'Barala” called at Iwaaur on the 14th January 1946 on way from Karachi to Bahrain. 120 deck passengers were landfix disembarked in a very stormy weather. It is said that the crew of the ship threw some of the luggage of the passengers intO'the sea , out tne local Agent of the X. I. Co.' contradicted this report to me. 38. The telegraph line between Gwaaur ana Karachi became faulty on account of oau weather conditions ana communications were restored on the 19th January, during the interruption the telegrams were’ sent to Karachi via Panjgur. The Postmaster at Gwadur, does not accept mails for steamers as according to him, he has no instructions to ao so. He lias asned for special instructions for accepting Insured fetters containing high denomination notes from his higher authorities out no reply has yet oeen received. I am writing officially on this matter separately, so .that the Postmaster, should accept mails for despatch oy steamers. 39. , loranim Shaffi ana Ibrahim Taj ax who were both involved in the cloth' case returned from Luscac, on the 13th January. The Jfusiim community were.joyful as their frienus had been acquitted of which there was no Rope. . .. \w 4&gt;?. ^ I , - 2 - 40. ' Luscat telegrams regarding x»he currency notes were receiveu on^the 14th w anuary^anu 17tn January 1946 respect!vely anu public notices were issued oy me immediately. There was lot of guess as to the reasons for the action taken oy the Government. It is generally oelievea tiiat the Government of Inaia wish to catch the profiteers etc., ana some people also think tnat there might oe some counterfeit notes in circulation. One Inuian firm exchangea the following 4 notes of 3 . 1000 /- each from the -imin of Customs on the 15th January i946:- 1. \/4 177675 2 . AM 162260 3. A/ 7 533039. 4. V7 80601a These notes came to Gwanur from Karachi by 3.^. 'Barala' on the 14th January j. 946. The Amin of Customs pretended ignorance of the public notice issued oy me. 41. Reference para oO of Intelligence Jummary for the period 1 st to loth January 1946. It is oelievea that ( 1 ) Rewa Ghana ana Phatoomal, Indian merchants, are mostly indulging in smuggling activities ana sold aoout 50 pieces of cloth to the Persian smugglers. The export of cloth is ordinarily prohibited from Gwaaur. However, the cloth is sola to smugglers in short lengths, which is taken out of the town at night time ana aocassionaliy large quantities of cloth are also taken out of the tov/n with the connivance of the local —0 fficiaPs. 42. A certain uur Lohu Je^oy of Idtlat otate was sent to Gwadur on the 17th January 1946 oy tiie Kastaufi of Turbat in oraer to arrest a certain Ramzan bin Juma. The Sepoy was accompanied by his son ana 2 cousins ana were armed with 2 rifles ana 25 rounus of ammunition. They remainea in Gwadur for 2 days ana went away without seeing the guilty person in Gwadur. 43. There was another big eaten of 30000 (Thirty thousand) fish on the 17th January 1946 of 'Gullao' variety, which wa$ sold for 3.9000/-. The fish catch this year has been much better than last year. 44. A certain 3yed Loha Husain, who is a very popular ascetic in these parts arrived at Gwadur by 3.3.'Barala” on the 14th January. He lives m a cave in Gwadur on the foot of the hill about 2 furlongs behind the Y/ali's house in the couth Vest corner of the Zest Jay. I paia a visit to him on the 18th January ana came to know that he hau come to Gwadur^for re supervising rei^airs to the cave whi-ch which had been aaiigeu by the earthquake. He permitted me to visit the whole cave which is uiviaea into 3 chamoers of different sizes. All the rooms are connected by a narrow passage ana are well white washed. The cave was built in 1339 Kijri (i.e. about 25 years ago) by the above-mentioned person. A small white stone with an inscriptior showing thehname of the founder ana the date of construction is fixed on the entrance of the 2nd chamber. One man was killed in the ante chamber on the nigbt of the earthquake when a stone fell from the adjacent hill ana knocked uov/n the roof of the ante chamber. He is treated as a martyr oy the local people. Jyea Loha Husain lias a' very impressive personality anu can compose i ersian v-erses am writes amulets for the Baluchis ana has no scruples to accept small presents. 45. I visited dor and Lori Rek by the locust truck on the 19th January, ana met the British subjects there, who manufacture salt there. In dor area, there is queer fountain of muuuy water. The Amin tola me that aoout 15 years ago Mr. B.3. Thomas, who was a Minister to His highness the Bultan of Muscat visited this spring anu took samples ol the water ana clay arouna it. In Gwadur, everything is attributed to oil ana it is believed that this foutain is also due to oil in this area. The spring ponu has a diameter of about 30 f and the clay around it which is of grey yellowish cohour is consiaerec to contain sulphur. ' - 46. The sky was clouuy on the 19th January ana there were a few drops of rain. The people are anxiously waiting for rains for the winter crops.0 ' - 3 - ' • 4/.

He called on me on the 3rd June and was invited to tea with his 2 sons and Kauda Shadian of Sur who is an ardent Zikri. Mulla Baikhan claimed that he has a following of 40000 (Forty thousand) Zikris who are all scattered in Mekran, Baluchistan and Smd etc. but he lives in Kech where he owns lands and gardens. He was much impressed with my invitation and said that ne enjoyed great respect in official circles in Baluchistan and Mekran and was much grateful to the British Govt. I understand that he had collected donations of Ks 500/- from Sur and Gwadur from his followers who treat him as their spiritual head in this world. In compliance with his request I arranged 10 seers of sugar for him at the control rate from my own share and all his party -2±^T-aftd-all-his-party were exceedingly pleased with me for this gesture of kindness. 213. The sea was very rough on the 4th. 5th and 6th oune 1946, so much so that 2 fishing boais were reported to have sunk on the night of the 5th June with a fish catch worth approximately is 200/-. It is generally believed that the sea is steadily rising in the hast Bay and that it is gradually washing away the sea-shore. Recently some damage has been reported to the houses situated on the sea-front on account of high tidal waves due to stormy sea. 214. un the 5th June 1946, Seth Farsaram Odermal - Mukhi of the Hindu community - reported that the following 3 persons of his comriunity were heavily addicted to gambling, drinking ana prostitution and that they were most undesirable characters among the Hindus in Gwadur:- 1. Walloomal son of Laloomal 2. Bamoomal son of Gianchana 3. Phatoomal son of Lekoomal The Mukhi requested me to reprimand them severely. After making due enquiries, I took bonds of good behaviour from No.l &amp; 2 and for a period of o months and No.3 left for India for good by 3.S.’Barpeta’on the 11th June 1946. 215. 3.3. 'Barpeta' called at Gwadur on the 11th June 1946. She landed 35 passengers from Muscat and picked up 190 from Gwauur for Karachi besides a cargo of 80 tons oi fish. 216. The MLi called on me at my place on the 8th June 1946 accompanied by Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy anu discussed about the Atta situatipn. 100 tons of Atta had arrived at Gwadur early in June but as the invoices are still awaited, it was decided in a meeting held at the Custom House on the 11th June to release 30 tons for sale to the public by the merchants. The provisional price of Atta was fixed at to.30/- per bag of standard weight and 70 tons of Atta hadlbeen kept in reserve pending receipt or invoices from Karachi. 217. The Sultan has directed the Administrator to ascertain terms of deputation of an overseer from the Sind Government for making plans and estimates of proposed new buildings etc. K.B. Abdul Haiy has accordingly wired to the Political Muscat, who is recessing at Karachi to arrange for an overseer. The Administrator expected to fly to Karachi in order to assist the Political Agent in arranging for an early recruitment of staff for Gwadur - in fact - he arranged for an A.I.O.C. truck to come down from Jiwani to pick him up from Gwadur to the aerodrome, but the Sultan advised K.B. Abdul Haiy that instead of going to Karachi he should remind the Political Agent at Karachi to expedite tee recruitment of the proposed staff. The Sultan's reply to the K.B.'s proposal for sinking an artesian well at Gwadur is still awaited, but the K.B. seems to be very anxious to try out this experiment for improving the water supply arrangements at Gwadur.P.T.0.

On the 17th June 1946, the .Vali issued orders at the request of fishermen that small fish should n °t be ?a u $ t \ fr °“ the sea as it was a natural bait frem-the for the big poor men resented these orders but it was arranged that out of each 10 big fishes caught 1 should be sold m the buq at a control rate of annas -/of- per kiatf - one goes to the custom m payment of duty and the remaining 8 could be sold to the fish merchants for export purposes. Tne orders were carried out tor a lew clays, but they are now being observed more in breach. 228. The Wali's cousin - Kohd bin Said - £ et ^ ri ? eci l ^ r ^ on the 11th June 1946 accompanied by his wife by S.S. farpeta . He was invited by me to tea .on the *June 1946 with the tfali. Opportunity was taken to point out to the Jali that the Janm oi Customs, Gwadur, should be told not to issue chits for Targe quantities of Atta in favour of .any individual wmch he had done recently. The Wali promised to inform the Aaim ol Customs, accordingly. 229. Kauda Abdulla called on me in office on the 19th dune. He told me secretly that the Wali had sent Kauda Nabibux to Feshkan with &amp;.1Q00/- as an imprest money to buy for him 100 bags of rice for trade purposes from Jiwani. Kauda Nabibux returned^o Gwactur on the 29th June, but it appears that he was unable to find any rice for the Wall, as he set out too late for the job. It is presumed that the Wali will try to use Kauaa N^bibux again fcr smu^linK etc. I hav* had unconfirmed reports that the Wall has recently sold 6 bags of sugar in the town. Further enquiries are being m^de about it. 220 . Mr. Badar Din and Mr. Amman Ullah, Kxcise Sub-Inspectors ~ 1 J -’-- Jur~ at Turbat and Gunz respectively visited Gwadur on the 19th June 1946, They were probably on duty and wanted to see whether any tobacco was being smuggled into Gwadur from Kalat State. They returned on the 20th JuneI946. 231. A deputation of the \gha Xhanis fish-merchants called on me on the 19th June 1946 and represented that the Customs authorities at Karachi had stopped export of Indian currency to Jiwani and Gwadur am requested that I should arrange 1 or an. kxport Pennit for 3 lakhs of rupees for their immediate requinamunts and &amp;.3 lakhs six monthly thereafter, otherwise their trade would suffer badly. The Political Agent was informed immediately of the situation by telegrams, but meanwhile about rs. 50000/- have been imported into Gwauur from rasni and Jiwani by special meesengers. As soon as the news of shortage of money raafiked spread in the town, the discount rate rose from annas /8/- to &amp;•!/• and 1/4. The shortage of money is partly due to the Amm of Customs reiusing to accept old notes which has stopped circulation of a large nunber of Indian currency notes in the market and which are being, sent back to India for exchange as and when opportunity offers itseli. 232. The Government of India has sanctioned 60 tons of wheat monthly for Gwadur from 1st May 1946. The shippers had been asked to obtain wheat from the Director of Grains Depot, Karachi, but it appears that upto the end of June, he had received no instructions from the Government of India to issue wheat for Gwadur. The matter is under reference to the Political xigency, Muscat. 233. The Anin of Customs, Gwadur, desires that postal parcels which arrive at Gwadur should be sent by the Sub-Postmaster, ^wadur, to his office for examination purposes and assessment of Custom duty, ^s this is considered to be against the postal rules,.the bub- Postmaster referred the matter to his higher authorities. He states that the Amin of Customs should send his representative to the Post Office on mail days for examination of postal parcels etc. rhe DPT Karachi made telegraphic enquires whether Custom duty is leviable at Gwauur on postal parcels and if so procedure for effecting recovery thereof. The matter has been referred by me to the Political Agency, Muscat, and their reply is awaited.(Continued) 3^ x£i4xx Upto now norf regular procedure was being followed. Sometimes the Sub-Postmaster delivered postal parcels to the addressees direct from the Post Office or sometimes on the authority of the iimin of Customs, but the question arose over a doubtful parcel which the Sub-Poster wanted to have examined in hie presence by the Customs authorities, but the Amin of Customs, Gwadur, refused to allow the Postmaster to have the parcel opened by him. 235. I axnd the Administrative Officer called on the Wali on the 28th June 1946. The Wali bitterly complained about the unsuita bility of his house. Ahan Bahadur Abdul haiy had obtained a rough estimate of !^.5Q00/- for repairs required in the Wali*s house from a local mason. The Wali took this estimate from the Administrator and intended to write to the Sultan direct on the subject. 236. A taxi lorry - Chev. model 1943 - 4* tons - belonging to Haji Anir bux, mail contractor - luetta-Aalat line - driver Mohd Tasim - came to Gwadur from Jiwani on the 29th June 1946 and returned on the 3rd June 1946. it brought 8 passengers and took back a similar number from Gwadur - Pare IvS.o/- per passenger, but this ^as a special trip and not part of a regular hr prograrane. 237. S.S. 'Barpeta - is expected from Karachi on the first week of July 1946 after about 5 weeks. 100 passengers are expected to land at Gwadur . 238. There are rumours that in Chahbar distribt the Baloch Gendarmerie officers have been replaced by the Persian Gendarmerie officers and the salaries of the latter have been doubled up - the minimum being Tomans 100/- p.m. 239. The weather has been hot during the later part of July* 1946, but when the northemly breeze springs up in the evenings, it becomes delightful again and upto now one cannot grumble about the heat. The local people say that by \the end of JuIy,±Sfefcfi* the weather always changes in Gwadur and it will become very pleasant. 240. Pish catch and price both excellent.

He said that he wanted (1) a motor car (2) tfater filter and (3) an apparatus for filtering rose water. I explained to him the difficulties and procedure regarding export of motor cars from India, but promised to forward his application to the Political Agent, Muscat, if ana when received. I am however trying to arrange, items 2 ana 3 for him. 242. S.S. n Barpeta' arrived from Karachi on the 3rd July 1946 after sunset. She ineluded landed 72 deck passengers and picked up 16 for Muscat. The sea was very rough ana the passengers were disembarked in baskets some of whom lost most of their gear. Night landing in fowadur is always risky specially in the months of July? June, July and August and the passengers are put to great inconvenience. 243. A meeting of the Control Comnittee was held on the 4th July 1946. The remaining 70 tons of Atta (vide paras 208 and 216 of previous summaries) was released for sale to the public and it*s prices were fixed as follows:- Esr. bgg Ksr mm k m: id. 40/8 Id. 2/12/- id 0/3/0 It was also proposed that if any merchant charged excessive rates, he should be liable to a fine upto Id.50/- ana the articles in question should be confiscatea in each offence. 244. While the meeting referreu to above was going on, an Hast bound aeroplane flew dangerously low over the town, which remained a burning topic of the whole day. 245. In another meeting of the Control Coranittee held on the 6th July 1946, it had been deciaed to introauce Ration Cards in Gwadur which work is well under way. 246. during the period under report, several thefts took place in the town. One British subject named Ibrahim Shaffi lost S.510/- in currency notes on the night of the 6th July 1946. No suspects were disclosed, but the Wali and I have expelled 2 casual visitors who had no ostensible business in Gwadur. The local residents have been night patrolling their streets for some time. . 247. It is being generally felt that gam youngnen and women of cheap virtue are becoming more and more addicted to gambling in Gwadur as they have no other pastime. Although the elderly persons look with horror upon this ugly feature of the youths, the Askaris are making a little money from the gambling centres. 248. The number of street dogs had lately reached to an intolerable pitch and they mostly looked diseased. In certain streets, one could see more dogs than children running about - consequently as a result of discussion between myself. Administrator and the Wali, the unwanted dogs are being killed am their number has been reduced considerably. 249. On ilie 6th July 1946, a certain Piri Gamshad reported that the Wali haa seized his British Passport No:20963 and refused to return it as the Wali considered that Pirigamshad was a Muscat subject and that the Sind Government had issued him with a passport erroneously. His case has been fully reported to the Political Agent in this office letter No.395 dated the §th July 1946* 250. Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy dlhashny, M.B.K., Administrative for Gwadur, has applied for short leave in oeptember 1946 as he intends to bake down his family to India at that time. His wife is in a family way and he fears that there are no medical arrangements available in Gwadur.■■■■■■■ &gt; 3p 251. The annual prize distribution of the Aga.Khanis* School took place on the ilx*h July 1946. as usual they did not invite non Aga Khanis and the prizes were given away by their Acting Mukhi Ahmadbhoy amidst a large gathering of all the members ol their comziunity. 252. Over 6000 packages (i.e. about 300 tons) of dry fish arra have been held up in Gwadur as no steamer has called at here foraMiar since ilth June 1946. One steamer is now being expected from Basra within a fortnight and it is hoped that the whole fish will be transported to Karachi for Colombo. 253. As a partial remedy to the faults in the telegraph line between Karachi ana Owadur, the postal authorities have made, panjgur a transit office. This means that Gwadur.ana Karachi will exchange their messages through Panjgur ana it is hoped that delays in transmission of messages will be greatly reduced. 254. 3.S.'Barala' arrived from Karachi on the 12th July 1946.and landed 350 passengers and 4 bales of cloth. The sea was stormy - the passengers reached ashore at night time and lost much of their baggage. 255. An experimental post office is being established at Jiwani - An account^! the Customs, Jiwani, has been sent to Turbat for training in postal work - let me hope that Gwadur will eventually be linked up with Jiwani for postal services which could be carried by air mail between Jiwani ana Karachi and by ta- mail lorries between Jiwani and Gwadur. It will be a clear step forward to the much desired reforms needed in Gwadur. 256. The following extracts from the Civil and Military. Gazette dated the 18th July 1946 are reproduced below concering the Pe rsian Mekran:- * I * 'London. June 17.- Allegations.that a British 1 plane had made several trips to Persian Baluchistan with amis and ammunitions were made by Moscow Kadio, monitored in London yesterday. Quoting the Iranian newspaper, 'Rahbar'. the radio said that the ’plane lanaed in the Deshtjari area of Baluchistan, picked up several chieftains and took off with them* Several days later, it returned with them and a cargo of armament, /ammunition, cloth, sugar and tea. Subsequently, the ’plane made several more trips. The newspaper reported that measures had been taken to seize armament delivered by the British 'plane ana that the local Iranisui authorities had addressed a note of the matter to Britain.' A.P.A. ’Ill 'London, June 17.- Moscow radio, quoting a Teheran newspaper report, said yesterday that Britain had been flying arms into Persian Baluchistan (near the north-east frontier of India). The report saio. that a month ago a British ’plane landed in Baluchistan, took aboard a number of Baluchi chiefs and flew off. The ’plane returned a few days later ana the chiefs, together with guns, ammunition, tea and sugar. The plane carried out a number of such sorties.' Reuter. 257. No umsli such rumours have reached Gwadur - but in this connection paras 198 and 199 of my previous sunmaries and para 7 of my letter No,S 332 dated the 22nd May 1946 may be of |^ge w |g.^|re8t# as showing the Russian interest in this part of P.T.O. =268* A taxi tonoLcMa lorry No.8045 - Chef - 4 tons belonging to Contractor Mukhi Duramanmal of Bhag which plies on the Turbat-Jiwani route under the charge of driver Dur Mohd came to Gwa^ur from Jiwani on the 14th July 1945 anu brought 12 pilgrims from Turbat. It left for Jiwani on the 15bh with passengers - It appears that the drivers of these taxis come to Gwauur to make an extra call in their own interest ana to fetch petrolj supplies of which are issued to them accoraing to quota in the Kalat otate. No petrol had been issued to driver however, except to enable him to return to Jiwani, although about 400 tins of petrol are lying in stock in the Gfwauur godowns in the charge of the local B.I. Agents. 2599. Many pilgrims are wandering about in Gwadur streets who propose to walk uown to Mecca via Muscat through Qatar penninsual 1 .

Belexenae,|229 of m/ nrevioua ^umna ri^a: Kauda Nabibuuc went to Peehican on the 15th July 1946 and again at the end of this month aa it is understood that nia efforts to bu£ rice for the Wali have since borne fruit ana that about 150 bags have already reached Peshkan from Jiwani. The rice is said t&lt;? have o^en purchased at is.45/- per bag through the Kaudas in Jiwani area plus incidental charges viz fe.20/- per ba^. It has also been reported to me that the Central P.^.D. at Jiwani have also been selling Grovemment rice in their charge which had been sent there for the labourers. The Wall's rice will be sent direct, I believe, to Ctaan or Trucial coast as soon as dhows start plying again ana his transaction is now an open secret in Gwadur. 262. 20 \rab Askaris of Bani Oner tribe including their 'Aqid* struck work on the 16th July 1946. There are only 30 Askaris in Gfwadur i.e. 20 for the 'Suq 1 and 10 for the Fort. The real cause of the strike is not known, but the Wall said that these Askaris had been in Gwadur for over 4 years and were anxious to go back from Gwadur. The State authorities are however not sending new men to replace them. On the 17th July, the'Aqid* compromised with the Wall; the Askaris resumed duty and nothing more nas been heard of their dispute. The Wali intended to write to the Sultan asking him to replace the Askaris in question. 263. There are huge stocks of cotton lying in Gwadur for the last 4/5 years with the Indian merchants on which import duty has not yet been paid^ltham to the Customs authorities. According to the Sttsfe existing ^procedure import duty on Cotton, goat hair, wool and Hides and skins which come from ISekran to Gwadur by the lam route was being paid at the time when these commodities were actually exported from Gwadur. But the new Amin of Customs is thinking hard how best to recover the import duty leviable on the existing stocxs ana in future to charge duty on the above goods immediately on their arrival at Gwadur. He may sooner or later call upon the merchants to declare their stocks to him for an assessment of duty, but it seems impossible that the traders will declare their stocks correctly or that they will appreciate a change in the existing procedure. 264. S.S.'Barjora* arrived at Gwadur from Karachi on the 24th July 1946. She lamed 253 deck passengers and 53 packages of vegetable ghi. Owing to acute shortage of ghi in 'Gwadur, the vegetable ghi is selling at Rs.84/- per tin of 36 lbs. As more than half the animals have been reported dead in Mekran owing to scarcity of fodder, no ghi has been coming into Gwadur for some time and it is reported that it has also been controlled in Llekran. 265. b.S. 'Baznora* arrived at Gwadur from Muscat on the 26th July 1946. She took 338 tons of cargo of dry fish in transit to Colombo am tho freight paid amounted to fts.25000/-. It is understood that S.S. 'Bamora' is being treated as a cargo boat, therefore, no passengers were taken from Gwadur. 266. A taxi lorry No.QTA 7211 - driver Nasir Baloch arrived from Jiwani on the 25th July ana returned on the 27th July 1946 with passengers. The taxi drivers are now carrying out Customs formalities on arrival ani departure at Gwadur. 267. Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy, Administrator for Gwadur, fell ill on the nigbt of the 29th July 1946. As no medical aid is availaole in Gfwadur, he became very nervous and dictated to me his Will at mid-night. He was in bed for 3 days ana carried out treatment of Captain Innis - Medical Officer - Panjgur Agency as suggested by him on the telegraph line. He is still very week ana generally speaking- 2 - A\ © he is feci up with Grwaaur in more than one sense ana has decided to leave this place in Septanber when sea will be calm. 268. Tea ana dry colours, for which no qupta is being sanctioned by the Government of India, has started coming into Gwadur by Postal parcelsjfrom Karachi. The parcels received by the last post were more than the previous one and many more are said to be lying in transit. 269. Mr. Muzzafar - Assistant Locust Warning Officer, Gwadur, celebrated his birthday on the 17th July ana left on tour to Jiwani on the 21st returning on the 25tn July 1946. 270. The Wall has recruited a few Baloch Askaris from Gwadur recently. It is expected that there will be some lull in evil activities during the month of 'Hamzan*. 271. The weather has been extremely pleasant - The fishemen took rest for 3 days at the end of July ana did not go out fishing. This is an annual affair anu in these days they sacrifice goats and offer alms to the poors so that theye may be more fish for them in the sea. 272. Kxisting stocks of Atta have run out completely but fresh supplies are being anxiously awaited from Karachi. Some *Atta is available in the black marxet - but the poor men are eating millet. The existing stocks of rice viz 50 tons will hardly last for another 2 months and after that I suppose the real difficulties will start as 60 tons of wheat can by no means be considered enough for whole of Gwadur.

Mr. Moha Husain - Tehsildar, Jiwani, came to Grwadur on the 2na August 1946 P.M. by a Taxi lorry No:Kalat 294 - driver Khuciadad along with other passengers. His father had been known to Khan bahaaur Abdul Haiy who invited him to stay with him. On the 3rd August, ho dined with me and called on the »/ali on the same evening accompanied by the Administrator and the myself. He confirmed the news referred to in para.2136 of my Suraiaary for the period 1st to 15th July 1946 saying that probably an 0.0. R.A.F. Station, Jiwani, who has since oeen transferred, had once flov/n the younger brother of Sardar Abdi Khan to Jashtiari and that it appeared that the news went to the Russians somehow or other. The Tehsildar returned on the 4th August. 274. # A taxi lorry No.QTA 8407 - driver Grhulam Hohd belonging to Mukhi Dhammamal came to Gwadur on the 3rd August with passengers including one Hindu merchant named - Xhub Chand of Pasni- who / stayed with Messrs Lekoomal Jatwani at Gwadur ana is reported to | have taken away some cases of liquor for Pasni and also some sugar from his host. Seth Lekoomal Jatwani tops the list of cunning persons in Gwadur inspite of the fact that he has a fairly good business in this place. 275. -Je had a few showers of rain in Gwattur on the 6th August 1946, but it is reported that heavy rains fell in Mekran on the same day at Turbat and Pasni etc. The mails arrived from Pasni one day late. The local inhabitants are expecting some more rains - The weather remains cloudy, but there has been no real rain here upto now. 276.

There are many conjectures in the market about this hold-up, but the real reasons are not known, dome say that the hagsman Naxoda had smuggled gooas which he tried to lane at Chahbar and was caught by the Gendarmerie. Others say that the Askaris hau no Identity Cards and as they were armed they had been detained in custody. News are being awaited with interest about the release of the AsKaris and cargo etc. 282.

Actually those who are at the top are the real beneficiaries at the expense of those who are at the bottom. The donars, who are mainly the Indian merchants, oo not appear to be the willing contributors, as the tfar proiits due to inflation are dwindling and they do not seem to trust mucn m the integrity of the local officials, Their suspicions are more due to the fact that they have practically no liana in the distri bution of the cloth, which in Gwadur is tne prerogative oi tne Wall and the Amin of Customs. Some cloth had been distributed on the occasion of the f Id-ul-^itr, but I received sereral complaints that the oultanis received a favoured treatment. 285. 3.S* 'Barala* arrived from Kuscat on the 21st August 1946.

Bitts for the annual fish contract for ,1946-47 of Grwauur Customs, which commences from 1st September ana expires on the 3ist August each year, wjjiere helu in the Custom House from the 26th August to 30th August 1946. 70 Vincis of fishes are generally- caught at Grwaaur v/hich are considered to be marketable, but the contract is offered for 45 varieties which have a bigger catch. As it has already been explained previously ? the Muscat Govt, takes as Custom duty one fish after every 10 fishes caught by the fishermen. This is sola out to the fish merchants on the basis of yearly contract which is auctionea publicly by the Amin of Customs, Gwadur, unuer the auspicies of the Wali of Gwadur. The contractor is expected to buy all the Government fish thus collected at the contracted rates per 100 fishes of each variety once a week on cash payment. Seth Rehmt Ula Bashir, who is the biggest fish merchant at Gwadur, has been getting this contract for r,he last 9 years. He also took contract for the current year viz 1946-47 after a keen competition. Last year he paid is. 18000/- for the Government fish - this year his bids have been 65 % more than last year. The fish godowns belonging to the Sultan had been damaged iby the tidal waves and earthquake shocks last year, but the Sultan has sanctioned rs.2500/- for their repairs at the suggestion of the Administrator. Repairs will oe carried out unaer the supervision of the Amin of Customs. 291. Id-ul-Fitr was celebrated at Gwadur on the 29th August 1946. Over 200 guests called on me in different groups. Nearly 1 maund (80 lbs) Halwa was sent to my place by the various merchants etc, but they actually finished more than that in my house. The town looked quite gay and happy on the Id day with merry-go-rounds for the children. ky wife took the opportunity of presenting one gold xaxairgHx sovereign (purchased at 3.78/-) to the Mali’s son, which was the only way of paying back for the ghi - vide para 283 above- L thought I might let the Political Agent know aoout it, although ^ realize that it is a personal matter. &lt; 1 ' 292. In order to refund excess Custom duty of id. 1100/- gfoaggaatx on 10 tons extra sugar taken for tho control shops, the price of control sugar has been recently raised from annas 5 to annas 6 per kias. The control sugar - only 87 bags.were remaining at the end of August) will last for one month more - although aoout 14 tons of other sugar is still available in the town. I am doing my best to ensure that this sugar may last till we may f et new quota for the year 1947. As I have repeated pointed'out 0 tons of sugar for the whole year for Gwadur (and incidentally 60 tons of wheat for Gwauur fax per mensem) are too small quotas on the basis' of actual population in Gwadur area as well as scarcity of foodstuffs due to failure of rains in Llekran. 293. • On the 26th August 1946, the Control Committee fixed the price of* tefca 90 tons of Atta received from Karachi at 13.30/8 per oag against d.40/8 per bag of 2 Indian maunds for the previous consignment. ixshHaiaxaakxLtotai^xxxfidxifxkkaxim^ahaiikaxxkKaxkja jpjBxdxaialgaagikxaxfkxiBBxaLgxixfxxffii . The Atta is being distributed on ration cards, which has done away with the b&amp;ack market to a large extent ana everybody can get atta from the market without any difficulty at the fixed rates.

The new force of the Askaris comprises some minor boys anu 2 of them at least are only slightly bigger_ than their rifles. The Wall hopes that they will grow up quickly in Gwadur, but they all look underfed and shaoby. 291. Mr. Pritpal Singh, Locust Earning Officer, Panjgur, visitea I?

A certain Ali Mohd son of Ahmad, who is a British subject, residing at Grwauur as a petty shopkeeper, has run into debts amounting to 3.5000/- against total assests of ;s.720/-. His creuitors, ootn British and Sultan subjects, began, to.pester me lor the recovery of their dues, as they lost faith in him hut did not believe that he was a bankrupt. I appointed a Committee o^6 traders to report on his financial position followed by a Fanchyat on the 9th Septanoer, 1946. which was convened at the dali 1 s place, It was unanimpusly decided that .Ali Moha shoulu be allpwea 6 months to enaole him to stand, on his feet again and a security of 3.1000/- was taken from his father-in-law so that he may not abscond from Swadur. 295. Atta distribution on Ration Cards during the period under report has been most fair with no complaints whatsoever, but as Atta has been cheaper than millets, the owners of millet have sufferred ysrsegg from losses. In accordance with the Ration ^ards 90 tons Atta has lasted for 5 weeks, but the people must have saved some out of their rations ana the shopkeepers must also be Keeping • some for th* olacK marKet. 90 tons more Atta is Uvu&amp;Mr expected to reach Gwaaur shortly from Karachi. 294. I called on the 7ali on the 5th September 1946 accompanied t by the Administrator. The Wali appears to have received a bill for .s.1909/4 from the Sultan of Lluscat. for recovery of the amount which represents dieting charges and steamer fares oi 15 nhalasis of C.C. 7 Hyciri M 0 which san k on the 30th January 1946 en-route to Muscat f 7 mL5«r^re taken to Abadan and returned to Muscat oy a steamer. The 7/ali could not realize the amount in question trom the members of the crew concerned even by threats of imprisonment, as they are all reported to be destitutes ana some of them have already &amp;eft Gwadur. It was therefore decided that the Wall should try Messrs Lokoomal Jatwani, who were the owners of the ooat and ■ had paid for the expenses of the ere.? for their repatriation irom Muscat to Twadur. Messrs, Lokoomal Jatwani have however protested against payment of the bill referred to above ana their petition is being sent to the Political Agent, 1 uscat, separately, ihe consensus of opinion in Grwadur is that as the boat sank an an accident the aaaxsx owners of the boat are not at fault and that if the individuals concerned are unaole to reiund the cost of their repatriation, the Grovemmait should pay for them and write off the claim. 295. From the v/ali's conversation, it appealed, that the.Sultan may come to Gwadur during the next winter - at least the Jail wished that tne Sultan should pay. a visit to Gwadur sooner.or later, ine Wall is proposing to send his family to Muscat and is trying to arrange for passages. 296.

Mr. Mohd Hussain, Tehsildar, Jiwani, and Mr. Lohd Said, Tehsildar, Pasni, visited Gwaaur on the 10th September,1946, accompanied by over 1 dozen armed sepoys. They had set out in pursuit oi Hayatoon, tne muderer, who had been reported recently to have shpt^pt wounaed Hassan Hour in Fasni area. The Tehsildar of Pasni called on the 7ali aclxa and spent most of his time in Gwaaup with hauda i^abioux who is anxious to buy some more rice fre for the Jali irpp f-okran. Both the Tehsildars left for their respective places on the 11th September - one by lorry to Jiwani ana the other one by camels to Pasni. They were put up in the ‘Agency building and 4 of them dined with me. *» / o'* - 2 - 298. I heard fran a local person that ^ing Ibn Sa'ud may declare ’Jahad 1 Holy tfar against the Jews on the next Haj ^ay. .Then asxed to disclose the source of his information, he saiu that, perhaps, aomeone had reau this news in a vernacular paper and spread in Iwaciur. In Gfwadur there is generally speaking no place for foreign news, but the local population realize that the political conditions in Palestine and India are serious. 299. Owing to failure hi* rains during the summer, the salt wells at uori Rex - aoout 9 miles away from Gwaaur, are reported to oe drying up. There is no shortage of salt at Grwauur but ijori Rex nas important salt pans ana if their output is reducea, it mi,Jit affect the prices of the salt. 500. 3.S.

Mr. Rehntullah enquired from me v/hether it would be possible to start the Municipality now that they haa come to ^wadur ana that the Sultan had introuuced the Municipal taxation. I told him that unfortunately the Administrator hau returned to India. I however mentioned tna matfrer to the Wall. He said that as the decisions of the Municipality could not be carried out, so it was of no use to nominate raemoers ana to form a committee. 307. S.S. M 3amora M came from Muscat on the 19th September 1946. She took l70 tons of dry fish for Colombo, but no passengers except Khan Bahadur Abdul ^aiy and his family. 308. Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy's mission proved a failure for the following reasons from his as well as my point of view:- 1. Non-arrival from India of the proposed staff for the Administrator. 2. Old age of the Khan Bahadur ana lack of medical facilities ana other amenities of life at Grwadur. 3. Tepid reception by the 7ali of Gwadur ana Min of ' Customs of the Administrator as a senior memoer of their team. Somehow or other Khan Bahaaur Abdul Haiy was, however, very happy to go away from Owadur. 309. It has been reported to me that Messrs Pragji Nancy of Karachi are endeavouring to contact importers for oOO tons of American sugar 3) Rs.llbO/- per ton C.I.F. Gwadur.

They had been held up en-route, out were returned to the senuers at i^arachi by the ifcxx last mail being undelivered to the addressees as the contents were not covered by Export Permits. No more parcels are now expected to come to Gwadur of prohibited articles. 311. The mail has been coming 30 hours late on account of these parcels - but now for the last 10 days the Telegraph line is faulty. The merchants are simply fed up and uonot know what to uo. They /are anxious that as the land line is useless the Govt, should replace the Telegraph Office by a /ireless Btation. There are already tireless Stations at Pasm and Panjgur. P.T.0.f % 512. During the perioa unaer report large crowas of Balochis shifted from MeKran to Gwajuur owing to scarcity of ^ water ana foodstuffs. Many of them applieu for travel facilities to Karachi. The Passport oroKers have been making lot of mpney. I beat one in my office on the 21st September 1940 for having taken .,3.3/8 ±kx per head from 29 persons as their guarantor. 3ince he offered an apology ana had been sufficiently aisgraced in the public, I aid not send him to jail, but the action taken had some deterrent effect on his collegues, who are not making very frequent appearance in the Agency now. 515. The tfali lias issued an ’Alan forbiaaing gambling which han the desired effect. Gambling has stopped in xiubiic streets and thoroughfares but if it is going on secretly, there are no reports about JL'* 514. Recently dhows have been carrying 90 to 110 passengers from Gwadur to Karachi without adequate arrangements for annking water or their safety. I unaersainu thajf normally they are allowed to carry not more than 50 passengers provided they are not overloaded and possess life-belts etc for the safety of passengers. I have since drawn the attention of the brokers for passengers to Section 282 of I.P.0, anu have warned them that they may be liable to prosecution if an untoward incident takes place due to their negligence. It has been reported to me that when these dhows reach Karachi,, the NaKodas pay something to the officials concerned and let off the passengers. 515. Mr. Abdul Rasool, Inspector of Customs, Jiwani, came to Gwadur on the 27th September 1946 to ootain bias from the local fish merchants for the Jiwani uTLsh Contract for the perioa 1st October 1946 to 30th September ±946. I arranged meetings in the Agency of the fish merchants ana Seth Remitullah Bashir gave the highest bid viz fe. 16400/- . He had also taken the last yearns contEact at the same rate. The Inspector left for Jiwani on the 28th'September. It is expected that the above bid would further increase and may go up to fe.20000/-. The Jiwani fish contract is entirely on different basis than Gwadur. The Kalat State authorities take a lumpsum money from the contractor in 2 msk six monthly instalments and leave the rest to the contractor. 316. 90 tons Atta arrived from Karachi on Lhe 29th September 1946.

These representatives however began to indulge in black market at Colombo, but as soon as the Colombo authorities came to know of their activities, they demanded heavy taxes from them. 3 of them, managed to escape to India declaring themselves only as clerks of their firms in Gwadur and one of them who declared himself as a merchant § had to deposit a sini of s 14000/- in order to obtain an exit visa. There is little hope that he will get this money back, but the local fish merchants are contemplating to send a new representative to Jolomoo, who should look alter the interests of all of them. 318. A certain Agha Khani named ^llijah Llohd Aodulla Bachani who died at Gwadur in October 1941 had oequeathed about 10 houses and shops in favour of His Highness dir Agha idian, in order to seex his blessings and for the salvation of his soul. That property is now oeing sold unaer oraers of His Highness. 3 25000/- nave been realized upto now, but it is expected that the whole property will fetch about i\s.45000/- and then the proceeds will be remitted to His Highness. 319.

They have also oeen exchanging telegram messages of important nature when the telegraph line had oeen down recently Tor 41 weeks. 321. For the last fortnight, the Sub-Postmaster, Gwadur, has been unable to contact Karachi and consequently Karachi passed all messages for Gwadur to Panjgur. The Suo-Postmaster, Fanjgur kasxlasKHxiii was ill, so he passed them by lorry to Turoat. The public has thus been greatly inconvenienced. Since 3 days however a new Sub-Postmaster has come to Panjgur and telegrams are coming regularly. 322. O.G., F.A.F., Jiwani and Station Superintendent, 30AC, Jiwani, accomapnied by 3 R.A.F. xna European# personnel came to Gwadur by an K.A.F. truck on the 10th October 1946. They took lunch with me followed by afternoon tea - In the evening they called on the Pali with me and then went back. It was a pleasure trip only, I should think. 323. Recently the B0AG at Jiwani sold, out two of thpir trucks. There has been a rumour herd that the R.A.F. Jiwantalso intend to sell their trucks to the puolic. The 0C, R.A.F. confirmed this news ana the lali of Gwadur has since sent Kuaaa Haoibux as his representative to buyfof the trucks. He took introductory letter from me for the O.G. R.A.F. 324. The &amp;x£x Station Superintendent, Boac, Jiwani, tola me that they had received orders for closing down of their camp and were busy backloading their stuff. He offered me provisions viz. Butter, Tinned Fruits and Jams which I am expecting from him shortly. I have also made enquiries from him about Iron-beds and mattresses and his reply is awaited. In November next he expected pears to have been made an emergency landing ground for sea-planes. to visit Gwadur a^ain as Gwadur P.T.0.325. There is a local rumour kbat the Sultan has accepted the services of Captain J.B. Howes, as his Adviser and Captain Howes will join at Muscat in November or December.

Mr. Zaifar Hussain has been relieved by Mr. Prem Nath. 328. The Director of drains, Karachi, had informed me that the rate of wheat per maund which was being issued to Grwaaur was Rs.9/lQ per maund. Recently Messrs Volkart f s billed my Agent's at Karachi at the rate of'is. 11/5 per maund. The Controller of Food, New Delhi, also confirmed that thisx E3.9/1Q was a mistake and that the correct rate was Rs.11/5.

Aauda Abdulla askeu the Wall to release the fisherman, out the Wall said that he had taKen a vow to keep the fisherman in jail for one month. Kauaa Abdulla said that it was not justice. 2. The Wall in oruer to smuggle rice from Jiwani has become very frienuly with Kama Aziz of Jiwani tnrough Kauda Nabibux of Grwadur, but Kauda Aziz who , y(o originally a Muscat subject, is a great ememy of ♦ the Sultan of Muscat. ^ ’ o j 3.

The local cotton merchants, it is understood, have submitted a petition to Government of India throit^h the Chamber of Coiamerce, Karachi, stating that i under Govt, of India notification Finance Department (Central Revenues) No.3 Camp aateu 26-2-45 cotton grown in Las iiela and Kalat State and imported therefrom oy sea into British India is entitled to exemption from duty. That the cotton that comes into Gwadur is cotton grown in Kalat State. Pasni and Gwadur are ports on the Mekran Coast and no cotton is grown in or around either Pasni or Gwanur, but is grown in the interior exclusive! in Kalat State. There should thus be no difficulty in allowing imports of Kalat State cotton either from Pasni or Gwadur, if the produce originally is that of Kalat State. The decision of the Government of India is awaited, out they have received an ad interim reply that the matter is under consideration oy the Government of India. 557.

Towards the end of the fortni jii some cases were reported in which shopkeepers refused to accept old find mutilated notes of the In dan currency - in most cases 1-rupee notes. This is believed to be due to a press report that the Pakistan Currency Offices will not exchange blu notes of the Inaian currency after the 30th of June x948. This news is apparently responsible for the .anxiety of merchants and the Grwadur Customs to uispose of as many old notes as possible ‘inu not to receive such notes from public in their transactions. Grwadur be in- in the Pakistan sphere of trade and there beirv; no arran .'emarE by the Muscat Government for exchange of such notes of the Indian currency, the anxiety of the merchant community can be well appreciated.

It is understood that the Amin of Custom has instructions from the Muscat Treasury not to send 1 .and 2-rupee notes when remitting the Customs receipts* This has led to an accurrmulation of about Rs. 8000 of such notes in the Customs chest. 16®.
