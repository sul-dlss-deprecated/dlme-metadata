Now, on the admission of Mr. Vyshinsky, by the authority of the High Command of Soviet Russia, they were stopped. What is there to negotiate about? Were they in fact stopped? If they were, then there was an infringement of this treaty, and I do not think there is any answer to that. The treaty is perfectly clear. And what is to be the result of such negotiations? What is there to decide? I have been listening to this discussion for all these* days, and as I read the claim made by the Iranian Government, it is that the tripartite treaty should be strictly observed, and that the security forces and officials, as appointed by the Iranian Government, should be allowed to do their duty, as ordered by that Government. I would like to put it to the Soviet Delegate, if I may, in the friendliest fashion: is that denied to the Iranian Government? The treaty is clear. If my Government had done this and I was charged with it, I should not regard it as a question of dignity for the Council to enquire into it and tell me whether I had done wrong or right. I do not regard it as a question of the dignity of a State, if the Security Council, charged with this matter, has it investigated and indeed makes a pronouncement as to whether you have or have not carried out your obligation under the treaty. Personally, I have no objections to discussions between the Soviet Government and the Iranian Government, but I must say to the Council that we too, are parties to the treaty. What is going to be decided under this treaty? I understand that is the only thing under discussion, although in the statement of the SovietOUTWARD TELEGRAM 4r. Soviet Union they refer to the danger to the Baku oilfields. I cannot imagine the Iranian Army or anybody else attacking the Soviet Army and endangering the Baku oilfields - I really cannot. I think that is rather an exaggeration. Nor can I really imagine the Soviet authorities being unable to maintain sufficient protection against saboteurs or anything referred to in the Soviet statement. It goes rather deeper than that. We and the United States communicated with the Soviet Government and we did regard the answer as not being conclusive or satisfactory. We want to promote peace and there is one thing I would like to say about this. You will, I am perfectly certain, Mr. President, pull me up if I am going astray, but this thing did look to us in this country like a war of nerves. It did really look like the prescription laid down in, and quoted by the Iranian Government from Mr. Litvinoff's definition of what constituted aggression. I am quite certain if this can be eliminated it will be for the benefit of the peace of the world. I am quite willing for these discussions to take place, but as a party to the Treaty I would ask the Soviet Government to agree with us to leave it on the Agenda. It has been subject to public discussion here and there is another reason, a very sound reason which would apply to my country or to the United States if we were in a similar position. We are powerful countries; we are what is sometimes described as the 'Big Three' I certainly am a good physical representative of the Big Three ( Laughter ), But we do represent power and power does count in negotiations. There are armies in Iran. They are there by the kindness of Iran, to whom I am sure every ally, having regard to the victory we have won and the transportation thatOUTWARD TELEGRAM 5. that it represented to us in our very darkest moments, must feel a sense of gratitude. Yet that small pov/er has to negotiate vdth an army of I cannot tell how many thousands on her territory at this moment. But it does seem to me for them to have to negotiate alone without shall I say, the watchfulness, the sense of justice and the holding of the balance of this new United Nations organisation at their disposal, would he most unfortunate and would he misunderstood. Indeed, I personally take the view that, if I was in this position and it was my government, with the power, military and economic, that we represent, that was in conflict or dispute or disagreement with any small power, I should welcome that small power having at its elhow the assistance of a Council of this character. I can only conclude hy saying that I sincerely trust the matter is not in dispute. We stand for the integrity of Iran, without interference in her sovereignty: for the removal of troops from her territory as quickly as we can, and the last man to go hy the date we have agreed; for leaving her and her people to work out their political and economic salvation in their own way; and for us, as great powers, not to sit in judgement upon them as regards their internal affairs. Therefore, if talks can proceed - and I hope they will - between the two powers primarily concerned, I sincerely hope we shall not he put in the position of being asked at this stage to take the question off the Agenda and so leave a small power negotiating in what I should regard as the most adverse circumstances. Indeed, I should think my own dignity and everything else would he enhanced if I allowed her to have, in the conduct of these negotiations, all the assistance she required.&lt;&gt; •f E. m OOPY OUTWARD TELEGRAM r ~EXT 763 946 [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be / retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] CABINET DISTRIBUTION H FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN D, 10.55 p.m. January 28th,1946.

Q Q Q D/MEDIriTE The Persian application came before the Security Council on 28th January. The President said that he proposed to invite the Persian Delegate to the table to participate in the discussion without vote, in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter. This was agreed unanimously and M. Taqufcadeh took / his place. 2. The President then said he intended to invite the Persian and Soviet Delegates to supplement their written statements by any oral remarks. The Soviet Delegate did not object to this procedure but stressed that, as he had said at the previous meeting, he agreed to discussion only of the proceduri aspect of the case, and not of its substance. The proposed procedure was accepted by the Council. 3. The Chief Persian Delegate then read out an exposition of the Persian case on familiar lines. He referred in his remarks to a further memorandum, which has turned out to be an 80 page docuraent_which will not be available for study/ POL DEPT. 1 31 JAN 1948 J INDIA OFFICE!7 OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - study before Wednesday. He described the Soviet-Persian case as a 'dispute' and said that it was brought to the notice of the Security Council under article 35. He emphasised that the Persian government had tried direct negotiation with the Soviet government but had failed to obtain satisfaction. He asked the Security Council to make the following recommendations: (1) That the Soviet Government should in future observe the Tripartite Treaty of alliance and not interfere in Persian internal affairs or with the movement of Persian security forces and officials. (2) That the Soviet Government should give orders that its forces were to be completely withdrawn from Persia by 2nd March,1946, (3) That until this date Persian security forces should be free to move throughout Persia including Izorba^an. (4) That the Soviet Government should withdraw all material and moral support from the dissidents in Azerbaijan and elsewhere. 4. The Chief Soviet Delegate (M.Vyshinski) after remarking that the Persian appeal to the Security Council and the supporting documents had been drawn up bya government which was not now in power, said that he proposed to confine himself to the procedural aspect. He did not agree that direct negotiations between the Soviet and Persian governments as prescribed by Article 33 had failed: he/.....&amp; OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 3 - he maintained that the Persian note of 1st December, after which the Persian government put forward no further complaints, showed that direct negotiations had been successful. The Soviet Government had always been and still were ready to conduct direct negotiations with the Persian government. He therefore maintained that there was no ground for examination of the Persian case by the Security Council, under articles 33(2),34,36 or 37 of the Charter. He hoped that the Security Council would leave the matter to be settled direct negotiation between the tv*o parties concerned. 5. The President then declared that he must point out to the Soviet Delegation that they would not have a vote in further discussion since the Persian application related to a 'dispute”. No Delegation commented on this statement. 6. The President proposed adjournment of the discussion until 3 p.m. London time on 30th January.

[Begins] Owing to interference of the Soviet Union, through the medium of their officials and armed forces, in the internal affairs to Iran, a situation has arisen which may lead to international friction. 2. In accordance with Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations the Iranian Government have repeatedly tried to negotiate with the Government of the • Soviet Union, but have met with no success. 3.

Persian iimbassador called on Sir -a.Cadogan yesterday evening and said that his Delegation had been having long discussions as to how they were to bring their dispute with the Soviet Government before the United Nations. They had finally come to the conclusion of the General Assembly. 2, They seemed to have found two objections in the way of applying to the Security Council. They thought it would be harder to secure inclusion in the agenda as they would require 7 votes out of 11. (Under the provisional rules for the General xissembly any item may be added to the agenda during a session by a simply majority of States represented and voting). In the second place they have been warned that there might be long arguments to the effect that the Security Council was not yet fully consituted as the Secretary-General and had not yet been appointed. Sir k 9 Cadogan remarked that he thought there was little in the latter that there was a balance of advantage in putting it on the agenda /pointOUTWARD TELEGRAM r 5? 552 point as the Chairman of the Security Council had formally stated the previous day that the Council was constituted and no objection had been raised). 3* Before actually bringing the matter before the General Assembly the Persian Delegation wished, however, to be sure that they would have a majority in the assembly for approving its % inclusion in the agenda. The Ambassador inquired whether the United Kingdom Delegation would vote in this sense, and on my instructions Sir A.Cadogan later informed the Ambassador that they would. At this point however, the Ambassador said his Delegation was still considering the matter and would only reach a decision to-day. I have since heard that they are now inclining more to one Council. 4. .At the conversation the Ambassador also enquired whether Sir ^.Cadogan thought it likely that the Persian Government would secure a majority vote in the Assembly. Speaking personally Sir A.Cadogan replied that he thought there was little doubt that they would do so, since there were many in the Assembly who were 'jealous of the powers of the Security Council and would be glad of an opportunity to take this political matter on the Assembly’s agenda.

Much wire pulling in which everything, except the fate of Persia is being debated, can be observed. Prime Minister was on the point of resigning yesterday but did see the point when asked at my instigation what impression he ’ REfiS* PfcL.

All Tudeh and other pro-Russian influences are against appeal to UNO and no one can predict what will happen. Dr. Musaddiq now denies that he recommended recourse to UNO: he merely wanted this door to be kept open. The Cabinet is very weak and could only recover support of most of its former majority by getting rid of two members who are accused of flirting with Tudeh Saleh and Nariman. They however refuse to resign and he told me the situation is so obscure that to get rid of them, the Prime Minister might have to offer resignation of the whole Cabinet. L. Minister for Foreign Affairs has not published Anglo-American proposal because he says that he fears that instead of appeal to UNO getting a fair chance of support it would be prejudiced by mud-throwing about tripartite commission from the Left. As a breath might blow the Government over I have deferred to this opinion for the present. Foreign Office please pass to Washington as my telegram No. 3L.

The settlements outside U.N.O. may at first sight protect the Organisation from being tested too severely but I fear that any direct settlement between Russia and Persia so long as oviet troops remain in the North, will be such as to prejudice not only iersian and British interests but also the future of U.N.O. 2. You are well aware of the forms the pressure takes but I may remind you of some of them. The Soviet troops are in larger numbers and in closer occupation than at height of the war. Some are only 10 miles from Tehran. No one can enter North Persia without being interrogated and his vehicle searched by Soviet troops. Tass correspondent at Tabriz gives the world the Soviet oTf- JAN 1946 QFF1Q news/....news while toe Soviet authorities find it inopportune for British and American correspondents to go. Soviet authorities still run all railways north east and west from Tehran: they allow alleged democrats to withhold trains from Tehran but if iersian Government decided to stop the trains from going into the Soviet zone Soviet pressure to reverse decision would be irresistible. Vnd so on. 5. e may find it absurd that Persians who have resisted until now should show signs of surrender when arch 2nd is so near and when U.tJ.O. is at last getting to work but we must make allowances for unscrupulous soviet pressure and do what we can to help e.g. by ensuring as far as we can that speedy attention is given to ; ersian appeal to U.N.O. and by seeing that sustained Soviet pressure on Fersia receives sustained notice in British press.

At the same time he expressed the opinion, as a matter of future general practise, it did not appear very advisable for a great power to assume # responsibility, as His Majesty's Government had done m this instance, of dissuading a small country from invoking machinery of the United Nations Organisation whenever it thought fit.

The Security Council on the other hand seems the appropriate organ for q question of this sort which is certainly one of ‘’security 5 ’. Moreover where are much greater prospects of persuading the Soviet Government to agree to some form of settlement through the Security Council, which is their preferred organ, than through the Assembly.

If the Persian Government decide to put the matter ' on the agenda of the Security Council, they would be well advised to give their Delegation here clear instuuctiops on the above lines as to procedure.

Although Britain had not always been popular in the east before the war, all eastern countries now looked to us to see that Soviet expansion at their expense was halted. Azerbaijan was a test-case and if Soviet infiltration tactics succeeded there, similar methods would be used against Turkey fiid tten Afghanistan. The Ambassador admitted that, although the long-standing Oxus frontier dispute still caused him some anxiety, there were no signs at present of any special Soviet pressure against Afghanistan. 2. The new Iraqi Minister and other Middle East representatives here have shown similar tendency to regard Azerbaijan as a test-case. I have taken the line that a solution must be found in the spirit and within the framework of the Anglo-Soviet alliance and of the United Nations Organisation and that it will do no good to regard this as a tug-of-war between us and the Russians. 1 RECd« PiL ; ’ 1 ’ JAN 194 f j ■ 1 INDIA OFFICE |I NW A TELEGRAM Allotted to External De partment .

Following background guidance on Moscow Conference communique may be of use informally but should not (repeat not) be issued to press textually in whole or in part. Please pass to Information and Broadcasting Department. General. Task of building peace is difficult and requires patience, understanding and confidence. One conference such as this does not solve all problems. It is a further stage on the way. If its conclusions are carried out in a good spirit they will lead on to next stage. Many questions not mentioned in communique were discussed, but Turkey,Greece, Spain and Trusteeship were not (repeat not) discussed. Next meeting of the three Foreign Ministers is to be in Washington, but date not yet fixed. There was daily contact between Foreign Secretary and Dominion Representatives in Moscow. Part I. Peace Treaties. The three Governments were unanimous in wanting to break deadlock of September, and to get'Peace Treaties in train. This is essential preliminary to settlement of political and economic troubles of Europe. Agreed document is admittedly a compromise but is is a reasonable compromise which associates with, peace-making United Nations who have taken substantial part in the war. Part II. Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan. Control machinery for Japan has no?; been placed on collective basis and Soviet Government is to participate. Far Eastern Commission is no longer an advisory body but is charged primarily ?/ith task of formulating policy for fulfilment of surrender terms for Japan. Allied Council has been set up in Tokyo to advise Supreme Commander on implementation of policy. China was specially consulted and her concurrence obtained because she is primarily concerned as a party to Cairo proclamation and Potsdam declaration. Part III. Korea.• Independent democratic Government is to be set up as soon as possible. A trusteeship is contemplated, but only for a period of up to five years. Part IV. This section of communique is in harmony with President Truman’s recent statement on United States policy in China. Parts V and VI- Roumania and Bulgaria. H.M.G. are trying to apply solution similar to that applied in case of Poland. Objective is to arrange for introduction into respective Governments o:° representatives of parties which have greatest degree of popular support, viz. Peasant and Liberal parties in Roumania and Agrarian in Bulgaria, though / latterlatter is not specified'in communique. We hope that, if this can he done . the re ore anise cl Governments, feeling surer popular supports \tx 1 1 he able to he less repressive in thfhr methods* t Recognition of Governments In these two countries vriel enable us to proceed, with peacn*-making and restoration of normal conditions in Balkans* Reason^for differentiation between Bulgaria and Roumania is Soviet Government's insistence that, as elections had already taken place in Bulgaria, there was no basis for formal- Three^Power intervention* Agreement reached, however, gives United Kingdom and United States Go'ernments opportunity to decide for * themselves* whether there has been sufficient change in character of Bulgaria^?* Government to justify them in recognising it. ' Part VII* Atomic Energy&gt; Object -was to follow up Washington Declaration of, 15th NoveniBer by'agreeing with Poviet Government on means for developing international co-operation under U.N.O. Communique shows that this first step has been successful. . . Responsibility for Commission is nicely balanced be tween General Assembly and Security Council* On one hand/ owing go paramount considerations of security, resolution before Assembly is .to be sponsored by permanent members of Security” Council, plus Canada (owing to her association-with United States and United Kingdom in development of atomic energy)* Commission's reports are to be sent In first instance to Security Council and membership of Commission is to be same; as that of Security'Council pins Canada when Canada is not a member of latter.

Washington 2 2 My telegram No.47* It is very important that the Anglo-American proposal t both for their sake and ours. if the Per s' Government reject hey should do it in the best way They may be exposed to criticism that they ignore the genuine grievances in Azerbaijan, and we are criticised for dissuadin, on the agenda of the United them from putting their complaints ations Assembly. As soon therefore as negotiations break down I propose to suggest privately to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his reply to British and United States Embassies should be on the following lines. 2. (i) The Persian Government thanks for efforts to find solution but considers causes of the trouble are such that they cannot be solved by the method proposed. (ii) The Persian Government tnau abandoned the intention to place the question of Persia on the United Nations agenda. The object was to allow time for examination of the proposal and to show spirit of conciliation c The result however has been to deprive [grps.undec. Persia and Russia of unique] opportunity since grievances could have been filed without obligation to obtain support of given number of other states, Persia is however so sure of the justice of her case that she willingly forewent this opportunity confident that if she wished to raise the question later nho could secure the necessary support. (iii) Persian Government accept principle on which proposal is based, viz that good system of provincial Government is required throughout Persia. One of the first laws passed in first Majlis of 1907 (of which Azerbaijan deputies were a most important and patriotic part) was on providing councils. Ministry of the Interior recently gave orders for preparations to be made for election in accordance with this law. Nevertheless Persian Government admitted that the law has many defects due to inexperience of the Majlis and desire to bring it into line with modern ideas. Persian Government therefore invites suggestions for amendments from British(and American) Governments. (iv) To prove the sincere desire to introduce, reforms Persian Government announces firm intention to invite Economic and Social Council of United Nations when formed to appoint experts to advise the Persian Government on measures to improve [grp, undec, ? living] conditions. Although prevailing misery is due largely to inflation resulting from expenditure of foreign troops, Persian Government does not wish to plead for this as -excuse for inaction but desires to undertake reform forthwith under the auspices of appropriate orgaif ££ r Unit ed\ Nat ions. ‘ /3 a- 2 - 5. I hope that this meets with your approval and should he glad to have telegraphed instructions as soon as possible. Foreign Office please pass to Washington as my telegram No.17.

There is to be a big expansion of electric power and irrigation schemes and three new branches of industry, light and heavy metallurgy and rubber, are to be established. The message also speaks of consideration for the material requirements of the population and adds that big! oublic works are contemplated to improve the city of Baku and other leading towns. 2. Although this annoucement is no doubt part of the general publicity campaign for the new Five Year Plan, it ^ 4 coincides conveniently with developments in Persian Azerbaijan. Hew Times article on the latter province mentioned in my telegram Ho.3 Saving spoke of its material resources which had not been properly developed under Persian rule.

Nevertheless at least three bdses full of Persian army officers and their families left Tabriz yesterday under Democrat escort for Tehran. In connexion with People’s Army recruiting drive, a large parade of 'Fida’is', estimated at about 50 horsemen and about 2,000 on foot* was held yesterday in main street of Tabriz. Section leaders were armed with tommy-guns and rank and file with rifles; one or two light machine-guns were also carried. Parade was perfectly orderly, and public morale is improving. 2, Telegraph office reports that line to Rezaieh is again cut, but lines to Tehran and Ardebil working satisfactorily* 3. Tomorrow, National Parliament will discuss 7-article bill put forward by Pishavari, Prime Minister, Yusuf Azimah* Minister of Justice and Dr.Salamullah Javid, Minister of the Interior in the 'National Government of Azerbaijan'. The bill provides for the release of all political prisoners convicted before December 12th, 1945, prisoners unjustly arrested by former Persian military authorities, those imprisoned on frivolous charges and those sentenced to less than one year's detention. Long-term convicts are to have their sentences reduced' and those condemned to death are to have their sentence commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment. 4..

I fear the Persian Government will not venture to give way on (1) minority languages (2) Persian participation in the Commission, They would also want to insert (3) date by which recommendations must be tendered and (A) proviso that recommendations must be within the framework of Persian constitution. I have repeated my arguments on the two first points and am providing the Minister for Foreign Affairs with evidence about the language privileges enjoyed by the [grp undec ? Kurds] of Iraq. Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that one of the concessions Bayat was authorised to offer when he went to Tabriz as Governor General was the teaching of Turki in the lower classes of schools. He says that he himself favours the introduction of this reform for other non-Persian languages, but that the government do not want the subject to be mentioned in the terms of reference. The third amendment seems to me reasonable. As to the fourth I said that I feared that the Russians and the Azerbaijanis would consider the Azerbaijan case was prejudged by the wording. On the other hand British and American members of the Commission could be trusted even without mention of the constitution in the terms of reference to keep it in mind. (Article 10 was intended to safeguard the Persian position in this respect but the Minister for Foreign Affairs points out with spme reason that the Azerbaijan Government is loud in protesting its loyalty to fundamental unity of the Persian Stale. 3. I have pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the acceptance of our proposal substantially as it is would have two advantages for the Persians: 1)X 4 - 2 - ? f settlement without a row in the new United Nations Organisation intpnri^^+ ar + n ^ e ? Persian Government intended to tackle [grp omitted] seriously.

Tell him that in any case, although I regret differing from him I am convinced that, ‘had the’Persian Government placed their dispute with Russia on the Assembly agenda at this stage, they would have v/recked any chance of Russian acceptance of the proposal for a tripartite commission. Moreover, in my view, by refraining from placing this question on the agenda of the Assembly now, the Persian Government are in no way deprived of the possibility of raising the question later. It could be raised at the Assembly if a majority is obtained for placing it on the Agenda. In our view, however, it would be better for the question to come up before the Security Council since the matter is so largely one of security. This can be done if any seven out of eleven members of the Security Council agree (as the ’’Great Power Veto” does not apply in a procedural vote of this kind). 3. I find Byrnes’ argument, as described in paragraph 2 of your telegram No.58, somewhat difficult to follow. He was aware that the Persian Government was to be asked to express a favourable opinion on the tripartite commission proposals in order that we might then make a further approach to the Russians. Since we have not yet been informed of the Persian Government’s agreement, there has been no opportunity to put the proposals to the Russians again and therefore no opportunity of seeing whether or not the Russians are prepared 'to play. 4. Please point this out to Byrnes.

The following summary of sentiment in this country regarding recent events in Azerbaijan, so far as it is possible to gauge it, may be of interest, 1. G overnment The dominant reaction is .^ nr ^ a ^9 n ^ pv « fear and distrust of Russia, which has become the red bog y to all the propertied classes. This fear results m a) a feeling of satisfaction and security at the continued presence of British troops here; b) the beginning of a more enlightened attitude to legitimate Kurdish aspirations and Kurdish welfare generally* 2. Kurdistan In the Sulaimani Liwa far apparently no expressions of sympathy with the separaoists* In the Erbil Liwa. however, there # is evidence that some Kurds may be looking towards Russia for that support against the 'Arab Government' which they now feel they will not receive from us. Those tribes who helped to expel ^-dll^- Mustafa are naturally apprehensive of his vengeance, with Russian aid. 3. Kurdish intellectuals There is no evidence that educated Kdrds regard tne Azerbaijan movement v/ith any enthusiasm or sympathy. 4. Assyr ians Assyrians enlisted in Royal Air Force Levies are as yet quite unaffected; but there evidence that Issyrians elsewhere may be idea that Russia should once again be regarded as a potential friend, 5. The Holy C ities The Ulema, who.are nearly all Persians, are naturally alarmed; but opinion generally is more detached than mignt have been expected. o.. 6 . To sum up, the reaction hitherto in Iraq has -heen one of moderate hut growing apprehension. . Those nationalists who might have liked, to proclaim a 'quit Iraq' •'Campaign against Britain would now find less real response in .-any class of society than seemed probable six weeks aga v , Please pass to Moscow if desired.

Osborne, No,59 SAVING December 22nd,1945 CONFIDENTIAL R. 4*20 p.m* January 2nd,1946* Q Q Q An eminent ecclesiastic, with special knowledge of the Middle East, whose information and forecasts during the war years were remarkably often correct (he has asked me not to mention his name if I should quote his views), told me on December 20 th that he regarded the present situation as regards Russian and Azerbaijan as roughly identical with the situation at the time of Munich as regards Germany and Czechoslovakia* If the Russians got away with Azerbaijan, the ’’democratic” Government of which would no doubt shortly appeal to be received within the Soviet Union, their next moves would be against Turkey (this expectation has already proved correct) and among the Kurds. Persia and Turkey would be absorbed or dominated. He diagnosed what Lord Halifax has defined in the last sentence of his telegram No.8295 as progressive and deliberate disturbance of the Middle East in accordance with a methodically planned pattern of aggression. In his opinion this plan contemplates an advance across the Middle East to India, the gold and other wealth of which offer rich spoils to a modern Genghis Khan. Modern Russian methods were analogous with Hitler's and Russian ambitions no less far- reaching, Communism was no longer the inspiration of Russian poli^ but a valuable instrument of Russian imperialism. The Comintern, as an international body, had been abolished and .the policy that it used to plan was now in Russian hands alone; the Titos, Togliattis, Thorez, Dimitrovs, etc. were all collaborating abroad.FILE COPY P°\ ( 1 U' I'O k +u ^ . 1 P arL 1 c uj *a^ secrecy and shou!

You were returning now to consult the Persian Government and if a reply could be obtained quickly we would go into the matter again immediately, I had not been in a position to settle anything in Moscow because I had not the views of the Persian Government as to whether they would favour the proposal. I advised the Ambassador to tell his Government to keep calm and steady, and consider the whole situation with you on your arrival in Tehran. 2.

It seems to me that this action of the Persian Government is likely to kill our Moscow proposals for the appointment of a tripartite commission for the establishment of Provincial Councils for Persia* As the Moscow discussion showed the whole business anyway is a gamble as far as the Russians are concerned and Persian action is likely to forfeit us any support in that quarter there may have been. 3.

Strict order is being maintained in Tabriz and armed forces of democrats in town much reduced. Policy of new government is to organise strong regular army as quickly as possible with local Russian equipment and instructors. Recruits are offered 150 rials per mensem in addition to keep uniform etc. Many other ranks of disbanded Persian Garrison will probably join. Most Persian army officers have gone home. It is believed that Commandant of Garrison and five senior officers left for Tehran yesterday by air. 2, While new Government controls Persian Government’s balances in local branch of National Bank they are obviously feeling the need for cash. They have prohibited the drawing of more than 20,000 rials(£l54) on any private account and advertised the sale of 100 tons of Government sugar which should bring in about 6 million rials (about £470,000). 3. All quiet in other towns of eastern Azerbaijan but situation in Rezaieh obscure. Reports of heavy fighting then are not reliable but Russians admit r, an exchange of shots”. It is probable that Persian garrison has surrendered. I shall try to visit Rezaieh myself to-morrow. 4.

Various rumours have been circulating during last few days to the effect that the Soviet Government had made a proposal to the Persian Government to the effect ( 1 ) that the latter should enter into direct negotiations with Azerbaijan 'Democratic” Government; (2) that if a satisfactory settlement was reached Russian troops would be withdrawn immediately; (3) that if the Persian Government was unable to reach agreement the Soviet Government would arbitrate. 2, I tackled the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this to-day. He said there was no truth in this story. Soviet Government had so far made no move; they had not even replied to the Persian Prime Minister's offer to go to Moscow. He was in fact without any news and asked whether I had any to give him. He remained, he said, very preoccupied over the situation and continued, the presence in Northern Persia of Soviet troops and of their sinister partisans and hangers-on boded ill for the futoae. He could npt say where or when the next blow would fall butfce was ^somewhat worried about'' the provinces of ^ Mazanderan Gilan and even Khorassan.- In this connexion a recent ^incident at-'Semnan (about 100'miles east of Tehran oj^ the'main'road'to MeshecQ^was 4 indicative4 if not signif icantTJ Here a well-known bandit was holding up supplies and generaiuy misbehaving with complete impunity, thanks to the protection of Russian military forces and Persian Government’s consequent inability to intervene.

Ambassador, ¥ith reference to your letter of 25th November, addressed to the People s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, V.IH Holotov, on the subject of Iran, I think it necessary to draw your attention to the following. According to the information at the disposal of the Soviet Government, the National Assembly, elected by the Azerbaijani population of the Northern districts of Iran, addressed a declaration to the Shah, the Mailis and the Government of Iran, in which it expressed the wish that the Azerbaijani population of Northern Iran should be guaranteed democratic rignts to national autonomy within the boundaries of the state of Iran. • This National Assembly, which took place in Tabriz on November 20th/2lst, was preceded by crowded meetings of the local population, which were peaceful in character and dia not provoke any disturbances in the Northern provinces of Iran. Notwithstanding the fact that the wish expressed in the afore said declaration contains nothing unusual for a democratic state, the local forces of the gendarmerie, having as their aim the terrori- sation of the democratic elements in Northern Iran, provoked a series of undesirable incidents in some parts of Iranian Azerbaijan. After this the Government of Iran raised the question of sending additional units of the military and gendarmerie into Northern provinces of Iran. It is known to the Soviet Government that two Iranian brigades of infantry, one regiment of infantry, two regiments of the gendar merie and police units are stationed in these provinces, and that their quantitative composition can secure order and tranquillity in these places. The movement of these units of the military, the gendarmerie and the police in the districts of Northern Iran has never been impeded by the Soviet military command in the past nor is it being impeded at present. As regards the sending of additional Iranian forces to Northern Iran, such action, in the opinion of the Soviet Government, might aggravate the situation, increase the dis turbances in the districts and possibly cause bloodshed, which would force the Soviet Government to bring in additional forces of its own in order to maintain order and secure the safety of Soviet garrisons* Kft. POL SLPli 2 t DEClHt IND'A ACE In...- 2 - - In view of the foot that the Sovie^'^Gb.vernment consider that the bringing in of additional Soviet forces to Iran is un desirable, it took up a negative.attitude towards the sending of new Iranian forces to the-Northern districts of Iran. In so far as reference is made in your letter to the tripartite Treaty of 1942 and the declaration of the Three Powers on Iran, I have to state that in- accordance with this treaty and declaration, the Soviet Government invariably carries out a * policy of respect for the territorial integrity, suzerainty and independence of Iran.' Please accept, lx. Ambassador, the assurance of my highest respect. V. Dekamozov. [Ends] ^ «.* • Foreign Office please pass to Washington and Tehran as my telegrams 765 and 192'respectively.

Nevertheless, if we are to admit that these legitimate grievances justify the behaviour of the Russians, we are started down a long and slippery slope, for in this part of the world at least the Russians could always find sane sacred reason for intervention. They are however in a very strong position and I can only hope that it may be turned by some such approach to the problem as I have suggested in my telegram No. 1310* _ 3 . The declaration makes no mention of the Kurds but if Azerbaijan obtained a wide autonomy it would be easy for the Azerbaijan ''National' Council to grant autonomy (always within the limits of Azerbaijanian territorial integrity etc.) to Persian Kurdistan. Copies of this despatch and its enclosures are being sent to Government of India, Middle East Ofiice, Bagdad, Ankara and (without enclosures) Tabriz.

November 2Crd., 1945. &lt; r.“— 1SS] Sir, jy I have the honour to inform you, with reference to my Despatch No. 16 , that I visited Mlaneh yesterday, November 2Tnd. I invited my Amerlcair'c lleague to go with me, but he was unable to do so for two reesohsi one, that it aas Thanksgiving Day; the other, that he thought the regulations of his service would not permit him. Vhen I suggested that Mianeh was probably in his Consular District, as it is in mine, the idea seemed to strike him as novel, but too dii'ficult for immediate assimilation. 2. I left Tabriz at 7.30 in the morning in the car of this Consulate-General, accompanied by my chauffeur and my interpreter. Snow had fallen during the night and there was a thick mist on all the hills from Tabriz until beyond the Shibli Pass. 20 miles away. For the first tixty miles, as far as Ciah (or Gara) Chaman, the deeply rutted snow and ico on the gradients made travelling very slow. Beyond Turkman Chai, however, conditions improved and I was able to make the journey to Mianeh (l20 miles) in 5-^ hours. 3. No gendarme posts re -ain anywhere on the road between Tabriz and Mianeh. Pickets of armed Democrats were posted at Bustanabad, Goja Giyaz, at a little pass the name of which I do not know, at Gara Cha*an, Aliabad and Turkman Chai. They were stopping all vehicles and searching for arms. They allowed me to pass without delay when I said who I was - on one occasion I showed lay Russian permit, which was immediately respected - and none of the men offered the slightest discourtesy. According to .g/- driver and interpreter most of them were Muhajirs (recent immigr nts from the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan). I spoke to them in Russian and only once, during both journeys, faileu uo get a response-in tuat language. A few seemed to mo to be local peasants, and one or two looked like young townsmen of the better sort, out the majority certainly looked like Muhajirs, and some had a distinctly military bearing. The biggest picket was at Turkman Chai: between sixty and sevexity men, wearing oddments of Persian army uniforms which were being distributed from t vo lorries as I passed. I saw' no arms other than rifles. 4. There is now no Russian check post at the entrance to Mianeh. There is no Democrat picket there either. I drove to the centre of the town, noticing a good number of Persian soldiers, without their arms and some in only hall uniform. The shops were open and the appearance of the single street was very much as usual. An armed Persian policeman was on guard outside the Police station, but a few yards from him a democrat armed .vith a rifle was also! on guard. Traffic from Tenran was coming through the town normally. I had passed six or seven buses, about a dozen A.I.O.J. lorries and twenty or thirty private lorries on my way down. But all cars were bein^ stopped and passengers interrogated and sometimes searched by the pickets, and private lorries were liable to re.raiaitioning. /5. Dir A. &lt;*. Bullard, K. C.B. ,£• C.M.G. , C.I.B. , H.M. Ambassador, TEHRAN- 8 - 5* I called first on the Soviet Town Com and ant, Lieutenant kuharraaioff. He is, of course, a Caucasian. He received me in a mostB courteous and friendly manner, and asked in what way he could help me*^ ^'suppose that he had been w rned of my arrival, but this, naturally* ne did not s f :y. Another Kussian officer was present throughout our inter view. X asked first about the telegr ph line between Mianeh and Tehran It was still out of order. I then said that, having bwon able to hear^ n thing in Tabriz about the situation in Mi&amp;neh except vague and al&amp;rmi rumours I had come to see for myself, and could he tell me what had happened ? He gave me promptly what 1 suppose is the official Russian version: the people being ex sperated at the tyr *.nn:us rule of the gendarmes and a few oppressive landlords, ©d obtained arms and turned the gendarmes out of office and 'avenged themselves' on a few bad landlords - but only on those who had acted badly. He himself had warned the peo£&gt;le that there must be no disorder in the town, and in luct there had been none. As regards the villages, he believed there haa been some fighting there, but there had been none whatever in the town, nor had any attempt been made to turn out the other Persian authorities and officials. The Mayor (Baki.shdar) was in his place and working, the department of Finance and the police were working norxaally; the shops, the bazaer and the Ratio nil Bank Branch were open, and bread was being b ked normally. The train to and from Tehran was also running enquired, on behalf of the Superior of Tabriz, about the Soeur VisitXatrice xnvember 13th. to catch the train. The her, but supposed that she would have SCth. according to its timetable. I the French Catholic mission at v.ho hsa left Tabriz by road on Town Commandsint had no news of left by the train on November 6 . I called next on Mr. Falaki, the manager of t-^e Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company’s depot. He told me that he and everyone else of the merchant ana professional class in the town was very frightened. He certainly looked it - but that may have been dread of the interview with the Town Commandant which would certainly take place after iay departure. He informed me that four people had been killed in the to-fli when the gendarmerie were disarmed on November 17th.: an officer of gendarmerie, the chief accountant of the department of Fhance and t o other people. I gathered, however, that there had be^n nothing like a battle in the town: these four seem to have been isolated murders. He believed that there had ben fighting in some of the villages and that a number of gendarmes and land-owners had been killed. The local committee of the Democratic Tarty we^c in complete control of the town. They were commanueering transport and haa held up, among other lorries, ten which were under contract to the A.I.u.C. and were an route for Kermanahah. He had had no com^unication with Tehran for a week. 7. The Democrat Committee, the manager told me, had taken over a Persian army store, kept in Mianeh for the equipment of conscripts, and had begun to clothe trir armed bands with the uniforms. The soidiers I had seen in the town were conscripts who had been assembled at Mianeh, the collecting centre, from various villages of Azerbaijan ready for transfer to x ehran. The committee was sending them back to their villages and were commandeering private lorries, without payment, for this purpose. This was confirmed from my own observation, and from my interpreter’s overhearing of conversations going on outside. The manager finally said that the committee had respected the Company’s property so far, and were paying for the petrol they took. 8 • I calleu on the Acting Baknshdar, *ajid Ihsani. The Bakhshdar himself hai removed to Tehran a week bet ore tne trouble began. M.

Immediately afterwards they had re-armed thirteen /ofCOPY 66 3/26o/A-12/4 5 . British Con^ul^te-Oeneral, Tabriz. November 23ru, 19 4 5* ft ^r Sir Reader), A Deputation of the Azerbaijan National Congress called on me this morning and hanoed me a copy of the Congress* s Declaration, asking that I would have it transmitted to the British Foreign Secretary. I enclose copies of the French version which was handed to me together with the Turki ana Persian ones. The spokesman of the Deputation was Ghulam Reza liliami, the fomer Mayor of Tabriz, whom I know fairly well. I told him I would send on the Declaration to you, but bin not know when I should have an opportunity of doing so; I coula not telegraph it, since there was no line to Tehran, ana I was not sure whether in the uncertain state of security on the road it was proper for me to send the Vice-Consul and the Consular car and risk a regrettable incident. This being translated to the other two members of the Deputa tion, they declared that they had no connection with the village coinmittees who were holaing up travellers. They returned a studied vagueness to my uestions about what was going on, but were full of protestations of their respect and admiration for the great and democratic British imp ire. Among the confusion of conmittees ana names of committees, I seem at present to discern some such pattern as tuis: The Party is organized in town and village coinmitteess these committees have sent representatives to an 'Azerbaijan National Assembly* which has sat in Tabriz from Nov. 19 th to 21st. , and also calls itself * Constituent Assembly*; this Assembly has elected a Committee of Thirty hine, whose task is to organize the election of bhe Provincial Council (Anjuman lyalati or, in the Declaration - Parlement National). From the Arijuman lyalati will apparently be chosen an executive which will be, in effect, the local, autonomous overment of tais province, and will be responsible to the Anjuman lyalati. The Committee of Thirty 1 ine (Azerbaijan wlilli Hai'ati) will also organize the elections of the Azerbaijan deputies for the Majlis in Tehran. Notices signed by the chairman of the Committee of Thirty Nine (Ali Suabistary) have been posted to-day saying that notices for the election of ueputies to the Anjuman lyalati will be posted in all parts of Azerbaijan from the 1st to the 4th Azar: (Nov. 22nd to Nov. 2^tl) Three days later voting will begin and must be finished by 12th Azar (Dec. 3rd). I have not seen the Persian Conananuant here since my trip to Mianeh yesterday, but X feel that this plan of the Party can be carried out without serious opposition here; the gendarmerie all over the province fell at one blow on Nov. ^tii-l?^* after very litole if any resistance: the stories of fierce battles are in my opinion pure fantasy. I think the Persian General here will bow to force majeure (represented by the long look in the Russian General's eye) and the Anjuman lyalati can take over the administration of this province as soon as it is ready. The local land-owners, big merchants and Iranian officials protest that all this is a purely Russian manoeuvre, as, I suppose, do the Iranian Goverrment in Teiiran. while it is of course, inconceivable that the movement coula have succeedea without Russian sympathy and support, ana while the uussians no aoubt accord their support purely for their own ends, I cannot help observing that there is among the workers ana peasants of this province what has always seemeu to me /ar f ps&amp; -2~ a genuine exasperation v^ith the incompetence ^no corruption oi the Iranian Government as represented ha?e, am that there ' miseries and injustices which in many another country woulo De sufficient to produce a spontaneous movement of revolt. 1 oo nou believe that the Russians have pre-fabricated the whole movement: it seems to me rather Jiat they are exploiting a genuine revolutionsy Situation: they may have stiffened the peasants with Muhajirs, out the peasants themselves have gone to the work with a will. 11 may express an opinion on a matter which no doubt goes xar beyond my competence, I would say that a more liberal and inteLtigen solution of the present crisis should be sought than merely requesting the Russians to allow the Central Government to impose its previous regime on this province by sending Persian troops here, for 1 t ^ntc that the common people of this province are determined to nave no more of the succession of futile and dishonest Governors ana officials who have hitherto ruled them, and putting the matter at its lowest evaluation, if a part of Iran must inevitably be governed by knaves and fools, the people of Azerbaijan have made up minds that their native candidates can fill these roles as well those from Tehran.

Before I left mianeh 1 called again on the Soviet Town Commandant and asked him to help in obtaining the release of the A.I.C.d* lorries detained oy the committee. Be said lie would do what he could, but the committee acted on instructions from Tabriz, and as some of the lorries were carrying merchandise, the export of which from Azerbaijan was pronibited by the committee, he was doubtful whether he could do anything. I asked that he would explain the position ol these lorries to the committee and try to secure the release of the empty ones at least* I remarked that he probably knew the cnairman oi the comaittee, at which he bridled a little and said he was not acquainted with him, oat being Town Commandant, he had a certain authority 10 * In ord-r to reach Tabriz again before the night was far advanced I had to leave Mianeh before three in the afternoon. I was passed through the Democrat pickets on the uay back very promptly and cheerfu lly excep: at Bustanabad. Here, in the dark, I was ueld up for about ( ten minutes, while various members of the committee (as I suppose) came and peered at me, and the only one possessing a rifle kept the weapon pointed in a determined fashion st the bonnet of my car. None of this party appeared to speak itussian. I informed the Russian soldiers at the check post on the way out of Bustanabad that the Acting Vice-Consul would be passing through on November 24th., in the same car, ana said I hoped there would be no hold up. They assured me there would not. I nad also taken the opportunity to inform the Tom Commandant at Mianeh and the picket at Turkman Chai of the Vice-Consul’s proposed journey. 11. My conclusion is, that while the violence of the movement in kianeh and the villages has been mich exaggerated, the Democrat Party really mean business* The Tehran Govexuimsnt have no authority whatsoever between Mianeh and Tabriz, and I feel coniident that the Democrat Party is similarly in control in every town and village of Eastern Azerbaijan. A cle n sweep has been made of the gendarmerie, and the opportunity has been taken to liquidate a number of landlords obnoxious to the Democrats. Drder is being kept and the structure of Persian local Government (except for the gendarmerie) has been left intact, but the authority inspiring the structure is that of the local committees, what has happened in Mianeh will happen I feel sure, on a bigger scale within the next week in Tabriz, and an Autonomous Azerbaijan will have coiue into being.

Leading article in the Gumhurlyet regarded revolt as more significant than any ordinary disorders since Russia hoped to exploit it in the interests of her imperialist policy. Since Russia was a totalitarian country like Germany, Italy and Japan, she would follow their paths. Today there were only two nations who could oppose her, Britain and the United States. ^ Whether they would pursue the same lenient policy tov/ards Russia as they did towards the Axis and thus prepare a third world war was a question worthy of speculation. 5. Aksam article over Sadak’s signature declared that continued occupation of Persia had been absolutely unnecessary since the cessation of Allied supplies. ’Worst sxill, the Persian Government which had had faith in Allied promises, was now being subjected to Russian provocation. The present unjustifiable and most pitiful state of Persia was in every respect the responsibility of the Great Powers. 4. Baban in Tasvir said that Russia, through agency of Communist Parties abroad, had opened an offensive on all fronts, as events in France, Bulgaria and Roumania bore witness. Russia and the Anglo-Saxon powers had pledged themselves not to infringe the independence and integrity of Persia. The present situation proved that Russia had not fulfilled her pledge, and althpugh she might disclaim responsibility for the present position it would be difficult to make the Allies believe such a statement. n * Yalcin in Haber article after recalling the Anglo-Soviet .treaty declared that that unfortunate country had learnt oy bitter ex § e ^ ence k° w great and terrible was the distance between words and deeds.

Ab/iS/p ' FILE GOPV indzxed Sir, The news of and the reports that the Rus*ians have prevented the despatch of Persian military reinforcements to the disaffected area have created something like consternation in Afghan official circles* On the 20th November, the day the news broke in Kabul, at a dinner party at the French Legation I noticed the Persian Charge d’affaires in constant grave conclave with the Turkish Ambassador, the Iraq and Egyptian Ministers and the Afghan Foreign Minister* All, except the Egyptian Minister, seemed thoroughly depressed* It was a curious coincidence that this dinner party should have included the leading local representatives of the countries which signed the Saadabad Pact in 1937- Egypt was not, of course, a signatory, but the Egyptian Minister was evidently coopted for discussion on this occasion* EXT 65,1 9^5 'kHhtr SECRET• British Legation, Kabul. 34th November 1945* e revolt in the Azerbaijan Province of Persia &lt;pr' 2* The following morning I happened to have an interview with the Afghan Foreign Minister. His Excellency at once referred to the Persian situation and said his Government regarded the happen- -ings tnere with the gravest misgiving. They could not believe it was a spontaneous rising of oppressed people against their Government and felt sure that the whole affair was stage-managed by the Russians, either to evade evacuation of the country by March in accordance with their undertakings, or to retain control of Northern Persia through a puppet Government of their own choice. He thought a further possible motive might be to give the Turks an object lesson and so frighten them into complying with Russian demands for an outlet to the Mediterranean. He added that the Turkish Ambassador inclined to this theory. Ali Muhammad went on to say that the Russian attitude in the recent Meshed mutiny and in this latest incident was further evidence, .if indeed any were needed, that Russia did not Intend to cooperate /with the other Allied Governments in respecting the rights and sovereignty of small nations* 3* In regard to the Middle Eastern countries he said that the Russian Ambassador here had been sounding him at various times about the present day attitude of the signatories of the .saadabad Pact. Did they all intend to adhere to the Pact or to make a new one, possibly including the Levant States and Egypt? His Excellency thought that the object of these enquiries was to ascertain whether the Muslim countries of the Middle East intended to form a solid ,T bloc M against Russian aggression. %(•? 4* In reference to the Russian Ambassador at Kabul he said that he had noticed that whenever anything of importance occurred in the Middle East in which Russia was concerned, M.Bakoulin invariably either proceeded bn tour or kept as far away as impossible from the Afghan Foreign Office, presumably to avoid \|answering awkwara questionsl For example, he had now asked for facilities to gmke an extensive tour of Northern Afghanistan (Kataghan and Badakshan) ostensibly on a fishing trip. The Afghan Government had reluctantly agreed to the visit but doubted very much whether the real object was fishing, who would fish at this time of the year in the north where it was bitterly cold and travelling involved much personal discomfort? Ris Excellency thought it much more likely that M.Bakouiin was going away until the Azerbaijan business blew over; and he had chosen the North because that was the part of Afghanistan the Russians were most interested ini In general, His Excellency was most depressed and said that if this was the way Russia was going on it was high time all the ’’decent” people in the Middle East ’’held themselves alert”. ——*— i BCCEu P®L KPT..-V 5.

Following is summary of note presented to Soviet Embassy in Tehran on November 17th by Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, A number of Kurds in Fourth Province (i.e. western part of Azerbaijan including Re zaieh) and Mah[grp. undec. ? aba]d area have been actively engaged in obtaining arms and ammunition by various means so as to threaten Persian integrity. 2o Leaders of the Kurds have obtained a printing machine and a lot of newsprint for their purposes from the Soviet. 5. A number of Kurdish chiefs, without going through the lawful procedure have gone to Bakur and returned. 4. Mullah Mustapha Barzani who^has fled from Iraq, and come to Persia now resides with his men in Kurdish districts and being irmed has created a state of disorder and confusion in the Fourth Province (western section of Azerbaijan). 5. The going and returning of ordinary travellers from Tehran to northern provinces is being controlled and inspected by vSoviet officials, no admission being granted without inspection on the part of the latter. 6 0 Transportation of foodstuffs from the northern provinces to the capital and southern areas has been stopped and as a result prices have gone up while peasants in northern provinces through lack of a market for their produce are in distress. 7* Maintenance of order and security in northern provinces is jeopardised for lack of garrison forces; it is on the other hand impossible t.o reinforce the troops already on the spot owing to the fact that the sending of even one gendarme requires sanction of the Soviet authorities and this entails such protracted formalities that the object in view is defeated before anything can be done.. «8 * Ir/ith no Governop-G-eneral and local governors in the northern provinces the administration is disturbed# Meanwhile obstacles are placed in the way of Persian officials who attempt to proceed to their respective posts to fulfil their duties# 9. On the Persian-Turkish border Persian officials are unable to exercise vigilance and make their authority felt because they are deprived of all freedom of action. 10. Due^to interference on the part of Russian officials, the prosecution of individuals in the northern provinces has been rendered difficult. This Soviet attitude is in direct viola- tion of Persia's jurisdictional freedom. The Russians are sending into exile those whom they do not favour and by pre venting the punishment of seditious elements, they have created a state of unrest and confusion. . Moreover they have not allowed reinforcements to be sent in time to the localities where their presence was urgently required. The following are some of the reports received to date: (a) On the night of Aban .23 (November 14th) a number of villagers affiliated to the so-called Democratic party met in a locality situated at a distance of twelve kilometres from Mianeh. Some 50 of them were armed and these men blocked the road to two army trucks, beat a warrant officer in the truck disrobed him and then held meetings and afterwards took possession of Mianeh, disarmed all local gendarmes end railway guards then took possession of G-overnment offices, interning all Government officials. (b) Kabiri (a local magnate closely in touch with Soviet officials) has distributed arms and munitions to a large number of people in Maragheh. In Adjabchj.r gendarmes have been surrounded, arrested and deprived of their weapons, being after wards cast into gaol. In Qolikadi the constabulary had arrested a number of insurgents and brought them to Maragheh but Russian officials interfered and insisted that they be set at liberty because they were Communists. Kabiri actively engaged in gathering men and arming them, is making preparations to attack Maragheh. Arms and ammunition are being distributed amongst me libers of so-called Democratic party in Sarab. Aimed groups pretending to take part in meetings want to go to Sarab and occupy Government offices. (c) Reports received from Tabriz state that Russian officials prevent the police from guarding prisons; meanwhile members of ’‘Democratic party” are allowed freedom to engage in arming the people and inciting them to create disorder. Representations to Soviet officials on the spot do not giv° fruitful and positive results. The same situation prevails in Khoy, Makou and Rezayieh.- 5 - Such being the state of things and anxiety of the Government instructions have been issued to departments concerned to send out as soon as possible Governor General and Governors as well as other officials to posts which have hitherto remained vacant for reason already specified* At the same time orders have been given for the despatch of troops and gendarmes in suffi cient numbers to cope with the situation and re-establish order and tranquillity* \ Consequently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs request the Soviet Government who as a signatory of the Tripartite Treaty^ of Alliance (January 29th 1942) undertook to respect territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Persia and to abstain from disturbing the administration and the freedom of the forces of Persia and economic life of the country to issue the necessary immediate instructions to the Soviet military authorities enjoining upon them to refrain from interfering with the freedom of action of the Persian Army and constabulary* If urgent attention is not paid to these matters the situation in northern regions is such that disastrous consequences might ensue which most certainly will be contrary to the wishes of the two governments and to the expressed desire of U.S.S.R* to consoli date their relations with Persia* Should the Persian Government not succeed in preventing unfortunate incidents owing to the lack of freedom of movement of its armed forces it will have the right of imputing responsibility for this failure to Soviet military authorities. In conclusion the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs the Soviet Embassy that the Persian G-overnment has decided to send for the moment two infantry battalions, one light tank battalion, and one gendarme battalion with arms and ammunition from Tehran to Mianeh and Tabriz via Ghazvin and Eanjan* It is requested that the Soviet authorities be notified of these decisions at the earliest possible moment so that they might be informed of the matter in advance.SECRET COPY With the Compliment® of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affair* /- • / J QjPot /O /) Z 7 4 91761 AON 8 2 [This telegram is of particular secre'Cy and should he retained by the authorised recipient sfnd not passed on] [CYPHER] i&gt; w FROM W Earl of Halifax No, 7770 illst November, 1945, r : - - 0 i I &lt; iCABI NET DISTRlfeUTION )f 46 FORMGN OFFICE D, 10,4:2 p,m, 21st November 1945 R. 5,40 a,m, 22nd November 1945 Repeated to Tehran* 4 4 4 Persian Ambassador called on me on November 20th and left with me summary, contained in my immediately following telegram, of a note presented to the Soviet Embassy Tehran by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He dwelt at some length on ‘the gravity of the situation of Azerbaijan and on its implications not only for Persian independence but also for British interests in the Middle East and for the interests of all peace-loving nations in an orderly world. The orders issued by Persian Government as reported in [grp,undec. ? Soviet representative^] note would auickly provide an acid test of Russian intentions. He had little doubt that while the Russians would be unwilling openlv'to break undertaking to withdraw their troops by March 2na, it was in their mind to create such a situation in Azeroaijan before that date arrived that stage would be set for incorporation of Persian province of Azerbaijan in the U.S.S.R. by means of infiltration, disturbances and other pressures. 2, He hoped that both the United States Government and His Majesty’s Government Y/ould bring all possible influence and pressure to bear on the Soviet Government before it was too late, and had no doubt that his Persian colleague in London was representing this necessity to you with all urgency. He made concrete suggestion that from Persian point of view, the situation would be assisted if all troops could be withdrawn from Persia as quickly as possible before the Soviet Government had had time to complete their infiltration and disturb plans under cover of their present occupation. 5. By way of giving me general background he had a good deal to say about enlightened policy being followed by the present Shah; danger of events m Azerbaijan being used'to stimulate disturbances and trouble in Kurdistan; artificial nature of disturbances in Azerbaijan which was naturally the most loyal province in Persia; and much else. 4 . I told him I had no doubt that you fully appreciated the importance of present events and would be devoting much attention to them; and I undertook to transmit to you what he had said. / 2 4NOV'&lt;U£; j '/NO: A .’•fip.pI OTP• -r-O f* [This telegram retained by tl: E xr 6443 • &amp; is of particul 4 r secrecy and should be e apt^r^^ed recipient and not passed on]. ns*** •*--•***} [CYPHER] CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir R.

The Shah said he had been hard at work with the new Minister of Finance on a series of reforms though whether irresponsible [sic] deputies could be induced to pass them into law was uncertain and unfortunately, the constitution did y 1 permit of his dissolving the Majlis and^holding tresh elections. Once foreign troops had left, the constitution of OS must receive attention. I mentioned Provincials, and the Shah said he had already told the Prime Minister that this was one of the essential reforms. The Shah informed me that Qawam A1 Saltana (see my telegram No. 1320 paragraph i.) h L d suddenly returned to Tehran from his aatatel in the Soviet zone.

Gendarmerie have ceased to count as they have been over powered, disarmed, or rendered innocuous. Persian Government attempted to send reinforcements of two battalions (totalling 600) and one Gendarmerie battalion 300 strong. Soviet authorities have never disclosed what is the total of their forces in Azerbaijan but according to estimate of the Military Attache and his staff, there has for some time past never been less than about 30,000 Soviet troops (including an armoured formation) in this same area.

To make sure I induced the Prime Minister to say that he would reiterate the orders published abroad and would issue the text here. He is however very tired and slew and it might be well to press the Persian Ambassador in London to publish the note if it has not already appeared, since it apparently contains threats to increase the Soviet forces in Persia'. 2. The Prime Minister summoned the Soviet Chargd d*Affaires but the latter said that he could do nothing but refer to the Soviet note. When the Prime Minister said the Persian Government must insist on its right to send its forces wherever it considered they were needed the Charge d’Affaires said that he must communicate this to the Soviet G-eneral Officer Commanding^ 3. The Persian Government released two or three days ago, because their health was alleged to have suffered from a hunger strike, several men who were arrested at the time of the disorders under the late Government. More newspapers have also been released mostly left extremist in character. 4. There is naturally great anxiety and confusion amongst deputies and other important persons. I am frequently asked for advice but I can only point to the British and American approach to the Soviet Government and urge that the Persian Government should receive full support while the crisis is on..

He had concentrated mainly upon the Soviet refusal to allow Persian troops to enter che province. Dekanozov took the line that, if the Persians increased their troops there then it would be necessary for the Russians to do the same, if only-to prevent disorders arising out of conflicts between the government troops and the local inhabitants. The Persian Ambassador is seeing Dekanozov again today to protest against the re installation of telephones and other equipment in Tehran by the Red Army who had apparently stopped their evacuation of the capital. « 2. The Persian Ambassador said that so far as he knew, there was no question of any Persian mission coming'‘to Moscow^ now, as recently stated on the B.B.C. This would, in his opinion, be a mistake in present circumstances. While he thought that the oil question might be at the bottom of Soviet policy the Russians were still carefully avoiding making any suggestions themselves for improving Soviet-Persian relations. They took the line that it was for the Persians to put forward any proposals. Foreign Office please pass to Tehran and Washington as my telegrams Nos.169 and 732 respectively.

Whether the Persian Government can ideal with this problem alone is, I fear, doubtful but I have no doubt at all that to treat the province of Azerbaijan as an isolated problem is to play into the hands of the Russians. There is no question (as you suggest towards the end of your telegram) of trying to extend to the whole country the extreme programme of Azerbaijan. On the contrary my proposal is to reduce the Azerbaijan question to its rightful proportions by treating it as one of local government not of autonomy, and that can best perhaps only- be done by introducing into all provinces system of limited local government which is long overdue. Moreover the Persian Government would then be out doing the Azerbaijan dissidents themselves for independence. The latter are right in basing demand for a provincial council on the constitution, but wrong in electing their council when the Central Government has not passed the necessary law governing elections, and powers and duties' of the Council.- 2. ’I do not think many who know the Persians from inside would agree that my plan would tend to disintegration._ Persia is disintegrating all the time because of over-centralization, which’leads to complete stagnation in provinces. Generally speaking Tehran takes no notice of provinces until one of them breaks out into disorder. Trouble in Azerbaijan could never have obtained the present proportion without Russia instigation and help, but the province has genuine grievances which might well have caused a revolt sooner or later against the 21 af&amp;m nMo /corruptcorrupt ^nd inefficient^ ofXici^l§, sent from Tehran, All ^ revenue of, the,'country is sucked into^ehran, 7 and what 'Is left' wh^,n 'army'and gendarm 6 rip^ have heen^paid^for^is plainly spent •on' ministries, which &lt;fo / little'and ^employ'three time^ as many'' officials as would be Required 'even if^they^idlnuch.' iDvery—■* • little flatter ^in the 'provinces ‘ is deferred to'Tehran ^and ^ Ministries are^hokodA/ith^unanswered reguests Tor 'Instructions/' Even the mayors of 'provincial downs' are 'sent-f rom' Tehran/^ My six J^ars 'experience'iiere' 1 ias'cpnvinced He that^greedy Hind ^— short-Highted 'as Host'Persian’s 'are,^provincial ^notableg&gt; 6 f ten ^ have 'strong'local^pride/and patriotism^Which could be’ utilised on 'local Councils. &lt;[f some proportion of-^evenue Raised'fronr each province '^Supplemented from Central ^exchequer'tfhe re the' province''is &lt; poor-e. g. eh the^ersian GulfJ-^puld be^retained in the province 'and Expended *by-provincial 'council-on ^suoh Things as^secondary Poads 'and preventiveTSedicinej^ersiaHnight 'Begin—* to 'look up^^ 3. ^ Similarly, I consider that it is safer to treat the language*puestion,^md 'Such Hat ters ^as 'employment of ''local - people'H.n'local ^official /p'osts,^as'^ffecting &amp;ll Hinorities'^nd not Azerbaijan/^lone^Tt 'submit 'that anything i/hich 'ad tit's 'even^ by'implication tliatAzerbaijan Is llnique^in'Persia is aPtep^- towards Annexation by thefKUSsians,.

Begins. Dear Mr. Molotov I have been instructed by my Government to inform you that they are disturbed to learn that certain armed forces which the Persian Government wished to send from Tehran to the province of Azerbaijan have been stopped on the way by the Soviet military authorities. 2. It seems to my Government entirely reasonable that the Persian Government should wish to maintain order in their own territory, and legitimate that they should move their security fierces about their own country in order to do so. In accordance with Article 1 of the Treaty Alliance between the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and Persia of January 29th 191.2 the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are pledged “to respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Persia'; and Article l of the same treaty lays down that the presence of Allied forces on Persian territory “does not constitute a military occupation and will disturb as little as possible the administration and security forces of Persia'. # Moreover in the Three-Power declaration concerning Persia issued at Tehran on December 1 st 191.5 the Governments of the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and the United States expressed their desire for the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Persia. 5. My Government^therefore feel that the action of the Soviet military authorities in stopping Persian forces on their way to Azerbaijan must be due to some misunderstanding of the position. My Government trust that the Soviet Government will feel able to instruct their commander in Persia not to obstruct^ the movement of Persian forces or to interfere with the Persian Government in the exercise of their sovereign right of maintaining order in their own territory.

This is exactly what he said to me recently so I think^ the report must be true. Some informants said that he criticised us for our alleged support of Saed Zia. 5. If this is the line that Mr. Murray has taken in his reports to the State Department, the interest of United States Grovernment in the fate of Persia may have been damped down.

National Congress of Azerbaijan appeals to the Persian Government and Democratic powers of United States, Great Britain, Russia, France and China and sets forth its iust demands (1) Azerbaijan Nation in virtue of its nationality (? race) language and traditions has a right to autonomy within the framework of the independence and integrity of Persia according to the Atlantic Charter. (2) No intention of basing claims on division of Persia or prejudice to her frontier. 13) The democratic regime [grp undec demands]. (i) Azerbaijan will participate in Central Government by sending Deputies and paying fair share of taxes. (5) (Unintelligible something omitted) ( 6 ) National Parliament to be elected with a responsible government composed of members of that body. (7) Azerbaijan language to be used in Government offices and taught in all schools. ( 8 ) National Congress has elected Committee of 39 to negotiate with proper authorities and organise elections for National Parliament and for central Majlis. 3. Conclusion declares desire to attain aims by peaceful means unless the central Government tries to trample on legitimate rights. The National Committee has full authority to negotiate for the autonomy of Azerbaijan provided that it does nothing against territorial integrity and independence of Persia. The Persian authorities and Democratic powers are asked to afford their gracious help. Foreign Office please pass to Washington as my. telegram No 114.

I suggest we take the following line: ( 1 ) to allow any such fundamental change to come about while foreign troops are in Persia would be a violation of „ . . joint and several undertakings given by Great Britain and Russia in Treaty of 19k2 and a base return for the services rendered by our Persian ally. (2) Elections held while the Russian troops are in Azerbaijan and are blocking the roads to that province would not inspire general confidence* (3) Azerbaijan is not the only province which feels itself neglected. Provincial councils which are common forms in most countries are provided for in principle in the Persian constitution though the complementary legislation has not yet been passed. (l.) By bringing their troops into Persia using her means of communication and causing inflation of her currency by their heavy spending, Great Britain, Russia and United States have involuntarily contributed to the present chaos and consequently they owe a duty to Persia to assist her to put her [gp. undec. ? house] in order.

It says that in recent weeks elections to local organs of self-government have^been taking place in towns and villages of Northern Persia, and that broad sections of population have been participating. Azerbaijanians who form majority of popu- laticm had no opportunity until recently of having schools m their own language, or of publishing their own books and papers, and it was therefore natural that during elections there was great^support for demands for teaching in Azerbaijanian as weil as^Persian, lor establishment of law courts using Azerbaijanian, for election of town and district organs of self-government, and for other democratic measures conforming to national hopes of local Azerbaijanian population. • • ?*. claims thatal.l sections of local population joined in Democratic movement and that great success was achieved by Democratic Party of Persian Azerbaijan, which enjoys support of great part of local inhabitants who are strivmg for elementary democratic rights and national develop ment within framework of Persian state. But although this movement has no separatist aims, local police sometimes used re P r ession against local population under pretext of combatting separatists. More reactionary local landowners support this police repression and a number of incidents have taken place in various districts such as Sovab and Mian - ln + g t ° araied attacks by police and by reactionary bands on most active members of Democratic movement. 3. Ax tide goes on to attack certain organs of British press particularly Reuter for describing events in Northern Persia in completely wrong light. It also says that in receno days B.B.C. has repeatedly talked of a separatist ri ^ in ? Northern Persia and of clashes with police, and that all kinds of slanderous stories have been put out about Russian lorries supplying local inhabitants with rifles and machine guns.

If this movement continues it seems likely to lead to the secession of Azerbaijan. Without wishing to be alarmist, I cannot help thinking that the Russians are playing the same game in Persia as they have been doing in Bulgaria and other^ countries in the Balkans and that we may soon be faced with the same sort of fait accompli in Persia. The effect on ‘Turkey may be imagined. In fact present Russian policy in North Persia may well be aimed at Turke 2 ^. I do not want this to happen and the only way to prevent it is to make the Russians realise that what they are doing in North Persia is creating suspicion here and in the United States. An objective statement in the House of Commons would expose the Russian manoeuvre but it woula have to be confined to facts. f'oU.Aj' /t*! JL \ 2. It seems to me that the right course for^the Persian Government now is to send troops to restore the situation in Azerbaijan without asking Russian permission to do so. The Russians may stop them in v/hich case it would be for the Persian Government to protest and make the protest and the reason for it known. We should then have facts. 3 3, It now appears from your telegram No. 127M that Persian Government have requested permission to send troops. If this request is not granted, the Persian Government should equally make this fact known.

Adam’s visit would be to get into direct touch with M. Litvinov, relations between the Soviet and Iranian Governments having recently, as I have already reported, been somewhat difficult. 2. His Excellency said that the Soviet Government appeared to have persuaded themselves that the Iranian Government—who desired nothing but good for everyone—had been lending themselves to “machinations” against So\ let interests. I bus the Russians regarded the German civil air service, via Iran, which at present terminates at Kabul, as part of a German-Japanese plan to reduce soviet influence in Asia. 1 he Russians also seemed to be persuading themselves that the improvements to the port of Pahlavi, which are being carried out by German engineers, may affect the position in the Caspian, and they had made the demonstration reported in my telegram No^ 97 of_ the 23rd August. I here were also, M. Jam said, a number of boundary questions outstanding, ana no progress was being made towards their settlement. o. It is, of course, obvious^ that the attitude of the Soviet Government in these matteis arises from their hostility to the German commercial penetration of Iran. They are likely to go on teasing the Iranians as long as Iran’s commercial dependence on Germany continues to increase. As the Russian market is essential to Iran, the Soviet Government are in a strong position, and, while I do not wish to belittle M. Adam’s powers of persuasion, it mav be doubted whether he will find a very responsive listener in M. Litvinov. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad.

Iranian Government who maintain that article refers only to persons in the employment of port administration have offered to accept arbitration on the point at issue but Soviet Government decline.

My Lord, Tehran, May 20, 1938. I HAVE the honour to report that during the last fortnight I have on two occasions had what is becoming increasingly rare and difficult, that is, a conversa tion with an intelligent well-informed Iranian, not a Minister and not a member a confidential talk. None the less, what this person, who holds an important commercial position in Tehran, said to me seems of sufficient interest to be worth transmitting to you. 2. On both occasions he referred to relations between Iran and Soviet Kussia as being almost dangerously bad, though by this he did not mean danger of war ; he was satisfied that Soviet Russia had its hands full elsewhere and had no aggressive designs. But the Soviet Government were making no secret of the fact that they were much disturbed at the control that Germany was being allowed to acquire over Iranian trade and industry. The Soviet Government had done what they could; they had offered credits; if Iran did not desire the type of machinery, &amp;c., produced in Russia, these credits could be used for purchases from other countries, not Germany. 3. The Soviet Government held that in other spheres too they had followed up the good-neighbourliness they had previously shown Iran; they had demonstrated that they did not wish to interfere in Iran s internal affairs by recently withdrawing all their consulates, except that at Pahlavi, by not replacing their military attache at the Soviet Embassy, and so on. 4. My informant thought that the recent great increases in German commercial activity and in the numbers of German residents and visitors (residents, including ex-Austrians, have now reached 1,300), had given the Soviet genuine grounds for anxiety, and that they were now putting on the screw as they did about every three years in connexion with the renewal of the Irano- Soviet Commercial Treaty which falls due this year. Possibly the present mass expulsions of Iranians in Soviet Russia, reported in my despatch No. 19/ of the 19th May, represent a turn or two of the screw. 5. My informant continued that the Shah was disturbed at the state of Irano-Soviet relations, and he believed that M. Soheily, who knows Russia and speaks Russian, was being recalled to assist in securing an improvement. It is a fact that a new Iranian Minister, M. Said, who was until recently Minister in Rome and who, as reported in my despatch No. 136 of the 7th April, has an excellent knowledge of Russian, has now been sent to Moscow as Ambassador. 6. My informant believed that Soviet influence here was now very small. There are, indeed, some minor indications of the Soviet Embassy trying to re\i\e it. Last week the Soviet Ambassador sent out invitations to a propaganda film, “ Peter the Great,” at the Soviet consulate. I was present and saw a good many Iranians, including a few officers who will have had permission to attend. The photography of the film was excellent and the film itself and the letter-press explaining it, as may readily be imagined, suggested sympathy with the patriotic and westernising policies of the Shah. 7. My Iranian informant told me that he had thought it prudent not to attend the showing of this film, and in that connexion adverted to the prohibition that is virtually imposed on even non-official Iranians against visiting foreign missions in Tehran. He had consulted a highly-placed friend in the police as lO what his own line should be : he was told that the police had a man outside eac n foreign mission who noted visitors as well as a spy or spies among the employees or personal servants, and that, foolish or at least exaggerated as the whole thing was. it was better for him not to visit. He had, in fact, on one occasion entertained PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3478/281/34] Copy No. ^ 9 Mr. Butler to Viscount Halifax.—(Received June 13.) of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Circumstances were quite unfavourable to [339 n—2]2 the German wife of an Iranian, her husband and her German father. Next day, his friend in the police had rung him up and told him that the Germans in question were anti-Nazi, that they were watched by the‘German Gestapo, who had noted and reported his party to the Iranian police. Unfortunately, the Shah was an admirer of Herr Hitler! 8. My informant made some further remarks about internal affairs. Like / ^ s all those with whom I have recently talked, he is pessimistic at the present situation, economic as well as financial; there is no planning and no check on over-spending on ill-judged projects, and he foresees no change in this while His Imperial Majesty remains alive and controlling the situation. Hitherto, His Imperial Majesty had had the support of the merchant community, who remember that he crushed not only the country “ barons,” but the city “ barons ” too, like the Qharagozlus of Hamadan, who had excessive control of the cities; and the merchants had been doing tolerably well lately by investing in the Government and semi-Government companies. But the increasing weight of taxation and the deteriorating condition of many of the Government companies was having its efiect on the sentiment of the merchant community. The intelligentsia were definitely being held down, and over 150 students were in prison in Tehran. 9. My informant shared the general disappointment at the way the Valiahd was developing; he did not anticipate a Communist regime in Iran, but he did think that the next form of Government would be a strongly leftward form of democracy. 10. The above are the views given me by a patriotic and Nationalist Iranian. I will comment only on his last point. The view generally held here is that the Shah's effective support is the army, and that the army will determine the form of Government that succeeds him. This seems probable. Whoever secures the support of the army may, or may not, wish to secure also civilian and political support from some quarter. There would not, I think, at present be any unanimous feeling among my colleagues here that in this contingency the army leaders would seek it from the democratic left. 11.

Sir, In accordance with the instructions con tained in para. 56 of Chapter V of the Consular Instructions) I hawe the honour to report that the Consulate of U. S. b. k« in Kermanshah was cloeed on or about the 26th Instant, on which date the furniture, a:c. on the Consulate premises was sold by auction and the archives removed to Tehran. 2. There can be little doubt but that the boviet Consulate here has been a centre of Soviet propa ganda and that, until about 1956 - when it must have been realised that further efforts to win over Iranian sympathies to Soviet ways of thought were doomed to failure and might just as well be abandoned - the Iranian local Authorities were justified in regarding the Soviet consulate as a potential source of danger which required careful sur veillance. 3 , . For a considerable time past the Iranian local Authorities would appear to have succeeded in frustrating the efforts of the Soviet Consulate to under mine confidence in or loyalty to the present rd^ixne in Iran. The result has been attained by watching closelyall persona visiting the Soviet Consulate and 'making things unpleasant' for individuals who frequented the ooviet Con sulate without very good reason. By succeeding completely in isolating the Soviet Consular officers lor some time past the local authorities can certainly claim to have prevented the Soviet Consulate from having much contact with Iranians, especially disgruntled persons here who have reasons - valid or otherwise - for disliking the present hah*s rdgime and who might have been responsive to boviet advances, 4 . as there are no boviet rvussinn interests in this part of Iran and the absence of any Russian colonies here (which might at least have furnished so*ae raison d'etre for the Consulate} resulted in the Soviet Consul leading the life of a complete recluse latterly, it is not surprising that the Soviet Government should at length have decided to close down the Aermunshah Consulate which, for a long time past, must have ceased to be of much utility, 5 # The local authorities here havs tended to 3udge all Consulates after the Soviet model and to suspeot this Consulate also of intriguing much in the same way as the Soviet Consulate did. It is, of course, not surprising that many Iranians should still feel some doubts regarding the attitude of this Consulate, for it is not very long since British Government representatives in Iran intervened in local affairs; indeed the memory of humilia tions endured in the past has by no means been eflacea in thethe* minds of the local population. It ia unfortunate , however, that the local Authorities have so far seemed to toe unable or unwilling to appreciate the present friendly attitude of this Consulate, It is to toe hoped that the closing of the Soviet Consulate, with the sus picions and unhappy memories it has evoked in the past may perhaps pave the way to a franker and more reasonable attitude on the part of the local Authorities here towards this Consulate, 6 , I have sent copy of this despatch to His Majesty's minister at Tehran (Ho, 16).

Now that Kemal Ataturk will not, according to report, visit Iran before next year, there is not the same urgency to have all men hatted and women unveiled. Nevertheless, the authorities are moving on steadily with their programme. Despite vague rumours of slight trouble, said to have been quashed by numerous arrests, in Ardebil about the 20th August, the hat question is already past history in Azerbaijan, and attention is turning to veils. On the 6th August, celebrated as Constitution Day, the Governor-General read publicly a message from the Shah in which he thanked Azerbaijan for its loyal compliance with his wishes. The citizens of Tabriz replied that his wishes were to them the commands of a god. One must make allowances for oriental exaggeration, but, even so the fact remains that the Shah has this province grovelling at his feet. There is no one in sight who would dare to oppose him, and unless something very unexpected happens, this formerly fanatical city of Tabriz will be among the first of the provincial cities to unveil its women. The first move was made by the Governor-General on the 15th August, when he summoned the leading merchants and reminded them that the Shah desired that the women of Iran should unveil; he suggested that they ought accordingly to prepare their families for the change. Then on the 20th the Director of Education summoned the women teachers, gave them tea • • •tea and told them to unveil. They did so, and faced a curious hut quiet crowd as they left. Since then individual women teachers have been spat upon and had bad fruit thrown at them, but the police will doubtless put an end to that quite easily. Meantime, it is remarked that these teachers, who have had to unveil to keep their jobs, are get ing no support from the wives of officials and merchants as yet. It is taken for granted that they will all have to comply quite soon, but for the moment there is a hesitancy, each man watching his neighbour. Local G-overnment . The Department of Finance produced two scandals in August. A dismissed employee denounced the chief of his branch, and it was found that this official was collecting, and giving receipts for, amounts in excess of legal taxes, while he accounted only for the legal amounts in his books. Receipts were called in and discrepancies amounting to tens of thousands of rials were traced. In the second case a collector of taxes, having apparently created difficulties for a landowner in the neighbourhood of Tabriz, offered to remove them for a payment of 1,000 rials. The landowner agreed to pay, but meantime denounced the collector to the police,who lay in concealment while the transaction took place and arrested him at the end of it. These are ordinary enough events. The interest lies in comment offered in connexion with them. It is said that five years ago, while the Shah was still popularly regarded as a righter of wrongs and a pillar of uprightness, officials feared to be caught in dishonesty lest they be hanged. These two latest culprits, however, took no special precautions in their dishonesty, and although they have been sent to Tehran, it isnot expected that they will suffer any very drastic or lasting disgrace, because the whole Administration is similarly dishonest, or so at least the people believe* They also believe that His Majesty is one of the richest men in the world to-day. Education . A project is on foot to establish a medical school at Tabriz at a cost of 60,000 rials. Arrangements had been made to begin co-education of boys and girls in a primary school near Julfa, but it now appears that for some reason the experiment will not be made. It was reported in last month* s diary that the Department of Education might purchase the remaining American Mission properties at Rezaieh. The deal has now been completed and the authorities have acquired for 300,000 rials one house, a hospital building (to be used as a dormitory), a large garden, &amp;c. The Americans consider that these were worth 400,000 rials, but are pleased, on the whole, to have been able to liquidate. Military Affairs . It appears that work on the new aerodrome is held up for the time being for lack of money. The hangars are well advanced but four at least still lack roofs. Section B.2.

In the town of Tabriz itself, and possibly talk °i f tbe larger centres, the smarter uniforms, the better streets, the Ik of officials do inspire the feeling that Persia is getting somewhere, and new actones are taking over some of the unemployed carpet-weavers; but the we f g hiVL aS P ° 0r aS r er * f T lm g i8 ’ S ° [t is said ’ that the Shah started well, but has gone aside oft the highroad of the country’s welfare in pursuit of personal whimsies. The expenditure of so much money on the railway is resented heie pei haps more bitterly than elsewhere, since the trade of Tabriz must progressively suffer fi-om the opening of these new routes. It is no exaggeration to say that people are literally groaning under the burden of taxation, often made heaviei than it ought to be by the arbitrary assessments of harsh officials especially in the matter of income tax. The town is full of the murmurinffs of discontent discreet but definite; there is no leader to give it direction, nor is ? n y^k e ly to arise so long as the strong hand of Government is felt everywhere* but there is gloomy talk of what may ensue “ if anything happens ” to the Shah before his son is strong enough to follow on. There is in Tabriz a public garden which was a cemetery before the present regime converted it to be a setting for a statue of the Shah. This promises to be the Bastille of Tabriz if, unhappily the Central Government loses control. The common people are represented as muttering to each other that they will one day make a cemetery of it again. I here must be a section of the people which realises, however, that all this pessimism may well be dissipated by the return of better trade conditions by the gradual realisation of the immense benefits conferred on the country as a whole by better roads and the establishment of security, and the Crown Prince’s arrival at manhood within the lifetime of his father, as there is every reason to hope and expect that he will do; but, as usual with strong men, the Shah has pinned a great deal more than is safe, so far as Azerbaiian at any rate is concerned, on his own life. Friday prayer in the mosques here has been abandoned except by some of the lesser mullahs. It is stated that the Government has authorised one muitahid to resume. J ^* Elections. Of twenty Deputies to the Majlis from Azerbaijan, it is thought that thirteen or fourteen of those now sitting are viewed with favour in Tehran and that they will accordingly be returned. Four vacancies have been caused by death, three in Tabriz and one in Ardabil. At least one Deputy has fallen into disgrace, viz., Mirza Jawad Khan Imami (Khoi and Shapur) Who is now proved to have been implicated, so the report runs, in the Tehran sugar scandal, the details of which are doubtless better known to His Majesty’s Legation than to this consulate. The names of Mirza Murtaza Khan Amin, Hadji Muhammad Riza Ardabili, Hadji Nizamet Dowlah, Ma azizi Sultan have been mentioned as definitely in the running for the Tabriz vacancies, with Mirza Jaafar Ishpha-hani, mentioned in Tabriz despatch No. 6 to His Majesty’s Legation, as a doubtful starter.

Since then the entire mission station here has watched eyeiy move o t authorities with a nervous intensity, fearing that every fresh instiiK ion develop into a calculated application of the pressure which forced them out ol Eezaieh, hoping that it won’t. Their primary schools here have been closed in the course of the campaign of Persianisation, and their secondary boys school for example, has been reduced to forty or fifty pupils, a fraction of its normal complementcourse of January detectives made a descent on a Friday class, rather of a religious character, conducted by a lady missionary ; she was summoned to explain, and warned that she must not conduct religious propaganda^ The hefjd of the boys’ school, about the same time, received orders that all f i ida\ actmtie. must cease and the gates be locked. He has represented that thm order cannot be obeyed, since boarders must pass out and in, and boys must use the Paying fields on Fridays or not at all. The question arises whether these interventions indicate the beginning of a campaign against the mission with the object of rendering work, already difficult, completely impossible, or are merely signs of generate i n Rezaieh, Muhammad Khan Nisari, who applied the pressure on the mission there, is now second in command in Tabriz, under Colone Seif whose office he is said to covet. Colonel Seif has visited America, and is generally thought to be of a reasonable and tolerant disposition. It is feaied by the Americans that Colonel Nisari may seek to prove his a pure Persia, and therefore his greater fitness to be chief of police, by harassing the mission here.( p.z.

(cony of Legation despatch No.463 of November 1st to the Foreign Office) I have the honour to report that nothing much has been heard of the self-styled 'National Organisation of Azerbaijan” since the Elections this year. 2. This apocryphal 'Organisation' was really merely another manifestation of Soviet intrigue; and, beyond the printing of a Manifesto (by the gelatine process) signed with this specious name, has not come into the open at all. 3. This manifesto was one of the contributory causes to the later embargo on the sale of gelatine. B. As Mr.Acting Consul Davis reported at the time the 'Elections' were a mere farce, and they would probably have been so more or less even without the above manifesto. The deputies were virtually preordained from Tehran, and only about 6000 voters appear to have thought it worth the trouble of going to the Foils at all. I have, etc., (Sd.) STANHOPE PALMER, H.

Situation in /jgerbald.lan . Sir, I have the honour to report that there has been con siderable discontent expressed herewith the Kxchange taws and the Import Monopoly Law. 2. Bolshevik propagandists have seized the opportunity thus offered to sow their seed in receptive soil. 3. After the propagandist notices at Novrua which - as already reported - resulted in the arrest of 2 or 3 Armenians and Persians connected with Russian trade Organisations, Seifullah IBRAHIMOFF - the head of the Baku G.P.U. - arrived hire on May 21st and is staying at the Jrand-Hotel. This Hotel which has a Loud-Speaker giving out news from Tiflis in the Turk! dialect, is the usual headquarters here of Bolshevik birds of passage. IBRAHIMOFF had been nominated as a Russian expert for the anti-locust campaign in the Kughan, and appears to have employed his tour there to disseminate Bolshevik or at least rebellious ideas among the Shahaevan tribes. His arrival coincided with another dispersal of Bol shevik proclamations and leaflets which occurred on May 22nd. 4. Even the fanatical religious element of Tabriz appears not unlikely to play into the hands - though unwittingly of the pro-Bolsheviks. The latter urge the religious element to insist upon their Moharrem processions: while the Police break 3ir R.H. Clive, K.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc#, H.B.M. Legation, Teheran.break these up unmercifully, as a procession on May 22nd opposed Police orders to disperse, 20 of the ring-leaders were arrested. At other processions on the J3rd and 24th - also broken up - some of the demonstrators sang words to the effect that: 'Those who break up religious meetings must inevitably be punished'. 5. There is no vestige of popularity remaining here, I believe, for the Shah; and one can only hope that if he really does visit I'&amp;bris this year, as is rumoured, there may be no similar incident to thfit which marked Mussolini’s visit to Bologna in 1927. 6 . A military agent here apparently thought he had dis covered some evidence of the existence of a plan to make a con certed pro-Bolshevik rising on May £4th and whether this be the true reason or not a few military armed guards were placed in certain quarters of the town and around the military centres. Yesterday (May 25th) these small pickets were confined to the vicinity of the barracks and military depots only. 7. As if to coincide with the above situation news spread on May 24th, that there had been fairly severe fighting between Persian troops and Persian and Turkish Kurds at Kara-Eini and AGH GOL, spots near little Ararat; in which the Persians had had 120 Persian and 4 Armenian soldiers and officers killed. On May 25th there was a further strong rumour that the Kurds had actually been able to seize MAKU itself. 8 . At about 10 A.M. yesterday three military biplanes flying in close V formation pacsed over this building on their way from Teheran to the new Military Aerodrome. One landed atonce, while the others circled over the town, thus causing the impression that there were five of them. These 3 planes left at 7.16 to-day in the direction of Haku, after again circling over the town. 9 . I am also told that becau e of the state of unrest in the town (but in my opinion also because the last readily available troops 500 in number had already been sent from here to Mcku last week) it is not now considered 8afe ,t to send any more troops there from here at present. X may add here that last week some peasants were attacked on the road here from Sofian; S were killed and their carpets (for sale) and money stolen. The assailants escaped and have not been traced. 10. Several weeks ago the Turkish Consul-General told me that the Turkish plan of campaign against the Kurds would be totally different this year. Last year they had insisted on the Persians holding their frontier to prevent fugitives crossing into Persia'and re organizing there for fresh exploits. This year, on the contrary, the Turks proposed to drive the Kurds into Persian territory - which was less mountainous and where the Kurds could be more easily rounded up' - while the Turks would hold their side of the frontier to prevent the Kurds 1 return. 11. This programme, if both parties willlngly and loyally cooperated, would no doubt be excellent; but from ria Bey s manner X certainly gathered that the Turks would act as above If It happened to suit them - whether the Persians acquiesced i n advance or not. 12. It is obvious that the Persian Conscript Army of the North West is hardly up to the task thus inflicted on it at intervalsintervals not of its own selection, and it would also seem fairly probable that the Persians’ consequent moments of military embarrassments are deliberately calculated so as to coincide with probable anti-dynastic manifestations such as these religious processions of Moharrem; and are also marked by a most bare-faced recrudescence of Bolshevik propaganda. I am not sure, however, that there is cooperation between the Turks and Pussians; for each seems to be playing their own hand still. I have already reported the anti-dynastic placards affixed here at Novrus, and the return here of a well known Bolshevik agitator who is presumed to have brought the text of these proc lamations with him. Now Tbrahimoff, a leading light of the Baku G.P.U. is calmly residing at the Grand Rbtel here, after a tour of dubious nature among the hahsevan tribes. The^e latter tribes were presumably not over-pleased as it was at the prospect of having turbulent Jelali Kurds forcibly settled among them. 13. One can begin to understand why the Minister of the Interior All llansur said to me that he considered that this year H would be very difficult^. 14. Last year the Russians brought down a force variously estimated at from 2,400 to 4,000 men by night along the new Beku- Julfa railway and 'invaded' a section of Persia for 2-3 days. The Turks ’♦invaded' on their side at least once soon afterwards. This year the Turks have again 'invaded' at least once, and the Turkish Consulate General’s point of view is frankly that the Turks Intend to deal with the Xurds in their own way and pay notattention to little matters such as Frontiers and so forth. 15. Meanwhile the extreme N.V. angle of Persia is in courseof developing into a sort of pre-war Macedonia, f&gt;nd like Macedonia it will sooner or later give either Turkey or Russia a specious pretext for intervention - to protect their own frontiers, I cannot avoid forming the conclusion that there is an increasing tendency on the part of the Turks to adopt this attitude; for fear no doubt of being forestalled by the Russian more insidious methods of political propaganda; and I can only venture to presume that the sudden appointment of a Turkish Consul at Meshed is part of the not really at all new Turkish programme of a Pan-Turkish 'Bridfie’' between Aeia Minor and Turkestan. 16. The real Turkish attitude towards the Persians would appear to be one of veiled hostility. The actual Twrkish Consul-General is a very neat diplomat of the old type. He is outwardly extremely cordial and hospitable to everyone; but I have had occasion to report his immediate attempts to browbeat over a question of etiquette first the new Military General and then the new Civilian Governor-Genural within a few days of their arrival - attempts in which I politely but absolutely refused to participate, deapite ingenious endeavours to work upon ray presumed Amour-i'ropre in order to enlist my support. I must, however, add that I have noticed an increase of coolness between Zia Bey and the Russian Consul-General, and now feel sure that the Russians did not relish the Turks at once copying their M invasion* idea, but regarded the Turkish actions with uneasiness and jealousy. Further Zia Bey has always insisted whenever possible upon his position as Doyen. I have not objected to this at all - except in the two specific cases above and in one or two other minor cases where Zia Bey has tactfully given way at once - but I think I have noticed@ Sv noticed symptoms of increasing reetlvenass under these leading-strings on the part of the Russian* He has taken for instance on certain occasions to not making his official calls at the same time as arranged by all the other Consuls. It is diverting to study this little conflict of interests and prestige; more especially as it might seem to represent the only silver lining to the cloud hanging over the Persian N*W. Salient - and even much of /serbaidjan. 16. I venture to think under these circumstances that it is advisable that X postpone my first tour towards Urmia, Sauj-Bulak and Pawandua until after my Reception on the King's Birthday. T had already arranged that during my entire absence, a Policeman be placed on night duty inside the Consulate garden, ^his idea was not prompted, however, by fear of a rising here; but from my study of Aghabegoff’s Revelations and the fact that there have been several cases of ordinary burglary here due to distress and unemployment. 17. I may add moreover that after one single bright day (on May SSnd) there have been fierce storms and further torrential rains, such as will have rendered nearly all the minor main roads very difficult Indeed to negotiate for some days to come. May 26th, 1931. Later 18. The nevrs from the ’ r aku zone continues to be very dis quieting, but the rumour that Maku itself had been taken has been modified. It is now said that the Kurds have only seized villages close to Maku. 19. arhang Kalb-Ali Khan, commander of the 1 st Tabriz Tib, left hurriedly for Maku at midday yesterday - so that the 500 men sent off in lorries last week no doubt belonged to this Tib. 20. No more troops have been sent there now, however, as therethere are none to spare. 81. A Lorry of medicines and another of stretchers was also despatched towards Maku yesterday, while other lorries were commandeered for the despatch there of food and ammunition. 82. Severe fighting Is reported to continue near Maku. Apparently about 600 Turkish Kurds were driven across the frontier by the Turks, the latter now holding the frontier and pos ibly having once again advanced a little way into i eraia. The Persians, making a virtue of necessity, attacked them and there have been considerable losses on both sides. The 3 aeroplanes left at 7.15 A.M. to-day in tha Maku direction. It is not known whether they have brought small bombs or not: but it is believed that upon their arrival a further Persian attack will develop. But the weather again changed for the worse at about 3 P.M. when there was a miniature cloud-buret with severe hail for an hour. Tuch changeable weather may interfere with air operations. 83. Ibrahimoff, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, and another 'Locust Expert* - who is believed to have been at one time Head of Erivan Prison - left at mid-day for Bilasavar. While here these men had a police escort - ostensibly to protect them from possible reprisals by refugees. There seems, however, to be still some doubt as to these men’s real names. The infiltration of Bolshevik Agents into the -tughan, Kara- Dagh and Ardabil zones has grown very pronounced. 84. To sum up, I cannot seriously believe that the situation at Maku need cause any special alarm; but, as the Military Authorities themselves still seem very perturbed and as the weather remains hopeless, I do not propose to start upon ray tours till after ray Reception on June 3rd.

The Russians having failed to stop progress upon the Rawanduz Route had concentrated with increased energy upon the Baku-Julfa Railway. This should be finished by the Spring of 1931. 2. Meanwhile they had abandoned further developments towards Lenkoran though there was nothing to prevent them resuming development work in this direction later on. 3. No work was being done around Shusha, and the zone south of this was still too unsettled to allow of construction activities, even if they were contemp lated. 4. Persian organization in the direction of the Moghan steppe was almost non-existent ; there not even being telegraph lines laid in this direction. He had pointed this defect out to the Shah, and it would shortly be remedied. 5. From Tabriz to Julfa was still absolutely vulnerable, and there was noth ing to prevent the Russians carrying out their threats (in June) of running their armoured trains over the Julfa bridge right down to Tabriz. Only about 26 tourih^xaTS Uxt^iil~Ye2(d ; a good many cars and lorries, however, pass through it on their way between Kerman and Isfahan. It is estimated that about 150 cars and trucks garage at Yezd during a month. Efforts have been made to obtain a British tyre agency for a local merchant; although it is true that at present importation into Persia is, owing to exchange difficulties, fraught with great danger and risk, yet tyres of some sort are needed by the market and if the merchant does not obtain the British agency he will presumably get an American one. 6. Anglo-Persian Company .—The arrangements for retailing the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the vicinity of Yezd are as follows :— There is an office at Isfahan which sells petrol and Kerosene. At Nain and Yezd thera is an agent who sells the same. At Arjanoon (ten miles beyond Aghda, between the latter and Yezd) and at Aghda the Company’s agent at Ardakan has a subagent working for him selling petrol. Prices in Yezd are II krans per shah man for petrol and 8 per shah man for kerosene. The petrol market at Yozd has improved considerably since the opening of the motor ropfe from Bandar Abbas. The kerosene market at Yezd is largely influenced by importations by local merchants of the Russian kerosene from Shahru^f the Russians have also an agency in Tezd for the sale of petrol and kerosen^, but the Anglo-Persian Oil Company holds a sufficient share of the trade to control prices at a reasonable figure. 7. A small sketch map is attached. 16. He had, therefore, asked permission to organise a line of defences in and around Marand, and hoped he would he allowed to start work upon this next spring. 7. By the end of 1931. the Azerbaijan Army should hare been increased to 40,000 men. He hoped that he would be given the means to equip them in a modern way, and make them into a force likely to inspire respect from their northern and western neighbours. 8. He had raised a cavalry regiment in the Mishkin District, and this was to form the nucleus of an eventual entire cavalry Division. 9. He had also insisted upon an increase of the artillery. 10. The position was that the only road fit for heavy wheeled traffic in the north-western part of Azerbaijan was the road from Astara to Ardebil. The rest of the roads were difficult to use, and easily defensible. 11. On the other hand the coastal road from Astara to Biku would lend itself to a “ Coup de main ” upon Baku and the oilfields by an eventual Mishkin Cavalry Division. 12. He believed that if the Russians brought 100,000 men down to the Persian front in Azerbaijan, they would have to deal with renewed revolts in the Caucasus and could not drive in the frant of a well equipped Persian force of 40,000 men posted in previously prepared defensive positions. 13. The creation of such a potentially respectable force would enable Persia to negotiate upon better terms with both her neighbours; and, as the activities of the Musawat party in the Erivan Province had already created friction between Russia and Turkey, and as Turkey, was jealous of all Russian ide*s of expansion in this direction, he did not dispair of seeing Turkey recede from any entente with Russia as to the partitioning of Azerbaijan. 14. When the above defensive preparations had been completed, he would welcome being sent as Ambassador or temporary special envoy to Angora to discuss the whole situation. Note. —Personally I venture to consider General Zafer Dauleh would be an admirable selection in every way. 15. He devoutly hoped that the Rawanduz Route would be open to lorries— even as a temporary track—by next spring. There was a general inclination here to use it in absolute preference to the Julfa-Batum route. 16. My wife and I accepted the General’s invitation to a farewel party t o be offered by him and the Garrison on November 12th to Colonel Husameddin Bey upon the latter’s relinquishing his duties as Turkish Liaison Officer with the Persian N.

Tehran, July 1, 1930. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 107.) Tabriz, June 18, 1930. I HAVE the honour to report that the general returned here from Ahar unexpectedly on the 14th June. 2. Mrs. McGrath—accompanied by Mr. Binns, but not by me or my clerks interviewed him on the 15th. 3. I saw him alone on the 16th, and he dined here yesterday (17th), while I shall see him again about the 21st, if he returns by then from another visit to the frontiers. 4. The general says that his representatives on the frontier have continued relations with the Russian Frontier Commissars. These latter, as well as the consul-general here and Minister at Tehran, had demanded the arrest of certain refugee leaders. 5. These had long been arrested or kept here under open arrest; and the Russians were informed of this, yet omitted to inform Moscow—this although the Russian Commissary at Khudafirin had thanked the Persian there. 6. The raid was avowedly made to arrest these persons—who naturally could not be found, as they were all in Tabriz. 7. The Russians used collapsible boats; and surprised the block-houses by enticing the men—mostly asleep—outside upon pretext of discussing an urgent case of smuggling. They were arrested half-dressed and unarmed; but later all were released. The Persian officer arrested was also released. 8. Ghahraman Khan was seized as he had been a Soviet agent, and had not given satisfaction lately. He has now died in prison in Russia it is reported by poison ; as being a Persian subject, it was considered unwise to shoot him. 9. The Russians advanced only from one point inland and swept the zone already reported. They contented themselves with seizing the block-houses and villages on the river necessary to preserve the raiding cavalry from an attack from either flank. 10. The Russian G.P.U., who directed the raid, returned to Baku, while most of the troops have withdrawn—to take part in the repression work in the Zangizur district, especially towards Mighry and Sobi. 11. Continual artillery fire can be heard from Bilasuar in the Kara Dagh opposite the above districts; and this has, perhaps, given rise to a rumour here that the Russians have raided Bilasuar. 12. Practically all the hostages taken have been released. Perhaps a dozen persons have been definitely carried off, including one or two of the Russians own spies who had been suspected of double-dealing; and some minor refugee notables. 13. The general is pushing forward the disarmament and arrest of refugees in the Kara Dagh; and having them sent here. [174 k—6]14. About twenty such persons were marched into Tabriz yesterday. 15. The general added that a Caucasian refugee named Zifikar Bey resisted the Russian raiders. He killed one officer and three soldiers; and was himself wounded. He escaped and is at present in hiding somewhere in the Kara Dagh. 16. A report from another source declares that the electric light is not turned on now at nightfall in Russian Julfa, and that under cover of darkness the Russians are fortifying this spot. ^ I have, &amp;c. STANHOPE PALMER. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 110. Very Confidential.) &amp;ir, Tabriz, June 20, 1930. I HAVE the honour to report that the Soviets are now making overtures to the rebels in the Caucasus highlands, and asking them to lay down their arms and return home. 2. The reply appears to have been a flat refusal unless the policy of nationalisation of land and livestock be completely dropped. 3. The Russians have, I am told, about 8,000 troops in the Nakchevan zone, 5,000 to 6.000 in the Zangizur zone and 40,000 at a spot near the junction of the Baku-Julfa and Baku-Tiflis Railways, called Yevlak. 4. In the region of Nakchevan the armed rebels are said to number 3.000; while it would now appear likely that the 1,500 rebel refugees from this district, who had fled to Mount Ararat, have returned to the Nakchevan district before the Turkish attack on Mount Ararat begun. 5. At least one refugee chief—Kerbalay Mohamed, sonA of Shahsuvar Bey of Nakchevan—received warning of the intended Turkish attack on Ararat. He crossed into Persia with 200 followers about ten days ago, and, after a stay of four or five days, crossed into the Nakchevan district and joined the rebels there. 6. Frequent small attacks are made on the railway and railway guards by the rebels, and one attempt has been made to wreck one of the two armoured trains. . 7. Fighting is continuous in Zangizur and there appear to be desertions from the Soviet troops to the rebels. 8. I hear that the Russians have asked at Tehran for the recall of Zafer Dauleh. From the selfish point of view—of obtaining early authentic news—I can only say that I devoutly hope that the Russian request will meet with no success. 9. The general considers that the Aznaft Bureaux which exist now in various strategic or frontier posts, such as Ahar, do very little commercial business and are merely G.P.U. centres. He declares to me that the reports from the Aznaft offices gave (perhaps deliberatelv) wrong information leading up to the Russian raid. 10. The Armenian archbishop confirmed to me that the Russians were ostensibly looking for three refugee chiefs—although it was common knowledge here that these men had long been sent to Tabriz. One was Sultanoff. 11. On the other hand. I am told from a different source that the Russians hoped to surprise also one—Beg Pirimoff. an Armenian who was a colonel in the Russian armv during the war. Lately he had been acting as factor of the Toumanian family’s property in the Kara Dagh. and had also sent in men to pillage in Russia. He was not found by the Russians, but the burning of Toumanian’s villa and burning of certain crops, &amp;c.. is now more easy to be understood. 12. The general also reported to me that a socialistic organisation had been introduced among the porters at Persian Julfa, and the members began to wear distinctive badges. As their numbers rapidly increased, he gave orders for these badges to be removed. 13. The archbishop confirmed the words of the Amir Alam to Mrs. McGrath, and my own quite independent conclusion, that the Persians are supporting the Kurds in Mount Ararat. But he added that the Turks had a finger in the Russian raid on the Kara Dagh, which drew off to the Ahar zone troops which were already being marched towards Maku.3 14. Mrs. McGrath was refused a visa to even transit Russia, unless she signe&lt; an undertaking not to write upon the Russian situation at all. She would not do this, and the general has made all arrangements for her h leave to-day via Rowanduz. 15. I understand she will go on to Mosul, Nisibin and Angora—to visi Mustafa Kemal. ^ It might seem rather regrettable that the Amir Alam should have been s&lt; indiscreet with her as to the Persian attitude towards the Kurds of Ararat in viev of her forthcoming visit to Angora I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a preliminary memorandum which attempts to analyse the actual situation in the Caucasus, Turkish Armenia, and such Kurdish zones as lie within, or are contiguous to, the frontiers of Azerbaijan. 2. These three zones are, at the present moment, inextricably bound together by common interests or through temporarily successful outside intrigue. I have, &amp;c. STANHOPE PALMER. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum on the Situation across the Northern and Western Frontiers of Azerbaijan. Caucasus. A SERIOUS attempt was made to organise a general revolution against the Soviet system, and the mainspring of the movement was in the North Caucasus— Baku and Daghestan. The plan was to start the revolt in the North Caucasus—not in the south—and work progressively southwards till the River Araxes was reached. This purely national movement, which I will call “ A,” was almost, if not quite, independent of “ B,” the “ Musavat ” movement fostered from Turkey. Several Turkish officers entered the Caucasus within the last few months upon propagandist missions; and it is believed by many that the Nookly revolt (see below) may have been led, or at least provoked, by such Turkish emissaries. The “ Musavat ” movement has apparently lost ground recently, and Caucasian Moslems are not at all inclined at present to favour annexation to Turkey; but now only desire an independent Caucasian Republic. 2. The northern revolutionary group are alleged to have planned their rising for April. But the Soviets had already begun to enforce their system of nationalising land, crops and live-stock, and had for the first time believed themselves strong enough to apply this regime to the Mahometans of the Caucasus. [147 aa—9] B3. One of the “ A ” leaders visited the Nakchevan district for propagandist work; but his visit had the unintended result that the local impatience was fanned into premature flame, and three villages openly mutinied before the revolt had started in the North Caucasus. 4. This quite upset the carefully-laid plans of the northern group and ^is suicidal for the villages concerned. They all lay close to, or within striking dist;He of, the Julfa-Tiflis Railway. Two armoured trains and troops were hurried down and the villages shelled out of existence. Some of the inhabitants, however, escaped, to the hills to the north and, being armed, now constitute one of the many bands to which I propose to allude in some detail below. 5. The above incident seems to have exploded the mine; but prematurely and in the wrong spot. The plan of a general rising had gone wrong; but it was too late to try and recast the whole scheme, as the warning had been given to the Soviets. Other districts then started to revolt at various intervals, instead of all more or less according to definite plan; and although there are at this moment probably between 20,000 and 30,000 armed rebels dotted about in the various fastnesses of the Caucasus, they are rarely more than a few hundred strong in any one zone instead of being more or less elastically-combined into one force under a common leader and staff, as had been the intention to bring about finally. 6. For the time being, at least, Moslems and Christians appear to be working together against the Soviets; while, on the other hand, Pan-Turkish propaganda seems to be out of favour completely. The Persians also would not seem disposed to give such Pan-Turkish propaganda much chance of recovering the lost ground. 7. At present it would seem that the Soviets have strong patrols along the Julfa-Tiflis Railway—which they are determined to keep open—as well as two armoured trains upon it. But their actual grip on the Caucasus seems to be confined to this railway and the coastal plains. The mountainous part of the Caucasus is quite out of their control at the moment, despite their attempts at surrounding particular bands of rebels, or attempting operations on a larger scale in a few particular spots. The use of “ mixed ” units has also proved disastrous to them, as the non- Russian elements often desert, and take even their guns and machine guns with them. 8. One prominent Cheka leader, Abbas Kuli Khan, attempted to reduce Buyek Vedi. This is a village upon almost impregnable heights, situated a little less than half-way from Nakchevan to Erivan. Many of the Cheka leader's men deserted to the rebels after killing him himself. Later, some of them succeeded in crossing into Persia, and at this moment three men are under open arrest at Tabriz upon suspicion of being deserters from this group of the Soviet forces. This, of course, upon the request of the Russian consul-general. Baku Zone. 9. In the case of Nookly—west of Baku and on the borders of Daghestan—the revolt started about the middle of May, and for some ten or twelve days the village remained in the hands of the rebels. A strong force was sent against them, and. when the rebels took to the hills, a circle was drawn round them. Part of the besieging troops, however, deserted to the rebels, with their rifles, ammunition, machine guns and cannon. The latest report is that active hostilities are still going on in this zone, and that these rebels have received some reinforcements from Daghestan. Kurdish Ora. 10. X district in Russian Azerbaijan (Baku zone), inhabited by a purely Kurdish stock which was transplanted there by Shah Abbas and later Shahs as a deliberate policy. Early in April they revolted under their leader, Sultanof, or Sultan Bey, the brother of the late Governor of the entire Kara Bagh District, Khoskov Bey. They killed many Government officials and expelled the rest, and have maintained themselves since against all efforts to subdue them. But there have been many who escaped later into Persia. Sultanof himself crossed into Persia and, using the Kara Dagh as a base, raided the adjoining Russian territory, at least once. It is reported to me that he encountered Russian troops on this occasion and that a running fight took place, which ended in Sultanof returning to the Karao • / Dagh. He is said to have been sent to Tabriz at the request of the Russian consul- general. It will be seen from this last item how and why the Kurds, even outside Russia, have become disposed to make common cause against the Caucasian Soviets. /\jgizur. 11. At the south-eastern corner of Mount Ararat there is a plain. I he mountain is in the Turkish territory, but the plain in Russian Armenia, from this plain a mountainous region runs eastwards to Zangizur, and this region has become a refuge for all the rebellious Tartars, Armenians and £ Sarasins (i.e., Lazos) of the vicinity. Guerilla warfare is being carried on Irom this base and raids made on any Soviet posts, no quarter being given to any of the Cheka or their adherents who are captured. The Soviets have not yet so much as ventured to make a serious attempt to repress this particular section. I gather that the country is more difficult than the Cyrenaican Jebel, and, moreover, similarly honey- combed—as is also part of Mount Ararat proper—with caves situated in the faces of precipitous cliffs, upon which guns cannot be trained. The Russians, however, seem to hope that this particular focus will exhaust itself. There appear to be many valleys which can be used for escape into Turkey or Persia, and many rebels appear to be, in fact, withdrawing by them. But on the 25th and 26th May a running fight took place near Meghry between a band of mounted Tartar refugees from this zone and Soviet troops. The Soviets lost two officers and twenty men killed—so I am told—while the refugees also suffered fairly severely. Another report says that the combined casualties to date are around 200. These refugees crossed the Araxes, and their leader is now in Tabriz. This incident caused still another protest by the Russian consul-general. 12. I venture to think that I have made it clear that no intelligible view of the situation can be given without going into the Turkish side of the situation. I feel the more justified as His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora has asked through His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for copies of my reports on the eastern corner of Anatolia. I quite agree that more news is likely to percolate in this direction than to penetrate the Turkish veil of censorship westwards and northwards of Erzerum. Turkish Ararat. 13. To recapitulate shortly : — The present Persian general for North-West Persia—Sartib Kafer Dauleh— quelled the Kurdish rising at Sauj Bulak in 1928. After the Shah s visit here, he was sent to interview a Turkish commission at Igdir, in Anatolia, at the foot of Mount Ararat. He is alleged to have seized this opportunity to establish friendly relations with the Turkish Kurds; while he himself told me he intended to handle the Persian Kurds very delicately and not disarm them at present. 14. In November 1929 it was decided that the Turco-Persian Boundary Com mission, which seemed to have reached a deadlock, should resume discussions in April 1930. There, however, appeared no possibility then or now of an agreement fully acceptable to both parties. There were acute disagreements, the chief point of discord being that each party desired the other to make the first step towards disarming such Kurdish tribes as were clearly within its own undisputed territory. This the general had no intention of doing, as already said. Neither side was willing to stir up a hornets’ nest, and nothing came of the discussions. 15. It would seem, moreover, that certain of the Turkish territorial claims would never be acceptable to the Persians, and that the latter, far from being in any hurry to resume the discussions this year, felt that they had everything to gain by continual postponement in the hope that time and political changes might make the Turks less exacting. 16. In any case, the general has spent several weeks this year in negotiating with the Kurds along the Turkish frontier, and he is even reported to me as having hinted that they would do well to resist any attempt of the Turks to disarm them. 17. Be that as it may, in April 1930 the Kurdish tribes of Mount Ararat made several attacks on Turkish outposts at or near Bayazid, Kara Kilisseh, and even [147 aa—9] b 9 mmt quite close to Erzerum. A strong force was sent against them, but failed in all three attempts to round them up. 18. The Turks were consequently themselves forced to postpone the resump tion of boundary negotiations till this month (June). 19. I am now told that the Turks near Maku have informed the general y^-t they intend to make a determined effort to exterminate the Kurdish rebels novW^n Mount Ararat, and asked the general to guard his frontier effectively and prevent refugees from there crossing into Persia. I will give what is known of the resulting new disposition of Persian troops at the end of this section of my report (paragraph 21). T r- n 20. The Kurds of Mount Ararat have their mam concentration at Kiralar. This is an almost inaccessible position, honeycombed with caves, situated in the faces of precipices, which can only be approached by goat-tracks or climbing, and upon which neither cannon nor machine guns can be trained, but where the defenders must be dislodged by hand grenades after an ascent during which the attackers would be exposed to a merciless fire without the possibility of making any effective replv The Turks failed at this very spot two years ago, and no one here—and probably least of all the general—believes that the Turks can succeed now either. The general has, however, acceded to the Turkish request, has gone himself to Maku. and sent considerable number of troops there. 21. The following dispositions have, therefore, been taken :— Yavar Fatullah Tohidi Khan was sent to Maku as commandant there some weeks back. From Tabriz one gurdan (i.e., 500 men) of infantry and six machine guns left for Maku on the 3rd June. 350 more men were sent from Sauj-Bulak, and there were already about 250 there. On the 17th May, 200 conscripts were sent to Sauj-Bulak from Maragha; while, on the 25th May, 130 conscripts were sent from Sarab to (so it was reported to me) Tehran. The present net dispositions along the Turkish frontier and at Tabriz are reported to me as about:— Tabriz : 1,200 infantry still here, and 400 cavalry. Sauj-Bulak : 800-1,000 still there. Urumia : 1,200. Khoi: 1,000. Salmas : 750. Maku: 1,100, or, according to another report, 1,250, and at least six machine guns. Conscripts have been gradually drafted in, and time-expired men gradually either disbanded or passed into the k Emnieh ” (gendarmerie). In this period of flux I cannot hope at present to obtain very accurate figures, but it is clear that there are much stronger forces along the Turkish than the Russian frontier. The Julfa garrison has only been slightly increased, and the Ardabil Regiment increased by recruits less disbandments. There should nominally be about sixty men at Julfa, and about 1,000 infantry and 400 cavalry in the Ardabil district. Khor H ussein Pashas Son. 21a. A further complication in the Mount Ararat problem is caused by the fact that the only surviving son of Khor Hussein Pasha has joined the Kurds there. Khor Hussein was implicated in Sheikh Sayyid's revolt of 1924-25. He himself who used to occupy the regions north-west of Lake Van—was detained in Angora, but escaped to Syria. He was killed with his three other sons later on when trying to re-enter Turkey. 22. The Turks would, therefore, seem to have to face a formidable band of malcontents, established in a much stronger position than the Jebel of Cyrenaica— which has proved too much for the Italians—and. under the leadership of a bitter enemy; malcontents who are certainly backed by Persian moral support, and possibly even supplied with Persian ammunition and such food as is not provided by nature. 23. Besides His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora, I am also sending copy of this report to His Majesty’s Residency at Bagdad, as I am also informed that a move-5 ment is on foot to claim autonomy (at first, if unavoidable, under a British mandate) for all the Kurds from Mount Ararat to the Hekkary [sic] District, described to me as the name for the zone bordering upon Iraq. . _ T . rp , • i 24.

I am told that, besides the main Baku-Julfa Railway, a branch is being built into the Ghapan portion of the Zengizur district to tap the rich copper mines there. These mines had long been exploited iy a rent company, but are now nationalised. , , ^ 26. My actual maps are of little help to me, where the Caucasus is concerned, and I am at present endeavouring to obtain Russian maps from Erivan. ^ 27 On the 5th June I received a code telegram from His Majesty s Residency at Bagdad asking me to control and report the movements of one Dmeley, who lett for Tabriz via Rowanduz and Riat on the 26th May. Dineley has an Iraqian passport, while his servant, Habibullah, was known to have an Iraqian passport and believed to hold an Afghan passport as well. Dineley’s conduct in Kurdish zones had aroused unfavourable comment. 28 I interviewed the police and the military, and found that Dineley, who had arrived here on the 2nd June, was still here. He has been placed under unobtrusive surveillance. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Consul Palmur to Sir R. Clive. (No. 97. Very Confidential.) t • 7 Q i&lt;j r labnz, June 8, 1930. ’ I HAVE the honour to report that I was told yesterday over the telephone that the general had unexpectedly returned from Maku at 2 a.m., and would leave for Ahar the next day. . . . , , . I therefore made an appointment at once, and had a long interview witn nun yesterday afternoon. n . . . . , 2. It was long before I could broach the subject of Dineley to him {cf. my memorandum in No. 96, paragraphs 27 and 28). 3. Dineley s actions will be closely watched in future, and at my request a report on his behaviour on the Persian side of the Rowanduz route will be obtained in due course from Sauj-Bulak. Dineley told the chief of the Tabriz police that he was &lt;T oing on a voyage through Russia, Siberia and the Tnited States. 4. °Much of what the general was extremely eager to tell me modifies certain statements in my No. 96—which had already been handed to my clerk to type. But the basic facts given in my No. 96 were confirmed by the general, and I am therefore leaving it as it stands, and merely adding the later details. The situation disclosed below is presumably only temporary. . . 5. There is no doubt whatever that the relations between Persia and Russia are about as tense as they can safely be. 6. The Russian consul-general has repeatedly demanded— • (a) The return of all refugees to Russia, without any discrimination whatever between transgressors of common law, brigands, political refugees, &amp;c. This the Persians refuse to agree to do, as they know such surrender usually ends in execution of the unfortunates concerned. (b) The removal of the Armenian archbishop, and his replacement by a nominee of the Archbishop of Tiflis (a mere Soviet puppet at present). (c) The dismissal of all Persian army officers of Caucasian origin in the North- Western Army. The Persians have refused or evaded replying to all three demands. 7. The Russians then threatened to follow refugees into Persian territory, using their own troops.i; % 8. The Persians then arrested five of the refugee rebel chiefs, including Sultanof, and the general assures me that they are all now in Tabriz. 9. The Russians next declared that the Persians were massing troops on their frontier, and that as they might go to war with Poland they would like to know what the Persian attitude would be in this case. Meanwhile, they pushed on work upon the Baku-Julfa Railway with feveri^ activity. t _ 10. The Persians replied that they had not more than 400 men, including customs officials and guards, along the whole Russian frontier. The general con firmed to me that he only had 60 men at Julfa and 150 at Astara, with about 800 at Ardabil and some cavalry. This agrees with my report No. 96. 11. He had, however, built a series of stone blockhouses along his side of the River A raxes, and these 400 men were dispersed in small batches of twenty to twenty-five men throughout these blockhouses. The Russians also objected to these blockhouses. 12. During the night of the 2nd-3rd June the Russians brought up a large force of troops, estimated to him at 2,500, in six trains (upon the new Baku-Juifa Railway), to a point opposite Khudafirin, i.e., in the Zengizur zone. 13. ' There is a bridge at this point, entirely in Persian territory, and he had built a new blockhouse at its southern end. 14. The Russian troops crossed this bridge and occupied Khudafirin, arrested the postmaster (released later), cut the telegraph and telephone wires, and retreated thirty hours later, taking with them six persons whom they had arrested as suspected of intriguing actively against them. 15. The general believes that some damage was done to the blockhouse or that there was an incident there, but he could get no definite news till the postmaster was released and made his way to the next telephone station. His first news came to him through villagers who had brought the news (probably garbled) to another post, and he had sent in other villagers to report upon the situation. 16. The postmaster’s version, when it finally reached him, caused him to return here from Maku. But he first gave orders to counter-march the 500 men from Tabriz destined for Maku; so he sent them eastward to occupy the two passes which are the only outlets from the rugged and mountainous forest behind Khudafirin. 17. He considered that Khudafirin w^as a most unlikely place for a serious invasion. The forest was on broken ground, the ' roads terrible, and the Shahsevan tribes had blood connexions with the tribes on the Russian side. They would certainly harass any advance through this forest, while his troops could hold the only two passes behind. 18. He admitted, however, that it would take him at least a week to concentrate- his available guns and machine-guns in any one spot. He was loath to “ show his hand ” prematurely as to his eventual plan of defence; and he could not make up his mind whether the above Russian aggression was merely by way of intimidation or whether it was in the nature of a test manoeuvre, i.e., to see whether it was possible to make a surprise descent upon Persian territory before any concentration could be made by the Persians to resist such surprise attacks; to test the working of the new railway, &amp;c. In that case the next descent might be elsewhere. 19. He added that there had been alarmist articles in the Baku and Batum press about the Rowanduz route, and that this route and the reorganisation of the Persian army were subjects of great preoccupation to Russia. He feared Russia might attack before either of the above was terminated. 20. He was beginning to think that a Russo-Persian clash was inevitable. It might be almost at once, or only when the Baku-Julfa Railway and branch road to Lenkoran were finished. He intended, however, after his return from the Ahar district in a few days’ time, to ask to go to Tehran to see the Shah and point out to him that a clash seemed bound to come, and that it would be better to start making all preparations for it at once. He had telegraphed direct to the Shah himself over the recent episode. 21. It was clear to me that the general was sincerely pessimistic about the future; and was convinced that the Russians were seeking to pick a quarrel. He added that he had had frequent demands for ammunition, hand grenades, &amp;c., from the rebels in Russia; but that, although smuggling would be easy at several points on the River Araxes, he had always refused to help the rebels in any way. He would not even now increase his display of troops on the actual south bank of the Araxes, although the Russians had recently much increased the guards on their side.» # 4 He might even withdraw his men from the Ahar region again before long; as it was not a vulnerable spot like Julfa or Astara, and therefore unlikely to be chosen for a serious attempt at invasion. 22. I gathered that he had very little artillery at his disposal at the moment, ^id I could see that my remarks upon this last point caused him uneasiness. 23. As I left I saw some infantry and some cavalry starting off. 1 imagine that, in all, 1,000-1,500 men will have been sent to the Ahar zone with several machine-guns, but that there is at the moment no great abundance of artillery of any f sort. Turkish Frontier. 24. The Frontier Commission is now fixed to meet on the 10th July. 25. The Turks had, in fact, concentrated a force to attack Kiralar in the Mount Ararat zone, but a military commission arrived and decided that it would need 50,000 to 60,000 men to effect any result. The idea was, therefore, abandoned; and the troops are now being withdrawn. 26. At the time of the Nakchevan incidents, the Turks made a strong concen tration of troops on their side of the bridge of Makari. Half of this bridge is Turkish and half Russian, while it opens upon the direct road to Erivan. The Russians asked for an explanation for this concentration, and the Turks withdrew their troops after they had been there four or five days. The general considered that there was some coolness between Turkey and Russia at the present moment. 27. To sum up, the general said that the Soviets had already completely destroyed several villages in the Caucasus and wiped out all the inhabitants whom they had been able to catch. But that they could not enter the real mountainous zone, where at least 12,000 and perhaps as many as 20.000 men were still in arms. He felt very nervous as to Russian intentions towards Persia, and believed that unless there was something else to occupy the Russians, such as either a general revolt of all the Caucasus, or a war with Poland, the Russians would, sooner or later, attack Azerbaijan. I have, &amp;c. STANHOPE PALMER. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Consul Palmer to Sir R. Clive. (No. 101. Confidential.) Sir, Tabriz, June 10, 1930. 1 HAVE the honour to confirm my report No. 97 as regards the Russian military raid. 2. Six hundred Russian cavalry crossed the Araxes at three points and disarmed the small guards (eight or ten men at each post) at three blockhouses at Khudafirin, Khomanlv and Ashghly. They took away the bolts of their rifles, and arrested their subaltern and sent him to Russia. Meanwhile, about 2,000 infantry with machine guns were manning the northern bank. 3. The telegraph and telephone wires were cut, and the postmasters tempo rarily arrested. 4. The cavalry then advanced about 30 kilom. inland. On reaching Voghan in the Kara Dagh they surrounded the villa of the rich Persian-Armenian Toumanian, which they aTleged’had been used as a base by refugees. Finding no suspects there, they burnt the villa and marched on to Vena, south-west of Voghan. Here they captured two refugee notables, whom they flogged almost to death and then despatched into Russia. The peasants of this district have evacuated their homes in panic, and some began to reach Tabriz on the 8th June. 5. There was some resistance shown in various spots. Human Bey, one of the refugee chiefs, was killed. 6. Other persons arrested and despatched to Russia were : Chanraman Khan a Shahsevan chief—and a Persian-Armenian notable of Vena named Babajan. The raiders then retired after a sojourn of over thirty hours in Persian territory. The exact number of casualties and of persons carried off is not yet known.7. The Persians were taken completely by surprise, and the menace of the new Baku-Julfa Railway line is dramatically proved. 8. In April Jibrail, chief of the Hekkarly Tartar tribe from the Russian bank of the Araxes, took refuge in Persia with 100 horsemen and several of their families. He left these families in the Kara Dagh, but sent back half his men into Russia— presumably to fetch other families. This party encountered Russian troops on [ 27th May and, as already reported, twenty Russian soldiers and two officers were killed and the Tartars retired fighting into Persia again. Presumably the Russian raid was to punish the above incident and also to try to round up the leaders of it. 9. Jibrail himself, however, had not remained in the Kara Dagh, but had come to Tabriz, where he and Sultan Bey Sultanof had actually called upon the Armenian Archbishop on Easter Sunday. 10. This call is considered here very significant, as previously while in Russia the Tartars would have nothing to do with the Armenians. 11. The Russian consul-general has summoned here his commercial representa tives from Julfa, Ahar and other frontier posts for a conference. 12 It is rumoured here that the Russian Minister at Tehran has apologised for the raid and promised the punishment of the Russian leaders. Even if true, no one here believes that this apology and promise are sincere. I have, &amp;c. STANHOPE PALMERTHIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. June 10, 1930. Section 7. £ /y E 3032/1734/34] No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 10.) (No. 241.) Gulhek, June 3, 1930. IN my despatch No. 147 of the 5th April I had the honour to report that Perso- Soviet relations were tending to deteriorate. In my telegram No. 134 of the 31st May; I stated that the Minister of Court had complained to me bitterly of the attitude of the Soviet Government, more especially in regard to their commercial policy. No progress whatever had been made, he said, in the negotiations for a commercial treaty to replace the treaty which had lapsed last October, and the Soviet authorities had not even replied to the counter-draft which had been sent them in January. There was one point in the Persian proposals which he knew it would be very difficult for the Soviet Government to agree to, but which was of vital importance to the Persians. While the Persian Government could not object to the Soviet system of trading only through Government agencies, however much they might dislike it, they were not going to allow these trade agencies in Persia to deal direct with the consumer, eliminating the Persian merchant altogether. Apart from purely com mercial considerations, this would mean simply opening the door to commercial propaganda. He had discussed this question with the merchants and they were prepared for the Government to go to any extreme rather than agree to this. What were the Russian products which Persia especially required ? They were sugar, mineral oil and cotton goods. Sugar could be obtained elsewhere from Belgium, France, or the Dutch Indies, although it would cost them about a penny a pound more. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company could increase their sales organisation in Persia and could supply all the oil that was required. England. Italy and other countries could furnish all the requirements in cotton goods. 2. Russian imports were not therefore vital to Persia, although he did not deny that, if Russia closed her frontiers to Persian goods, the northern provinces would suffer. He hoped much from the opening of the Rowanduz road with Iraq and. for the first time, admitted that the Duzdap Railway would be likely to become an increasingly valuable trade artery to India. He argued, however, that Russia definitely needed Persian cotton and. to a lesser extent, rice, hides and wool. He admitted that she could dispense with Persian dried fruits altogether and new markets would have to be found for fruit. . 3. But the present system could not continue, Russia was getting all she wanted from Persia and sending in return increasing quantities ot goods of third-rate importance, such as porcelain, ironware, &amp;c., which Persia could easily do without. 4. The Government had accordingly decided to introduce legislation whereby Persia would, in future, only import from countries with which she had no com mercial treaty goods to a value not greater than the value of the goods she exported to th&amp;t country. He £iclcl6(i thfit tins could in no crsg nffcct Grcnt Britain, &amp;S fill tho Persian oil went there. I asked if the Government had weighed the consequences of such a policy. He said thev had and that His Majesty was entirely in favour of it If drastic action was not taken now they would be forced to take it in a year s time when the position would be worse. His Nlajesty desired peace and good relations with every country, but not at the expense of Persia’s dignity and honour. 5. I cannot help feeling that Persia is pursuing a rash and dangerous policy, both in the sphere of trade and economics. No one can foretell—least of all the Minister of Court himself—whither Persia is being led by her Exchange Control Law her Gold Standard Law, two useless ends of a railway which has already cost her some £4 million sterling, and the prospect of a trade war with her most powerful neighbour and best customer, Soviet Russia.

Copy No. for the Period Tehran Despatch Persian A /fairs. Political. Oawam-us-Saltaneh returned by air from Moscow on the 10th March. Information from a certain source in Moscow regarding the demands made o Persia by Russia was given in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary, ine London Evening News, on what authority it is unknown, stated that the demam &amp; totalled six and comprised :— (i) A treaty of alliance between Persia and the L.S.S.R. (xi) Recognition by the Central Government of the Autonomous Government of Azerbaijan. . (iii) Co-ordination of Persia’s foreign policy with that ot the L.k_.S.±v (iv) An oil concession. „ , j r * (v) The organisation, location and employment of the armed forces ot autonomous Azerbaijan to he under Russian military dnection. (vi) The Persian Government to invite the Russian military forces to remain in Persia pending acceptance of the above. In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Moscow, Qawam- us-Saltaneh referred only to two demands, namely, for an oil concession and recognition of an autonomous Azerbaijan. In reply to the first, Qawam states that he informed the Russians that he had no authority to grant this, a recent law making even the discussion of oil concessions an oflence punishable n impeachment. He was equally powerless to recognise an autonomous Azerbaijan as he had been forbidden to discuss this by the Majlis. When the Russians suggested the election of a Majlis which would repeal the law against discussion of oil concessions, Qawam replied that a law had recently been passed prohibiting the holding of elections for the next Majlis until such time as all foreign troops had left Persia. Qawam also informed His Majesty s Charge d Affanes that he sent a written protest to the Soviet Government on the 4th March when he learnt of their decision to maintain their troops in Persia. In the course ot the conversations the Russians, in addition to advancing the usual reasons for main taining their troops in Persia, such as the danger to the Soviet lmon ansing from Fascist and Imperialist elements so close to its borders, the vulnerability of the Baku oilfields, &amp;c., introduced a novel argument by referring to past history and claiming that Persia’s demands at the Peace Conference of Paris had included Baku. Turkestan [sic] and Armenia. Hakimi had been a member of the Persian delegation. Hakimi had recently been 1 rime Minister. Hakimi had annealed to UNO. Ergo Persia’s claims to Russian territory still stood and PerskPs hostility to the'U.S.S.R. was still in evidence The 1921 treaty was of course, also brought in to the discussions. Qawam said that no agieement had'been reached, even on commercial matters. A communique was published at the conclusion of the visit which stated that the conversations had been carried on in a friendly atmosphere and that, after the new Soviet Ambassador had arrived in Tehran, the two Governments would renew their efforts to place then- relations on a friendlv basis. That the Qawam has come back empty-handed causes no surprise. Mdst people will be relieved if subsequent events confirm that he told the Russians what he avows he told them. The Majlis. 2 In yesterday’s session of the Majlis Deputy Dr. Musaddiq made a long sneeeh in protest against the continued presence of Russian troops on Persian soil after the 2nd March. The main points of his speech were that the presence [75—155]2 % of such troops constituted a direct violation of the Tripartite Pact and that the Prime Minister had gone to Moscow to discuss other problems, not the evacuation of Persia, for which clear provision had been made in the Tripartite Pact. He expressed surprise that no official news had been sent from Moscow by Qawam, even though he had been informed of the Soviet Government’s decision on the 26th February, especially in view of the few remaining days of the life of the present Majlis. A significant point in Musaddiq’s speech was that he said that^* because the Prime Minister’s journey to Moscow had lasted longer than was at first envisaged and because no news had been received from him the Persian nation and people were anxious. Their anxiety was based on the memories they had of the journeys made by the leaders of small nations to the capitals of large and powerful nations during the war which had just ended. He sincerely hoped that such anxiety was groundless. 3. There have been several rowdy demonstrations outside the Majlis and in other parts of the town staged by the Tudeh against any move by the Deputies to prolong the life of the present Majlis beyond the 12th March. The police and gendarmerie, though present at the scene of these demonstrations, took no action to maintain order and several casualties occurred, mostly in the ranks of the anti-Tudeh. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 4. A consular report states that the country round Rezaieh seems to be completely under Kurdish control. The Kurds have formed a Government in which Ghazi Muhammad of Mehabad holds the post of Prime Minister, with Omar Khan Shakkak as Minister for War, Rashid Beg Herki as commander-in chief and Zero Agha as Commandant of Gendarmerie. Kurdish patrols in Rezaieh wear arm-bands inscribed “ Jumhuriet-i-Kurdistan ” (Kurdistan Republic). 5. Conscription for the Azerbaijan People’s Army is arousing bitter discontent in Tabriz. Few of those called up are responding voluntarily and “ Fidais ” (literally “ devotees,” hut here signifying volunteers in the national cause) are arresting young men on the streets. A notice has been published that all those called up who do not report before the 26th February will be tried and punished as deserters. 6. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports that the place of the mounted units which recently left Tabriz for Russia (see paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary) has been taken by mechanised units of at least equal strength. A number of tanks (sheeted) were seen at Tabriz railway station being unloaded from a train which had come from Julfa, and subsequently a column of 40 lorry loads of Russian troops, 20 tanks and 21 armoured cars was seen moving down the road to Zenjan, presumably to reinforce the Democrat troops in action against the Zulfiqari partisans in that area. The Deputy Minister for War in the Azerbaijan National Government is reported as having said that he could not continue to hold Zenjan without further support by the Russians. The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan also alluded in a speech on the 3rd March to the impending arrival of Russian military equipment for the People’s Army. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General reports two other Russian columns as on the move, viz., one on the 3rd March towards Miandoab (rumoured as being bound for Khaneh, on the Iraq frontier) and the other towards Maragheh. A number of Caucasian and Russian officers in civilian clothes are now' believed to be attached to the People’s Army. An American consular source at Tabriz also reports the move of a column towards Khoi, to the west of Lake Urumiyeh. The total Russian evacuations up to date, according to His Majesty’s Acting' Consul-General, are the cavalry unit of 800 men (alluded to above and in paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary) with A.T. guns and A.A. guns and, on the 8th March, a further force of 2,000 Russian cavalry, twelve light field guns and five tractor-drawn heavy guns. There are unconfirmed reports of more arrivals of infantry and tanks by rail from Russia on the 7th March. 7. An unruly mob of Democrats attacked and damaged the P.R.B. premises in Tabriz, where a loud-speaker was installed. The popularity gf British radio programmes and news had long been a cause of anxiety to the Azerbaijan National Government, who would prefer its subjects to listen only to the Moscow brand of truth 8. The Azerbaijan National Government recently announced that part of the Province of Gilan as far as Shiffarud (also spelt Shafarud—about 65 miles south of Astara and 20 miles north-west of Pahlevi) had been amalgamated toAzerbaijan and placed under the governorate of Ardebil (paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary mentioned a move of Democrat forces down this coast from Astara towards Pahlevi). Kurdistan. 9. The Minister for War infoYmed the British Military Attache on the 10th March that, in view of the deterioration in the situation in Kurdistan and of the vulnerable positions of the garrisons of one battalion each at Sardasht and Baneh, he proposed to withdraw these to Saqqiz, which he regarded as a better defensive position. The garrison at Merivan would remain. Khorasan. 10. A reliable report, based on personal reconnaissance by a British consular official, states that the Russian military garrison of 2,500 of all arms evacuated Meshed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th March, moving to Askhabad. Most of the Persian military buildings and barracks have been handed back by the Russians. Very few Russian military personnel were seen in the town. The American Assistant Military Attache, who recently travelled as far as Shahrud and back, saw a cavalry regiment in process of evacuating this place and another on its way from Semnan to Shahrud. While the Tehran-Meshed road from Semnan to Meshed is therefore almost clear of Russian troops by now, the Russians still maintain a small military post of about twenty-five men at Garmsar Railway Junction, which is only 50 miles east of Tehran. About a week ago this post stopped and prevented the further advance towards Semnan of a small force of Persian military composed of two battalions of infantry, a battery of artillery and some tanks. After some days’ delay permission to proceed was given by the Russians, but the General Staff judged it unwise to advance with the Russians in their rear and possible rearguards of evacuating Russian units in front in the neighbourhood of Semnan. Gendarmerie reinforcements for Semnan, Damghan and Shahrud were similarly stopped at Garmsar and their officers disarmed and detained in Russian military custody for twenty-four hours.

[Begins] Azerbaijan Autonomous G-overnment has forbidden public broadcast of news in Tabriz by British Publicity Shop which has been maintained in the main street of that town by Public Relations Bureau of .'Vmbassy Tehran since 1941. The ban does not apply to other loudspeakers maintained in Tabriz by the Soviet authorities which relay news from Moscow and Baku. The British shop which used to broadcast daily B.B.C. news in Persian and Tehran news bulletins has always attracted especial and appreciative crowds of listeners during the four and a half years of its existence. The present ban is the first official move by the self-constituted Azerbaijan authorities to restrict British propaganda in this province, where, during the Allied occupation of Persia it enjoyed the same liberty as, for example, Russian propaganda did in the zone occupied up to March 2nd by the British Army. Soviet forces, it may be recalled, are still in occupation’of Azerbaijan.

Escorted by two Russian soldiers one of whom threatened him with rifle, he was made to drive to guard room at Russian dump nearby where he was kept three quarters of an hour under armed guard. Russian Lieutenant questioned him but as he has no Russian and had no interpreter no explanation was possible. He says that officer s attitude was very hostile and discourteous. His car flies the United States flag and there could be no question that his identity was not known. 2. As indicated in my telegram under reference Russians are extremely sensitive to anything that looks like espionage but this morning the United States Vice-Consul had not attempted to pass down closed road but had merely driven into the railway station square,' to which and to the main road approaching it, general public have free access. 3.

Number of tanks arrived at Mianduab March 12th while he was there. He learned in Mianduab that Russians are constructing new road from there to Shahin Daj forty miles south-east. 2. He believes garrisons of Russian posts at Maragha and Mianduab consist of new troops. He gave lift to two Russian soldiers, one of whom told him in conversation that he and his unit had only just arrived, that he had come from Yugoslavia and that cavalry was being withdrawn from Tabriz and eastern Azerbaijan and being replaced by an armoured divison.r ii i .5.

Column of Russian lorries and anti-aircraft guns observed this morning had apparently entered the town by Julfa road and proceeded trwards Russian barracks. Exact number unknown but probably not less than 50 lorries carrying both troops- and stores and 25 guns. Troops gave the impression of being strangers. 2. Report [grp.undec.] from native drivers employed by the Russians speaks of despatch of number of heavy long-range guns to Maku area. Guns were so heavy that drivers were instructed to by-pass bridges. 3. Report of unknown reliability says that Russian troops arriving at Mianduab are being sent on tp- 3 areas: towards Saqqiz to Shahin Daj and towards Khaneh (Iraqi frontier). 4. I believe Russians are constructing new airfield but do not yet know where. On March 13th 3 fighter aircraft were seen on railway waggons at station. The same afternoon I counted 9 fighters and one transport or bomber on airfield here. This is less than usual number cf fighters.

It is a simple and attractive ocherc* but so far not a single merchant of Tnbriz has come in.

[Begins] tY,t. My telegram No. 65 (not repeated to Foreign Office). During the broadcast of the news from Tehran at 0550 local time tonight when crowd of about 1,000 listeners had assembled outside the Public Relations Bureau shop fifteen armed men belonging to democrat irregular forces (Fidaid (Assistant Secretary of State) Indie) forced their way into the shop and stopped the broadcast. The shopkeeper prevented them damaging the wireless but was himself roughly handled and an attempt was made to stab him. Cash in the shop of about 40 tomans was looted , some books damaged and window completely shattered. 2. From the evidence of my interpreter who was in the street at the time I am sure that attack was made with the connivance of the chief of police who was himself nearby.

The Prime Minister was extremely dissatisfied with his first three talks when the Russians put forward the following three demands- (a) The recognition 'of complete independence of Azerbaijan* (Conversation took place through an interpreter and I doubt whether source distinguished between this and autonomy). (b) Oil concessions for the Soviet Union. (c) The maintenance of Soviet troops in North Persia after March 2nd* He had replied that he was not authorised to negotiate on these heads. 3* The Prime Minister was better pleased with his second /second talk with Stalin ? when the latter had discussed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Persia provided that oil concesions were granted to the Soviet Union- Source * who has been in close touch with the Prime Minister, said however that the Soviet design was to send troops and equipment back under the pretext of guarding the oil concessions^ At all the talks Stalin and Molotov had laid great stress upon the 1921 Treaty, and when the Prime Minister pointed out that all American and British troops would have been withdrawn from Persia by March 2nd, the Russians said that all the same they would still require troops in North Persia for their own safety* 5 ; Source also stated that recently 600 armed men whom he described as Bandits had crossed the Persian- Soviet frontier at Astara and gone co Pahlevi* Among them were some Persian Officers who had mutinied some months ago and who had already been used to prepare the rising at Tabriz* Source had obtained the above information directly from the Persian Prime Minister he added as his personal opinion that the Russians were now thinking of the situation which would arise in a few days when the Persian Parliament would be dissolved and the Shah would constitute the only remaining legal authority 0 They regarded the Shah as pro-British and they/*they were now thinking of displacing him and substituting the present Persian Prime Minister. the latter had admitted to source his knowledge of a movement now being organised for the removal of the Shah and source, who had been favourably disposed towards the Prime Minister on his arrival in Moscow, was now worried about his intentions^ 7e The iiinericn Charg6 d 1 Affairs told me that he had sent a message to the Persian Prime Minister saying that he regretted that he could not call upon him because he is ill in bed. But that the fact that he was not intervening to request information about the detailed course of the negotiations should not be interpreted as showing any lack of interest on the part of the United States of America Government on the contrary, they would be most interested in the result^ This immediately evoked a message from the Persian Prime Minister expressing his satisfaction at this sign of American interest^ The Persian Charge d' Affairs who delivered the message yesterday added that although there had been talks with Stalin and Molotov, the real negotiations had not yet begun,, The American Charg6 d' Affairs action should be treated as confidential as my impression is that he may have been acting without explicit instructions 0 8. I have had the impression that the Soviet Government have hitherto been making much more of their/ 0 ....their Mongolian visitors than of the Persian Delegation.

Ibtihaj Governor of the National Bank. 2. Ibtihaj said advantage would be that the Prime Minister would be received by Stalin whereas this would not be accorded to anyone else. This had been made clear by the Russians, Perhaps the Prime Minister could make a better bargain than anyone else. 3. Ibtihaj however agreed that 1.) if the Prime Minister intended, as he said he did, to refuse concessions on major points viz. Azerbaijan and oil and to keep Persia* s appeal before the Security Council hehe could do that more easily here than in Moscow* where his position if he said no to every proposal would be difficult 2.) his ultimate defence if the Russians were unreasonable was resignation. To resign he must first get away from Moscow and as he would be dependent on Soviet transport and weather that might take a long time. His plan to go to Moscow for a day or two to introduce the Mission and then return might not be feasible 5.) to go to Moscow without having received an assurance that Soviet troops would leave by March 2nd would expose him to blackmail. 4. Ibtihaj telephoned later and said the Prime Minister seemed to realise the risks and to be inclined to postpone his visit until after March 2nd. I fear however that little reliance can be placed on what the Prime Minister says. n e had promised Ibtihaj not to have Sepehr in his Cabinet but seems unlikely to keep his promise.

Seyyid Zia Ed Dins papers and some foreign papers in Tehran try to discredit the National Democratic Movement which they describe as separatist, and they slander the Soviet Union with accusations of interference in Persia’s internal affairs and of intention of incorporating Azerbaijan in U.S.S.R. 2, Article then describes true state of affairs, Azerbaijanians constitute more than one quarter of total population of Persia and played a big part in unification and establishment of Persian State c While maintaining political and economic ties with other parts of country, Azerbaijan was nevertheless sharply distinguished in culture, language and national traditions which have been preserved through centuries, although always ignored by rulers of Persia, KSd. POL 0 EP 1 - 6- FEB194R INDIA OFFICE6.- 5, v -?-946 . As an oppressed nation Azerbaijan took part both in general struggle of Persian people against despotism and in their own struggle for national rights and democratic freedoms. Progressive movement in 1906 to 1911 was born in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijanian democrats played notable part both in this struggle for constitution and in struggle for local self-government. 4, Azerbaijanian national liberation movements were harshly suppressed by rulers of Persia* especially by Reza Shabu Failure to develop industry in Persian Azerbaijan and unbridled licence of local officials brought about ruin of Azerbaijanians.- Lack of most elementary form of health service resulted in child mortality and disease reaching horrifying proportions. Azerbaijanians were not allowed free use of national / language or literature. Official language was Persian. Persian officials practised cruel oppression and used savage police measures to repress any sign of revolt. Central reactionary Government treated Persian Azerbaijan as colony, oppressed and exploited the people. 5. Evidence in Persian press shows that similar policy was continued after abdication of Reza Shah. Reactionary officials oppressed population, and due rations of foodstuffs were at time not sent from Tehran. Repression increased after formation of trade unions and Azerbaijan Democratic party. In October 1945 several hundred members of democratic organiaations were killed and over a thousand imprisoned on false charges.-1946 j 6; Article then recalls on familiar lines General Assembly of Persian Azerbaijan held at Tabriz in November 1945 and formation of Constituent Assembly^ which declared that demands for proclamation of national autonomy by Azerbaijanians in no way threaten integrity of Persian State,' Later a national Majlis was formed which unanimously approved formation of National Government* According to Progressive Democratic Persian papers Majlis'and Government represent most varied sections of population. Some members of Majlis belong to some of best known and wealthiest Persian families, others are men of high academic qualifications and large number are intellectuals. 7. Hakimi Government rejected demands of Azerbaijanians, and under pretext of struggle with Separatist Movement provoked armed clashes in attempt to repress Azerbaijanians by force. Persian military and gendarme garrisons and police in the main were loyal to new Government which took power without bloodshed. Enjoying full confidence of population Government then proceeded to execute its proclaimed programme, which, apart from satisfying purely national demands of people/ provides for maintenance of private ownership in all spheres and for encouragement of individual initiative* Article then gives approvingly details of measures, already reported, taken by Government to develop social and economic life of country*A -4~ [ _ 1946 j 8, Article (TOITG’ln^.S's“ mat all progressive and democratic elements in Persia view events in Persian Azerbaijan sympathetically and mass meetings in Persian cities have demanded recognition of autonomy of Persian Azeroaijan by Persian Government, while democratic organisations such as Union of Fifty two Newspapers, Peoples party and Central Council of Trade Unions, and some deputies have spoken in defence of Azerbaijanians democratic demands for autonomy, Demand however, is still rejected by reactionary section of Majlis and by governing circles who prate of ’’separatism*’ and ’’Russian interference”.

Leader spoke of symptoms of irresponsible endeavour of certain circles to use/- 2 - use first session of General assembly for demonstration against Soviet Union. Is it necessary to add that, if last act of Hakimi government, and those who stand behind it, was evolved as demonstration of this kind, it once more uncovers to the world the irresponsible circles who in Persia carry out anti-Soviet propaganda and are endeavouring to revive times of Reza Shah? 4 0 Soviet press prints brief Tehran Tass message reporting Majlis had favoured nomination of Qawam el Sultan as Prime Minister, and brief London Tass message reporting London wireless to effect that after above pronouncement Qawam el Sultan had stated that he would simultaneously take up question of Persian appeal to Security Council and begin direct negotiations with the Russians as soon as the Shah confirmed his appointment.£F.

One of the heirs, Abdullah has always been difficult and on January 10th he came from Iraq to Khorramshahr and took possession with three or four hundred followers of one of the family palaces.

Following is text of letter addressed to the President of the Security Council by Soviet Delegation dated 24th January and circulated to the Council 25th January. The Delegation of the Soviet Union, acting on behalf of the Soviet G-overnnient, considers it.necessary, in connexion with the appeal of the Persian Delegation addressed to the Security Council to make the following statement: 1. The allegation of the Persian Delegation of interference by the Soviet Union through its officials and through its armed forces in the internal affairs of Persia, is in contradiction with the reality and lacks any foundation.. In this particular case the Persian Delegation repeats the statement made by the Persian Government to the Soviet Government in November 1945. This statement, however, was categorically refuted by the Soviet Embassy in Persia in its note of 26th November, It should be noted also that in its reply of 1st December, 1945, the Persian Government not only failed to disprove the facts referred to in the Soviet note of 26th November, but also expressed, as is stated in the above-mentioned Persian note, 'its satisfaction in connexionI' tL OUTWARD TELEGRAM ' - 2 - with the fact, which was confirmed by the contents of the reply note of the llmhassy, that the interference of the Soviet officials into the internal affairs of Persia in northern regions is not in accordance with the facts'. Moreover, in the same note the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Persia 'expressed its satisfaction at the fact that, as has been pointed out, the Soviet officials fully respect the tripartite agreement and the Declaration of the leaders of the three Great Powers and allied with Persia signed and published in Tehran'. These facts bear witness quite convincingly to the incorrectness and groundlessness of the statement of the Persian Delegation regarding the alleged interference on the part of the Soviet Union in the internal affairs of Persia. 2. Equally in contradiction with reality is the statement of the Persian Delegation concerning the fact that the Persian Government has attempted to initiate negotiations on the above-mentioned question with the Soviet Government which were fruitless. The above-mentioned facts refute this statement of the Bsrsian Delegation because the Persian Government not only attempted to negotiate but actually did negotiate with the Soviet Government on this question, as can be seen from the Persian I note of 1st December, referred to above. 3. The Soviet Delegation considers it necessary to point out that the Persian Government is trying to use the presence of foreign troops in Persia in order to represent this fact as a violation of Persian sovereignity and as a cause of the events which are taking place in Persian Azerbaijan. As a matter of fact, the presence of Soviet troops on the territory of Persia is quite legitimate in so/OUTWARD TELEGRAM ■ so far as such a right was granted to the Soviet Government by the Soviet-Persian treaty of 29th February, 1921, and Soviet-British-Persian Treaty of 1942. The events in Persian Azerbaijan have no connexion with the presence there of Soviet troops, and this is confirmed by indisputable and quite objective factSc These evenxs are of an exclusively Persian and internal nature. As it is known, what is happening in Northern Persia is a demonstration of the aspiration of the population of Northern Persia for national autonomy within the limits of the Persian state, and of the achievement of the wishes of the local population, which is nothing unusual for a democratic country. 4* At the same time the Soviet Delegation cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that propaganda hostile to the Soviet Union is growing stronger in Persia and is far from being discouraged by the Persian Government. This propaganda does not differ in any sense from the Fascist propaganda which was instigated against the Soviet \ Union at the time of Reza Shah, Anti-democratic and pogrom activity on the part of reactionary forces in Persia, hostile to the Soviet Union, which is supported by certain influential Persian groups drawn from the ruling classes and the police authorities, creates for Azerbaijan and for Baku a danger of organised hostile actions, diversions and so forth. Such a situation cannot be tolerated. However, the Soviet Government thinks that such questions * which affect the relations between two neighbouring states - the U.S.3.R. and Persia - can and should be . settled by means of bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Government and the Persian Government, The Soviet Government/•wvy' ■BMP •4 * Os.OUTWARD TELEGRAM Government did not and does not refuse to accept this method of settling such disputes arising between neighbours, 5. In view of these facts, and taking also into consideration that in this particular case the conditions envisaged by Articles 34 and 35 of the Charter of the United Nations Organisation are not present, the Soviet Delegation regards the appeal of the Persian Delegation to the Security Council as lacking grounds and categorically opposes the consideration of the mentioned appeal of the Persian Delegation by the Security Council.OUTWARD TELEGRAM ®)| EXT ^ \ /782 B / [EN CLAIR] v 1946 CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN NO. 87.

Following is summary of letter from the Chief of the Persian Delegation to the President of the Security Council dated 26th January referring to the Soviet Delegation’s letter of 24th January. 1. Continued interference of Soviet military and civil authorities in the internal affairs of Persia can be fully proved. Statement of the facts will be submitted to the Security Council. 2. Soviet Government admitted in their Note of 26th November, 1945, that they had not been willing to allow the passage of Persian reinforcements to suppress the revolt in Azerbaijan. They sought to justify this refusal on excuses which the Persian Delegation regard as quite unjustified. Litvinoff's 1933 definition of an aggressor nation is relevant to Persian case. The refusal of the Soviet Government to allow the passage of Persian security forces to go through part of Persian territory is a breach of the tripartite treaty of 1942 and of the Declaration of Tehran. 3. The British and United States.Governments made representationsOUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - representations to the Soviet Government on the above point. 4. The Persian Note of 1st December is misquoted or mistranslated in the Soviet Delegation’s letter. This Note did not acknowledge that no Russian interference took place but expressed the hope that interference would cease. 5. Persian Delegation repeats that the attempts of the Persian Government to negotiate with Soviet Government were unsuccessful. Persian Notes asked that free passage be granted to Persian forces. This request was never granted. In mid December, 1945, Prime Minister offered to go to Moscow to discuss these matters, but the offer was ignored. 6. i\lthough Persian Government in their letter to the Security Council has not raised the question of the with drawal of Soviet forces the Delegation points out that the 1942 treaty provides that foreign troops may remain six months after the war, not that they must. The treaty of 1921 to which Soviet Delegation refers is not relevant. No hostile third parties exist in Persia and the Persian Government can deal effectively with any situation if allowed by the Soviet authorities to move their forces. The treaty of alliance of 1942 provides for the withdrawal of Soviet troops without any reference being possible to the treaty of 1921. The Persian Government repeats their request that their troops and officials should be given free passage. 7. There is no propaganda hostile to the Soviet Union in Persia. In spite of violent Moscow press and radio propaganda against the Persian Government there have been no similar polemics in the Persian press. Soviet authorities in Persia describe opposition to Soviet interference as anti-Soviet activity. 8. Conditions envisaged in Charter exist and the Security Council should investigate this dispute between the Persian and Soviet Governments.FILE COPY OUTWARD TELEGRAM SECRET^ &amp; ^ With the ComD^rnenia of the SeiK'Qtn.uv of State .

Hearing of Persian question was resumed in the Security Council on 30th January and continued for over four hours. Persian Delegate spoke first and refuted Soviet claim that there had been direct negotiations which had produced a satisfactory settlement. He went on to say that the Persian Government was prepared to undertake direct negotiations if the Security Council so recommended and on the conditions that the Security Council took the negotiations under its aegis and that the progress and results of the negotiations were reported to the Council. In no circumstances could he agreo to the matter being taken out of the hands of the Security Council. 3. The Soviet Delegate made a long speech filled with further sophistical interpretations of past history. He stated that the denial of entry to the Persian Government’s rein- forcements was inspired by the belief of the Soviet High Command that the Persian Government had already sufficient PeCd. PGL cipl 1 forces 6- FEB194B INDIA OFFICEOUTWARD TELEGRAM 2. ^ forces in the area to keep order. The Soviet Government had not agreed to the Persian Ministers going to Moscow last December because, he alleged, it had been decided at the Conference not to discuss the Persian question. Mr. Vyshinsky said that the Persian delegation had nov/ fully met the Soviet Government's views by agreeing to direct negotiations. However, the Soviet Government could in no circumstances accept the condition that the Security Council should supervise the negotiations as distinct from being kept informed. This was unacceptable as contrary to the dignity of the Soviet Government, the United Nations and the Security Council itself. 4-. .After the Persian Delegate had been granted permission to correct certain mis-statements of Mr, Vyshinsky* the- President threw the question open for discussion and proposals by other Delegations, and I made a statement. Pull text of this will be telegraphed to—morrow, but following were main points. 5. The dispute had arisen out of•the execution of the Tripartite Treaty of 1942, particularly Article 4. I could not reconcile with the stipulations of the Treaty Mr. Vyshinsky s remark that it was for the Soviet Government to decide the sizes of Persia's security forces in North-West Persia. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government this was a matter only for Persian Government. All the Allies should be grateiul to Persia lor help she gave in the war. This imposed firm obligation on the Allies to preserve the” integrity of Persia and hand it back intact with all our forces ^one. The Persian Government had asked for observance of the Treaty and for the right of Persian Forces to keep order. I asked the SovietOUTWARD TELEGRAM 9 3 0 Soviet Delegate in the friendliest fashion if he denied that right. In similar circumstances His Taiesty's Government would not regard it as an affront to their dignity if the Security Council wanted to enquire into the situation. His Majesty’s Government v/anted a peaceful settlement, hut they detected in this dispute the tactics of a war of nerves which came very close to falling within Hr. Litvinov's definition of aggression. As a party to the 1942 Treaty, His l&amp;jesty's Government were entitled to ask that the matter should he left before the Security Council, who should hold the balance in the negotiations. I concluded by expressing sincere hope that there was no disagreement that the integrity of Persia must be maintained, foreign troops removed by the Treaty date, and Persia left to work out her own problems in her own way. 6. The Un ited States Delegate did not touch on the merits of the dispute, but expressed satisfaction that the parties were willing to negotiate. He insisted that the Security Council could not divest itself of responsibility in any matter brought before it. The Council should approve bilateral negotiations, but insist on being kept informed until a mutually satisfactory solution based on the principles of justice had been reached. 7. The Chinese and Trench Delegates also avoided the merits of the dispute, and suggested procedures for settlement by bilateral negotiations, which were conciliatory to the Soviet point of view. 8. The Polish Delegate thought the dispute was an inevitable heritage of the war, called for mutual trust and deprecated the intervention of any third party.OUTWARD TELEGRAM 4. 9. The Netherlands Delegate saw no need for periodic progress reports to the Security Council and proposed a draft resolution, calling on the two parties to negotiate directly and to inform the Council of the results so that the matter could be taken off the Council's agenda; this procedure however should not prejudice the Council's right to take the question up pending receipt of information from the parties if it considered this necessary. 10. The Australian Delegate said his country wanted full discussion of all complaints. He thought the Council's proceedings in the Persian case marked important progress. He insisted on the council being kept informed of negotiations as well as settlement, but somewhat illo- gica 11 y proceeded to second the Netherlands draft resolution, 11. A long discussion ensued on the terms of the draft resolution, I said I could accept the Netherlands draft, subject to provision that negotiations should resume at once and that Council should retain the right to enquire progress of negotiations at any time. Without this addition the Netherlands formula would give the impression that the Council had washed its hands of the matter. The United States Representative supported me and insisted that it be understood that dispute should remain on Council's permanent agenda. I confirmed that this was my intention, Polish Representative suggested that it was unnecessary to specify the Council's right of intervention which already existed under the Charter. Soviet representative stated emphatically that if dispute were kept on agenda it could only be with a view to a recommendation under Article 37 (2) of the Charter. Soviet-Persian situation however/ presented no (repeat no) threat to the peace and suggestion to the contrary was only an instance of suspicious tendenciesOUTWARD TELEGRAM 5. tendencies which had in the past impaired harmonious co~ operation of the United Nations. 12. I replied that there was no question of expressing distrust of either party to the dispute hut only of fulfilling our obligations under the Charter. As I saw it, the Council was bound to complete the discharge of its responsibilities under Article 56. I asked Soviet Representative whether, if passage relating to the question’s remaining on the agenda were deleted from the draft, he would agree that the Council could still resume discussion of the matter if progress of negotiations were not satisfactory. Soviet Representative said that in the unlikely event of negotiations not succeeding owing to intervention of 'hot-headed persons' or otherwise, he would answer 'Yes, in accordance with the Charter'. 13. Draft resolution amended in accordance with my proposals (text in my immediately following telegram) was then adopted unanimously by the Council, following a state ment by the United States Representative that he accepted it on the understanding that the Perso-Soviet question remained a matter of concern to the Council until a settlement had been reached in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the Charter.

D. 10.25 p.m. January 31st, 1946, Repeated to Washington No. 1066 (IMMEDIATE) Security Council], Following is text of my first speech in Security Council on 30th January: Mr. President, this dispute between these two Governments has arisen in pursuance of the carrying out of a treaty to which the United Kingdom Government is a party, as well as the two Governments concerned; and the essential paragraph in that treaty is article 4, and I propose to read it: 'The Allied Powers may maintain in Iranian territory land, sea and air forces in such numbers as they consider necessary. The location of such forces shall be decided in agreement with the Iranian Government so long as tne strategic situation allows# All questions concerning the relations between the forces of the Allied Powers and the Iranian authorities shall be settled, so far as possible, in co operation with the Iranian authorities in such a way as to safeguard the security of the said forces. It is understood that the presence of these forces on Iranian territory does not constitute a military occupation and will disturb as little as possible the administration and the security forces of Iran, the economic life of the country, the normal movements of the population and the application of regulations' INDIA OFFICE |OUTWARD TELEGRAM 2 . In that paragraph, the High Contracting parties undertake z-v to leave the sovereignty, the administration, the movement of security forces, the police, and everything, to the sole judgement of the Iranian Government. I was a little perturbed when I heard Mr. Vyshinsky say that it was the Soviet Government that decided that the number of police and soldiers in Azerbaijan was sufficient to keep order, because under this treaty the sole judge of that, in «ur view, as a party to the treaty, was the Iranian Government, and no-one else. The treaty also said that we would withdraw our forces six months after the end of hostilities which is March 2nd. No other treaty, no other Powers, nothing else, ✓ was taken into account in arriving at this treaty. In fact, I ought to say, speaking for my Government, that we felt a sense of gratitude, at very dire moments when the war was at its worst, that the Iranian Government placed their territory, their citizens and their communications at the disposal of the Allies, and our feeling is very strongly that if v/e entered a territory for the purpose of conducting the war against Germany and later against Japan, we have even a greater duty than the treaty lays down - and it is to make sure not only that we preserve the integrity of the country that placed its territory at our disposal, but that we hand it back intact, with our forces gone and without interference with its sovereignty. Therefore, the question arises, has the sovereignty of the Iranian Government been infringed? This is where the evidence is a little conflicting.
