M AJOR MORTON, the British Engineer India Office, . , -r, October 30,1905; deputed to investigate M. van Roggen s scheme September 26, of irrigation, pronounced a wholesale condemna- 190(5. tion of it in his Report, and set about preparing a feasible project for the utilization of the river for the irrigation of a considerable area. The Government of India subsequently India Offioe, # ^ • September ^6^ expressed their conviction that any Concession 1906&gt; granted bv the Persian Government for carrying out this scheme should, if possible, he obtained for British enterprise, and expressed at the same time their willingness to make a loan to the Persian Government for this object. His Majesty’s Government were, however, of To Rdia Office, opinion that, in the position in which the Anglo- Russian negotiations regarding Persia then stood, it would be impracticable to make any advance to the Persian Government otherwise than in agreement with that of Russia. The Netherlands Government still remained Mr. Grant Duff, __ . i i No* 22Qj anxious to push M. van Hoggcn s scheme, and September 8,1906. their Minister at Tehran twice approached His Sir C. Spring-Rice, Majesty’s Legation with inquiries as to the views Tele ’ hic? of His Majesty’s Government on the subject. October 18,1906. On the second of these occasions his Excellency was informed that this question should be addressed to His Majesty’s Government through the Netherlands Minister in London, and Sir C. Smdno*-Rice was instructed ta inform the Persian To Sir C. Spring- Government that His Majesty s Government r p e i e g ra phic, expected to be consulted before any definite step October 19,1906. was taken in the direction of granting a Conces sion in connection with this project. In November the Moin-et-Tujjar, who holds a To Sir C. Spring- # . I* .1 TT XvlC0 9 No* 32 Oy Concession for the navigation of tne upper Telegraphic, Karun, informed Sir C. Spring-Rice, on behalf November 3,1907. of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whose Agent at Tehran he is, that the Sheikh was opposed to . any foreign Concession or foreign financial aid, but was anxious to form a purely Persian Com pany and engage a foreign expert as adviser. The Moin stated that the Arabs would never allow foreign interference with their land, and that the Persian Government were aware of this. Oq the 21st December the Netherlands ^ Minister in London called at the Foreign Office December 21, and made a statement to Sir E. Barrington on 19 &lt;&gt; 6 . the subject.His Excellency stated that the Russian Government had intimated that they had no objection to the execution of M. van Roggen’s scheme, provided that the Company to which it was intrusted was a Hutch and not a British To Sir H.

Spring-Rice, No. 36, Telegraphic; No. 37, one, as, in view of the negotiations in progress between England and Russia for an under standing with regard to Persia, it was undesirable that either country should appear to have a special interest in the project. Baron Gericke pointed out that the condition made by the Russian Government Avould not prevent the employment of British capital in the enterprise. On the 9th January Sir E. Grey informed the Minister that, in view of the unsettled political situation in Persia, His Majesty’s Government could not entertain any question relating to a foreign Concession in that country for the moment. The Hutch Minister again raised the question in February, and warned Sir E. Grey that, unless the Concession were secured by the Hutch, it would fall to the Hresdner Bank. He said that the Assembly would not object, and asked His Majesty’s Government to remain neutral. A reply was returned similar to that given on the 9th January. A report of the conversation having been telegraphed to Tehran, Sir C. Spring-Rice re ported that there was reason to fear German February^, 1907. ac tion- He and the Hutch Minister thought that the best means of preventing it would be to form an international Syndicate, and suggested that he should inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government would have no objection to the formation of such a group. To India Office, The India Office were consulted, and concurred February 26,1907. {.j ie adoption of a neutral attitude and in the proposed instructions to Sir C. Spring-Rice to act as suggested hy him, which w'ere accordingly sent. The latter shortly afterwards reported that he was assured by the agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah that the Sheikh would undertake the works himself, and would not admit foreign intervention beyond advice. The view taken by the India Office was that the Sheikh’s position and opinion could not be ignored; that a suggestion to this effect should be made to the Persian Government, who should be informed that if a Concession were eventuallv Sir C. Spring-Rice, No. 46, Telegraphic, March 7, 1907. India Office, March 16, 1907.granted to an international Syndicate, IIis Majesty’s Government would wish, to be in formed of the details of the scheme; and that, if it proved satisfactory, and no valid objection were raised by the Sheikh, they would adopt an attitude of neutrality. Sir C. Spring-Rice was instructed to ascertain whether the Sheikh had put forward any demand for a Concession, and, it so, to make a communi cation to the Persian Government in the sense suggested by the India Office. He replied that the Sheikh had made no definite proposal, but that he did not intend to ask for foreign capital. In view of the latter statement, it was held that the Sheikh’s scheme was doomed to failure. Subsequently Sir C. Spring-Rice reported that he proposed to remain neutral, and to keep the Sheikh informed as to the course of events. The Sheikh explained to Major Cox that he would prefer things to remain as they were, except for such irrigation as could be effected on the river banks by means of machine pumps, with wffiich he was experimenting; but that, if a large scheme were inevitable, he wished to manage it himself under our guidance and with our co-operation. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh, a large proprietor near Ahwaz, expressed the opinion that the present population w r as not large enough to cultivate the existing area of arable land, and that it would be impossible to find sufficient hands to cultivate the new r land reclaimed. This view r was fully confirmed by His Majesty s Consul at Mohammerah, who also thought that the introduction of cultivators from outside might be resented by the Arabs. Sir C. Spring-Rice considered that, in view 7 of the attitude of the National Assembly and the determined opposition of the Sheikh of Moham merah, an early development of the Dutch scheme seemed improbable, and stated that he had explained to the Dutch Minister that it could not hope to succeed without the active assistance of the Sheikh. It appears that Herr Gutmann, when at Tehran in connection with the establishment of a German bank, was approached by the Dutch Minister on the subject, but replied that his bank could not consider so extensive a scheme.

To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, September 4, 1907. The German Minister informed Sir C. Spring- Rice that, although no German project had been formed, he had instructed a member of the German Legation to make a full report on the subject, as it was his duty to put his Government in possession of full information as to the commercial possibilities of South-West Persia. Sir C. Spring-Rice thought that the question was, or would shortly be, under consideration at the Dresdner Bank, but that, in the present financial position of Germany, so large and doubtful an enterprise could hardly be taken in hand seriously. In the course of a conversation with Mr. Mallet, Mr. Lynch stated that be had been approached by M. van Roggen, who was anxious to obtain British capital, and would himself withdraw when the Company was floated. Mr. Lynch asked whether His Majesty’s Government would support him. Mr. Mallet replied that M. van Roggen was not a British Company, but a Dutchman; that our policy was to remain neutral, but that if a British Company came armed to us with a Concession, he could not say what our attitude wmuld be. He added that it seemed unlikely that M. van Roggen would get a Concession. A. letter was received shortly afterwards from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, expressing the hope that His Majesty’s Government w r ould not acquiesce in any scheme which did not safeguard beyond all doubt, and at all seasons of the year, a supply of water fully adequate to the navigation of the Korun River. After consultation with the India Offlce. the Company were informed that their observations would receive due consideration. Attack on His Majesty's Consulate in Seistan. Mr. Grant Duff, Nos. 81 and 82, Telegraphic, March 23, 1906. On the 28th March, 1906, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran reported that serious disturbances had broken out at Nasratabad in consequence of certain measures which had been taken for the suppression of the plague in Seistan, and that, at his request, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had instructed the Governor- General of Khorassan and the local authorities to [1044] * Cafford the necessary protection to His Majesty’s Consulate. In the course of these disturbances the dis- Mr. Grant Duff, pensary attached to His Majesty’s Consulate was A p r jj 25 , 1906. wrecked, and the Consul, the doctor, and two native employes were pelted with clods of earth by the rioters. After the disorders had subsided the situation in the province remained threatening, and Mr. Grant Duff was instructed to impress on the To Mr. Grant Persian Government that they would be held Telegraphic, responsible for it, and to press for their imme- A P ril 7 &gt; 1906 - diate permission for the extension of the telegraph line to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, which had already been the subject of urgent representations, and which was shown by these occurrences to be more than See Confidential Paper, p. ever necessary. It was, however, thought better not to present any demand for the punishment of the rioters or any claim for compensation for the outrage which had been committed until all danger of further disturbance was at an end. Mr. Grant Duff was subsequently instructed to To Mr. Grant urge on the Persian Government the adoption of Telegraphic,* the necessary pimitive measures, and to point out April 19, 1906 that if they failed to carry them out they would afford proof of their inability adequately to protect His Majesty’s Consulate, and would com pel His Majesty’s Government to take steps accordingly. Mr. Grant Duff addressed a series of notes on this subject to the Persian Government, who, in their replies, deprecated the immediate punish ment of the ringleaders in the disorders in view of the disturbed condition of Seistan and the sad situation of its population, and affirmed that all necessary measures for the restoration and main tenance of order had been taken. They refused at the same time to grant the extension of the telegraph line demanded. On the 5th May Mr. Grant Duff reported that there were no signs of any steps being taken to arrest the ringleaders, but in the middle of the same month the Momtahen-es-Sultaneh, a special official, left Tehran for Nasratabad with instruc tions to deal with the case, and His Majesty’s Government considered that it would be advisable to await his arrival and that of further reinforce ments to the troops in Seistan, since an attempt on the part of the Persian Government previous to this might lead to further disturbances which they might not be able to suppress, and the Mr. Grant Duff, No. 124, April 26, 1907.

It was not till August that the Momtahen-es- Sultaneh verbally agreed with His Majesty’s Consul to recommend to the Persian Govern ment the following steps in satisfaction for the outrage :— 1. An apology to be offered by the Deputy Governor, the Mustaufi, and the ringleaders in the riots. 2. Four of the principal agitators to be deported from Seistan. 3. 100Z. to be paid in compensation for the damage done to the dispensary. 4. A free grant of land of 10,000 zars to be made for the extension of the British Consular hospital at Nasratabad. On the 18th August the Persian Government were officially informed that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept these proposals. After a long delay the Persian Government replied expressing willingness to accede to the demands, but professing inability to expel the ringleaders, and raising objections to the grant of land for the dispensary, on the ground that such a step would give rise to similar pretensions on the part of other Powers. They offered, how ever, to sell the necessary land to His Majesty’s Consulate. His Majesty’s Government, after consideration, decided to abandon the two demands (2 and 4) which were obnoxious to the Persian Govern ment on condition that the remaining two (1 and 3 ) were immediately complied with, and that the land required was sold to His Majesty’s Consulate at a nominal price. Sir C. Spring-Rice was accordingly instructed to communicate this decision to the Persian Government, who subsequently settled the matter on these lines. Seistan Water Award. In reply to the note addressed to them by His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at Tehran on the 2nd December, 1905, the Persian Government stated, in a very involved and obscure note, on the. -i. v^-%- - ffPt 8 22nd February, 1906, their objections to Colonel Mr- Grant Duff, Mt Mahon’s Award, which appeared to be as Telegraphic, „ ,. March 3,1906. follows :— 1. The Goldsmid Award has not been followed, Ditto, No. 89, . -i M&amp;rcu 29, 190v)« but only the interpretation placed upon it by the Foreign Office. The right of opening up old canals and digging new ones is denied to the Persians and allowed to the Afghans, since the canals lie in Afghan territory. A large tract of land in Persia will thus be left uncultivated. 2 . The share of water given to the Persians is less than half as much as they require for the irrigation of their land, which is double that of the Afghans, so that they ought to have two- thirds of the water instead of one-third. o. As the area of cultivation in Afghan territory will be increased, Persian peasants will emigrate thither. 4. The restriction applied to Persia alone regarding the alienation of water to a third partv should be extended to Afghanistan also, and such a restriction is not mentioned at all in the Goldsmid Award. 5. If the new Award had followed the old one it would have been unnecessary to appoint a permanent irrigation officer. The Persian Government were informed on the 8 th March that if they really desired to maintain their refusal to accept the Award they should submit a reasoned appeal in due form for the decision of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in accordance with the Agreement of November 1902. On the 7th April the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Grant Duff that the Persian Government had only made the Agree ment in question on condition that the Award of the Commission or the decision of the Secretary of State was in Agreement with the Goldsmid Award. The objections of the Persian Government to his Award having meanwhile been submitted to Colonel McMahon, the latter furnished an exhaustive Memorandum explaining the principles on which his Award had been based. He held that the only objection that really merited con sideration was the absence of any provision for the future irrigation of the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract, the Award only providing for the irrigation Mr. Grant Duff, No. 102, Telegraphic, April 13, 1906.

To Mr. Grant Duff, No. 38, Telegraphic, March 3, 1906. of the present inhabited portion of Persian Seistan. The point had already been considered by the Government of India and decided before the Award was given, their-decision being based on the argument that the Goldsmid Award refers only to existing cultivation, and that the present Award should be similarly restricted. He regretted this decision, considering that the Award should contain provision for future con tingencies. He did not advise any alteration of the Award, but suggested either ( 1 ) that it might be intimated to the Persian and Afghan Governments that the irrigation of the Persian Pamrod-Hauzdar tract was a question which could not be dealt with in the present arbitration and remained therefore a matter for future settlement, or ( 2 ) that the Secretary of State might add a corollary to the Award to the effect that, should the irrigation of that tract become possible through mutual understanding between the Persian and Afghan Governments, the future consideration of the grant to Persia of a further share of the Helmund for the purpose, amounting to one-sixth of its water, would not be debarred by anything in the Award—the whole Persian share of the river not to exceed one-half. It was decided that as the question was not pressing it would be best for Sir C. Spring-Rice to discuss it with Colonel McMahon, who was in London, and that it should not be raised until the former reached Tehran. Sir C. Spring-Rice has, however, so far not thought it politic to mention the subject to the Persian Government. Attack on Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer in Luristan. In January 1906 Mr. Grant Duff reported the refusal of the Persian Government to pay compensation for this outrage, on the ground that the responsibility for the attack on these officers rested with themselves, in view of the fact that, previous to their departure, they had been warned by the local authorities of the insecurity of the roads and the disturbed state of the tribes. His Majesty’s Government, in March, informed the Persian Government that, in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the measures taken to [1044] D10 punish tho culprits, they were unable to modify their demands, and urged them to take advantage of the season to chastise the Lurs. In reply, the Persian Government denied that Mr. Grant Duff, *■ % iii . No. 75 , the measures which they had taken were m- March 26, 1906. efficient ; repeated the arguments which they had previously advanced ; and again refused the compensation demanded. In forwarding the correspondence on this subject, Mr. Grant Duff stated that he had little reason to hope that any further representations would be successful. In June 1907 a telegram was sent to His To Sir C. Spring- , i Rice, Imo. 72, Majesty’s Minister, inquiring whether there was Telegraphic, any prospect of recovering the sum claimed J une 11 * :l907 * (2,000/.). He replied that the Persian Govern- sir C. Spring-Rice, ment had no money; that they maintained that Telegraphic, due warning was given as to the risk run; and June 12, 1907. that the recent rebellion in Luristan proved the impossibility of guaranteeing the safety of travellers. In view of this telegram, the India Office were To India Office, consulted as to the desirability of recovering the amount out of the Jask royalty. They strongly objected to this course, and India Office^ referred to a statement made by them in 1906 Jul ^ 1 0 ’ that the claim was not a strong one. The recent correspondence was communicated To Treasury, • p i i i * .4-1 July l%)\)§• to the Treasury, who were informed that m the circumstances it was not proposed to take any further action in the matter. The Treasury having acquiesced, the India Treasury^^ Office were informed of the decision to let the T o India Office, matter drop. August 6, 1907 Meshed—Seistan and Tehran-Meshed Telegraph Line. Proposed Exchange of British and Russian Control. During the negotiations which took place in Sir 0. Spring-Rice, 1902 between the Russian and Persian Govern- p^pj^ber 6,1906. monts on the subject of a loan, one of the condi tions proposed by the former was the construe tion of a Russian telegraph line from Meshed along the Afghan frontier to Seistan; but M. Witte subsequently modified this by agreeing that the line should be constructed and worked by the Persian Government out of the proceeds11 Mr. Grant Duff, No. 33, Telegraphic, January 31, 1906.

A. verbal promise was at the sama time given by the Shah that the services of Russian signallers should be used on the line, and that its Seistan end should not be connected with the Central Persian or Indian telegraphic system. The Persian Government at first allowed the employment of these signallers, but afterwards insisted on their recall. In May 1905 the Russian Government renewed their pressure on this subject, and the Shah, then about to leave for Europe, consented to the temporary re-em ployment of the signallers pending a discussion of the question with the Emperor of Russia. By June of that year the working and control of the line were already in the hands of the Russians, and fifteen Russian engineers and telegraphists were serving on it. In January 1906 His Majesty’s Charg 6 d’Affaires at Tehran was informed by the Persian Grand Vizier that negotiations for the withdrawal of these officials were in progress, but, neverthe less, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reported in June that they had moved the battery of the line and the end of the wire at that place into the Russian office, so that they could, at will, cut off both the British and Persian offices, and monopolize the line. On the 19th July Mr. Grant Duff reported that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him confidentially that the new Russian Minister w'as pressing the Persian Government very hard formally to surrender the control of the line to the Russians, and on the 29th August Mr. Grant Duff informed His Majesty’s Govern ment that he had been warned that this cession was about to take place. The next day the Grand Vizier admitted to Mr. Grant Duff that orders had been given for the transfer of the instruments at Meshed to the Russian office. These orders had been given by the Shah, in compliance with a written demand from the Russian Minister, but no further concessions would be made. Nevertheless, early in September His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan reported that there also the Russians were arranging for a separate room in the telegraph office to which instruments would shortly be moved, and through which the line could be led. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!! was instructed to point out to12 the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that, if the news of the transfer of the line to Russian control were confirmed, it would constitute an important modification of the status quo in Versia, which His Majesty’s Government had been so cireful to maintain. His Excellency was to add that if the Russian Government had really authorized this step, His Majesty’s Government would have to consider what counter-concession they might be compelled to demand. Before Sir A. Nicolson had time to carry out Sir A. Nicolson, these instructions, M. Isvolsky spoke to him Telegraphic, spontaneously on the subject, stating that he had ^ )t ®“h er 8 ; only just heard of the matter from the Russian September 8,1906. Ambassador in London, and had learnt, on inquiry at his Ministry, that M. Hartwig had made, on his own initiative, some arrangement with the Persian authorities respecting “ an interchange of telegraphic apparatus,” which, as it was only a minor technical question, had not been submitted to his Excellency. Sir A. Tsicolson then stated to his Excellency the case as it had been reported to His Majesty’s Govern ment. M. Isvolsky replied that he had never heard of any such project, and that he would never authorize any disturbance ot the status quo. He promised to investigate the matter. On the 11 th September M. Isvolsky read to Sir A. Nicolsm a Memorandum prepared in his Department on the subject, stating that all that had taken place was the connection of the wire with the Russian instruments in order to insure rapidity and correctness in the transmission of messages. Sir A. Nicolson replied that this was not all Sir A. Nicolson, 217 that had been done, and once more explained the Telegraphic, situation in the light of the information in the 115 possession of His Majesty’s Government, and September n, asked that matters might be restored to the 1906 ' position they had occupied in June. * M. Isvolsky expressed himself as puzzled, and promised to study the question further. The next day Sir A. Nicolson sent to Sir A. Nicolson, M. Isvolsky a Memorandum showing what had taken place, and on the 19th September the ^230,^ latter handed to him a reply traversing most of September 19; the statements in the first Memorandum and 19 , justifying the action of the Russians. 1906. Sir A. Nicolson then informed him that he was prepared to propose a compromise in the shape of an exchange of the cession to Russia ofTo Sir A. Nicolson, No. 274, Telegraphic, September 7, 1906.

His Excellency had been authorized to make this proposal earlier in September, hut had suggested that it would he better to defer doing so, a suggestion which was approved by His Majesty’s Government. M. Isvolsky promised to study this proposal. His Majesty’s Government were determined to make the satisfactory settlement of this question a condition of co-operation with the Russian Government in the proposed joint advance to X ersia, but M. Isvolsky was most um ' illing to treat the matter in this way, fearing that the exchange of the two lines would cause excitement in I’ersia, attract the curiosity of third paities, and prematurely disclose the aims of the discussion in progress, and thus jeopardize the success of the whole negotiation between the two Powers. He therefore desired to treat the question, along with other telegraph questions, as part of the General Agreement which it was hoped to conclude, and keep it apart from that of the advance. His Majesty’s Government, however, adhered to their view, which M. Isvolsky again combated, at the same time begging for more time to study the question. Sir A. Nicolson, No. 264, Telegraphic, October 10; No. 686, October 10, 1906. To 8ir A. Nicolson, No. 487, October 31, 1906. At length, on the 10 th October, he addressed to Sir A. Isicolson a further Memorandum, repeating the arguments used before against an immediate exchange of lines, and suggesting, as a compromise, the addition of a special wire to the Meshed-Seistan line, to be worked with English instruments, and of a similar wire on the Tehran- Meshed line, to be worked with Russian instru ments. The Memorandum maintained the con tention that the recent proceedings on the former line did not constitute a disturbance ol the status quo. His Majesty’s Government, after mature con sideration, found themselves unable to accept the proposed compromise. They considered that the proceedings of the Russians with respect to the Meshed-Seistan line had had the effect of transferring the line from Persian into Russian hands, which constituted a radical modification of the status quo at a moment when negotiations [1041] Ebetween England and Russia were in progress at St. Petersburgh, which was inconsistent with the proposal for the recognition by Russia of a line from Biriand to Bunder Abbas, to the east of Sir a. Nicolson, which British influence was to be paramount. Telegraphic, His Majesty’s Government accordingly proposed November 3,1906. a reversion to the status quo, or, failing this, an exchange of lines as previously suggested. After some delay the Russian Government, Sir A. Nicolscm, ^ . No. 303 while still maintaining that no violation of the Telegraphic, stains quo had taken place, proposed the following ^’ v ^ 2 ber 30; compromise :— November 30, r ’ 1906. 1 . The addition of a second wire to the Meshed- Seiscan line, to be worked with English instru ments. 2. The addition of a similar wire to the Meshed— Tehran line, to be worked with Russian instru ments. 3. The continuance on Russian and English instruments as at present of the existing wires on both lines. 4 . The gradual substitution by Russia on the Meshed-Seistan line of stronger cypress poles, capable of bearing two wires for those at present in use. 5 . The recall of the Russian inspectors on the Meshed-Seistan line and the appointment instead of Persian gholams, to be paid by Russia. 6 . Abstention on the part of Russia from placing any obstacles in the way of the construc tion by England between Nasratabad and Koh-i- Malik Siah. After consultation with the India Office, To s^r A. Nicolson, Sir A. Nicolson was instructed to propose to Telegraphic, to the Persian Government that, to avoid the February 8,1907. expense of placing additional wires on the lines, combined offices should be established at all stations where British and Russian signallers w ere employed or separate offices belonging to each Power with a commutator accessible to each, and that the signallers of each Power should have for certain fixed hours in each day uninterrupted possession of the offices and lines. Nothing more was heard of this proposal, ^^ lcolson ’ and the original idea of an exchange of the February 20,1907. Meshed-Seistan and Tehran-Meshed lines was reverted to. The Russian Government were in favour of arranging the matter separately from the Anglo-After an exchange of views between the two Sir Governments, identic instructions were sent to October 2, 1907. the British and Eussian Representatives at To Sir C.

Spring-Rice recommended that Ap.il 17, 1907. the Department should renew their Concessions which also expired in 1925 tor a similar period. The India Office approved the proposal but sug- India Office^ gested the advisability of informing the Russian N IJ Government of any action taken in the matter. The necessary instructions were accordingly To Sir 0. Spring- sent to Tehran and St. Petersburgh. May 15,1907. The Russian Government pointed out in reply To Sir A. Nicolson. that two of the lines would pass through M °' y 15 ’ 1907&gt; ])ro vinces included in the proposed Russian sir A.

Spring-Bice had tele graphed that in view of the Russian reply he proposed to suspend action in the matter though he did not anticipate much difficulty in getting the extension. In July a suggestion was made by the India Office that, as an inducement to the Persian Government to renew the Concessions, they might he informed that we did not in future intend to put forward claims for damage to the line, as had been the practice hitherto, and Sir C. Spring- Bice was authorized to make a communication in this sense when the time came to discuss the question of the renewal. It was suggested by Sir C. Spring-Bice that, in order to prevent an arrangement between Russia and Germany, if our rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line were surrendered to Russia, a provision should be made that they should not be transferred to third parties without our consent. The India Office were in favour of this pro posal, hut it was not considered advisable to introduce at that moment a further condition into the negotiations. On the 24th August the Russian Government replied to the proposal which Sir A. Nicolson had been instructed on the 21st June to make to them. They accepted in principle the cession to Russia of our rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line, and stated that they had no objection to the renewal for twenty years of the Tehran-Bushire, Jask-Gwadur, and Kashan-Rohat Concessions. Sir C. Spring-Rice was therefore instructed to approach the Persian Government in the matter when he considered the moment opportune. He replied that he thought the moment inopportune in view of the recent publica tion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement and the unsettled political situation. Proposed extension of Telegraph Line from Seistan to Indian Frontier. Duplication of Wire from Tehran to Shahrvd. Sir C. Spring-Rice, At the end of April 1907 Sir C. Spring-Rice Telegraphic, reported that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs April 29,1907. had applied privately to the Indo-European [1044] F,Telegraph Department for assistance in pro viding material for the construction of this extension which the Persian Government pro posed to carry out themselves. As the Government of India had in store at India Office, Robat all the material required, it was considered Tq Sir ’ c Spriflg . that an attempt should he made to induce the Rice, No. 57, Persian Government to intrust the construction i^ a y^ i 9 q 7 ’ and control of the line to the Government of India, and instructions in this sense were sent to Tehran. Sir C. Spring-Rice replied that it would be Sir C. Spring-Rice, difficult to obtain this, in view of the existing Telegraphic, feeling against foreign Concessions, and suggested Ma y 9 &gt; 1907 - that the Telegraph Department might offer to give the iron posts stored at Robat for the price which w r ooden posts would cost, and to lend experts to assist in the construction, and that when con structed, the line might be maintained by the Department. After consultation with the India Office Sir C. India Office, Spring-Rice was instructed to inform the Persian To gir c gpring . Government that ibe Government of India were Rice, No. so, prepared to sell the material at Robat at the rate j u jy r g ioo?'. list value exclusive of cost of transport and to assist in the construction on the same terms as in the case of the Henjam-Bunder Abbas line, viz., the line to be constructed by the Indo- European Telegraph Department at a price pre viously estimated and to be handed over to the Persian Telegraph Administration on its comple tion and on the repayment of its cost, that the condition attached to this proposal was that the Persian Government should undertake that the control of the line should never be made over to any foreign Government or Company, and that none but Persian and British employes should be employed on it. The advantage to His Majesty’s Government of this proposal was held to be that the Persian Government are not likely to be able to repay the cost for a long time, and that until they do so the line would be controlled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Sir C. Spring-Rice replied that the Persian Sir C, Spring- ^ # nice No 170 Telegraph Department had not renewed their Telegraphic, request, and that if he raised the question 7,1907 officially it would be opposed by the Russian Minister. Il was decided not to take any steps towards obtaining the withdrawal of Russian opposition19 To Sir C. Spring- Rice, No. 82, Telegraphic, July 13, 1907. Sir (J.

Spring-Rice was in structed to suspend action for the present. On the 15th July Sir C. Spring-Rice tele graphed that he had secret information that t he Minister of Telegraphs was receiving a loan from the Russian hank for the purpose of con structing the Seistan-Robat line, and a second wire from Tehran to Shahrud for the use of the Russian Legation. He thought this loan had as a condition that the Robat line should he under Russian control. To Count Renckendorff, July 24, 1907. the information as to the Seistan extension did not appear sufficiently well founded, but a Memorandum was addressed to the Russian Ambassador with regard to the reported loan and second line to Shahrud, pointing out that such action would be a disturbance of the status To Mr. O’Beirne No. 116, July 26, 1907.

Spring- Rice, No. 210, Telegraphic, August 9,1907. quo which it had been agreed to maintain pending the conclusion of the Agreement. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at St. Peters- burgh was instructed to mention to the Russian Government the report as to the Seistan exten sion, and also to explain that the Persian Government had in April asked us to help them in constructing the line, but that, in view of the understanding as to the status quo, we did not propose at present to consent, though we assumed the Russian Government would raise no objection to our doing so eventually, having already admitted the principle (see clause 6 of Russian proposal on p. 14). The Russian Minister for Poreign Affairs informed him, in reply, that the report as to the loan for the purpose of the extension was unfounded, and that, though it should not be done pending the conclusion of the Agreement, the Russian Government had no objection to its eventual construction with British funds. In the meantime, the Russian Minister had informed Sir C. Spring-Rice that he had taken no steps whatever in the matter of the Seistan extension. The latter accordingly informed the Grand Vizier that if any steps were taken for its construction without our knowledge and con sent he would hold the Persian Government responsible. On the 9th August Sir C. Spring-Rice reported that the Persian Government had given an assurance that they would not allow the line, if constructed, to fall into the hands of theRussians, and that the Russian Minister had naked for the construction of a second wire to Sh&amp;brud on the well-founded ground of delay in transmission of messages. The Russian Ambassador also denied that the ^. en - Russian Legation had attempted to obtain a randura second wire to Shahrud 11 for their special use, August 20 ,1907 - 1 iwwi mnflft for this purpose or for the construction of the Seistan extension. It was consequently concluded that the second Mmute to n ia wire to Shahrud was merely a supplementary August 15, 1907. wire, which would be under the same control as the original one. The incident was therefore deprived of any importance* Proposed Appointment of French Financial Adviser to Persian Government. In August 1907 a request was made by the Persian Government to the French Minister for the appointment of a French financier to report and advise on the financial situation. 'The Russian Government Minister saw no objection, especially as in case of a refusal, the Persian Government might appoint a Swiss who would be under German influence, but thought the appointment should be subject to th«' follow!nsr conditions : Sir C. Spring-Rice, No. 232, Telegraphic, August 26, 1907. Sir A. Nicolson, No. 442, August 30, 1907. 1. That he should engage not to interfere in political matters; 2. That he should not assist in organizing the National Bank; and 3. That he should not treat in regard to a foreign loan without informing the British and Russian Representatives. The view taken by llis Majesty’s Government was that they would prefer a French Adviser to one of any other nationality. On the 23rd September Sir C. Spring-Rice telegraphed that the French Government had not yet appointed an expert and that the delaj was unfortunate. Sir h\ Bertie was thereupon instructed to speak to the French Minister lor Foreign Affairs on the subject suggesting the desirability of losing no time in coming to an agreement tih to the appointment with Great Hritain ami Russia, To Sir A.

Mr. Lister was informed by the French Government that M. Bizot, an Inspector of Finance, had been selected. The French Minister at Tehran thought it would not he possible to mention in the contract the conditions desired by the Russian Govern ment, but suggested that they might be secured by furnishing M. Bizot with a letter of general instructions stating that he must on all matters consult the Russian and British Legations and that he was under the general instructions of the French Legation. His Majesty’s Government were satisfied with this suggestion, but the Russian Government wanted more details as to the proposed instruc tions to M. Bizot before deciding. The Assembly, however, proved suspicious of the omission from the proposed contract of all reference to the National Bank. The Russian Minister was therefore prepared to allow the National Bank to be mentioned in it, and to rely solely on M. Bizot’s general instructions to insure that it should not be established. This procedure did not meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government as it did not seem straightforward or fair to press the Persian Government for the conclusion of the contract unless the establishment of the National Bank under proper conditions were contemplated. It was, however, pointed out to the Russian Government that it was of the greatest importance to conclude the contract without delay in order to prevent the serious danger of Persia having recourse to Germany, and that even if the National Bank w r ere founded it would be less harmful under French than other auspices. They were therefore urged to agree to its conclu sion without further delay even if mention had to be made of the establishment of the National Bank. The Russian Government agreed and the French Government promised to hasten conside ration of the contract which had been accepted by the Assembly as soon as they should receive it. Mr. Marling on the 22nd December reported that the German Charge d’Affaires was intriguing to secure the appointment of M. Priem, one of the Belgian Customs’ employes who had been [1044] G adismissed by the Assembly, that the Ireneh Government were making difficulties as to •M. Bizot’s contract, and that a fresh draft was being sent to Tehran by post. He pointed out the danger of this delay. Sir F. Bertie was thereupon instructed to To Sir F. Bertie, represent to the French Government the import- Telegraphic, ance of accepting the contract without further December24,1907. delay. The French Government replied that they were sir F. Bertie, quite alive to the necessity for getting the matter Telegraphic, settled but that there were several points which December25,1907, they considered unsatisfactory. For instance, it was not stipulated what his exact title should be —that of Financial Adviser not being mentioned. As this did not appear very satisfactory Sir A. NmoJson, Nicolson was instructed to consult the Russian Telegraphic, Government as to what further action would be ^® mber ao ’ advisable. Concession for German Bank. In August 1906 permission was given by the Mr. Grant Duff, 3 i ± o r\ No. 236, Grand Vizier for the establishment ol a German September 13, Bank in Tehran. 1 )6 ' The German Chargd d’Affaires informed Sir To Sir F. Lascelles, C. Hardinge of the fact, but stated that it September 25, indicated no change in German policy as regards 1906 . Persia, where Germany had no political interests, and only wished to develop her trade. A few days later he informed Sir C. Hardinge To Sir F. Lascelles, ^ , i • 271, that, owing to the lack of interest shown m October 2,1906. the proposal by German financiers, it was not unlikely that the project would never be realized, but that in any case it would be a purely private bank, and in no sense a State Bank, and that the German Government would refrain from entering into any question of a loan to Persia. Nothing more was heard of the matter until April 1907, when Herr Gutmann, of the Hresdner Sir C. Spring-Rice, l ^ q ^ ^ Bank, and recently Director of the Orient Bank Telegraphic, at Cairo, proceeded to Tehran with the object of February 2,1907. giving effect to the project. He informed Sir C. Spring-Rice that he Sir C. Spring-Rice, . ‘ , , No. 103, intended to begin operations on a • modest May 10&lt; 19 o 7 . scale by advancing money on bills of lading in connection with the trade between Persia and Constantinople. He further proposed to look about him for profitable enterprises, and hoped to find such, especially in connection with mining and irrigation.23 Sir C. Spring-Rice, No. 115, May 24; No. 158, July 16; No. 175, August 12,1907. t Sir C. Spring-Rice, No. 175, August 12, 1907. The original permission to establish the bank appears to have been given on the understanding that the bank would make a loan to the Persian Government, and it is believed that the first draft submitted by Herr Gutmann contained a clause binding the bank to advance 1 , 000,000 tomans. This clause was rescinded by the German Minister on the ground that “ it would embarrass the Persian Government.” The real reason was possibly the pledge given by Germany to England and Russia that there would be no question of a German loan to Persia. It may, however, have been that Herr Gutmann realized the impossibility of obtaining proper security for a loan. His demands included the right to lend money on mortgage; to import 100 , 000 /. worth of silver for coinage free of import duty ; the preferential treatment of debts due to the German Bank which were to be collected by the Persian authorities; mining and irrigation coq- cessions ; and the grant of free sites at Tehran, Tabreez, and Bushire. Sir C. Spring-Bice informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs of his objection to any grant of a concession on the shore of the Gulf, and to any preferential treatment of debts due to the German Bank, but he distinctly stated that he could have no objection to the establishment ot a commercial banking-house which the Germans by Treaty had a perfect right to demand. He, however, insisted that as the affairs of British and Russian enterprises had been submitted to the Assembly, full publicity should be given to the German Concession, and that the Assembly’s consent should be publicly asked for. It is therefore clear that Herr Gutmann’s accu sation that Sir C. Spring-Rice opposed the scheme at every step is quite untrue. The latter con fined his action to seeing that existing British interests were not injured. The German Minister adopted a somewhat per emptory tone with the Persian Government, threatening them with the Emperors displeasure if his proposals were not accepted. The Concession was subjected to a prolonged discussion in the Assembly, and was eventually passed, but in a much modified form. It contained no mention of mining and irrigation rights The claim respecting free import of silver, the right to lend money on mortgage, and preferential treatment in the collection of debts were elimi-24 ated, and the bank books were to &gt;e open &lt; be inspection of the Persian authorities. The Concession binds the Deutsc it I ' ien tank to open a branch in Persia within three oars with a capital of 200.000/. It holds good or forty-five years, and will thus continue til Uree years after the expiration ot that of Imperial Bank, giving the Germans t e^oppor- sunity of acquiring the right to issue bank-notes- Ihe bank agrees to undertake all financia commercial operations on its own account and on account of others.

Herr Gutmann was .deeply disappointed. He informed Sir C Spring- Rice that he had been grossly deceived y Persians, and that his experience of their metho s of business led him .. pl~ 1 * 1 . “ , 1 „ ,«.«» ol a'? ehtmpmm » “ country were reduced to the status of Bgjpt lC rease of Consular Escort at Ispahan, Shiraz, and Ahwaz. On the 5th September, 1907, Sir C. Spring- ice telegraphed that, owing to the menacing ititude of the populace, His Majesty s ousu - eneral at Ispahan asked that his guard might e increased to twenty men. The India Office were requested to give the ecessary instructions to the Government o ndia, which they did on the understanding that he cost would be equally divided between the British and Indian Governments. The Govern- nent of India proposed to send up two ve ex ra men, nominally for the relief of the existing escort of eight, whose relief was then due, but that the escort should not actually ie icie\e until the spring.

The tribesmen were rapidly getting beyond control, and the work might have to be abandoned. His Majesty’s Consul recommended an increase of his escort for their protection. The Government of India, after consulting His Majesty’s Hesident at Bushire, stated their readiness to send ten men, with one officer, for the protection of each of the two principal camps. Both the proposals were submitted to the Treasury for their sanction. They replied that they were prepared to sanc tion the increase at Ispahan if it was required solely for the protection of the Consulate and Consular staff, but that they could not do so in the case of Ahwaz, where the increase seemed to be mainly required for the protection of the employes of the Oil Syndicate. Further representations having been made to them as to the disastrous effect on British prestige which the abandonment of the Oil Syndicate’s enterprise would involve, they eventually recon sidered this decision, on the understanding that the increase should only be maintained for six months, and the Government of India were requested to make the necessary arrangements for the immediate dispatch of twenty men and two officers. Mr. Marling, however, considered twenty men an altogether insufficient increase for Ahwaz, and seemed to contemplate the dispatch of a force of 100 men. He was informed in reply that the force he recommended would he too small to he justifiable on military grounds, although it would be large enough to be misinterpreted by the Persian Assembly and Russian Government. The dis patch of twenty men was a different matter; they were intended as a substantial addition to Captain Lorimer’s escort of twelve men, which he appeared to contemplate using at Batwand and other places. It must be left to his dis cretion when and in what numbers to employ them. If they proved insufficient for the pro tection of all the camps, the employes must be concentrated where they could be protected, and if a serious attack was anticipated, the officer in charge should avoid a conflict and retire to the river with the British employes. [1044] H*26 Similar arrangements as in the case of Ispahan were made for the retention of the actual guard at Shiraz after the arrival of the expected reliefs until the situation should improve.

On the 1st December, 1905, the Persian Grand (Confidential 1 izier applied to His Majesty’s Government, p^io?./ 6 ^* through His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, for a further loan of 800,000/., offering as security the Caspian fisheries, post and telegraph revenues and customs of Pars (all of which had already been pledged for the two previous advances), and stating that if he failed to do this, he would be forced to accept an offer made by Russia of a third loan of 1,500,000/. on certain political conditions which he declared himself unable to reveal. This request was referred to the Government of India for their views, and they, Government of on the 9th January, 1906, stated the conditions Mr'Morley which, in their opinion, should be insisted on in Telegraphic, return for such a loan, if it were decided to grant Ja,mary 9 ’ 1906 * it. These conditions were as follows :— 1 . A concession for a road from Bunder Abbas by way of Regan to Bam, together with the exclusive right of running motors or other mechanically propelled vehicles thereon. 2 . An undertaking from the Persian Govern ment that any roads, railways, telegraphs, or cai.als in Southern Persia (t.e., south of a line from Khanikan to Birjand) should be constructed under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government so far as foreign assistance might be required for the purpose. 3. The right to carry out the Karun irrigation scheme on the lines already indicated by the Government of India. 1 . The right to connect Robat with Nasratabad by telegraph. After considering, however, the arguments in Mr. Morley to favour of granting the loan, His Majesty’s ^ f °^™“ eDt Government decided to refuse it, on the grounds Telegraphic, January 24,1906.27 Sir C.

They realized, of course, that the' Persian Government would, in consequence of their refusal, jwobably apply to Russia, but they had good reason to believe that this application would be refused, in view of Count Lamsdorff’s expression to Sir C. Hardinge on the 5th January, 1906, of his strong objection to making any further loan to Persia. Trustworthy information did, in fact, soon afterwards reach His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran that the Persian Government had already approached the Russian Legation on the subject, though they were endeavouring at the same time to induce His Majesty’s Government to reconsider their refusal. His Majesty’s Government felt unable to do this, and so informed the Persian Government, at the same time telling the Russian Government, confidentially, what had occurred, and adding that, if a similar application were made at St. Petersburg!!, England would expect reciprocity on the part of Russia. They intimated, how ever, that should the Russian Government consider it for any reason desirable to assist Persia financially, they would be quite ready, if consulted, to discuss the matter in a friendly spirit. This communication was well received by the Russian Government, the Emperor personally expressing his satisfaction ; but, nevertheless, the Persian Government once more endeavoured to induce His Majesty’s Government to grant a loan by asserting that, if the request was refused, Russia was ready to do so, though on onerous conditions. At the same time they tried the same tactics to persuade Russia to lend, but their efforts proved unsuccessful in both cases. The Persian Government next attempted to obtain money by intimating, on the 18th February, 1906, to Mr. Grant Huff that theywere ready to accept the 150,000/* which His Majesty's Government had expressed their AviJlingness to advance in July 1905, but His Majesty’s Government declined to renew the offer, on the ground that it had since been set aside by proposals of a totally different character. No further development of this question took place till May, when a rumour reached His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran that a loan of 25,000,000 marks was about to he made to the Persian Government by Germany, under cover of Belgian financiers, on the following conditions 1 a coaling station on the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. A concession for a road from Kermanshah to Khanikin. 3 . A hospital and college at Tehran under German management. The necessary Agreement was said to have been negotiated by M. Nans during a visit to Constantinople. Sir E. Grey mentioned this report to Coun Benckendorff in conversation on the 11th May, and suggested that a joint loan to Persia by Great Britain and Russia might he worth considering as a temporary expedient to aid m the preservation of the status quo and prevent the interference of third persons until a final arrangement of the Persian question between the two Powers had been concluded. The Persian Grand Vizier, on his part, denied to Mr. Grant Duff that any negotiations were m progress for a loan from Germany, though he stated that, as financial assistance was denied both by England and Eussia, Persia would he obliged to apply for money elsewhere. Whether the rumour was founded on fact it is not possible to determine, but it was in any case sufficiently persistent and explicit to cause con siderable anxiety to the Russian Government. Early in July a fresh report became current at Tehran to the effect that the Persian Government were about to obtain a loan from Belgian financiers. This rumour was denied by M. Nans, but Sir A. Hardinge was, nevertheless, able to report some days later from Brussels that a proposal had been received there from that To Mr. Grant Duff, No. 33, Telegraphic, February 20,1906.

Late in August the Persian Government again pressed the Russian Minister at Tehran to obtain for them an immediate advance of 3,000,000 tomans, and also a loan of 20,000,000 tomans, stating that their hnancial condition was such that they would subscribe to any conditions which might be demanded of them. 'they pretended that His Majesty’s Government had been offering them a loan in return for political concessions, and intimated that if neither England nor Russia would help them, they w r ould be obliged to apply to Germany. In these circumstances the Russian Government expressed the desire to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the best means of assisting the Persian Government, whose financial condition was doubtless almost desperate. His Majesty’s Government expressed their willingness to discuss the question of making a joint advance, and for this purpose to instruct Mr. Grant Huff to ascertain, in conjunction with M. Hartwig. how much was required and how its application to objects of real necessity could be secured. * His Majesty’s Government were of opinion, however, in view of the uncertainty of the Shah’s health and the consequent instability of the present Government in Persia, that it would be more useful to defer the loan, which might enable a better start to be made with a new Government; any immediate loan shou Id be sufficient only for the bare necessities of a short period. His Majesty’s Government added that thev assumed that the Russian Government agreed with them in supporting the candidature of the Valiahd as the successor of the Shah. The Russian Government agreed to send similar instructions to M. Hartwig, and the two Representatives, after consultation, agreed to make the following recommendations to their Governments:— 1 . No large sum to be lent. 2. A combined advance to be made, of [1044] Iwhich the probable amount would he about 400,000/. 3. Half the advance to be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia and half to the Russian Bank. 4. Both Legations to be notified when the Persian Government desired to draw. 5. Strict accounts to be rendered to both Legations at stated intervals. 6. No part of the advance to be applied to paying oif the sums due to the two banks from the Persian Government. 7. Measures to be taken to insure the applica tion of the money to real necessities. Just at this time the Russian Government Sir A. Nicolsou, -N o* 21 »3 V erv informed His Majesty’s Government that they Confidential had learnt that negotiations were proceeding ™inters; between the Persian Government and a German No. 600, Very hank (as M. Isvolski supposed, the Deutsche septembS, 1906 . Bank) for an immediate advance, without any guarantees, of 5,000,000 tomans and a subsequent loan of 15,000,000 tomans, to be secured on some guarantees and concessions, among the latter of which would figure the establishment of a German bank in Persia. This revival, in a very circumstantial form, of the report of a contemplated German loan perturbed the Russian Government considerably, and they expressed anxiety to block the scheme by arranging for an immediate joint advance by England and Russia. His Majesty’s Government accordingly pro- To S^rA. Nicolson, posed to them the adoption of the conditions Telegraphic, proposed by the two Representatives at Tehran, ^P^ mber 12, and suggested that, as security for the British half of the advance, they should take a lien, additional to that which they already held, upon the customs of the Southern and Gulf ports, and that they should receive an undertaking from the Persian Government not to grant to other Powers concessions for railways, roads or telegraphs in the district east of a line drawn from Birjand to Bunder Abbas. This would leave Russia free to take security or make her own terms west of that line. After considering the proposals of His Sir A.^Nicolson, Majesty’s Government the Russian Minister for Telegraphic, Foreign Affairs informed Sir A. Nicholson that he ^G ember 17, thought it more prudent not to connect with so pir A Ni co lson, comparatively trifling a matter as the proposed No. 628, advance demands of so far-reaching a character No 636) September 20, 1906.winch were practically to be equivalent to the division of Persia into spheres of influence, and which might alarm the Persian Government and drive them to apply to others who would relieve their immediate necessities on less burdensome conditions. He suggested, therefore, that the repayment to the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Bussia Bank of the advances made by them to the Persian Government, which w r ould shortly fall due, should he postponed, that llis Majesty’s Government should content themselves with a lien on the customs of the ports of Southern Persia, and should furnish their moiety of the advance at once, the Russian Government supplying theirs in five or six months, as it was inconvenient to them, for various reasons, to To Sir A. Nicolson, No. 324, Telegraphic, September 19, 1906. Sir A.

To Sir A. Nicolson, No. 369, Telegraphic, September 27, 1906. provide it immediately. His Majesty’s Government had no objection to the first two of these conditions, but considered that each Government should share in the first moiety of the advance, and desired to obtain from the Russian Government the recognition of the Birjand—Bunder Abbas line as a starting point of common action. The Russian Government expressed their willingness to meet the views of His Majesty s Government on the first point, but M. Isvolski still demurred, for the reasons which he had already given, to the recognition in connection with the joint advance, of the Bunder Abbas line, though both he and the Minister of linance were personally in favour of admitting it and of finding Russia’s sphere of interest in Northern Persia. His Majesty’s Government remained of opinion that their acceptance of M. Isvolski’s view, that it was inadvisable to exact conditions from Persia in return for the advance, did not pre clude the recognition by the Russian Govern ment of the Birjand-Bunder Abbas line as delimiting the sphere of British influence in Eastern Persia, and the immediate settlement of the telegraph difficulty in Seistan. They preferred that these conditions should be accepted by Russia at once as the starting point of common action, but were nevertheless willing to pay their first contribution of 100,000/. if the exigencies of the situation in Persia should befound to demand the immediate payment of the first moiety of the advance before it was possible to come to an arrangement with Russia to the above effect. They informed the Russian Government, however, that they would be unable to contribute to the second moiety of the advance unless the Birjand-Bunder Abbas line were recognized and the telegraph difficulty in Seistan settled accordingly. M. Isvolski stated that if His Majesty’s Sir A^Nicolson, Government insisted on their point of view, Telegraphic, Russia would have to find the money foi the gg 2 . second moiety of the advance without the September 29, assistance of England, as she could not recognize the Birjand-Bunder Abbas line without previous consultation with his colleagues, from some of whom he expected opposition. He renewed his appeal in favour of keeping all such questions for discussion in connection with a general Anglo-Russian Agreement, for which he adduced several fresh reasons. In deference to M. Isvolski’s objections, His Majesty’s Government decided no longer to insist on the recognition of the Birjand—Bunder Abbas line as a condition of joining in the second moiety of the joint advance, but they instructed Sir A. Nicolson to reiterate the demand for the settlement of the telegraph question in Seistan, which, they contended, constituted, as it stood, a disturbance of the status quo to the disadvantage of England, and was consequently incompatible with a fair start for common action on the part of the two Governments. The question of whether the mode of payment, control of expenditure, &amp;c., of the proposed advance should l)e discussed and settled at St. Petersburgh or at Tehran was the occasion of a temporary divergence of views between the two Governments, but the Russian Government, who were at first in favour of the formei couise, yielded to the opinion of His Majesty’s Govern ment, who advocated the latter, and the Repre sentatives of the two Powers at lehran were accordingly furnished with the necessary instruc tions on the subject.

The advance was to be made through the Imperial Bank of Persia, to whom drafts for 50,000/. were to be forwarded by the Treasury and the India Office respectively, and who were requested to place the whole sum of 100,000/ without delay to the order of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. With regard to the rate of interest and date of repayment of the advance, His Majesty’s Government were in favour of fixing the rate at 5 per cent., of which (in the case of the British moiety) 1 per cent, should accrue to the Imperial Bank of Persia as commission. The Kussian Government, on the other hand, wdshed the rate to be 9 per cent., the normal rate in Persia being 12 per cent., as a low rate would prejudice that on the loan which might hereafter be concluded. They were also in favour of fixing an early date of repayment, in order to prevent Persia Irorn unduly protracting the negotiation of a settle ment, should one. be necessary. They suggested for this purpose the 22nd March, 1907. His Majesty’s Government thought these terms too severe, and were opposed to specifying any date of repayment, and after some negotiation the To Sir A. Nicolson, Russian Government agreed to accept 7 per cent. No ' 406 ’ as the rate of interest, and proposed that the two Governments should notify to the Persian Government that, without fixing at once the date of repayment, they reserved to themselves the right of giving the Persian Government three or four months’ notice of the date when the advance should be refunded. His Majesty s Government accepted this proposal as satis factory, and Sir C. Spring-Rice was authorized to make the advance as soon as his Russian Sir C. Spring-Rice, colleague should receive similar instructions. No. 291, D Telegraphic, October 18, 1906. Sir A.

Spring-Rice telegraphed to His Majesty’s Government the text of the Loan Convention proposed by the Russian Government between the Persian Government and the banks ; it was as follows :— “ I ti view of the understanding between the Russian and British Governments, in virtue of which it has been decided that an advance of 10 , 000,000 fr. shall be made to the Persian Government, of which 5.000,000 fr. shall be paid at once, the two Governments each paying a half, and the five latter millions in the same way, according to an agreement to be made later, the following is agreed upon :— “ Article I. “ The [ ] Government puts at the disposal of the Persian Government a sum of 2,500,000 fr., which shall be paid by the [ ] Minister each time that the latter shall receive an application from the ersian Treasury, which shall furnish at the same time the justification for the employment of the sums. “ Article II. “ The sums above mentioned shall not be affected to paying the arrears due to the [ ] Bank. “ Article III. “ The Russian advance is guaranteed by the revenues of the Customs already affected to the guarantee of the two loans concluded in 1900 and 1902 between the Persian Government and the Russian Bank; the English by the revenues of the Administrations of Posts and Telegraphs and, in case of insufficiency, the revenues of the Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf. “Article IV. “ 'I'lie rate of interest is fixed at 7 per cent. “Article V. “ The Russian and British Governments reserve to themselves the right to give the Persian Government four months’ notice of the date on which the Persian Government will be called on to repay to the Russian Bank and the Imperial Bank of Persia the sums advanced, together with interest.” His Majesty’s Government accepted this text, which was then submitted to the Persian Government. They also agreed to it, but asked that in Article V the words “ after a delay of one year ” might be inserted after the word “ right,” by which at least a year’s grace would he assured to them.

His Majesty’s Government expressed their willingness to agree to this addition if the Russian Government also accepted it, but the latter, in the instructions which thev sent to their Minister at Tehran on the subject, autho rized him to fix one year as the date of repay ment, and to amend Article V in the sense that the two Governments should have the right to demand repayment one year after the signature of the contract, on giving three months’ notice. His Majesty’s Government accepted this arrange ment, though it was not in strict accordance with the desires of the Persian Government. About this time signs of dissatisfaction at the project of an advance began to manifest them selves among the Persian people. Prominent Mollahs demanded its submission to the Assembly, while members of that body itself expressed the strong repugnance which it felt, to pledging national revenues for foreign loans, and papers protesting against the advance as a betrayal of Persian interests, and denouncing the Grand Vizier as a traitor, were circulated in Tehran. The Assembly demanded a week to consider whether it would accept the advance t and summoned the Minister of Finance to explain the financial situation. In these circumstances the Grand Vizier expressed his willingness to sign the contract without the consent of the Assembly, but although there was no legal objection to that course, His Majesty’s Government considered it more prudent to take no immediate action, but to wait till the Persian Government and the Assembly had come to an agreement. The Russian Government were so informed. The latter meanwhile were able to collect money for the payment of the troops, as well as some 60,000/. for a new National Bank. The Russian Government concurred in the view of His Majesty’s Government that the advance should be made publicly, that the responsibility for it should lie with the PersianGovernment, and that it would be preferab e to take no action till an agreement had been reached between that Government and the Assembly; but they saw no objection to furnishing the money on a formal demand from the Persian Prime Minister, even without the consent of the Assembly. They were also m favour of informing the Valiahd of the situation with regard to the loan, through the British and Kussian Ministers at Tehran. They stated tha they had instructed M. Hartwig in this sense, and* requested that similar instructions might he sent to Sir C. Spring-Bice. After considering the matter in consultation with Sir C. Spring-Bice, His Majesty’s Govern ment informed the Bussian Government that, in their opinion, it would be better, when the Persian Prime Minister made a formal deman , to consider the question of compliance on its merits, and that it would be inopportune to inform the Valiahd at once, as His Imperia Highness had publicly expressed his respect for the Assembly, and such a communication migh have the appearance of pressing an unpopu. ai loan on his acceptance. The Russian Government accordingly in- structed M. Hartwig not to mention the loan to the Valiahd, and to continue to act in harmony with Sir C. Spring-Rice. Shortly afterwards, as the result of a conversa- tion with M. Hartwig, Sir C. Spring-B.ce suggested the advisability of informing the Persian Government officially that the two Governments withdrew their offer of an advance. He pointed out that the popular opposition to this measure was still strong, and that it was possible that, in view of this, the Valiahd an Grand Vizier, induced by severe financial pressure to apply for the advance, might throa the odium of the transaction on the two Powers, by asserting that they had acceded under pressure He added that the impression already existed that Great Britain and Bussia were trying to force the advance on the Persian Government against the will of the people. He subsequently, however, added that it was desirable to consider carefully the time and manner of making the proposed announcement, and to leave the door open for negotiation, lest the Persian Government should have an excuse for annlving for money elsewhere.

Treasury, August 26, 1907, On the 1st January, 1907,|M. Isvolski informed Sir A. Nicolson that the Russian Government agreed with the conclusion of the two Ministers at Tehran in favour of the withdrawal of the offer, but as Sir C. Spring-Rice now reported that the Valiahd had accepted the clause of the Constitution relative to the principle of financial control by the Assembly, and that, therefore, it seemed to him unlikely that the Persian Govern ment would ask for the advance without popular sanction, there was, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, no longer any motive for such a step. The Russian Government, having received a similar report from M. Hartwig, also changed their view, and it was accordingly agreed between the two Governments that the offer should be left as it was. A further reason for doing so was the fear that the withdrawal of the offer might cause Persia to turn for financial assistance to Germany. In July the India Office asked that the amount might be retransferred to them from the bank as there seemed no immediate likelihood of the advance being required though they added that there would be no difficulty should the occasion arise, in providing at a very few days’ notice any sum which might be required for a joint Anglo-Russian loan. The Treasury were thereupon asked whether they wished a similar course to be followed with regard to their share of the advance. It was at the same time explained to them that in suggest ing this Sir E. Grey was not abandoning the principle of the loan which was still held at the disposal of the Persian Government. The Treasury having accepted the suggestion the sums were repaid by the Imperial Bank to the Treasury and India Office. Note on the Interpretation of the term “Ports of the Persian Gulf.” Six 0. Spring-Rice, The Persian Government demurred to this No. 279, ^ expression being used to describe the guaiantee O^tober P l2,1906. of the British moiety of the joint advance, and desired the substitution for it of a statement that the security was the same as that of previous To Sir 0. Spring- Rice, No. 181 ; October 13, 1906. loans. His Majesty’s Government saw no objection to the proposed statement, but Sir C. Spring-Rice [1044] Lwas instructed, in agreeing thereto, to make it clear to the Persian Government that Great Britain adhered to the interpretation of the term “ ports of the Persian Gulf,” laid down in Foreign Office despatch No. 121, of the 8th August, 1904, and that the Persian Government must make arrangements accordingly. Proposed Anglo-Russian Advance to Shah on his Accession to the Throne. With a view to secure the peaceful accession of the Valiahd to the throne, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested the advisability of placing at the disposal of the British and Russian Legations a sum of money for the payment of the troops in case of need, and so securing their loyalty. The idea having met with approval, it was suggested to the India Office that, in order to avoid the delays and difficulties which would occur if the money were to be provided partly from British funds, the Government of India might be asked to provide 50,000/. as the British share of the loan. The India Office consented on condition that the Imperial Government agreed to make good half of any loss which might be incurred. As the death of the Shah appeared imminent, Mr. Grant Duff was informed that if on his accession the new Shah required assistance beyond what the Imperial Bank could give, he should concert with his Russian colleague with a view to a joint advance, and that we were pre pared to lend up to 50,000/. on the same terms and security as our previous loans. 'Treasury sanction to the condition made by the India Office was given on the 6th November, whereupon the India Office were informed that a request for the payment of 50,000/. to the Imperial Bank would be made to them on the death of the Shah. On the occurrence of the latter event the India office stated that they had paid this sum to the Bank. The Valiahd, on leaving Tabreez for the capital, had been supplied by the Russian Bank with about 33,000/., and it was suspected tha he may have received more on his arrival at Tehran. Sir C.

Naus had applied for 30,000/. to pay the troops, and that he proposed to authorize the Imperial Bank to advance this sum, half of which was to he repaid by the Russian Bank. The Russian Government, to whom the matter was referred, agreed. Meanwhile, however, Sir C. Spring-Rice reported that he had ascertained that the Cossack Brigade had already been paid, that he thought M. Naus, whose position was weak, wanted the money for his own purposes. He was accordingly instructed to use his dis cretion, and shortly afterwards reported that the country was quiet, and that he and the Russian Minister agreed that the moment was not favourable for making the advance. Circumstances necessitating the advance net having arisen, the sum of 50,000/. was in Sep tember retransferred by the Imperial Bank to the India Office. Grant of Six Months’ Delay in Payment of Interest on British Loans and Suspension of Sinking Fund Payments for Three Years. A request was received from the Persian Government for a delay of six months in the payment of the interest on the British loans of 1903-4, due on the 5th April. After consultation with the India Office Sir C. Spring-Rice was instructed to agree on condition of the elimination from the Charter of the National Bank of the clause granting priority in the importation of silver. On the 24th June, Sir C. Spring-Rice tele graphed that the Ministers had been requested by the Assembly to obtain the assent of the British and Russian Governments to the sus pension for three years of the sinking fund payments. It was suggested to the India Office that should such a request be received from the Persian Government, it should be acceded to on the con dition that they agreed not to contract any loanAvitli a foreign bank or Government without the option first being given to hiiigland and Russia. The India Office concurred in the proposal. In^Office^ On the 24th July, Sir C. Spring-Rice reported Sir C. Spring-Rice, that he had received a formal request from the Telegraphic, Persian Government for the suspension of the July 24, 1907. sinking fund. After further correspondence with the India Jo IndiaJJffioe, Office it was decided to make our consent August 20,1907. dependent upon the following condition in RdiaJ^ffice,^^ addition to that already mentioned, viz., that the M Persian Government renew their engagement not to grant to the Russian Bank or any other parties the monopoly of coining silver in the State mint, and to inform them that we reserved our rioht to demand the payment of the arrears of the sinking fund at any time unless in the meantime some serious effort were made to put the finances of the country in order. Instructions in this sense were sent to Sir C. 102 ,^ Spring-Rice, and the Treasury were informed, as Telegraphic, also of the six months’ delay already granted in the payment of interest. July 31, 1907. At the end of September Sir C. Spring-Rice sir C. Spring-Rice, reported that there was no prospect of any Teie^aphic, interest being paid on the British loan, that the September 27, Bushire customs had been appropriated to other purposes, and that 4,000/. of the interest just paid on the Russian loan had been furnished irom the Bushire customs. It appeared from a further telegram that the Sir C. Spring-Rice, Persian Government had paid the interest on Telegraphic, practically all its debts except the British loan. October 1, 1907. Mr. Marling was consequently instructed to To Mr.^Marling, inquire officially why the interest had remained Telegraphic, unpaid, and why the Bushire revenues had been October 11,1907. diverted, and at the same time to remind them of the conditions under which we bad consented to a suspension of the sinking fund, which still remained unanswered. On the 30th December he reported that both Mr. Marling, questions were before the I inancial Committee Telegraphic, of the Assembly, which, he believed, objected Oecember 10 , rather to the form than the substance of the stipulations respecting the sinking fund, that he would continue to press for a reply, and that he thought that the Persian Government, though in great straits for money, could probably pay the interest if strongly pressed. He subsequently Mr. Marling, reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs Telegraphic, promised to reply respecting the sinking fund 12,To Mr. Marling', No. 203, Telegraphic, December 19, 1907. in a few days, and that an effort was being made to find the money for the payment of the interest. Owing doubtless to the political crisis and Ministerial changes which then occurred, matters appear to have remained where they were. It was, however, held that, as the six months’ grace had elapsed and the interest on the Russian loan had been paid, we should now insist on the Persian Government meeting their obligations. Mr. Marling was accordingly instructed to insist, as soon as the political situation permitted, on the immediate payment of the interest; and, further, if he thought it expedient, to state that we must insist on the immediate payment of the sinking fund also unless our stipulations were accepted without further delay.

THE Governments of Great Britain and Russia, being mutually pledged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and animated by a sincere desire for the maintenance of e:ood order and pacific development throughout the Persian Empire, as wel as for the establish ment of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations, have resolved that a Convention be concluded between them in the following terms The Governments of Great Britain and Russia mutually recognize that each has, for e-eoe-raphical and economic reasons, special interest in peace and order being maintained within certain provinces of Persia contiguous with, or in proximity to, the Russian frontier on the one hand and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Beluchistan on the other; and each ot the two Governments, being impressed with the detrimental effects of local friction on their relations with Persia and with one another, is anxious to avoid all ground for interference with the special interests of each in the Persian provinces to which reference has been made above. It is therefore hereby agreed as follows :— 1. Great Britain engages not to seek or maintain for her own account, or on behalf of British subjects, any concessions of a political or commercial nature within a line and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions in that region supported by the Russian Government. v. u ir r 2. Russia, on her part, engages not to seek or maintain for her own account, or on behalt ot Russian subjects, any concessions of a political or commercial nature within a line passing from the Afghan frontier through Gazik, Birjand, Kerman and Bunder Abbas and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Beluchistan, and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications tor such concessions in that region supported by the British Government. No. 2. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 26.) (£o. Petersburgh, February 20, 1907. lf ’ M ISVOLtSKY handed me to-day a draft Convention in regard to the future mutual relations between Great Britain and Russia, which had been drawn up by the Russian Govern ment, of which I have the honour to transmit a copy. 1 did not peruse it m his presence, and accepted it without comment. I regret that I made a contusion in telegrap ing yes ay between Kuhsan and Kuchan, but the misunderstanding was due to my not catching accurate y the pronunciation of the names of the two places. , , * The preamble is identical with that of the British draft Convention, except that the word “ collision” is used in the last sentence instead of word “interference. ’As to Article II, I have, since dispatching my telegraphic summary of the Russian draft Convention, examined the draft which I communicated to M. Tsvolsky, and I find that the definition of the British line is practically identical in both documents. The observation which I made in my telegram, in regard to the words “par les fronti&amp;res de I’Afghanistan et du Beloudjistan ,' 1 was therefore made without due consideration. The final paragraph will, I presume, require some amplification and amendment. I do not know whether you would consider it necessary to specify in the Convention that the revenues of the Caspian Sea fisheries and the posts and telegraphs form securities for the British loans, but in any case it would, I submit, be right to state clearly that the customs revenues of the Fars and of the Persian Gulf are secured for the service of the British advances. As the paragraph stands there is no mention of British loans at all. I do not know whether in the Convention you would consider it desirable to mention that Mohammerah is included in the Persian Gulf ports, or to leave this debatable point alone. We could not be considered as having abandoned our views by preserving the phrase “ Fars and the Persian Gulf.” There is no mention, as from my conversation with M. Isvolsky on the 18rh instant I had been led to expect, of the maintenance of the existing Concessions in our respective zones. The omission to mention them, and as the Articles deal with the future, leads me to think that the Russian Government imply that such Concessions do continue to exist. M. Isvolsky apparently wishes to arrange the question of the two telegraph lines separately from the Convention. You may consider that there is no objection to such procedure. If, on the other hand, we desired that all Russian Bank agencies in Seistan, for instance, be withdrawn, the Russian Government might request that we should abandon Concessions in the Russian zone, and this might raise the question of the Indo-European and Indian Government telegraph lines, Imperial Bank, &amp;c. It might be wiser, pertiaps, to leave the question of existing Concessions alone, and restrict ourselves to finding outside the Convention a solution of the Meshed-Tehran and Meshed- Nasrafabad lines. I submit this view with all diffidence. When both Governments have come to an agreement as to the Convention, I do not think there would be great difficulty in arranging as to the above-mentioned telegraph lines. I should be grateful if you would kindly supply me with the final paragraph amended in the sense desired by His Majesty’s Government, so that I may communicate it to M. Isvolsky. I have, &amp;c.

No. 3. Sir A. Nicohon to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 18.) /No. 125.) g‘ r St. Petersburgh, March 10, 1907. ’ I CALLED on M. Isvolsky this morning, and said that I had brought with me a paper embodying certain amendments’ which His Majesty’s Government desired to see introduced into the draft Convention in regard to Persia, which the Russian Government had lately communicated to me. I have the honour to inclose the copy of an aide-memoire which I left with his Excellency after our conversation had concluded. I informed M. Isvolsky that His Majesty’s Government accepted the preamble of the draft Convention. In regard to the tracing of the Russian line as laid down in the draft Convention, I wished to amplify somewhat the observations which I had made to him recently on that point. He would see that’in the preamble of the Russian draft Convention it was stated that the districts in which Russia and Great Britain had special interests were those respectively boidenng on or contiguous with the Russian frontier and the frontier of Afghanistan and Beluchistan. His Majesty’s Government held the same views, and had naturally considered that the Russian zone would not include any portion of the Afghan frontier ; but if the Russian line were to terminate at a point on the Afghan frontier near to Rushan, a portion of that frontier would come within the Russian zone. As I had explained to him at my last interview on the 7th instant, such an arrangement would necessarily lead to complications. We were bound by 1 reaty both with Afghanistan and with Persia to undertake the settlement of all frontier and other questions arising between those two countries, and it was needless for me to dwell upon the difficulties which would arise if a third Power were to have special interests on the Perso-Afghan frontier. q-qj. Convention had in view the removal of all possible causes of friction 5 but if the Russian line were left as was suggested in the Russian draft Convention there would be a continual danger of difficulties arising. 1 said that I would repeat what I had said on the 7th instant, and that was that the Russian line should run from Kakhk to Zulficar, and thus obviate any of those serious risks to which I had alluded. I must tell him that my Government attached extreme importance to this matter, and, as I had said on the 7th instant, it was of small importanre to Russia, but of serious import to us, and that very possibly the Russian Government had overlooked the considerations which I urged upon him. ^ M. Isvolsky said that he recollected my observations on the 7th ifistant, and could repeat the remark that he had not himself drawn the line, and that he would examine carefully, in the light of my remarks, the modifications which I proposed. I said that I must impress on him that the rectification which I had requested was an essential one. I think that M. Isvolsky clearly saw the force of my observations, and, though he would not commit himself, I think that he will urge upon his advisers to accept the rectification which is desired. . 1 told M. Isvolsky that there was another question connected with the Russian zone on which I wished to speak to him. The Russian zone included lehran, the capital of Persia, and I must tell him frankly that if my Government were to agree that the capital of the kingdom were to be within the districts in which Russia was recognized as having special interests, a great increase of influence would accrue to the Russian Government. Indeed, my Government had originally intended to propose that Tehran should form a neutral enclave in the Russian zone; but as they were sincerely desirous of arriving at a friendly settlement, they were prepared to make a most important concession and abandon their intention, but it must be on the under standing that Russia engaged not to oppose, without previous arrangement with Great Britain, any grant of Concessions in the neutral zones of Persia to British subjects or to those of third Powers. . , . T j , M. Isvolsky inquired whether the understanding which l suggested was to be unilateral on the part of Russia, or whether Great Britain would be disposed to give a similar engagement. I told him that I had no instructions on that point, but I would mention his observation to you. His Excellency then said that he did not quite grasp the reason for demanding the engagement from Russia, nor did he see if Tehran were within the Russian zone the political situation would be greatly altered from that which existed. Our respective zones were, he observed, demarcated with a view of preventing either party from interfering within the zones of the other—a species of self-denying ordinance ; but why should anything be specially said as to other portions of Persia outside the zones? The neutral zones would, he understood, be left open to all parties, and in his view both Russia and Great Britain should preserve entire liberty of action in respect to them. I told M. Isvolsky that the concession which we were prepared to make in including Tehran within the Russian zone practically amounted to a recognition that Russia had a special interest, and consequently a special position, in the capital, and this concession was a very great one. If Russia had a special position she would eventually have special igUuence, perhaps[ 1044 ] 45 I might Bay a predominant influence, which was not the case at present. an influence might, and Ve must look into the future, hereafter be employe 1 ^ ^ Russia would be it might be employed—in opposing British Concessions in ic neu la r . • , ' , t ta ^ e placed in an admirable position for exercising such opposition, and were y d » *ak securities, in view of any future interests we might wish to acquire in the neutral “ ,at »‘« r influence and her special position should not be utilized to the detriment of those interests. Tehran governed Pereia, and this fact we must bear m mind for the future. M Isvolsky seemed to understand this point of view, as he remarked that he still did no comprehend why Russia should be asked to debar herself from opposing any Concisions to third Powers, which, if granted, might prove injurious to Russian commercial interests H'S Excefency took UO a Ilian and pointed out to me how it might be possible for Germany toi instance to endeavour to secure branch lines running from the Bagdad Railway into the neutral z o°e 8 . Was Russia to be prevented, if she thought such Concessions detrimental to her interests, from raising oSions to thlm V I observed that we did not ask that Russia should be excluded from atoototely raising objections or opposition.

HIS Britannic Majesty’s Government accept the Preamble.portion of her zone should be contiguous with Afghan territory, as would be the case it her hue terminated at the point mentioned in the draft Convention Moreover Great Britain is responsible for the external relations of Afghanistan, and is obliged, not only by I'reaty with the Ameer, but also by Article VI of the Persian Treaty of 18o7, to undertake the settlement of all frontier and other questions arising between Persia and Afghanistan. It is therefoie clear that the introduction of another Power having special interests on the Perso-Afghan frontier would tend to complicate matters and defeat the only object ot the Conyen ion. His Maiestv’s Embassy is therefore instructed to request that the Russian line should terminate at Zulficar, on the northernmost extremity of Afghanistan, and not at a p()int on the Afghan frontier near Kuhsan. His Majesty’s Embassy desires to say that His Majesty s govern ment attach great importance to this matter. . ^ xu x u- it His Majesty’s Embassy wishes to inform the Imperial Russian Government that His Majesty s Government originally intended to request that the town of Tehran as the capital and seat of the Legations, should form a neutral enclave in the Russian zone. His Majesty s Government are, however, prepared to make a most important concession by waiving this point ; but on the understanding that Russia undertakes not to oppose, without previous arrangement ™th Great Britain, any grant of Concessions in the neutral zones ot Persia to British subjects or to those ot third Powers. His Majesty’s Embassy does not doubt that the Imperial Russian Government will have no difficulty in giving the undertaking above mentioned. ARTICLE II. His Majesty’s Embassy would wish that a clause be inserted stating that all existing Concessions are maintained. At the same time, His Majesty s Embassy requests ot the telegraph line from Meshed to Nasratabad be transferred to Great Britain, and is ready to agree that the control over the Tehran-Meshed telegraph line be transferred to Russ a. The transfer shall be effected by an exchange of notes, to be signed simultaneously with the Gcnvenhon. Emb deeires tlwt the , ast paragraph of Article II be amplified; and snggests the following addition should be made ; “It is equally understood that the revenues of the Persian customs of Farsistan and the Persian Gulf, as well as those of the Caspian fisheries and of posts and telegraphs, shall be devoted, as in the past, to the service of loans concluded by the Government of the Shall with the Imperial Bank ot eisia. x&gt; His Majesty’s Embassy desires to mention one more point.

Great Britain would be prepared to undei take the coilectron and remission to Russia of the due proportion of customs revenues which may be affected to Russian loans in the British zone, if the Imperial Government would agree to a similar arrangement as regards the revenues in the Russian zone which may be pledged to British loans.

Convention concerning Persia. I explained to his Excellency that I had drawn up Articles III, IV, and V for the sake o convenience, and that it seemed to me that wo were now practically vorv near the termination of the Convention respecting Persia. His Excellency agreed with me, and said that he must study the paper which I had left with him before giving a reply; and there was still the question of the two telegraph lines. I observed that I had submitted a draft Declaration on that subject to him, and was awaiting his reply. He said that there were one or two points connected with that question which he would probably have to mention to me, but that he did not desire to enter upon it at this moment. I said that he would observe in the draft Articles which I now communicated no mention was made of “zones or “spheres,’ as it was desirable to avoid employing those terms which might give rise to misapprehension. His Excellency appeared to agree with this view. HIS Majesty s Embassy had the honour to receive the pro-rnemorid of the Imperial Russian Go\ eminent, dated the 20th March ( 2 nd April), 1907, in reply to the aide-memoire^ which was com municated by His Majesty’s Embassy on the 25th February ( 10 th March). The Imperial Govern ment points out in its above-mentioned pro-memorid that the right of control over the Persian Customs, in case of non-payment of the coupons, has been ceded to the Russian Government, by virtue of a contract concluded with the Persian Government, and that therefore it is necessary to decide whether that right could be ceded to a third Power, and whether the Persian Government would be justified in protesting against such a transaction. His Majesty’s Embassy would bog to poinb out uiat me parry to wnom trie collection ot the nlcugod revenues was intrusted would merely be acting as the Agent of the other, and it would therefore not Appear that the Persian Government would have any right to object to such a proceeding. 1 he Imperial Government also desired to be informed as to what rights His Majesty's Government possess of taking action in the event of the non-payment of the interest on liritish loans: and, consequently, what would be the responsibility incurred by the Russian Government should this contingency arise. His Majesty’s Embassy beg leave to observe that the loan contracts concluded by the Imperial Bank of Persia with the Persian Government do not expressly provide tor such a case, but th : right of control in the event of non-payment may he held to follow inherently from the hypothecation of the revenues. The pro-memorid of the 20th March ( 2 nd April) further remarked that it would h&lt; desirable to omit all mention of “third parties” in regard to Concessions in the neutral zones. His Majesty’s Embassy is authorized to agr* e with this omission, and also to reciprocally engage not to oppose, without a previous understanding with the Russian Government, the grant of Concessions to Russian subjects in thore neutral zones. His Majesty’s Embassy would therefore sugg^t the following Articles connected with the above subjects, and which would be numbered Articles III, IV, and V of the proposed draft Convention. Articles I and JI refer to the respective spheres, and on tb&lt; *e an accord has already been reached, provided that the Russian Government consent to the rectification of the hue of the Russian sphere of influence, as requested bv His Majesty's Government, viz. that d should tem.inat'. :i.» Xulfirm, mid not :it point. ; M Russia, on her part, further engages not fo &lt;/pp&lt;*s£. without previous arrangi-meut with Great Britain, any grant of Concsssimts to British subjects in the regions of Persia, outside of the lines mentioned in Articles I and If, Great Britain undertakes a similar eugagemMid n* fogatrii the grant of Conuensiuns to Russian subjects in the same region* of K-rstii.

Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 21.) (No. 261. Confidential.) A „ St. Petersburgh, May 15, 1907. M. 1SVOLSKY told me to-day that he had been, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance, examining the proposals which I had communicated to him in regard to the collection and remission of the pledged revenues in the respective British and Russian zones in the event of the Persian Government defaulting in the payment of the coupons ol the British and Russian loans. He considered that it was not likely that there would be any default; but, assuming that such would occur, it seemed to him that, in view of the state of the feeling in Persia, it would be undesirable to state in the Convention precisely the measures which the two Governments would take in such an eventuality. There was further the difficulty in regard to the British loans that in the loan contract there was no clause which specified exactly the measures which should be adopted in the event of default as was the case in the Russian loan contracts. Suppose, for instance, there was a default, and that the Russian authorities stepped into the post and telegraph offices and claimed to receive the revenues on behalf of the British loans, basing their intervention not on any written engagement in the loan contract, but on an implied right. Such action might give rise to serious difficulties. He was therefore inclined to state in the Convention, in lieu of what we had proposed, that in the eventualities above mentioned the two Governments would exchange views as to the measures to be taken, and thereby the risk of prematurely, and possibly unnecessarily, arousing at the outset popular feeling would be avoided. He would communicate to me in a few days the amendments which he had in view. I told his Excellency that in my opinion his observations had considerable justification, but this was merely my personal view, and that I would await his communication and then ascertain the views of my Government.

(No. 225.) Sir, Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. I HA\ E received your Excellency’s despatch No. 277 of the 2 ord ultimo, forwarding copy of a private letter from the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which was inclosed an Article which his Government desire to substitute for Article V of the draft Anglo-Russian Convention respecting Persia proposed by His Majesty’s Government. I now transmit to your Excellency herewith a revised draft Convention, embodying certain modifications which, after further consideration, His Majesty’s Government would desire to see introduced into that Agreement. Your Excellency will observe that most of the modifications made affect the preamble of the instrument. For the expression “to maintain order and peaceful development throughout the whole extent of the Persian Empire” has been substituted the phrase “for the preservation, &amp;c.” This alteration has been made in consequence of the opinion expressed by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his despatch No. G9 of the 11 th April, that the original wording might be held to imply an intention on the part of the two Governments to arrogate to themselves the right of maintaining order in the dominions of the Shah, and that such an expression cannot fail to produce an unfortunate effect on the minds of the Persian Government and people. Although, as your Excellency is well aware, the two Governments have, in fact, no such intention, it seems nevertheless desirable to remove the possibility of any such misunderstanding, and it is hoped that the phrase which it is now proposed to employ will effect this object. In the second paragraph of the preamble it has been thought well to insert a reference to the special interest of Great Britain in the maintenance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf. This clause has been added in view of the strong and explicit declarations of my predecessor on this subject, which is evidently one of paramount importance to Great Britain. It is felt that the omission from the present Agreement of any mention of this point would make a bad impression on public opinion in this country, and seriously affect the popularity of the Agreement when concluded. His Majesty’s Government therefore press for the insertion of these words in the preamble, in order to secure that the Agreement, when announced in this country, should be accepted from the first by both parties with goodwill. In Article I the words “ at a point on the Persian frontier adjoining the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers” have been substituted for the words “on the Afghan frontier near Zulfikar.” This change has been introduced at the suggestion of the India Office, who have pointed out that Zulfikar is well within the territory of Afghanistan. The substituted wording has the further advantage of emphasizing the fact that the end of the line defining the Russian sphere lies in Persia, and not in Afghanistan. Articles II, III, and IY of the Russian draft are retained unaltered. [1044] OThe draft Article put forward by the Russian Government in place ol the British Article V is iccepted, with the addition, at the end, of the following clause “ And to avoid all interference in the respective spheres which would not be in conformity with the principles governing the present Convention.” These words have been inserted in order specifically to exclude all possibility of the exercise by Russia of her right of control over such of the sources of revenue affected to the service of the Russian loans in Persia as lie within the British sphere in the event of irregularity occurring in the service of those loans, as foreseen in the Article. . , , M1 The Article has also been subjected to a few verbal alterations, which, it is thought, will render its sense more explicit. , . n x i i In communicating to M.

No. 10. Foreign Office, June 21, 1907. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (No. 89.) (Telegraphic.) P. PERSIAN Convention. . I have received your Excellency’s despatch No. 306 of the bth instant. „ . , As regards the preamble, we w’ish the words “ aussi bien que . . . . nations retained. Their omission might seem to reserve parts of Persia for exploitation exclusively by Russia and Great Britain, and thereby the Convention would be exposed to criticism both Pe J^aii d also in every country which has commercial dealings with Persia, more especially the G Empire. By Articles I and II Russia and Great Britain are specifically prevented from seeking Concessions, &amp;c., in the other country’s sphere. In order, therefore, to .make the preamble consistent with these Articles, we propose to replace the words toutes les nations by expression “ toutes les autres nations.’ A . . We are willing that the words “constatant .... entre eux-memes be omitted In my despatch No. 225 of the 6 th instant I inclosed our draft which meets the remaining objections, but if M. Isvolsky is insistent we are prepared to adopt the Russian text. ' As regards Article I, the change in Russian line as proposed cannot be accepted, as it oul l bring line too near to frontier of Afghanistan. Same objections can be urged against proposed chaifge as against original proposal—that terminal point of line should be at Knhsan (please refei on this subiect to my telegram No. 20 of the 8 th March of this year). Criticism of a hostile nature would most assuredly be excited m this col jntry by the compromise which the Russian Government now propose, and an atmosphere would thereby be created unfavourable to the Agreement. It is to the general interest to avoid such things. Nevertheless, you may state that, if maintenance of Karez sanitary station is considered indianpnsable bv Russian Government, no objection will be raised by us if Imperial Government, on S part! a^reeToTto disturb pr’esent arrangement, which places under British control the quarantine o^n Persian Gulf. ^ I y &gt; amendments proposed by Russian Government appear to be unob^ectumable^ communicate to R us 8 i a n Government (when you inform them of our views resoectin«-their amendments) our amendments also, which I suggested m my despatch No. 225. respecting tneir am ' , , eguec i a u v to those in w hich maintenance of status quo RS? kL, to intersection ot Russian and Afghan fronts^.lefined^ ^ ^ of Articl6 v&gt; which has been received.

Confidential.) ^ Petersburgh, June 24, 1907. Sir ’ I CA 1 T ED bv aonointment on M. Isvolsky this afternoon, and said that I was prepared to ^ • 1 i rviiots of Hi« M iiestv’s Government to the modifications which he bad communicate to him tne replies * .] y i told bis Fxcellencv that my Government suggested in the draft Convention concerning ei • • , nf i IV and that they further agreed hafuccepted the amendments proposed m Artrdes^ friftion. rM^e^GoUttnt^^etdi^d to retain the clause concerning equal opportnn.tiesJ\ 55 for the commerce and industry of all nations, but in view of the observations made in his aide- memoire of the 5th June, and in order to render the passage consistent with Articles I and II, they would suggest that the words “all other countries ” should be substituted for “all countries.” I said that there was one other point to which His Majesty’s Government attached great importance, and which I did not doubt that the Russian Government would make no difiiculty in accepting, and that was, that a clause should be inserted in the Preamble referring to the special interests which Great Britain had in the maintenance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf. This was a matter in which British public opinion took a great interest, and my Government considered it to be necessary, in order to satisfy the feeling in my country and to assist in the general acceptance of the Convention, that some mention should be formally made of the fact. In Article I there was also a modification which I most propose, and that was in regard to the tracing of the Russian line from Kakh northwards. We had assumed, naturally, that the line would run direct from Kakh to its terminus at a point near the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers, but, in the aide-memoire of the 5th June, the line, as traced, made a considerable deviation eastwards, and ran close along the Afghan frontier. To this tracing, the same objections must be raised as were formulated in regard to the Russian line terminating near Kuhsan, and I repeated to his Excellency the nature of the objections which had been made on thut occasion. I told his Excellency that he would find these points set forth in the aide-memoire which I begged leave to hand to him, and of which I have the honour to inclose a copy. M. Isvolsky said that a very serious question was raised by the proposed insertion of a clause relative to the status quo in the Persian Gulf, and that he had the gravest doubts if the Russian Government could consent to its being interpolated. He did not himself wish to contest that Great Britain had special and predominant interests in the Gulf, hut he wished to explain at once to me how the question presented itself at first sight to him. During all our discussions regarding the Persian Convention, both Governments had strictly limited themselves to treating of matters which concerned themselves alone, and which neither directly nor indirectly affected the interests of other Powers. These wise restrictions would exclude any other Power from having any justification hereafter to complain that the two negotiating countries had dealt with, or touched upon, interests other than their own. At the last moment, Great Britain proposed to enlarge the scope of the Agreement, and to extend it to a question which it was known was in a sense a controversial one, and which did touch upon the interests of others. It could not be denied that Turkey and Germany did not admit to the full our contentions as to the Persian Gulf, and if the clause were inserted, and Russia subscribed to it, he feared that an embarrassing situation would hereafter arise. The clause had a far-reaching effect, and he could not foretell what consequences; and he did not understand why, if the matter were of such importance to us, it had not been brought forward earlier. The Convention as drawn up between us, and in regard to which he had hoped only some secondary details had to be settled, was chiefly directed to avoiding all possible causes of friction between the two Powers, and related solely to our respective frontiers ; and he regretted that we should now wish to raise a delicate and important question which was mixed up with other controversial matter. He would only mention for the moment the Bagdad Railway and Koweit. I told M. Isvolsky that I perfectly appreciated the force of his argument that-the question had been raised at *a late hour; but I would tell him frankly that there was likely to be opposition from some quarters in Great Britain and India to our Agreement, and that as it was desirable to modify such opposition and procure as general acceptance as possible of the Convention, my Government, after careful consideration, had desired to refer to a matter in which the British public took a very keen interest. I did not deny that the proposal came late in the dav, but many would consider that a Convention about Persia with no mention of the Persian Gulf was deficient. Moreover, I did not see why the Russian Government should hesitate to subscribe to a proposition which was incontrovertible. We did not ask Russia to take any action, nor did we attempt to bind her in respect to other countries. We stated an undoubted fact, which was surely universally recognized, which had been affirmed over and over again, and very emphatically by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords in 1903. M. Isvolsky said he doubted that the recognition of the fact was so universal as I had stated, and he was perfectly well aware of our views on the subject, and also of Lord Lansdowues statement. He strongly demurred, however, to introducing fresh factors into the Agieemen, especially at a moment when the negotiations were on the point ot being terminated. What should we have said if Russia had suddenly sprung upon us a request to recognize her special interests in Armenia, for instance? , . , ^ . ., i i (.i i I replied that the Persian Gulf was closely connected with Persia, as it washed the whole of the Bouthem littoral of that country. His Excellency remarked that it washed the coasts of other countries as well. But all this was beside the mark. He adjured me to take mto consideration the serious consequences of opening up this question. He was most oo'uld assure me that it would be dangerous to delay their CO 1 1- _ xZ ?-■. - existent in this country and outside ol it. Ihere had been one or know had been di lines we had origi hitherto we had both scrupulously observed, but I must remember that Russia had a powerfu whiciTl m^-know had been displeasing to Beifin He could with safety conclude our Convention on the hues we had original y di awn, and which tberto we had “both scrupulously observed, but I must remember that Russia had a powerful dghbour alert and watchful, who had her eyes fixed on that very quarter of which we now IcLxrl frx formal mention in our Convention in a form which could not but produce neig which in any rase would prolong the discussions, and this, he must repeat to me, would be most dangerous.5(5 I said that, of course, I would report to you all his observations as faithfully as possible, but that I could by no means say if they would induce my Government to abandon their request. M IsvoTsky made a slight gesture of despair, and I asked him if he could tell me, leaving the immediate question on one side, when he hoped to sign the Conventions. , , His Excellency took an almanac, and said that he hoped to be able to give me replies to both Persian and Afghan questions by the 3rd July (NS.). I obseived that it he did this and that, as my Government was as desirous as himself to hasten the conclusion, I proposed, in or ler expedite matters, to take his replies home and discuss them with you, and return m about a fortnight say, on the 25th July, and then we could finally settle all Conventions His Excellency begged me not k, adopt th ,8 plan, but to stay here eo that we might mgn the Convention on Ae 15th July. I was a little surprised at this promptness, but I told his Excellency that, ot course, 1 would remain here till the negotiations were finally concluded. „ , _ . r , . , ^ His Excellency then reverted to the question of the tracing of the Russian line, and I told him that on that point it was really essential that their line on leaving Kakh should not deviate to the eastwards ; it should run straight to the point in the corner near Zulficar. 1 said that if the Russian Government laid great stress on having Karez as a sanitary station we would be prepared not to object to that, but on condition that they engaged not to interfere with the existing arrangement by which the quarantine in the Persian Gulf was under British control. M Isvolsky said that again on this question there entered a reference to the Persian Gulf which he desired to keep out of the Convention. Moreover, he thought that the compromise was a little one-sided. We gave to them permission to establish a sanitary station at one place and then required an acknowledgment on their part of our control over several localities. I oh8e ™ e( * that all that we requested was the admission of an arrangement already in force, while we were wdling to cede a point only in contemplation. His Excellency said that he wished to think over this ^ impressed by two facts in my conversation with M. Isvolsky: (1) his anxiety to excludlfromconXatln any matters affecting the Persian Gulf, as he evidently anticipates and fears that if we insist upon the inclusion in the Preamble of the draft Convention ot a recognition of our special interest in the maintenance of the status quo m that region, Germany will fxWbR in some form or another her displeasure at Russia having met our wishes in that respect It is perfectly clear to me that M. Isvolsky will not run the risk of impairing in the slightest degree the good relations between Russia and Germany, especially at a time when Russia has not yet emerged from her internal difficulties or repaired the losses which she has suffered in a disastrous campaign. The second fact is that M. Isvolsky is exceedingly eager to hasten on as rapidly as possible the conclusion of the negotiations. On this point 1 have not teen him, during the progress of our discussions, so emphatic or so eager. It was evident to me that either in home circles or outside something had occurred which had impressed on him the urgent necessity ° f 10 Hi g these^chcumXnces, I venture to submit that we should not insist upon points which may either delay the conclusion of the negotiations or which may even imperil their ultimate success Leaving on one side public opinion either in Russia or in England which probably will not be a constant factor, and regarding simply the enormous advantage to be ac quired bj the cessation of the rivalries and disputes which for so many years have strained and endangered the relations between the two countries, and the inestimable benefits to be gained by an amicable understanding between the two Great Powers in Asia, I would suggest that it would be most regrettable if an opportunity which may never recur should be lost, and if, ow - to insistence on points which are not of vital importance, the hopes ot a durable arrangement were to be disappointed. It seems to me that by the Conventions, even as they ft present stand, we have secured all the guarantees which are necessary to the safety of our Indian frontiers; and that we have removed to a reasonable distance the danger ot Russian aggression. As regards the Persian Gulf, even admitting that the approach to those waters is no? definitely barred—and in present circumstances this could hardly be achieved we ha for the defence of our interests in those regions our naval preponderance with which no Power can compete. In order, therefore, to profit by the present eagerness of M Isvolsky to put his seal to the arrangements on which we have practically already come to an agicement, I would respectfully urge that w-e should be conciliatory on minor details, and even on a question of public sentiment^ and lose no time in finally concluding negotiations which have lasted for so many months. j have&gt; &amp;c Inclosure in No. 11.

Sir. Foreign Office, August 29, 1907. I HAVE to-day authorized your Excellency by telegraph to sign a Convention with the Russian Government containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. The Arrangement respecting Persia is limited to the regions of that country touching the respective frontiers of Great Britain and Russia in Asia, and the Persian Gulf is not part of those regions, and is only partly in Persian territory. It has not therefore been considered appropriate to introduce into the Convention a positive declaration respecting special interests possessed by Great Britain in the Gulf, the result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years. His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to difficulties between the two Governments should developments arise which make further discus sion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. For the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf—a statement of which His Majesty's Government have formally taken note. In order ta make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them. His Majesty’s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preservation of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of British trade; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power.
