Sir Percy Sykes’s Position. Viceroy'* Telegram of 28th February 1017. Note hy Political Secretary, India Office. The Political Department cannot very greatly mitigate the force of the Oovernnient of India’s indictment—in fact the main points in it had already been, made here. But there are perhaps one or two things that may be said. To take the counts seriatim : - (1) There is no doubt that Sir P. Sykes misjudged the situation at Kerman and on the road, and it was a serious error of judgment to entrust 14 European prisoners to the keeping of 20 sowars (afterwards increased en route to 23 prisoners and 30 sowars). The facts are as follows . The party consisted of 14 prisoners and three or four servants, escorted by 20 sowars under a “reliable Persian,” and left Kerman on 15th July. In Sirjan (probably at Saidabad) it was to be joined by nine more prisoners and the escort to be increased by 10. From Saidabad it was to proceed to Daulatabad (08 miles), where it was due on 2nd August, and was to be met by (1) 10 Persian sowars who had escorted Major lx)rimer to Kerman and were to wait at Daulatabad on their way back to Bunder Abbas; (2) a regular escort brought over from Muscat, consisting of 40 Indian rank and tile under one British and one Indian officer, and 13 Persian sowars under a Persian officer. ’ They left Bunder Abbas on 22nd July and were due at Daulatabad one day before the prisoners, but the Chief of the Ceneral Staff, Simla, had directed (16th July) that they should relieve the Kerman escort as far up the line as possible—so apparently they were not to wait at Daulatabad. Chief of General Staff, Simla, had pointed out to Sir P. Sykes on 13th July that it was most important that the prisoners should have no chance of escape, .and said that the escort should be under a British officer. Sir P. Sykes replied that neither a British officer nor regular troops could be spared, and that, on the other hand, it was unsafe for the prisoners to remain at Kerman after he himself had left (which he did on 26th July). Again on 18th July, Chief of General Staff telegraphed :—“ It is presumed you realise “ great importance of ensuring that none of the prisoners escape, and that “ for this purpose you are satisfied that your orders and arrangements are “ adequate.” Sir P. Sykes replied next day, “ I made best arrangement I “ could, realising importance of matter.” On 23rd August they were rescued from Saidabad by Husain Khan and 50 of the democratic party. (2) This is rather vague but not an unfair description. (3) In the five weeks that ( lapsed between 23rd November and 31st .’December, a great deal happened. But first as to his “optimism.” His telegram of 23rd November merely says “ Farman Farma confident can “ re-establish authority of Persian Government to Bushire which we might ‘ ‘ possibly visit.” His despatch of 25th November describes in rather glowing terms his arrival at Shiraz (where Farman Farma and Colonel Gough had arrived a month earlier), but concludes with this warning:—“ In conclusion, “ Sir, 1 consider that the situation justified some optimism, but it would be “ unwise to ignore the fact that hostility in Pars is stronger than at Kerman “ an( ] that the presence of the column alone enables the restoration of order “to make solid headway.” His despatch of Jth December does not deal with the political situation, but gives his impressions of the gendarmerie whom he had taken over at Shiraz, and ends thus:—“ In conclusion, I am “ favourably impressed with the force which I have taken over. There willbe many difficulties to overcome, but I am confident of ultimate sue “ provided that the Indian column is kept at my disposal until the “ force is ready to light the tribes, and that I am given, when available The “ most modern instruments of war in the shape of aerophines 1 anuonrH “ motor ears, and perhaps even a ‘ Tank.’ , ' 1 Farman Farma and Colonel Gough had arrived at Shiraz on loth Octob'- -(“reception accorded” (the latter telegraphed) “was enthusiastic 'ami everything very satisfactory ”). On 23rd Colonel Gough reported “situation generally satisfactory,' and though there was a .scarcity of foodstuffs nothiim in his telegrams suggests cause for anxiety before Sir P. Sykes’s arrival on 12th November. But shortly after his arrival the scarcity became acute and was used by the hostile elements as a stick to boat Farman Farina and Iris British advisers. Moreover, Sir P. Sykes’s position was difficult, because though he had taken over the gendarmerie, the Persian Government refused to instruct Farman Farma to recognise the fact officially. Soulet’s attitude too, was doubtful. On 11th December, Colonel Gough telegraphed that the price of bread was rising daily and that “we are threatened with serious disturbances.’ On 17th December the Kalantar of Kazerun attacked the gendarmerie force of 100 men and captured them and their gun and after seeing Farman Farina, with Colonel Gough, Sir P. Sykes decided to a 0 out with the majority of his column to “ strike hard and at once ” (Colonel Gou&lt;ffi 18th Decern tier). Next day, however, Colonel Gough reported that “in view of somewhat unsettled conditions here he is not moving out yet.” In this attack Sou let was certainly implicated and the Qawam’s principal a mm t a fact which threw some doubt on the loyalty of the Qawam. On 21st December the rebels followed up their success by capt u ring the small gendarmerie post at Daslitarjin, and Sir l\ Sykes sent out 200 regular infantry with 2 mountain guns and 100 gendarmerie with 3 mountain guns to recapture it (the rebels being reported to number 400). This force advanced to Dashtarjin without opposition on 24th December, but next day was obliged to evacuate it, with considerable loss, to escape being surrounded. “Effect of retirement on public opinion will be very bad indeed,” Sir P. Sykes telegraphed on 26th December. It was in these circumstances that he sent his “pessimistic” telegram of olst December, which runs as follows : — . •, . ' , oneugimms \ icw mai we are opposed D tribes Fars and strong party in Shiraz hostile to introduction law ani &lt; i ei m i e s, and especially hostile to Indian troops.

(ti) The reference is to the despatch of 9th December quoted above As I have said, lie has no sense of humour. ’ D) The reference is to the evacuation of IWnarjin. If Sir l&gt; Svkes’s own statement is correct, the force sent, was as stated above-2wttn infantry and 100 «endarniene. The reason win- he did not oo ,,u.

Sykes is apparently responsible for the smallness of the gendarmerie force (100 men) originally stationed at Kazerun. i.S) 00 This charge cannot be sustained in full. Note the dates:— I 'tli December. Capture of Kazerun by rebels -Oth December. Sir I'. Sykes asks for 200 infantrv. 21st, becember. (-apture of Dashtarjiu 22nd December. Sir P.

Evacuation of Dashtarjin (“effect on public opinion will be very bad indeed ”). 1 Oth •January. Sir P. Sykes asks for 1,000 infantrv “ in view of serious political situation and large size caravan.” ' But this last remark does show that, as the Government of India say when he was content to ask for 200 men he “ showed disregard of the danger or an inadequately guarded convoy.” (b) As regards his reiterated demand for immediate action, it mav be said in his defence that he was familiar with Russian military methods;and that the Russians, when then' is a serious emergency’ such he believed (wrongly, as it turned out) to exist, do not spend a great deal of time on preparations,’ but move quickly. What the Government of India mean v dispersion of force in thio connection I do not understand. 3rd March 1917. I.S.—When the above wa&gt; written, the Viceroy's telegram of 1st March had not been seen m the Political Department. We were, indeed, aware from the Government of India’s telegram of 14th February (“ Ways aud Means ), that they had budgeted for 6OO,000L in the present year, and estimated for the same amount in 1917-18, and we were so alarmed that we telegraphed at once for details to be sent by mail. It seemed incredible that 600,000/. could be spent in a year on a force which, on 1st April 1916, did not exist, and on 1st November numbered only 3,000, especially as we*had rejected a grandiose scheme of barrack construction, and the Secretary of State in July last, whilst saying that it would be a mistake to economise in British officers, had generally enjoined “ all possible economy.” Jt is obvious that a force which is eventually to be paid for by the Persian Government must not be launched on extravagant lines. The present telegram suggests that the 600,000/. includes the whole cost of the regular force that is with Sir P. Sykes, and of its operations. If that is so, on the one hand it is not clear what basis he had for estimating 1,000,000/. for next year, and on the other the Viceroy’s last remark about the strength and quality of the South Persian Rifles is a little misleading. It is clear, however, that a great deal too much .money is being spent, and that Sir P. Sykes’s accounts ought to lie audited.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000158_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C162</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000158</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C162</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Sir Percy Sykes's Position.
