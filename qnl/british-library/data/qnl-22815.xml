Copies have been forwarded separately. enclosure to the letter under reference my answers are as follov/s:- bu Jhamis, 3ee ^ note of the LTa’im tribe. This section are Haliki and Ha^bmli Sunnis, not Nahabis. The Sill tan thinks that having had an unpleasant historical association with Wahabi invaders these and other Buraimi tribes would not wish to come under Saudi suzerainty. On religious grounds^they should be ovnosed, ly second liunshi v/ho is a tribesman believe* that some Zakat may still be paid by or extorted from the Buraimi people, including this tribe but we have no evidence of this. The al bu Shamis^ Shaikh, as far as we knew; is ]johai;t:iad Din Salmin bin la’imah, and he has made overtures to the Sultan - he may equally be making overtures to others : money is a powerful incentive - more so tlian religion.* and other ties these days^perhaps, • he -waj.lr . I cannot reply to the first sentence. As far as T can say my note on this tribe read also with Lorimer covers the whole position. The Bedouin section roams the whole Sultanate border of the hub al Qali from Buraami (even to Sharjah) to Dhufar, They probably admit allegiance to no one. The settled portion j i occi Sultanate (or the Imai * s) ter itory vis Oman proper, Huscat and Batinah districts. Their paramount Shaikh . is KhamLs bin Rashid bin Nasir and he resides in the Qala'— ^Lt.€LUiwaiair or w/arir Port or at -Aqil (I cannot make certain if --qil^ qali end ^ala’at are not all one and the same and relate to one place). I doubt if the Bedouins migrate st^ and if the settled portions move at all it would be into the higher regions inside the Sultanate and to the Batinah. They definitely acknowledge Sultanate authority as recently in a fight with the Howasinah the h'ali of liusna’ah arranged a seven months* truce and now the Sultan’s return and final decision is awaited. I was told this by one of the Howasinah Shaikhs and the i.ali, who is the Sultan’s brother, during ny recent toutv 2 I have now got out a note on the Omani tribes which 3 Dealing specifically with the questions asked in the The JanabahThe Janabah I would not say that the Bani bu -^li have such great influence over the Janabah. They are in alliimnce, though Jajiabah are Sunnis, and Bani Bu Ali converged ffhabis. Tlie former Shaildi Ali of the B ni Bu --li defied the Sultan and was brought to heel with our assistance - see ny notes - in 1932. -'any of the Janabah Shaikhs are those &gt;e me&lt; t in Sur and though they try to dodge** customs they recognise the Sultan all right, and lie has Visited them recently. A1 Daru . As far as I can discover, and ry 2nd llunshi is sure of it, al Riqais]ii, Shaikh of Ibri / is a Vali appointed by the imam. I doubt if the tribe has paid JfrJcat to Ibn Sand for years since the physical occupation by the 'Jahabis in the first half of the 19 th century and anyhow after 1870 (see Lorimer Historical Volume I Part I page 485). Bani Qitab Aflaj Bani Qitab is in Dhabi rah district, which kas^ldJtoe the Districts of Ru’tfs al Jibal, Batinah, Oman xiroper, etc y always been held to f om part of the territories of the Sultanate of uscat and Oman. The border^as also generally accepted hitherto has been^ on the Jest sidejrthe desert sands of the R-gb al Qali. Bhanl, Yanlcul Aflaj Bani Qitab/ Ibri etc. : are villages in the foot-hills of the ©stem Ha.iar Range. I cannot comment on the bu Dhabi tribes in the Buraimi area, nor on the smaller tribes (llos 11 to 21) unless I am given the names of the latter. If Sultanate tribes they will be found in my notes or Lorimer. As you have asked for an early report I have had to write this somewhat hastily. I hope it will be adequate. Yours sincerely, His lajesty* s Consul, 'uscat.This information should be treated only as supplementary to the much more extensive and ably compiled notes contained in Loris*m r s Gazetteer ( 1905 ), and the latter should invariably be nonsuited when more detailed information is required. These notes are in fact iperely an attempt to bring the information more up to date* They are neither exhaustive nor # as indicated, can their accuracy be vouched for, though where there is a sharp difference from previous accounts, such steps as are possible have been taken to check up on the information. Figures of population and rifles must necessarily be estimates of the crudest kind, and the stated tendencies of the tribes may be no more than the hopes of . the informants. It will be noted that for the most part the population ’ has considerably decreased. This is scarcely surprising since, apart from epidemics, which, though cholera and plague have taken severe toll, have been mercifully few, there has been a constant exodus in recent times to ‘the oil fields and the Muscat Consulate has for some years issued visas on .Omani passports at the rate of some three thousand a year. From these [revised estimates it will be seen that the tribal population of the Sultan* 'ate may be less than two hundred thousand, and, with the cosmopolitwi population of the coastal towns, inoluding Muscat, Mutrah and Gwadur, the whole population of the Sultanate is probably not in excess of three hundred thousand, and former estimates of half a million are very likely excessive. The Sultan himself, though frequently approached, either through genuine ignorance or an unexplained desire for secrecy, has supplied no Information of value, though few persons can have had better opportunity for accumulating knowledge through actual contact than his present Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim. His officials are no more helpful in this matter and information must be gleaned despite them /rather than with their assistance. i • For a better understanding of these notes a brief enumeration i of the provinces or districts of the Sultanate may be helpful here. To 5 : the north covering the whole tip of the Oman promontory is the Ruus al : Jibal. Southward (omitting Shamailiyah which is not Sultanate territory) • is the Hatinah - the coastal plain reaching down almost to Muscat* West ..J of the Batinah is Western Hajar, which includes the Jibal Akhdar mountain '‘orange. , Further inland is BHAHIRAH and, somewhat north, the Jluraimi and Mahadhah tracts, both of doubtful ownership. South and Fast lie Eastern Ha^ir and Sharqiyah, and then following the coast southward, Jala*an, Batadn and, finally, at the southernmost extremity, adjoining the Hadramaut of the Aden Protectorate, Dhofar, \ The present situation is one of general peace, with the Sultan’s influence slightly increasing in the coastal districts, e.g. Batinah, ‘'Dhofar and Sharqiyah , and far better established than in his father's day. ;It seems a pity that all his Walis are selected from his own tribe and are often near relations. In Oman proper and Dhahihrah, and East and West Hajar, the Triumvirate continue their rule, and when it comes to it, it sterns that the vote will almost certainly be for continuation of the Imamship in a person other than the Sultan, otherwise this independence will be lost, and at present the most likely candidate, and one who certain quarters insist, has already been nominated, is the eldest son of the previous Imam, Yahya bin Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, aged at present about forty* However,..though seventy two and despite recurring rumours of failing health, the present Imam is by no means yet dead or even dying. r .1 ■ A still more4 .
