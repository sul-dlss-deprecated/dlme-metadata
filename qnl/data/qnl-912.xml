The visit was primarily for medical reasons for the treatment of chronic appendicitis, detailed in medical reports contained in the file. He desired to be accompanied by his Wazir, Bertram Thomas, and letters discuss that it was not advisable for both the Sultan and his Wazir to be absent from Muscat at the same time. Correspondence discusses the arrangements for the expenses incurred on the trip. Also included are letters in Arabic from Sultan Taimur bin Faisal to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which also discuss the Sultan's desire to abdicate.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Financial Advisor to the Sultan of Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Royal visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019d#share">Non-commercial use only</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
