Baroda due 15.00 hours 12th June.1 As instructed by the Head Clerk I respectfully beg to report as follows:- I had been keeping my money in my table drawer which is always locked. In the month of April last I had money of different accounts in the same locked drawer as detailed below:- In one cover Rs.14/- ' »t m ..... Rs. 25/3/- M M ” F: .40/- II ,1 cigarette tin.. Rs.24/14/- tr n t« m Rs. 20/- On 20th April I checked the money and found correct. Before the closing of the office I kept fresh chits duly checked and initials by me in each account and locked the drawer as usual. On 22nd April I had to send Rs.14/- to the Electric Deptt: for which I tried to open the drawer but could not do it. It appeared that the lock was interfered with. As I was busy that day I could not send the money but on the morning of 23rd April I tried again'and succeeded in opening it with some difficulty. On checking each account I found R .40/- in total missing from the different accounts as mentioned below:- From the account of Rs.14/- ------ Rs. 10-0-0 n tt tt tr r s# 24/14/- . ” 21-0-0 tt Tt Tt tt Rs.20/- - — ' 9-0-0 total... ' 40-0-0 As the drav/er was found locked, I did not suspect anybody and therefore did not report in writing but mentioned to H.C. and I.A. verbally that I lost Rs.40/-^ from my drawer in total from different accounts. I put the ftosh money from my pocket and made up the accounts but stopped keeping money in the drawer since that -day. * How I am keeping trie money i the safe with H.C. oi -i ^ -After receiving ray pay for the month of March 1933, I kept a sum of Rs.20/- in the drawer of my table for payment of Sports club subscription and other petty expenses. The money was put in a cover, which i placed among other papers in the drawer. Three or four days after the club-boy came for subscription e,s usual and I opened the drawer but to my surprise I found the cover empty. There is no doubt that the pei'son who removed the money is in possession of a duplicate key as I found the drawer locked when I opened it. As I could not suspect anyone for the pffence, I did not report the matter to the Political Agent but only talked to the Head Munshi and advised myself to be more careful in future . I have not since kept any money in the drawer.IThrough Head Clerk I respectfully beg to report as follows On Thursday the 8th March 1934 I received Rs.15/- with a closed cover from the Commandant, State Police. The cover was sent to you and the amount was kept with me in the Cash when Box. This morning(the 10th March 1934)/! opened my cash box to pay some money to Head Clerk, I found Rs.il/- instead of Rs.15/- in the cash box. The cash box as well as Almirah are always locked by me and today they were found locked when I wanted to open them. 2. I had kept in the same cash box another amount of Rs.27/ on account of passports recovered from various persons but found Rs.7/- only instead of Rs.27/-. 3. Suspecting some foul play I checked my postage account and found Rs.6/- less from this account also. The total shortage thus amounts to Rs.30/-. I am also checking the remaining accounts and will submit a separate report in due course. I doubt that somebody among our peons has got a duplicate key or something else by which he can easily open my Almirah as well as the cash box to enable him to steal money without being detected. Bahrain. The 10th March 1934. I.A. As P.A. is very busy to-day, the above is submitted to-you. As ordered verbally by P.A. the case has been handed over to the Police for investigation. 10/3/34 .. t ^ n &lt;rHerewith the report of Rais Police re the theft in the office.

Nevertheless, I charge Ibrahim,Agency Parrash with this theft and I base this accusation on the fact that he spends a lot of money even much more than his pay which is known how much it is.

Memorandum With reference to the enclosed report regard ing a theft from the servants 1 quarters in the Agency Compound. The matter was reported to me when it took place. I have further examined the police witnesses. It appears that the theft could have taken place sometime during Friday 6th August 1937 or the night of Friday - Saturday up till 11 p.m. The rooms in question is out of sight of the sentry at the Agency gate and there is nothing to prevent any one entering the compound during the day until the west gate is closed at night. I do not find that there is sufficient evidence against any individual to justify further action. The Agency servants when entering the compound at night constantly enter from the shore near the north west gate. H. 15. M’s Folitical iigent, Bahrain. Adviser to the Government. Enclos:THEFT IM AGENCY SERVANTS QUARTER. — 0 OOO 0 — A bisht belonging to P.A T s servant Uasir has been stolen from tne room occupied by Paul's assistant Ahmad bin Abdullah under the circumstances mentioned in the statements submitted herewith. Ahmad was not willing to report the matter to me, although he had reported it to G-uara Gommander. I sent Farrash Bashi to ask him to go to Jasim and give his statement but he refused. I sent another farrash and still he could not be persuaded. Ultimately I had to call him before me and explain to him that there was no harm if he reported. He replied that he did not want any action to be taken and did not want to make any report. I told him that had the theft taken place in his private house we had nothing to do with it; but because it occurred in the Agency compound and we were responsible for its care he had no alternative but to report. He promised before me that he would go to Jasim and give his statement but he hid not. Whe I came to know -ecf it I instructed Jasim to take his statement in any case together with the statements of those who knew anything about it. I have taken no action so far with the exception that I have ordered the Guard Commander to keep the window of the main gate adjoining Post^iaster f s house bolted from inside as formerly the gate used to be closed^at lO.OO.p.m. when P.A. was in Bahrain at at 8.p.m. when P.A. was away* 'The result of my investiagtions will be reported in due course.Statement of Ahmad bin Abdullah, assistant Butler in the Agency ♦ On the day of 6/8/37(Friday)I took leave and dici not come to the Agency.
