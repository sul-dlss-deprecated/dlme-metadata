A cut-out and regulator is either embodied in the dynamo or supplied as a separate unit. DYNAMO CHAIR.—This provides endwise adjustment of the dynamo for the alignment of the belt and facilitates the removal of the dynamo. BATTERY.— This is of the 12-volt acid type. When delivered within the United Kingdom it is filled with acid, charged and sent in a special container, free il returned carriage paid. Batteries for export contain no acid. The capacity of the battery must not exceed the maximum stated on page 1091, or the dynamo will be overloaded. It is possible, however, to increase the battery capacity without increasing the dynamo by fitting two batteries and charging them one at a time. 0k SWITCHBOARD.- Of teak, designed to suit the requirements of the dynamo and to withstand marine conditions. All the connections are made by means of screw terminals on the face of the switchboard. The following are mounted on it: — ammeter, volt meter with switch, main switch and fuse for charging circuit, main switch for lighting circuits ; 3 pairs of lighting terminals each with fuse ; ivorine labels to indicate the connections ; spare fuse wire. SCREENBOARD, page 1088.—A self-contained unit. Of pine, brass screwed. Sides are painted red and green, otherwise varnished. The side lamps are of copper with dioptric glasses, making it possible to use very small bulbs. Oil burners are supplied in reserve. LIGHTS.—Types A, B, and C are weatherproof. A is used for the navigating lights, B for deck illumination, C and D below deck. BULBS.^—These should be of the following capacity:—Compass 3 watts, side lights 6 watts, elsewhere 12 watts. DECK LEAD.—The cable from the masthead light passes through this to a switch fixed below deck. This avoids connections exposed to the weather, and permits the removal of the screenboard without breaking any electrical^® connections—see page 1090. JUNCTION BOX.—The practice of joining one wire to another is unsatisfactory. Every wire should terminate in a screw fitting of some sort. The use of junction boxes is recommended. FUSES.—One of the fuses on the switchboard should be reserved for the navi gating lights, another for the lights above deck, and the third for those below deck. WIRING.—For flexible connections use twin rubber-covered cable. For fixed connections use single lead-covered cable. In existing boats the fore and aft cable may be run along the gunwale. In new boats it is best to sink a brass pipe }- 20 gauge into the deck beams before the deck is laid, as shewn page 1088.

To keep the object within the field is difficult in a rolling boat, and is best accomplished by holding the searchlight in the hands. When not required it should be laid face down on a deck mat as shewn. With the swivel column shewn, it is possible to mount the searchlight on a wheelhouse and direct its movement from below. This form of mounting, however, gives good results only when the vessel is comparatively steady. The consumption is low—4 amps, at 12 volts or 48 watts, yet at a distance of 400 yards, on a clear night, it is possible to read newsprint. The searchlight is perfectly watertight. The body is made of aluminium alloy; the front is of toughened glass and requires no protecting gauze; the swivel column is of brass.

All our models of Yacht W.C.'s illustrated on this and the following pages are fitted with a solid cast pump plunger, and no hemp or other insanitary packing is used. In no case are the plungers fitted with valves passing the soil through the pump. With every flushing stroke, clean water is drawn into the pump, effectually cleansing the interior parts. We employ the same principle for our complete range from the cheapest to the largest and most expensive Models, although the actual design is different. All are fitted with inlet water control which allows the flushing water to be regulated and shut off without causing a vacuum in the pump. The W.G.'s are built of accurately machined interchangeable parts made to limit gauges. All are manufactured by us in our own works. Guaranteed for two years. No. 391. THE ' KENTIGERN ' W.C. For under or above waterline. Developed from our original ' Kentigern ' first produced in 1910. The pump is larger, the soil passages are nowhere less than 2' diameter, and the discharge pipe also is increased to 2' diameter. The automatic inlet water supply is controlled by a self-closing foot pedal. The inlet valve chest, of our own design, prevents any possibility of flooding through the inlet when shut. The action of closing the supply valve opens another valve which allows air to be drawn from the basin to the upper side of the pump. This prevents a vacuum being formed on the back of the pump and makes for ease of operation. The vertical handle is pivotted on a solid pedestal which gives proper support. The result is a W.C. ich is extremely easy to operate notwithstanding the extraordinarily powerful flush, x^ue to the care taken in the design and workmanship, the whole fitting works smoothly and quietly. Can be fitted with discharge for \\' seacock, if required. Specification. All metal parts gunmetal. Discharge valves fitted with renewable vulcanized rubber faces and hinged in a special manner to reduce the possibility of jamming by matches, etc. Pump cylinder 3J' diameter, turned and reamered to an accurate fit. Solid gunmetal piston. Inlet valve chest gunmetal throughout, with brass valves, rubber faced, operated by a foot pedal lever having a spring return action housed in a grease-fitted tube. All small metal parts turned from solid bronze bar. Handle link parts accurately machined and fitted in reamered holes. Oval basin of fine glazed earthenware. No leather anywhere. Arranged for lead pipes. If fitted for copper pipes, see page 53. Finish. All polished metal parts chromium plated, other metal parts white Ardak finish.

For untrer or above wafterline^ We clahK^this to be the most modern design of any hand-operated W.C. yet produced. All valves^^H pipes, etc., are incorporated in the base casting. The c&gt;rfly exposed parts are the ba^iu^pump casing and the operating handle. The pump c^mg is polished stainless steel with nbsmojections of any sort to gather dirt; the u^tfal stuffing gland, links, etc., being concealefckm an extension of the pump casting Briefly, arrangement is as mtt^ws : The single pump operates^both water supply and discharge. The inlet water is drawiv^nto the upper side of the^nnnp by means of a passage S st in the pump itself, through a va^^chest controlleci^by a foot pedal. From the pump travels back through the same passag^S^a anotiief valve in the inlet chest through a pipe cast in the bedplate and up a passage mNjM€cl in the basin to the flushing rim. The discharge is taken past a first valve, thrmxgha^N^annel cast in the base, to the pump ; thence through another valve to an outlet nipple aS^he back. Any obstruction can be cleared in a few minutes ; a singl^eover plate held by^screws being removed to expose all valves and passages on Jtxrfh inlet and discharge sterns. The W.C. is suitable for theTargest vessels, being fitted with pov^^ful pump of 5' diameter, the inlet pipes beineT^' diameter and the discharge passagesSmvhere less than 2£' diameter. The inlet valve is foot operated, self-closing, and designed th^revent a vacuum forming in thepthnp while in the closed position. Specification^Solid gunmetal base plate with passages cast integral.

A model for small craft which embodies all the sanitary features of our larger and more expensive models. • ^Ilie pump is 3' diameter and the valves are hinged in an improved manner which reduces the possibility of jamming with matches, etc. All small parts are made on automatic machinery, which in addition to ensuring accuracy of workmanship, enables us to market the W.C. at a price not hitherto possible. All parts made to limit gauges. The pump is double acting, and the flushing water is controllable through a special inlet valve which, when closed, automatically prevents a vacuum forming in the pump. This makes for easy working.

A cut-out and regulator is either embodied in the dynamo or supplied as a separate unit. DYNAMO CHAIR.—This provides endwise adjustment of the dynamo for the alignment of the belt and facilitates the removal of the dynamo. BATTERY.— This is of the 12-volt acid type. When delivered within the United Kingdom it is filled with acid, charged and sent in a special container, free if returned carriage paid. Batteries for export contain no acid. The capacity of the battery must not exceed the maximum stated on page 1091, or the dynamo will be overloaded. It is possible, however, to increase the battery capacity without increasing the dynamo by fitting two batteries and charging them one at a time. SWITCHBOARD.—Of teak, designed to suit the requirements of the dynamo an^ to withstand marine conditions. All the connections are made by means l screw terminals on the face of the switchboard. The following are mounted on it: — ammeter volt meter with switch, main switch and fuse for charging circuit, main switch for lighting circuits ; 3 pairs of lighting terminals each with fuse ; ivorine labels to indicate the connections ; spare fuse wire. SCREENBOARD, page 1088.—A self-contained unit. Of pine, brass screwed. Sides are painted red and green, otherwise varnished. The side lamps are of copper with dioptric glasses, making it possible to use very small bulbs. Oil burners are supplied in reserve. LIGHTS.—Types A, B, and C are weatherproof. A is used for the navigating lights, B for deck illumination, C and D below deck. BULBS.- These should be of the following capacity:—Compass 3 watts, side lights 6 watts, elsewhere 12 watts. DECK LEAD.— The cable from the masthead light passes through this to a switch fixed below deck. This avoids connections exposed to the weather, and permits the removal of the screenboard without breaking any electrical connections -see page 1090. . JUNCTION BOX.—The practice of joining one wire to another is unsatisfactory. Every wire should terminate in a screw fitting of some sort. The use of junction boxes is recommended. FUSES.—One of the fuses on the switchboard should be reserved for the navi gating lights, another for the lights above deck, and the third for those below deck. WIRING.—For flexible connections use twin rubber-covered cable. For fixed connections use single lead-covered cable. In existing boats the fore and aft cable may be run along the gunwale. In new boats it is best to sink a brass pipe |—20 gauge into the deck beams before the deck is laid, as shewn page 1088. This makes a neat job, saves time and facilitates repairs.lo.so V 7 JUNCTION BOX DYNAMO CHAIR DYNAMO dynamo,mounted on CHAIR, may be arranged on hull as shown at A , or on bulkhead as at B , OR on underside of de.cx as at c.

To keep the object within the field is difficult in a rolling boat, and is best accomplished by holding the searchlight in the hands. When not required it should be laid face down on a deck mat as shewn. With the swivel column shewn, it is possible to mount the searchlight on a wheelhouse and direct its movement from below. This form of mounting, however, gives good results only when the vessel is comparatively steady. The consumption is low—4 amps, at 12 volts or 48 watts, yet at a distance of 400 yards, on a clear night, it is possible to read newsprint. The searchlight is perfectly watertight. The body is made of aluminium alloy; the front is of toughened glass and requires no protecting gauze; the swivel column is of brass.

CODE Y I Grid Steering Compasses Steering by Parallelism There is a growing tendency amongst owners of motor craft to use 'Parallelism' or the 'Grid' method of steering, and for those unfamiliar with the ' 'parallel'' compass the following notes will be useful. The compass bowl (A) is the same as used for an ordinary liquid compass. The magnet system supports eight radial damping wires (B), spaced 45 degrees apart. A small compass card (C), marked in points and degrees (0—360 degrees) is fixed on the wires. The wire running parallel to the magnets (D) is painted red. The lubber line (E) runs across the diameter of the compass underneath the window in the fore and aft position. To steer a given course, clamp the grid ring so that the required course is registered by the lubber line. Then turn the craft until the red 'N ' and 'S ' wires are parallel to the grid wires and the former points to ' 'N' 1 on the grid ring. The vessel will then be heading in the desired direction, and the course is steered, not by keeping a required degree against the lubber line, but simply by keeping the grid wires parallel. The compass is simple to use, and is generally considered very satisfactory. Its design allows it to be mounted (within reasonable limits) in positions other than directly in front of the helmsman without the effect of parallax becoming serious. Solent The ' 'Solent'' is designed for motor yachts, and the steering is arranged by the 1 'grid'' system which is fully explained above.

The skill and resource that produced the famous ' All World Four ' and '* Kilodyne ' Receivers, plus a rapid technical advance during an Unavoidable Interlude, has since been concentrated on marketing this fine Receiver. It is a set that will be admired by all listeners who appreciate a well-engineered and reliable job. The ' 556 ' is sturdy and efficient, designed for first-class results and long reliable service under adverse climatic conditions. Materials and components throughout are fully tropicalised and the set is of very robust construction. It gives good loudspeaker reception of the World's principal short wave and medium-wave radio stations. There is no complicated tuning. The dial is clearly calibrated and a beautifully constructed slow-motion driving mechanism ensures delightful tuning and freedom from backlash. The other controls are a combined 'on—off' switch and tone control ; a waveband switch and a simple volume control. The electrical and mechanical system incorporates the latest short-wave technique and constructional features which ensure that the set will perform its function in a reliable and efficient manner with a minimum of attention. Excellent long-distance reception and good quality reproduction can easily be attained by quite inexperienced users after a few moments of instruction.Technical Specification CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT. The basic circuit of the ' 556 ' is an 8-valve super heterodyne using two radio frequency stages followed by a frequency changer, two intermediate frequency stages, a combined A.V.C. detector and first audio amplifier, noise limiter and an output valve. There is also the rectifier and an electron beam tuning indicator. All valves have International octal bases. TUNING RANGE. The receiver will tune continuously from 10 metres to 500 metres (30,000 Kc/s. to 600 Kc/s.) in five over lapping bands. Coil changing is unnecessary, each range being switched as required by a wave-band control on the front panel. The range in use is shown by an in dicator on the dial. TUNING MECHANISM. A single control tuning with special vernier indicator enables easy adjustment and setting of the calibrated scale. The tuning mechanism is an excellent piece of equipment, beautifully made and permitting smooth and rapid operation. It is free from backlash and is noiseless mechanically and electrically. The gearing reduction ratio is 140-1 and the effective scale length of the tuning dial is 36 inches. DIAL CALIBRATION. Four of the five wave-bands are calibrated in megacycles and the fifth in kilocycles. A subsidary pointer working off the main tuning mechanism ensures accurate dial setting and simplifies the logging of stations when accurate tuning is necessary in a particularly congested wave-band. The dial is of satin finish with black numbers and is easy to follow without eyestrain. INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY STAGE. The intermediate frequency is 450 kc/s., using permeability-tuned transformers. Careful design and construction has ensured that the I.F. stages maintain their set frequency and eliminates any tendency to drift, due to climatic changes. SENSITIVITY. Sensitivity is better than 2 microvolts input on the high-frequency range for an output of 50 milliwatts. Comparative results are obtained with aerials whose characteristics differ widely. SELECTIVITY. 30 db. down at 5 kc/s. off Resonance. SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO. Great care has been taken to ensure that a really good signal to noise ratio is maintained. IMAGE RATIOS. At 20 Mc/s. the image ratio is 35 db. down. » 10 .. 50 „ » 5 60 .. 2 „ 75 RESPONSE. Twin-matched loudspeakers of excellent accoustical balance and high-tonal qualities are fitted internally. Provision is made for an extension speaker to be connected. The overall response has been adjusted to cover audio frequencies required for a good standard of speech and music, and to attenuate those frequencies which tend to bring in noise. • CONSTRUCTION AND FINISH. The panel assembly, chassis and components are fully tropicalised. No cardboard-cased condensers are used. All paper di-electric and electrolytic condensers are fitted in specially sealed metal cases for additional pro tection. The die-cast panel and chassis assembly ensures extreme rigidity of construction which enhances stability and is an important feature in a set that will be shipped abroad and travel long distances over bad roads in tropical countries. The whole assembly cannot warp or rot and is fully insect proof. Protruding metal handles afford protection to the receiver panel and controls during packing and transit. The Receiver is pleasingly finished in battleship grey and has an attractive blue front panel. All fittings are chromium plated and the complete set presents a neat, workmanlike and unobtrusive appearance. • GRAMOPHONE PICK-UP ATTACHMENT. At the rear of the receiver connections are provided to allow the use of a gramophone pick-up and the audio amplifier stages give excellent musical reproduction. • OUTPUT. The audio frequency output of the Receiver is at least 3,000 milli-watts. • EXTENSION SPEAKER OUTPUT. This is arranged to match into an external extension speaker with an impedance of 2.5 ohms. • ACCESSIBILITY. The panel and chassis are easily withdrawn from the cabinet by removing 4 fixing screws. The Receiver assembly is then accessible for inspection and servicing. • I NPUT IMPEDANCE at Aerial Terminal 400 ohms. • DIAL ILLUMI NATION. The dial scale is illuminated by three 6-volt 1.8 watt, lamps with bayonet fitting. The indirect lighting on the satin-finished scale gives adequate illumination without glare. • DIMENSIONS. Overall Width, 16,' inches ; Depth, 10{ inches ; Height, 9 inches. • WEIGHT. Unpacked : 40 lbs. • PACKING. The Receiver is initially packed in a stout well-designed cardboard carton and then outer-packed for rail or shipment in a standard timber crate. Every care is taken to see that the possibility of damage in transit is reduced to an absolute minimum. • POWER SUPPLIES. Four Models of this Receiver are available. Cat. No. 556/A.C. for 110 volt and 200/240 volt, 40/60 cycles A.C. input. Cat. No. 556/B. for 6 volt accumulator input Cat. No. 556/D.C.110 for 110 volt D.C. input. Cat. No. 556/D.C.220 for 220 volt D.C. input. Models 556/D.C.110 and 556/D.C.220 use a standard A.C. Receiver operated from a rotary converter which trans forms D.C. to A.C. Separate converters are needed to work from 110 volt or 220 volt D.C. input. It is import ant, therefore, to state input voltage when ordering for D.C. Mains. • ACCESSORIES. Cat. No. 556/VAL : Set of spare valves. Cat. No. 556/AER ; Set of aerial/earth equipment compris ing wire, insulators, lead-in, pulley, halyard and earth tube.All 'EDDYSTONE ' Receivers are Well Designed, Robustly Constructed, Fully Tropicalised and give Reliable, Outstanding Performance.

Dear Sir, vVith reference to your letter, we have taken the cuestion of the suitability of our small portable wireless set up with the manufacturers and they reply as follows f, //e are of the opinion that the portable model we manufacture for you would be unsuitable for your Client T s purpose, particularly as it would not be possible for us to include i:he short wave band 13/49 metres, whicl^ we think is an essential requirement for a Receiver which is to be used in the Persian Guif. 'The most suitable Receiver would be 'a small table model all-wave battery instrument where means are provided for the attachment of an outside aerial.' We think ho./ever, that the set of which we are enclosingyou particulars herewith, would be eminently suitable for your purpose. It is the Eddy stone ''556 1; Receiver and is for export only. The list price is £40. 9- 6. and a recommended Battery can be supplied, if required at £8. 12. 6. The current consumption of the Receiver is 6.5 amperes, and the capacity of the Battery we supply is approximately 110 ampere hours. Trusting to receive your esteemed order which shall receive our immediate attention, We remain, p.S, ..e tre eixlosing Browne's Catslogue of CompEsses, end if you would let uo knov. which uodel interests you, 1 '■ will endoevour to get this kiid quote you price end delivery.

')art of the compass catalogue which we think v.'i 1 1 interest you.!• The wireless is very expensive, and I am not disposed to order it at present. 2. As regards the compass which is badly needed for the launch I have consulted the Navigation Officer of H-M.3. 'Wildgoose'. The point was made to me before that the compass card should be at least 6' in diameter it in order to make/visible at all times to local eyes. I think, this is most desirable. The Navigation Officer and I came to the conclusion that No.3885 in the 'Sestrel' catalogue,'code mark AEOZE', would be the most suitable. It is about £10/- cheaper than the corresponding 'Viking' model. It is, however, a pretty large instrument, and weighs, it should be noted, 64 lbs. After a look at the wheel-house of the launch, the Navigation Officer confirmed my impression that it would be too small for this compass. The alternatives are therefore: (a) to build a larger wheel-house. (b) to buy a smaller compass. The Navigation Officer said he would send me details of what a good' compass should contain. 9.7.'47.I i i BEDFORD COMMERCIAL VEHIC LES DISTRIBUTORS Telephone : Preston 3203 (three lines) E.R.F.

In addition to any liberties expressed or implied in this Bill of leading, the Carrier shall have the liberty to comply with any orders or directions as to departure, arrival, routes, ports of call, stoppages, transhipment, discharge or destination or otherwise, howsoever given by any Government or any Department thereof or of any person acting or purporting to act with the authority of any Government or any Department thereof, or by any War Risk Insurance Association working under any Government scheme in which the vessel may be entered, and nothing done or not done under such orders or directions shall be deemed a deviation. 7. Every piece or package must lie distinctly, correctly and permanently marked by the Shipper before shipment with a mark and number or address and with the name of the port of discharge in letters not less than two inches long, and the Carrier will not l)e responsible for consequences of failure to comply with these requirements. In case any damage or loss results to the Carrier, vessel, cargo, lighters, or to any life or property owing to no weight, or incorrect weight, having been declared by the Shipper, or owing to incorrect^ or insufficient marking or description of the pieces or packages, or owing to pieces or packag not being in accordance with local requirements at port of discharge, the Owner of the goods sha. be responsible therefor. The Owner of the goods shall bear and pay the cost of all mending, baling, cooperage and repairs to packages, boxes, crates, wrappers, bags, barrels or other cases or coverings resulting from insufficiency of packing or from excepted perils. Neither the Carrier nor the vessel shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with goods in an amount exceeding £100 per package or unit or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the Shipper before shipment and inserted in the Bill of fading. The value shall be the net invoice cost and disbursements. 8. The freight payable as above has been calculated and based upon a description of the goods declared by the Shippers to the Carrier. The Carrier shall be entitled to re-weigh or re- measure any goods, and freight shall be paid on the excess weight or measurement (if any) so ascertained. The expense incident to re-weighing or re-measuring shall lie borne by the Carrier if the weights or measurements as furnished by the Shipper are found to be correct, but other wise such expenses shall be borne and paid by the Owner of the goods. If the description or (in cases where the value has been stated) the value of the goods has been misstated by the Shipper, double the amount of such freight shall be paid by the Owner of the goods as would have been charged if the goods had been accurately described and valued, and a certificate signed by the Carrier or his Agent shall be conclusive evidence of the amount that would have been so charged. 9. Delivery of the goods shall be taken from the vessel's own tackle by the rail or when vessel's tackle not used then over the rail by the Consignees or their agents (including the Harbour Board or other port authority or their agents, where it is customary for them to receive the goods) from the vessel's tackle immediately upon discharge, otherwise at the option of the Carrier the goods may be stored afloat or ashore at the expense (including sorting and/or stacking) and risk of the Owner of the goods, but subject to Carrier's lien. The Carrier shall be at liberty to discharge day and night, Sundays and holidays included, as fast as the vessel can deliver, and shall be under no liability to notify the Owner of the goods of the arrival of the goods ; any custom of the port to the contrary notwithstanding. Any loss or expense caused owing to Customs, Consular or other regulations not being complied with, or to Customs permit and/or other necessary papers not being lodged within twenty-four hours after the vessel's entry at the Customs, will be charged to the Owner of the goods, who shall indemnify the Carrier, and the Carrier shall be at liberty to return the goods to the port of shipment or to land them at any other port at the sole risk and expense of the Owner of the goods, charging in either case the freight and/or forwarding expenses thereon to the Owner of the goods. 10. The Carrier shall not be responsible for loss, damage or delay arising trom or consequent upon quarantine regulations whatsoever or wheresoever arising, and in the event of quarantine the goods may be discharged into any depot, hulk, or sanitary or other vessel as required for the vessel's despatch, and all expenses of complying with such regulations as regards the goods comprised in this Bill of leading, aud all other quarantine expenses on the goods of whatsoever nature or kind shall be borne by the Owner of the goods. 11. The Carrier shall have a lien over the goods, and the right to sell the same by public auction or otherwise for all freight, primage and charges (including additional freight or double freight and/or expenses under Clause 8 payable on corrected weight or measurement) and for all payments made and liabilities incurred in respect of charges, expenditure, damages, costs and expenses (including the costs and expenses of exercising such lien and of such sale) and for the interest (if any) payable thereon which under this Bill of leading are to be borne and paid by the Owner of the goods. 12. General Average shall be adjusted according to York/Antwerp Rules, 1924. Adjustments shall be prepared at port selected by the Carrier. Such deposit as the Carrier or his Agents may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the goods and any special charges thereon shall, if required, be paid to the Carrier or his agents previously to delivery. Should salvage services be rendered to the cargo by any other vessel or vessels belonging wholly or in part to or chartered by the same ownership or Line, such salvage services shall be paid for as fully as if they had been rendered by a vessel or vessels entirely the property of different ownerships or Lines. 13. The contract evidenced by this Bill of Lading shall be governed by the law of England. 14. If the Shipowners shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and properl y manned, equipped and supplied, then if the vessel comes into collision with another vessel as a result of iiegligent navigation of both vessels, the Owners of the cargo carried hereunder will indemnify the Shipowner against all liability to the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners in so far as such liability represents loss or damage to or any claim whatsoever of said cargo paid or payable by the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners to the said cargo Owners and set off, recouped or recovered by the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners as part of their claim against the carrying vessel or Shipowner. 4, and the Schedule thereto are to apply to the sf Lading, and the Carrier is to be entitled to the xmtained in such Act and the Schedule thereto anything herein contained be inconsistent with ccasion of such inconsistency and no further, be latsoever for loss of or damage to goods howsoever »e arises prior to the loading on and/or subsequent in this Bill of Lading, have the benefit of all ned in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, England, isengers and/or cargo from one or more ports in e to one or more ports in the Persian Gulf via ts in the Mediterranean (including Adriatic and ts in the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman, and it such ports in geographical or any specified i of loading and/or discharging passengers and/or docking with or without the cargo on board, for asses or otherwise for any purpose whatsoever or lading, to proceed to and stay at any ports •ntinent between Hamburg and Bordeaux both id to return to any such port or ports to delay te and to change the proposed route before the /oyage or to put into and remain at any port for oceed to any ports or places in the Mediterranean, its rivers and inlets, in any order backwards or charge and all or any of such routes or ports or i though not in geographical sequence or strictly ed to be within the intended voyage, towed, or tow, and assist vessels in all situations, tie, deck house, shelter deck, or any other covered- riage of goods, and such goods shall be deemed •pt, loaded, carried and discharged at Shipper's reof or damage thereto.

The carrier shall, notwithstanding anything in this Bill of Lading, have the benefit of all exemptions from and limitations of liability contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, England, and any existing modifications thereof. 2. The vessels of the Line proceed with passengers and/or cargo from one or more ports in the United Kingdom and/or Continent of Europe to one or more ports in the Persian Gulf via intermediate ports for example among others ports in the Mediterranean (including Adriatic and Aegean Seas and East of the Suez Canal), ports in the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman, and it is not always practicable to proceed between such ports in geographical or any specified sequence. The vessel has liberty for the purposes of loading and/or discharging passengers and/or cargo of all kinds dangerous or otherwise, for dry docking with or without the cargo on board, for bunkering or storing, repairing, adjusting compasses or otherwise for any purpose whatsoever of the Line or of the vessel, her crew, passengers or lading, to proceed to and stay at any ports or places in the United Kingdom and/or the Continent between Hamburg and Bordeaux both inclusive in any order backwards or forwards and to return to any such port or ports to delay the sailing from any port to proceed by any route and to change the proposed route before the commencement of or at any time or stage of the voyage or to put into and remain at any port for the above purposes aud for the same purposes to proceed to any ports or places in the Mediterranean, as described above, also in the Persian Gulf and its rivers and inlets, in any order backwards or forwards and even though beyond the port of discharge and all or any of such routes or ports or places whether of loading, call or discharging even though not in geographical sequence or strictly within the customary or advertised route are agreed to be within the intended voyage. The vessel may sail with or without pilots, be towed, or tow, and assist vessels in all situations. 3. The goods may be stowed in poop, forecastle, deck house, shelter deck, or any other covered- in space commonly used in the trade for the carriage of goods, and such goods shall be deemed for all purposes to be stowed under deck. Cargo on deck and livestock are received, kept, loaded, carried and discharged at Shipper's risk and the Carrier shall not be liable for loss thereof or damage thereto. The Carrier shall have all the same liberties rights and immunities as are available to him for cargo under deck. The vessel is free to carry livestock, goods of all kinds, dangerous or otherwise, contraband, explosives, munitions or warlike stores, and may sail armed or unarmed. 4. The Carrier shall have liberty to carry the goods to or from the vessel in lighters, vessels or other craft, the goods being at the sole risk of the Owner of the goods. Such lighterage in loading or discharging shall be payable by the Owner of the goods unless otherwise arranged. The Carrier shall have liberty to discharge and tranship or land and/or store (either ashore or afloat) the goods at any ports at which the vessel calls, and forward or return them by land and/or water by any route to the port of destination at his own expense but in all respects at the risk of the Owner of the goods. On discharge from the vessel above-named at such port of tranship ment or of discharge, the Carrier's responsibility shall cease, nor shall he nor the vessel be under any circumstances liable for any loss or detention of or damage to the goods occurring after such discharge, or while the goods are not in the actual custody of the Carrier or of his servants. In respect of the carriage of goods from such port of transhipment or of discharge to the port of destina tion, and of the storage, transport and transhipment of the goods while not on board a vessel of the Line, the Carrier acts as forwarding agent only, paying the expenses of such operations but incurring no responsibility as carrier or custodian of the goods, or otherwise for any loss, damage or detention, howsoever caused ; in respect of such carriage, the goods shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the conveyance beyond the port of discharge, and the Owner of the goods will have the benefit of the obligations of any such carriers by land or by water or of any warehouse man, lighterman or others under their respective contracts with the Line. If, owing to strikes, lock-outs or lat&gt;our disturbances at port of transhipment or at port of destination, or to any Cause beyond the control of the agents of the Line, the goods shall be delayed at the port of transhipment beyond the period which would elapse before transhipment in normal circumstances, the storage and other charges upon the goods after the expiration of the normal period shall be borne by the owner of the goods. 5. In case of disturbances, congestion, shortage of craft or lack of discharging facilities at the port of discharge, and/or in case of the blockade or interdict of such port or final destination of the goods shipped hereunder, or if the entering of or discharging in such port shall be prohibited or prevented or likely to be delayed through any of the causes mentioned or by blockade interdict quarantine, strikes, lock-outs, labour troubles (whether the Carrier or his servants are parties thereto or not), civil commotions riot war epidemic fever or other illness, or any other cause whatsoever beyond the Carrier's control, or if it shall be considered by the Master unsafe or inadvisable for any of the said reasons or otherwise, or it is likely to subject the vessel or the goods to quarantine there or at any subsequent port, then the goods may be landed or put into lighters there or at the nearest safe and convenient port or place at the expense and risk of the Owner of the goods ; and the Carrier's responsibility shall cease when the goods are so discharged into proper and safe keeping, the Master or Agents giving immediate notice of the same to the Consignees of the goods so far as they are known, or by public advertisement. Such discharge shall constitute due delivery of the goods under this Bill of Lading, and the owner of the goods shall bear and pay all charges and expenses incurred in consequence of such discharge. 6. When and so long as a state of war exists and/or so long as any control over the use or movements of the vessels is exercised by any Governmental or other Authorities, aud/or the insulated or other space on this vessel is requisitioned or controlled by any of His Majesty's Governments, the Carrier and/or his Agent and /or the Master may (if in their uncontrolled discretion IN WITNESS whereof the Master, Purser or Agent of the said Vessel hath affirmed accomplished, the others to stand void. If required by the Carrier or his Agent, one of the Bil' they think it advisable) at any time before or after the commencement of the voyage alter or vary or depart from the proposed or advertised or agreed or customary route, and/or delay or detain the vessel at or off any port and/or tranship the cargo at any port or ports without being liable for loss or damage directly or indirectly sustained. In addition to any liberties expressed or implied in this Bill of Lading, the Carrier shall have the liberty to complv with any orders or directions as to departure, arrival, routes, ports of call, stoppages, transhipment, discharge or destination or otherwise, howsoever given by any Government or any Department thereof or of any person acting or purporting to act with the authority of any Government or any Department thereof, or by any War Risk Insurance Association working uuder any Government scheme in which the vessel may be entered, and nothing done or not done under such orders or direcUons shall be deemed a deviation. 7. Every piece or package must be distinctly, correctly and permanently marked by the Shipper before shipment with a mark and number or address and with the name of the port of discharge in letters not less than two inches long, and the Carrier will not be responsible for consequences of failure to comply with these requirements. In case any damage or loss results to the Carrier, vessel, cargo, lighters, or to any life or property owing to no weight, or incorrect weight, having been declared by the Shipper, or owing to incorrect or insufficient marking or description of the pieces or packages, or owing to pieces or packag not being in accordance with local requirements at port of discharge, the Owner of the goods shai. be responsible therefor. The Owner of the goods shall bear and pay the cost of all mending, baling, cooperage and repairs to packages, boxes, crates, wrappers, bags, barrels or other cases or coverings resulting from insufficiency of packing or from excepted perils. Neither the Carrier nor the vessel shall iu any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with goods in an amount exceeding £100 per package or unit or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the Shipper before shipment and inserted in the Bill of Lading. The value shall be the net invoice cost and disbursements. 8. The freight payable as above has been calculated and based upon a description of the goods declared by the Shippers to the Carrier. The Carrier shall be entitled to re-weigh or re- measure any goods, and freight shall be paid on the excess weight or measurement (if any) so ascertained. The expense incident to re-weighing or re-measuring shall be borne by the Carrier if the weights or measurements as furnished by the Shipper are found to be correct, but other wise such expenses shall be borne and paid by the Owner of the goods. If the description or (in cases where the value has been stated) the value of the goods has been misstated by the Shipper, double the amount of such freight shall be paid by the Owner of the goods as would have beeti charged if the goods had been accurately described and valued, and a certificate signed by the Carrier or his Agent shall be conclusive evidence of the amount that would have been so charged 9. Delivery of the goods shall be taken from the vessel's own tackle by the rail or when vessel's tackle not used then over the rail by the Consignees or their agents (including the Harbour Board or other port authority or their agents, where it is customary for them to receive the goods) from the vessel's tackle immediately upon discharge, otherwise at the option of the Carrier the goods may be stored afloat or ashore at the expense (including sorting and/or stacking) and risk of the Owner of the goods, but subject to Carrier's lien. The Carrier shall be at liberty to discharge day and night, Sundays and holidays included, as fast as the vessel can deliver, and shall be under no liability to notify the Owner of the goods of the arrival of the goods ; any custom of the port to the contrary notwithstanding. Any loss or expense caused owing to Customs, Consular or other regulations not being complied with, or to Customs permit and/or other necessary papers not being lodged within twenty-four hours after the vessel's entry at the Customs, will be charged to the Owner of the goods, who shall indemnify the Carrier, and the Carrier shall be at liberty to return the goods to the port of shipment or to land them at any other port at the sole risk and expense of the Owner of the goods, charging in cither case the freight and/or forwarding expenses thereon to the Owner of the goods. 10. The Carrier shall not be responsible for loss, damage or delay arising irom or consequent upon quarantine regulations whatsoever or wheresoever arising, and in the event of quarantine the goods may be discharged into any depot, hulk, or sanitary or other vessel as required for the vessel's despatch, and all expenses of complying with such regulations as regards the goods comprised in this Bill of Lading, and all other quarantine expenses on the goods of whatsoever nature or kind shall be borne by the Owner of the goods. 11. The Carrier shall have a lien over the goods, and the right to sell the same by public auction or otherwise for all freight, primage and charges (including additional freight or double freight and/or expenses under Clause 8 payable on corrected weight or measurement) and for all payments made and liabilities incurred in respect of charges, expenditure, damages, costs and expenses (including the costs and expenses of exercising such lien and of such sale) and for the interest (if any) payable thereon which under this Bill of Lading are to be borne and paid by the Owner of the goods. 12. General Average shall be adjusted according to York/Antwerp Rules, 1924. Adjustments shall be prepared at port selected by the Carrier. Such deposit as the Carrier or his Agents may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the goods and any special charges thereon shall, if required, be paid to the Carrier or his agents previously to delivery. Should salvage services be rendered to the cargo by any other vessel or vessels belonging wholly or in part to or chartered by the same ownership or Line, such salvage services shall be paid for as fully as if they had been rendered by a vessel or vessels entirely the property of different ownerships or Lines. 13. The contract evidenced by this Bill of Lading shall be governed by the law of England. 14. If the Shipowners shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and properl y manned, equipped and supplied, then if the vessel comes into collision with another vessel as a result of negligent navigation of both vessels, the Owners of the cargo carried hereunder will indemnify the Shipowner against all liability to the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners in so far as such liability represents loss or damage to or any claim whatsoever of said cargo paid or payable by the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners to the said cargo Owners and set off, recouped or recovered by the other or non-carrying vessel or her Owners as part of their claim against the carrying vessel or Shipowner. •T» tf Q Bills of Lading, all of this tenor and date, one of which bein^ Ire oreading must be given up, fully endorsed iu exchange for the goods.

We are sorry but only the Type NH10 lamp is available, production of the NH5 having been discontinued 2 in order to concentrate all available lamp production W facilities on one type only, for obvious reasons at the present time. The NH10 larap is designed for portable use only, and we do not think that the concentrated beam of light which it provides, together with the fact that the bulb is of 2 watts capacity only, would be suitable for the purpose in view,. We are sorry but we have nothing to offer in the way of roof fixtures which will provide downward lighting. In our opinion, for a satisfactory lighting system you need a central battery of not less than say 24 volts with properly installed wiring and fitments. However, we are very pleased to supply handlamps in accordance with your order. The present day price per IT^IO is 65/- (Sixty five shillings^ with delivery to your address by post, 5/- CPive shillings) extra including insurance. In view of the fact that only the NH10 is VvarLLabl. 6 * would you like two of these or just one.

With regard to the 24 volt battery which you contemplate for lighting the launch we would suggest a 2U- volt WIFE battery having a capacity of 25 ampere hours would be suitable, and we have pleasure in attaching hereto our quotation. Should you decide to order this latter battery, it will, of course, be shipped as freight in the usual way and the necessary .amount of electrolyte will, of course, accompany it in dry flake form. We might*, therefore, mention at this stage th at the electrolyte used for thft batter^s is precisely the same **quired for the lamps, so that we could, if you wished, ^^roare ^moun+ of electrolyte which could be used for your .napjXwith this battery if you so desire it.

We have pleasure in enclosing herewith catalogues of the 9ft. general purpose and sailing dinghies, from which you will note the prices are £46.10. 0 and £69.16. 0 respectively. The crating, freight, insurance and all charges through to Bahrain would be an additional £33* 2. 6. This figure is the same for either the 9ft. general purpose or sailing- dinghy. With regard to the davits, we are going into this matter and will write you further in a few days. We think we should be able to supply suitable ones, and if they were sent with the boat we do not anticipate there would be any increase in the freight charges, as they would probably be packed in the same crate. We feel that these craft are particularly suitable for the extreme heat of your climate, as being made of metal, they are less liable to warp and are not subject to pest. They can be stored on dry land and refloated without any risk of leaks owing to the seams opening. There are only three main seams down the length of the boat, all of which are very carefully riveted and sealed with a form of filling which never completely hardens and is always pliable and soft. Trusting the catalogues give you the full particulars you require, We are, Yours faithfully, EUSTACE wATKIn'S i^lMxTED F.S. With regard to davits, it would help if you could give us some idea of the size of your boat. We imagine the boat is Fhilip Watkins. constructed of W00d U .

LIGHTCRAFT 5 seater dinghy is achieved by specialised longitudinal and lateral bracing to withstand hard treatment. Metal construction withstands heat, the boat can be stored on dry land without the risk of warping or leaks. SAFETY. A buoyancy tank is fitted to prevent sinking even if capsized— it is therefore safe for children. A really seaworthy boat that handles well. Ideal for fishing, shooting, camping, bathing—all forms of water sport. i3 LIGHTNESS. Weighs only V lb. complete, made possible by the aircraft method of construction and the use of non-corrosive aluminium alloy utilised by lifeboats, flying boats and many naval craft throughout the war.cJOtgLt — Ql^eiglis on It; M //&gt;. UTILITY. Its extreme lightness enables two people to lift it easily on to the adjustable car roof fittings. In place the dinghy in no way affects driving. Vision is unobscured. The removable fittings leave no mark on the car and they can also be used as a luggage grid. Fitting time 2 minutes. No maintenance, the alloy itself resists corrosion of salt water, no varnishing, caulking, etc. Weighs 45% less than boats of similar size. The owner of E. W. LIGHTCRAFT can enjoy boating in all its forms at a moment's notice. Unlike wood there is no 'shrinkage,' no seams to close. Straight from the garage to the sea without preparation.

Dear Leigh, I enclose a very rough and,I am afraid, very dirty sketch of the Agency launch not to scale but the longitudinal meesurements are fairly exact, and you will see my idea as to how below-deck accommodation should be arranged if the engine were moved to the rear compartment. The trouble is that the space enclosed in blue pencil in the middle of the ship gives, as you will see, less than 6* head room while I consider that not less than 6' 6 M head room is the minimum for comfort, 2. I am taking you at your word that you will be willing to undertake to move the engine aft and consequent re-fitting. This would Involve raising the deck over the blue pencil enclosed space by a foot which I imagine would be a pretty big Job, 3, If you will confirm that you are prepared to under take the work, we might have a further consultation about it. Yours sincerely, D' Group Captain H,P,G, Leigh, State Engineer, Bahrain,/ 1946 Britannia and Mariner Engines OUTBOARD AND INBOARD 12-CYL. TWO-STROKE MOTORS DEVELOPING 4 HP. Britannia Outboard FOR many years before the war the Britannia outboard engines were well known to both British and overseas yachtsmen. Messrs. British Motor Boat Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Britannia House, Ampton Street, Lon don, W.C.i, have recently announced their post-war programme, which con sists of a 4 h.p. outboard known as the Britannia and an inboard motor of the same power called the Mariner, fitted with a reduction gear. During the war this outboard was put to a variety of uses, and with a silencer, specially developed to ensure quiet running it was used by the Com mandos. Both engines are two-strokes with horizontally opposed twin cylinders of 50.5 mm bore and stroke of 41 mm, giving a total capacfty\Qf 165 c.c. The output is 4 b.h.p. at 3 ,o5tvr.p .m. The new outboard has be&gt;u cleaned up in appearance by the additioh^f a -called streamline tank through whicK^ protrudes the flywheel magneto to which is fitted the starting pulley. The crankshaft is of nitralloy steel and em bodies a rotary valve which controls the distribution of mixture to the cylinders. The makers claim that this feature also tends to easy starting, even slow running, economy in fuel consump tion, as well as removing the tempera mental behaviour which seems to afflict the average two-stroke engine. Lubri cation, as in most two-strokes, is by means of the petroil system. The drive shaft is of stainless steel turning a three-bladed propeller of g^in diameter and Sin pitch through bevel gearing. Water is prevented from en tering and grease from escaping from the gear box by the use of double seals. The conventional cooling pump has been eliminated in favour of a system whereby water is forced up the intake by the action of the propeller. To reverse^ the engine is swivelled through an angle of 180 degrees, in which position the engine is automatic ally locked. When in the ahead posi tion the engine can tilt so that the pro peller may escape damage from sub merged obstructions. Further protec tion is conferred by the use of a soft brass pin which will ^near in the event of the propeller striking anything solid. Two lengths of shaft afe available, 23in and 28iij. Weight of the complete outboard engine dry with the stan dard shaft, is 41 lb and costs ^44 to buy. The inboard, known as the Mariner, is identical, so far as the motor is con cerned, with the outboard. The power unit being mounted upon a light alloy casting which also houses the bevel gear running in oil and giving a 2 : 1 reduc tion. Either a solid or reversing pro peller of loin diameter can be fitted. As the illustration plainly shows, the fuel tank is mounted beside the flywheel upon the water-cooled silencer and the installation of the engine and all its equipment is therefore simply a matter of bolting down the bedplate on to the bearers and con necting up the water and ex haust pipes. The total weight of the outfit which would be suitable for dinghies, canoes and river launches is 52 lb. - The makers do not, how ever, seem to have con sidered the use of this com pact inboard engine as an auxiliary for small yachts. It only measures i4in by 14m by nin, and could be tucked away in the stern, often below the cockpit, without difficulty, jvnd, in fact, might well solve the auxiliary problem for small yachts up to 20ft in length and even longer boats of light displacement. Its low weight would also prove to be an added and extremely important advantage, and it might well achieve considerable popularity when used for this purpose. Owing to the high cost of building these days, attention is focused on the small boat as never before and the market is one well worthy of cultiva tion. Difficulty would at once arise, how ever, because the engine would have to be started and serviced from the front as arranged at present, the starting cord would foul the tank. Of course, the latter could be taken off and put some where else, not necessarily attached to the engine, but the carburettor, plugs and other accessories would still be on the wrong side, and, owing to restricted space in small yachts, it would not be an easy matter to get round the engine to attend to it or to make adjustments. It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to turn the engine round on its base plate, and it might be worth marketing the Mariner so that it could be arranged with the drive in either direction. It is not difficult to think of other occasions when it might not be convenient to operate and service the engine from the rear and commend the suggestion for consideration. A point stressed by the makers is their intention to give a comprehensive after-sales service so that users may be assured of the utmost value and service from their equipment. 1 f i 1 1 182 Yachting World #Here they THE NEW B M B i BRITANNIA' and MARINER' ENGINES n u The 'MARINER' 4 h .p. 2 cylinder INBOARD ENGINE This sturdy, powerful unit is com pact and entirely self-contained.

I accept your quotation for the three sails at £27 delivered Bahrain. 3. You are correct in stating that the sizes of the main sail as shown in the drawing are not correct. Actual measurements as taken with the sail stretched on the ground are as follows: Foot .. 16 1 6' Edge of leach .. 26* 2' (the leach is actually hollow as shown in the drawing) Head (on gaff) .. 17 1 9' Luff .. 6 1 11' Measurement in a straight line from the peak to the clew .. 26'. 4. The hollow in the leach of the existing main sail is probably due to repairing done by drawing torn canvas together and most probably did not exist In the original sail. It has resulted as you observe in the very high clew (the mast has very little rake aft). I suggest that you make the sail with the head luff and foot measurements as given above, but that you widen the angle at the tack between the foot and the luff so as to give a straight edged leach (or even a l^each running out the way and not a hollow leach) of between 26* and 27' in length. £&gt;••••••- 2 - 5.

'1 STuarT Marine Lighting Plants Made at Henley -on-Thames, England. rpHE ADVANTAGE of having electricity afloat 1 as ashore, hardly needs stressing. Electric light is a comfort which has almost become a necessity, and no one who has experienced the pleasure of having it on a yacht is likely to be satis fied again with more primitive methods of lighting. It is many years now since the first Stuart plant was built for marine service—our present range described in the following pages has every improve ment that a long experience has taught us is worth while. We have aimed at producing plants which are quiet, free from vibration, and dependable. The fact that Stuart plants are regularly specified by the leading naval architects and consultants is encouraging to us, and their opinion is borne out by the number of marine plants we supply to firms for installation in Government vessels and special craft of all descriptions. In first cost our plants are not the cheapest on the market, but they are priced as low as is compatible with the Stuart standard of workmanship and the class of material used. The careful owner does not need reminding that it is a pity to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar. For silent, vibrationless running and reliability—instal a Stuart plant. Please do not hesitate to write to us for any further information or our recommendations for your par ticular case.300-WATTS. 500-WATTS.

The latter is not an arrangement we recommend, however, as the slightest noise becomes so obtrusive at night in a still anchorage. It also means the plant running irrespective of the amount of current required which is often uneconomical. 35 THEY SAY .... We like, as far as possible, to keep in touch with the owners of Stuart Plants, and their opinions are of real interest to us. They teach us a lot of things which only the actual user can find out, but it is very pleasant to have their praise more frequently than their criticism. The following extracts are taken from letters received in the last few years :— 4.7.47. —' This little engine is absolutely indispens able and runs like a watch, and always ready for a quick start. Used for lighting, deck wash and bilge pump you will quite understand how much we depend on her.' 4.7.47.—' The set has been dismantled after years of hard work in the R.N. and my engineer says ' It is a beautiful engineering job, filthy, but in perfect mechanical condition.' What a reputation you people have—one hears the same thing about you so often.' 24.3.47.—' I think they really are splendid little engines, especially this one, as I had no idea it was as old as 1925. It must be made of pretty good stuff.' 4.6.46.—' We installed the lighting set on Sunday and had a trial run and must certainly congratulate you on the quietness and lack of vibration when the fo'castle doors were closed. You were not aware the engine was running.' 7.11.46.—'I am very pleased to inform you the plant is giving every satisfaction. . . This plant has been inspected by Skippers and Engineers of other Ships fitted with steam lighting plants, who without exception, think the type 1 58 y for economy and efficiency is far superior to steam.''7 1000-WATTS. 1500-WATTS.

THE STUART ENGINE embodies all the latest improvements our unique experience in designing and building small marine and stationary engines suggest. Cylinder is of finest hard close-grained alloy cast iron. The bore is ground to limit gauges. The cylinder head, easily removed for decarbonisation, is water cooled, ensuring satisfactory conditions for the sparking-plug. Crankcase is of cast iron provided with an efficient compression retaining device, which will retain the crankcase compression perfectly and without wear even after years of service. Piston is of the finest cast iron, very light, and is fitted with two compression rings and hardened steel gudgeon pin. Connecting Rod is a drop fbrging with bronze small end and roller bearing big end. Crankshaft is a steel stamping with two largo ball bearings and is perfectly balanced. Carburettor is of first class British make and highly efficient under all loads, being adjusted with ease for different grades of petrol. Governor is mounted on the crankshaft, totally enclosed, and runs in an oil bath. Acting directly on the carburettor there is no 'hunting.' Speed is adjustable with the engine running. Ignition is by first-class British made magneto. In the larger plants it is driven by roller chain running in an oil bath. On the sets up to 750 watts size it is mounted on the crankcase and direct driven. 1011 Cooling is by means of the Stuart posi tive plunger type circulating pump of gunmetal. This is geared to run at one third of the engine speed and is an extremely simple and compact design ; a plunger pump is best since Switchboard supplied with 300 watt to 1500 watt plants is illustrated.

Direct Lighting Plants Nos. 108y, 158y and 308y, are providetl with a switchboard carrying :—Volt meter, Ammeter, D.P. Switch and Fuse, Shunt Regulator. Equipment.—Fuel tank and 5ft. of copper petrol pipe with unions, brass marine silencer, tools and driving pulley on dynamo end are included as standard equipment. reliability is so important.AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT. We can supply our plants with bilge pumps and/or compressors. Standard auxiliary equipment is des cribed below, but special units can always be otiered on our having details of your needs. Bilge Pumps.—These gunmetal pumps can bo mounted on the plant, and are supplied with base, drive and clutch to put the pump in and out of use. B.S.P. Connec- G.P.H.

These are water cooled compressors, single stage, with suction air filter, and suitable for pressures up to 3501bs. per square inch. Compressors for higher pressures can be supplied. Code Word: Compressor, 2*4 cu. ft. displacement pei min. (For 1000 watt plants) YVLUF Compressor, 4*5 cu. ft. displacement per min. (For 1500 and 3000 watt plants) YVLbU 1213 Delivery.—Delivery to your nearest Station in Groat Britain is included. Packing cases are credit ed on return, and should be sent back to us carriage paid. LAMPS. The gas-filled type is best. Fifteen watts give about twenty candle-power, twenty-five watts give about thirty candle-power. The number ot V cells used with Stuart plants ensures the best service from your bulbs, and battery, ami the highest efficiency. With 12/18 volt sets we use 7 cells as the lamps are 12/14 volt car type and a car dynamo generates 14 volts when running. SPECIAL PLANTS. In addition to our standard range of lighting plants we specialise in producing sets for particular requirements. Petrol pumping sets for K.A.r. refuelling launches, gas and fiameproof generators for petrol barges (under Lloyds' survey), general oi and compressor sets for Admiralty vessels, aio typical examples of recent plants we have manu factured. ACCESSORIES. The installation conditions vary so much with marine plants that we cannot include a standard set of installation gear. On the following page will be found particulars of equipment which will cover most installations, but we are always glad to be ot help in advising on the best arrangement tor any special craft.14 ACCESSORIES.

YVKYF Lightweight Plants.—Plants can be supplied in special lightweight construction. Weight of sizes up to 1000 watt get is reduced by about 20% and 1500 watt and 3000 watt sets by about 15%... YVKPA THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. We have recently carried out some interesting research and have found that the size and length of the exhaust pipe play a big part in the effective silencing of an engine and in its efficiency. Our experiments lead us to recommend that with sets up to 700 watts, the engine to silencer pipe should be 1' inside diameter, and the silencer to outlet pipe J' inside diameter. On 1000 watt and 1500 watt sets the respective sizes should be 1 J' and 1', and on the 3000 watt set they should be 1£' and 1'. The length of pipe from engine to silencer should be between 2ft. and 3ft. 6in., and the length from the silencer to the outlet not less than 2ft. 6in. If the system must be shortened, reduce the length of pipe from engine to silencer ; if lengthened, increase the length from silencer to outlet. We shall be pleased to give our recommendations for any difficult case where the ordinary arrange ment is not possible.MARINE BATTERIES LEAD ACID TYPE. B ritish M ade. These batteries are specially designed for Yacht Lighting and are assembled in robust containers of 'ebonite, specially deep to allow plenty of rolling space for acid. The cells are provided with sealed-in lids, with an acid level indicating device in a non-splash vent plug. The positive and negative plates are of flat pasted type, specially designed to prevent shedding of active material. The positive plates are enclosed 1617 in felted glass wool, retained in place by a perfor ated ebonite sheet placed against a treated wood separator. The plates and the separators form a solid unit which is a close fit in the ebonite box. The cells are supplied fully charged, with intercell connectors, and wood crates. The range of sizes is listed on pages 18 to 19. Well known for their ability to stand for long periods without injury. The steel containers and plates give great mechanical strength. The cells are immune from injury by over-charging, rapid dis charging or short circuiting. Non-corrosive and non- sulphating. This is the best Yacht Lighting Battery made and will give exceptionally long service. The Batteries are supplied with electrolite and fully charged. Inter-connections between cells and wood crates are included. The number of cells per crate can be arranged to suit the space available. The range of sizes is listed on pages 20 and 21.

Hudson Esq., The Agency, BAHRAIN. /?/. ^ / v. e -Supplement a ry Instructions for Initial Pilling and charging of Type NH10A batteries* The contents of one 2 oz» tin of dry flake electro lyte when dissolved in the correct amount of distilled water provides sufficient liquid electrolyte of correct specific gravity for filling one type NH10A battery. Note that the battery consists of two cells welded together, so that each cell must be filled with solution to just over plate level* Mixing Electrolyte and filling cells. Mix the electrolyte in accordance with the instruc tions on the tin, and which are repeated as follows:- 'HIGHLY CORROSIVE - Keep away from clothes and fingers. Use a plain iron, glass or porcelain vessel of not less than one pint capacity for mixing* On no account use soldered, tinned, aluminixm, copper or galvanised vessels* Put whole contents of the tin in the vessel and add three full tins of distilled water, using this tin for a measure* Stir solution with glass rod or wooden stick*' The specific gravity will be approx* 1*19 but there is no need to check this particularly* Remove the vent plug from each cell in the battery, and fill the cells to just over plate level* Allow battery to stand for say 12 hours, then as the plates will have absorbed a certain amount of the solution, restore the level within the cells by adding distilled water* Initial C h arging* With the vent plugs still out, the battery should now be charged at 1»5 amperes constant current for approx* /'V 16 hours* A charging voltage range 2»5/3»5 volts is needed* After end of charge allow six hours to elapse before inserting the vent plugs* This permits gases generated during charge to escape* Before fitting the vent plugs inspect the electrolyte levels in the cells and if below normal restore by adding distilled water.After inserting and tightening the vent plugjy rinse the outside of the battery in warm water, dry off, and it is advantageous to smear it all over with vaseline or other mineral jelly# It may then be inserted in the lamp case and is ready for use# Service Charging and Maintenance» The normal recharge is at 1»5 amperes lor 8 hoars# Before charging remove the vent plugs and check the electrolyte levels, topping up with distilled water if necessary 0° not replace the vent plugs until at least 6 hours have elapsed from end of charge. Completely change the electrolyte solution every hundred charges or every 18 months whichever occurs first# Electrolyte Renewal# Discharge the battery by leaving the bulb switched on until it bums dim, then empty the old solution from the cells. Rinse them out thoroughly with clean water, allow to drain for half an hour, then refill with new solution. Then proceed exactly as for Initial Pilling and Charging, except that the 12 hour standing period is omitted. Further information* . Any additional or more detailed information will gladly be provided by the Company on request# Nife Batteries Redditch#rtife o Handlamps Types NHS, NH10&amp;NH1 OA. INSTRUCTIONS (except for Collieries). HOME USE. Lamps are despatched in a charged condition and ready for use. Before issue for use in dangerous atmospheres the lid should be locked by sealing the hasp in position with a lead rivet. GENERAL: The lamp is focussed by screwi^- or unscrewing the lens bezel. To prevent undue wear of the bezel threads keep these well greased and if the lamp is used in a dusty atmosphere brush the threads occasionally to remove grit. Remove the battery occasionally and dry out any liquid which may have collected in the lamp bottom. Ic highly corrosive to fingers and organic matter. battery top lightly smeared with vaseline to prevent incrustation. RECHARGING: Remove lead rivet from lock and remove battery. Vent plugs (having wide rubber band) should be removed before charging and not replaced until about six hours after completion of charge. See that solution well covers the plates before putting on charge. TOPPING UP: Battery will require topping up with pure distilled water about every fourth time of charging. Plates should be just covered. CHARGING RATE: Type NHS—0'75 amperes for 8 hours. Type NH10 and NH10A—1'5 amperes for 8 hours. SPECIFIC GRAVITY: Gives no indication of state of charge. It should be within limits of 1160 and 1'200. Specific gravity readings entirely unnecessary if solution is completely changed about every hundred charges. WARNING: Lead battery Acid will destroy a NIFE battery. Use NIFE Electrolyte type 'A'. EXPORT. Lamps are despatched with battery empty and 'A' type electrolyte in solid form, which is to be mixed in accordance with the instructions on the drum. 4 NitFE BATTERIES, • RCOOITCH • WORCESTERSHIRE I34/5M/6/47 BL.TELEGRAMS: 'ARMY, SOWEST.
