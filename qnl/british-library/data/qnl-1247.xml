Later I enquired at the C.C. who could give me a copy of the Air Navigation Agreement but they could not enlighten me with regard to the payments. Finally I made enquiries in the Bahrain Govt* Accounts Department through the Head Munshi with a view to ascertain the date on iastxHaymKRi which similar payment was made last time* , enquiry revealed that this payment is alv/ays made by direct credit to the Bahrain Govt. Account in London by^the F.O., and payment has been received inclusive of the sum o^ £1,139-3-0 claimed as per the enclosure to the p.u.c. It is a matter for regret that Residency have not given clear instructions. Obviously the enclosures to the are merely for our information. Without mentioning this, Residency have said “amounts payable to the Shaikh of Bahrain which term made me spend a considerable amount of time in searching records. J May issue the draft below if approved for the xacmB sake of confirmation to Residency. A new file will have to be opened in which these papers are to be filed, as I do not find any files with similar papers in the Agency at the moment. r^'C ' cKil ^ da k a, TM k&gt; NO'gg(dL{ 'V</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000326_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1167</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000326</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1167</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/60 I Bahrain Air Navigation Agreement Re Payments.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1950/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-17T11:47:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>The correspondence is arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file, except where enclosures of an earlier date are filed after their relevant covering letter, and terminates with a set of notes on folio 9.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 9; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns payments due to the Shaikh of Bahrain (Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah) under the terms of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement (also referred to in the file as the Air Navigation Agreement).
