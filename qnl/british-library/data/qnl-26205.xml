'BANDRA' from Debai ... 'Sheikh Debai refuses boats and coolies for Sharjah. Arriving 7 p.m. tonight. Can you arrange.' I sent an officer ashore to bring Isa off. The latter was out at the Aerodrome and it was not till 2000 that he arrived on board. He (Isa) stated that they had been expecting the Mail Steamer since daylight and that the Sehikh of Sharjah had had ample dhows and coolies ready all day. As Mail Steamer had not arrived by sunset he had withdrawn his dhows into the creek and sent away the coolies. It was low water at 2200 and there was a strong north westerly wind blowing. S.S. ’'BANDRA' arrived at 2015 and anchored about 1-J- miles from the shore. I boarded her on arrival. It was the Captain’s first visit to Sharjah. He told me his orders were to call at Debai and Sharjah. He arrived at Debai at 1600 and discharged what little cargo he had for Debai in a very short time. The B.I. Agent told him that as Sharjah had no dhows and no coolies it was the custom for the Mail Steamer to discharge any cargo she might have for Sharjah into Debai dhows and to two them full of Debai coolies to Sharjah. The Residency Agent informed me that there was no truth whatever in this assertion and that Sharjah had plenty of dhows and coolies. The B.I. Agent further informed the Captain of the 'Bandra' that the Sheikh of Debai had now refused to allow any of his dhows or coolies to proceed to Sharjah to unload any Imperial Airways stores, hence his (the Captain’s) signal to me. S.S. 'Bandra' had on board Mr. White (Camp Supervisor of Imperial Airways at Shaibah) one Iraqi w/T operator, rifles and ammunition for Guards, Tentage and various other Imperial Airways stores. On my return t 0 my ship I sent Isa ashore to instruct the Sheikh that lighters and coolies must be sent off at once as the Mail Steamer was already 24 hours late. This incident shows clearly, I think, the sort of attitude we may expect in the future from the Sheikh of Debai towards anything to do with the Aerodrome at Sharjah, despite the clear warning given to him by the Political Resident on 1st September. 3 . Dhows and coolies were sent off at daylight and Mr. White, the operator, and all stores were safely landed, s.s. 'Bandra' left for Henjam at 0900 . I went ashore to HR SENIOR NAVAL CFFICER, visit/ PERSIAN GULP DIVISION. (Copy to Staff Officer (I), Colombo).2 visil/|the Aerodrome at 07 CO. Work on the Rest house is temporarily suspended owing t 0 non arrival of cement. There was no news as to when it would arrive. Wireless masts are up and set is working. Captain Mackay was away at Basrah out is expected to arrive by flying boat on Thursday, 29 th September. Flight Lieutenant Dalton-Morris and the three R.A.F. W/T ratings are still there. The large generator gave out and is beyond repair, but they have a small one which is working satisfactorily. a new generator is expected to arrive by Flying boat on 29 th September, and when it is in working orde F/L Dalton-Morris and his three ratings expect to proceed by flying boat to Bahrain to start erecting a Wireless Station there. 4 . I duly handed over the 1400 rupees, which I had drawn at Muscat, to the Residency Agent in accordance with the Political Residant r s request. The Residency Agent requested me to bring to the notice of the authorities concerned that it would be a great convenience to the Sheikh of Sharjah if a W/T Signal could be made a few hours before arrival of Mail Steamer, giving probable time of arrival, so that dhows and coolies snould be ready. 5 . Ship left Sharjah at midnight 23rd September and arrived at Basidu, a.m. 24 th September. Both Platoons were landed for drill. I handed over to the Custodian tne two Union Jacks and his pay for July. He informed me that Hussain had left for Bandar Abbas five days ago. His family is still at Basidu and he has not disposed of his property. The Custodian further informed me that a new Persian Collector of Customs arrived about six weeks ago who refuses to allow any commodities (such as tea, coffee, sugar, flour, rice, etc., to enter British Basidu.

You will see that Biscoe’s suggestion is that the Bahrein- Gwadur stage might be used during the summer.

I that this objection might appl^to any adoption of the proposal for an extended period even in the summer months. Possibly however, you may think it worth while to consider whether a BahnBahrein-Gwadur stage (with I suppose some temporary arrangement for accommodation at Bahrein) could be adopted as a stop-gap if ohe Persian Government's decision is unfavourable and pending pro vision of the depot ship for Yas Island.

The Foreign Office were in agreement with Mr, Hoare , s proposed line of action* Mr* Hoare probably thought It best not to try to force the pace by raising the question forthwith since it would quite likely arise naturally in the course of the negotiations for the proposed general treaty with Persia, the present permit became necessary an extension of twelve months should be sought: he was anxious to avoid the purchase of a yacht for use at Yas Island unnecessarily* Colonel 5helmerdln e said that a shorter extension (with the possibility or renewal) would be acceptable* Arrangements for the operation of the alternative route could probably be completed in two months. press for a provisional extension pending the conclusion ol t-he general treaty negotlationsj but the general treaty negotiations might not run as smoothly as we hoped, and might break down altogether, so that the Persian Government might refuse to give us a provisional extension of the Pe.rsian route* In such circumstances Mr* Hoare would probably try for a final extension of the present permit, in order to enable arrangements lor the Arabian route to be completed* ifce could not, however, be ^iue that the Persian Government would be willing to give an extension Mr* Baxter in reply to Mr* »alt on said that as M, 1 almourtaohe had only just returned to Persia from Kurope Mr* Grieve suggested that if a temporary extension of Mr* Baxter thought that Mr. Hoare would first of allof any kind* although the prospects now seemed more hopeful than they had appeared some months ago* Colonel Shelmerdlne said that he felt it would be an error in tactics io ask for a final extension as this would make it extremely difficult* if not impossible* to seek a further extension* even if the French and Dutch obtained one# Mr# Baxter said that Mr# do are 1 s telegram was being referred tothe Air Ministry for observations and it was agreed that this question of a temporary extension as well as that of any variations desirable in Imperial Airways 1 agreement should be dealt with in the Air Ministry reply to the Foreign Office# i'he Air Ministry will communicate with Imperial Airways Ltd# on this latter point# (It was considered to be undesirable to put forward any request for amendments of a drastic nature )# The Air Ministry memorandum for the Meeting which had been circulated on the 12th February was then discussed# Captain Cunningham remarked that the Admiralty observed that the Air Ministry considered alternative (2) in the memorandum as impracticable because the distance from Bahrein to Gwadar (770 miles) was too great to fly In one day, although a previous proposal had conterqplated flying from Dabai to Karachi (a greater distance) in one day# Group Captain Pelrso pointed out that the possibility of a night stop on the Crucial Coast was the danger under the Bahrein•Gwadar proposal# Ci aptaln Cunningham said the Admiralty thought that since an e me rgeney re fuelling and night stopping point would be required on the Musandam Peninsular the permanent refuelling point might be established there instead of at Kas-al-Khaimah# lie suggested the possibility of using* according to the wind direction, one or other of two inlets on the Peninsular separated by a narrow neck of land# Group Captain Pelrse said that the Information at present in possession of the Air ministry indicated that air currents over those inlets were often exceptionally turbulent and made them unsafe for use by aircraft# Living conditions were worse on the Musandam Peninsular than at Yas Island and a regular stop there was not contemplated - only an emergency halt. Adverse winds were not the only source of forced landings* and the use oi ¥as Island, by shortening the journey by 2 hours, correspondingly reduced the risk of unforeseen landings and incidents on the Trucial coast# Captain Cunningham said that the Admiralty did not come into the question of which of the two alternatives mentioned in the memorandum was the better; but so far as they vere concerned they agreed to the use of Yas Island as contemplated in proposal ( 1 ) and to the use of Kas-al-Khaimah for daylight refuelling in view of the Political nesident^ telegram of the 4th February. Mr# Baxter said that there migfct be strong objection to basing the yacht on lienjam and If this were contemplateu it would be necessary to consult Mr# Hoare and the rolitic&amp;l i^biuent Mr# Walton said that the India Office would inform the Government of* india and the Political Kesl&amp;ont of alternative proposal ( 1 ) (I#e# to operate the service with night stops at Yas Island and Gwadar, with daylight refuelling at Ras-al-Khaimah and an emergency refuelling and night stopping point on the Musandam Peninsular) and ask for his observations.

In rep^ly to Mr* Grieve he said that accommodation on land would not toe essential at the outset in order to operate the service and if necessary a refuelling barge could toe anchored at a suitable spot in the first instance* Mr* Baxter enquired whether a definite decision had been y taken to operate the Basra-Bahrein section with landplanes* It I would toe necessary to fly outside the three mile limit off the Hasa Coast, and in previous correspondence it had been contemplated that flying boats would toe used* There were at present no emergency landing grounds on the Hasa Coast, and although the Political Resident had recently had a satisfactory conversation with King Iton Baud on the subject, it was uncertain when such emergency landing grounds would toe established* Colonel Bhelmerdlne replied that a definite decision had been taken to operate this sector with landplanes, and that the Air Ministry did not think that emergency landing grounds in the Hasa were essential from the point of view of Imperial Airways Ltd. Mr* Grieve remarked that the cost of the present proposal was a substantial additional load on this air route. Mr.Holloway agreed tout said that the estimates had been compiled on the 'full 1 * side * In reply to Colonel Bhelmerdine, Mr* Grieve said that Treasury acquiescence in the scheme could toe assumed in the absence of any alternative and on the assumption that the Government would not be prepared to suspend the route purely on grounds of additional expense* The prospect of agreement with Persia appeared to be very much more hopeful* The scheme was still provisional and he did not think that formal sanction was necessary at this stage* Group Captain Pelrse did not think there was any need to refer the matter again to the inlsterial Bub-Committee at the moment* Major Hind said that if an agreement were reached between the departments concerned it would suffice if he placed a not e of this Meeting before the chairman of the Ministerial Bub-Committee with a view to its toeing circulated to the members of the bub-Committee* Mr* tfalton said that the India Office would like to obtain the remarks of the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the scheme before this was done* This was agreed*P.2.1089/32.

Department. The Inter-departmental Meeting held at the Air Ministry on 15th February discussed the memorandum on the file below. It will be seen from the memorandum that,as it has not been possible to obtain an agreement with either of the Trucial Sheikhs who were approached, it is not considered advisable to proceed with the project of a night stop on the Trucial Coast. The remain ing alternatives are to locate a night stop at Bahrein or at Yas Island. The former would give too long a stage to be relied on for a day's flight to Gwadur all the year round. It is true, as was meeting pointed out by the Admir&amp;lty representative at the/, that a stage from Debai to Karachi, as previously suggested, would have been even longer, but this ( would not have mattered as a good emergency stopping place would have been available at Gwadur which could have been used as frequently as desired; on Tl [fj Y 7f/l2 r ^ h-s ff. i. 2Hb 3000 8 31 the other Imnd, with a stage from Bahrein to Gwadur there would be no intermediate stopping place satisfactory enough to be used except for rare emergencies. It was accordingly agreed that the Air Ministry's second alternative, viz. a night stop at Yas Island,with a stage from there to Gwadur, should be adopted. This is subject to any observations which the Government of India or Colonel Biscoe may make^but there is no reason to anticipate that they will dissent. The proposal to establish a night stop at Yas Island is a new one*but it is obviously preferable to the risks and expenditure involved in a night stop on the mainland/1 '• 21 Jj Hvf IH ! ' Finland m the absence o£ an agreement »ith the Sheikh concerned. Yas island belongs to- th® Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. A petrol tank and an oil tank have already been placed on the island in connection with the Military air route. The Sheikh did not give his consent to this but was informed by Colonel Biscoe in November 1930 that we should have to go ahead with the installation of the tanks. This Sheikh is a mere figure-head set up by his uncle who is believed to have been responsible for the assassination of the last Sheikh ( the third Slni-hassassinated at Abu Dhabi Jiml922). In the circumstances it is useless .0 expect the Sheikh to take any responsibility. He would probably not agbeo to anything which wo proposed but he would acQUiesce in a j£kiCt.Q. situation as he did in 1930. It should perhaps be stated that while the tanks were being installed in 1930 Captain Prior, the Political Agent Behrein, visited Yas and met there a representativ of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi who seemed to fear that we were settling down in the Island; Captain Prior thereupon wrote a letter to the Sheikh to the effect that it was intended only to instal some petrol tanks and that no buildings would be erected. It is not contemplated, however, that even in connection with the present proposal any buildings woptld be erected. The passengers would be accommodated on a depot ship off Yas Island, and the ship will not necessarily be stationed off the island permanently but may (as was explained at the meeting) move to and. fro between there and Bahrein. The Political authorities may think it advisable .when the time comes/Minute Paper. Department. 214b 3000 8 31 comes^ to inform the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of our intention. The flying boats would have to use Ras-al-Khaimah for refuelling; there is, of course, already a petrol barge at that place in connection with the Military air route. It will also be desired to have an emergency night stop somewhere on the east side of the Musandim peninsula^ but the best place for this has not yet been located. The commencement and the rate of pro gress of the preparations depend on the Persian Government’s attitude in regard to the South Persia permit. It will be seen from papers submitted concurrently on another file that the Foreign Office sent a reminder on this subject to Mr. Hoare on 10th February and that the latter has replied that he is sure that so long as the Minister at Court believes in the probability of a general treaty settlement, Imperial Airways will be allowed to function. Mr. Hoare intends to press, about the end of February, for a provisional permit unless Tairnourtache makes a move meanwhile. The F.O. ' were asked at the meeting whether Mr. Hoare could not make a definite proposal before the end of the month, but they were of opinion that this is a question of tactics which is much better left to the Minister. Colonel Shelmerdine thought that it would be possible to get ready the depot ship in time at about a month’s notice. Ii ^he Persian* attitude turns out after all to be against giving a permit provisionally pending the progress of the general treaty negotiations, then they could be pressed/pressed for a short definitive extension of the permit sufficient to allow preparations on the Arab side to be completed (as suggested in the Air Ministry letter of 5th February at P.Z.796/32) If on the other hand, as seems now to be quite probable, weget a provisional extension of the permit (pending the treaty negotiations end a consequent permanent extension) such provisional extension might be without fixed limit of date, or it might be/a limited period, which would be renewed, from time to time so long as ohe uieu^y negotiations continued. In either event, if the Persians being dissatisfied with the progress of the general negotiations threatened to close the provisional permit J we should have some warning in advance so as to be able to complete preparations for the Arab route. Naturally it is not desired to embark on expenditure on these preparations until it is more or less certain that they will be necessary; in particular-as regards the depot ship it will not be desired to purchase a vessel so long as it is probable that the South Persia permit will continue. The arrangements proposed are thus very contingent on what happens at Tehran, but we Arould be ready to complete final arrangements at short notice. A draft telegram to the Government of India and Colonel Biscoe, in which the Air Ministry concur, is submitted. It will be seen that the change from land planes to flying boats will be effected at Bahrein. This may seem to raise the question of emergency landing grounds on the HaBa coast to which Ibn Saud has not yet agreed (though I understand/i Minute Paper. &amp; Department. understand that at his recent meeting with (Colonel Biscoe he showed a more forthcoming attitude on the subject than he had previously done). The Foreign Office representative raised this point but appeared to be satisfied with the explanation given by the Air Ministry that the question is really more or less academic since, even if Ibn Saud's permission is obtained to the use of certain defined places as landing grounds, it would not by any mec?ns follow that it v/ould be possible to use precisely those places for emergency lendings, and Ibn Srud cannot in practice object to any place on his coast being used for a landing in an emergency.

Ir ioute. 1. tlheir second meeting held on the I7th December, 1931 the Standing Ministerial subcommittee for * uestiona Concerning the Middle Sast of the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) to accept an estimate of probable expenditure involved in the establishment of an air route along the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulf as follows :- (i) an initial capital cost of £17,000 to £20,000; (ii) a recurring oash expenditure for the first two years of £15,000 to £17,000 per annum on operating charges; (iii) in later years an annual expenditure of from £25,000 to £30,000 per annum including allowance foi extra obsolescence. (If the section Basrah to Karachi is closed to Imperial Air aye the net compennation payable might amount to £30,000 per annum\ (b) that the Air Ministry should be authorised to sanction thi- despatch by Imperial Airways of an officer to make a complete and detailed survey of a civil air route along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. (c) that ae regards the proposals of the Air Ministry for the erection of a rest house, etc., ( 1 ) nothing should be done until further information is received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq.— (ii) on receipt of such information the Air Ministry should consult the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury and the India Office, and when inter departmental agreement has be tn reached immediate measures for the construction of a rest house shoulc be put in hand* 2. (a) was based on proposals for operating the England- India air service with a night-stop at Ras-al-Khaimah. On the 20th December, 1931 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported the failure of negotiation# with the sheikh of Ras-al-akimah for the desired facilities and said that he thought it was useless to make further efforts there as the Sheikh, although himself showing some disposition to come to terms wa^ powerless in face of local opposition* Negotiations were then begun with the sheikh of Dabai with a view to using Dabai instead of Ras-al-Khaimah as the ni ;ht stopping place in the Gulf. The Political Resident has now reported, however, that the sheikh of Dabai is unwilling to accept responsibility of affording the desired facilities to Imperial Airways Ltd* It has consequently been necessary to consider further are t0 oparat* th* A-1. Y&amp;o Island and Gwadar, or 2. Bahrein an' r'wadar. Alternative 1 entails the provision of a boat for ag a depot ship; the accoBL. odation of passengers overnight at Tag Island; and the construction of a rest house at Gwadar. Its advantages are :• (a) a better division of stages between Baar. h and Karachi, i.e., (1) Basrah - Tas Island (refuelling at Bahreini - 595 statute miles; (ii) Yas Island - Gwadar (refuelling at ^as-al-Khaiaah/ 665 statute miles. (iii Gwadar - Karachi - 305 statute miles; (by the stage between Yaa Island and Gwadar can be flown with a daylight refuelling halt at Has-al-Khaimah and the possibility of having to spend a night on the Trucial coast is practically eliminated. (o) maximum security since Yas Island is uninhabited. Proposal 2 . involves a stage of 770 miles from Bahrein to Gwadar in one day and ig on that account impracticable all the year round. This long stage may involve over 10 hours* flying (on the assumption of a 20 miles an hour head wind). In winter the hours of daylight are insufficient for this, when allowance is made for the time spent in re-fUelling. Adverse weather conditions and the small margin of daylight would almost inevitably cause occasional night halts on the Truoial coast and the objections to this have already been pointed out. Proposal 1. is, therefore, put forward as the more practicable scheme: though it shares the grave disadvantage of the other that it involves the loss of one day in the scheduled time for air mails between England and Karachi, apart from the additional mileage involved in any oase in flying an Arabian coast route. The change over from landplanee to flying boats would be effected at Bahrein as under the previous scheme. Facilities for refuelling will still be required at Pas-al-Khaimah. The Political Resident does not anticipate that there will be any opposition to thi^» In addition, it will be necessary to establish an emergency refuelling and night stopping point where a petrol barge could be moored,somewhere on the eastern side of the ^uesandam peninsular. The provision^of a boat to be moored at Yas Island represents additional expenditure as compared with the previous proposal to operate the service with one night stop in the •far si an Gulf at Raa-al-Khaiaiah. The boat would have to be purchased from outside sources since the Admiralty have no ruitable craft for disposal which could be fitted out for the purpose. It would not be an economical proposition to charter a boat on account of the high charges involved. If the route ie abandoned the boat should, however, be a saleable asset.Against this exp end it lire, however, the payment of £ 3 ,COO a year for protection at nas-al-Khaimah would be saved; for the seven years which Imperial Airways 1 agreement has still to run this would represent a total saving of £21,000. The provision of a rest house at Gwadar can be regarded as roughly th* equivalent of a raet house at fes-al-Chaimah. A revised financial statement showing the effect of the new scheme is attached. 3. As regards the second decision (b) of the Minieterial subcommittee (vide page 1 of this memorandum) Imperial Airwaye Ltd. sent Lieut. Commander Calpin, S.W. (Retd#) te the Persian Oulf to make the survey. On the advice of the British Resident, however, he id not attempt to continue this survey beyond Bahrein owing to the attitude of the Trucial coast Sheikhs to the service. He is now at marachi. 4. The third decision of the Ministerial Subcommittee concerned immediate measures for the construction of a rest house on the Trucial coaet. The revised proposals contained in paragraph ( 2 ) above do not, however, envisage a rest house there, but a depot ehip for use at Taa Island and a rest house at Gwadar. It should be possible to procure and fit out a suitable vessel in a comparatively short time. The Company have made preliminary enquiries in this connection already. Arr ngemento can also be improvised without much delay at Gwadar to tide over the period while the rest house is being constructed. But even if the necessary steps were taken immediately the arrangements for starting operations could not be completed by the 3lat March when the present permit from the Persian Government expires. In thess circumstances the i^oreign Office have been asked to instruct H.M. Representative at Tehran to apply forthwith for at least a temporary extension of the permit. It is under 3 tM that the Persian Governments attitude is now more reasonable and that there is some prospect that they will agree to a continuance of operations along the present route. Until the position has become clearer it may be desirable not to incur the expenditure involved in the proposals in para raph 2 # In any case, if permission for on extension of any description is refused by the Persians, the only means of preventing the service from being interrupted until the necessary arrangements under paragraph 2 have been completed will be to call upon the R•A• • to operate the section Bahrein-Carachi. Their assistance to this extent would enable the mail service to be suiintained but passenger bookings ould have to be suspended.R?,TI SST A» OXIMATI 5STIMAT* OF AB ITIOHAL AJCNOaL COST OF OPB JLTIITO FROM BAHREIN TO XA'hACHT 'QtS CALCUTTA FLYIRG BOATii FOLLOWING THE A ABIiH COAST. 1. 2 . 3. 4. 5 • 6 • 7.

MINUTE SUGGESTED REPLY. Please see the Air Ministry letter below giving their draft reply to this Question for to morrow. It not seem to be entirely satisfactory for two reasons - (a) to say that we hope the negotiations with Persia will be successful before March 31st might give the impression that we are in the Persians’ hands and are pathetically anxious to secure a renewal of the concess ion from them (we are, more or less, but do not want them to know it).

The Air Ministry are holding a preliminary meeting with Imperial Airways end will then call a meeting of the Departments concerned in accordance with conclusion (c) of the Ministerial Subcommittee's meeting of 17th December. We might ask the C.I.D. Secretariat to circulate to members of the Ministerial Sub committee the Political Resident's telegram of 4th February for information in continuation of the previous telegrams which were so circulated. The position in regard to the South Persian route is not, I think, so definite as Colonel Biscoe understands. Para. 3 of his tele gram is probably based on the assurance given by Tainiurtache to Sir J. Simon that he would try on his return to Tehran to arrange a provisional extension (pending negotiations on all outstand ing ijiatters). The F.O. instructed Mr. Hoare to open the matter with Taimurtache a fortnight after the letter's return. We have not heard anything later from the F.O., and it will be proposed at the interdepartmental meeting that the F.O. should send definite instructions to Mr. Hoare to raise the question. If the provisional extension of the South/South Persian permit is afteijall not obtained there appear^ to be the following possicle alternative courses of action as regards the .Arab route:- (l). The course submitted by Colonel Biscoe; that the night stop should be established at Bahrein and that the next day's stage should be from Bahrein to Gwadur, Ras-al-Khaimah being used as a re-fuelling station; there would then be a short stage from Gwadur to Karachi. The day's flight from Bahrein to Gwadur would not be so long as that previously proposed from Deoai though slightly longer than Ras-al-Khaimah to Karachi. An ac uUf-_ non-stop flight from Bahrein to Gwadur might be toj) long but this difficulty may be removed if a re fuelling station can be established at Ras-al- Khaimeh; the other difficulty about the establish ment of a night stop at Bahrein is that it lengthens the schedule by the addition of the short day's flight from Gwadur to Karachi; but this may be a small matter compared with the difficulties of the alternative courses of action. (2). The only other alternative as regards the Arab route which appears to be really i practicable is to establish a night stfcp on the Trucial Coast (preferably^Ras-al-Khaimah) end take adequate measures to protect it ourselves since the Sheikh, though he says that he will not inter fere, declines absolutely to accept any responsi bility. In view of the Sheikh's attitude it appears that no measures of protection are likely to be adequate short of garrisoning the place either by a small force of Assyrian levies as Colonel/Minute Paper, Department, Colonel Biscoe suggests, or by some other means. Colonel Biscoe points out, however, that a garrison would arouse considerable resentment along the coast. Nevertheless, if we establish a night-stop at Ras-al-Khairnah, it seems essential to have a garrison as the only means of ensuring the safety of the passengers. With the Sheikh and his people maintaining an attitude of sulky non-co-operation^it is impossible to overlook the risk of acts of sabotage or hostility by the local population; apart from this, moreover, the Sheikh will take mo responsibility (and it is obviously impossible to enforce'it on him) for protection against attacks from outside his jurisdiction, and the danger of such attacks appears to be very substantial; the Shihuh of the neighbouring hills have already threatened to attack Ras-al-Kh&amp;imeh if facilities are granted; besides these there are the Bedouin tribes of the interior (e.g. Manasir and 'Awamir) 1 who are constantly raiding and attacking the Trucial Sheikhdoms; a recent report from the S.N.O. dated 12th October, 1931, states that the Trucial Coast has been much troubled by these marauders last year, and that there is little or no security. (3). The alternative of establishing a night-stop at Ras-al-Khaimeh without taking measures to protect it by any sort of garrison seems too risky to be seriously consideied. The R.A.F. might be able to deal effectively with the parties responsible for a raid or attack on the I 3 ... ns, ' establishment after it had occurred, but the^demage would by then have already been done. If passengers on the air route should be killed, injured or kidnapped ; as a result of an attack on the night rest establishment, the effect on the reputation of Imperial Airways and of the air route to India would obviously be serious. It is not sufficient to be able to punish the parties re sponsible for such an attack after it hci6 occurrec, but it seans essential to take all practicable stepjs to prevent the risk of any such incident occurring. It is submitted that at the Inter- Departmental Meeting the I.O. representative, subject to the course of the discussion, should support alternative (l) or failing that &gt; alternative (2)above or any other practicable proposals which may be brought forward and which would provide for the safety of the air route. It seems out of the question to be con tent with simply telling the Sheikh that we shall hold him responsible. Apart from the fact that he is an independent potentate, it would be futile to use coercion in the sense of trying to force on him responsibilities which he declines to accept, especially responsibility for protecting our establishment from attacks by his own enemies from outside his jurisdiction.

In accordance with the conclusion of the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee on 17 November 1931, and after correspondence regarding a subsequent suggestion of the Air Ministry, instructions were sent on 28 November to Colonel Biscoe to endeavour to secure an agreement with either Ras ai Khaimah or Umm al Qawain. Subsequently the A.O.C. found Um al Qawain unsuitable, but Debai feasible. Instructions were sent to Colonel Biscoe on 3 December to include Debai in his negotiations Colonel Biscoe first sounded the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah v £ who asked for time to discuss the matter with his relat' He then sounded Debai whose attitude was friendly. He then went back to Ras al Khaimah who refused to enter into an agreement; he said that if the Government liked to establish a station neither he nor his people would interfere but that he would accept no responsibility. After continuing his tour (Muscat and Sur) Colonel Biscoe returned to Ras al Khaimah on 19 December and found that the opposition there had strengthened among the leading men and that the Shihuh (of the mountains of the Musandim Peninsula) had also threaten ed to attack the place if facilities were accorded. Colonel Biscoe accordingly had to give up the prospect of obtaining any agreement at Ras al Khaimah and went (20 December) again to Debai; unfortunately the Sheikh of Debai was seriously ill (I understand that the R.A.F. Doctor who examined him was satisfied that this was so) and negotiations had to be suspended for a/Minute Paper. Department. a fortnight. On 12 January Colonel Biscoe telegraphed that he had spent four days at Debai; the Sheikh’s unfortunate illness had prevented his discussing the matter properly with his relatives and much opposition had meanwhile developed among a faction who two years ago were strong enough almost to force the Sheikh’s abdication and whose views he can hardly ignore; the Sheikh therefore asked for time to try to overcome this opposition and promised an interim report on 16 January and his final reply on or soon after 23 January. week; the interim reply is given in Colonel Biscoe’s of the question of the location of the night stop has been discussed with Major Hind of the C.I.D. Secretariat. It will be remembered that conclusion (c) of the Ministerial Sub-Conmittee’s meeting of 17 December (flag B)was that on receipt of the necessary information from the Political Resident and the A.O.C. the Air Ministry should consult the Departments named and that when interdepartmental agreement has been reached immediate measures for the construction of a rest house should be put in hand. Debai’s reply is favourable or not. If it is favourable matters will be simple. The terms of the agreement of 20th December - see flag A) will have to be consider- ! ed, but this involves matters of detail which can probably/ final If Colonel Biscoe receives the/mswer by the date promised we ought to have a report early next telegram of 20 January (copy attached). The procedure for the further consideration A good deal depends on whether the Sheikh of (sketched in the enclosure to Colonel Biscoe’s despatchMinute Paper. Department. probably be settled by discussion between the Departments concerned. If, on the other hand, the Sheikh's reply is unfavourable, the question of the course of policy to be pursued as regards establishing a night stop on the Trucial Coast or adopting some other alternative will arise and after the interdepartmental discussion it will probably be necessary to bring this question at an early date before the Ministerial Sub-Coranittee. It will be observed that the agreement which we have endeavoured to negotiate with one of the two Sheikhs would fix on the Sheikh responsibility for the safety of the establishment so far as he and his dependants and subjects are concerned and further for ^ protection so far as possible against marauders from outside his jurisdiction. It is clear that, if we have no such agreement and assumption of responsibility by the local ruler, the danger to passengers etc. both from attacks from outside the Sheikhdom and from unruly elements within it, will be very much greater, and it seems very probable that it would be necessary to provide for protection by the permanent entertainment of an armed guard if it is decided to establish the night stop at Has al Khaimah or Debai. This, which would amount practically to occupation, would presumably involve much greater expense than has hitherto been contemplated. The two fundamental questions of defence and of expenditure thus arise at once if the Sheikh of Debai's answer is unfavourable. On the question of defence a very wide divergence of view between the Air Ministry and the Admiralty has already manifested itself. In view of the urgency it will probably be desirable that 214b 3000 8 31 the/Minute Paper. Department. the matter should be brought as soon as possible before a meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Corrmittee^but a meeting of the Departments named in conclusion (c) of 17 December will be held before the matter is submitted to the Ministerial Sub-Committee in order that clear cut issues may be placed before the latter. In regard to the connected question of the South Persian route, the position is that Taimourtache on 23 December (the day on which he left London) assured Sir John Simon that he wished on his return to resume negotiations on all outstanding matters, including the air route, and that if a settlement of other questions were not reached in time he would try to arrange the provisional extension of Imperial Airways’ permit as circumstances might require. The F.O. on 15 January instructed Mr. Hoare that he might broach the matter with Taimourtache if the latter does not himself take the initiative within a fortnight of his return. It will thus be seen that if we can rely on Taimourtache’s assurance, there is a prospect of the South Persian route continuing provisionally pending negotiations for a general treaty with Persia. Nevertheless, it is obviously necessary to make alternative arrangements for tie continuance of the air service to India in case the South Persian permit is not extended. Failing an agreement with the Sheikh of Debai, the best interim arrangement might possibly be a night stop at Bahrein and a H long-hop M from Bahrein to Gwadur.

As I told you on the telephone, I think it is almost impossible on our present scheme to eliminate white staff from this night halt - at any rate at the opening of the service. Colonel Biscoe lays great stress on whether we could, in the last resort, operate without a white staft and, put in this way, one can only answer that it is possible just as we operated through Lingeh without any white staff. The difference, however, is that at Debai there would necessarily be a wireless station, while at Lingeh there was none, and Lingeh has never been a night stop. I doubt if this Station can be maintained and operated successfully, at any rate for some time, without a white operator, and if we were to get a Eurasian operator I am not sure that he would be any more acceptable to the locals than a pure white.

Adi in opening the meeting, stated that the estimates ao given &gt;y the Treasury cad the Air Ministry did net agree. It voula, therefore, first -)f ail, he necessary to determine as far as prssiole, the prchahle cost involved. MAJOR ELLIOT said that the figures given by the Treasury had been obtained from Imperial Airways, had not had an opportunity of examining the figures now submitted by the Air Ministry, in which, however, he noted no allowance had been made for depreciation. THE MARQUEES 0? L01ID0NDSRRY stated that the figures as subsequently given by the .Mr Ministry represented ^ne maximum expenditure which they considered was likely to be incurred. SIS SIGKUITD DAH1IRBUTHER also censidered that the estimates now given hy the Air Ministry w?uid prohahly not he exceeded. The Question cf depreciation would n«t arise should it he possible to renew the service along the Persian route, as it was covered in the existing agreement with Imperial Airways, find in any case would not have to he considered for the first two years. It was impossible to / - 1tell what the situation ytouIJL he in iv,o'yeans r 111116 vihen some expense to meet the cost of renewals would' he necessary* Meanwhile, a capital cost of, at the most, £ 17 ,tnQ would he involved, plus an annual recurring cost v.hich should not exceed £15,000 a year. He stated that as long as Calcutta Flying boats, provision for depreciation of which was already nf.de under the subsidy agreement, were used no now expenditure as regards depreciation was anti cipated. It was possible that in two years’ time Imperial hirways might ash either for i capital grant or an increase of subsidy if new machines were to be employed. SIR JOHN SALMOND wished to point out that the route along the Arabian coast was essential for strategic reasons and had already been partially developed. THH CHAIRMAN said that it wcs obvious that for the first two years an expenditure of £15,000 a year was pro bable, and that after this period ..e must contemplate an increased cost should it be impossible to resume the service along the Persian coast. MR* GRIEV'D said that ^-0 this basis no depreciation was allowed for during the first two years for the additional machines in u e* He considered that the hir Ministry must take account of depreciation during this period as a normal busineos inea.sure. Compensation might for accounting purposes be paid under another head of the subsidy agreement, but actual wear and tear would ta^e place on the Persian Gulf route. THE CHAIRMAN stated that it appeared that the estimated expenditure would be as follows:- An initial recurring a pi tail coat of £1V,CC0 £20,0 ^ o * cash expenditure for the first twoS' years of f15,000 - f17,COO per annun on ope ratine-; charges. (c) An annual expenditure of about &lt;030,000 per annum in later years, including allowance for depreciation of extra machines. These figures were accepted by the Sub-Committee. SIR JOHN SIMON said that he had recently had a conversation with Teymourtache, the Persian Minister of Court, on this question. In his view we had no effective means of compelling the Persian Government to extend Imperial Airways present concession to fly over their territory, and to pursue negotiations in the absence of any alternative y/ould be to invite a rebuff. He considered it probable that as soon as the Persians realised that we were independent of them, they would prove more accommodating. So long as we could not show clearly that we were prepared to adopt an alternative route, the Persians were in a strong position and could really blackmail us. He therefore felt strongly that it was essential to press on with the preparation of the alternative Arabian route. It had been suggested that negotiations should be pursued in London. He regarded this suggestion as objectionable in principle. If we did not deal with the Persians through our Minister in Tehran, our Minister would lose all his authority. He had informed Teymourtache that if the Persian Government should refuse to allow this international air route to continue and not renew the present permission His Majesty’s Government would have to consider M other measures”. It was for consideration whether the time had not now come to be more precise and telj the Persians that we were definitely arranging to adopt the / -3-J &amp;(3 kv&amp;b ian route on the expiration of the present concession if it were not renewed,, THE iu^RQUESS OP LOKHOfDHhRx ashed whether the Persian Government had shewn any discriiaination in favour of the Prench or Dutch air lines now operating along the route. He wished to Know what would he the position as regards these lines if our permission were discontinued. Would they not make ocher arrangements to continue their services, to which it was known t he at-bach considerable importance? lit, REilDSL explained that the piench and Dutch concessions, although they had been renewed, were now due to expire simultaneously ’with ours at tue enc. 01 Parch next. There was no definite information as to the intentions of the wrench and butcn, du.o Cii© ^oi oi 0 n Office considered it probable that if the South Persian route were closed to Imperial airways, it would be equally closed to the French and Dutch, and that the x-rencn and Dutch would probably accept the situation. THD CHAIRiIAlT then referred to the point raised m paragraph 3 of the Air Ministry's I'etaoranduu to the effect that should the air service between Basra and Karachi be allowed to lapse, His Majesty's Government would incur a commitment of some .330,000 per annum for the next seven years, as compensation to Imperial Airways under the terns of the existing contract. Should this be correct, it would appear that the cost ox conxinuia- suspending the service would be the same in either case. SIR Slffl-OTTO IwnJESOTHSB produced a copy of the contract for inspectionajim (2^ SIR JOILI SII.10N thought that it appeared evident .from the Contract that the Government was liable for c omp en s a L a. on lox direct j. os &amp; $ buc noc for loss of 'oi’ofit* SIR SIGMUND DAI'INR-IUxirMR replied that only a small profit had hitherto been made by Imperial Airways. MAJOR ILL I Of considered that it might be more economical to suspend the Basra-Karachi service temporarily and pay compensation rather than take a hasty decision involving undefined expenditure and liabilities on the hypothesis that no deal could be made with the Persians, INI Cl AIRMAN stated chat it was obvious thar the liability for compensation did exist and would have to be borne in mind.

SIR BOLTON EYRSS-MOHSDLL said that while the Admiralty would co-operate in any defence measures required, it was very difficult for ships to defend a shore establishment. The best solution, he considered, would be for Henjam to be adopted as an alternative rest stage, which, being an island, could easily be defended by the Navy. TIE CHAIRMAN stated that the foreign Office had already ruled out this proposition on the grounds that a continuance of the existing air route would be more acceptable to Persian amour orop re than the retention of Henjam. I.IAJOR LLLIOT considered that it might be worth our while to pay a substantial rent for the permanent lease of Henjam. HR.

He asked whether* in the event of the he si dent in the Persian and the fir Officer Commanding in Iraq being satisfie Gulf d as to the security of the proposed nest house, the other Services would withdraw their obJecticns« LORD HAILSH/Ju agreed. He had voiced his obiecti- ns in order that it might be recorded that the War Office could not accept responsibility. SIR SIGilUND DA NHREUTHHR in reply to a question by Lord Hailsham, stated that as the rest houses and other ground equipment which had been established by Imperial Airways on Persian territory would necessarily be evacuated, the Government would have t assume liability for those required along the alternative route. LORD HAlLSHiU expressed the view that fr m a brief perusal of the Imperial Pirways Contract it did not appear that the Govemrimt was resp .nsible for such a charge under the 'force na;jeur ,, clause. THE CHAIRMAN stated that until further information bee.mes available it would be impossible to begin the erecti n of any rest house. The immediate despatch of an officer by Imperial A.irways to make a complete and detailed survey met with the general agreement of the meeting, and the Foreign Secretary would then ae in a position 'go inform the Persians that an alternative mute was being prepared. Cn receipt of this Officer s report and further inf o.rmati on fr m the Resident xn the Persian Gulf, the question of erecting a rest house could be discussed by the departments concerned* and, should agree ment be reached, measures should be put in hand for its immediate erection.SIR J0HI7 SIIICN reverted to the question whether it would not new he desirable t© tell the .Persians plainly that His iialesty* s Qcvemuent were greatly disappointed at their attitude and had now definitely authorised the necessary steps for t he establishment of an alternative route along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf which would -omit Persian territory altogether. LORD HAlLSHlM considered that it would be preferable so far as possible to leave the Persians in doubt as tc our precise intentions. This might make it more difficult for then to call cur bluff, and would in any case be preferable in vievf of the uncertainties which still existed in regard to the Arabian route - &gt; ^ xe doubtful attitude of the Sheiks revealed in the latest telegrams from the Political Resident, defence difficulties expense, etc. It Wt-s agreed that in these circumstances it would he tetter not to he too precise tc the Persians at this stage regarding the actual measures which we were taming to establish the Arabian route. In reply to a question HE. S3NS3L explained that the position on the Arabian coast was somewhat peculiar as we had treaties with the various rulers concerned which gave us a definitely predominant position. 'e should be under no • legal obligation to extend permission t^ the French ana Butch to use the Arabian route used by British aircraft though it might be desirable to do so on grounds of policy.SIR JOHN SIMON stated that a 'Delegram dated December 15th had new be n received Iron cur Minister at Tehran (but not yez circulated tw other Departments) &lt;, showing that the position was a little more hopeful as the Persians -now seemed prepared to deal with the question the air route apart from the general negotiations and in return for some quid pro quo such as the re-opening of the Duzdap railway. He did not regard this develop ment as justifying any relaxation in our efforts to establish an alternative route ? since he felt that it was only Toy establishing such an alternative that we should be able to deal satisfactorily with the Persians. But at the same time he considered that no opening should be neglected to attempt to negotiate a settlement v/ith the Persian Government should one be possible. He understood, however, that the question of the Duzdap Railway was one falling mainly v/ithin the sphere of the India Office.. MR. V/AKELY said that the India Office and Government of India had already agreed to offer both the re-opening of the Railway, and if necessary its permanent transfer, t^ the Persians if we could thereby secure the continuance cf the South Persian air route. There would therefore be no difficulty about renewing this offer. The India Office w^uld however like to see drafts ^f any instructions sena to Mr. Hoare on the subject. SIR JOHN SIMON then suggested that if any negotia tions for a bargain over the continuance of the air route were to be entered into with the Persians, it should be made clear that the air route must pemain ©pen so long as the negotiations were in progress.I -11- It v.rs c.;ro3d this point oa-ht to he safeg^aarded. SIR JOHN BILION then suggested that Mr, Hoare should he instructed in reply to his telegram of December 15th to take up with the Persian Government the suggestion of linking up the Duzdap Railway with the continuance of the trans-Persian service 'on the understanding that both sides will pursue both matters concurrently and actively and that the temporary extension of the concession shoild be agreed to in the meantime''. CONCLUSIONS. IV THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To accept an estimate of probable expenditure involved in the establishment of an air route along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf as follows (i) An initial cauital cost of £17,000 - £00,000. (ii) a recurring cash expenditure for the first two years of £15,000 - £17,000 per annum on operating charges, (iii) In later years an annual expen diture of from £25,000 - £30,000 per annum, including allowance for extra obsolescence. (if the section Basra to Ilarachi is closed to Imperial Airways, the net compensation payable might amount to £30,000 per annum;. (b) That the Air Ministry should be authorised to sanction the despatch by Imperial Airways of an officer to make a complete and detailed survey of a civil air route along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. ( c) That as regards the proposal of the Air Ministry for the erection of a rest house etc. - (i) Nothing shotid be done until further information is received from the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq.10 , (c) (ii) f'n receipt of such inf ormation the Air Ministry should consult the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury and the India Office, and when inter-departmental agreement has been reached immediate measures for the construction of a rest house should be put in hand* I IV .ArROCL':DUR.U, C!!5 Cu 4.1011 cipe u ■-&lt;. v cont,ion ‘co o. nope on cpocGdvpe tnat haa c oen Prepared d/ I r.

The view of my Secretary of State is that in its political aspects the whole question has already been settled, and it is, therefore, only a question of the financial points raised by Capt. Walter Elliot s Memorandum M.E.(M) 10. Yours sincerely, M.J. Clauson, Esq., INDIA OFFICE, S.W.l.(THIS DOCtfrBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BAITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERI^iEMT) , ^ Honeographed for the Committee of Imperial Defence, December, SECRET* M.E*(lvl) 11 • STANDING MINISTERIAL SUB^COIMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE MIDDLE EAST. 1931. Copy No. EASTERN AIR ROUTE . Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air. 1 . Since the last meeting of the Sub-Committee at which the question of the Eastern Air Route was discussed, a memorandum (M.E.(M)lO) by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, dated 10th December, has been circulated. This memorandum is necessarily a bare outline and may, I fear, unintentionally have a somewhat misleading effect, unless it is supplemented by some further observations which I will endeavour to make as short as the somewhat complex issues permit. £• Firstly, I think too gloony a picture is painted of the probable expense. The figures quoted, based on a request by the Treasury for outside maximum figures, are in the opinion of my advisers and of the Managing Director of Imperial Airways, not likely to be reached. On the capital side the probable maximum cost may be put at £17,000, or at £12,000 if the main item, a rest-house, is, as has been suggested by the Poliii cal Resident, built by a local Sheikh and leased to Imperial Airways. Here I should like to interpolate, in the light of further investigations, a definite recommendation that tho Resident should be instructed to negotiate on a basis of a rest -house rather than a rest -vessel . Evidence is accumulating that a rest-house would bo more convenient and safer, whilst it would undoubtedly be cheaper. As to recurrent costs (apart from any subsidy to the Sheikh - for the payment of which approval has already been given in principle), these will probably not exceed £15,000. The question of extra obsolescence on the two additional machines involved in a mixed land-plane and flying-boat route (perhaps £12,000 per annum) does not arise for at lea st two years , and only then if, when the boats it is intended to divert to this service become obsolete, a land-plane service is still impossible. 3. Furthermore, my colleagues should be made aware of an important point that is not referred to in the Financial Secretary's memorandum. If Imperial Airways are not allowed to fly over the Basra-Karachi section of the Indian Route, the 'force majeure* clause of their Agreement, which runs to 1939, will come into operation and entitle the Company to compensation for all direct loss (excluding loss of profit) sustained by them. Judging by past experience when an earlier service terminated at Basra, there would be practically no mail and no passengers for India by the Air Service, and the compensation payable to Imperial Airways during the period of interruption of flying between Basra and Karachi might, it is estimated, involve a net charge on the Exchequer of £30,0 per annum, or possibly more, after allowing for the non-payment of the subsidy (£38,500 per annum) allocated to that section of the India Route. 4. The use of a sea link between Basra and Karachi is, therefore, I suggest financially impracticable. I need hardly emphasise how damaging a blow would be struck at 'British prestige in the Middle East, if we were forced to resort to sea carriage in the Gulf by. Persian intransigence coupled with fears as to the attitude of an isolated^petty sheikh on the Arabian coast. Local native opinion would be under no illusion as to the motive causes underlying our abandonment ol the use of aircraft on this section. I would again, in this connection, remind my colleagues that this is the key trunk air route of the Empire, which will sooner The Resident has reported that the attitude of the Sheikh of but not altogether satisfactory) alternative is very iriendly Dibai (a possible and helpful .2 ^ later carry the Australian as well as the Indian air mail. I may add that already no less than 4^- million letters are being conveyed annually by the existing Indian service. 5 . Naturally I should be delighted if it were possible to induce Persia to extend the permit to use the Persian coast route, but the Foreign Office have repeatedly advised that this is not practical politics, and accordingly ur^-ed upon us transference to the Arabian coast. I must, moreover, enter a caveat against the suggestion that the inducement might take the form of a ’’substantial' rent, if by that is meant a payment out of all proportion to the charges normally ruling in the cas$ of Powers who are members of the I.C.A.N., and therefore partaking of the nature of blackmail. The facts would soon be known, and other Powers - petty or greet - might seek similarly to blackmail us; and, apart from grave reactions on our prestige, the future for international civil aviation would be black indeed. Our prime object, viz. to work towards the establishment of civil air transport on a commercial basis, would be frustrated; and the Exchequer would in all probability be faced before long with a far heavier expenditure than anything involved in the Arabian Coast route. 6. Finally I would recall to my colleagues the strategic importance of an air route following the Arabian coast, a route already in existence in embryo and one that must be developed and maintained even if the Civil air route remains on, or reverts to, t he Pers ia n 'coast. It follows, therefore, that any expenditure on the ArabiarTroute, even if Persia Yfere ultimately to acquiesce in the continua tion of the use of the Persian coast route by Imperial Airways, will not be wasted, or of a nugatory nature - quite the reverse. For instance, a rest-house at Ras-al-Khaimah, or in the vicinity, is clearly a future, if not an immediate, requirement of the Royal .Air Force. In this connection I may point out that, even if coma other arrangorrent were made with Persia and, as has been suggested. Hen jam became available, that might possibly serve Imperial Airways' immediate purpose 7.*ell enough, though the financial saving as compared with using the Arabian Coast would be of the smallest, since the greater cost of having to use flying-boats for part of the route instead of using larAplanes throughout between Egypt or Palestine and India would remain. The strategic route, however, must be one that is organised for use by lan&amp;q)lanes as well as seaplanes and in order to avoid infringing Persian neutrality, can therefore only follow the Arabian Coast. 7. Discussion on this matter has been so protracted and action so long delayed that I cannot but concur in ifce Financial Secretary r s view that no substitute route can be adequately planned so as to be in final readiness by 1st April, 193^; but even if Persia remains intransigent and insists on the abandonment of the Persian coast route, I do not think it unreasonable to expect that, if we are already at ^ work organising the Arabian route, Persia may be prepared to allow us (say) 6 months grace in which to complete our preparations. Even so, it will be neceosary to proceed with the utmost expedition, and in my view the Air Ministry should be authorised to incur expenditure, if and as soon as the Political Resident can arrange satisfactory terms with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah or some other sheikh (a) on preliminary survey (e.g. by Imperial Airways, who have an olficer ready to go out and make all necessary preparations), and (b) on such items of capital expenditure as require a long time for execution, e.g. the rest-house, the cost of which is difficult to estimate, but should certainly not exceed £5,000 or £6,000, and a m^rin., base at Karachi. I would again emphasise that whatever happens, this expenditure will not be nugatory, but will be of direct utility to the military route which the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet have accepted as a vital strategic necessity. r Ministry, comber 16th, 1931. (intd.) L.The Departments concerned eref I suppos^the Treasury and the Air Ministry; the estimates quoted would be presumably for compensation and additional subsidy to Imperial Airways etc. The India Office naturally has not been brought into these discussions. The matter was referred to by Lord Londonderry at the Ministerial^ommittee’s meeting of 17th November. L It is understood that a further meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Committee is being held ao 11»30 to-morrow the 17th December to consider Major Elliot's memorandum and a reply which is being prepared by the Air Ministry• The position in regard to the selection oi a station for a night-stop on the Arab coast is as follows: The Secretary of State's telegram of 28 November authorised Colonel Biscoe to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimaii and TJmm-al-Qaiwain (these being the two places thought to ce suitable iron a. flying point of view). A further telegram of 3rd December authorised him to include ohe Snel^a Oj. LioCai in his negotiations if the creek at that place was iound suitable. Colonel Biscoe's telegrams of 6th and 7th December reported t'hsft after an exhaustive examination the/the Air Officer Coramanding consideredjDebai feasible, Has-al-Khaimah a good deal better and Umm-al-Qaiwain definitely ^suitable from a flying point of view; Colonel Biscoe had sounded Has -al -Khaimah who had asked for two days to discuss the matter with his relatives ,8110 Debai, with whom he thought there should be no great difficulty in arriving at a satis factory agreement. Colonel Biscoe thought that we should concentrate on obtaining ari agreement at Has -al -Khaimah if possibly and / if the Sheikh of that place proved entirely unyielding^fall back on Debai. The latest telegram of 12th December reports that the Sheikh of Has-al-Khaimah refuses to accept any responsibility (though he says that if Government like to establish a station neither he nor his people would interfere). Colonel Biscoe will return to one Trucial coast at the end of this week and meanwhile has left the Hesidency Agent to continue conversations with Has-al-Khaimah; there is just a chance that the latter’s people may bring pressure to bear on one Sheikh to consent to an agreement. Unlessjthe Sheikh of Has-al-Khaimah enters into an agreement by which he assumes responsibility the/(3 the risk of establishing a station at that place will clearly be very great unless we take steps for its permanent protection, which would naturally be more expensive than a subsidy to the Sheikh. It thus at present seems likely that the choice will lie between what is the best place from a flying point of view but far inferior in respect of safety and economy, and the second best from a flying point of view out without these disadvantages. /wn C H E T . 10 o COPY NO, COifillT TBS OF D 3FENG E STAHDING MINISTERIAL SUB-COxfciITTEB FOR QUESTTOUS CONCESNING THE MIDDLE EAST.

He has sounded Ras-al Khaimah (who asked for 2 days to discuss the matter with his relations) and Dibai (who was friendly and helpful) and is now going back to Ras-al Khaimah. Umm al Qawain is technically unsuitable, Dibai feasible, but Ras-al Khaimah better from the technical point of view. As regards the rest house on shore, if this is decided on, the Air Ministry agree that there would be no objection to the course suggested at the end of the telegram of 7th December. The Government of India*s telegram at P-.Z.7502/31 is in reply to the Secretary of State 1 s telegram at P.Z.7017&gt;£/ (flagged A ). In their opinion there would be a danger of unfavourable reaction; in India (they said 'among Indian Moslems' before) if troops from the Indian Army were employed to protect the establishment on the Trucial Coast, and also (though possibly less so) even if Suropean troops from the army in India were so employed. But the Government of India do not directly answer the Secretary of State*s particular enquiry whether there would be this danger even if such European troops were temporarily borrowed to cope with a sudden emergency; one might certainly assume that they mean the answer to be 'Yes' , were it not that their reference to 'garrison' in the last sentence of th.4*#ftelegram seems to be beside the particular point that was put to them. ■■ *j, n •ii u ?.■ r (19 groups) J Jj.Jg-iLI„P ,H £ R OP _J.

There should be no great difficulty in arriving at satisfactory agreement with him, and this fact will facilitate discussion with Raselkhaimah, where I am now proceeding. In both oases when mention was made of the eventual possibility of a house on the shore, Sheikh asked that they should build the house themselves according to our requirements and we should pay (? rent). They object to house actually belonging to the British Government being built in their territory, I presume that there would be no objection (COPIES Secretary of State for IndiaFiWCH.

W.l. 14th July 1931c Dear Bertram, With reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, I v/rite to say that Colonel Biscoe, to whom we sent a note of the proceedings at the conference on 3th July about the Persian air route, v/rites privately to suggest consideration of Khassab as an alternative to has al IChaima. You will remember that hen del referred to the possibility of using Khassab in the coure of the discussion, but that I was then inclined to think that,climatic conditions apart, difficulties would be likely to arise owing to the slender degree of authority exercised in that region by the Sultan of Muscat. The hesident says: Admittedly it is not as satisfactory as a creek that is entirely landlocked and calm in any weather. On the other hana, it is definitely a very sheltered bay, and there is not only the actual bay of Khassab itself but a couple of little bays on the west. It is open to the north, but I doubt if you would ever get much of a sea inside. I see Woods Humphery spoke of the possibility of a refuelling point off Has-al-IQiaimah. Khassab would be infinitely more protected than this, and as a matter of fact . . with a north-westerly gale blowing a flying boat could not land off kas-al-Khaimah, but would be quite protected off Khassab. There would be no political objections, since Khassab belongs to Muscat, and all that would be necessary would be to have a. . detachment of the Muscat Levy Corps for whom H.M.G. or Airways might reasonably pay. I suggest that you should sound the Air Ministry about this and anyway before the matter goes to the Cabinet put it up as an alternative that should be explored • aj.^ertram .^sq., J_j. , CBn. Aia MI IT I STAY. furtherfurther and adopted if possible, in view of the very serious objections to the Trucial Coast. Vie are telegraphing to the Government of India on 1iie question generally, with a view to clearing the ground before consideration by the Cabinet. We are telling them that Biscoe has suggested consideration of IChassab, tnat this is oeing examined, and that we will let them know the result as soon as possible. Would you be so hind as to let me hnow as soon as you conveniently can what the Air Hinistry and Imperial Airways would think out it? The political complications involved in the use of the Trucial Coast are so substantial that we think this alternative is one which should be very seriously considered. The expense involved is not likely ro be greater than would probably be necessary on the Trucial Coast; the political situation would be definitely much easier since protection could be afforded by Muscat levies, and it would not oe necessary to despatch British or Indian troops, while if it was necessary to make a display of naval or other force, the difficulties of doing so would be less since we should be acting with the approval and on the behalf of the legitimate sovereign. Finally we should have the great advantage of having our refuelling point or resthouse on the territory of a friendly ruler who has in the past been extremely anxious to co-operate with us in matters such as this, I am sending a copy of this letter to hendel.

W.C.2. 2 nd December, 1931. Reference our conversation on the telephone about the cipher telegram from Biscoe which you sent over. We have had a similar enquiry from A.0.0., Iraq, and our reply to him is to the effect that neither we nor Civil Aviation have objections to Debai provided that, in his opinion, it is operationally suitable, bearing in mind the type of boats Imperial Airways will be using and also if, in his and Biscoe's opinions,pother facilities required could be afforded and the security offered is at least equal to that likely at Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-^aiwain. We are also drawing A.O.C's attention to the earlier experiences of H.M. forces at Debai, notably the of a party of British seamen before the war and the more recent truculent and unfriendly attitude adopted by the Sheikh to our aircraft on visits in March 1930 and again in January 1931.

'e understand from the Air Ministry that they and Imperial Mnrays see no objection to Biscoe negotiating with the fheikh of Debai as well as with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Uinn-al-Qawain, provided that the Air Officer Camnending is satisfied that the facilities for operating aircraft and for defence, etc., are no worse at Debai than at the other places. I hope you will agree that there is no objection to Biscoe including Debai in the scope of his negotiations. Indeed, there is probably one important reason why Debai would be preferable to either Ras-al- Khairaah or Ilm-al-^awain, viz .. that the Sheikh of /&gt;V 'it Debai is the most influential and intelligent, as Biscoe says, and has been helpful in the past, i ou may rerrimber/ •^?T&gt;?V55 in c ;hffin ‘* T '* ? *°*.

The incident of an affront offered to some men of the British India Sterna navigation Compan;. ’e Agent t which the letter referred was satisfactorily f settled owing to the good offices of the fheikh. He ^ was also of some assistance to us last year at Ras-al- Khaimah. It is quite probable, therefore, that we should be on firmer ground if we had an agreement with the Sheikh of Debai than we should he at either of the other place** What we would propose to do is to telegrapn to Biscoe informing Mm that, if Debai creek is found suitable, he may include the Sheikh of that place in his negotiations, and that his endeavour should be t ascertain/ 7ascertain at which of the three places concerned there is the best prospect of obtaining a really satisfactory agreement* and that he should then report* of courfie without cormnitting himself to aiy of X think this rather falls in with the Admiralty view, which has always been that other alternatives besides Ras-al-I'Chairr ah and ’\1 *i&amp;wain ought to be explored* (Sgd.)

I have discussed the question of the air route with the Air officer Commanding. We are examining Dibai creek tomorrow and he considers there is likelihood that it will be found suitable.

The draft submitted on 21 November was shown demi-officially to Mr. Hendeli of the Foreign Office at his request on 24 November, and he suggested the two small alterations shewn in pencil thereon. These i may be accapted. On the same day I heard from Mr. Bertram, Deputy Director of Civil Aviation, that the Air Ministry would like to see the draft. It appears that subsequently to the decision of the Ministerial Committee on 17 November, the Air Ministry ; had a meeting with Imperial Airways at which the superiority, for various reasons, of a rest house on shore over a rest vessel was pointed out. The Air I Ministry accordingly suggested an additional paragraph (marked A in the Air Ministry minute of 25 November attached) which varies the statement of requisite facilities contained in paragraph 4 of the Secretary of State’s telegram of 16 October (flagged in the file below). The Air Ministry discussed this demi-officially ! with the Admiralty but the latter objeciwto its inclusion! and also to an alternative draft which was subsequently discussed, as constituting a gloss on the decision of the Ministerial Committee. Finally the Admiralty agreed to the insertion of the words shown : in the margin on the second page of the draft whicn is 1 now submitted. the Sheikhs consent to a rest house on shore instead of opportunity of seeking the facilities now consioeren The effect of this is that the instructions as to the facilities to be aimed at stand; but if Colonel Biscoe finis that it may be possible to obtain a rest vessel in the creek, he will doubtless ^takey^ne 4401a 5000 5/30 preferable/c- &gt; &gt;r . •,.■•&gt; ••'• ■&gt; \ Vs... - '■ •-••^V '•■•* m'vV preferablV'of course probable ■that the Sheikh ^ ma ke more objection to an.establishment on shore; but in any case the addition to the draft trill indicate to Colonel Biscoe that the possibility of a subsequent, change from the creek to the shore should not be ^eluded by any engagements given to the Sheikh Ls'.n ..v.

Possible establishment of a Monarchy by the French in Syria and future policy thereon. 1. bASTSPIT A1P POUTKo THE iiARQUSSS OF LOhPOFbhRPY said that in view of the impending closure of the dr route along the Persian coast 5 immediate sbeps were essential in order to establish an alternative route and thus maintain the existing air service to India. Various proposals had been explored 3 the only feasible one c, in the eyes of the Air Ministry* being to establish a flying boat service from Basra to G-wadar via Bahrein and Pas al Khaimah. This would entail a vessel* for use as a i est boat* being moored in the lagoon at Pas al Khaiman* where machines and their passengers would have to stay the night. The main point with which the Air Ministry was concerned was that this service must be continued. They did not regard the dangers involved as so serious as to render the alternative now proposed impracticable. SIR BOLTON LYRES-MOPSLLL said that while agreed that the air route should be continued* the Admiralt they con sidered that all other alternatives had not been fully explored. he suggested that the use of Henjam as a rest station* in lieu of Ras al Khaimah * should be considered. This island was preferable to Ras al Khaimah* both for climatic and strategic reasons* as well as having a better— vt; tor supply’ if tbs present objections to tbe continuance of cur occupation of Kenjsan as a naval depot could be overcome the Admiralty v,ould ask the Air Ministry whether this island would rot be equally convenient as a rest station on the Sas'cern air route in lieu of Ras al Khaimah- The Admiralty have had under careful consideration the possible alternative naval bases and in view of the high coot, some £35,000 to £40,000, of removing to Bahrein and the inferiority of this place os a base, they consi der that the possibility of remaining at Henjam should be care fully reconsidered, and they will shortly raise this question with the other Departments concerned. He considered that a rest vessel, moored in the lagoon at Kas al Khainah, would be exposed to risk and would be very difficult to defend, as owing to the shallow depth of water off the shore His Majesty's ships have to lie at about 1* miles from the lagoon. Consequently some landing force would be necessary for its defence in the event of trouble. , of rearranging the He would like to suggest that &gt;he po.biDiiiwj • i a.

This appeared to he one of their main reasons for refusing to allow us to continue to use the South Persian air route, and applied with even greater force to our position at fenjan. The reasons which made it necessary to Seof an alternative to the South Persian air route equally ruled out any question of utilising Henjam. TH3 CilAIRIlAh considered that from a general point of view the establishment of a route along the Arabian shore was desirable on diplomatic grounds. He had found from recent experience that the Persians were getting more and more recalcitrant in their dealings with us. MR. WAlvELY said that the Government of India preferred the existing Persian route and had always regarded the Arabian route as a ,r pis aller”. MR. RENDEL explained that the Foreign Office did not wifch definitely and finally to exclude all possibility of an arrangement being come to with the Persians for the continued use of the South Persian route. Such an arrangement might still be arrived at, and in a recent interview with Sir Robert Vansittart, the Persian Minister of Court had hinted that Persia might agree to thecontinuance of the route if a sufficiently high price were paid; but in his previous inter view with Sir John Simon, Teymourtache, the Minister of Court, had not shown any signs of weakening on this question, and the Foreign Office definitely could not guarantee that the route would remain open after next March. They considered that we could not continue to gamble on such a possibility, and that, unless we were prepared to face the interruption of the Air Service to India, an alternative route should therefore be prepared without further delay. THE CHAIRMAN agreed and stated that an alternative route must be found. In view of the new service having to function by the 1st April next, immediate measures were/necessary. If there was any further delay an interrup tion of the service to India was inevitable. SIR JOhf BALII01ID agreed and considered that if a decision was now taken it would he practicable to establish an air rouwe via has al Khaiiaah by the end of March next. fi-M IhfRQUrSo OP LOIu)CMDLHHY recognised that the protection of the proposed rest station at Ras al Khaimah would De difficult. lie considered^ however &gt; that the danger could be adequately provided for were an armed guard made available for the immediate defence of the rest V63 s el• BIR JOHN nyres-Monsell ? the possibility eiJjMOND c, in reply to a question by Sir Bolton stated that the Air Ministry had considered oi substituting a stoamer do me linn for the air service between Bahrein and G-wadar. Though this would entail a delay of only six hours it had been found impracticable on commercial grounds. MAI OR ELLIOT stated what the Treasury 'were not yet satisfied as to the ultimate expenditure that would be involved in the establishment of the new route. for purposes of comparison it was not sufficient merely to t ake the figures given. There was a serious element of risk* and if that risk were to be taken into account the potential cost of the Ras al Khaimah air route might prove much greater even than that of an uneconomic - but safe - steamer service. He recognised the desirability for the air route to continue but wished to remind the Sub-Committee that the liability involved^ which was indeterminate* might prove financially impracticable and eventually lead to the abandonment of an air service over this section of the route.liile the Treasury v/ished to raise no objection to the opening of negotiations, they would lihe further informa tion as the cost that would he involved, hoth as regards any recurring expenditure, such as subsidies, as well as any immediate capital payments to Imperial hirways« He therefore wished to enter a caveat that the Treasury could net agree to the establishment of this new air route until more information is forthcoming as to the estimated cost 9 He thought it important that we should not definitely oommit I ourselves at this stage 0 LIT• KSFDIILi observed that the Official Sub-Committee, in framing their recommendations for the initiation of negotia tions, had kept this point in vic T .v. They had allowed for an opportunity for re-consideration when the attitude of the Sheikh should have been ascertained, by suggesting that any agreement reached should be subject to the approval of His majesty : s Government, so that I..is Majesty’s Govermaent might not find themselves prematurely committed should some other alternative, after all, prove practicable, or should some unexpected difficulty arise 0 TK3 K/lRQUSSS OH LOiTDOI-TLilERY, in reply to a question by the Chairman, stated that the Air Ministry anticipated that an immediate expenditure of 010,000 would be incurred in the establishment of this air route 0 As the reasons 01 tno transfer of the route from the Persian to the Arabian snore ..ere of a political nature, compensation would have to oe paid to Imperial Airways, who had incurred expenditure in the erection 01 buildings ; , etc., along the Persian coast and would have to incur fresh expenditure for facilities along the Araoian coast 0 A further £10,000 would be required to operate a sea-plant- service along the/-6 Arabian coast„ Until the details had been settled (with (J Imperial Airways) he could not be more precise as to the recurring or ncjn-recurring cost,, TEE CIlrJrmlnN suggested that the Committee should authorise the air Ministry to make the necessary provisional arrangements with Imperial Airways for the institution of the proposed sea-plane service, after consulting with the Treasury as regards the cost thereof* The question as to whether financial or strategic considerations would render the' stablishment of this service impracticable could then be considered separately. It was necessary to authorise the initiation of negotiations with the local Sheikh concerned, in order to obtain the facts on which a decision on this question 1 could be arrived at* MAJOR ELLIOT asked for the assistance of the Admiralty in the preparation of such estimates. It was agreed that the Board of Trade would be in a better position to estimate the cost of any sea-borne link. CONCLUSION^ tee MINISTERIAL SUE-COMMITTEE agreed:- (a) That the Tolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf authorised immediately to open negotiations with the Arab rulers concerned and to endeavour to secui^e an agreement, to be subject to the approval of His Majesty T s Government, with one of them, whereby in return for a payment not exceeding £2.000 a year, he and his tiibesmsi would pro vide ^ Imperial Airways with the necessary facilities and guarantees ? and (b) That the .air Ministry be invited - (i) to consider, in conjunction T/ith the Treasury and the Board of Trade, the financial liability likely to be incurred by His Majesty s Government in the institution of a service of flying boats from Basra to Gwadar or Karachi via the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, or alternatively of a s.u-i-ppir.g service between Bahrein and Gwadar 0(ii; SuD^ect to Treasury sanction 'being °otdined to naue tue necessary provisional arrangonents with Imperial ..irways for the institution of such c ’' °oi'vice to be really to begin operations at the end of Liar oh 5 193b. 2.

Many thanks for your confidential demi- official letter of 3rd November,No,728-S, I will let the Air Ministry know of the point about the danger of marauding Bedouin. I am glad to say that we have at last got approval of the £3,000 a year limit of expenditure under such agreement as you may be able to secure. The whole question of the air route had to be considered by the Official Middle East Committee, and then by the Ministerial Committee. The latter have passed a recommendation - T That the Political Resident in the Persian ^ Gulf be authorised immediately to open negotiations with the ^.rab rulers concerned and to endeavour to secure an agreement,to be subject to the approval of His Majesty T s Government, with one of them, whereby in return for a payment not exceeding £3,000 a year he and his tribesmen will provide Imperial Airways with the necessary facilities and guarantees. 1 WeWe have more than once pressed home the points which you made in London and mention in the last paragraph of your letter as to the factors which mahe it difficult to obtain the desired agreement, and suggested the desirability of reasonably generous expenditure. At the same time, we stated that you would, of course, manage as economically as possible. Subject to what you thin!:, there seems to be a good deal in the Government of India T s suggestions that the money to be paid out should be paid for (real or assumed) value to be received under specified heads - e*g«&gt; so much for the rent of the lagoon; so much for the payment of guards, and perhaps officers. The Air Ministry and Treasury have made the further suggestion explained in a letter from Bertram of 6th Hovember of wnich I enclose a copy, the part of the subsidy should talie the form of landing fees paid separately on each separate visit of an aircraft. This suggestion, which prima facie we agreed here seemed a good one, might conceivably involve the fixation of some maximum annual limit of the number of visits, unless the landing fee was quite a small one;J&amp;) one; t&gt;nt I daresay there will he no difficulty in this connection; we shall see how things pan out when it comes to drafting the agreement. The only point to hear in mind is that the limit of annual expenditure in all cannot he exceeded: hut I daresay there is a prospect that it will not even he approached. The effect of the Ministerial Committee 1 s decision is that you are given a free hand to negotiate and reach the basis of an agreement (if possible) and actually draw up the heads of an agreement; at this stage, however, at the latest - and probably earlier - you would naturally report what measure of success was at ending your negotiations and whether there was a prospect of reaching a satisfactory agreement - satisfactory in the sense that it promised a fair measure of security for the protection of the establishment, so far as this depends on the Sheikh and his tribesmen. The agreement of course would be with His Majesty 1 s Government (in the United kingdom) not with Imperial Airways.Confidential. fly At'g MnjL D.U.

J^Z.SbVO/Sl of the 23rd October 1931, regarding the air route. i enclose for your information an extract from a letter of proceedings received from the senior naval Officer, which has a direct bearing on the question of the subsidy. iou will see from it that the sedouin in the interior have been harassing the xrucial shaikhs. xhis of course is nothing naw, and these gentry usually levy blackmail to a lesser or greater extent on the inhabitants of the coast. .During the past summer, however* the attacks seemed to have been more numerous than formerly, possibly because the xrucial shaikhs in their present im poverished condition are not in a position to buy them off so effectively as before. However this may be, it is clear that whether the imperial Airways halting ground is at Kas ai-Khaimah or umm-al-(|av/ain the shaikh who accepts responsibility for it will not only have to overcome the antagonism of his own tribesmen, but will also have u&gt; maintain C. Walton, Esq., C.S., M.C., India Office,maintain a considerable number of guards to protect the imperial Airways* barge against marauding uedouin, and, while i am not in a position to give any definite figure at present, 30 or 40 armed men will probably be required and they will have to be provided with arms and ammunition. You will see that it has been suggested in the Senior naval Officer*s note that representations on the subject of the activities of these ±jedouin mi^it be made to Xbn Saud. I think it would be unwise. ibn baud would probably jump at the opportunity of establishing his authority over these tribes and would probably send one or two officials, if not to the irucial Coast, to some place a few miles inland, and there would be every likelihood that these men would carry on constant intrigues with the xrucial Shaikhs and endeavour to extend their master *s authority over them. The shaikh of Kas ai-Khaimah is already reported to have appealed to Ibn baud for support against .British encroachments, and jl do not think we want to encourage closer relations between the ‘rrucial Shaikhs and the ruler of iNejd. As regards the sum which it may be necessary to pay as subsidy, as you know, in .London ± said that j. could not give any definite estimate until I had been down and gone into the matter, and 1 suggested that a maximum figure should be fixed and that i should endeavour to make the cheapest arrangement possible. i certainly have no intention of offering the maximum amount in the first instance, and i hope that it may be possible to obtain the necessary guarantee from the bhaikh concerned at a relatively moderate figure having regard to the importance of the object to be attained, namely the continuance ot the Arab Air Route to India. 1 did however point out (1; that therethere was a great deal of antagonism on the iruciai Coast to the establishment of a civil air route which could only be overcome if the inhabitants derived some daflnite advantage from it, (2; that these shaikhs were not autocratic rulers and that it was a question not only of obtaining the concurrence of the shaikh but of all his clan, ^3) that the alternative, namely, coercion, would be very much more expensive, and 14; that the shaikh would have to maintain armed guards, and at the conference neither the Secretary of state nor the Air Ministry representatives seemed to think that the figure suggested by me was in any way exorbitant, xhe subsidy the rtfoJfe will have to be a generous one, but i should like to emphasise that 1 will of course try and make the cheapest arrange ment I can. i am sending a copy of this u.O* to Howell.Extract from Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf*s Letter of Proceedings No. 42/587, dated 12th October 1931. 11. lianasir and f Awamjr Tribes - Bin Sana's alleged control of . (a) There is no doubt that the Manasir and •Awamir bedouins have given much trouble to the Trucial Shaikhs this year, and as shown above under the heading ’’Hamriyah”, they are not above offering their services to dissatisfied individuals who desire to interfere with the established political order in the respective Shaikhdoms. The Residency Agent was loud in his complaints to me of the depredations and interference of these undisciplined marauders. The whole of the Trucial Coast was suffering from them ana there was little or no security. (b) The Residency Agent asked me whether these tribes did not really owe allegiance to the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, and if so could not some action be taken to represent to him that the tribes 1 activities should be confined to their own territories. He stated too that the tribal chieftains paid tribute to the Amir of Hasa, who collected it on behalf of Bin Saud. Ail the tribute came originally from the loot captured from the Trucial Coast principalities. No secret was made of this and apparently the .Amir encouraged them to obtain more. I could not answer the question put to me nor could I accept the evidence as conclusively proving the case against Bin Saud, but I advised the Residency Agent that he should send a formal protest to the Political Resident, supported by the most reliable evidence he could obtain. Sheikh Muhammed took a keen interest in this part of the discussion. Prom what he said, and Isa^ approving comments, I gather that there is a def- -inite movement on foot amongst the Trucial Shaikhs to meet together to draw up a considered protest to be despatched by Isa to the Political Resident.

Those which they mentioned m the Official Sub-Committee were:- (a) a night stopping station at Abu Lhasa instead of on the Trucial Coast; (b) a long hop from Bahrein to Gwadar; (c) a sea-borne link from Basra to India. The Air Ministry replied to these suggestions that (a) has been considered and found unsuitable from the flying point of view; that (b) is not possible at present for nachines carrying a full commercial load; and that (c) is not practicable for financial reasons. To the objection to (c) it might be added that it would obviously be a retrograde step. The Admiralty did not at all press (c). The last sentence of para. 7 does not mean that the opening of negotiations should be postponed while alternatives are investigated, but the Admiralty irr ould perhaps feel happier if alternatives (a) and (b) were further investigated between them and the Air Ministry while the negotiations are in progress. Pare. 3 . The Admiralty's views may be summed up as follows (i) They doubt whether the negotiations will be successful. (ii) In the event of an agreement being successfully arrived at, the Admiralty pointy to the danger of sniping by disaffected followers of theSheikh or neighbouring tribesmen; (li i) the danger of an attack on a more serious scale by neighbouring tribesmen, to repel which (co far as the yavy is concerned) it would be necessary to land forces fro in (iv) the greater risk of complications i' foreign companies are allowed to use the station and their aircraft become involved in an incident. The answers to these points seem to be as 'ollojs:- (i'l There is no reason why we should not do our bes to obtain a satisfactory agreement. 1+ ‘ out- 1 far- fetched to suggest that the mere opening of negotiations for an agreement would have an unfavourable effect on tlje Sheikh or on the Trucial Coast Arabs generally.

Department. offered him for guarding the R.A.F. petrol barge. If during his conversation Isa gave the Sheikh to understand that no further concession would be demanded of him, this cannot affect the question of entering into fresh negotiations; we shall not be demanding further concessions but offering the Sheikh a fresh bargain by which, in return for facilities, etc., for Imperial Airways, he would receive a fresh subsidy (out of all proportion to that offered in respect of the R.A.^. barge). (ii) ^e hope to eliminate or at any greatly reduce the danger of casual hostile acts^ committed in Ras-al-Khaimah itself by means of an agreement with the Sheikh; under this agreement he would be responsible for preventing such acts, and as the Air Ministry suggest in para. 9, we should support his authority so long as he acted in good faith and endeavoured to keep order; moreover, the amount of the subsidy is specially calculated with a view to enabling the Sheikh to overcome the opposition of his people and keep the peace. (iii) This is one of the major defence questions which will no doubt have to be further discussed. (iv) The Admiralty objection assumes that it will be necessary to admit foreign aircraft when once we have obtained facilities for our own. Though the F.O. tend to take the view that it will be difficult to keep out foreigners, the question has not yet been decided in that sense and is obviously one which will have to be carefully considered/(■THIS T ',Q n ™^ T 15 THE ^P^ S gTY 0?

Proposed Establishment of Arabian Route in View of Impending Closure of Persian Section. Memorandum prepared by the Standing Official Sub-Committee. THE Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have held two meetings to consider this question, which has become one of great urgency. 2. It has become clear that there is now little or no hope of obtaining from the Persian Government an extension of the permission for the use by Imperial Airways of the existing route across Southern Persia. It was hoped last July that the desire of the Persian Government to secure the reopening of the Duzdab Railway might have furnished the means of striking a bargain with Persia by which an extension of the permit to use the South Persian route might be obtained. It now seems highly improbable that such a bargain can be concluded; and it is essential to face the fact that, in all probability, the feouth Persian air route will be definitely closed down at the end of March 1932. It is therefore of the utmost importance, if the air service to India is not to be interrupted, that an alternative route should be prepared with the least possinle delay. 3. In the opinion of the Foreign Office, moreover, the only hope of continuing negotiations with the Persian Government on this subject with tBe remotest chance of success lies in our having an alternative route to fall back on. So long as the Persians regard us as being entirely in their power in this matter, negotiations will be impossible. The preparation of an alternative route therefore, is necessary, not only in order that we may fall back on that route if and when the Persian route is finally closed, but as furnishing the onl) hope or perhaps, after all, obtaining an extension of the agreement for the use of t e Persian route by negotiation. 4. The Air Ministry, who have carefully studied the various alternative routes, consider that the only practicable alternative is a route from Basra to Gwadar (and Karachi), following the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. I m would necessitate the use of flying boats instead of land planes, and ^ou involve, in addition to a halt at Bahrein (which presents no difficulty), the development of a regular landing place and refuelling station at some point on the Trucial Coast, where passengers would have to spend the night- f h e Ai r Ministry consider that the only practicable points for this landing pl a ^ would be either the lagoon or creek at Ras-al-Khaimah, or that at Lmm-al-Qaiwam. in either of which a rest vessel and petrol supply barge could be moored. 1 1 om this point it would be possible to fly to Gwadar (which, though belonging to the Sultan of Muscat, is an enclave on the coast of India, and presents no difficulty), in a single flight outside Persian territorial waters. 5. The only really serious difficulty in connection with the development of this route lies in the uncertain attitude of the Trucial Sheikhs, on whose goodwill we shall depend in the first instance for the development of the landing and refuelling station between Bahrein and Gwadar, and subsequently for the safety of the personnel and passengers using the station. [6166] Copy No. 53fi The India Office hope that it may be possible to secure the necessary , a Guarantees from the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, or from the u rmm g al Oaiwain in return for a subsidy not exceeding £3,000 a year, ol the urgency of the matter, they are most anxious that the Political Resident ui the pfrsian Gulf should be authorised to open negotiations on this basts when he visits this area in the very near future. They hope that the basis, wnen ne subsidy could be arranged in such a way as not onlv^ toSe the acquiescence of the Sheikh concerned in the establishment of tk andhig and refuelling station in his lagoon or creek, but also so as to secure his co operation and that of his unruly subjects and potential rivals, m guaranteeing tL safe y of the installation The India Office and Air Ministry can suggest no other alternative, and are hopeful that this proposal will secure the necessary minimum of safety to render possible the continued operation of the air route to India' 11 The arrangements involved will take some months to complete and it is therefore of the utmost importance that a settlement should be reached More the end of the present year. Before, however, any negotiations even of a preliminary character can be opened with the rulers concerned, it is necessary to obtain Treasury sanction for the proposed subsidy. 7 The Admiralty, while not disputing the desirability of ensuring the continuance of the air route to India, regard the proposal of the India Office and Air Ministry as involving considerable risks and as liable to lead to commitments on a larger scale than the other Departments anticipate. They would have much preferred that the landing and refuelling station between Bahrein and Gwadar should either be eliminated or be situated on one of the islands m the Persian Gulf or at a point under more direct British control than eithei lias al-Rhaiman or Umm-al-Qaiwain. They would therefore urge that a further investigation should be made of the possible alternatives; but if, as the Air Ministry contend those alternatives should still prove entirely impracticable, they are anxious that the decision to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qaiwain should not be taken without a full realisation of the possible commitments and dangers involved. 8. In this connection the Admiralty point out that, when concluding the present agreement for the mooring of the R.A.F. barge, the sheikh oi Ras-al-Khaimah was given to understand by our Residency Agent (an Arab), m response to his specific enquiry, that no further concession would be demandea of him. It is possible, therefore, that a request now for further facilities mignt be misrepresented as a breach of faith which might prejudice our position wi the Trucial Arabs generally, though this danger may be considered to have been reduced by the recent tacit acceptance by the Sheikh of the use by the K A i - ^ a shore landing ground. The Admiralty further consider that, even n e proposed negotiations should lead to a successful result, the position in whic e rest vessel and barges will be moored in the lagoon at Ras-al-Khaimah, wnicn is land-locked, and out of sight from warships anchored off the town, will expo the rest vessel and barges to risk of sniping at night by disaffected followers o the local Sheikh or by members of neighbouring tribes seeking an opportuni} embroil the Sheikh. In addition, the Sheikh will be exposed to the risk ot a by neighbouring tribesmen on a serious scale, which might lead to our having ^ support him, and possibly to carry out punitive operations. In the even ,. trouble occurring, the fact that at Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Qai wain wars p cannot enter the Lagoon, but are forced to lie some one and a half miles s ward, makes it impossible for the Navy to afford any defence without lan g forces from the ship. The Admiralty also point out that a further complies would be introduced in the event of an aircraft operated by a foreign comp^ becoming involved in any incident on the Trucial coast, since the nece , measures to obtain reparations and to ensure future protection might deve op a question of international concern. 9. The Air Ministry do not entirely share the Admiralty views, opinion, based on considerable experience of tribal control in widely cj. countries, the maintenance of the rest vessel and the necessary Imperial installation on the Trucial Coast can best be obtained by imposing respom upon the Sheikh concerned; by supporting his authority if his attitude ls ger | oUS factory, and by rapid action against him if it is not. In the ev ? nt /^aircraft incident occurring on the Trucial Coast, the Air Ministry view is thatoperating in conjunction with warships would be an effective, powerful and rapid means of restoring the situation. 10. The War Office are generally interested, but are not directly concerned in the question of the maintenance of the civil air route to India, except in so far as the Adtniralty fears may prove to be justified, and a call may be made for troops for the protection of the proposed landing station on the Trucial Coast in an ^nergency. They regard it as important to maintain and develop a strategic air route along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, but are doubtful how far this will be furthered by the establishment of a civil route for seaplanes. 11. The Treasury appreciate the importance of the air route to India. They would have preferred to see a complete statement of the finance of the projected new route before being committed in any way. In view, however, of the urgency of the case they will raise no objection to the proposed negotiation with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah when the issue of policy involved in the transfer to the Arabian coast route has been decided by the Cabinet or by the Ministerial Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East. 12. The main issue for decision may be briefly summarised as follows:— It is almost certain that, failing some quite unexpected development, the present air route to India via South Persia will definitely cease to be available as from the end of March 1932. Unless an alternative route can be established in the immediate future, the air service to India will therefore have to be interrupted as from that date. One suggested alternative is the establishment of a sea link (i.e., one stage by ship). This possible alternative has already been explored by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, and is regarded as commercially impracticable. The only alternative to the interruption of the air service to India which at present appears to be practicable is the establishment of the Arabian air route, which, in the view of the Air Ministry and in the light of their investigations, can only successfully be operated if a night stopping station is provided for at Ras-al-Khaimah, or at Umm-al-Qaiwain, on the Trucial Coast. If this station is to be established negotiations must immediately be opened with the Sheikh oi one of these places with a view to obtaining the necessary facilities and guarantees. The establishment of the proposed night stopping station at Ras-al-Khaimah, or at Umm-al-Qaiwain, is open to the serious risks foreseen by the Admiralty and indicated in paragraph 8 above. 13. The Official Sub-Committee, having considered the question in all its bearings, have come to the conclusion that, on the information at present available, and in view of the urgency of the matter, the balance of argument lies in favour of initiating without further delay the necessary preliminary steps for the establishment of a civil air route along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, with a station at Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Qaiwain, notwithstanding the risks involved. They therefore recommend :— (a) That the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf be authorised immediately to open negotiations with the Arab rulers concerned and to endeavour to secure an agreement, to be subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government, with one of them, whereby in return for a payment not exceeding £3,000 a year he and his tribesmen wall provide Imperial Airways with the necessary facilities and guarantees, and {b) That the Air Ministry should be authorised to make the necessary pro visional arrangements forthwith with Imperial Airways for the institution of a service of flying boats from Basra to Gwadar or Karachi via the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, to be ready to begin operations at the end of March 1932.

Barge at Ras-al-Khaiinah with the Residency Age^*t who reported that he had se^t 300' rupees to the Sheikh or Ras-al-Xhaimah aa the first quarter’s instalment of subsidy for guarding th« oil barge. The Gheikh returned the money with a request that Isa himself should go to hand it c*er. ‘ , ’ Isa went to Ras-al-Khaimah accordingly and offered the money to the Cheikh who refused it on the grounds that if he accoutred the monejrnow he would be-precluded from havin any further discussion on the question of the oil barge with the Political Resident. It was agreed, therefore, that the money should rest with Isa until the Sheikh had met the Political Resident and had come to a final agreement with him.l In view of the fact that the Sheikh had agreed last May to thn barge remaining at nae-al-Khaimah, Isa asked him why he wanted to see the Political Resident and pointed out that he had not asked for‘a time to be fixed for such a meeting. To this question the Sheikh raplied that he wanted to beg the Government, through the Political Resident, tftat the barge should be moved out of the Creek. He was told* by Isa that the Political Resident would never aaxee to this and he suggested that the Sheikh nig^it provide a godown as he had previously considered doing ana that Chen the barge would most certainly be moved, lo this su gg estion the Sheikh renlied that he would give no got own, m fact he preferred-to have the barge. n . Isa then pointed out that the Sheikh had already promised to accept the rest and asked why he now failed to fulfil his promises. The Sheikh countered by suggesting that his orople feared the British; who when” once they had some footing, would then want a landing ground ana gradually would ask for more and, more rights which It would be impossible for him to grant. *’ ,, ^ x ~ , The Sheikh was informed that the British Government did nr&gt;t wish for any further concessions, but toia isa that the' latter might today give him his word of honour on that point, tomorrow Isa might be relieved of his nost and then where would he (the Sheikh) stand in relation to the promises made. Ke then proceeded to tell Isa that he and his people were Tahabis, that the Head of the 7/ahabis is ibn oaud ana that if British Government persisted in forcing their policy upon him, he would place himself under thy Pfjwecuion oi ion Saud who would deal with the matter direct with the British Government. So far as he was concerned there the matter endtd, he would appeal to Ibn Saud and end the friendly iroaty with Great Britain, , . isa advised him that this attitude would n 0 t do him eny good and in fact would get him into trouble, for in accordence ^ith the terms of his Treaty he was debarred from appealing to another country. Ras-al-Khaimah maintained that other Sheikhs would appeal to Ibn Saud. Isa told him that he did not think that the other Sheikhs were of the same frame oi mi v*There the conversation ended. 5 # So far ms i cmn (gather the“Sheikh of Has-al-Khaimah had already had an interview with Ibn Sauci nome two years a^o. The latter appears to have reminded him of his Treaty er.p’agements with Great Britain, but at the same time v the Sheikh affected to be left with the impression that he* is unreservedly placed himself under Ibn Saud’s protection by a written instrument, the latter would consider the matter. 6 # *• It will be recalled that the agreement arrived at between the Sheikh of Ran-al-Khaimah and'the Political Resident after the Naval Operations last June was subject to the following conditions:- (a) That the barge should remain in the Creek for one j ftear during which period tne future arrangements Tor the storage of petrol will be discussed with the Pplitical Resident and a representative of the Royal Air Force* (b) The*British authorities will have the right to re lenish tne oil barge whenever necessary. (c) The Sheikh will appoint guards for the protection of the barge. (d) The Sheikh undertakes responsibility for the snfety of aircraft landing at Ras-al-Xhaimah. (e) The Sheikh will be paid a suitable monthly subsidy for providing the guards. must submit to the use o he gave no permission an upon him. X X X 9.

It is understood that a meeting of the Ministerial Suh-Committee is contemplated for 19 November. The Official Sub-Committee was unanimous as to the actual recommendations made in para. 13 of its memorandum., and in such circumstances under the normal procedure an actual meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Committee is not required (unless of course one of the Minister's concerned desires it), and Ministerial approval is signified without a meeting. Presumably, however, in view of the importance of this suuject and the desire of the Admiralty that their point of view should be brought to the notice of Ministers, the Secretariat of the C.I.N* assumed that a meeting wo^ld be desirable. There would seem to be little difficulty in rsgaxu i to the approval of the Official Sub-Committee’s actual recommendations (from which the Admiralty have not dissented) . The difficulty felt oy the Admiralty ifeally has regard to further questions which could be explored i after the initial step ofLpending negotiations had been taken viz.

The basis of a draft memorandun was prepare by Mr. Rendel, the chairman of the Sub-Committee, and was discussed with him and subsequently with the Air Ministry and the Admiralty on 3 November. The Admiralty asked that the full statement of their views contained in paragraph 8 should be incorporated; subject to this they were prepared to concur in the proposals for immediate action made in the last para graph of the memorandum. At the resumed meeting of the Sub-Committee on $ November, paragraph 9 (state ment of the views of the Air Ministry on the defence problem) was added. Paragraphs 10 and 11 (views of the War Office and Treasury) were also added. At this meeting (on £ November) the chairman (rather unnecessarily) challenged the Admiralty attitude; he suggssted if their view as to the rials of a night stopping place on the Trucial coast was so serious as indicated in paragraph 8, it was hardly logical for them to concur in the conclusions of the memorandum, and it might be preferable xor them to submit a minority report. Fortunately, however, the Admiralty would not accept this suggestion; their attitude is that they do not wish to ask tha^ the initial step of the negotiations with the She Lea should be deferred pending a consideration of the defence problem and of possible alternatives to the Trucial coast, but that they are anxious mat these further questions should be considered and that,in approving/Minute Puper.

I supported the Admiraltyias against the chairman’s \ &lt;*#r*t**^ that a minority report should be submitted / a since, in order to save time, it seemed desirable that an ^friMeeA. report in favour of the definite proposals /* in the last paragraph of the memorandum should be made by the Official Sub-Committee. The meeting decided on this course^ prefacing the recommendations in the last paragraph with the preamble which appears tier*. f weighing up the pros and cons. In paragraph 13 (a) the words ’’subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government” meanlj^ that the agreement would contain a clause providing for ratifi cation or confirrnation by His Majesty’s Government, not that Colonel Biscoe will have to report for approva 1 at each stage of the negotiations. It may be con venient, however, that if and when he reaches the basis of an agreement, the actual agreement itself should be drafted here and telegraphed out to him in order that we may be sure that it is in proper form and that the details are approved by the Departments concerned. The agreement migjit be one of considerable detail if Colonel Biscoe finds it possible to adopt all the suggestions that iiatifbe made, e.g. the Government of India’s suggestions that part of the payment should take the form of rent for the laguon and wages for native guards etc., and a further suggestion made by the Treasury and Air Ministry that part of the payment should take the shape of landing fees which would be paid by Imperial Airways for each separate/ 4 «4A 5000 5/30‘ULinvito Paper.

At the meeting yesterday of the Middle East Official Sub-Commission of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Grieve suggested that the allowance to the Sheikh at Ras-al-Khaimah might be in the form of landing dues. On consideration I think that there is a good deal to be said for some portion, at any rate, of the payments to the Sheikh taking the form of a landing charge for each time an Imperial Airways seaplane lands in his Lagoon. I do not suggest that the whole of the payments should take this form, ^but that the payments should be partly a fee for guaranteeing the safety of the Rest Vessel and Re-fueling Barge and partly for each landing. The advantages as I see it in favour of landing charges for each seaplane using the Lagoon is that this is practically a universal method here and in all other countries and also because the frequent payments to the Sheikh by Imperial Airways on each visit would ensure his taking a continuing interest in the weekly arrivals of the seaplanes. Also, in the event of the route being followed by the Dutch and French airlines, the responsibilities of the Sheikh would increase, but as he could levy the same charges from the Dutch and French seaplanes, no additional charge would have to be made from British funds. I am sending a copy of this letter to Grieve and suggest that you should bear this proposal in mind when negotiations have been opened by Biscoe. “ ‘ &amp; lton Esq., c.B., India Office, S.W.l.

Memorandum. Uy ^-- ie S tapUijig^JOfTLQ,.~‘ woinia ^.^ The Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have held two meetings to consider this question, which has become one of great urgency* 2, Ig has become clear that there is now little or no hope of obtaining from the Persian Government an extension of the permission for the use by Imperial Airways of the existing route across southern Persia. It was hoped last July Aiat the desire of the Persian Government to secure ^he re-opening cl the Duzdab Railway might have furnished the means of striking a bargain with Persia by which an extension of the permit to Uo South Persian route might be obtained. It i±ov oeems improbable that such a bargain can be conluded, a.nd xu essential to face the fact that 9 in all r&gt;rcba^ilxty, t.^e Persian air route will be def initely closed do on. a^ the March 1932, It is therefore of the utmost importance, if the air service to India is not to be interrupted, that an alternative route should be prepared with the least possiole dv_. y , nCt moreover, the only hope 3. In the opinion of the Foreign Offic- mor &gt; _ - . . li 4--^^ Persian Government on this of continuing negotiations witn the -ur.- subject with the remotest chance of success lied i^ cur having an alternative route to fall aack on. So long as the Persians1 1 I » regard us as 'being entirely In 'ttuoln-porrer' Ijx tlile-Taalrter y negotiations will be impossible. The preparation of an alternative route therefore is necessary, not only in order that we may fall back on that route if and when the Persian route is finally closed, but as furnishing the only hope of perhaps after all obtaining an extension of the Persian route by negotiation, 4, The Air Ministry, who have carefully studied the various alternative routed,consider that the only practicable alternative is a route from Basra to Gwadar (and Karachi) following the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, This would necessitate the use of flying boats instead of land planes, and would involve, in addition to a halt at Bahrein (which presents no difficulty), the development of a regular V landing place and refuelling station at some point on the Trucial Coast, where passengers would have to spend the night. The Air Ministry consider that the only practicable points for this landing place would be either the lagoon or creek at Has al Khaimah or that at Umm alQaiwain where a rest vessel and petrol supply barge could be moored. Prom this point it would be possible to fly to Gwadar (which, though belonging to the Sultan of Muscat, is an enclave on the coast of British Baluchistan, and presents no difficulty) in a single flight outside Persian territorial waters, 6. The only really serious difficulty in connection with the development of this route lies in the uncertain attitude of the Trucial Sheikhs, on whose goodwill we shall depend in the first instance for the development of the landing and refuelling station between Bahrein and Gwadar, and subsequently for the safety of the personnel and passengers using the station. 6. The India Office hope that it may be possible to secure the necessary facilities and guarantees from the Sheikh of Has al Khaimah, or from the Sheikh of Umm al Qaiwain, in return for a subsidy not exceeding £3,000 a year. - 2 -In view of the urgency of the matter, they are most anxious that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should he authorised to open negotiations on the basis suggested, when he visits this area in the very near future. They hope that the payment of the proposed subsidy could be arranged in such a way as not only to secure the acquiescence of the Sheikh concerned in the establishment of the landing and refuelling station in his lagoon or creek, but also so as to secure his co-operation and that of his unruly subjects and potential rivals, in guaranteeing the safety of the installation. The India Office and Hr Ministry can suggest no other alternative, and are hopeful that this proposal will secure the necessary minimum of safety to render possible the continued operation of the air route to India. The arrangements involved will take some months to complete and it is therefore of the utmost importance that a settlement should be reached well before the end of the present year. Before any negotiations can be opened with the rulers concerned, however, it is necessary to obtain Treasury sanction for the proposed subsidy. 7. The Admiralty, while not disputing the desirability of ensuring the continuance of the air route to India, regard the proposal of the India Office and Air Ministry as involving considerable risks and as liable to lead to commitments on a larger scale than the other Departments anticipate. They would have much preferred that the landing and refuelling station betv;oen Bahrein and Gwadar should either be eliminated or situated on one of the islands in the Persian Gulf or at a point under more direct British control than either Has ul ' Khaimah or Umm al Qatwain. They would therefore urge that a further investigation should be made of the possible alternatives but if, as the Air Ministry contend, those alternatives should still proveAdmiralty also point out that a further complication would he introduced in the event of an aircraft operated hy a foreign company 'becoming involved in any incident on the Trucial coast, since the necessary measures to obtain reparations and to ensure future protection might develop into a question of international concern* 9» The Air Ministry do not entirely share the Admiralty views. In their opinion, based on considerable experience of tribal control in widely differing countries, the maintenance of the rest vessel and Imperial Airways installation on the Trucial Coast can best be obtained by imposing responsibility upon the Sheikh concerned; by supporting his authority if his attitude is satisfactory, and by rapid action against him if it is not. In the event of a serious incident occurring on the Trucial coast, the Air Ministry view is that aircraft operating in conjunction with warships would be an effective, powerful and rapid means of restoring the situation. 10. Th War Office are most interested but are not directly concerned in the question of the maintenance of the civil air route to India, except in so far as the Admiralty fears may prove to be justified and a call may be made for troops for the protection of the proposed landing station on the Trucial coast in an emergency. They regard it as important to maintain and develop a strategic air route along the Arabian coast of tne Persian exulf, but are doubtful how far this will be furthered by the establishment of a civil route for seaplanes. H. ihe Treasury appreciate the importance of the air route to India. They would have preferred to see a complete statement cf the finance of tnexorojectcd nev: route 'before 'being eommitted in any way. In view however of the urgency of the case they will raise no objection to the proposed negotia tion with the Sheikh of has al Khaimah when the issue of policy involved in the transfer to the Arabian coast route has been decided by the Cabinet or by the Ministerial Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle Bast. 12. The main issue for decision may be briefly summarised as follows It is almost certain that, failing some quite unexpected development, the present air route to India via South Persia will definitely cease to be available as from March 1932. Unless an alternative route can be established in the immediate future, the air service to India will.therefore have to ce interrupted as from that date, and could only be maintained by the establishment of a sea lin^. This possible alternative has already Deen expaoi ea by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, and is regarded as commercially impracticable. The only alternative to the interruption of the air service to India which at present appears to be praetieetle is the establishment of the Arabian air route, which, in the view of the Air Ministry and in the light of their investigations, can only successfully be established if a night stopping station is provided for at Has al Ehaiman, or Umm al Qaiwain. If this station is to be established negotiations must immediately be opened with tne Sheikh with a view to obtaining the necessary facilitie and guarantees. The establishment of a rest station at Umm al Qaiwain, however, is at Ras al Khaimah, orWUIfllW O. /— and indicated in paragraph 8 above. 13 . The Official oro-Conunittee, having considered the question in all its bearings, has cone to the con clusion that, on the information at present available, and in view of the urgency of the matter, the balance of argument lies in favour of initiating without further delay the necessary preliminary steps for the establishment of a civil air route al nr the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, with a station at Has al Khaim ah or Umn al Qaiwain, notwithstanding the risks involved. They therefore recommend (a) that the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf should be authorised immediately to open negotiations with the Arab ruiers concerned and to endeavour to secure an agreement, subject to the approval of Kis Llajesty* s Government, with one of tnem whereby in return for a payment not exceeding £ 3,000 a year, he and his tribesmen will provide Imperial with the necessary facilities and guarantees, and (b) that the Air Ministry should be autnonsed to make the necessary provisional arrangements forthwith with Imperial Airways for the institution of a service of flying boa^s, via the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, to be ready to begin operations at tne ena a a. March 1952. (Signed)TILL SUB-'COxdxITT^li met to consider the following:- Paper No. M.£.(0] 38 - Draft oi a memorandum on the question of the Eastern Ai- r Route prepared by representatives of the Foreign Offioe ; India Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry, for presentation to the Ministerial Sub-Committee, MRo RiNDEL stated that, before discussing the draft memorandum In detail, the Air Ministry wished to raise a specific point, which he accordingly ashed Group-Captain Peirse to explain. GROUP-CAPTAIN PEIRSE stated that, after perusal of the draft memorandum, the Air Ministry felt that the dangers and difficulties so forcibly pointed out by the Admiralty would leave Ministers in a state of considerable apprehension and that as the Royal Air Force was one of the very interested fighting departments concerned in the Persian Gulf, they felt bound, therefore, to record their views because these were not wholly in accord with these of the Admiralty. He prefaced these view’s by pointing out that the R*a.P. had had considerable experience of tribal control during the past IE or 15 years. In their experience control cou-ici oest be obtained by placing responsibility for law and oruei on the local Sheikh or headman. Should he falx for lack of support, action was then taken to support him. Should he rebel or disorder arise through any misdemeanour cn his part, action was then immediately taken against him an^ his followers. Success lay in the speed with //xiicn the action was tasen whilst the misdemeanour was yet in the min^s of the individuals concerned. These methods. Group Captain Peirse stated, had proved successful and it seemed reasonable to suppose that the tribes on the Irucial coast would prove no exception. In any case, the Air Ministry considered that should an unfortunate incident arise, aircraft were likely uOin conjunction with warships was likely to prove adequate to restoro the situation. He states further that the Air Ministry ulu not visualise the employment of Imperial Troops. CAPTAIN COTNINGKAM stated that the Royal Navy had 'been operating on the Trucial coast for many years and had had considerable experiance in dealing with local Gheikhs. They had thought it their duty to point out the implications likely to be involved were a night halting place for aircraft established in this region. They felt strongly that Ministers should be informed on this subject and had accordingly presented this aspect of the case. It certainly was never the intention of the Admiralty to exclude the possibility of co-operation with the Royal Air Force in the event of an emergency arising. MR. WALTON observed that defence- measures must certainly be discussed, though no detailed plan could obviously be settled at present. MR. RNNDRL agreed that the views of the Air Ministry on the question of defence ought to be stated in the Memorandum. The Admiralty vieiss on this point wer e fully explained in paragraph 8. The War Office views were stated in paragraph 9. The Air Ministry view that an emergency could to a large extent be dealo .with by air action could not be ignored, and he sugges-ed that a new paragraph expressing the Air x&gt;iinis ^ry vie,/ on tie defence question should be inserted between paragraphs 8 and 9 of the draft. A new paragraph (paragraph 9 of the revised draft) was accordingly prepared and agreed to.T.rp, Rl&lt;;NI)EL then raised the following question. The difficulties and dangers vhich the Admiralty foresaw in the establishment of the Arabian route were very fully stated in the draft memorandum* but the final recommendation of the Sub-Committee was that the establisnment of vhe frahian route should be proceeued //ith* It ^as n-^^ elear whether the Admiralty really subscribed to this recommenda tion. Indeed^their views* as expressed in the memorandum* developed a strong case against its adoption. He considered that the memorandum in its present form was fundamentally unsatisfactory * end would place ministers in e. di-d iulu position * since it .argued strongly against tne esteoliSj.im.ent of an Arabian air route with stopping places on tne iru^ial Coast* and then proceeded to recommend that authority should be given to proceed with the matter. He felt that une Admiralty should either subscribe to some general statement* such as* that* in view of the arguments in favour of the Arabian route and the apparent absence 01 any alternative* they would waive their objections and deiinitely subscribe to the recommendation of the CuD-Committee tnat tiie establishment of the route should be proceeded with*_ or majority alternatively* that the Admiralty should dissent from tne/ recommendation of the Gub-Conunittee and produce a minority report suggesting some alternative course of action* no did not regard the general statement at the beginning ox para. 7* that the Admiralty 'did not dispute the desirability of ensuring the continuance of the air route to India * as going far enough* CAPTAIN CUNNINGNAK demurred and stated that the sole object of the Admiralty was to ensure that tne risks involved were brought to the notice of the Ministers concerned. 1° was not within their province* nor was it their desiro* uoor not They sav whether n civil nir routo wns eoS^nt.^^! wt.ro net 5 hov;ever ? convinced that every alternative had ocen fully explored 5 such as the estaclisniTient Ox o. sea— home linlc bet ween Bahrein and (rvudar s which would only entail a delay 01 souie six aoui -stated tnat tni3 solution hc^d o^en considered s hut rejected on the ground that owing to tne ver/ limited load carried hy aircraft it was not comnercicu. ly practicable. Hlh RZiNDBL maintained his objections to the menorandum in its present form. He felt strongly that the Admiralty should either admit that, in view of the arguments on the other side, they were prepared net to press their oooecticns, or should definitely dissent from tne conclusion ox one Sub-Cossraittee. To moke rocoiamendations to Ministers, ana t'.vs saac tin« to argue so coaclueivdy against/ tiiose resonio.endations in the explanatory memoranduia, v.as ilaogioul, and would mahe it Host difficult for Ministers to give a satisfactory decision. MS. GBI372 suggested that two alternative propositions should be put before Ministers s supported by two sets of ■ .rgunents ; and that the Ministerial Sub-Coiandttee should be ashed to choose between then. He also wished to submit a redraft of paragraph 10 of the draft memorandum, somewhat re-stating the Treasury point of view. MS. P-ETIDSL accepted Mr. Grieve's re-dr-aft of paragraph 10, which now appears as paragraph 11 of the revised draft; but he saw strong objection to putting two alternatives before Ministers without giving them a lead in favour of one or the other. He felt that the Sub-Committee ought to cone into the open and definitely recommend one course of action.On the other hand, he felt that the difficulty might be got over 11 ; after ohe views of the various Departments and the Admiralty objections had been stated, the various alternatives were summarised, together with a summary of the arguments in favour of, and against, each 0 After this summary a paragraph could be inserted explaining that, on the balance, the Sub-Commit tee definitely re commended one particular course of action. He thought# that it would he very difficult to embark on negotiations with the Sheikhs if we wore not prepared to carry them through. The Political Resident might find tho Sheikh willing to accept a settlement provided it were concluded at once. In his view the mere opening of negotiations would go a long way towards committing us to the adoption of the Arabian route and to the acceptance of the dangers foreseen by the Admiralty* Were the Admiralty really prepared to subscribe to the recommendation of the Sub committee on such a basis? CAPTAIN GUMIIiJG-HAM saw no need for the negotiations to be definitely concluded at this stage. The urgent question appeared to be to obtain authority for the Poliiical Resident to initiate the negotiations. The course of these negotiations might give a useful indication of how far the Admiralty fears were justified. In any case we did not wish to commit ourselves finally on the Arabian coast, since it had been explained that one of the in proceeding with the / cb jectspreparations for the establishment of the Arabian route was the chance that it might strengthen our* hands in dealing with the Persians. There was therefore still a slight hope that the Persian route might prove available after all 5 or why otherwise should the effect of the present proposal on our position v is-a-vis the Persians be of any importance; and if this was so &lt;, we obviously could not commit ourselves definitely and finally to the Arab Sheihhs at this stage. Moreover- in the opinion of the admiralty some better alternative route might still be found. 1 PR. PEITPSL admitted the force of this argument s and added that in -any case it would be important not to enter into a permanent arrangement with the Sheikh $ which might be binding for all time and tie our hands in the distant future. Any agreement reached should either be of a temporary nature or should have a provision enabling us to denounce it. These points and those raised by the .admiralty could all be net* however 9 if it were specified in the recommendation of the Sub-Committee that any agreement which Colonel Biscoe might reach with the Sheikh* or Sheikhs &lt;, concerned should be subject to tne approval of His linjesty's Government. Tnis would mean that even' if Colonel Biscoe found it necessary to conclude an agreement immediately he could still explain that the agreement needed the ratification or approval of his Majesty s Government - which would be reasonable - and we should then still be free to reconsider the matter and make any necessary amendments in it. The question of the temporary or terminable character of the agreement was a subsidiary point which could oe dealt with departmentally in the instructions issued to Colonel Biscoe. MR. GRIEVE suggested that the question of the duration of the agreement might be got over by arranging that any2 Wh IOBt» wnm pa v ncnt made to tiie local oiieiiai v/ould o e in tho i o&gt;. , C)f landing or harbour dues 5 on tho oasis 07 ? the nunher of 1 ridings made- This night encourage him to he helpful ? as he would naturally he anxious to see increased axr tr^xxic nad with it increased revenue. Thh iflR MINISTRY saw certain objections to this proposal which was not proceeded with. CnPTAIIT OTiRTINdHAIi asked that it should be recorded that the Admiralty&gt; while unav/are of the details of the proposed rest house* were of opinion that the transport to* mooring of* and subsequent maintenance of such a station m tne lagoon ^ u Ras al Khaimah may involve considerable difficulty. MR. RENDriL th^n redrafted the final paragraphs of Mae memorandum on the lines suggested at the meeting* so as to state the two alternative courses which appeared to bo open to his Majesty's Government and to show that the duo-Oomittee on the balance of argument definitely recommended tne adoption of a particular line.

This question had been before the Cabinet in July last, but no decision had been reached on the main issue of the establishment of the Arabian route as at the last moment the possibility had presented itself of striking a bargain with Persia, by which the Persian Government should agree to extend the permission for Imperial Aar ways to use the South Persian air route after its present date of expiration in March 1932 9 in return for the re-opening of the Du 2 dab Railway to which they appeared to attach some importance. No progress had been made in this direction, however, and it now seemod most improbable that a settlement would be reached on these lines* The Foreign Office view indeed was that the possibility of obtaining from the Persians any extension of the permit to use the South Persian route was now exceedingly remote* His Majesty T s Government had no levers to use with the Persians in this matter, and so long as they had no alternative route to fall back on were in a hopelessly weak position vis-a--vis the Persian Government* with the Persians in their present state of mind, there was no likelihood of loobtaining any concession from them so long as they thought that we were entirely in their power and dependent on them xor enr main air communications to India* In view therefore (l) of the fact that the South Persian route would almost certainly not he available after March 1932, and (2) of the fact that we were in any case helpless in dealing with the Persians unless we had an alternative to the South Persian route ready to fall bach on P the Foreign Office considered it a matter of great importance that the preparation of an alternative route should be proceeded with with the least possible delay, unless His Majesty's G-overnment were prepared to see the air service to India definitely interrupted^ The establishment of an alternative route along the Arabian coast involved negotiations with certain of the Arabian rulers concerned* including the offer of a subsidy in return for certain necessary facilities end guarantees. These negotiations would be difficult and should be initiated at the earliest possible moment« Colonel Biscoe, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* was expected to visit the Trueiad Coast about the middle of November, and it was very desirable that the necessary instructions should be sent to him in time to enable him to initiate the proposed negotiations during his impending visit* MRo RITIDhL believed that there was a general agreement among the Departments concerned on these points, but he understood that two difficulties had arisen, and it was particularly to deal with these that the present meeting had been chiled* The first was that the Treasury were reluctant to give tne necessary sanction for the proposed subsidy to the Arabian ruler, or rulers, concerned - without the specific autaority either of the Cabinet or of a Cabinet Committee a The second was that the Admiralty would beclosely concerned with the question of the protection of any landing places or rest houses established on the Arabian coast and that he understood that they wished to raise certain points in connection with this aspect of the matter* • h II hhL asked Mr. Grieve to explain the treasury point of view. authoritative IMVE said that in the Treasury ruling should be sought either view an from the Cabinet or from the Ministerial Committee as to the policy of opening the new route. The decision of the Cabinet in July last certainly gave no authority for establishing an air route along the Arabian shore or for expend!tune thereon. Obviously the Treasury would have preferred to see a comprehensive financial statement of the capital and runnin^ costs of the new route. He understood however that this could net be made available at the present time and that the matter was of sufficient urgency that the preliminary arrangements in respect of Has al Khaimah should be made at once. He therefore confined his point to the necessity of obtaining an authoritative decision in the matter of policy. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM stated that the Admiralty feared that there would be considerable difficulties in maintaining such a route 5 especially if it were attempted to establish a rest stage at Ras al Khaimah or any other place on the strip of coast controlled by the Trucial Sheikhs. This coast was in a constant state of unrest, owing to the rivalries of the various local Chieftains. An unfortunate incident might easily arise which it would be the business of the Admiralty, and possibly the war Office, to clear up. 3At Pas al Khaimah the proposed 'floating rest house' would ce uoored in an enclosed lagoon within easy rifle range of tnc palm groves on the shore, and very liable to attack, particularly by any discontented local elements who wished to involve the local aheikh in trouble. He considered that more than a few armed guards would be required for defence purposes. in his view, a subsidy tc the or Has al Khaimah would by no moans represent the ultimate cost. Other local Oheikhs would uemana suosidies, and there also existed the possibility of involving Ibn Saud. Hhile the Admiralty recognised the desirability 01 011 ' Ji ^ r r '°^te along the Arab coast, they had no ini.ormation to show that all possible alternatives had been fully exp lored. He suggested that the island of Abu iiusa, which lios some sixty miles to the west of Pas al Khaimah would be an alternative rest stage on tnc route. Here the problem of defence was simple, and, being an island some two miles long by one mile broad, whatever the direction of the 7/ind it seemed possible tha-*: by providing alternative moorings on either side of the island the necessary facilities could be ensured, he was aware that Abu Musa could not be used for land planes, whereas a landing ground at Has al Khaimah was practicable, but it was apparently admitted that this route must now be operated by flying boats. ohould nbu Musa prove impracticable, he suggested imperial Airways should be asked to consider further the possibility of a non-stop flight from Bahrein to Hwadar, which would obviate any landing on the Trucial coast* He considered that the full implications and risks(2~ll inrolved s if an air station Trere csLablishod at Has al Kh&amp;im&amp;h* should he brought to the notice of the Ministers concerned before they arrived at my decision. He w„s averse to any immediate reference being made to the Ctbinet cr the Ministerial Committee unless this had been done* COLONEL iSIHSAY said that the war Office agreed with the Admiralty point of view. MR. &gt;.ALTON stated that the sum of £3,,000 repre sented an outside limit at the disposal of the Political He 3 ident in the Gulf as allowances to the Sheikh of Ras al Khaiaah and other local notables- The main object of these allowances would be to secure the goodwill of the Sheikh and his people and thus facilitate the establishment of the route and reduce the difficulties of defence to a minimum* In this region the inhabitants are very pcor 5 particularly so at the present moment, owing to depression in the pearling industry, cons eluent a small amount of money goes a long way. In his view this expenditure was not merely a subsidy, but a definite q uid p ro quo, i.e. , expenditure cn account of rent of the lagoon at R&amp;s al Khaimah, ana a further sum tc the local inhabitants for its protectj.cn. The Secretary cf State for India was anxious to start preparations for the establishment cf this route at the earliest possible moment. MR. BERTRAM sail that it was the intention of Imperial Airways to operate a seaplane service between Basra and Karachi via the Arabian coastal route. j.n this event it would be necessary tc establish some intermediate stage where passengers would pass the night and aircraft It was proposed to anchor a vessel to serve as a refuelrest house for passengers, as a stores depot, a wireless station, and as permanent quarters for a few operators and mechanics* A barge for the storage of oil fuel and two moorings for seaplanes would also he necessary* Has al Khaimah had been chosen as the most suitable place, as the result of surveys by Air Ministry representa tives. Abu Musa had been reconnoitred by the present Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, who had twice visited the island and who had reported that it was impracticable. F.as al Khaimah was accordingly the most suitable place for an intermediate resting stage, Bahrein and Owadar being convenient halts for fuelling purposes, while Koweit, Yas island and Crmara formed emergency refuelling stations en route. As regards the Admiralty suggestion to fly from Bahrein to CKadar in one flight, the distance involved, i.e*, over seven hundred miles, was not outside the power of aircraft, but owing to the amount of petrol etc. , that would have to be carried, any economic load was impossible- hot only was such a long distance flight undesirable, from the point of view of maintenance and wear and tear involved, but a complete re-adjustment of Imperial Airways route and times would be required. CROUP C APT All! PBIRBS was convinced that the possibilities of Abu Musa had been fully explored by the Air Ministry., Ho recognised that the question of defence at Has al Khaimah and the risks involved should be pointed out to the Ministers concerned. The Air Ministry were, however, very anxious to obtain an early decision to open negotiations with the Trucial chiefs with a view to establishing this route* GoViR. HKUD3L emphasised, the importance of proceeding without further delay to the preparation of some alternative to the South Persian route;, which would almost certainly not be available after March 1932* If the air service to India was not to be closed down, the development of the Arabian route appeared to be the sole solution. If, however, this was to be ready in time to be of any use, negotiations must be opened with the Arabian rulers concerned at once. Authority was required to enable the Political Resident to do this during his impending visit to the Tracial Coast and to enable him to offer the subsidy which had been Tjroposed. The general views of the Sub-Committee night be summed up as follows: The AIR MINISTRY &amp; 11131A OFFICE considered that in view of the urgency of the question immediate steps snou—d dg uam^n to secure the necessary Ministerial authority. The FOREIGN OFFICE \ who had long been pressing the urgency of the matter shared this view. The ADMIRALTY on the other hand considered that Ministers should not be asked to authorise the opening cl negotiations with the Arab rulers or the offer to those rulers of the proposed subsidy without having the dangers and difficulties involved placed clearly before them. The WAR OFFICE were Inclined to support this view, and regarded with misgiving the possibility of being calj.ed upon to supply ground troops in an emergency fo., the protection of the proposed Trucial Coast landing and refueller station. The TREASURY wished before sanctioning the payment of the proposed subsidy to have authority f rom the Cabinet, or a cab ire u Committee, which would cover net only the subsidy but any fui + ner expenditure involved should the dangers anticipated by the Admiralty materialise. They did ndt wish to oppose any step o which might be necessary for the maintenance of the air serviceto India, 'but. they 'were anxious that all the aspects of the question should he fully considered before we committed ourselves to a policy which might involve ultimate further exp enditur 0 » The COLONIAL OFT ICE asked for a few days delay before the matter was referred to Ministers in order to study the question further and submit the necessary information regarding it to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who, as Chairman cf the Ministerial Sub-Committee for Middle Eastern Questions, was very closely concerned,, ME. RIITDEL therefore suggested that an effort should be made to prepare a comprehensive memorandum putting the whole matter before the Ministerial Sub-Committee and setting out the views of the various Departments. He suggested that the Admiralty, Air Ministry and India Office representatives should prepare a joint statement of their viev/s which could then be incorporated by the Foreign Office into a comprehensive draft, and that the Official Sub-Committee should meet again as soon as possible in order to consider this draft with a view to its submission to Ministers. CONCLUSI ON. The Sub-Committee agreed (a) that Captain Cunningham, Group-Captain Peirse and Mr. Walton should rr epare a draft statement explaining the Admiralty, Air Ministry and India Office points of view, and showing the advantages and disadvantages involved. (b) that the Foreign Office should then embody this statement in a draft memorandum on the whole question for consideration at the next meeting of the Official Sub-Committee (c) that the Official Sub-Committee should meet at S p.m. on Thursday November 5, at 2 S Whitehall Gardens, S.\v.l„, consider the draft statement in its final form, itehall Gardens, S.W.l,, 4th November, 19-31, -E- to^ k^L. - Li c£o^ Z*^ ^ J iir^ ^** ( ^ v ^- ^ S ^ 'Lq^J- j ^ L-\ wv_, ^ 'fe.

The basis of the draft memorandum, except paragraph 8 which was incorporated by the Admii ally, was prepared by Mr. Rendel the chairman of the suo- committee; it was discussed with him yesterday and subsequently with representatives of ohe Air Minisory and Admiralty.

Dr af t Mem or an dum rr e par ed by r epr esentatives cf the F c re iIndj. a Office, Admiralty and Ai r Minist ry a The Standing Official Suh-ConMittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have held two meetings to consider this question, v/hich has become one 01 great urgency* 2 0 lb has become clear that there is now little or no hope of obtaining from the Persian Government an extension of the permission, for the use by Imperial Airways 01 the existing route across southern Persia* It was hoped last July that the desire of the Persian Government to secure the re-opening of the Dubdab Railway might nave furnished the means of striking a bargain with Persia by which an extension of the permit to use the South Persian route might be obtained* It now seems highly improbable that such a bargain can be concluded; and it is essential to face the fact that, in all probability, the Couth Persian air route will be definitely closed down at the end of Larch 1932. It is therefore of the utmost importance, if the air service to India is not to be interrupted, that an alternao^ve -oate should be prepared with the least possible delay* 3* In the opinion of the Foreign Office moreover, the only hope of continuing negotiations with the Persian Government on A As subject with the remotest chance of success lies in our having an alternative route to fall back on- Sa long as the Persians regard us as teing entirely in their power in this matter, negotiations will The preparation of an alternative rout^ be impossible.y' r* “« ft? , In vie 7 / of the urgency of the matter, they are moot anxious y ** n that the Political Besident in tiie Persian Gulf should he authorised to open negotiations on the basis suggested, when he visits this area in the very near future* 1 hey consider that the payment of the proposed subsidy could be arranged in such a way as not only to secure the acquiescence of the Sheikh concerned in the establishment of the landing and refuelling station in his lagoon or creek, but also so as to secure his co-operation and that of his unruly subjects and potential rivals, in guaranteeing the safety of the installation. The India Office and /dr Ministry can suggest no other alternative, and are hopeful that this proposal will secure the necessary minimum of safety to render possible the continued operation oi the air route to India. The arrangements involved will taive some months to complete and it is therefore of the utmost importance that a settlement should oe reached vvelo. oefore the end of the present year. Before any negotiations can be opened with the rulers concerned, however, it is necessary to obtain Treasury sanction for the proposed subsidy. 7. The Admiralty, while net disputing the desiraoility of ensuring the continuance of the air route to In dia , regard the proposalj^of the India Office and Air Ministry s C as involving considerable risks and as liable ao lead to commitments on a larger' scale than the^ other Departments anticipate! They would have much preferred that the landing and refuelling station between Bahrein and Gwadar should either be eliminated or situated on one of the islands in the Persian Gulf or at a point under more direct British control than either Has al Khaimah or Umm al Qaiwain. They would therefore urge that a further investigation should be made of the possible alternative but if, as the Air Ministry contend, those alternatives should still prove / ^» , c M I*- ^ jtn IJL C-u , • k ‘.u,. -i H /entirely impracticable, they are anxious that the decision to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah and Umm al Qaiwain should not be tal:en without a full realisation of the possible commitments and dangers involved. 8. In this connection the Admiralty point out that when concluding the present agreement for the mooring of the P.A.F. Barge, the Sheikh of Pas al Khaimah. was given to understand by our Resident Agent fan Arab) in response to his specific enquiry, that no further concession would be demanded of him. It is possible therefore that a request now for further facilities might be misrepresented as a breach of faith which might prejudic our position with the Trucial Arabs generally, though this danger may be considered to have been reduced by the recent tacit acceptance by the Ghcikh of the use oy the K.n.F. ox a shore landing ground. The Admiralty further consider that, even if the proposed negotiations should lead to a successful r^sulu, the position in which the rest vessel end ourge^ will be moored in the Lagoon at Has al Khaimah, wnicn is land locked, surrounded by palms and out of sight from warships anchored off the town, will be exposed to risx Ox onipin 0 at night by disaffected followers of the local oheikn or 01 neighbouring tribes seeking an opportunity to embroil the Sheikh. In addition, the Sheikh will be exposed to the risk of attack by neighbouring tribesmen on a serious scale which might lead to our having to support him and possibly to carry out punitive operations. In the event of trouble occurring, the fact that at Has al Khaimah or Umm al Qaiwain warships cannot enter trie Lagoon but are forced to lie some one and a half miles to seaward makes it impossible for the Navy to afford any defence without landing forces from the ship. The5 * Admiralty also point out that a further complication would he introduced in the event of an aircraft operated by a foreign company becoming involved in any incident on the ‘Crucial coast, since the necessary measures to obtain reparations and to ensure future protection might develop into a question of international concern.. 9 . The War Office arc'not directly concerned in the question of the maintenance of the civil air route to India, except in so far as the Admiralty fears may prove to be justified and a call may be made for troops for the protec tion of the proposed landing station on the Trucial coast in an emergency. They regard it as important to maintain and develop a. strategic air route along the Arabian coast of the Persian G-ulf , but are doubtful how far this will be furthered by the establishment of a civil route for sea planes. 10. The Treasury fully appreciate the importance of maintaining the air route to India. They are not prepared however to sanction any expenditure in connection with the proposed negotiations with the Arab rulers concerned, except on the direct authority of a decision of the Cabinet or ci the Ministerial bub-Gommittee for Questions Concerning the Middle East, and unless they are assured that tne possiole implications of such a decision, as indicated by the Admiraluj,* are fully realised. 11. In view however (l) of the great importance ci maintaining the air route to India, (2) of the extreme improbability of the South Persian route remaining available a tter March 1952, and (3) of the urgency of preparing an alternative without further delay, the Middle hast Official Sub-Committee recommend (a) that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorised immediately to openmmmmm negotiations with the Arab rulers concerned and to endeavour to secure an agreement with ^ one of them^hereby in return for a payment T not exceeding £3000 a year, he and his tribesmen will provide Imperial Airways with the necessary facilities and guarantees* and (b) that the Air Ministry should be authorised to nahe the necessary provisional arrangements forthwith with Imperial Airways for the institution of a service of flying boats _via the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, to be ready to begin operations in March 1932cMinute Paper. £ .'i.h \ )u/*' TV JC ^r-r' . br** &lt;• C. ^ C' ^ ^ y// /. Department. Note on meeting of Middle East Official Sub-Committee 2nd November. The Treasury stated that they would make no difficulty about the subsidy to a limit of £3000 a year, provided that the policy of the civil air route along the Arab shore were first formally endorsed by a Cabinet decision or by the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee before definite instructions were sent to Colonel Biscoe. The Admiralty raised the difficulty of protection. I suggested that this would be very much reduced if Colonel Biscoe obtains an agreement with the Sheikh twd ^he Admiralty agreed. But they suggested that further consideration should be given to the possibility of finding some alternative plan which would avoid- the necessity of a night-stop at Has-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Qaiwain ,and were doubtful whether the First Lord would agree to instructions being sent to Colonel Biscoe meanwhile. It was pointed out how urgent it was that definite authority should be given to Colonei Biscoe to open negotiations with the Sheikhs at once. It was suggested that it might be submitted that the matter should be brought before the Cabinet as a matter of urgency tomorrow. A conclusion in this sense was drafted with a view to empowering Colonel Biscoe to commence negotiations, while other aspects of the problem including that of defence were further considered. The Admiralty were at first prepared to agree to this formula, but subsequently both they and/Paper. • 2*37 Department. and the Colonial Office objected that there was not sufficient time to brief their Ministers before tomorrow. As it was understood that there would not be another Cabinet till next week, the alternative of a recommendation to the Ministerial Sub-Committee ; was considered. Mr. Rendel was inclined to think that the divergent views of the Admiralty and of the rest of the official Sub-Committee should be submitted to the Ministerial Sub-Corrmittee. As this would involve I a meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Corrmittee in order to decide the difference, I suggested that an effort should still be made to reach an agreed conclusion which would satisfy the Admiralty for the time being j while still allowing Colonel Biscoe to go ahead; such an agreed conclusionmigjit be endorsed by the Ministerial Sub-Committee in circulation, thus satisfying the Treasury without its being necessary to wait for a meeting of that Committee.

Formal approval has not, therefore, so far been given to the policy of developing a civil route as such on the Arabian shore,, : 3 o As the Committee are aware, negotiations with Persia for facilities on the Persian shore have been in progress for some time, and appear likely to fall through, especially if we have no alternative route available on the termination of the present agreement with Persia at the end of harch f 1932* It is most necessary to make arrangements as early as possible for the operation of the civil route on the Arab shore and the immediate requirement is authority to make financial arrangements with the local sheikhs. At a later date the question of protection of the ground installations and passenger accommodation may have to be considered also* The first requirement, however, is formal approval j for the policy of making preparations with a view to inaugur ating civil air services on the Arabian littoral next April* and it is suggested thax the M 0 S 0 (0) Committee should re commend, as early as possible, that this approval should be given.

Air Route. o # Every effort will he made to oh tain Persian agreement to continuation of permit to fly south Persian route, as drawbacks of Arab route from both commercial and political points of view are fully recognised. But it is in any case essential, as is realised by Government of India no less than His Majesty s Government, that air communications with India should be maintained, and as it is still uncertain whether Persia will agree to extension of permit it is essential to make preparations in advance for Arab route as second string in case negotiations with Persia fail. Knowledge that Arab route is in course of preparation may quite possibly also make Persians more reasonable if once they realise that we are not dependent on South Persian Route. 3 . Air Ministry ppint out that it is the approved policy of His K-ajesty's Government, after routes have been organised strategically, to arrange wherever possible for them to be kept open by regular civil air lines, e.g. Cairo-Baghdad ana Cairo-Cap^ routes. Development of civil air route along Arabian coast, if forced on us prematurely by Persian intransigence, has at least this compensating advantage. 4. It is contemplated that Imperial Airways would coast route by seaplanes with terminal operate Arabstations at Basra and Karachi.and night-stop at either Res al Kh&amp;imah or Ucmi al Qawain* A'bu Musa which you suggested as alternative for intermediate station has Been considered hut is unsuitable* Facilities (regarding which no special difficulties arise) would he required for refuelling stations at Bahrein and Gwadar and emergency refuelling stations at Koweit, Yas Island and Ormara. Full list of requirements was sent hy air mail of 9 October* At either Ras al Khaimah or Umm al Qawain twu moorings and refuelling harge would he required and Imperial Airways propose to maintain a sloop or hospital harge or some other suitable vessel which would accomodate L passengers and staff and also act as a wireless station and stores depot. Two or three Europeans might he left in charge of this harge. 5 0 Matter has heen carefully considered hy His Majesty's Government after a full discussion -between the India Office, the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry. It is thought that best plan W..11 be that Biscoe should have free hand to negotiate with SheiKhs as soon as possible after his return with a view to securing requisite facilities at either Has al Khaimah or Umm al Qawain by such methods as he finds best, but that he should first try to secure an agreement from Sheihh concerned to provide facilities in return tor •allowances on fairly generous scale so as to overcome opposition of Sheikh's retainers. Air Ministry are taking up with Treasury question of provision of funds for this purpose.

Making the Dutch and French Companies aware that this alternative was being investigated. Bullock asked how the Foreign Office would view an ^unofficial approach by the Company to the Persian Government for renewal of the permit. Rende l replied that t 'To deal directly wit to think the Persians would probably not agree th the Company. They would in any case that the Company had been prompted to act in that way. It would in any case be best to let the French and Dutch make their applications for renewal in the first instance. He could not hold out hope that the Persians would even agree to a temporary extension of Imperial Airways permit. Laithwaite stated that his Department recognised the “importance of finding a solution of the Persian difficulty and agreed with the Foreign Office as to the necessity for a counter in the negotiations. But there were political complications involved in the use of the Arabian coast, and particularly of the Trucial Area, which they were reluctant to face. A skeleton military air route had now been established along the coast, but the considerations affecting a civil air service were different. The Political Residen in his Note had indicated the difficulties and the India Office shared his views with regard to them. The policy a the last 100 years had been to preserve a n ^itl^e peace t and to abstain from internal commitments. derate definite danger of serious incidents arising unless adequate protection were afforded to rest houses and s.ationo established in that area for the air service, and the despatch of troops for purposes of protection would in' a-iffi Itv important change of policy. There is the g^to y that we could not presumably exclude foreigners coast establish an air route, Ou.r position an foreigners is difficult and delicate, and the admission of foreigners would tend to undermine it.

Bullocks enquiry as to whether he considered that money would oil the wheels with the Trucial sheikhs, Mr. Laithv/aite replied that the India Office were advised that small amounts of money in fact went sufficiently far on the Trucial coast. The real difficulty was that these little States were ruled not by the nominal Sheikhs hut by a junta, and that the junta was increasingly suspicious of any British or foreign encroachment, or anything v/hich might lead to an increasingly close control. Air Vice Marshal Burnett pointed out that the military route was vital to the Empire, and that it might be necessary in future to take a stronger line, than hitherto, with the sheikhs. Mr . Laithwaite said that he understood that in the erent of emergency, we could probably immediately reinforce India or the East along the existing military air route. Hr. Laithv/alte pointed out that in return for the degree of protection we at present granted to the Trucial Sheikhs we had secured from them, under treaties, the oldest of which was a century old, undertakings regarding piracy, slavery, gun-running and the control of their foreign relations. This was a not unsubstantial quid pro quo . we could not well add to the obligations imposed by our* treaties save in agreement with the Sheikhs and in return for some further concession. Hr. Mendel asked whether a landing place could not be utilised for the Arabian air service in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who held the tip of the Mazandam peninsula and the eastern extremity of Arabia, and was more dependent on and better disposed to His Majesty’s government than were the Trucial Sheikhs. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that, the authority of the Sultan of Muscat was very weak in Mazandon, where climatic conditions were also most unfavourable. Mr. Bullock, remarked that for a flying boat service the only Sheikh concerned in the Trucial Area appeared to be the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. Mr. Rendel . on the question of the best way of dealing with that ruler, said that we had supported the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah against Persia, whose claim to one of his islands we were firmly resisting on his behalf, and suggested that we were entitled to obtain some concession from him in return. as regards Mi*. Bullock’s question whether something might be done by way of a subsidy, Mr. Rendel thought that if the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was indeed the only obstacle to the establishment of the Arabian air route, it should be possible to after him a price for the use of his lagoon such as he could hardly refuse. A financial inducement might be all the more acceptable at present owing to the serious slump in xhe pearl trade- which had, Mr-. Rendel believed, produced a very serious economic crisis on the Trucial coast.was no 't too eaFiy about the suggestion. Even assuming that we could overcone difficulties with Ra^-al~ Khaimah by bribing him lavishly, there was the danger of making him a target for his jealous neighbours,, He felt too, that there was some risk that a combination of Sheikhs might be formed against us. Mr* _Woods Hump hery suggested that, if it was difficult to ~'*naj.ntain a station on land in connection with the air service, it might be possible for his Company to make use of a steam yacht, like their present ’’Imperia' which is stationed off Crete, both as a W/T station and as a rest house for passengers en route. Air Vjo e Mars hal Burnett enquired what the attitude would be to'”an application by the French and Dutch to operate ever the Arabian route once it was established. M r. Ren del remarked that our position in Arabia was peculiar in that, unlike the position in Iraq and Palestine, we were not tied by international obligation to give facilities to other nations* Our usual policy was, however, in such a case to accord privileges in order that we might ourselves demand others in return. Mr o Lai thwait e r of erred to our obligations in the event of a foreign aeroplane crashing in the hinterland or along the Trucial coast. We could hardly well refuse to accord assistance, and very awkward political complications might ensue. In any case, it had been our consistent policy to exclude foreigners and we remained anxious to keep this area a British preserve so far as possible, even in present day conditions. Mr. Bu llock observed that the Air Ministry view was that only flying boats should be operated along the Arabian coast at present. Mr^ Woods Hum phe ry remarked on the question of cost that operation of the service in the Persian Gulf by flying boat would involve his Company in additional expenditure, resulting from the change necessitated in their fleet and the greater distance to be flown* Mr 0 Bertram enquired whether, in the event of withdrawal oi the Persian permit, it would be possible for us to take retaliatory action in Iraq with regard to the Persian- Junkers service to Baghdad. M r. Rende l replied that it would be impossible to take retaliatory action against the Per sian--Junkers service in Iraq, owing to the no-discrimination provisions of the Anglo—Iraq Treaty, which the League ol Nations would ^ certainly insist on seeing continued after xraq s admission to the League.* Mr, Bu lior.k said that the next step seemed to be to bring the matter before the Cabinet, He would propose this course to the Secretary of State and have an Air Ministry memorandum prepared on the question. This would be circulated to the other Departments concerned, who 7 /ould thus have fu.i.^ opportunity of bringing their views before the Cabine •DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT secret. ■v ANNEXURE II.

(A) —The Present Situation. 1 I FEEL it necessary to bring before the Cabinet as a matter of urgency thp very difficult situation which has arisen vis-a-vis Persia in connection wi the Indian Air Service.

It has. however,^ with them would be likely to hinder ra e ^ k the French and Dutch - u been agreed that Imperial Airways can 11 -Tid unofficially and enquire o&gt; them Transport Companies concerned informally and [5769] [6130]2 what they propose doing, which may lead to some move on their part. Thismav or may not in due course clarify the situation but time presses, and it is the vie, of the Foreign Oflice that, even if the french and Dutch peimits are extended it is possible if not probable, that the Persians will refuse a similar extension to ourselves, and that, if they do so, we shall have no remedy even in the teeth oil such glaring discrimination against Great Britain, m view of I ersia s failure to ratify the Air Traffic Convention. We appear, in short, to be in a state of complete impotence vis-a-vis Persia 5 . If a satisfactory alternative route were available the matter would, perhaps not be of very great moment. 7 he trouble is that there is no satisfactory alternative. The route through Central Persia has just been surveyed by a representative of Imperial Airways, and unfortunately his report is definitely adverse. He advises that it is impracticable, owing primarily to (a) the height of the mountains to be traversed and {b) the unsuitability of the route for operation in winter, whilst (c) it appears that it would be very costly to transport supplies of petrol to the necessary aerodromes. He states that Sir R Clive expressed the view that the route was ‘ ‘ preposterous,” crossing as it does high mountain ranges, entailing flight at an altitude of 13,000 feet winter and summer, and generally operation over a terrain so rough that for stretches hundreds of miles in extent there is no possibility of a safe forced landing. Nor are there any telegraphic communications available. He further reports that the head of the Persian Air Force frankly admitted to him that the route was impossible for commercial operation, and undertook to say as much to the Persian authorities. He adds that he is satisfied (and Sir R. Clive confirms) that there is no practicable alternative route across Central Persia. Lest the point be queried, I had, perhaps, better explain that the Junkers services at present in operation in Persia do not fly over this route, and that they are, in any event, able to use for their limited operations a much smaller and lighter type of aircraft which can land in a restricted space. Even so, these services suffer from great irregularity, particularly in the winter, when engines are liable to freeze up, and a machine, once on the ground, has great difficulty in getting into the air again. 6 . The only other route lies along the Arabian coast of the Gulf, which is for the most part barren, inhospitable and uncivilised. The terrain is more difficult and the climate is reported to be hotter in summer than on the Persian side, and generally there is, (except perhaps at Bahrein), a lack of facilities and amenities for civilian passengers, which could, however, be remedied without much difficulty. This route is at present in process of being opened up by the Royal Air Force for strategic purposes, but it is not yet fully organised, and even here potential obstacles have been encountered in the shape of opposition by at least one petty Arab potentate—the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. If Imperial Airways are compelled to use this route along the Arabian coast, it will mean, I fear, a slowing down of their existing time-table to India, witn consequent loss of traffic, and it will almost certainly be necessary to operate this section by flying boats, instead of by landplanes as at present, which will entail increased expense. 7. Nevertheless, in the impasse in which we find ourselves, I see no alter native, if the Foreign Office view be accepted, but to press on with the organisation of this latter route, which will take several months to prepare. But here ve are faced with a new complication. The India Office, whilst fully recognising than is essential to find some solution which will permit of the continued opera ion the Indian service, are of the opinion that there are serious political objec io to the use of this Arabian route for regular civil purposes. The difficulty g primarily in that section which runs through the territory of the Trucial i The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is also opposed to the use °f fb ls and stresses the fact that these Chiefs have always looked askance at the .® v | a ment of an air route through their territory, objecting in particular to the i e civil air service. The India Office point out that our policy has c 01 PP t( l n to abstain from any commitments by land in the territory of these Chie s. ^ are advised that if a civil air route is put into operation it would P r ° ^ necessary to station troops in the areas affected for the protection ot tne ^ This would represent a very important change of policy and might a, • consequences. Failing such protection, it would be impossible to reaC ntee the safety of the rest-house or refuelling point, and there would be the T - ‘il Coast is a delicate one, ana inai witn me esiaoiisnmeiiL oi a civu an ^ it would be impossible to maintain our present policy of excluding ™ U • ners or even, presumably, foreign aircraft. This is in their view an 101 ortant consideration, especially as their advent would involve great additional of incidents and of the consequent necessity of armed British intervention fnr the protection of such foreigners. The India Office would therefore favour a further effort being made to secure an pxtension from the Persians. . Quite clearlv great weight must attach to the India Office view m this matter, hut I would stress that, if the service is operated (as is proposed) by flying boats a would onlv be necessary to have one intermediate landing place on the Trueial rmst viz. at Ras-al-Knaimah or alternatively at Umm-al-Kaiwam, 25 miles f 1}^’ South which offers superior facilities for flying boats, but so far has not hPPn o-enerallv used by the Royal Air Force, owing to the British agent being established at Ras-ai-Khaimah. Unfortunately, the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has been one of the most strenuous objectors to the opening up even of a military air r oute, though his attitude has been one of “ passive resistance and aircraft of the Roval Air Force have in fact made frequent use of his territory. I should hnnp therefore though I hesitate to express too definite an opinion on the point, that it might be possible to hold out to him some relatively small financial induce ment whil would cause him to modify his present attitude I am further advised bv senior officers of the Royal Air Force with first-hand knowledge of loc mj situation that in their view, (which, however, is not shared by the Political 'Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is responsible for our relations with the Sheikhs in question), there is little danger of serious trouble, if we are prepared to tTelVTlme Further, it might be possible to have as rest-house a small shallow-draught vessel such as those already successfully employed for this mmnose bv^Imperfal Airways in the Mediterranean, which could be moored at the place selected; and in this event the Air Staff, as at that troops would not be required for its protection, connexion I (which could be provided at neghg.b e ^ may perhaps remind my colleagues that, afte frn ^o Pr | t-w a military air by an authoritative Committee, it has been fully route along the Arabian coast of the Culf is a v jpfiSnp strategic value.

Recommendations for Action. 8 . In sum then, the situation as regards the only three alternative routes is as follows : ) Persian Coastal Route. nneration is undoubtedly far This route, which is that P re ^? ? f ety operational convenience *eferable to any other on grounds a • i a i/ways to operate along the id expense. The present permit to I P , March, 1932, and the Foreign ersian coast expires, however on t e h • inion there is virtually no hope ffice have repeatedly advised that P p ers i a ’s original warning, ? an extension. They are further, in view 014 O' when granting the concession, oi her subsequent attitude, and of the fact that she has never ratified the International Air Tiaffic Convention, averse from approaching the Persians with a request of this nature, which particularly in the absence of any lever on our side, would be certain to be refused. ^ (b) Central Persian Route. The route through Central Persia prescribed by the Persian Government has been surveyed and reported on as commercially and operationally impracticable, and there appears to be no other inland route possible. (c) The Arabian Coast Route. This appears feasible, if satisfactory arrangements can be come to with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Kaiwain, but to open it up may entail, in the opinion of the India Office, serious political drawbacks, whilst it is longer, on the whole, more difficult of operation, less comfortable foi passengers and definitely more costly. 9 . With these conflicting considerations and the divergent views held by the Foreign Office and the India Office, it is very difficult for me to present to my colleagues any clear-cut recommendation. 1 presume it can be premised that somehow or other the continued operation of this route must be secured; to abandon the Indian service—a service which is bound to grow steadily in importance with the passage of time—is, in my view, unthinkable, and would react on our prestige throughout the whole of the East. If this situation is to be avoided, some action must be taken and taken immediately. The question is what that action should be, and it is on this that I am anxious to take counsel with my colleagues as a matter of urgency. My own tentative recommendations are as under :— ( 1 ) If it is not possible to take further diplomatic action with Persia at the present juncture through official channels for an extension of the present permit on a firm basis, then arrangements should be made for Imperial Airways to approach the Persian Government forthwith as a matter of ordinary commercial negotiation. It seems incumbent upon us to notify the Persian Government that a careful survey has now shown the Central Persian route to be impracticable, and. in doing so, it would appear natural and inevitable to ask for a continuance of facilities to use the coastal route. I may say that I have taken steps to secure informally the advice of Sir John Cadman on the advisability of such negotiations, in view of his intimate knowledge of present conditions in Persia. He definitely recommends such action, and has intimated that the Anglo-Persian Company will give all possible assistance to Imperial Airways, though it cannot actually negotiate on their behalf. I would emphasise, however, that, in the light of the advice tendered by the Foreign Office, I am none too hopeful of the result of these unofficial negotiations, which are likely in any event to drag on for several months. ( 2 ) Whatever action may be taken under ( 1 ) I consider that we ought forth with to take all preliminary action for the organisation of the Arabian coast route—a course advocated by our Minister at Tehran and the Foreign Office since July 1930—despite its admitted draw backs from the political and other aspects. It will take several months to organise, and we simply cannot afford to wait on the results oi further negotiations with the Persians, whether official or unqmcia^ I should add that the Foreign Office incline to the view that signs o activity on our part on the Arabian side may just possibly produce a more accommodating frame of mind in the Persian authorities. (Initialled) ^ A ir Ministry, July 23, 1931. oAiT'TSXur;i'i m. At the 40th meeting of the Cabinet held on 50th July, 1951, the following conclusion was arrived at on the question of the threatened interruption of the England-India Air Service ■between Basrah .and Karachi. The Cabinet agreed:- That the Secretary of otate for Foreign Affairs should reopen negotiations with the Persian Govern ment, with a view to an extension of the route along the northern (or eastern) side of the Gulf, using as a lever the possible reopening of the Dusdab railway* (Cabinet 40 (31) Conclusion 5)o(?3&gt; MHEJURK t 4* Private Letter from Lord Amulree, Secretary of State for Air to Sir Saanuei.

(Circulated with Lord Amulree T s permission).. 28th September, 1931 X Ky dear Secretary of State, In July last I circulated a paper ~ CoP. 183(31) - on the threatened interruption of the England - India Air Service between Basra and Karachi. As you may remember the present permit to Imperial Airways to operate along the Persian coast expires on the 31st March next; and the Foreign Office have repeatedly advised that in their opinion there is virtually no hope of the existing concession being extended beyond that date. The Persians have suggested an alternative route through Central Persia; but this has been suiveyed by a representative of Imperial Airways and found to be quite impracticable. Accordingly, in the paper above quoted, I proposed to the Cabinet that we should proceed forthwith vaoh toe preliminary steps necessary to orgtuu-ae a flying o.,at ,.outo along the Arabian coast, that ie to say the, southern sho.e the Gulf. Such a route would have certain disadvantages as being more difficult of operation, less comfortable ^or passengers, and more costly than the present route along the northern shore of the Gulf, as seaplanes w^u.-d ha.e used and the route is longer; but at the time there seamed to be no practicable alternative, and I therefore put my proposal to the Cabinet, pointing out that the India Office nop of this route was open to unfortunately considered that the ° serious political objection. -i- n:-ii- ZCli At the last moment a way out of the difficulty suggested itself simultaneously to the Foreign Office and to rii y advisers here - viz. to meet the Persian request for the reopening of the Duzdap Railway in return for the extension of the concession to Imperial Airways. This was agreed to by all the Departments concerned and approved by. the Cabinet- at their meeting on July 3Cth. Since then negotiations have been proceeding on these lines through the legation at Tehran. According to the last reports from Tehran the Persians are maintaining their refusal to extend the concession beyond Inarch next j and it is therefore a question of getting to work on an alternative route with the smallest possible delay. So far as the Air Ministry is concerned, the Arabian coast route is the only practicable alternative, but to this, as I say, the India Office see objection on political grounds. I do not v.ant in any v.ay to minimise the importance of the political considerations advanced by your advisers, but confess to some doubt as to whether the Political Resident may perhaps not have overstressed the element of risk. Imperial Airways are prepared to use a boat as a Rest House if necessary, and the Air Force will undertake to prevent, so far as they can, the occurrence of . , + Thp country is backward and under any unfortunate incidents, - 1 - ne ^ the control of a few small Sheikhs living largely on slave labour. The operation of a civil air route (m addition to the military air route which it has been agreed indispensable! would, I should have thought, civilise and bring prosperity to the inhabitants, whilst a trifling sum of money might smooth away the objectio Of any of these Sheikhs to the use of some of their harbours by the flying boats of Imperial airways.-'111'- (26*r i£ T / cn, however, if the organisation of a route along this coast is not altogether free fro^n political objection, is it not better than the complete cessation of the Kng-Lanh *' I_ai achi ^eivice beyond Basra? For let it be clearly understood if the Persians will not extend their concession to Inperial Airways end Imperial Airways are not allowed to use the Arabian coast, this great link in cur Imperial air communications; in the inauguration of which you yourself played so important a part, will be severed definitely at the Persian border. As I said in my paper.-, this seems to m© unthinkable» I should perhaps add that your predecessor suggested in two Cabinet papers which he also circulated in July (C/'P.. (31) 192 and 196) that Imperial Airways might use another route through Persian territory, or, if they flew along the Persian Gulf, might use the Island cf Abu Lias a as a base, neither of these alternatives is, unfortunately, practicable. Imperial Airways are satisfied that, even if the route were commercially practicable on other ways, wnich it is not, they could not maintain the regularity necessary on a trunk line service if they had to fly over the leisi^n mountains in winter, and this view is confirmed by Royal Air Force officers who have had to fly during winter m those regions . It is quite a different matter for the Junkers Company 3 operating a local service over a portion of cL« route with rae.ll machines, though even they find considerable difficulty and can, I understand, only maintain an approximate regularity in winter time, cj ta^in^ i ~^ku.. and having forced, lendings which would not be .iustniaole for Imperial Airways with larger airoralc. As to Abu Idas a, I have ascertained from two cl my officers who have flown over it on various occ's'oAs m h Z6S it is not practicable as a permanent refuelling depot, although a flying boat might find temporary shelter there if forced to come dov»n. I would repeat, therefore, that if Imperial Airways cannot be allowed to make use of the Arabian coast route, as proposed in the paper I circulated to the Cabinet in July, there will be no alternative but to close down the service beyond Iraq; and I think you will agree with me that this is a position we cannot accept, even if the operations of the route involves the modification of a long established local policy- I know how busy you are, and only trouble you with this because of your close personal interest in the matter. Further discussion on the Departmental level will, I fear, be fruitless: but if you would like to talk things over with me I am at your disposal- You know how long it takes to organise an air route: we now have a bare six months left before Imperial Airways’ concession in Persia runs out- It is most urgent therefore, that we should obtain your concurrence to start work on the Arabian coast at a very early date- Yours sincerely, (Signed) AIULREE, Ine Rt- Hon - Sir Samuel Hoare, Bto, G a B*Eo, C t&gt;M.&amp; Gp, INDIA OFFICF, ; King Charles Street, S uIo -iv b ilINDI/ In any is subject, A&gt;lease quote i/W hi by natnJ,I but to— P.Z. 6788 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to /fe y* and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop/tf of the under-mentioned paper.

(Tehran), 24th October, 1931. 24th October, 1931. 25th October, 1931, Perusal of recent correspondence regarding Henjam, Imperial Airways and Duadap leads me to submit that air question should be taken up as isolated issue both here (if possible with the Shah) and with Minister of Court in London (I understand he is actually in Paris). Time is essential factor but it would be useless to press matter here unless you were prepared simultc-neous - ly to tackle Minister of Court and convince him that His Majesty's Government are not prepared to pay any price for even short maintenance of present route. On his retium Minister of Court's hands will probably be full with Russian negotiations which seem to have reached deadlock and general stocktaking of his personal position necessitated by 3 monthu absence so that it would be virtually impossible for me to get him to concentrate on a question with regard u o which would think that he gained rather than lost by pro crastination. I should like you to tell him that for obvious technical and administrative reasons ^mperia^ Aii ay must know definitely hy say November 30th whether prolongation is agreed in principle and that mustmu^t be settled by December 31st. Falling definite agreement by that date other arrangements would be put in hand either to use route along West Coast if tribal chiefs proved on enquiry to be less averse to modem progress than Persian Government or for partial substitution of steamships for aeroplanes through the Gulf. This decision if taken would : &gt;t be lightly reversed. With regard to the Shah I would hold simiiar language. I understand there are some grounds for believing that he is determined not to renew the agreement, regarding it as a potential menace to Persian sovereign rights. Minister of Court T s demec^ci in the face of categorical representations would probably give better information on this point than 1 can obtain here and he is the only person who may be able to alter the Shah ! s mind. On the other hand if the Shah’s mind is definitely made up desirability of early decision regarding our future course of action is enhanced. I understand we have no effective bargaining counters though Duzdap Railway might be useful for improving terms of settlement if principle o± se^t ment had been accepted. I hope to present credentials abouu November 2*xd.

The draft telegram has been held up, and I have discussed the position with Mr.BallocA. It would, as he says, seem inappropriate that the main question should he referred to the official Committee after the course proposed has been approved by the Ministers principally concerned, and it had not occurred to me (it having been decided that reference to the Cabinet was unnecessary) that reference to the other Ministers on the Ministerial Committee (the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Secretaries of State for War aid the Dominions, and First Lord of the Admiralty, I thinx)was desirable before orders were finally issued. Mr.Bullock is however proposing that the subsidiary question of the measures to be ta^en to protect the air route should be brought before the official Middle Bast Committee at a meeting to be convened very shortly, and he thinks that if the position in regard to the main cpestion is then explained, the Treasury - and presumably the other Departments represented on the Committee will be satisfied, and that the way will then be clear for the sending of final instructions, including authority for expenditure. In the circumstances the best course seems to be to hold up the draft telegram penaing the proposed meeting. It is to be hope a that delay will be very short, and in any ca^e Colonel Biscoe could not proceeu very far until he knows where he stands as regards expenditure.-r e3 : T P A //A 27th October, 1931. ]&gt;9ar Wak.cly* X am much obliged to you for your letter of the 19th October, which has been put before me on my return from a few days' leave.

As regards the question of the amount of money to be scent by way of subsidy, I have asked the Treasury to authorise expenditure within a maximum of £3,000, but I still very much hope that this full sum will not be required. I quite agree that the parallel at Aden is not exact - it was this I had in mind in saying in my letter of the 14th October that 'the circumstances in Aden and on the Trucial coast are not altogether comparable' - but the parallel is perhaps rather closer than you have appreciated, and I ought to have mentioned in my earlier letter that the Aden sheikhs in question also undertake responsibilities in the matter of aerodromes and landing grounds in return for the subsidies they receive. Moreover, there are parallels elsewhere. For Iraq there is a sheikh who was subsidised to the extent of £450 per annum in order to ensure his carrying out certain others the upkeep of a landing ground though I realise th the position of the Trucial coast sheikhs is somewhat peculiar, there is no doubt that in other areas too a sheikh receiving a subsidy has to disburse a substantial proportion of i or important retainers.

I circulate for the informat ion of my colleagues a note on the present position in regard to the Basra-Karachi section of the civil air route to India together with copy of telegrams exchanged with the Government of India on the aih^ect. The permit which Imperial Airways Limited obtai ned for three years from the Persian Government to fly along the south coast of Persia expires on 31st March iy3£* The c Persian Government have refused to grant a renewal and have failed to offer any practicafl^al ternative route through Persia. As it is obviously essential that imperial air communications should be maint ained this attitude of the / Persian Government has confronted us with a problem of some urgency and difficulty* Xt was aeciaed on the 30th July last that negotiations should be reopened with the Persian Government for a renewal of the permit to fly the south Persia route V. t uo v ^V)0 j T cl b0 US6CI iit S- the Duzaap railway sno -±^ lever; the train service on this railway had' been closed down by the Government of India last June us a result of the obstructive attitude of the local Persian authorities, anu the Persian Government in July had as^ed that it should he reopened. The British Charge' d’Affaires at Tehran accordingly, at the beginning of August, informed the Persian Government that His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of Inaia were prepared to consider the ^eopening of the railway for a period of, say, five years, if the Persian Government would meet them in a similar manner by granting an extension of Imperial Airways’ permit for the same period. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to bring the question before the Persian Government and urge the case for an extension. Ho reply, however, has yet been received, and it has consequently become a matter of great urgency to provide an alternative for the Persian section of the Air route to India, in case (as seems too lively) all efforts to secure an extension of the present permit from the Persian Government prove unsuccessful. I therefore/already 'been developed as a stiategic route for military aircraft. Has-al- Khaimah marks one of the stages on the military route, and a fuel barge has already been established there after considerable difficulty resulting from the opposition of the Shei&amp;h of that place. Imperial Airways would require to maintain at Ras-al-^haimah, or alternatively Umm-al-Qawain, in addition to moorings ana refuelling facilities, some suitable vessel as a house-boat to accommodate passengers and staff and to act as a wireless station and stores depot. It is anticipated that the opposition of the Sheikh and inhabitants of the place selected will be greater in the case of the civil air route (with the more elaborate organisation and frequent visits rtiich it involves) than that which has already been experienced in the case of the military route. It is hoped, however, that it will be possible to overcome these difficulties and to secure adequate guarantees for the safety of the establishment by negotiating an agreement with the Sheikh by which he would receive an annual subsidy and in return grant the reqiired facilities and undertake responsibility for safety and possibly the provision ofDepartment. native guards. It is obviously essential that all precautions should be ta^en in advance agairst the risics that would otherwise be involved in the establishment of the rest-house among these independent i and|potentially hostile Arabs. The best method of providing for it s safety would be an agreement with the I SheiAh, and though this involves a certain amount of expenditure it is surer and cheaper than any other method. It is intended to give i Colonel Biscoe, the Political !

It may be necessary to provide monetary inducement for as many as 200 persons; but, even so, the total disbursement necessary will probably not be large. The question of expenditure is being ta^en up by the Air Ministry with the Treasury. About £3,000 a year has been suggested by the India Office as an estimate, not of the actual cost, but of the maximum limit to which we should be prepared to go ; if necessary; it is possible that we may secure the desired agreement more cheaply than this, but it is desirable that °olonel Biscoe should have a sufficient margin in hand to avoid any risx of his negotations being held up, perhaps at a critical moment, by the necessity of applying for further sanction. As soon as the maximum figure has been settled, supplementary instructions will be sent to Colonel Biscoe.

It is impossible in advance to form a close estimate of the amount that will actually be required, but we have discussed the matter again with Biscoe, and in'favour of a limit of not less than £3,000 he points to the following considerations. There is a general and strong objection among the Trucial Coast Araljjs to the advent of the civil air route , and it would take a good deal to overcome it. The objection is very much stronger than it was to the military air route, because a regular civil air route, involving as it does regular visits and more organisation, is regarded by the Arabs as a far more serious threat to their independence. In the second place, the money net all go to the Pheikh, who is not an c absolute ruler but merely the representative of the ruling clan. It Tould have to be divided in varying proportions among a large number of relatives, possibly amounting to 200 persons/Department* persons. A third point is that the money is not simply in the nature of a bribe but also of payment for value received. Biscoe hopes to enter into an agreement which would secure the good will of the Sheikh and by which in return for the allowance he would undertake certain responsibilities; these might even extend to the payment by him of native guards. Lastly, Bisc.oe suggests that the sum involved is trifling compared with the cost of any permanent measures of protection, such as stationing troops, which might otherwise be necessary. Perhaps you will find some of the above arguments useful m explaining the matter to the Treasury. As regards the question of protection r we agree that it is sufficient for the moment to let the G. of I. know that they are not asked to accept responsibility. At the same time we agree as the necessity of an exhaustive examination of the ways and means of affording protection. e shall be very glad to be kept in touch with/’s with the progress of this examination and to do anything possible to assist in solving the problem; it i? possible that points may arise on which Biscoe advice would be useful. As we see the matter at present, there are various contingencies, more or less remote, under the head of protection, which have to be provided against, e.g., - an extreme hypothesis - there is a possibility mentioned by th~ G. of I. of the Trucial Q heikhs uniting against us and seeking assistance from Ibn Baud. This extreme case might^-1 suppose, inveive an oporo'tior- on r small no ale. Then there is the contingency (which we hope will also be remote if Biscoe’s negotiations are successful) of some sort of .interference or sabotage, or cf an actual attack ; by the local Arabs at the place selected for the houseboat. Lastly (more serious than the latter and not altogether improbable) there is the risk that the local Sheikh, with all the good will in the world, may not be able to protect the establishment or the passengers on the houseboat from a raid by neighbouring Arabs living, outside his own jurisdiction - e.g., the Ghihu tribe, living, in the mountains of theDraft Paper.

When dictating my letter of yesterday I thought it would be interesting to get such figures as I could as to any subsidies we may be paying to minor Arab sheikhs elsewhere than in the Gulf. I accordingly called for particulars but only received them too late for incorpor ation in my letter. X now send you a list of the subsidies we ' understand to be paid to various sheikhs at Aden. These seem to me to confirm my impression that £3 000 for a very minor potentate in the Persian Gulf is an’unduly large figure. X draw your particular attention to the fact that the sultan of Lahej (Sir Abdul Karim bin PADH1 who is entitled to a salute of 11 guns and has 15,000 subiects (being in fact the most important sheikh of the Aden Protectorate), receives only £974 a year exclusive of sums payable in respect of definite water and salt rights acquired from him. The largest figure payable to any other sheikh is £360- I do not suggest that the circumstances in xkden and on the Trucial coast are altogether comparable, but I L.D. lakely, Esq.., C.B., India office, Whitehall, S.W.l. think/think they are sufficiently similar to constitute a rough indication of what we ought to consider paying by way of allowanco. Perhaps yoa would be good enough to pass this information on to Biscoe. Yours sincerely.ADEN.

Dear Wakely, Thank you for your letter of the 9th October enclosing a brief summary of the conclusions reached at the meeting held at the India Office last Wednesday about the air route to India, together with a draft telegram for despatch to the Government of India on the subject. I have no remarks to make on the brief summary, but there are one or two points on which I should be obliged if you would slightly modify the draft telegram. These are as follows ( 1 ) i cannot, of course, commit the Air Ministry to any payment to the sheikh concerned without Treasury sanction. This I will endeavour to obtain as a matter of urgency, and I should hope that we should be able to telegraph instructions on the point to Biscoe in ample time. For the moment I suggest you should substitute for the sentence on the last page of the telegram dealing with this point, the following :~ M Air Ministry are taking up with Treasury question of provision of funds for this purpose’ • Here I ought to say that,though I speak with all the diffidence of the layman, a sum of £3,000 appears to me prima facie quite out of scale, even as a maximum. It is equivalent, after all, to something like 40.000 rupees, and surely this is on the lavisn side, though I fully agree that the allowances should (as the telegram suggests) be on a fairly generous scale**. (o\ As regards paragraph 5, I am afraid we cannot commit ourselves to a categorical statement that we can undertake responsibility for the 1 Airways establishments. Clearly wa ^ . t ‘ + affording protection and preventing unfortunate incidents will require exhaustive examination. However, surely what is wanted at this stage more than anything else is ^h^hlHhey ar^not* 1 clear to the Government of India that th§£ are noi asked to accept responsibility for ^necessary protection, and I suggest this paragraph might be re—cast accordingly* : !{ -vT It: /(3) L*D, Wakely, Esq., C.B., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. \*A ( 3 ) Lastly, we should much like to see some ^ insertion on the lines I suggested at the end of our meeting the other day. Since the point was (as I understood from our subsequent conversation) not clear to you, I feel pretty certain it will not have been appreciated by the Government of India - and to us it appears a point of considerable substance. It is approved policy that the Royal Air Force, in opening up Imperial strategic air routes, H blazes the trail' (so to say), and that thereafter^wherever possible,they are turned over to civil air transport and thereby kept open at a minimum cost. This is what we have done in the case of the Cairo-Baghdad and Cairo-Cape services. The Royal Air Force no longer operates regularly between Cairo and Baghdad and we contemplate before long substituting for the annual service flights made of recent years between Cairo and the Cape, flights to Nigeria and West Africa generally, which again we hope will in due course prove to have been the precursors of a regular civil service. This policy is indeed one of the main justifications for the subsidising of civil air trans port, and for that reason the Cabinet Committee which went into this question in 1927 included the following passage in their report 2 - 'We find that the natural commercial routes to India and beyond and to South Africa are virtually conincident with the great strategic lines of air communication which are essential if our Imperial air forces are to possess the full mobility which is required for their economical disposition at selected centres, whence they will ultimately be able to reinforce any threatened point with a minimum of delay. If it is necessary on strategic grounds that we should possess and maintain available for instant use a long chain of aerodromes between the different points of the Empire, it is clearly better that they should not lie fallow against emergency, but be put to profitable use in time of peace'. The opening up of the Arabian coast route to civil air transport is therefore from this angle natural development to be looked for in the future; it has merely been forced upon us before its due time by circumstances over which we have no control. I think the point could be dealt with by some such insertion as the following wherever you think most suitable 3 ^ir Ministry point out that it is the approved policy of His Majesty’s Government, after routes have been organised strategically?to arrange wherever possible for them to he kept open by regular civil air lines, e,g.

Their insistence on the difficulties of the Arab route has been due to anxiety that every possibility on the Persian side should be explored and that in facing the difficulties of tne Arab side we should not make the mistake of under rating them. ^ince in their last telegram on the subject (of 25 July, flagged F) the G. of I. stated that if recourseHiflute Paper.

J?2 Summary of conclusions of meeting at the Indja Office on 7th October 19 31 regarding the air route to India. 35a 3000 5 31 At the meeting with the Air Ministry and F.O. it was agreed that though the Arab coast route is from every point of view a bad pis aller, it is necessary to put in hand at once preparations for its establishment so that it may be ready by the end of March in case failure of the negotiations with Persia maices it necessary to fall back on this route. The F.Q. agreed that active preparation might also be expected to help to bring the Persians to a more reasonable frame of mind, since they would realise that we are not dependent on the south Persian route. The quest! on was discussed whether when 'the Arab route is established it would be desirable, if possible, to exclude foreign aircraft. It was pointed out that it is undesirable to depart further than is necessary item the traditional policy cf excluding foreign influence from the Arab States, am also that in practice we should have to tame the responsibility for dealing with incidents which might result from the presence of foreign aircraft. The P.O. were doubtful of the expediency of excluding foreigners. It was agreed that this question could be considered later. It was agreed that Col.Biscoe should visit the Trucial Coast as soon as possible, sna that it would be desirable to give him a free hana m negotiation with the Sheikhs. Imperial Airways will require an intermediate stati on for a night stop/Stop at either Has al Khaimah or Umm al Qawain, with a vessel for accommodation of passengeis and S-c^fi. It was thought that this vessel should he placed in charge of two or three Europeans, agreement with the Sheikh at one of the alternative inducement to satisfy the Sheikh and his retainers. The Air Ministry would prohahly he able to supply sufficient funds for this purpose. the question of the south Persian route, using as a peg the transmission to them of a report hy Mr.Travers on t the impracticability of the central Persian route. The offer to transfer the Persian section of the Duzdap Railway to Persia as well as the offer, already made, to recommence the running of trains on this secti on, would he used at an appropriate opportunity. Col.Biscoe would first try to secure an places mentioned hy offering sufficient monetary The F.O. will remind the Persian Govt, ofm praft Paper. 5l 55 5000 2.31 Department.

Every effort will be made to obtain Persian agreement to continuation of permit to fly south Persian route, as drawbacks of Arab route from both commercial and political points of view are generally recognised^ But it is in any case essential, as is realised by G. of I. no less than H.M.G., that 1sr communications with India A should be maintained ; and as it is still uncertain whether Persia will agree to extension of permit it is necessary to make preparations in advance for Arab route as second string in case negotiations with Persia fail^ Knowledge that Arab route is in course of preparation may also help to make Persians more reasonable by shewing them that we are not dependent on South Persian route. 3. It is contemplated that Imperial Airways would operate Arab coast route by seaplanes with terminal stations at Basra and Karachi and vyj-ght-stop at either Has/IDraft Paper, C 5000 2.31 Has al Khaim ah or Umm al Qawair\^ Ahu Musa which you suggested as alternative for intermediate station has been considered but is / unsuitable^ Facilities regarding which no special difficulties arise &gt; would be required for refuelling stations at Koweit, Yas Island and dmara^ Full list of requirements was sent by7mail of % October^ At either Has al Khaimah or Umm al Qawain two moorings and refuelling barge would be required and Imperial Airways propose to maintain a sloop or hospital barge or some other suitable vessel which would j accommodate passengers and staff and also act as a wireless station and storey depot^ Two or three Europeans wight he left in charge of this barge. 4. Matter has been carefully considered by H.M.G.5 It is thought that best plan will be that Biscoe should have free hand to negotiate with Sheikhs as soon as possible after his return with a view to securing requisite facilities at either Ras al Khaimah or Itam al CJawain by such methods as he finds best, but that he should first try to secure an agreement from/ Vpr&amp;ft Pap er&lt; rv Department. from Sheikh concerned to provide facilities in return for allowances on fairly generous scale so as to overcome opposition of Sheikh 1 s retainers^ Air Ministry would be prepared to provide funds within reason and subiect to maximum of say £3000 per annum. 5. Air Ministry consider that R.A.F. which is already operating military route could undertake responsibility for protection of Imperial Airways establishments and so far as possible prevention of unfortunate incidents. 6.

Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Delhi.present ^ Air Ministry : aPABIAIT coast route 1 On the assumption that Imperial Airways would be obliged to operate the Arabian Coast route between Basra and Karachi with' Seaplanes, it was agreed that Basra and Karachi would have to be equipped as terminal stations, Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Qaiwain would be the main stopping places at which passengers would spend the night. Bahrein and Gwadar would be refuelling stations and Koweit, Yas Island and Ormara would be emergency refuelling stations. 2 Three Flying Boats would be required for the operation of the service, but it might perhaps be /Ineeoooary to start operation with two only making use of the two Calcuttas released from the North African service when that route is operated by land planes instead of by seaplanes. Alternatively Imperial Airways might have to ask the Royal Air Force for the loan of service Calcuttas, in this event Imperial Airways would propose temporarily to carry mails only and not passengers. 3, It was agreed that the following ground organisation would be required along the route Slipways and Karachi; it might be possible to get the Indian Government to provide this slipway.

In their despatch No.520 of 10th September^ as no reply h^ been received from the Persian Government, the F.O. asked Mr.bodd to consider what steps could be taken to ascertain from the Persian Government the result consideration of the question of extending Imperial Airways'permit. He replied by telegram onjlinute Paper. Department. fy 0 0n alSt September that a direct enquiry would merely elicit a refusal. He suggested however that an approach might be made to the question in the following manner; no formal notification has yet been made to the Persian Government that the central Persia route offered by them has been found impracticable; Mr.Dodd suggests that he should communicate on behalf of Imperial Airways to the Persian Government a report by Mr.Travers (the pilot who examined the route) and should make this a peg for enquiring what alternative they have to offer and press them for an urgent reply; he suggests that Mr.Travers 1 existing report should be altered and amplified for this purpose. The French Minister was recently instructed by Li* 4 ft 7^ 5 M.P.A. as to the prospect of an extension of the French It appears that the M.F.A. stated that the Persian Government did not propose to renew Imperial Airways cm&amp;e’&amp;a’fe-n and that they would be unable to renew the contracts of the French and Dutch lines M the 3lst March 1932 'since H.M.G. Could in that case claim m.f.n. treatment”. The Dutch Minister has also spoken to the M.F.A. and has been informed that there would be no objection to an extension of the Dutch (imwswi** till that of Imperial Airways expires but that *» M no more than this could be promised. I understand from the F.O. that the reason why they were previously diverse to the idea of joint representations by the British, French and Dutch Governments was that ^ since the French and Dut expired three months earlier than ours they thought it better tactics to wait till the French and -first move and we knew what Dutch Governments made the attitude/ 5000 5/30jlinute Paper. Department. attitude the Persian Government adopted towards them. As these moves have now been made / it seems desirable to consider again the question of joint representations and I understand that the P.O. will consider this and let us know their views at the meeting next week. In reporting i Mr.Dodd stated that he found it difficult to suggest the oest tactics to pursue in regard to our own esoxscww&amp;r&amp;n S ^ -VAi MUkHj 1 ft '■‘O Ak )IL, A A ^ tz La ^ 44!, U 5000 5/30 until he was informed of the conclusions of H.M.G. as to (1) the question whether we could claim m.f.n. rights in the event of the French or Dutch securing an extension; and (2) as to the feasibility of the Arab coast route. The F.O. have replied by despatch of 21st September regarding the m.f.n. question. This depends partly on whether the word 'subjects” in the m.f.n. article of our Treaty with Persia can be interpreted as including 'companies”. They also consider that it would be difficult to claim m.f.n. rights if the Persians should give a complete monopoly of their air services to the French or the Dutch (an improoable contingency). The F.O.therefore conclude that it is impossible to state how strong a claim H.M.G.might have until the question arises in practice. As regards Mr.Dodd’s question regarding the Arab route, it will now be possible to inform that preparations are being put in train. When the Persians become aware of this, it may have an effect in making their attitude more accommodating. We still have the inducement, for what it may be worth, of the re-opening of the Du^dap railway to give to the Persians on condition of their extending the Imperial Airways If it would increase the valuejlinute Paper.

The Marquess of Reading to Mr. Dodd [Tehran). Foreign Office, September 21 , 1931. (No. 543. Very Confidential.) ^ ir ’ T ttatttp a a * , L vjjice, September 21, 1931. I HAVE received your despatch No. 423 of the 10 th August in which you request to be iinnished ith a considered opinion on the question whether in the event ot the Persian Government renewing the nermissiofi at nrPQPnt requ^u ^ ^ opinion on the question whether, in the event of the Persian Government renewing the permission at present enioyed by the Dutch and French air lines to fly along the Persian shore of the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government would be able to claim a similar extension of permission on behalf of Imperial Airways on the grounds of their rights to most- favoured-nation treatment in Persia. 2. As you are aware, most-favoured-nation treatment in Persia is accorded to British subjects and their trade by article 9, paragraph 2 , of the Amdo-Persian Treaty of 1857, which runs as follows :— The high contracting parties engage that the treatment of their respective subjects, and their trade, shall also, in every respect be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of’the most favoured nation.” 3. In order to establish the right to claim for Imperial Airways, under this treaty article, permission to use a route in Persia for a commercial air service, on the ground that similar permission had been given to French and Dutch air transport companies, it will be necessary in the first place for His Majesty’s Government to show that Imperial Airways are covered by the word “ subjects.” The first question, therefore, is whether, in this treaty, the word “subjects” applies to “companies,” that is, whether it includes corporations as well as individuals. His Majesty’s Government do not usually interpret the word “subjects ” as including corporations, as is shown by the ordinary commercial treaties between Great Britain and other countries, which contain certain articles giving rights to subjects and citizens, and certain other articles setting forth the treatment to be accorded to companies. On the other hand, there are certain old treaties in connexion with which His Majesty’s Government have, in the past, contended for, and have in practice secured, an interpretation of “subjects ” as including companies. 4. But even if this difficulty can be overcome, it is difficult to express a categorical opinion on the possibility of establishing conclusively a legal case under the most-favoured-nation provisions of the treaty of 1857. The Persian Government might w T ell endeavour to complicate the legal point at issue. They might, for example, assert that they had decided to reorganise completely their air communications, and had reached the conclusion that it would be in Persia’s best interests to grant a concession to a particular foreign company, or companies, giving them under suitable conditions the complete monopoly of operating air services across Persian territory. It is questionable whether, in that event, it would be possible for His Majesty’s Government to establish a claim that, because Persia had given a concession to companies of French and Dutch nationality, she was also bound under her most-favoured-nation obligations to grant the same or a similar concession to a British company. The Persian Government might claim that most-favoured-nation rights could not be considered as applying to the grant of concessions, since a concession obviously cannot be extended to an unlimited number of concessionnaires. 5. For these reasons, it is not possible to state in advance, before the question has arisen in practice, and before it is known in precisely what form the question i s likely to arise, how strong a claim His Majesty’s Government could advance for most-favoured-nation treatment in this respect. The strength of such a claim must depend largely upon the form in which the question arises, and this in its [254 x— 1 ]2 turn depends upon the Persian Government. In practice the Persian Govern ment mav find it difficult to adduce reasonable grounds tor a retusal to grant Imoerial Airways the same facilities as they grant to other foreign air lines, and th s mav be all that the Persian Minister lor Foreign Afiairs meant when he mentioned the question of most-favoured-nation treatment to the French Minister. At the same time it must be recognised that it the purely legal issue were taken to arbitration it is by no means certain that His Majesty s Government would wir&gt; their case - and while it may be found advisable to appeal in the last resort to most-favoured-nation rights, it would be unwise to rely on the supposition that such an argument will prove successful. u o r i , 6 yg regards the last sentence of paragraph 3 of your despatch, there can he no'auestion of giving an assurance to the French and Netherlands Govern ments that His Majesty’s Government will not, in any circumstances, claim most- f . r ed-nation treatment in Persia for Imperial Airways. Such an assurance would only render it more difficult to obtain for Imperial Airways an extension of the South Persian route, and would serve no useful purpose. I appreciate the fact that, if Imperial Airways operate the Arabian route, and the Frenc! and Dutch Air companies are also precluded from operating the South Persian rorte these companies will also probably have to be accorded facilities on the Arabian route, provided that they are prepared to use flying boats instead of land planes, and to comply with such reasonable conditions as may be considered necessary.

But Traver’s survey affords convenient introduction and in communicating result on behalf of Imperial Airways I could enquire what alternative Persian Government had to offer and press for urgent reply as time was getting short. To do more might be unwise. This step would be more effective if bare statement that route was impracticable owing to high mountains etc. could be backed by reasoned argument in support of this statement. Traver's report, some of the enclosures to ’which I could communicate, unfcrtunauely contains no general 'conclusions'.

I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretarv to the Government of India and to His Alajesty s Acting High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES DODD. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “ Ittild-dt 'of August 2, 1931 (Translation.) ~ The Junkers Contract. THE prospective renewal of the contract granted by the Government to the Junkers Company gives us occasion to set forth our views on this question. We hope that the authorities will receive them in the same impartial and unbiased spirit in which they are given : — Desiring to introduce all the latest improvements into the country, the Government took steps to create a system of aerial posts in Persia. This gave rise to a competition between French and German aviation companies, which was won in Bahman 1304 by the Germans, who offered the best terms. Those who had the progress of Persia at heart welcomed this even!, and the papers described the inauguration of an aerial post as a useful step in the advancement of the new Persia. The concession was granted for five years, and it will therefore come to an end in Bahman of this year (sometime in February 1932). It may be as well, at this stage, briefly to review the history of this concession, in order to ascertain whether the contracting company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and to determine whether the renewal of its contract is genuinely in the advantage of Persia. Before proceeding to answer these questions we must give the directors of the company their due and testify to their proficiency and technical and scientific qualifications. They have done much to gain the public confidence, and their aeroplanes have suffered hardly a casualty. We do not therefore wish to call in question the safety, comfort, speed or solidity of their machines. We are also glad to be able to say that notwith standing the hot climate of our country and its peculiar meteorological conditions, their aeroplanes have fully proved their worth so that the various types oi accident so frequent, even in Europe, have seldom occurred in this country. Having said this, we must, however, state that where its own advantage was not concerned the contracting company has seldom stopped to consider the vital interests of this country in matters to which we attach the utmost importance, ana this, though the Persian Government have always taken great care to safeguard the company's interests, and have even gone so far as to exempt the petrol an lubricating oil used by the company from customs dues. The company undertook by virtue of section (c) of article 8 of e concession— To establish a technical aviation school and import instructional aeroplanes for the training of Persian pilots and mechanics. Section {d) of the same article runs :— The admission by the company into its various institutions of two Persian students at a time, throughout the period of the cqntrac , instruction at the expense of the company in all branches of aviation. Section (/) of the same article :— . , The formation of a Persian aviation company in accordance wi Persian law.0 Section (h) of the same article :— The use by the company throughout the period of the concession of a number of large aeroplanes with three engines and the use, if necessary, of one such machine immediately after the sanction and granting of this concession. The Government had in mind to ensure that while others reaped the • avantages of the contract, Persia should also benefit through an arrangement by which she should eventually be able to count on a number of trained Persian nilots and air mechanics. They wished to bring about the establishment of an aviation school, the training of two Persian students at a time in the various branches of the company and the formation of an aviation company with at least half of the shares held by Persians. None of these obligations, though legally binding on the company, have been put into effect, and it is the company which is responsible for the fact that advantages which should have accrued five years ago to Persia still remain in abeyance. One wonders whether it is really expedient that the concession should be renewed with a company which regards with total indifference the interests of the Government which granted it. From the legal point of view the answer is in the negative, unless indeed the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, who enjoys a merited reputation as a competent official and an energetic supporter of Persian interests, is fully satisfied that the company wl ll turn over a new leaf and will henceforth fulfil scrupulously its obligations and safeguard Persian interests. Confident as we are that the present Government never adopts an obstructive attitude towards any measure conducive to the public welfare we cannot but attribute the indifference displayed towards these unfulfilled obligations to the company and not to the Government, and ^e therefore repeat that unless the interests m question are safeguarded, the concession should not be renewed to Junkers. We consider that it is in the interests of our country that at the present stage when the contract has still five months to run, this hint should be given to the Government, in order that when the time comes to consider the renewal more attention may be paid to the moral and material interests of the Persian people. 35947&lt;J3a 5000 10/30 U.s,$. Please see Mr.Hendel's letter of 16th September below. It was contemplated by the Cabinet on 30th July that if the negotiation with Persia (for continued permission to fly the S.Persian route in exchange for reopening of the Duzdap Railway) fails, the Air Ministry should consider preparations for the Arab route (see flag A). The present position is that the negotiation with Persia has not yet failed, but that we shall probably not Know for some time whether it is a failure or not. In these circumstances it seems desirable to proceed with preparations for the Arab route as a pis aller, i.e. to prepare plans to which if necessary ? effect can be given at short notice. ..'hat seems to be specially required is the preparation of plans on the technical side; this is a matter lor the Air Ministry in consultation with Imperial Airways. It is doubtful whether plans on the political side can ma*e much further progress beyond the point already reached - viz. the de facto_ establishment of a skeleton military route. Colonel Biscoe at any rate thinks that it is a mistake to approach the Sheikhs with tentative and contingent schemes ; and preferable to make up minds first as to what we require of them so that we can adopt a firm and definite attitude; if we asked for facilities which we may (contingently) require, and if they objected and we subsequently found that we did not require the facilities, they would think that our desistence/i /V'/V*4_V tt, /t^S / Las** Us* it it* f *' desistence was due to their objections and prestige would suffer. However, we can consioer what c&amp;n be done to prepare the minds of the Sheiichs for the advent of a civil route, when the technical side of the scheme is more advanced, and we iinow exactly what facilities would be required and where. The Air Ministry memorandum to the Cabinet stated that if the service is operated^as ia proposed, by flying boats, it would only be necessary to have one intermediate landing place on the Trucial Coast, viz: at Baz-al-Kharis, or alternatively at Um$t\-al-Qaiwan. As a step towards the materialisation of a definite scheme, we might a^c the Air Ministry if they have no objection, to get a report on the technical suitability of Abu Musa as an alternative to Ras-al-Khairafciwpraft P^P er&lt; - ri L. Bertram, Esq., C.B.E., AIR MINISTRY, GW} r dyr house, S.Y. i. S 6 SEP 1931 ^ ^ X* 7 '- twv4x ^ *v. 7 Dear Bertram, With ref. to Rendei’s letter of 16 Sept., E 4550/439/34, of which he sent you a copy, and our telephone conversation, 1 write to say that we agree that if the Air Ministry see no objection, it would be desirable to arrange for an expert examination of the possibilities of Abu Musa from the technical point of view, before the examination takes place, hov/ever, it would be desirable tuat the A.O.C. should get in touch with the Pol. Resident in order to maKe / * sure that there is no locaj. difficulty in carrying it out. We understand that at tne time of the Cabinet decision of 30 July last it was contemplated that if the negotiations with Persia for continuation of the imperial Airways service along the soutn Persian coast fai^f the Air Ministry would consider preparations for a service along ' the Arab coas/ The negotiations have not yet failed, but as we ehafi not know for some time whether they are a failure or a success, it seems desirable to 1 complete/complete / so far as possible,the preparation of definite plans 1 oi an Arab coast route, so that it Trill be possible to give effect to them at sho notice if we have to fall oacn on that/ T't route. The preparation of plans on thei technical side especially seems ^o ue desirable, so that we may know exactly at what places facilities for the civi.. air route would be required and the extent of the facilities at each place. It will then be possible to consider what should be done to prepare the minds of the Sheikhs, etc., concerned^and to obtain the facilities, though it is a question whether any definite approach should be made to the Sheikhs until th3 Persian negotiations break down and we thus become certain that we shall require the facilities. When we know this we can make firm demands on them to which they are more likely to be amenable than t o contingent demands or requests. This at least, as you probably know, is Biscoe’s view of the question of the tactics to be adopted with them. At any rate the first thing necessary seems to be to reach final conclusions as to what facilities will, be required and where, and in view of the difficulties experienced before at Has/£ ^ , ££3 FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.V/.1 16th September, 1931 (E 4550/439/34) Dear Walton, Dodd's latest despatch about the South Persian ^ir Route (No.464 of August 25th), a copy of which will shortly he sent you in print, mentions the question of the tactics to he pursued if there is no further move from the Persian side in response to our offer to reopen the Duzdap railway in return for an extension of the air route. As you know, we cannot press the Persians on the question of this suggested bargain, or our lever would lose even such doubtful - value as it at present possesses. It was just an off chance that the Persians might think the deal worth while. If they do not, I fear there is no more to be done in that ^articular direction. Meanwhile Dodd points out that it is difficult for him to suggest the best course of action until he is definitely informed inter alia of the conclusions reached by His Majesty's Government as to the feasibility of the route down the M.CV/e are a little uneasy at having heard no more about the question of the examination and preparation of the Arabian route, which as you know we have been urging so strongly for so long. Vie fully realise how greatly preferable it would be to secure a continuance of the permission to use the Persian route, but we -till feel very strongly that it may prove impossible to secure this, and that it is essential, from every point of view, that we should be ready with an alternative. It seems to us therefore most important that the matter should not be allowed to drift, and we wonder whether any steps have yet been taken with regard to the Government of India's suggestion that use should be . •, = ^ na+pad of the Xrueial Coast made of Abu Musa island, instead or i„eir (... paragraph = talagra. ot P«lP »«*).

As you are aware, most-favoured- nation treatment in Persia is accorded to British subjects and their trade oy Article 9. paragraph 2 of the Anglo-PerSian Treaty/r.-. m r V ^ - raa ty of 1857, ahioh runs as follows: •’The iiigh Contracting parties engage nhat the treatment of their respective 'su bjects, and their trade, shall also, in 'every respect, be placed on the footing of the 'treatment of the subjects and commerce of the 'mos t-favoured-nation. 7f 3. In order tu establish the right to claim for Imperial Mrvuays, under this Treaty Article, permission to use a route in Persia for a commercial air service, on the ground that similar permission had been given to drench and Dutch air transport companies, it lill be necessary in the first place for Bia Majesty* s Grovernment to show that Imperial Airways are covered &amp;y the word '’subjects’. The first question, therefore, is whether, in this Treaty, the word ’’subjects” applies to ’’Companies’*, that is, whether it includes corporations as well as individuals. His ^je^ty * s Government do not usually interpret the word ’’subjects’* as including corporations, £S/as is shown by the ordinary commercial treaties between Great Britain and other countries, which contain certain articles giving rights to subjects and citizens and certain other articles setting forth the treatment to be accorded to companies. On the other hand, there are certain old treaties in connexion with which His Majesty's Government have in the past contended for, and have in practice secured, an interpretation of 'subjects' as including companies. 4. But even if this difficulty can be overcome, it is difficult to express a categorical opinion on the possibility of establishing conclusively a legal case under the mo at- favoured-nation provisions of the treaty of 1657. The Persian Government might well endeavour to complicate the legal point at issue. They might, for example, assert that they had decided to re-organise completelycompletely their air communications, and had reached the conclusion that it would be in Persia's best interests to grant a concession to a particular foreign company, or companies, giving them under suitable conditions the complete monopoly of operating air services across Persian territory. It is questionable whether, in that event, it would be possible for His Majesty's (iovernnient to establish a claim that, because Persia had given a concession to companies of French and Dutch nationality. she was also bound under her most-favoured nation obligations to grant the same or a similar concession to a British company. The Persian Government might claim that most-favoured-nation rights could not be considered as applying to the grant of concessions, since a concession obviously cannot be extended to an unlimited number of concessionaires.5* For these reasons, it is not possible to state in advance, before the question has arisen in practice, and before it is ioiown in precisely what form the questimi is likely to arise, how strong a claim His Majesty's Government could advance for most-favoured-nation treatment in this _ respect. ?he strength of such a claim must depend largely upon the form in which the question arises, and this in its turn depends upon the Persian Government. In practice, the Persian Government may find it difficult to adduce reasonable grounds for a refusal to grant Imperial Airways the same facilities as they grant to other foreign air lines, and this may be all that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs meant when he mentioned the question of most favoured-nation treatment to the French Minister. At the same tine it must be recognised that if the purely legal issue were taken to arbitration, it is by no I f ‘ 4 1 meansmeaES certain that His Majesty's Government W ould win their case; and, while it may be fou^v advisable to appeal in the last yesort to most-favoured-nation rights, it uould he unwise to rely on the supposition that such an argument will prove successful. 6. As regards the last sentence of paragraph 3 of your despatch, there can he no question of giving an assurance to the French and Netherlands Governments that His Majesty's Government will not, in any circumstances, claim most-favoured-nation treatment in Persia for Imperial Airways. Such an assurance would only render it more difficult to obtain fo&gt;r Imperial Airways an ^tension of the South Persian route, and would serve no useful purpose. I appreciate the fact that, if imperial Airways operate the Arabian route, and the French and Dutch Air companies are also precluded from operating the South Persian route, these companies will also probably have to he accorded facilitieson the Arabian route, provided that they are^- prepared to use flying boats instead of land planes, and to comply with such reasonable conditions as may be considered necessarySECRET FK3/AW (75 gi'oupa) DBCYPHBR OF Tg LB G H A M s Prom Government cf India, Foreign and Politicsai Department, to (C0PI3S Secretary* of State for India c CIBCULA1SD) u ± e Dated 3iuila s 25th July, 193! a Faoei7©d 35th July, 1931, 12 e 30p c nu 1851 3 q First of Three Parts.

The proposal is related to difficulties between the British and Persian governments over securing an extension of Imperial Airways' concession to operate in Persia. The volume therefore also contains papers related to the progress of negotiations between the British Government and the Government of Persia. However, the majority of the volume relates to the examination of the Arabian Coast option; this includes potential route options, possible sites for facilities, estimates of expenditure, and progress reports on negotiations between the Trucial Shaikhs – primarily at Dubai and Ra's al-Khaymah – and Hugh Vincent Biscoe, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The volume also contains minutes of the meetings of the Official and Ministerial Sub-Committees of Imperial Defence for the Consideration of Middle Eastern Questions: 2 November 1931 (folios 226-35), 5 November 1931 (folios 217-25), 17 November 1931 (folios 175-82), 17 December 1931 (folios 89-102), and 15 February 1932 (folios 28-31 and folios 22-5). Related notes and memoranda can also be found within the volume.A number of extracts from reports (dated 24 March, 26 April, and 25 September 1932) from E C Denison and D S McGrath, Commanding HMS
                           Bideford, on trips to the Trucial Coast can be found on folios 3-9; this includes details relating to the construction of the Sharjah Aerodrome.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, officials of the Admiralty, officials the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Debai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Umm-al-Qawain</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001ed#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
