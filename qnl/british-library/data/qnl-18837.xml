It notes that the documents were penned prior to the Resident's communications conveying the resolution of the British Government respecting the sons of the Ex-Chief of Bahrein [Bahrain], so they shed no light on Ameer Fysul's [Amīr Fayṣul] reaction to it.It further notes that the documents reference a communication from the previous Resident — Samuel Hennell — sanctioning assistance for the exiled sons from the Wahabee ruler in the event they sought to retake Bahrein.The item has three enclosures:1. Translation of a letter from Ameer Fysul, Wahabee Chief to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 14 January 1855.The enclosure explains that the Wahabbe Chief mediated a settlement designed to heal the rupture between the Al Khaleefeh [Āl Khalīfah] and Al Abdullah respecting Bahrein, but that this was broken by the Al Khaleefeh who exiled the Al Abdullah to Demaun [Ad-Dammān]. It therefore explains that the Al Abdullah (the exiled branch of the Uttoobee family) have a genuine claim over Bahrein, that they do not intend to create disorder at sea, and that they should not be prevented from prosecuting this claim by the British.It further claims that the Wahabbe Chief also does not intend to sow maritime disorder, but only wishes for his rights and obligations respecting Bahrein to be undeniably recognised.2. Translation of a letter from Ameer Fysul, Wahabee Chief to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 14 January 1855.The enclosure outlines the Chief's friendship with the British Government, along with his status and responsibilities as a dependant of the Ottoman Empire. It also notes that he is deputising Shaikh Abdul Azeez ben Seleem to present his views to the Resident.3. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Ameer Fysul, Wahabee Chief, dated 21 February 1855.The enclosure is acknowledging the receipt of the Wahabee Chief's communications (Nos. 1 and 2). In response, it refers him to the declaration made by the British Government respecting Bahrein, and the exiled branch of the Uttoobee family. It further states that all his arguments have been addressed in various communications made with him over the previous seventeen years, and that the British will not tolerate any further interference from him in the affairs of Bahrein, nor any attempts to prosecute hostilities against the island.It is explained that the exiled sons of the former Chief of Bahrein do not have the means to re-establish themselves without assistance, and that therefore their removal from Demaun furnishes the only option for future peace in the Persian Gulf. It notes that due provision will be made for their maintenance by the Chief of Bahrein, Muḥammed bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000039#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
