No. 102(4/10/37). British Legation, TSHUH. 17tn Kovember, 1937. Sir, /ith reference to my deepaton No.28 of tne 5th April, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from the foreign Office regarding the attitude to be adopted by Hie Majesty’s Government in the event of the arrest of a British subject at the outer anchorage at Bushire. 2. Subject to any observations which you may wish to offer, particularly with regard to the proposed definition of the outer anchorage, X would propose to reply that 1 agree that the best dourse, in the particular circumstances existing at Bushire, is that suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office despatch, and that I also agree that no communication need be made to the Iranian Government until a concrete case arises. It is undesirable to enter upon a barren controversy with tne Iranian Government over this question, and I consider that this will be best achieved by adopting the course proposed in paragraphs 3 to 5 of the Foreign Office despatch. I would suggest that it should be understood that if a case arises involving Iranian juris diction over a British subject on a ship at the outer anchorage, His Majesty’s Legation should at once be informed by telegraph, so that the necessary communication can be made to the Iranian Government without delay. It does not seem necessary that a similar comnunication should be made simultaneously to the Governor of Bushire. 3. 3efore replying to tne Foreign Office on these lines, I should be glad to learn whether you wish to offer any further observations in the light of the despatch of which a copy is enclosed. O.r.Caroe Esquire, C.I.E., The Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.3 ./ 7 e Copy. S0.339 (3 5852/653/34) 70 HE ION 07?I(TS, S.'T.l I8tn October, 1937 3ir I have had under consideration your despatch ho.128 (4/5/37) of the 5th April regarding the arrest by the Persian authorities of a member of the orew of the German 3.3.Ueierfels after being involved in an affray with Persian coolies on board that vessel while it was lying at the outer anchorage at luahire, and in which you requested instructions regarding the attitude* which His Majesty's Government proposed to adopt in the event of a 3ritish subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding circumstances. 2. After carefully weighing the various considerations put forward in your despatch under reference, I am of the opinion that for practical reasons it is desirable that Persian Juris diction should be recognised over the outer anchorage of the Persian port of Bushire. Owing to the shallowness oi the harbour, this is a place where sea-going vessels perform the operations which they would normally perform inside a port, and in so far as foreign vessels g 0 there for the purpose of establishing contact with the shore, and to that end admit Persian officials on board, they must be assumed to accept some measure of Persian jurisdiction. At the same time, it seems desirable to find a way of meeting the practical needs of this situation which does not prejudice the position which nis majesty* s Government have taicen up with regard to tne limits of territorial waters and, in particular, does not imply ary recognition by His Majesty's Government of the Persian claim to a six-mile limit (or in exceptional circumstances twelve miles) or a contiguous sone3 # In thftse oirc^rostanceaf I conaiciar tftat tne dilfilculty could best be raet f if Hie Majesty’* (ioreminent were to take the line tnat, in view of the special circunaatancee obtaining at Buahire, they intend, ao far as they are concerned, to regard the outer anchorage aa being under I'ereian juried let ion in the same manner aa if the anchorage were part of the Pere ian port of Buahire, and that ships going there will accordingly be deemed to be in t he same position as if they were in Persian national waters. This method appears prefer able to one involving any attempt to negotiate a special agreement with the Persian Government in regard to the outer ancho^rage at Bush ire, more especially as tnat Government clearly could not be expected to aocept a proposal for auen an agreement, the conclusion of which would be completely inconsistent with the attitude which they have always main tained regarding the limits of Persian territorial waters. 4. If this policy is to serve its purpose, it ought to be conraunicated officially to the Persian Government. The communication would be a statement of tne view which His Majesty’s Government nad decided unilaterally to adopt witn regard to this matter, and would contoin a definition of woat they conceived to be tne geographical llmite of tne anchorage. I am advised that a simple definition wnicn would be adequate for this purpose would be *an area within one mile of tne chartered position of tne Whiter Ancnora^e light buoy *. 1 shall be glad if you will consider this suggestion, if necessary in consultation with tne acting Political Heoident in the Persian Gulf, and furnish me witn your opinion on it in due course. 5 . A furtner point requiring consideration is tnat of tne t ime /time at w&amp;icJa tue proposed contaunication w^iich is to be addressed to tne Persian &lt;i over ran ant snoold be made in order best to serve the purpose in vis's, dn general, I consider that little would be gained tiy making this communication before tne particular circumstances whion would render it necessary nave arisen, and it might be best to wait until a concrete case of tne kind contemplated in tne last sentence of paragraph 2 of your despatch under reference hae occurred, nevertheless, I an prepared to leave it entirely to your discretion to decide en the time and manner of making such a coamunication, and you are authorised to take such action at any time when, in the light of local considerations, it may appear desirable.
