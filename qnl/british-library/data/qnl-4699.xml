Robinson states that the HC schooner
                           Constancehas been dispatched to Lingah with Merza Futtah Alley on board. Robinson encloses a copy of a report (also dated 24 August) received from Lieutenant Robert Anstice Stradling, Commander of the
                           Constance, in which it is stated that the Sheik of Lingah has requested that he be given four months to pay the sum of 2500 Shah keroons. Robinson states that he has advised Merza Futtah Alley to accede to this request, as the Sheik has seized all of the slaves that have been landed at his port. Robinson concludes by stating that the separate payment of the sum of 535 keroons has been adjusted between the Sheik and the Agent at Lingah. In his report, Stradling attaches a written engagement from the Sheik and a letter addressed to Robinson, both of which are not included here.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
