I do not tMnk that we can successfully assert principle that part payment of past debts to commer cial firms in consideration of their supplying further goods on credit, constitute preferential treatment, Saudi Government who need arms urgently for possible war would be delighted if His 'majesty's Governnent consented to similar deals with them. If above principle were asserted it would apply to various other transactions e.g. with Sharciieh and possibly Geilatley Hankey and Company, Limited, who have just completed transaction mentioned in my telegram Ho. although in the latter case arrangements turned rather on a current account financed on baud! side bj Grafts on customs and certain cash payments. As regards the political aspect I consider more and more that the disadvantage of applying extreme pressure at the present time far outweighs any pecuniary advantage obtainable by such pressure, n however I aim to exert it I consider the only course is to insist, when the King visits Jedda, on last proposal made on behalf of His Majesty's Government in December without definitely'invoking other transactions r... *»transactions, althougli I can point to sonic of tliom as showing that money is not so short as has he on suggested. If war breaks out immediately after the pilgrimage the whole natter should in my opinion he postponed; If it o.oes not break out then it is unlikely to break out at all and the case for renewing pressure on the lines indicated in preceding paragraph will be stronger /r &amp; INDEXty In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - . and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

British Legation, Jedda. 13th February 1934. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt 13* i/nCS/ of ’ your despatch No. 4 (177/3/34) of January 25 last ' /3^r and to thank you for the information contained therein regarding the proceedings of Monsieur Wilniewczyc and the inquiries addressed to the Oriental Secretary by the First Secretary of the Polish Legation in Cairo. The information supplied by Monsieur Benis agrees generally with that given in my despatch to the Foreign Office No. 23 of January 29, a copy of which I sent to the Residency on the same date, except that according to Mr. Philby the Saudi Government wished to order an even larger quantity than in 1930. 2. The position regarding the importation of arms and ammunition by the Saudi Government is determined by letters (5) and (6) attached to the Treaty of Jedda, as regards supplies by British manufacturers. So far as I am aware, His Majesty’s Government have consistently held since that time that no exception could be taken to the importation of war material by Ibn Saud from any source. I would, however, draw your attention to what was said in Sir P. Cunliffe Lister’s Secret despatch of November 20 to the Resident at Aden (Eastern (Arabia) print Section 1 of/ The Acting High Commissioner, The Residency, Cairo. Wof November 20 last) regarding the possible effect of an outbreak of war between the Imam Yahya and Ibn Saud. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State, to whom you have doubtless sent a copy of your despatch under reference. I have, etc., (Sd) ANDREW RYAN.*-7 (E 986A2/S5) ao.^2^.

V \ His Majesty’s Coirrmiesioner in ^gynt, T?o. 3 of January 13, in which he wrs good enough to pass on to me certain information from the Polish Legrtion in Cairo regarding the visit of a certain Minsieur ^ilniewczyc to Jedda. A copy of this despatch has been sent to you direct and you may perhaps be interested to receive such further particulars as I can give. 2. Monsieur ilriewczyc in fact arrived in Jedda on or about January 8 and, although he did not call on me, I met him the next evening at a dinner given by Mr. Philby, whose guest he was, in honour of the Amir Feysal. He left a week or ten days later, having in the meantime conferred with the Minister of Finance. 3. You are aware of the circumstances connected with the arms and ammunition imported by Ibn Sa’ud from Poland in the ss.'Cracow' in 1930. Half the bill was paid at the time but half remained outstanding. The figures given then and now do not quite tally but Mr. Fhilby confirms Sir M. Lampson's information that the balance due is £30,000, meaning, I think, £30,000 gold. I gather that the suppliers were a consortium of Polish arms factories, in which the Polish Oovemment are interested. They h^ve tried more than once to get paid, always without success 4. The Right Honourable, Sir John aimon, 0.0. E. X. , K.C.V. 0. , .tc. , etc. , etc. i ■4. According to Mr. PhiTby, the fca'udi Governwent are now deeirous of obtaining a very large quantity of anae and aTsinunl tton frow the same group. He told we a few daya ago in one of onr usual confidential conversations that II. Wilniewczyc had taken away with him for mibrlesion to hie principals a proposal that, in roneider^tlon of receiving £700C or £8000 as a peyrrent on accoxmt of the old debt, the Foies should supply further sorb, &amp;c. to the value of £100,000, The ^ggreg te of this new debt «nd the balance of the old would then be paid off in instalraento by means of irrevocable drafte on customs. T gather from earlier convers tiona with Mr. ” hilby that there may also be a question of reorganising the Oovcrnrent workshon rt Mecca but he has not recently mentioned this. I also gather that Sharqleh Limited would come into the business in some way, presumably as agents. 5* I cannot be certain whether the above second or third hand -ccount of what la proposed is accurate. Personally I think that the Poles would be fools to embark on so risky a tranauction but much would deoand on the nature of the drafts on customs. If they took the share of orders to pay periodical sums out of current revenue, the business, though still risky, might be worth considering. If, however, they took the more usual form of drafts to be accepted in payment or part payment of duty on goods imported by the holders, it would take the Polee a very long time to get their money bnck. Should the deal go through the question will arise whether the arr &lt; ng^ments do not involve preferential treatment of the kind referred to in the recent correspondence relative to His Pa^lesty’s dovemment s claims against the fa'ydi Government.v 6, I aw sending coning of thie de:patch to Cairo and the Department of Overseas Trade.

Sir, I nave the honour to inform you that the First Secretary of the Polish Legation called at the Residency yesterday with reference to the arrears of payment, amounting to thirty thousand pounds, due hy Ihn Saud to a Polish group in respect of arms and ammunition supplied in 1930. Monsieur Benis explained that the Saudi Govern- ment, having agreed to pay interest on the sum outstanding, appeared to intend to rest on this virtuous decision until the end of time. 2. He wished the Residency to know that a certain Monsieur Wilniewczyc, Professor at the Warsaw polytechnic, had recently left for Jeddah, with a view to negotiating with the Saudi Government an early settlement of the Polish claim. He mentioned this to obviate any risk that distorted accounts of Monsieur Wilniewczyc*s mission or activities in Jeddah might reach you. Similarly, in order to obviate any misrepresentations from the Arab side, he had advised Monsieur Wilniewczyc to leave his card on you. No question of his invoking your assistance, however, arose. 3.

Dear Count Los, On June 25 you kindly told me that a representstire of Ibn Ssud had come to mra&amp;w and asked the Polish Coremment to recognise Ibn Sand as king of the Hejaz, and to eonelude a commercial treaty with him; and also that the Polish OoTeraraent, before girlng an answer to this envoy, wished to know whether His Majesty*s Government had any objection to their complying with Ibn Saud's requests. In reply, I am directed to inform you that His Majesty's Government much appreciate the courtesy of the Polish Government In making this enquiry; that the Hejas and Hejd is an entirely independent kingdom, with which His Majesty's Government themselves are in treaty relations, and that they oertainly have no objection to the Polish Government complying with the requests put forward by Ibn Ssud's representative. vSd.)
