Civil employment for Mechanical Transport driver reservists of the Indian Army. There are at present ahont 2500 Mechanical Transport driver reservists in the Indian Army, residing in civil districts in India, l^any of them are without civil employ ment, and the military authorities are anxious that every thing that is possible should 'be done to assist these re servists to obtain civil motor transport employment and thus maintain their efficiency. A Mechanical Transport reservist who is engaged in civil motor transport employment is absolved from annual military training provided he can produce a certificate from his employer every six months. 2. 'Hie Govemmf^nt of India are of the opinion that such valuable assistance in this matter can be given t )y local governments and administrations not only by employing Mecha nical transport reservists as drivers or mechanics in posts under their own control, but by encouraging employers and civil government officials to do the same. The rates of nay suggested are a minimum of Ps 20/- per mensem and a normal maximum of 25/- per mensem, subject to any private arrangement between employer and employee. 3. I am therefore to request that if His Excellency the you Governor in Council has no objection, instructions to this have effect may be issued. Spare copies of an appropriate poster are sent here with for distribution. Application for the services of Me chanical Transport reservists should be made to the Officer- in-Charge, P.oyal Indian Army Service Corns Records, Dagshai. 4.

Subject:- Classification of electric water heaters, electric heaters etc* &lt;&gt;•••• I am directed to address the Governmentof India on the question of classification of Electric water-heaters, etc. installed in residential buildings owned by Government and in this connection to forward herewith a copy of a note dated 17th November 1937, on the question,by Superintending Engineer, Electric Circle. The Communication and Works Department of this Govern ment who agree with the views expressed by the Superintending Engineer, have suggested that only 'portable' heaters or water heaters which obtain their electrical energy by means of a moveable plug in a socket in the wiring system should be classi fied as furniture and that other electric heaters or water heaters which are fixed to walls, floors or celling of Govern ment buildings should be classified as fixtures and accordingly installed at public expense. It appears from the Auditor General's letter No.T-458- Admn.-11/96-36 dated 29th June 1936 (copy enclosed) addressed to the Accountant General, Madras, a copy of wnich was sent to this Department by the Accountant-General, Bengal, that, the Government of India have decided that an electric vat^r-heater should,like a frigidaire, be classified as furniture. It is not clear as to whether the aforesaid decision specifically relates to portable electric water heaters only. In the cir- cumstances I am to request that, if there is no objection, this Department may be furnished with the views of the Government of India on, the above subject, and with copies of any r. levant papers bearing on the point. ASR/27.5 I 1 i'2 i- N o t e&gt; I agree entirely with the first part of C,E/s note i-e, that Electric water heaters which form a part of a central vater installation for heating a house and providing hot water on tap or at several points in a house shoujd be classified as fixtures and provided by Oovernment^ 2, I think however that in addition any electric water heater or electric heater which is placed in a fixed position and fixed to the walls, floor or ceiling of any G-overnment building should similarly be classified as a fixture and that the classification of furniture should apply only to portable apparatus the electric supply to which is given through a removable electric plug in a wall socket. 3, Also, I think provision must be made for classification in such cases where portable heaters are provided in non-residential buildings as well as in residences for apparatus other than those covered by Grovemment letter No .1615-62-B., dated 4'-4-36» In such cases I consider apparatus should be supplied by or through the loCal Electrical Executive Engineer if paid for from any G -ovem- ment fund, on a contribution basis and should be taken on the books of that division for maintenance. I do not think :hat Government will be sufficiently protected by the mere proviso that the apparatus should be supplied by the occupants aft^r consulting the local Electrical Executive Engineer. 4, I suggest therefore that the following be the w noto' to bo issued* (i) Electric heaters ajnd water heaters which are fixed to the walls, floors or ceilings of Government buildings snail be classified as fixtures and provided by Government tha cost being added to th^ capital cost of the electric installation for the purpose of calculating house rent under F.R, 45- a or electric rent under F.R. 45 B as the case may be* (ii) Portable heaters or water heaters which obtain their electrical energy by means of a moveable plug in a socket in the wiring system may be classed as furniture* But ' —JK J 'V Copy of letter No.T-458-Admn.11/^6-36 dated the 2^th June 1936 from the Auaitor General in India, Simla to the Accountant-G-eneral, Madras ' * Subject; - Classification of Electric vVater-heater.

I am directed to stat'e that from certain recent cases it appears that the need for care in dealing with questions relating to the erection of religious structures on G-overnmont property is not fully appreciated. The Government of India accordingly consider it desirable to indicate'the principles which should guide officers dealing with such questions, 2. As all structures used for religious purposes acquire a peculiar sanctity, the erection of any such structure in a building or on land belonging to Government is for two reasons undesirable. In the first place, whatever the strict legal position may be, the difficulty of removing a religious structure is frequently so great that the existence of anv such structure is sufficient to impair %j % the right of Government to use its property as it pleases. Secondly, there is a tendency to convert all questions renting to the religious observances of any one section of Government servants into communal questions. -It^may, .for example, be alleged that facilities allowed to oiv^ community have been denied to another, or that the grant or refusal of facilities for worship is dependent on the prejudices of a particular officer. 3. The cases with which officers are likely to be called upon to deal fall in the following categories (a) requests for permission to erect new structures to be used for religious purposes or to modify or extend exi;ting structures r-o used; (b) proposals for the removal or modification, for official purposes, of existing structures used for religious purposes,'i (c) the unauthorized erection of new structures for religious purposes, or the unauthorized modification or extension of -existing structures. I am to emphasize the fact that in a.ii cases the head of the office, or when two or more offices are located in one building, the officer . . ii' ** who deals with matters relating to the building as a whole, is responsible for the protection of Government property. T 'Vhen a Government building is in the administrative charge of the Public Viorks Department encroachments are or should be reported periodically to the Department occupying the bui-lding; but if proper vigilance is exercised the head of the office should receive immediate information of encroachments of all kinds. 4. Turning to the cases falling in category (a) in the preceding paragraph, I am to say that it would seldom be necessary to authorize the erection of new structures for religious purposes, or the modification or extension of existing structures. When a particular building has been occupied by Government offices for many years, there is a fair presumption that the facilities for worship which have sufficed in the past are sufficient in the present. The Government of India desire that cases in this category should be dealt witti by the Head of the Department concerned, in consultation with the Public Works Department when that Department is responsible for the maintenance of the building. 5. With regard to cases falling in category (b), it is hardly necessary to point out that any interference with the use of an existing structure may give rise to difficulty. Should it bj a^sired to demolish or modify an existing structure, the Head of the Office should satisfy himself of the acquiescence of the members of the community who actually use the structure, and if there is anj doubt as to the propriety of the proposals, or any opposition on religious grounds, should invariably consult the District Magistrate and tn-j Head of the Department before proceeding. 6. The cases falling in category (c) are those which a^e likely to present most difficulty. A careful watch should be kept by the^Keadof the Office to see that no unauthorized structures are erected, and that no unauthorized modifications in, or extensions to, existing structures are made. If such a watch is kept, and if prompt steps are taken to stop any unauthorized construction, it should generally be possible to prevent the work from proceeding beyond the initial stages. If, however, any structure has been completed, or if the members of the community concerned do not agree to stop construction, and it therefore becomes necessary to demolish the structure, the District Magistrate should invariably be consulted, and should be asked to take prompt steps for its removal.

The 'government of India accordingly conside; it desiraDie to indicate the principles which should s^uide officers dealing with such questions, 2, As all structures used for religious purposes a,cquire a peculiar sa.ncticy, the erection of any such structure in a building or on land belonging to Government is for two reasons undesirable. In the first .place, whatever the strict legal position may be, the difficulty oi removing a religious structure is frequently so ^reat that the existence ci any such structure is sufficient to impair the right -of Government to use its property as it pleases. Secondly, there is a tendency to convert all questions relating to biie reli^icus obseivances Oa any one section of government servants into communal questions. It may, for example, be allegea that facilities allowed to on^ community have been denied to another, or that the grant or refusal of facilities for worship is dependent on the prejudices .of a particular officer, 3. The cases with which officers are likely to be called upon to deal fall in the following categories (a) requests for permission to erect new structures to be used for religious purposes or to'modify or extend exiiting structures so used; (b) proposals for the removal or modification, for official purposes, of existing structures used for religious purposes;(c) ths unauthorized erection of nev\/ structures for religious purposes, or the unauthorized modification o r extension of existing structures. I am to emphasize the fact that in all cases the head of the office, or when two or more offices are located in one 'building, the offio r ..... % who deals with matters relating to the building as a whole, is responsible for the protection of Government property. T 'Yhen a G-overnment building is in the administrative charge of the Public Works Bepclrtment encroachments are or should be reported periodically to the Department occupying the building; but if proper vigilance is exercised the head of the office should receive immediate information of encroachments of all kinds. 4. Turning to the cases falling in ca-tegory (a) in bhe preceding paragraph, I am to say that it would seldom be necessary to authorize the erection of new structures for religious purposes, or the modification or extension of existing structures. When a particular building has been occupied by G-overnment offices for many years, there is a fair presumption that the facilities tor worship which have sufficed'in the past are sufficient in the present. The Government of India desire that cases in this category should be dealt with by the Head of the Department concerned, in consultation with the rublic Works Department when that Department is responsible foi oho maintenance of the building. 5. With regard to cases falling in category (b), it is hardly necessary to point out that any interference with the use ol ah existing structure may give rise to difficulty. Should it be dosired to demolish or modify an existing structure, the Head of the Office should satisfy himself of the acquiescence of the members of the community who actually use the structure, and if there is a.ny doubt as to the propriety of the proposals, or any opposition on religious grounds, should invariably consult the District Magistrate snd the Head of the Department before proceeding. 6. The cases falling in category (c) are those which a-e likeiy to present most difficulty. A careful watch should be kept by the^Headof the Office to see that no unauthorized structures are erected, and that no unauthorized modifications in, or extensions to, existing structures are made. If such a watch is kept, and it should generally he possible to prevent the work from proceeding beyond the initial stages. If, however, any structure has been completed, or if the members of the community concerned do not agree to stop construction, and it therefore becomes necessary to demolish the structure, the District Magistrate should invariably be consulted, and should be asked to take prompt steps for its removal. prompt steps are taken to stop any unauthorized construction, it True copy. for Superintendent, Department of Labour.K«. -67/28-II-S. 40.

Dear Mr. Hallows, V ' J J'- In reply to your letter of the 25th June, I think the best thing I can do is to enclose a copy of a letter which I sent out in February to those parents who had made enquiries about educational facilities for their children who were remaining in India owing to the war. You will see that the response at that tine was much too small to justify us proceeding with the provision of a special school or schools for such children,quite apart from the difficulty of obtaining the necessary staffs and providing and equipping suitable buildings within a reasonable period. As most parents prefer arrange ments as close to their homes as possible we have done our best to meet this need on the lines set out in my letter. If there is any further information I can give you please do not hesitate to let me kno w. v^\ I Yours sincerely. H. I. Hallows, Esq., The hesiaency, Bahrein - Persian Gulf.D* O.No. P.27 -6/39-E. Office of the . v ./ Educational Coniniissioner vr itli the Government of Inctia, New uelni, the 15th February, 1940, Dear oir/'adarn, r ith reference to your application dated •* .***&gt; • ^ • * I expect you have been waiting f.or some tirae past.for further information -1th regard to the proposed scheme of providing educational facilities for Doy^, diid cii Is :io vT in India who but for the i ^ar wDuld nave been attending schools in England. Unfortunately it iic^b been necessary to ^wait until sufficient replies were received to enaole us t/O determine whether it ^'ould be piacticaole to start a special school as originally centemolauGu., citner at Ootacamund or some other suitable centre, or whether some alternative system on a local basis x)uld be more likely to meet the wishes of the majority of the parents concerned. 2. Although all the replies to my original enquiry licoVc not yet coiiie in, it is apparent from those already received that the number of parents -ho favour a central ociiool is far . goo small to justify us proceeding with an undertaking of this kind. As the majority have indicated that they would prefer arrangements of a more local cnaracter, I have discussed with the Directors of Public ±nstraction of Bengal, Bombay and -adras the possibility of j^p-Aixig arrangement:, on theso lines so far as boys and girls in uabturn, ''cistern and southern India are concerned, and tney have expressed their wliiingne.si? to afford any assis tance In their power, either by offering vacancies in schools ol good standing in their areas or possibly by organising instruction on tutorial lines. I have been personally exploring various possiMlitj®- so frx as children r.t present resident in northern Indi - ..reconcerned. Apart from the wishes expressed by nuiy parents, tiie iae divergence in the ages and previous education of the boys and girls in question and the impossibility una : r exist ing circumstances of recruiting either in India or from home the necessary staff of qualified teachers, as well as the factor of time, make the starting of a special school in northern India even more impracticable than such an under taking v/ould have oeen for India as a hole. I can therefore only suggest certain alternatives and leave it to parents to decide ■rhich, if any, of them //ould suit their particular Q p g 0 'por boys up to ten or eleven and for girls up to the School Certificate stage I ^/ould suggest that parents light get into touch with Miss D.Poole, 3 Queen Victoria ^oad, Ne :• Delhi. Miss Poole for some years past has been runnin ; m a school in Delhi and Simla for boys and girls up to eleven or twelve; mostly the children of Secretariat Officers, and she has recently strengthened her staff with a view to taking girls up to the School Certificate stage except in science . She would be prepared, 'if sufficient applications '-ere forth coming, to start a boarding school in Siml^ for between '50 and 40 pupils. She would also be prepared to open this school a month before the ordinary Simla season ana c^.rrv it on a month after the normal close ior those children hose parents do not move between Simla and Delhi. The fees to be charged for boarders cannot be finally decided until the number likely to avail themselves of the boarding house is known, but I think you -.lay take it that tne total cost of boaraing and tuition will not exceed that mentioned in my original letter. 4. I also understand from Miss M,Grove, who conducts the Garden School-3- at GuLiiarg - Kasimir - from May to ieptember that she would be prepared to take a few more children under 11 this year also and next suuiiierZif the war still continues. Hiss Grove's present address is Y. G.U, isoka ^oad. New Delhi. 5. There is also a school for girls in Simla named Auckland House School (Principal-Miss Budden who recently succeeded Ivliss Berry). It is I believe a school of good standing. 6. I woula suggest.that those parents who feel that any of the schools suggested would meet their cnildren's needs should get iiito touch at once with the Principal of the school they prefer. I may ao.a that so far as the starting of a boaraing house at Simla in connection with Miss Poole's School is concerned, a decision must be taken within the next fortnight and this will depend on the number of parents who have indicated to Kiss Poole 'by then that they desire such provision to be made. To justify the initial expense txhat will be involved parents must be prepared to guarantee that their children will remain at the school until the end of the Simla season or pay the fees for Lhat period in the event of their children being withdrawn previously. 7. So far as boys over ten or eleven. are concerned, there is, I am afraid, no school in northern India which caters exclusively or mainly for European boys with the possible exception of the Lawrence Military Schools, which are intended ma inly for tne cnildren of the N.C.O's and other ranks. There are, I understand, vacancies available at the Bishop Gottoni School, Simla, (Headmaster - 3ev. G. Sinker)- a school, mainly for Anglo-Inaian boys, and at the Aitchison Gollege, Lahore, (Principal - Mr, G.H.Barry) - one of the chiefs' colleges, which now admrits boys from other than the princely classes. The boys in the latter school are of course almost entirely Indians. Hie Por-n . t. • • 4Jocn School (Headmaster - Mr. A .S»Poot) at Jelira Jun - ♦ a school for Indian hoys run on English Public School lines - is full up' so far as hoarding accomraoiation is concerned hut the Heaomaster is prepared to admit a few more hoys as day hoys and arrangements might he made to , provide extra hoarding accomiuOdation if the number of applicants should justify it. All the three schools iiicnticned haVe a nuinhe^ of Englishmen on their staffs ana prepare hoys for the Camhridge School ana Higher School Certificate Examination. The hoarding accommodation and provision for games are in each case good. 8. The following schools have- also heen recommended to me as of good standing:- (i) Sherwood College, Naini Tal, United Provinces (Protestant). (ii) St. Joseph's College, Naini Tal United Provinces (Roman Catholic).. (iii) Woodstock College, Llussoorie, United Provinces (a co-educational school run hy American Missionaries). 9. Those parjntsinterested ire advised to apply at once aircCt to txie Hiaa of tne school concerned. If any parents feel tiv.t none of the suggestions contained in this letter will meet the needs of their children and will write to n\c stuting tneir precise requirements, I will see what can he aone hy advertisement or otnerv-ise to ohtiin tutors m the particular subjects required. Such arrange- he meiits will^iiecessarily expensive and will not provide the facilities for g^aies, use.of lahor .tories, etc., which would he available at an established school. 10. I an most nxious to iffora aay assistance in my power but I 'in sure you will realise that under existing circum stances it may not be possible to pro viae in Indii. education of . kind equiv lent to th it which some, vg ~ny rate, of the boys and girls concerned would h w. received if they had been able to return to their schools in England.

OnPICE MSMORANDUM In riew of the risk of the importation of yellow ferer to India by passengerB coming by air from those parts of Africa where the disease exists, the Government of India have prescribed certain conditions which must be observed by such passengers before they are allowed to enter this country* 2» A condition governing the entry into India by air of a passenger coming from an area infected with yellow fever is that a period of nine days must elapse between the dates of his departure from that area and his arrival at Karachi. If he arrives in Karachi before the nine days have elapsed he will be subjected to isolation for the balance of that period and the commander of the aeroplane is liable to severe penalties. Unrestricted admission to India from a yellow fever infected area is however allowed to a person who can produce evidence of satisfactoi-y inoculation against the disease. By this is mefi^t that he must have been inoculated not less than 14 days before he enters the yellow fever area or, in the alternative not less than 23 days before he arrives in Karachi from the infected area. 4 * The fact that an increasing number of persons from India is visiting Africa by air has made it desirable to provide facilities for inoculation against yellow fever before such persons leave India, in order to avoid delay on their return Journey. This has now been arranged and the inoculation of persons proceeding under Government auspices on Journeys that will take them to yellow fevir'i ) i o mtim area and likely to return to India by air can be done in New Delhi. 5 # The inoculation is of a simple nature and inTolves no risk to the individual. Only one dose is required and any temporary physical discomfort resulting from it is practically negligible. It takes fourteen days after inoculation for immunity against yellow ferer to be deyeloped and the protection conferred lasts for two years. It ia desirable that the inoculation should be performed not less than 14 days before arrival in a yellow fever area, if possible. 60 It is requested that the names of persons who are likely to visit or pass through a yellow fever area within the next three months and to return to India by air may be communicated to the Director-General Indian Fedioal Service, immediately so that arrangements may be made for their inoculation. The following are the areas which have teen declared by the Government of India to be infected with yellow fever. !• Angola, 3. ptian Sudan South of Khartoum# 3. Belgian Congo. 4 # Cameroons.

(1 am to add that the promulgation or these rules does not affect the arrangements made with the Provincial Government for the medical attendance of Central Government servants by Provincial Medical Officers on payment of fees). {2) under the existing reciprocal arrangements with the Provincial Governments, Central Government servants stationed in or passing through most of the Provinces receive medical attendance and treatment on the scale provided by the Provincial Gover ments to their own employees which is different in different Provinces, in order to accord uniform treatment to their employees throughout British j.ndia the Government of India have decided that with effect from the 1st January? 1944, Central Government employees stationed in or passing through the territories administered by the Provincial Government should receive medical attendance from medical officers employed under the Provincial Government on payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the Government of Madras/etc. in agreement with # the Government of India. In order .as far as possible to secure unfomity in the levy of fees on the employees of the Government of India in the different Provinces, I am to forward a schedule of fees prescribed by the Government'of Bombay and to request that if there is no objection, a similar scale of fees may be fixed by the Government of Madras/etc. Subject to any obser vations that the Provincial Government may make the Government of India consider that the employees concerned should pay the *?ees direct to the medical officers and then claim refund from their employers to the extent permissible under the secretary of state's services Cwiedical Attendance) Kules, 1938, or the Central Services ^Medical Attendance) Rules. 1944, as the case may be. (3; as regards hospital treatment, it is presumed that the Provincial Government have no objection to the servants of the Government of India being admitted into Provincial or state aided hospitals in Madras/etc. in common with other members of the general public and being charged by the hospital authorities according to the ordinary scales prescribed by them. The Govern ment of India suggest that the hospital authorities should submit their bills, signed in token of acceptance by the patient, to the Head of the Department to which the officer belongs for settlement. The share payable by the patient will then be recovered ffom the patient's salary. This system is in force in the Provinces, of Bombay, bengal, etc. and I am to request that it* there is no objection it may be introduced in the Province of Madras/etc. and the necessary instructions issued to the hospital authorities. P .t .u.4. ns regards the grant of medical certificates to Central Govt, employees for leave and other purposes I am to suggest that the follow ing procedure which has been prescribed for the medical examination of Central Government employees stationed or passing through Bombay/etc. should be followed.

There are, however, no orders as regards re-inoculation, -he Public Health Comnissioner with the Government of India, who La3 been consulted, considers that in order to ensure resonatle aegree of immunity a person should be re-inoculated every IS montns. In the Array. Commanding Officers are enjoined to make every endeavour to persuade personnel under their command .o accept _ inoculat i on' If periodical inoculation is made corapul&amp;or^ , an officer who refuses wUl be liable to disciplinary action. It seem £ dnnbtful wretl ^r it will be expedient to take disciplinary ac- - on in auch caaea^ It is oonsiderS that many officers do not get them 'selves inoculated due to their ignorance of the necessity o , or f^: to appreciate the tg?

I 2. I am to explain that the Secretary of State's Direction under section * 2f)0 (2) of the Government of India Act, I'JSD, declares that lections 2i7, 248 and 24^ of the said Act shall also apply in relation to any parson who for the time beinsj holds any Civil post under the Crown in India and is, or w£s when he was tirsfc appointed to. such a post, a Military Commissioned Officer of the categories specitied in that Direction. The rules made, or to be made, under section 247 (1) have however not been applied by that Direction to these officers. The Medical Attendance Hules have neen made under sections 24-7 (I), 250 (1) and 269 of the Act. The position therefore is that while those llules do not apply to Military Officers covered by the Direction, the Secretary of State is under an obligation to g make such rules in recpeet of those offu-ers. The Government of Iradii consider that the requirements of the case will be nret by additions to the preamble to, and the application clause of the existing rules as indicated in the draft enclosed, in which a redraft of sub-rule (2) of rule 1 is proposed. . 3. I am to add that consequent on the amendment of rule 6 (1') of the Medical Attendance Rales, communicated with the India O lice letter No S. &amp; G.- 5086-39, dated the 25th August, 1939, rule 6 (2) requires amendment to allow a patient, sent to an anti-rabic treatment centre under clause (a) of sub-rule (1), to claim travelling allowance for the journey to the centre. ♦With a copy of the correspondence with the Secretary of State to the Auditor-General.4-. I am to request that the Secretary of State may be moved to make the necessary amendments to the rules.

Some Departments of the Government of India continue to send their indents for publications to the India Office in contravention of the instructions conveyeo in the late I. &amp; L. Department's 0. M. Nos. A .436 and A.638, dated 21st April. 1926, and 24th June, 1926, respectively. This practice should be discontinued forthwith. (b) Departments are requested to inform the iigh Commissioner for India of the subjects in which they are interested giving him the type of publications they would like to have and intimate to him the names of Societies. Bureaus, etc., in whose publications they are likely to be interested so that he may keep in touch with such bodies, forward a monthly or quarterly list of the publications Issued by such bodies to the Departments concerned for selection. The High Commissioner should have discretion to obtain and send at onee these publications which he thinks will be of interest to a particular Department# 2. In war time there are grave difficulties publications and in despatching them to India. This difficulty will, however, disappear with the improvement ^ conditions and the High Commissioner for India will do his best to obtain the publications Indented for by the Departments. Sd. A. C.

Sir, • I am directed to refer to this Department letter No. RE-1(7) dated the 17th April, 1945, and to say that the following arrangements have now been completed in connection with the working of the Employment Exchanges : - (1) Card Index envelopes for every man and woman discharged or released from the Services are being completed at Release Centres and despatched to the Employment Exchanges, which will thus have complete information about the released Servicemen and women residing within their area. (2) a Special India Army Order has been published instructing Services personnel who wish to contact civilian employers while still in the Services to send their particulars to the Central Employment Exchange, Labour Department. The Central Exchange is arranging to bring the names of such applicants to the notice of prospective employers. Government and private. (S) Arrangements have been made for the completion of Card Index envelopes in respect of persons discharged from concerns under or working for the Supply Department and similar arrangements are being made in respect of concerns under other Departments o^Government of India. The completed Card Index envelopes will be sent to the Employment Exchange concerned. 2. In addition to information regarding demobilised Services personnel and discharged war-workers seeking civil employment, it is equally important that the Employment Exchange should have information regarding the vacancies in Government service. On receiving intimation of a vacancy, the Employment Exchange will submit a list of qualified men on its register to the appointing authority concerned which will inform the Employment Exchange of the names of candidates selected by it for interview. The Employment Exchange will then ask the selected candidates to appear before the appointing authority lor interview on the date and place fixed for the purpose. 3. In the case of posts advertised by officers of the Provincial Government or by a Public Service Commission, if a copy of the advertisement is sent to the Regional or Sub-Regional Employment Exchange concerned, it will bring the vacancy to the notice of qualified candidates and invite them to apply to the appropriate authority if they so desire. This will ensure that all qualified ex-Servicemen get timely information regarding vacancies in Government posts for which they are qualified. 4 • • . . \ v_X 4. The final selection of candidates In all cases will be made by the appointing authority. The use of the Employment Exchange machinery in connection with appointments to Governmert posts does not thus imply any interference with the usual procedure for filling Government posts, 6. It will greatly facilitate the work of Employment Exchanges viz: to assist employers to find the most suitable persons and to assist the employment seekers to find the most suitable employment expeditiously if all vacancies in Governmen service are notified to the Sub-Regional Employment Exchange concerned. If the Sub-Regional Exchange in the area has not been established this information may be sent to the Regional Exchange, 6. The Government of India will be grateful if the Provincial Government will issue the necessary instructions to all appointing authorities asking them to make the fullest use of the Employment Exchange machinery, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd, N, C.

FA^T AIR MAIL Sir, I am directed to inform you that, in view of the elimina tion of financial adjustments between the Government of India ana H. M. G. under the Defence Expenditure Plan, claims are not Ministry in respect of air passages sponsored by the india Office or the High Commissioner for India, the 0aarge for which can be classified as coming under the heading of Deience. Air passages, the charge for which cannot be so classified, however, continue to be the subject of Departments adjustment and claims for the cost of such passages are made by. and paid to, the Air Ministry. * 4.u 2 l has accordingly ^een arranged with the Air Ministry that all requisitions for air passages submitted to the Air priorities Joard by the India Office or the High Commissioner for India should show clearly how the cost involved should be charged, i.e. whether to British Government Funds or Indian Revenues. 3. It has now been brought to notice that a number of air passages on Indian account originate in the Middle East and the Air Ministry wishes, if possible, to introduce, in that sphere, arrangements similar to those which operate in this country U wnereby such officially sponsored passages should be provided without charge by the B. 0. A. C. if their cost can be classified as coming under the heading of Defence. 4. There is no representative of this Office, or the High * Commissioner for India, in Cairo competent to decide whether lu ^ 0 £ an , alr passage can be classified as coming under the heading of Deience or not and it is believed that the Government of India also have no representative there competent to make this decision. ^ 5. I am to enquire, therefore, whether it would be possible to arrange for military or civil officers who proceed on duty from India to the Middle East, to be provided with a document showing clearly whether, for any Journeys they may be required to perform by air In the Middle East and their return Journey J?? !? ? r ? nwar ? Journey to some other destination, they are ^ entitled to travel at the public expense, and if 'so, whether the cost of such Journeys is chargeable to Indian or British Revenues. This document, on being presented to the Air Ministry^ RepresentaUy. in the Middle East would enable him to decide whether the required passages could be arranged without charge of, if not, whether they should be charged to Indian Revenues. I am to request the favour of an early reply. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Financial Secretary. Copied. G. A.M.Regr.

Subject l DELHI UNIVERSITY - OPENING OP THE DEPARTMENT OP RUSSIAN LANGUAGE. I am directed to address you regarding the establishment of a Department of Russian Language at the University of Delhi. 2. The Government of India have had under consideration for some time past the question of the inclusion of the Russian language in the curriculum of Degree and Post-Graduate teaching in Indian Universities. At the present time there is absolutely no arrangement for the teaching of the Russian language in any of the Universities in India. Early in 1945 the matter was referred to the Central Advisory Board of Education and later to the Inter University Board, India, who consulted the Indian Universities. The proposal was welcomed by some of the Indian Universities but the scheme could not be undertaken by them mainly for want of necessary funds. With the end of the war and the close association of the Allies with Russia, the question of making adequate arrangements for the teaching of the Russian language has again been brought to the notice of the Government of India. Indian traders arefLikely to have a greater contact with Russia than before the war, which will mean that a good number of Indian students will have to learn the language, and to study Russian Literature, Economics, History and Contemporary conditions in Russia. After careful consideration of the matter and in consultation with the Vice-Chancellor, Delhi University, the Government of India have decided to establish a Department of Russian Language at the Delhi University, which will be open to bona fide students of the University as well as persons in private or Government service desiring to pursue the course of studies. In view of the great interest evinced by the students generally in Russia and things Russian, it is expected that a fair number of students will take advantage of this facility. To start with, the facilities for Russian studies will be restricted to the Elementary Study of the Russian Language with effect from the forthcoming academic year. 3. The entire cost of this Department will be met by the Government of India by making a grant to the Delhi University. For the year 1946-47 provision has been made for a non recurring grant of 8s 26,000 and a recurring grant of Ss 10,000 to the University as per schedule attached herewith. 4. It may be necessary for certain Departments of the Government of India to depute some of their officers to take advantage of the facilities thus made available for the teaching of Russian Language while some of the officers employed under the Central Government may of their own accord like to study the language. I am to request that special arrangements may be made to suit the requirements of Government servants in the matter. Copied.

In the United Kingdom f has made arrangements under which a limited number of businessmen, or their representatives, with established interests in property in Germany or substantial holdings of their own or their Company in German concerns or undertakings may visit the British Zone of Germany for the purpose of inspecting their proper ties and evaluating the present position and future prospects of the German business concerned. These arrangements do not extend to persons wishing to visit Germany on the grounds that they claims to own property confiscated by the Nazis or subjected to such measures as forced sales as a result of Nazi discriminatory legislation. 2. The present shortage of transport and accommodation imposes a severe restriction on the number of visits permissible, and priority has to be given to those applicants whose presence will be of use to the Control Commission in that the efficient running of their German business is important to the need of Military Govern ment, the Occupying Forces or the German economy. The present overall maximum of visitors to the British Zone is 30 at any one time, though this number can be increased by another 30 if they can provide their own transport. Within this number, however, provi sion has to be made for visitors of U.S., French and other Allied or Neutral nationality. 3. Reciprocal arrangements are being made with the Commanders of the U.S. and French Zones for the entry of British and Dominions Businessmen into the area under their control. 4. Visits will be for not more than one months duration, but it is expected that many visitors will be able to conclude their business in a much shorter time than this. 5. Applications of businessmen intending to visit Germany should be addressed to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, Simla, who would forward them to the India Office, London, for consideration with a view to securing necessary facilities.

There shall be no direct communication of any kind between the provincial Governments in India and, in Pakistan, except (1) on matters (') (iii) ■(1) on matters of a purely routine nature; and (2) up tothe Slst March 1948 in regard to partition matters between the Goverhments of East and West Bengal and Assam and the Governments of Eastern and Western Punjab, (c): There shall be no direct correspondence between a Province ^ in India and the Central Government of Pakistan and viee versa.

The undersigned Is directed to Invite a reference to para (I)(a)(i) of this Ministry's Office Memorandum No,F,II(16)-E,11/46 d ated the 7th April 1947, under which no dearness allowance (formerly cost of living: allowance) Is admissible to officers on leave preparatory to retirement spent out of India. Due to constitutional changes (consequent on the transfer of Power) however, certain officers who originally proceeded on leave with the intention of returning to duty at the expiry of the leave had to given up the idea of rejoining duty. It is legitimate to hold that these officers could have exercised the option not to remain In service only after 16,8,1947, It has, therefore, been decided that in the case of officers who proceeded on le^ve ex-India before 16,8.47 other than leave preparatory to retirement and who retired from service without rejoining duty, / the dearness al^ow nee drawn up to 16,8,47 need not be recovered.
