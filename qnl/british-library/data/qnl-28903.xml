They counted the bags from the Treasury but refused to count the -.otes and the Cash and Notes in the hands of the Cashier. At about 2 p.m. mules were brought and the money and notes taken to the German Consuls quarters. While waiting for the mules to arrive I pointed out the difficulty the British Colony would be in without money, and Krs. 20,000 were f replaced in the Treasury for our use. Mr. Cachick then asked for a further sum for payment of the salaries of the Native Staff and the Nickel Coin Krs. 4,000 was given back for this purpose. These sums of course remain in the Bank’s books. Soon after the arrival of the Germans at the Bank I was allowed to telephone to my wife at the house and succeeded in conveying to her the inform ation that the Germans had seized the Bank and were taking all the cash; this information she immediate ly sent to Mr. Meriton the Acting Vice Consul who lives close to the Bank house. Mr, Meriton immediately sent to the Acting Governor. The Ferash Bashi of the Bank was outside the Bank when the Germans rushed the Bank. within a few minutes he personally saw the Acting Governor and informed him of ..hat had happened. Thus early notice was given to the Governor of what was happening and no attempt was made to prevent the Germans removing the cash from the Bank, About one p.m. the Chief of Police arrived at the Bank, had an interview withthe Germans and left. We have good evi.dence that Obiore the mermans came to the Bank they had a lariK.hy interview with the Acting Governor and came straiglit from his room to the Bank. The Germans informed us that they intended to accompany hr. .icol and myself to our houses hut we did not leave the Bank until after 4 p.m. when we were taken up to the British Telegraph houses and the Telegraph Office was seized. The subsequent events viz:- . The destruction of the British Telegraph Office. A Meeting of the Englishmen of the Community with the Acting Governor. The reported arrival of 250 Turkish troops. A private warning from one of the Germans that the British should leave as soon as possible. The flight of the British to the Governor's house. The agitation of the Democrats and the Acting Governor for the departure of the British from Yezd, calls for no remark in this report. While living at the Governor's house we went down to the Bank under guard and removed the books and opened a temporary office at the Governor's house. Here we prepared accounts and collected most of our local outstandings before proceeding to Teheran. On 23rd December we again went to the Bank and placed all the Bank records in the Treasury. We removed the Krs. 20,000 which had been left by the Germans together with the cancelled notes and notes of other offices which we brought to Teheran. The nickel Coin Krs. 4,000 remains in the Treasury, The Treasury door and outer doors of the Bank were then sealed by the Acting British Vice Consul, the Chief jlet of Police, as representative of the Governor, and myself. I^QhTZl BUPhlNG OF TH E STOLEN NOTES . On j ne 14tn Decemte r onwar d s, many reports, several of them reliable, were brought to me that one nooes stolen by the Germans had been burnt by them. About the 20th December I was asked to see biie u-erman Bernsuoff in the Acting Governor’s room before the Acting Governor relative to the cost of some overcoats etc. which the followers of the Germans had stolen from the Bank and for which, being private property, the Germans were anxious to pay compensation. In course of conversation Bernstoff assured me that the notes had been burnt with the exception of some of the hundred toman notes one of which had been given to each' of their men present at the Bank on the day of the robbery. I could obtain no convincing reason why the notes had been burnt and although I have good reason to believe that some notes were burnt I am not prepared on the evidence to believe that all the notes were burnt.

In my acting as Commander I have seized the Imperial Bank of Persia, Yezd Branch, and have there taken over the following amounts Krs. 549,500 in cash (fifty four thousand nine hundred fifty tomans) plus all the Banknotes in the treasury and notes and a small sum of cash in hands of the Cashier. The full amount of money found was Krs. 569,500. I have left from this Krs. 20,000 (two thousand tomans) cash money for the personal expense of the Manager and his family. Besides this I have handed back Krs. 4,000 (four hundred tomans) for salary of the native Bank Clerks. The code of the Bank has been seized too. (Signed) H. Wallman Oberleutnant. )Jote . Original of this receipt has been deposited with the Bank in Teheran.the IMPERIAL BAI'IK OF PERSIA, B U S H I R E, 27th February, 1916. 14' dear Mr. Newell:- Au last I have been able to get some authentic news of Shiraz. One of their clerks, a Mr. Aron Trarable has arrived here in Bushire, having left Shiraz about a month ago. Previously his sister had asked me to take him on here as there was a danger of Armenians - he is an Armenian being massacred by the rebel Gendarmes. I was in sore need of another experienced clerk and this, coupled with a desire for news, decided me to engage him. He reports that a week after the European Colony were expelled, the Gendarmery sought out trie members of the local staff and ordered them to take up their duties at the Bank - should they refuse, violence was threatened. One Agha Mohd. Ali Saraff with Herr Roever were appointed as joint managers - but the fomer only attended the office for a few days and Roever was left in sole charge. Mr. Tramble states that when the Bank was seized there was about Ts. 137,000 in the Treasury - the Gendarmery almost at once took a tt loan ,, of Ts. 50,000-for which they are supposed to pay 12 % interest and against a receipt for the amount. When the fighting between the Gavan (the Governor) and the Gendarmery was taking place, the latter extracted a further Ts. 7,000 from the Treasury.me 'rank” at once started paying notes which cleared out the rest of-the Treasury - about Ts. 80,000 notes were encashed by the Public. Owing to lack of funds the “Bank' then collected by force all outstanding bills in their portfolios, clients nen also to liquidate their overdrafts in Current accounts; all those who did not pay up were put into prison. Haji Mohd. Mehdy Isp. Lallal, whom ^ou of course know well by name, was incarcerated for a few days, until he had ma.de arrangements to reduce his liabilities which amounted to, I hear, some Ts. 16,000. v&lt;nen ar. Tramble left on the 26th January, the Books were all intact but destruction was threatened owing to the fact that the British had burnt the offices of Robt. Wonckhaus and Company at Basra. The latter statement is entirely untrue for when I was in Basra some five weeks ago, the offices of Wonckhaus were being used for the Military Governor, his staff and for other purposes. All documents in the Bank have been copied end will, I presume, find their way into German archives. Herr Roever, who is also acting as German Consul in Shiraz, informed the staff that a. German Bank would shortly be established - he apparently treated the staff well and they were paid regularly. The 'Bank” is not conducting any business, with the exception of collecting outstanding acceptances of the I.B.P'. This departure obviously for placing the Gendarmery in funds, when all out standings have come in, the 'Bank”, I presume, will automatically cease to exist. Theine Onager’s £®id Accountant's houses are occupied, by the Gendarraery who have placed a guard b ‘ it ' f ’ 13 not thought that they have been looted, 1jUC ' 3 Lia pretty sure that by now most of the valuables have been taken away. I have been trying to see what I can do to get at Hongkong Bank in Bombay to obtain a refundment of kran bills purchased by them on Shiraz for the latter's account; owing to many of the posts being- looted Bombay have' not received advices of payment. P suggested to them that they a.sk the sellers of those bills to communicate with the drawees in oiiii -c and uo request them to forward the discharged cills to Bombay for inspection; we should then be able to see which of the bills were actually collected by the I.B.P. and which by the present 'Bank'. Bombay wrote and asked me if they should take legal steps in the matter; I informed them that I did not think this desirable for obviously we cannot obtain any proof that these outstanding bills are unpaid - they are paid all right now but to the wrong BankJ.'.' When and if the discharged bills are eventually produced, we shall know where we are. If there is any more information required, will you kindly let me know and I will endeavour to obtain what I can.

In view of recent events and conduct of Bakhtiaris at Ispahan it is mani festly impossible to attempt to get another Khan appointed to replace him. Moreover Russians would not agree to it and with their troops at Kashan and in possession of Kermanshah we cannot well oppose their candidate for a post in their sphere of influence. Their present candidate is Akbar Mirza with whom we are on excellent terms and I am confident he is too intelligent to make unnecessary trouble. I am telling Khans here they have only Ashja and themselves to thank for present situation. Repeated Cox. Ends. Repeated Foreign, Bushire and Grahame who will please show Noel.

To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. A Baluch lashkar under brother of Jehind is reported from Robat to have entered British territory between Humai and Saindak and to have carried off a large caravan: it is probable that it passed on into Afghanistan. It is reported by Major Heron from Dehanehbaghi that there is now no trace at Bam of three Germans (see telegram No. S. K. D -72, dated January 12th, from Officer Commanding, Kacha Koh, to Chief of General Staff, Delhi) and 400 sowars who recently came there. He thinks that they have returned to Kerman but possibly they have gone South-East in order to follow lashkar into Afghanistan. There may even have been some Germans with latter. At any rate it seems quite possible that they have taken this route. As we have supplies for approximately 6 months at Kacha Koh there is no possibility of sending reinforcements or of sending present garrison forward to Bam and Kerman ! In order to strengthen our blockade along Lut perhaps it would be possible to induce Russians to send troops down to Naiband and Birjand. Germans are, I believe, short of money and it is unlikely that their Persian levies will fight hard. Addressed to Foreign. Telegram P., No. 132-F., dated the 2nd (received 3rd) March 1916.

From—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated Minister.) Details of what we have been able to provide for Kawam are contained in my telegram immediately following. Difficulty is as follows :— He has about 5,000 men armed with German rifles for which neither he nor we have got or can obtain any ammunition, and barely 1,000 men armed with British pattern rifles. Unless 4,000 or 6,000 -rv.ceab e Bnhsh r fle with 1,000,000 rounds ammunition can be supplied by the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government he cannot be adequately equipped regards small arms. Would it be possible to arrange this . I have ascertained from Kawam what his plans are. He must collect his tribesmen before they commence their usual Spring migration t. h la d^ about a fortnight hence and therefore cannot delay. Provided that he Units he has sufficient ammunition he intends first to recover Lar and to advance thence to Fasa where he expects to get most of his following. If possible he will march on Shiraz from there. We are giving him 6 Indian non-commissioned officers who will be dressed as Persians to manage his guns.$ For following reason which seems sensible he has decided after mature consideration that it will be better not to take a British officer. Hitherto Germans have succeeded in making their adherents believe that their proceedings are approved by Persian Government. Consequently if Kawam is accompanied by a British officer enemy will continue to say that he has not support of Persian Government and that he is only a tool of the British who are using him for their own purposes. On othei hand it Ivawam is conveyed from here in Persian vessel “ lersepolis and his munitions of war are landed from her and no English contingent is with him he thinks that hostile elements will then cease to believe German lies and will desert them and will believe that he really is supported by and representative of Persian Government. According to our information Gendarmes in Ears do not exceed 1,000. Minister says that there are 1,50 J effective men. On the other hand it is contended by Kawam that there are nearer 8,000 and doubtless hostile contingent from Ispahan may possibly come on to Shiraz. He relies on moral effect of guns, etc., to keep Gendarmes neutral and overawe enemy but does not hope to be actively supported by former. He is confident that his tribesmen will support him but if any serious opposition is encountered issue will be decided by amount of small arms and ammunition at disposal of the two parties and Kawam is in this respect deficient. He will go to Fasa in any case wdiere his position will be strong and if on arrival at that place there seems to be a reasonable prospect of success he will make an attempt to recover Shiraz otherwise he will remain at Fasa. Towards the release of prisoners he cannot for the present do anything. 23 Telegram P., No. 415-D. S., dated the 6th March 1916. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. (Repeated to Baluchistan.) Trevor telegraphs on 4th instant, No. 524, as follows. It is repeated to you for information. Begins. German agents sowars and foot soldiers. End of message. 24 Telegram P., No. 33, dated the 6th (received 7th) March 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Repeated to Sir P. Cox, Bushire.) ; Please see Cox’s telegram 526. Reasons advanced by Kawam for dispensing with the services of a British officer seem to me to be wholly insufficient. That absence of such an officer wdll suffice to disprove German stories that awam is our tool or induce belief that he has support not only of ourselves but of Persian Government seems to me most unlikely. It wvmld be impos sible for Kawam to represent that he does not rely on us after his visit to Bushire and return with guns and ammunition which every one knows cannot be supplied by Persian Government and moreover he has been our main Persian supporter. The fact of his sailing on “ Persepolis ” would prove nothing as without our consent she could not move. $ I suggest on the contrary that Germans will say that we are abandoning Kawam unless he returns without every patent sign of our support. O1 Germans will surely endeavour to misrepresent whatever line we adopt to their own advantage and therefore strongest line is in my opinion best. More over near future will probably see weakening of German influence in South. Truth concerning situation in North and at Tehran is gradually filtering South and it will be difficult to explain away flight of Germans from Ispahan. Impending Russian occupation of which place will give their friends food for reflection. Cannot Kaw'am be detained long enough to meet Sykes and discuss with him plan indicated in India Office telegram repeated to me in Foreign Office telegram 103, March 1st, where object of His Majesty’s Government is dis^ cribed as being to support Kawam by all possible means in his endeavour to recover Shiraz, etc. I consider that general plan outlined in that telegram is most practical and that close co-operation between Sykes and Kawam is of first importance. 25 Telegram P., No. 545, dated (and received) the 7th March 1916. From—The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated to Tehran.) When your 409-1). S., communicating Secretary of State’s telegram of March 2nd was despatched you had doubtless not considered my telegram No. 520. In view of policy outlined in former I have again discussed plans with Kawam but there is little fresh to add. When I pressed Kawam as to whether his intentions were serious he reiterates that cause oi his retirement from Shiiaz was not defection of his tribesmen but lack of guns and the iact that he had used up his ammunition j and that in addition to his well-known Anglo-phil views there is the fact that Germans and Gendarmerie have damaged his propertv to the extent of crores of krans and have looted everything he pos sesses ; ‘consequently we can rely absolutely on his complete accord with us in determination to* be revenged on Germans and to expel them trom the country. But he repeats that his success depends entirely on his returning to his tribesmen before the migration commences and that presence with mm of British officers without any British force will only embarrass him. On the other hand he will welcome deputation of officers for purpose indicated when once he is established at Shiraz and he will co-operate with them m every way. The proposal to locate force at Bunder Abbas would not, he thinks, afreet his present plans one way or the other and he has no active desire for it but it mio*ht react favourably on Kerman situation. What would really help him considerably, he says, would be some simultaneous sign of activity on the part of our troops at Bushire. I am communicating my views un this subject to you in a separate telegram. Kawam will leave a representative behind who will meet Sykes at Bunder Abbas with Darya Begi, but as we have now given him all the munitions ot war we can and as it is impossible to arrange any concerte ac ion him and Sykes he considers that advantages that might accrue from meeting will be outweighed by prejudice to his interests which e vou ris y delaying five or six days to meet Sykes. In this view I concur. I have given Kawam odd sums in cash and he now asks that amount be made up to £30,000 which will, he consider, enabie him to recover Shira or last him for two months.

Castelli and Brothers, whose head- quarters are in New York in the United States of America. On or about the 11th of December last a great excitement arose amongst the popuktion of Kerman who openly threatened me and all other Europeans with Yiolence arid death unless we departed forthwith. As a matter of fact the Persian broker whom my firm employed was wounded by the infuriated populace In consequence I took refuge at the British Consulate where I resided till the 17th of December on which day I left for Bunder Abbas together with all other Europeans under the guidance and protection of the British Consul. After twenty-five days’ journey I reached Bunder Abbas and have been embarked there on board the British Transport “ Bankura ” together with other refugees and have been brought to Bombay on the 19th instant. In support of what is stated above I have the honour to annexe herewith a Certificate granted to me by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and I take this opportunity of expressing my sincerest thanks and gratitude to him for thus saving my life from an infuriated and fanatic mob, and shall always in duty pray for His Majesty the King and the British nation that have always been looked upon in the East as our protectors and benefactors. Having stated the circumstances under which I find myself in Bombay I beg now to approach you with the prayer that I may be allowed to depart from Bombay and to proceed to New York by whichever route the Government may be pleased to prescribe to me. Being a salaried man and having regard to the circumstances under which I left Kerman, I find myself with limited means, and unless I am allowed to proceed to America to rejoin my service I shall be left here penniless and depending upon the generosity and charity of my Greek Compatriots. The technical point of my being born in Turkey and nominally being a Turkish subject does not escape me, I hope however that my position will be considered in a liberal spirit and in accordance with the view taken by the Home Government which at the commencement of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire, by Boyal Decree declared that Ottoman subjects of Greek nationality should not be treated as hostile enemies. Thanking you in anticipation of a favourable decision and apologising for the length of this petition. Sub-Enclosure. This is to certify that Menalaos H.

By your present telegram his deputation is placed in a different aspect. As now enunciated I have nothing to say against scheme on its merits, but it should be clear to Government of India that Sykes’ residing at Bunder Abbas or in the neigh bourhood recruiting for Military Police will be of no practical help to Kawam or (his friends ?) before next cold weather and we must leave Sykes out of our calculation as far as they are concerned. I will defer specific proposal regard ing Kawam until after interview as the Kawam is shortly expected at the coast. If Kawam presses for services of a military officer to remain with him and assist him in organising his forces and if prospects seem sufficiently good, deputation of suitable officer ad hoc will, I trust, be considered. Demi-official. If the services of either of them are available, may I in that contingency suggest Major C. B. Stokes, Captain D. R. Oliver, Captain W. I. S. Meiklejohn. 185 Telegram P., No. 359-D.

With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram No. 10-F., dated the 27th January iD16, on the sub ject of the Governorship of Kainat and Sis tan, I have the honour to enclose copies of the marginally noted correspondence. 2. On the 21st January I had asked Mr. New by ‘ log ’ telegram to tell the Governor that though I had written to him very unfavourably about his 3 mili tary Commanders I might still modify my opinion about them, if they showed themselves ready at once to make arrange ments for catching the Germans. 3. I should explain that His Excellency was previously well aware of my opinion about the 3 men, as I had already showm to him last winter that I considered that two of them were unworthy of their appointments owing to the fact that they had shown themselves unwilling to meet even the Sarhaddis and Afghan robbers to deal with whom they had been brought to Sistan. I had also accused them a few weeks ago of being all pro-German. 4. The letter and telegram from His Excellency, of which translations are attached, show, I fear, that there is no hope of the present Governor allying himself informally with our side. I doubt even if he would be happy to do so should his Government openly declare w'ar against Turkey and her allies. 5. His Excellency has been ill with fever for several days past and he has still to reply to my telegram of the 2nd instant (possibly delivered to him on 4th), but I do not expect him to change his attitude. 6. In these circumstances, I presume that we are committed to the policy of trusting Hisam-ud-Dauleh to co-operate openly and loyally with us against the Germans and Turks. Personally I view the future with misgiving, as I have not been favoured with any information as to why the Russians feel so confident in the sincerity of their friend and in his power to make the troops and people of Kainat assist us materially. 1.

Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 194. Translation of a letter from Shaukat-ul-Malk to His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Si st an and Rain, dated 19th Babi I, 1334 (25th January 1916). After Compliments.—I have received your letter of the 11th Rabi 1 (17th January) and am very pleased to hear about your good health. You had informed me of the messages interchanged between yourself and His Britannic Majesty’s Minister and had asked my opinion. Firstly, I am very grateful and thankful to you for this kindness. Secondly, I state in reply, that howsoever you may ponder over the matter, you will find no proofs of my deviation from friendship with British officials or of my inclination towards the Germans. I stated before this, and I repeat now, that in official affairs I am obedient to the orders of my Government, but in private affairs I am the friend of the British Government’s officials. Tip to now the preservation of a strict neutrality has been seen everywhere on the part of my Government, and orders to this effect were being received and I was complying with them as was fitting from a well-wisher of the Government and of the Persian nation. Now that orders are being received that I should stop instigations by the German parties, indeed I am, to the extent of my power, taking necessary steps to search out the modes of their communications, e g., to discover the places of their staying and their ways of crossing through the country, and to destroy their communications and I will stop them. If clearer instructions are also received from the Government, immediate steps will of course be taken. This is my idea which I have stated without any reserve. I state, however, that if His Britannic Majesty’s Minister wishes to replace me by Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh at the desire of the Russian Minister, I shall not be grieved at all, because indeed he must consider the furthering of the Govern ment’s objects to be in this w'ay ; and nothing further can be said. After explaining my views as I have done, I state briefly below my replies to the other sentences:— (1) British Government officers, since the time of Major Sykes and thereafter, have always been and are my friends. I have always safeguarded my friendship with them and will do so, and I do not suppose that a different idea will ever enter my mind.. I am also very grateful for the kindness shown by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister two years ago. (2) I have been, and am, obedient to orders of my Government. .When the inclination of the Persian Government is known, it is not needed to ascertain my inclination. (3) You may kindly specify what are the convincing proofs which I should give. . . _ _ . (4) I do not think that Colonel Ali Naqi Khan, Basir-i-lS izam or Prince Mohamed Taqi Mirza are pro-Germans, because they are at present my subordinates, and if you can satisfy yourself about me you may rest assured about them too. . Apart from this they have not got so much influence among their men (as to he able to lead them contrary to my wishes). I say only this much in conclusion, that regarding the fear of the Germans, which you impute to me in your second paragraph, I do not admit it at all, and so far I have never had any fear in any way nor do 1 now have it, because my nature is somewhat repugnant to this attribute. The remarks which I have made in this letter you will I hope convey to the Minister. I consider a separate representation to him would be lacking in respect to you.

Although my illness prevents me from being able to pen a suitable reply and my view is the same as I stated in my letter, dated 18th instant (21th January), yet notwithstanding great illness I cannot let your communication remain without a reply longer than this. I have never kept German messengers with me ; I haie seen no German messenger and I do not know any. In case such report has been received by you it is desirable that you should specify the author of it, so that a correct reply may be given. Mirza Syed Mohsin Khan, as long as he was here, was recognized by me as Finance Agent, Kainat, and not as a German agent or paid”servant. Now also, to my knowledge, he is still in the Revenue Depart ment in Meshed and serving the Persian Government. It astonishes me that you wrote that my going to Gib with him for shooting has become a matter. of suspicion. I would have been very grateful had I been informed how suspicion has been engendered in this trip of mine. As to Persian troops under my command having acted against British troops on several occasions, I. cannot remember anything worthy of consideration having happened and being left undeait with. If you remember any case you may kindly let me know. As to your statement that Winckelmann has said that a month ago Wagner, a German, went to Afghanistan via the south of Birjand. Firstly, if in reality such a person had passed through these places, why did the British Government Sepoys, who are stationed at all places, not arrest them ? Secondly, I have not received any order up to the present to arrest Germans. A week ago I asked my Government authorities clearly for instructions, and if an order for Germans’ arrest is received, I shall of course take energetic action to arrest them. * With regard to your suggestion that I should arrest a few German mes sengers I am not in this place free to do what I like and I cannot conduct the Government affairs according to my personal inclination. I am obedient to7 the orders of my Government. Now that friendly relations exist between the Persian Government and the British and Russian Governments, why are not these pressures exerted upon the Persian Government, so that an order may he issued to me from them and I be deprived of excuses for not taking action energetically ? I imagine that you must, in reality, approve of my rendering obedience to my Government in State affairs and continuing the friend of the British in personal matters. 195 Telegram P., No. 45-C., dated (and received) the 21st February 1916.

Present Deputy Governor sent a message to Tehran on January 3rd and Hisam wants to summon him to Birjand and ask him about it but I think that the matter will be amicably arranged. The proposal that the Karguzar should be temporarily appointed Deputy Governor is accepted by him. The two Sardars should he told to send 200 sowars between them to Birjand under Haidar Ali Khan. Other sowars should be collected in case of need later but on arrival at distination he will telegraph about this. You should warn them not to entice your men from you. Please see my telegram 19-C., of the 11th February. Hisam is anxious for remittance. . , . , I am probably sending Doctor Fath Ali Khan with Hisam as he Eiay he useful to you.

Owing to possible defection of Baharlus possibility of attack on Bunder Abbas, vide my telegram No. 235, Deputy Governor of that place wishes to engage 200 riflemen at a cost of 1,600 tomans monthly. This seems reasonable precaution and I propose to recommend it to Darya Begi. The cost will, however, swallow up practically all Bunder Abbas surplus revenue this Persian year and most of surplus next year as long as riflemen are retained. Bunder Abbas remittances to Bushire will be reduced in consequence to zero and corresponding additional sum be required here either from Persian Govern ment or as advance from us to keep Local Government going.

My telegram 57-259. Bushire finances. At my last interview with him Governor personally pressed on me urgent necessity for funds. Hitherto His Excellency has preferred to send messages or draft telegrams to Persian Government. The fact that he has been compelled to overcome his reluctance to beggings in person shows, I think, to what straits he is reduced. I beg some arrangement may be made without delay. I may mention that owing to anarchy in interior and stoppage of goods going up country local Customs receipts are rapidly falling off and this source of supply will probably soon dry up. Director of Customs anticipates that if matters do not speedily take turn for better he will before long have difficulty in finding funds for departmental expenses. For this reason venture to suggest best arrangement would be systematic of advances to make good local deficits to be eventually recovered from Persian Government. Total cost of administration is some 5,000 tomans monthly but receipts amounting to possibly half expenditure would he set off against this. Sent to Tehran; repeated to Eoreign, Basrah. ! s. G. P.

Apparently the reopening of communication was due to the fact that Wazir Khidhar, who had been away for about a fortnight possibly with Wassmuss, returned to Ahram on the 8 th January. When the messenger went hack in the morning of the 15th instant, I sent a note to Major O’Connor returning the two letters sent by Mr. Wassmuss, and requested Major O’Connor to inform Mr. Wassmuss that if he wishes to obtain information regarding, or communicate with, Germans interned in India, he should do so through the recognized channels, viz.) his own Government.

He therefore called in about 100 of his followers from Shahr-i-Babak and on my invitation and advice he left the house lent to him by the Imam-i- Juma and came to the Consulate. Por some days he only went out escorted by some of his men or stayed in the Consulate grounds. The day before his murder he came to me and said that his relation, the Deputy Governor, had asked him to go to lunch and that he had accepted. I told him to take an escort of his men with him, to return early in the after noon and by a different way to that by which he went. Just before dusk I was given a message telephoned by him from the town to the effect that he was going on to a Mujliss which would keep him late and that he would return to the Consulate in the morning. I learnt afterwards that he had been persuaded by the Iftikhar-i-Sadat, a man with a bad reputation, to spend the night in his house. In the morn ing early without waiting for an escort to come for him the Iftikhar sent him off on a donkey with only a servant walking in front. Just before he reached the gate of the town a man who had been hiding in a shop close by ran out and shot him at close range w ith a Mauser pistol. He was curried up to Assistant Surgeon Steinhoff’s house which was not far from the gate at which he had been shot. Mr. Steinhoff did what he could for him and sent at once for Dr. Dodson who arrived shortly afterwards but there was no hope from the first and he only lingered about an hour. There is no doubt that the Iftikhar’s invitation and its consequences were all part of a plot formed by the Democrats and encouraged by the Germans to whose house the murderer fled for protection. 129 Telegram P., No. 277, dated the 3rd (received 4th) February 1916.

Without regarding previous telegrams, from the 12th Safar (21st December) up to now I^have submitted three telegrams to you by way of the line at Bunder Ahbas, and am awaiting Your Excellency’s reply. A thousand of the houses of myself and my relatives and dependents have been plundered by the Gendarmerie, and more than 5 millions (tumans ?) of property carried off, while the Gendarmes have been placed in the houses. If a Government military administration commit such acts rebelliously, and fitting reparation is not made by the Government, and they are not sufficiently punished, this state of affairs will spread far and wide. Naturally should I despair of steps being taken by the Government I shall not refrain from my own retaliation, and as long as there is life in my body I shall strain every nerve. In that case whatever may be done by (?) in this country, I should not be blamed for it. The only fault which they have ascribed to me is this, that I have said that I was obedient to the orders of the Government: so much and not more. 2nd Rabi I ( 8 th January 1916).

I am sending this telegram from a place 3 farsakhs from Jahrum, According to news received from the town (Shiraz) after my depar ture, all my houses and those of my relatives and dependents, who accompany me about 1,000 houses have been plundered, and more than 10 crores (i.e. 5 million tumans ?) of property carried off. It is not fitting that after several generations of service to the Government, they should now bring this down on my head. It is a surprising sort of constitution. I am in the neighbourhood of Jahrum and Easa, and shall remain with the Arab II, and shall not cease to take revenge for myself. If the Govern ment remembers the services of my grandfathers and myself, it will cause the necessary steps to be taken against these men. Otherwise, in any case I shall myself use all my own endeavours, and whatever God has ordained will come to pass.

For some time now the Germans have been at Yazd and lately they have put up a wireless telegraphy installation in the Dowletabad garden with which they communicate with any part of the world they like. Two days ago the Germans went to the Bank and after going through the hooks, they plundered and carried off all it had. They then removed the Manager and his Assistant to the Consulate, which was surrounded three hours after sunset and all things therein were broken and destroyed. The people assembled at the cemetery yesterday and a speech was made by the head speaker containing three points — ( 1 ) The democrats and liberals have been reconciled, and are prepared to send away the foreigners from Persia. (2) The Persian Government have made an agreement with the Eussian and British Ministers and are ready to co-operate with them (Ministers). ( 3 ) The people of Yazd have telegraphed to Tehran that if the Sultan (Shah) wants to go against the Turkish Government, they (people) are ready to fight. An order was read that it is “ haram ” for children to go to English school. This order was read in the presence of all. The school has been stopped and none dares to go there. Apparently they will not allow the English to remain in Yazd. Enclo. 13 to Serial No. 140. Telegram No. 1721, dated the 16th January 1916. O 7 From—His Royal Highness Farman Farma, Prime Minister, Tehran, To— Zair Khidhar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan. (Not sent to addressees—A. P. T.) Whereas I entertain feelings of kindness for you, and the services rendered by your forefathers and ancestors are kept in view by the Government authorities, I feel it necessary to apprise you with the. real state of the country, and the injurious effects of the actions of certain ignorant men, and mischief-makers, who have been deceived by foreign Liras, and who have been led to make certain proclamations and demonstrations wmcn are altogether against the interests of the Government and ration and have ultimately brought the Eussian troops to the centre of the country and neigh bourhood of Kirmanshah and Kashan, while it is possible the troops might come down to Ispahan and still farther, if this state of things continues. To-day all the heads of tribes and individuals of the people must under stand this point, that the relations between the Persian Government and neighbouring Powers (Eussian and Britain) have been cordial since olden times, and will continue to be so in future. Any such rumours as may have been spread contrary to this fact are fundamentally sheer lies an e i er 1X1 cLU Ilf £1 C UF 6 s You will have heard of course that the Government have dismissed the Swedish officers, who took certain steps contrary to the orders and permission of the Government, and despatched a number of Gendarmes, whose duty was the maintenance of order in the country and obedience to the or ® rs ai1 ^ 1 the Government, and incited them to certain figutmg and con es s, contrary to their programme. They (the Government) will regar b y10 anv Gendarmes who have inTolred themselves in the fighting and of His Imperial Majesty may be directed towards you and he may count you as the faithful children of this country. You must know distinctly that if you take any other steps besides these arrangements, which are in the interests of the Government, the Nation and yourselves, they will be injurious both at present and in future, and that you will repent at a time when repentence will be of no avail. The rumour also which vou spread, that the Persian Government was going to war wirh the Turkish Government and Muhammadans is altogether baseless. The Persian Government is only desirous of maintaining its former relations with the Russian and British Governments, contrary to the actions of some ignorant persons, which are destructive to the country. Enclo. 14 to Serial No. 140. Telegram No. 1732, dated the 19th January 191C. From—His Royal Highness Fa*man Farma, Prime Minister, Tehran, To— Haidar Khan, Agha Khan of Lirawi and Muhammad Ali Khan of Shaban- kareh. According to reports received from inside and outside during this period when certain mischief-makers and ignorant men instigated by and greedy for foreign gold have spread certain rumours, and brought about causes of distur bance and tumult and trouble in the country, you have not taken part in the disturbance, in accordance with your great wisdom and loyalty to the Govern ment. You have carried out the orders of the Government very well, and kept your districts in order and tranquillity. This has caused the pleasure and satisfaction of the Government authorities and attracted the special favour of His Imperial Majesty towards you. Bravo: a thousand times ! M e are well pleased with you. As the relations between the Persian Government and’ the neighbouring Powers of Great Britain and Russia have been cordial from olden times, and its policy has been most friendly, and will be so in future, the Swedish officers of the Gendarmerie, who have mutinously interfered with the polit cs of the country and caused this revolution and breach of the public peace, have been dismissed from the service of the Government, and the Gendarmes, who had been enticed into the fighting and contest by the officers, have been declared outlaws and rebels, and will receive every punishment and penalty in due course. In view of this it is your duty to regard all the rumours spread by seditious parties and rebellious Gendarmes as pure foreigners, and to believe as before that your positions will be secure, and yourselves promoted by obedience to the orders of the Government. You should regard the putting into effect of the intentions of His Excellency Qawam-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor-General of Pars, as a condition of the fulfilment of your duties, and listen to the instruc tions of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and afford every assistance necessary to the steps taken by His Excellency in respect of the restoration of order in those parts. Know that any telegrams, which they send from Shiraz with the signature of His Royal Highness Nasrat -us-S11 Itaneh are all forgeries and manufactured, and that the relations between the Government and the Russian and British11 Governments are exceedingly good. You have done very, very well not to involve yourselves in certain proceedings, the result of which you will ulti mately see with your own eyes. Enclo. 15 to Serial No. 140. Telegram, dated the 19th (received 20th) January 1916. From—His Royal Highness Farman Farma, Prime Minister, Tehran, To—S oulet-ud-Dowleh, Sardar J Ashair (through Darya Begi, Bushire). Two days ago when I sent you a long telegram by the Company’s line, I had given you a sign, I now remember that I had that sign with the late Abdullah Khan, Soulet-us-Sultaneh. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I o-ive you the following sign for the day that early in the morning you and the late Bahadur-us-Sultaneh went to the house of Sardar Mu’atazid and thence came to see me. The telegram sent you have been from me, and I inform you once again that the mischief-makers, owing to the Liras which they have received from foreigners, have weakened the limbs of this country, and shaken the indepen dence of this State, and brought the Russian troops to the middle of this country, and on one side of Kirmanshah and Luristan. The only means for the deliverance of the country from these dangers is this that tbe influential men and heads of tribes, who care for the preservation of the independence of the country and the security of their private districts, should take energetic measures in order to extinguish the conflagration of trouble and sedition, so that the country may become tranquil, and the Government mav he able to propose to the neighbouring Powers to remove these troops gradually. Otherwise, if matters continue as they are, day by day the Russian troops will increase, and it is not improbable that they will proceed to Ispahan, and further. Moreover, the British Government is sending a force and supplies, and the horizon of this country will become a thousand times darker. As I have already hinted to vou, if you can proceed to Shiraz with your own forces, and not allow the Bank’s money to be removed, and disarm this number of Gendarmes, who withthe Swedish officers have already been dismissed from the Government service, and whose private soldiers have been declared guilty and outlaws and turn tom out, and bring about general public peace and release the British soldiers, who are imprisoned by Wassmuss and Shaikh Hussain, you will be rendering a great service to this land, the results of which will be beneficial to you in future. rfl sic srr 33 C b, telegram, aed no matter of support to you be omitted. iclo. 16 to Serial No. 140, Telegram, dated the 20th January 1916.

The other telegram should be worded as follows . “Khidhar Tangistani and Hussain Chahkutahi. For the sake of the receipt of Wassmuss liras you have disregarded Islam, and your Persian Nationality, and disobeyed the orders of the Government, and caused dis- the country. Therefore both of you are guilty, and condemned W the Government.

Enclo. 17 to Serial No. 140. Telegram No. 1775 (received 21st January 1916). F rom _His Royal Highness Fakman Farma, Prime Minister, Tehran, rji 0 jj is Excellency SoUlet-ud-Dewleh, Sardar •’Ashair (through Sardar Darya Begi, Bushire). In the past two weeks I have communicated to you several telegrams through the Darya Bogi and others, and I had been awaiting some useful replies from you, to notify the execution of the orders of the Government, as might he expected from one of your good sense and capability. According to information which has reached me based on rumours spread by the^revolutionaries in Pars, the rebel Gendarmes have caused you to favour their side : and since it is quite unsuitable for a personage like yourself, of noble family, to recognize and he of one mind with lawless persons, of unknown descent, who have brought about tumult iu all the State killed innocent people for their own ends, destroyed and ruined the homes of un fortunate men, and looted the property of employes of the Imperial Bank, well disposed towards the country, therefore, according to the commands of His Imperial Majesty I notify you that these proceedings, besides damaging the esteem, in which your services and those of your ancestors and your family and the great Qashqai Tribe are held, will finally lead to the independence of the country being imperilled, and the forces of the foreigners being increased. You must of course, as has been ordered, proceed to Shiraz immediately to the help of Qawam-ul-Mulk with your own forces, seize this band of guilty Gendarmes, disarm them, and free the telegraphs from the censorship.. Then • n m w you should set up His Boyal Highness . Meamng -‘o„ TC r„o,General ,-N. w. k asra t. ug .Sultaneh, Farman Fama* of Pars, in a firm position, and inform me of the results of your services and measures, so that I may be able to submit them to His Imperial Majesty, and you may receive the Imperial favours. Should you act otherwise to what has been ordered by His Imperial Majesty, know that you have gone astray, and have not had in view the preservation of the independence and peace of the country : and in the end you will repent when it is no longer reparable.13 Bear in mind this point that it is impossible for the Persian Government to he able to preserve its independence, if it is at enmity and on bad terms with the Russian and British Governments. Any man who causes them annoyance has imperilled the independence of Persia. One of the services which His Imperial Majesty wishes you to perform ] is the release of these 5 or 6 Englishmen, who have been imprisoned in Dashti and Dashtistan. In conclusion, I remind you again that you should not by any means listen to the rumours and fabrications spread by the revolutionaries. This revolution and these proceedings of theirs have caused the Russian troops to occupy most of the important points : the longer these men continue to act after this sort, the more extensive will become the scope of the interference and operations of the Russian troops : as, for instance, they are now threatening Ispahan, and have despatched troops to Iraq and the neighbourhood of Kirmanshah.

With reference to my telegram No. 39-193 of to-day, I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, copies of communications addressed by Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Khan of Borasjun, Zair Khidhar of Tangistan and Shaikh Hussain Chahkutahi to His Excellency the Governor of the Gulf Ports, in reply to the telegrams sent to them by His Royal Highness the Prime Minister through the Darya Begi. The Ghazanfar’s telegram is so long and argumentative that neither the Darya Begi nor I consider it worth the cost of sending. This individual has been the chief centre of anti-British intrigue for years past hut he is sufficiently cunning not to give himself away too badly. Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain, as will be seen from their letters, show themselves to he irreconcilably hostile to the British Government, and have no hesitation in showing their hostility by deeds and words. I sincerely trust that at the end of the present troubles all these three Khans will he removed from their districts and punished. To have them “ executed in one place ” as suggested by His Excellency the Darya Begi in his telegram to the Prime Minister despatched yesterday, seems the only way of dealing satisfactorily with them, if we desire peace and quiet in these parts.

To His Highness the Prime Minister. Your Highness’ kind telegram has reached me, and I felt proud to receive the fatherly enquiries of Your Royal Highness. But I greatly regret that Your Highness’ telegrams reach me with certain additions, and apparently my telegram reached you greatly mutilated because in my telegram I had made complaints about the oppression v ith which I have been treated, any you have given me no answer to my com plaints.

SSnotdo so, I should be prepared to undergo every kind of punishment P Since I regard obedience to your orders an obligation upon me, I will explain to the people the purport of your exalted commands: but the British themselves, by their bad conduct, cause the purport of your instructions to remain without result. . , „ , As regards your orders that I should assist Qawam-ul-Mulk in the first ulace the forces of the “nation” and the Gendarmerie have brought such sevcre^pressure on Qawam-ul-Mulk, that he could offer no resistance, and left everything he had and went away. At present it is unknown whether he has fled and hidden himself. He has been deserted by all his followers, who have joined the “ nation.” . In the second place, His Excellency the Sardar ’Ashair, who was apparently considered his friend, has now joined hands and made. a convention with the nation and the Gendarmerie according to the following telegrap c proclamation, which I submit: “To Naib Hassan Khan, copies to His Reverence Agha Shaikh Jaffar Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Huzhabr-i-Nizam, Salar Islam, Amir Islam, Aghai Zair Huhammad K.han, iluin-ul-Islam. “ I wTite the following telegram with a heart ^ full ot pleasure.

I, Sultan Ahmed, also on behalf of the. Gendarmerie Department, went through the formalities of swearing an oa . I, Salar Nasrat, also representing the Deputy Governor-Genera , and all the people of Ears gave assurances of full assistance. Immediately His Excellency the Sardar gave orders to co ec 1,500 men, who should proceed to Bushire under the ^ of his noble son, as an advance guard and he himself will to 0 them with a large number of men. We beg to express our con gratulations on this historical day, and at this indestruc i15 and important agreement. Long lives His Excellency Sardar ’Ashair, may Persia long endure. SAL AH N USE AT and AKHGAE {i.e., Sultan Alimad Khan of the Gendarmerie)’*. He is now sending his son with 1,500 men to assist the “ nation ” until the remainder of his forces arrive. Further a copy of his (Soulet’s) telegram to His Imperial Majesty has been sent to me, which I also submit as follows:— “ To His Imperial Majesty the Shah.— “ Ever since the outbreak of the European war, when Your Imperial decree was issued to maintain neutrality, I have been checking public excitement with great difficulty, and I have been using my endeavours in the hills of Behbehan for the first two or three months for the preservation of order. “News has been received stating that the Government have passed a reso lution to embark on hostile operations against the Turkish Govern ment. Although this regrettable news cannot be believed, I humbly beg to represent to Your Imperial Majesty that whoever has moved such a resolution is a traitor, &lt;‘I pray Your Imperial Majesty, ia the name of all the Qashqais and the majority of the people of Ears, not to cause the nation, God forbid, to lose' its love for Your Imperial Majesty. Should such a decision have been taken, I beg, by means of this telegram, to resign my service and responsibility ; and it is impossible for me to oppose a Muhammadan Government.

From— Zair Khidhar Tangistani, To—His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of all the Gulf Ports. I hope you are well and your kindness will not decrease. I have received your letter and I have already sent you an answer through the Qasid, Shahwar Beg. Owing to your remark that we should look after our guests (i.e., British captives) since it would be better for us in future, I have been disturbed a little, and annoyed, so that I have not been able to reply to your letter in the way I should have liked. I ask you one question. Do you consider us fools, or like the traitor and fool of a Minister who states that the liussians have occupied Qum and Ispahan ? Do you not understand well for whom Qum and Ispahan will be, if they are occupied ? Moreover, if we wish to respect our guests, for w r hose sake wdll it be ? If you think it is for the sake of the liar, Mr. Chick, or that of the British Govern ment we are killing thousands of the British soldiers and officers, and regard their great generals as more contemptible than dogs. If we wish to respect them, it will be because of the fact that they are strangers and in distress, and we will respect them to the extreme, in consideration of the fact that they are in our houses and look after the foreign captives. Y ou have also written that you are guarding Bushire and other centres, and asked me for whose sake it was I beg to state that on the day when you left for Bushire, you promised that if the British did not evacuate, you would return. You did not keep your promise at all. You are now watching your opportunity and state that it is for the sake of Islam The man who guards the camp of the British, is not in the least different from themselves* as, for instance, when you remark that we should look after our guests as it will be useful for us in the future. Our present war is with the unbelievers, and our patriotic action is in accordance with the orders of Islam. This war ought to have been waged sixty years ago : why should what happened to-day and yesterday be forgotten that you now try * to inspire us with the hope of the final forgiveness of the unbelievers ? I have sent off the letters to Salar-i-Islam {i.e., Shaikh Hussain) and I will send you his reply when it is received. Sub-enclo. 3, enclo. 18 to Serial No. 140. Dated 9th Habi, I, li&gt;u4* ( = 15th January 1916). From— Shaikh Hussain, Cbahkutahi, To— His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Bushire. I hope you are quite well. I have received Your Excellency’s letter with the copy of the telegram rom the traitorous Minister, as well as a copy of my own letter, which you had sent to the Amir-ul-Islam {i.e., Zair Khidhar). I regret very much that you have not yet got to know us. You have firstly recommended the British prisoners to us, threatening us that we should s l 0 ^ Aa i i we a ble later to come to terms with • I'? iu 16 j 1 * 1 18 1 * j rs ^ P^ ace ) tbe British are most contemptible in our sight than dogs, and w_e shall be the enemies of any one who is friendly with them. Hitherto the British have experienced our friendship ; and now, God willing, they will experience our enmity. . , You hjiTC compkincd tlwt I hiid written very abusively. I have a per- . n ° 0 ! ' a ev ^ r . ^ 'ant; because you have done what you could, and you are holding Bushire for the British. You think that we do not com prehend anything. No : it is not so. tn n.lnfa rV 0 ^ Bu t hiie Bie A n o a U tufangohis would not have been able d t0 Bushire You caused misunderstandings among the people, and made them all one with the unbelievers in the name of your Governorship. Otherwise Angah would not have involved itself in this affair. This is one ongrui y na you have introduced into the world of Islam, and now you17 are trying to exonerate yourself by writing letters, and dividing the people by the telegrams of the traitorous Minister. The people are unanimous and united, and you will repent it and be disgraced, if you take a step without the assent of the “ nation Are you not aware that the power of the Government proceeds from the *’ nation Why do you cast doubt among the people, both higher and common classes ? * You have written that you have become penniless for my sake. When did I give you a document of acceptance for Tul-i-Siah and Chogadak, and not pay the revenue ? The year that you did not receive the revenue of Chahkutah I was not the tenant on your behalf, for you had given the grant of Chahkutah to Shaikh Muhammad. I captured Chahkutah from Shaikh Muhammad at the end of the year with great difficulty. He had already levied the revenue. You claim 500 tumans from me on account of the revenue for Ahmadi, while I had a counter claim against you for 1,500 tumans. Why do you say such things ? You claim to be a statesman. If you were one, and used your brain, you would not have made yourself a servant of Mr. Chick, as a result of which all the people have become your enemies. It would be as well if the affair of the Qawam of Shiraz made you patriotic. You should not involve yourself in pressure from the “ nation ”. If you think that the Tangistanis, Chahkutahis and Dashtis will be annihilated and disappear, it is an impossibility. Mr. Chick and the British Government also will not be able to maintain troops and the fortifications at Bushire People have come to know of the subtleties of the British Government, and they are not less (competent) than Mir Barkat, the Baluch. Now that you have collected tufangchis, you think that you are guarding Bushire by the vigilance of the tufangchis. It is not so. We ourselves are not willing to inflict loss on the people of Bushire. As regards Haji Muhammad Hassan, who is at Halileh, 20 Seyyids and men of Halileh came to my house, and begged me, so that I have now allowed Haji Muhammad Hassan to remain there. Otherwise Haji Muhammad Hassan would not be able to guard Halileh with 25 men. You see for yourself that we make a small attack on Imamzadeh and Subzabad at night, and kill British and Indian troops, and that in a camp where they have over 500 men. If you take my advice, you will give up this idea of yours. Although I know that they will not let you come away openly, you should let me know so that I may send 50 men at night to meet you on your way, and bring you off. It would be better than remaining at Bushire, and subjecting yourself to humi liation. We will take Bushire, God willing. Then you will not be held responsible by the “ nation ”. I have stated this for your information. Although you will say that I am threatening you, yet, God knows, that whatever I say is true, and I am not lying- • 141 Telegram P., No. 18, dated the 7th (received 8th) February 1916.

For some time past financial agent, Kalantar, and others have been worrying the officers of the Residency who live in town at all hours to get money to pay their establishment. It is imperative that Persian Government should take steps to remit money to Bushire Treasury or allow administration to draw on Customs, otherwise it will collapse. I would respectfully point out that if this happens and Governor clears out for lack of funds it will be difficult to replace him especially m these days when there are practically no perquisites.

His surrender has been demanded by the Turks and Vali has advised him to fly. Vali has not actually collected his forces and tribes have gone to their winter quarter, but it would appear from the above that Vali’s general attitude is unsatisfactory.

It is borne out however by news received from Pusht-i-Kuh via Amarah and by receipt at Bushire of copy of inflammatory telegram sent to the hostile Khans of hinterland by Nazim.

Young who is now with Bakhtiari Khans at Malamir and accord- mg to whose present view their attitude is above suspicion telegraphs that they are both very keen to endeavour to effect release of O’Connor and party .p 3, Bakhtiari force. Young enquires whether this idea appeals to me, and if so, desires to know how many persons there are and what we should be prepared to offer as an inducement. ^ ea not seem to me a practicable one even assuming absolute good faith of Bakhtiari Khans. I (doubt ?) if they realised practical aspects of the suggestion or whether prisoners themselves would appreciate experi- '\ r ? m P°Btical point of view unless it was accompanied by responsi- sible political officers known in the localities traversed it would be against out interests to have a Bakhtiari force moving through Lirawi Hayat Dawood.

I am extremely doubtful that he would have given us sufficient proofs of his British partisan ship this month and I was preparing for change of Governors but results might have been satisfactory as we have been pressing him hard. Haig’s information seems all to come either Irom Russian officers, uho have not the same knowledge of Kainat as British Vice-Consul and myself, or from the partisans of Hisam ud (Daula ?). Colonel Haig communicated to me recently as a serious item report furnished by acquaintance of Hisam that Governor had released Ali Akhar the spy and had given him 200 tomans but this has proved quite untrue. I persistently icpresented last summer that Imad-ud-JVlulk was openly assisting the Germans in Tabbas and should be punished. The Russians on the contrary 'made him Governor. X hear to-day that in Tabbas there are 400 German sowars. Before interfering with Kainat I think that Russians in Khorasan might set their own houses in order. I am, I think, entitled to protest, with all respect, against His Britannic Majesty’s Minister’s sudden decision before I had time to submit my opinion on the telegram from Meshed. I consider the proposal to arrest Shaukat is most ill-advised. It would set the whole population against us and from the point of view of the Germans, who only seem to wish to enter Afghanistan, it would create a most opportune diversion. Shaukat is neither an idiot nor a fanatic. It has been his one desire to establish a reputation for impartiality. He knows better than to undertake active hostilities against Russia and India. I have just heard that Hisam has married Governor-General of Khorasan’s niece. The Governor-General’s opposition to Hisam’s appointment at Gunabad may have been a trick merely. 101 Telegram P., No. 11-F., dated the 27th (received 29th) January 1916. From Major F. B. Prioeaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. ^ Seiler despatched three letters from Dehsalm to Neh (1) to our Hazaras (2) to Deputy Governor, (3) to people of Neh, The last on the list w^as signed by a Sayyid. The first was brought to Mr. Do veil, Telegraph clerk, immediately by Deputy Governor and Persian telegraph master. To-day second and third have been given to him. Their tone pio\es clearly that there is no collusion between Germans and Deputy oyernor and we cannot (?) Shaukat. In his letter to Deputy Governor Seiler refers to bombardment of Meshed Mosque. All three letters beg for assistance against British. Though only thirty rifles remained with Lovell at Neh when our troops moved west none met with any response. This furnished better proof than any bazar gossip which goes to Turbat-i- Haidari, Meshed and Askabad (of) neutrality of Kainat officials. 102 Telegram P., No. 12-F., dated the 28th (received 29th) January 1916.

When they fled I lost rest of party and had to return and surrender myself. Our second party contains 8 Germans, 28 Austrians and, not counting ] ■ camel men, 150 Persians and Indians. Seiler sent water back for them together with instructions for them. I do not know where they will appear next. One month ago ? Wagner got through to Herat with two mountain guns ' * and twenty mule loads. He travelled south of Birjand. Amir of Afghanistan is friendly to us. Governor, Birjand, has no arrangement with us. Zug- mayer’s party will attack Koh-hMalik Siah and not go to Afghanistan. Ends. Winckelmann showed us on January 22nd where he had hidden his rifle, two maps, two note books and other papers including simple cypher code. Present object of Germans is it appears to get into Afghanistan. Our forces, without ? news from west of Lut, cannot prevent small parties breaking through. We cannot distribute our parties at more than four places safely and Germans consequently can travel almost safely via Sarbisha or Sahlabad or Girdi or Aliabad. Though I hope we have nearly surmounted difficulties about rationing our present strength question of supplies makes it difficult for reinforcements to be sent from India. The solution seems to be to send four more mountain guns at least and numerous machine guns w T hich would make small detachments much stronger than is possible at present. Our position in Eastern Persia will become precarious I believe if more Germans enter Afghanistan as they can raise volunteers and attack us from the east much more easily. Unless we have plenty of guns our Baluch levies may even become source of anxiety. 104 Telegram P., No. 281-D. S., dated the 29th January 1916.

Translation of a letter dated 2oth Sofar 1334 (=2nd January 1916), from a certain Mirza Mahmud Khan, a “ Democrat, ” Shiraz, to uigha Mirza Ahmad Khan, a “ Democrat ” of Shiraz, recently appointed Persian Post- master, Bunder Abbas. I have received your post card which you wrote to me from Kazarun. You had then heard of the fighting which we had expected, and had asked me to report the details to you.11 You had of course witnessed up to Sunday, when you were still here the refusal of the Qawam-ul-Mulk to comply with the articles set forth in the agreement. You are well aware also that the Zia-ul-Wa’izin declared in the course of his speech on Friday that “ we ask for a respite from the ^ Gendarmerie up to Monday in that perhaps an amicable arrangement may be reached. Well on Monday morning the 12th (20th December) when the period of the respite expired, the officers, who used to attend the “ national ” drill every day, did not appear. No one also knew what they were going to do. About three hours after sunrise civil war began, and guns and rifles were fired, i'he Madrasah-i-Khan was the centre of fighting, and the positions held by the Gendarmerie were duly maintained. All shops were closed at once. From Monday morning up to Thursday evening, the 15th (23rd Decem ber 1915) 150 shells were fired at the Qawam’s sangars, some of which were destroyed and some damaged. Among the other strong positions held by the Arabs, one was the mosque of the late Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk, which could not in any way be captured by the Gendarmerie during these 11 days of fighting, because they (the Arabs) had barricaded two doors with stones and were fighting only from one door. The point opposing this sangar was the house of Haji Abbas Ali Attar, from which place guns were fired. Yet notwithstanding the fact that some 50 shells and 200 r bombs were thrown at the wall of the mosque, no damage was effected. As soon as the Gendarmes occupied a house and made an advance, the “ Arabs ” and heads of the ruffians of Shiraz and others, joined by the forces of the Qawam himself immediately set the house on fire, and forced the Gendarmes back two houses. You were of course well aware that the number of the Gendarmes at Shiraz was not sufficient. They were under the impression that they would be able to succeed with this small number, but they found out finally that they would be defeated under such circumstances. They started sending for the Gendarmes on the Bushire road and the Abadeh road and a sufficient number arrived at the end of the fighting. Tufangchis arrived from Kumanp Borasjun, Daliki and other places; and even a few Turks came, and the Gendarmes’ positions were strengthened. During these 11 days of fighting more than 40 Ge f Ff 50 wounded, amongst whom were Naib Ah Reza Khan and I Masoud Khan, the Assistant Chief of Police. But, thank God, they perfectly recovered by now, and are able to walk about. About 55 innocent men, Sayyids and Akhunds, 12 -year- 0 ld g Clnldren and women around there were shot from the ower on ' v? ^ u Muzaraee’s house, which was one of the strong positions of Qawam s party, appears that the Rayat tribesmen were occupying the place. 1 cannot adequately describe to you how the Arab and Bayat and men of the Qawam’s districts were abusing the emo ^ ^ t] ^ k y that th i s fighting nights that fighting was goin 0 on. 1 7 Vp-, abused as much as they &lt; *. fa i»‘.£ .■—« -fc'*™ *'■* » the house of Sayyid Ja’far Mazaraee.

I feel inclined to state some things here, hut fear that you may suspect me But God is witness that I do not say this myself, but it is suggested to me when I see that the Gendarmes have acted contrary to their promises, although they issued reassuring notices, stating that the Department had no hostileintentions against any one. They had caused the people to dislike them and the common people hate them and say that they emoyed peace s g as the Qawam was there, and that any town must at any rate ace a Governor. I cannot tell you one thousandth part of what I want to say, how ever disposed I may he to describe the affair. I will only say that the members 1 of the Democrat party are hated and cursed by both parties to such an extent that there is no limit to it. The members of the Gendarmerie Department do nothing hut talk evilly of the party, while the persons who have been looted, and whose houses have been burned, and who consider that the Democrat party are responsible for the affair, also curse I lie latter It has become very had for the party meanwhile. No one can hold the Gendarmes in check. They meved to their Department whatever of the Qawam’s belongings and furniture they could, which were of light weight and great value. They will be auctioning in the Police Department such items of the articles as are or no use to them. There have been no casualties among the military men, except the one which I have already stated to you. No meetings of the Militia, Democrats or inspecting parties are being held. They have all been suspended and are not supposed to he held for some time to come. Finally, this is the internal state of affairs in Shiraz.

You should therefore be ready with all your forces, and co-operate with the Qawam-ul-Mulk. You will thereby cause the confidence and dependence of the Government on you to increase. You should report the result. My object is that on the receipt of this telegram you should start at once with all your forces, and proceed to Shiraz, and you should not fail to afford every assistance to Qawam-ul-Mulk. You should also notify all the people that the Swedish officers have all been dismissed and removed from their offices, and that if the Persian officers and men obey the Swedes after the noti fication of this order they should be disarmed. But if they obey and submit to the orders of the Government, they will be retained in their posts, and kind ness will be shown to them, and they will be the children of this country.

Briefly speaking His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk could not make a stand, and preferred to leave rather than stay there. All his premises are under the seal of the Gendarmerie Department. Also 300 Gendarmes with full equipment have left in his pursuit. The situation at Shiraz is exceedingly calm. His Excellency the Nasir-ul-Mulk is the Deputy Governor-General. The Ilkhaniship of the Khamseh and Arab tribes has been entrusted to His Excellency Amir Agha Khan, Mansur-us- Sultaneh, Haji Amir-ul-Mulk has been placed in charge of the Police Depart ment.

He will return victorious to this place in the next two days. According to the letter he has written to me, he has sent for troops from all places to collect in the camp at hamur, so that, on his own arrival at fCazerun, he may proceed without opposition to take action for his nation.

(Through His Excellency Darya Begi, Bushire.) I have received your telegram by the English line and I am very glad that you have received my telegram, and that you have learnt the policy and intentions of the Government. I now again write, in view of the feelings of kindness which I have entertained from old time towards your late father, Mirza Hussain Khan, and you yourself, to say that I imagined that my first telegram would make you acquainted with the delicate state of affairs, and that 5 there would be no need for explanation and repetition. But seeing that the reply you sent me was very dry and formal, I therefore would point out to vou and remind you that all these proceedings and demonstrations which you have seen and heard are nothing but mere words; and are absolutely contrary to the interests of the country. They have been in fact the outcome of the instigations of mischief-makers and the money and pounds which they have received from certain quarters. This has made them blind, and they have traitorously caused this land to be involved in a thousand misfortunes. Thev have not in the least understood that it was only m consequence of these stupid proceedings that they have caused foreign troops to enter this country, an cl that the latter have now advanced as far as Ispahan and Kirmanshah unfortunately. You should realize this point and make it known to all that the Govern- merit’s relations with the neighbouring Powers are c0 ^ ia , 1 ; and friendlv and that whoever has acted contrary to this attitude and in tentio” and spread rumours, has manufactured lies and has in fact acted the part of a traitor towards this Government and country.

I do not expect further to receive mere formal telegrams from you ; I 4 expect vou to send sincere telegrams, and take serious action in these matters. In anything you do contrary to this you will make a mistake and be in the wrong. Enclo. No. 12 to Serial No. 111. Telegram No. 3698, dated the 19th Jady( = Sth January 1916) ► From— Hts Royal Highness Farman Farma, Prime Minister, Tehran, To—S oulet-ud-Dolleh, Sardar ’Ashair, Shiraz. Although I sent you telegrams four days ago by the Persian and British lines and informed you of the object and views of the Government, and pointed out to you your duty, I have now again to state in order to emphasise the point more, that according to information received by me certain men of the Gendarmerie Department, and the evilly-disposed classes of the people have mutinously and rebelliously taken steps against His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk, and have created all sorts of difficulties. Now a number of them have met in the Telegraph Office, and are suggesting such matters as they desire, and publishing and manufacturing news that they please. They have published a telegram alleged to have been received from His Eoyal Highness Nusrat-us-Sultaneh in accordance with their own wishes. I write therefore to make you clearly understand your duty. All the rumours spread by them in the name of His Royal Highness or that of the Government are manufactured, and baseless lies, and have not a vestige of truth in them. Persons spreading such rumours whether of the Gendarmerie officers or the people, are all rebels and guilty in the eyes of the Government, and are dismissed from the service of the Government, and should be all thoroughly punished, and disarmed. His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk is the Deputy Governor-General of Ears and the representative of the Government, and should be the object of every solicitude and kindness. Your duty is that you should co-operate and help him, wherever he is, with your forces, and in particular, that you should take your men, and obtain assistance from everywhere and every one, and coavey Qawam-ul-Mulk to Shiraz with all respect, and enable him to take charge of his duty as the Deputy Governor-General. Persons who have committed this unwarrantable act against him whether of the Gendarmerie or other classes, should be all arrested and severely punished, and disarmed: and you should put the authority of the Qawam on a firm footing in all villages. You should not accept any other telegram than this, which I am sending you by the Company’s (British) line through His Excellency Darya Begi, because the Telegraph Office is in the hands of the other party, who publish and spread any report they please. You should take immediate action, as I have written, and not hesitate about it. At present 30,00“ Russian troops have come over to this country as a result of such suicidal actions, so destructive to the stale on the part of these men who have received very large sums of money from foreigners, and fallen victims to tneir instigations They (foreign troops) have advanced to near Ispahan and Kirmanshah. God forbid, let it not happen that they should be compelled to advance as far as Ears, Then your endeavours will be nullified and the prestige of your family, and that of others will be shaken to the foundations and it will be difficult for the Government to hold them in check. In view of the feelings of kindness which I entertain towards you I particularly write to acquaint you with the fact that all the actions of these men are unlawful, and contrary to the object of the Government and interests of the country. You should abide by the instructions sent by me, and report the result at an early date.17 Enclo. No. 13 to Serial No. 111. Telegram R., No. 19-94, dated the 12th January 1916.

Eirst is from nephew of Darya Begi to Darya Begi reporting how before » fighting began the “ Committee ” offered terms for an amicable settlement to Qawam but latter refused them. Gendarmerie and troops joined in attacking Qawam. They published what purported to be a telegram from Governor-General dispossessing Qawam of all his property. Telegrams were also received and published from Ulema of Ispahan and from Shaikh Husain and Zair Khidhar. Writer adds that chief cause of fighting was the capture of the British which was effected without Qawam’s knowledge. Writer seems to have “ democratic ” views, but letter shows Qawam in good light. Second letter from a “democrat” to the new democratic Postmaster at Bunder Abbas has been intercepted by Censor. He says in effect that the names of “ democrats ” and gendarmes stink in the nostrils of the people of Shiraz who are heartily sick of tbe whole business and long to have orderly rule again; they blame and curse gendarmerie as the cause of all their troubles.

But the Qawam-ul-Mulk did not agree to any of the conditions, and 7 days passed without any action being taken by him to assist the people. As a matter of fact, on the contrary, he increased his forces every ' A fresh proclamation signed by the Committee for the Defence of Persia was published, stating that if no satisfactory and convincing answer were fm+henmim? from the Qawam-ul-Mulk, that Committee would proceed to carry out its duties „ The Zia-ul-Waezin and Zia-ul-Udaba, the Editor of the “ Jam-i-J am, were deputed again by the Provincial Committee to use their influence in any way they could with a view to preventing matters taking a more serious shape. They also published in detail the result of the measures and trouble taken by them, and published them for the information of the public. But, unfortunately, this time also they received from the Qawam-ul-Mulk a reply which caused them to despair. On the same day a broadsheet was printed and pubiisnea detailing the treasons of the Qawam-ul-Mulk, and warlike operations com menced on the 12th instant (20th December 1915). The roar of the guns and rifles was, and is, filling the air. Fighting began on both sides. The Army Department had made a secret pre-arrangement with the Gendarmerie, of which only few officers were aware. On that day men and guns were removed to the Gendarmerie Departmen , and they jointly and unanimously started fighting. Up to now 4 men of t e Military Department have been wounded and 10 or 15 men of the Gen darmes. But the enemy have had many casualties in killed and wounded. Victory has so far been with the Gendarmerie, and the Military. The ex penses of the forces are paid by the Gendarmerie. They have occupied the Nasir-ul-Mulk’s mosque, which is near the Qawam’s house, and it is hkely tha they will occupy the house of Qawam himself in a few days. But I do not think that fighting will come to an end so soon. A telegram has been received from His Royal Highness Prince Nusrat- us-Sultaneh stating that the Qawam has been dispossessed of all his properties which have been given into the charge of Mansur-us-Sultaneh Arab. Another telegram has been received from the Ulama of Ispahan, express ing their readiness to co-operate with the people of Pars, and also telegrams from Zair Khidhar, and Shaikh Hussain Khan. These telegrams have been printed and published.19 The administration of the town has been entrusted to Nasir-ul-Mulk for the present. I think they will return Haji Amir-ul-Mulk in charge of the Police Department. For the present fighting is going on with great severity. The military have made a heavy attack on the other party’s positions, and the latter have vacated most of their sangars and run away. The original and chief reason for this affair was the incident of the 2nd Muharram, in connection with the capture of the British, which was effected without the knowledge of the Qawam. They have summoned the officials of Jahrum, Lar and Mamasani, I will state my personal opinion in my next letters, or when I see Your Excellency. * * * * Turkish Consul arrived at Shiraz some time ago. 112 Telegram P., No. 36211, dated the 26th January 1916.

I venture in that case to submit a few suggestions on the probable results. Preservation of order in Bussian sphere of influence will be sufficiently ensured by enlarged brigade (for maintenance of which Russia in our impend ing conversations with the Persian Government is sure to stipulate) and even if there is money enough forthcoming to maintain it gendarmerie will have no raison d'etre.3 order 1 Ud T Tv.^vfu - 110 ^ 01 '- 06 com P eten t to restore and maintain sendin^? d tmn^ fn ly ti t lmk IIlS ^ ia J est y ’ 8 Government will be disposed to MaWNvin P i t l6 IT' 1 ! 08 ®, of J 01nln g ? gendarmes now in ? under Major In ystron and supposed to be loyal.

Meanwhile unless Government of India is able to send some force to act as a nucleus and (.) additional officers to train new corps which could perhaps be recruited among Kawam tribesmen, condition of Pars and other districts along littoral will, I fear, go from bad to worse. Kawam, as you are aware, has failed to crush gendarmerie largely owin® to failure of Soulet to give him assistance.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; repeated India, Petrograd, Basrah.) Persian Prime Minister has just sent his son to say that he wishes to know if His Majesty’s Government really desire in principle to conclude alliance4 before presenting bis proposals for a basis of discussion of such alliance. Subject had been much discussed in political circles and His Highness, if . pro posal was not agreeable to two Powers in the interests of his own position, rather than run risk of seeing negotiations once commenced break dpwn owing to indifference two Powers, would find his own pretext for not carrying matters any further. Nosret-ed-Dowleh in answer to my enquiry said proposal was for a defen sive alliance for protecting interest of three Powers in Persian territory. I pointed out that His Majesty’s Government might desire alliance, but find price required by Persia (too high ?) and that practical thing was for him confidentially to let me know the proposed terms. Nosret-ed-l)owleh gave the following outline on my undertaking to represent I had obtained my knowledge by private means. Persia would engage to place all her resources, material and moral, and regular and irregular forces at disposal of two Powers for defence of their interests within Persian territory and in return ask our assistance to finance and equip force of 50,000 (this includes 10,000 men of Cossack Brigade), cancellation of Persian debt and a monthly subsidy of 500,000 tomans and in addition Persia wished for assurances that such questions as revision of tariff, withdrawal of Russian troops, revision of treaty of Turcomanshai tenure of land by foreigners would be dealt with in a friendly spirit at the end of the war. Parma Parma according to Nosret-ed-Dowleh admitted that these proposals were practically those put forward by the late Prime Minister, but though they quite expected to have to abate their pretensions Government could not ask for less. I told Nosret-ed-Dowleh I felt sure Petrograd would not listen to can cellation of whole debt and I feared that monthly subventions, which he said came in all to about one million two hundred and fifty thousand tomans, would be considered excessive. He replied Parma Parma considered it as matter of bargaining and if both parties wished to reach an arrangement, one capable of adjustment. He added that to talk of Persia’s resources sounded ridiculous of course, but Prime Minister was confident that he could mobilize all western tribes against Turks provided alliance was concluded. Result would be of unques tionable value merely if it saved Russian troops from constant harrying if Parma Parma can make good this assurance. I think that alliance is worth having apart from this. Presuming that list given by Nosret-ed-Dowleh of questions to be discussed after war is complete, Russia, which is chiefly concerned by them to judge from rather vague comments of Russian Minister, is not likely to raise any serious objections, and I do not think that we need do so. Prom a Persian point of view other deziderata are questions of money. I do not think Government hope seriously for cancellation of debt while they seem to be ready to cut down subvention. Even if it is not reduced a year’s subvention is less than cost to us alone of a single day’s war. Value to us of alliance is that German hope of Islamic Union is killed, while locally we put end to JPersian{?) neutrality which means in Persian eyes allowing enemy to do what he likes and substituting for it positive duty of taking action against that enemy. 42 Telegram No. 38-F., dated the Uth (received 15th) January 1916.

From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Sent to Tehran ; repeated Foreign, Basrah.) Situation in Ears. There seems to be general consensus of opinion, now thatKawam has been compelled to leave Shiraz ?, that fairly strong force of Gendarmerie and democrat levies will be sent into Bushire hinterland ?, one portion to attack Shabankara and possibly Hayat Baud and the remainder to reinforce Khans outside Busbire itself. Ismail ? and Haidar Khan and Khan of Jngali ? have each separately sent word to this effect and in fact it seems obvious thing for rebels to do if Kawam has retired far from Shiraz. If the Gendarmerie come Dastisak (Daliki?) in force they will be joined there by all hostile elements,and Soulet,from whom we can expect nothing would, according to Governor, permit itashgai to join them on march in small parties. Gendarmerie and democrats in Shiraz will embark on such an enterprise the more readily as they hold Indian troops in very low epteem chiefly owing to outrageous lies published there regarding Sheikh Hussein’s successes. Situation here will he considerably changed for worse should this move take place whether Gendarmerie start by attacking friendly Khans or move direct on Bushire. I have informed Military authorities so that they may be prepared as to get early information when the Gendarmerie start will be difficult. It seems necessary in the circumstancss to help Kawam as much as we can and as quickly as possible as activity on his part is the only thing like y to prevent the move in this direction. 44 Telegram R., No. 124-, dated the 14th (received 15th) January 1916.

Eollowing is purport of telegrams w hich have recently passed :— Demeanour of Khans in Tehran has been very satisfactory lately and Minister contemplated no difficulty in getting them to countersign any agreement arrived at between us and Khans here. Meeting of Grahame and Young with them for this purpose was on the point of taking place at the Oil-fields, and after discussion details with us Minister w r as about to telegraph text of final draft when Grahame wdred January 13th, that Khans now announced their intention of proceeding first to Behbehan and thus not reching Oil-fields till March 21st. They explained that their immediate presence at Behbehan had been rendered necessary first by attitude of Soulet w r ho was interfering in Kuhgalu territory and by the arrival of a fanatic mulatto Seyed ? Esa who was endeavouring to excite inhabitants to Jihad, Before starting, however, they asked Doctor Young to visit them professionally at Malamir. He is on the way there and will endeavour to remain in their company. Minister to-day expressed some suspicion of their sudden change of plans and asked Grahame if it was not possible that they had been bought over by Germans. All things are possible, but I have expressed view that Bakhtiaris are unlikely to enter into hostile collusion with Soulet, or to abandon friendly negotiations with us if their homes at and near Ispahan are soon to be at the mercy of Russian force. We shall know better what their intentions are when Young reaches them. 48 Telegram P., No. 10, dated (and received) the 16th Jannary 1916.

Eeference Bushire telegrams 58 and 123. Situation is very confused at moment but past experience of Soulet’s I indecisive character makes it unlikely that he will show open or active hostility towards us. It is evident, however, that we can expect no co-operation from him. i I belie re that occupation of Ispahan by Eussians would remove Bakhtiari question finally from sphere of anxiety and would probably have a sobering effect on situation in Ears but Jamshedi ? might stimulate Gendarmerie and hostile element to a {forty thousand) combined ? effort against Bushire. In any case, however, there seems to be no immediate possibility of Eussians reach ing Ispahan so we must exclude contingency from present calculations. As regards Kawam Minister states to-day that he is now at Lar and will proceed to Bunder Abbas in order to get in touch with Tehran. Trevor was not aware of this when he sent his telegram No. 123. It is therefore clear that Kawam can he of no present help to us in connection with situation near Bushire. On the other hand if present unsatisfactory situation is prolonged he may, if assisted by us wdth money and munitions of war in consultation with Central Government, be able to recover Shiraz for latter in Spring. I suggest his son-in-law now at Bunder Abbas should be directed to fetch him speedily to Bunder Abbas where plans can be satisfactorily discussed. As regards Bushire hinterland I agree with Trevor that Gendarmerie and hostile Khans wiU now in all probability turn their attention to Bunder Big and Bushire direction. As regards Bunder Eig I think we should keep Khans spirits up by keeping a man-of-war in evidence there and maintaining close touch with them. As regards Busliire, position now requires vigilant watching and possibility of having to strengthen garrison must be contempla ted. General Staff here are going into question of Turkish captured weapons but I fear very little is available as it is required ? elsewhere.

Dated 29th November 1915 .—The enemy are fleeing in terror, we are pursuing them day and night. To-day we occupied Aziziyeh and advanced as far as Reshavi. The night raid attempted by the English with motor cars was defeated. Last night we destroyed an armoured motor car, captured one iron barge and an armoured boat but the English had destroyed the con tents. In the English camp at Aziziyeh we found much material abandoned by the enemy. Among the officers’ effects we discovered valuable political documents. The English published a notice intended to deceive the inhabitants of the villages through which they fled to the effect that an armistice had been arranged with the Turks. Our latest information is that the English casualties exceeded 5,000, including a great number of officers.9 Bated 30th November 1915. —To-day we forced the enemy to fight, our casualties were only about 100 killed and 100 wounded.

Bloss) containing 17 guns, the latter will be fit for service after repairs have been effected, it has been sent to Baghdad for repair and re-named “ Salman Pak ”. The English made a stand between Kut and Bafileh, they fired 120 shells but little damage resulted.

We captured much material including a wireless installation with the officer in charge of it and five aeroplanes. The English Cavalry Commandant was killed and the Commander-in-Chief has gone to Basrah. “ The venerable priest Haji Ali Agha had donned a soldier’s uniform and drills with the Nationalist recruits in the drill hall which has been established in the Masjed-i-No.” A telegram to the Shah states that the people of Shiraz have heard with indignation that he has made a compact with the English and Bussians and intends to act contrary to the interests of his subjects and his fellow-religionists the Turks.

(Addressed to Tehran and repeated to Foreign Department, Delhi, and Basrah.) Pars situation. Nizam has received letter from Kawam and yesterday resuscitated latter’s complaint to His Majesty’s Representative, Bunder Abbas. It appears Kawam is exercised by failure of Persian Government to reply to his telegrams for past month and to indicate to him clearly their policy in Pars. He asks firstly that he should receive clear information from Persian Government of their policy and whether they are working in accord with British and Russian Governments. Secondly whether the Persian British Governments intend to assist him and to what extent: this is necessary to enable him to shape his own lines of action. Vice-Consul assured Nizam that our Governments are in complete accord but latter said that absence ol instructions to this effect from Persian Government was suspicious and that mild and polite tone of the Prime Minister’s telegram to Mansur gave colour to idea that all was not well. Nizam urged that necessity for royal proclamation re-affirming that Kawam is Deputy Governor-General of Pars and directing him to suppress rebellion, etc , as a counter blast to recent forged proclamation published by rebels that Kawam had been dismissed. He a 1 su laid stress on necessity for promptitude in giving assistance as delay would make operations more difficult and result in more defections to the enemy.

If we can arrange for ship be will be glad to come at once to Bushire. In consultation with the Commodore I can probably do this. Perhaps Cox could arrange to meet him here and bring down available Turkish ammunition and arms. As tribesmen use 7 mm. and Gendarmerie 8 mm. Mauser rifles, if we give Kawam chiefly .303 (be states now that be has five hundred *303 rifles and requires 100,000 rounds) and Martini ammunition it would not be so much use to enemy in unlikely event of its falling into their hands. If any old pattern of *450 machine guns available Kawam would find them useful. 65 Telegram No. 54-F., dated the 21st (received 22nd) January 1916.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, rp 0 rp}j e Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart-* ment, Delhi, (Addressed Minister, Tehran.) Question has arisen here of the expediency of closing the Ispahan route to imports wholly or partly. Position being that Shiraz road is practically closed and Russians are operative from across Kermanshah-Ispahan route.Lynch’s road thus remains the sole source of supply for enemy forces in Ispahan. Were the Russian likely to reach Ispahan in very short time the measure might not be worth while, but as I understand that contrary is the case it would seem in our interests to close this channel of supply and Russians would probably welcome measure. We should no doubt need to compensate Bakhtiaris for whole or portion of tolls at present received by them from Ahwaz road. The amount involved monthly will he ascertainable from statistics of traffic. Would you consider general question in consultation with Russian authorities as you may think necessary. It is no use to discuss details until we are agreed on general question as to whether some action in this direction is desirable. 69 Telegram R., No. 193, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) January 1916.

Birst to have written exceedingly truculent letters to Governor saying he has broken his promise to them (that P) when he came to Bushire that he would rejoin them if the English did not evacuate the place, and (had ?) be come an infidel and no better than the English whom they consider “ more con temptible than dogs ”. They refer to Prime Minister as a traitor and fool and say they will continue fighting till English are turned out of Bushire. Khan of Borasjun has sent a long argumentative draft telegram to Prime Minister in which he says he has received Prime Minister’s telegram with additions and Prime Minister must have received his telegram very mutilated as His Royal Highness has not answered the points raised. Khan declares Soulet and Deputy Governor, Kazerun, have taken oath on koran to join nation and former is sending 1,500 men under his son to attack Bushire. This is advance guard and Soulet will come himself later with large force. Incidentally he quotes in extenso the alleged telegram from Soulet to Shah referred to in my telegram 15-63 and another telegram pur porting to have been sent by Deputy Governor, Kazerun, and Sultan Ahmad gendermerie officer there to Committee and all pro-German newspapers report* ing Soulet’s adherence to cause of nation.

Also a few additional oftcers should be sent thither to recruit among Kawam’s people force of which as soon as he can arrive Sykes would take charge. He asks mission and guns be sent if troops cannot be sent. Kawam is expected to arrive Feb ruary 7th Bunder Abbas. He is apprehensive lest now that Soulet-ud-Daula must be accepted as? having joined enemy Kawam may be crushed unless effective support is at once given to him. If he should be crushed task of restoring Government control in Pars will be rendered far more difficult than it is already. Prime Minister has received report that Government of India has decided to send a small force to Kerman. He thinks Governor, Kerman, who is now aware of change of attitude of Persian Government and is showing himself loyal would be able to suppress German movements if this were done. He strongly deprecates any attempts unless supported by very strong force to undertake ? action even recruiting from Bushire.

According to a letter intercepted Afghans (?) ? in Askabad, he helped party under Niedermeyer into Afghanistan, he has received from Germans large sums of money and with his empty professions of friendship he is merely deceiving us. This same letter refers to his relations with Afghan Government and superior officers of Afghanistan and to his having bought an estate there and a house at Kabul also This information is corroborated by other infor mation received by the Russians who learn also that he is still acting as abe ^ ween the Germans iQ Afghanistan and those in 1 ersia, that he has sent recently couriers to Herat twice and once to Kerman any that he employs others disguised as Darweshes besides these regular couriers s US ® 0rr ° ,l0rat ; d and amplifies that given in Sistan diaries JNos. 46 and 47 of 1915 and other information which I have received.

Brita ? nio Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, has been provided with three copies. 1 KEPLIES Oh V&gt; INCKELMANN TO QUESTIONS OF THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF. : oiio«i° n S an d (If).— They are divided up into expeditions as 1st Expedition. Berr Seiler, Consul of Ispahan. Was sent from Constantinople, where lie was dragoman of the German Consulate there, to be Consul at Basrah. As tins place was in British hands before his arrival he was sent as Consul to Ispahan. There he was relieved by Herr von Kardorff, who had been at the Embassy at Tehran. On being relieved Seiler went upon this expedition the object of which was to get into Afghanistan. He made all the arrano-e- ments for the journey. Major von Versen was at Khabis when Winckelmann left there. He used to be in the 1 st Guards Begiment of Foot, and retired before the war. On the outbreak of w r ar he received the command of a battalion in a Hamburg Hegiment. Von Versen was the leader of the military operations. Doctor Niedermayer is a brother of Lieutenant Niedermayer, who has given his name to this expedition. He was its doctor and is a civilian. Lieute nant Niedermayer is already in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Waldmann belongs to a Bavarian infantry regiment. Before the war he was a merchant in Ispahan and agent for the Hoechst Colour AVorks. When war broke out he returned to Germany and,spent some time on the Western front fighting. From there he was ordered to Baghdad as liaison officer. Having become supernumerary there he was taken over by Niedermayer. Voss was a merchant in Tabriz. Is now cashier of the expedition. Fasting joined the expedition in Baghdad as telegraphist. He was sent out from Germany, but Winckelmann does not know under whose orders. He has no military position in the expedition. Frederick was a private in Winckelmann’s Begiment, the 4th Guards Artillery, and is now armourer to the expedition. He has been wfith WinckeL mann since he left Berlin. Doctor Czuturas is a Hungarian and has been serving in that capacity (doctor) during the war with the Austrian Army. He joined the expedition at Ispahan under orders from Tehran as a doctor. There are no Austrian officers with the expedition, hut there were at Khabis some 35 Austrian soldiers Wore were expected, but how many Winckelmann does not know. A fairly large convoy was on its way from Tehran. All the above-mentioned persons were at Khabis when Winckelmann left there. lleoeivad on 13 AfhljQluwBh INDIA FOREIG ^ETARY’S Letter- To. 22 M Dated j !-*2nd Expedition. - r assmuss at Shiraz and joined Zugmeyer at Kerman. He has no military 3 Slt j 2 hrr TVedig is a non-commissioned officer, regiment unknown. Was servant of Prince Reuss at Tehran, and attached to the expedition by the a serv; latter. The above are all Germans. . , t • xt. t.-, . Doctor Biach is an Austrian and a savant interested m the history of culture. Is liable to military service, but when war broke out he was. travel ling in Sistan and thereabouts and unable to get home. He therefore joined the • Zugmeyer expedition at Kermsn. He is the cashier of the expedition and a 1 non-commissioned officer belonging to the reserve. At the beginning of January 1916 the above were all the Europeans with this expedition at Kerman, but Bohnstorff had gone to Yazd to meet a fairly large reinforcement of Austrians^ ^numbers unknowm. In addition to these Europeans there were a number of native Levies, consisting of Persians, Afghans, Indians (mainly Baluchis). Winckelmann one day saw 150 paid and more were expected. These men were all armed. 3rd Expedition. Consul was Consul in Bushire before the war. Was in Ger-- many on leave and was sent out with Winckelmann and others as leader of the expedition into Afghanistan. He made himself unpopular and at Aleppo was deposed. He was then given a separate command and Winckelmann believes his locus operandi was Shiraz. With him w r as Herr Bohnstorff mentioned above and Doctor Lenders. He was the railway doctor at Baghdad. Winckelmann has had letters from him but has not met him. He had left Baghdad before he arrived. With the exception of the above information Winckelmann knows nothing of this expedition. 4th Expedition. This consists of a large number of German officers who entered the Turkish Army and were operating at Basrah and Nasiriyah with the lurkish forces. After the ba+tle of Nasiriyah they senarated from the Turkish forces and went back to Baghdad. After Winckelmann had left the latter place he heart that this expedition had gone down to the Karun river and he believes them still to be there. This expedition consists of at least twenty German officers and a large number of German civilians. All of these civilians had become Turkish officers. Their numbers are unknown. On proceeding to the Karun river they left Turkish service All their names were published in the3 of German officers that He returned to Germany 5th Expedition. Consul Schunemann was formerly Vice-Consul in Tabriz and Director of the Persische Teppich Aktien Gesellschaft in Tabriz. He went to Germany to volunteer for the war, his place at Tabriz being taken by Consul Litten, who belongs to the German Consular Service. Schunemann was returned from Germany and sent as Consul to Kerman- shah. There he organized an expedition to go into the province of Azerbaijan, his place at Kermanshah being taken by Consul Professor Doctor Saare. Winckelmann met Saare at Kermanshah. The expedition started after he had left. There were a large number of officers with it but he does not know their names. It was this expedition that met the Prussians at Kangavar and Hamadan. Other names of Germans in Persia not hitherto mentioned are:— Prince Henry XXXI of Eeuss, the younger line. Ambassador at Tehran. Count Kanitz, Military Attache. Herr Sommer, Secretary to the Embassy. Herr Sandherr, employed at the Embassy. Herr von Wustrow, Consul at Shiraz, Doctor Illberg, Embassy Doctor. Doctor Pecker, possibly at Kerman. Herr Tiewenov, Engineer of the Baghdad Eailway, probably with Schune mann. These are all the names that Winckelman can recollect. Question (£)•—Winckelmann sawtwo Indians at the Consulate at Kerman, and one w as with his expedition who he tfiinks was a Hindu but he wore Persian dress. He does not know the names of any. Has heard that large numbers had joined the various expeditions. They consisted of captured soldiers who had been released, and of civilians probably from Switzerland. He believes they w 7 ere travelling under false names. They used to come to the Consulates and ask for, money for expenses, and were not welcomed by the Germans because they had impossible schemes which they wanted to carry out. | He thinks numbers of them joined to obtain protection during their journey through Persia. Question (d) .—Before leaving Berlin Winckelmann received orders to report himself to the Embassy at Constantinople. This was the case with all officers sent from Germany, In Constantinople they were placed at the disposal of the Turkish General Staff and received orders from Colonel Eaouf Bey, who was in command of several Turkish regiments and had an independent position. Eaouf Bey’s idea was to take his troops into Afghanistan, and these German officers were placed at his disposal. They entered the Turkish Army and wore Turkish uniform, and were sent forward to Aleppo, which w as a rendezvous. Winckelmann was employed in training troops at Aleppo. Eaouf Bey s forces eventually reached Baghdad, and there a dispute took place between him and the German officers. The latter did not approve of Eaouf Bey s plan of uniting the forces of Islam in Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan,. and separated them selves from him. At this time Winckelmann was ill with typhoid, and does Basrah Times. The following are the only names Winckelmann can recall ;— Captain Hoffman. Lieutenant Uth of the Artillery. Lieutenant Schenker. Military Doctor Schach. Lieutenant Hauck. Lieutenant Bauer, the African explorer. Of civilian names, Stern, a journalist, was one. on sick leave.4 not know wW b o ^ ( ^ SB ^f C ^nrkk 0 r C Gon^l P 94 T to op' roln ioOoi«n- letter from Niedermayer infoimi g . ^im during convalescence command of the expedition, .and ^directmg mm wMch had to act as transport officer m g ^ arrival at Ispahan in August already set out.

Wherever he has gone he has exchanged cans with the officials and was invited to a banquet at Kermaushah on ffie occasTon of the Shah’s coronation. The expeditions were independent of the help of Persian officials and purchased whatever transport and supplies thev required -in the various bazaars. They were everywhere received with enthusiasm, notables riding out miles to meet them, populace standing at the .rates and presents being offered them on arrival. They received no help from the Gendarmerie beyond the usual Consular escorts. The Swedish officers at Kermanshah were Sonneson and, he thinks, Westfal, and at Ispahan Major G^Onestionf^).—Winckelmann has not seen any machine guns himself, nor any -tos as he was always with the advance party. He heard in September from Armourer Frederich that some mountain guns—number unknown—and ten machine guns were expected in Ispahan. At the time he left Kerman thev had not yet arrived (beginning of January 1916). He was not able to ascertain from the main body whether they had arrived as they were not able to send cypher telegrams between Kerman and Ispahan as the Persian Govern ment had not given permission. He did hear that \\ agner had taken two or four mountain guns and ten loads of ammunition into Afghanistan. Niedermayer had no guns of any kind with him, but several convoys have got through near IVIeshed into Afghanistan and may ha^e taken guns A\ith them. He does not know what guns may be following into Persia. There is a wireless installation at Kabul taken there by 'Wilhelm Paschen in August 1915. Another station is to be at Herat but Winckelmann does not know °if it has yet arrived there (i.e., the installation). There is a station at Ispahan which has been working since the summer of 1915. . The station at Kerman is able to receive but not to •The sending P *rt is expected. ^ Dd *. T hi s 8 tation had been taken to Khabis and was there wffien Winckelmann left Khabis. It marches with the expedition and is erected wffien the halt is sufficiently long. Similar installations are with the other expeditions. These are field wireless installations. There are to be more powerful and permanent installations established at Kermanshah, Ispahan (see above) and Kerman. Wincklemann’s expedition has had no news from Afghanistan since August 1915, the reason being that they have been on the march most of the time. News has been received from the Eiffel Tower and Nauen, the latter of which speaks at midnight. Question (/*).—The object of the expedition to Afghanistan was communi cated to Neidermayer, and by him to Seiler. They both refused to make anyo statement on the subject to the other members of the expedition. Winckel- mann’s own idea is that it was intended to establish Consulates in Afghanistan, and the guns that were taken there were meant as presents. Their information is that there are about two thousand of our troops, with machine guns, distributed between Robat and Birjand. Details as to distribution are not known. Information about us was brought to them by Persians of the Democratic party. Not much attention has been paid by the Germans to Sistan, their main route being through Turbat-i-Haidari and Herat. Question (**)•—There are no Bakhtiaris with the Germans. They are fighting independently wdth the object of reaching Tehran, ousting the present Government and declaring war on Russia and England. The Bakhtiaris asked the Germans for money and weapons, hut the German Government refused them this assistance. Question (&amp;).—Winckelmann does not know whether there are any Germans now on the Yazd-Tabbas line. It is not a direct line from Yazd to Tabbas. The route goes Ispahan—Nain—Anarek—Ab-i-Garm—Tab has, and is the one that would be followed by their convoys. Seiler’s expedition is the remainder of the Afghanistan expedition, and as far as Winckelmann knows there is nothing to follow. Question (/)•—Zugmeyer has relations with several chiefs of Persian Balu chistan but Winckelmann does not know who they are. Question («*).—The Germans and Austrians have the latest pattern of infantry rifle. The Levies have their own weapons. These are mostly Prench and English rifles. The Levies supply their own ammunition. Winckelmann does not know how much ammunition for the German rifles there is. In Khabis there were not more than ten boxes when he left. The rifles which the Germans and Austrians have with them are destined for the Consulates which have been, and are to be, established. Question («).—The Germans receive news of the operations in Mesopo tamia through their Consulates in Persia. There is now a powerful wireless station in Baghdad which probably communicates with the wireless stations in Persia. Winckelmann is ignorant of recent events in Mesopotamia. Taken down by me. W. H.

Cox has urged institution of a species of partial blocKade on Government of India in order to put pressure Southern Provinces where, enemy influence is paramount and has proposed that exports of luxuries, e.g., tea, etc., from India to Gulf Ports should be prohibited except to approved persons. But such a measure of further restriction of trade would tend to aggravate finan cial position here as all tea and many other articles which might be equally described as luxuries are now reaching north of Persia only from the south.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran; repeated Foreign.) A separate telegraphic report is being sent you by General Staff re military situation on Tigris. Following is reply to your enquiry re Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Im saw his man Ezra just before leaving for Bushire and arranged a draft agreement with him which he hoped to get the Wali to sign and act up to. This agreement contains an undertaking from the Wali to co-operate with us fully and to afford us all facilities ; and guarantees that neither he nor his dependants shall commit any unfriendly act against us. He undertakes to prevent passage of Turks through his country and to ask for assistance from us if he is not strong enough to expel them himself. In return for this he is to receive a cash payment which will probably not exceed £5,000 or be less than £3,000. Ezra was confident that he would obtain Wall’s signature to this document. This further check on Tigris however is likely to prejudice Wall’s attitude somewhat for the time being, but if no retirement takes place I believe Wali and his people would retire to a safe distance and would passively acquiesce in the passage of Kussian troops. It is believed that Nazar Ali Khan “Amrai”? recently asked Wali what he should do if Russians tried to enter his territory and that Wali replied that Nazar Ali Khan should stand aloof and do nothing. Road from Harunabad (Khoramabad ?) to Mendeli ? passes through the country of Kalhors and not through country occupied by Wall’s tribes. Road from Harunabad to Badrai of course does. 48 Telegram F., No. 152-F., dated the 12th (received 13th) March 1916.

No instructions whatever have been received by the Hussian Minister.^ However we have both discussed frankly with the 1 rime Minister the question of contemplated forces and His Highness is entirely in favour of proposals for forces in North and South organised by ussian and British officers respectively and has expressed his willingness to come to a formal agreement for this purpose. In these circumstances we think that opportunity should not be lost of endeavouring to conclude an alliance, e P^ 111 object of wffiich would be to secure the consent of Persia to the creation of two forces on lines laid down in Articles 2 and 7 of Russian Minis ter s counter-project, sucn questions as the reform of tariff, treaty of Turko- manchai, etc., being reserved for future discussion. In present altered conditions in Persia and North-East Asia Minor regula- a^ions as re^ai s provisions (?) are obviously superfluous while others for same W S ™i Can b +i Set 1 smce tho Pers1aTls them selves recognise that alliance has no longer the same value as it would have had a few months ago. I t9 think the experiment is well worth trying though I am more sceptical than the Russian Minister as to Prime Minister’s ability to make good his professions, and if two Governments agree we would at once draw up representation (?) to counter (.) this and insert such provision in it as we can to ensure permanent character of forces. 1 As the Cabinet is considered unlikely to last long to have any chance of success we must receive authority at once.

I have the honour to enclose in original a letter from Sardar Zafar, Governor-General of Kerman, to Nawab Nasrullah Khan.

I have duly received your letter containing the news of your welfare and arrival at your destination by the hands of Ali Murad Khan and I was pleased to receive it. I am in good health, praise be to God, and pass my days. Government affairs are being carried on precariously and nothing definite is known, and we will see what happens later. Fathullah Khan and your family are in good health and he (Pathullah Khan) is very happy in spite of your anxieties. The sowar guards of your house take due care and will not fail in their duty. I do not know if the Consul is staying at Bunder Abbas or has left there. Please give him my compliments if he is there and enquire after other companions’ health. I expect often to receive your letters and news of your welfare. You should rest completely assured about Pathullah. P.$.—The sowars have arrived, but you should take them to Bunder (Abbas.'). Pathullah Khan is not anxious about you. He comes to see me every week, but I am sorry I intend leaving in the next few days, because I will never tolerate staying at this place, I have sent telegrams to the Prime Minister, Sardar Jang and Sardar Bahadur, asking them to come to the telegraph office, so that I might tender my resignation. I will resign under any circumstances.11 As regards the money in the Bank, I paid f 20,000 tumans to the Finance Department and the Mujahidin took away 25,000 tumans. They intended fighting if they could not take this away. I did not fight for a more important affair, i e., that the Consuls should not leave here: was I to fight the people for the 20,000 tumans? It is said that the British have come to Neh- Bandan. I have no proper news. The Russians have fallen upon the unfortunate people of Persia and are carrying on the work of carnage everywhere. I will hand over Fathullah Khan to a person w r ho will show him kindness. The Gendarmes also show him kindness. KHU 8 RAO BAKHTIARI. G. P. I-.

Copy of an account of the looting of our Bank at Yezd. copy of a letter from our Manager at Bushire, dated 27th February, giving news of our Branch at Shiraz. Now that Isfahan has been occupied by the Russians, Mr. wood has directed the Bank officials to return there with the British Consul, and to report on the position. We shall therefore be faced very shortly with the question of re-opening this important branch, and I need hardly say that it will greatly help us to arrive at a decision if we can receive from Government a reply to our appeal for assistance. Isfahan, as you know, is the place where our losses are likely to be the greatest, though we still have hopes that the Reserve Notes may not have been ma.de away with. Believe me, etc., (Signed) H.

On Saturday 11th December last the Bank in Yezd was opened for business in the ordinary manner. At about 11.30 the Bank was rushed by an armed German force of about 35 to 50, the greater number Austrians, under the command of three German Officers. Twelve Bakhtiari sowars and three police should have been on guard at the Bank. Only two Bakhtiaris were present, these were disarmed. The Austrians rushed into the courtyard of the Bank and levelled their rifles at all the doors and windows. Two Arabs armed with swords, daggers and pistols entered the Accountants room, one seized Mr. Cachnich the Chief Clerk (probably in mistake for myself) and held him against the wall with a dagger at his throat while the other threatened Mr. Nicol, the Accountant, with a sword. I went into the courtyard and shouted for an j ? officer to come forward and on one coming forward requested, him to ca.ll off his Arabs before the Accountant and Chief Clerk were hurt. Two other Officers came forward and I asked them to come into my room; this they did. All the Officers carried Mauser pistols, some six or eight Austrians stood on Guard at each end of my room whilewhile a guard was placed in each of the other rooms; one ojiter gates of the Bank were closed and no one allowed to enter or leave. The Clerks, Cashiers and Perashes were placed in a room at the entrance under guard and. some Austrians were placed on the roof of the Bank. I asked the Germans (who spoke English well) lor an explanation. They informed us (Mr. Nicol ' rue i't . Cachick 'being present) that, acting under oheir orders, they had seized the Bank and were going to take the money, and further, in reply to my questions, stated that their orders were to seize ail the money, notes bills, securities and codes which they could find in the Bank. They then demanded the keys and informed us that if the keys V were not produced they had with them means of breaking into our Treasury. Paced with the alterna tive of having our Treasury dynamited I placed my keys on the table instructing the Accountant to do the same. I protested against their action and pointed out that our Treasury contained not only Bank money, but money, property and securities belonging to Persians. They replied that they would settle with tiie Persians. An Officer named Bernstoff took up the keys and proceeded to the Treasury. I followed with the Accountant and was allowed to agree the Cash in Treasury with the Books before the Germans touched it. I endeavoured to dissuade the Germans from taking the notes without effect, but was able to persuade them from removing the securities in custody which were the registered property of Persians. Mr. Nicol saved the Notes of other Offices by mixing them up with Cancelled Notes. He also saved the bill case by quietly giving it to</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001e5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/590</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001e5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/590</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1110/1916 Pt 1 'Persia: SITUATION (JAN-APL 1916).
