Owing to the disturbed state of affairs in the Punjab and the shortage of railway wagons the amount of merchandise exported to Pakistan and India via Zahidan from Persia decreased considerably. Consequently large quantities of dried fruits, carpets and spices are held mp at Zahidan awaiting despatch to P aids tan by railway. Prices of several commodities of export such as almonds, almond kernels, pistachios and carraway seeds decreased slightly during the month and the general tendency of prices is downwards. (a) n v&gt; Coods. Indian made cloth was in great demand and its price increased to Rials 33 - 43 per yard. The sale of cloth and other imported articles c.i.f. Customs, Zahidan, has practically ceased as in future an import permit from the Iranian authorities will be necessary for the release from the Customs of all imported goods. (b) Tea and 3uf;ar . The price of good quality tea decreased by 20% but that of sugar remained stationary at Rials 48 per kilo throughout the month. (c) Dried fruit. Price decreased slightly and there is no likelihood of the situation showing an improvement until such time as the conditions in the Punjab take a turn for the better. (d) Spices.

A.J.Albert Press, Quetta.The demand for cotton piece goods remained fairly gpod o) during the month. Owing it is said to the failure of the Russians to import cotton piece goods in quantities sufficent to effect prices in Tehran and persistent rumours to the effect that the cotton piece goods quota allotted by the Government of India for Persia will be further reduced, the price of Indian cloth rose to Rials 26-28 per yard c.i.f. Customs at the close of the month. (b) Paragraph 5(a) of June 1946. At a meeting of Persian traders held in Zahidan to discuss the discrimination made by the Government of India in depriv ing them of a share of the cotton piece goods quota allotted for export to East Persia, it was unanimously agreed that the Chamber of Commerce at Tehran be asked to move the Ministry of Commerce to retaliate by making the importation of cloth into Persia subject to production of import permits granted by the Ministry, and that these permits should be given to Persian merchants only. Cc) SUGAR. It was rumoured that Government was planning to sell sugar to the public at Rials 50 per kilo. This did not effect the local market however and the price of sugar rose to Rials 68 per kilo at the close of the month. ( d ) - -?EA. There are persistent rumours that tea will be decontrolled in India from the 1 st of January 1947. This has caused many purchasers of Chinese tea to hold back. Consequently some of the importers who had purchased it$'£* r ''^ Rupees ^/l^/- per lb are not very hopeful of making any-large s profits. (e) SPICES. The spice market was inactive during the month and the stocks held by some of the local traders, pepper excepted, are said to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the local market for several years to come. Owing to increased demand in India for export prices of spices have lately risen considerably there and in some cases are now about 50% in excess of those prevailing at Zahidan. (f) Carpets and dr y fru it. Owing to communal tension in India carpets and dried fruits were in moderate demand In India and prices remained steady. His Majespys oonsui, Zahidan.

J •and the uncertainty of the situation in Azerbaijan, there has been a tendency to hold bad: on the part of buyers and prices of all imported articles with the exception of cotton piece goods and sugar showed a downward trend during the month. The price of Indian cloth remained steady at Rials 24-26 per yard during the month. The rumour about the importation of Cuba sugar into Iran proved to be untrue and the price of sugar rose to Rials 63 per kilo at the close of the month but gur fell to Rials 30-32 per kilo. There was a moderate demand for tea and spices, (b) During the month the authorised banks received Government permission to open documentary credits for ,, B n category goods without production of import licences. This together with the report that Government sterling area exchange was to become freely available at the official rates for import of authorised goods, resulted in a fall in the free market rates, for sterling area currencies.

Consequently the price of India^cloth c.i.f® Customs, Zahidan, went up to Rials 24-26 per yard at the close of the month® Speculation raised the price of gur to Rials 66 per kilo in the first half of the month but owing to a rumour that some firms in Bombay were registering orders for the supply of Cuba sugar for despatch to Iran, it fell to Rials 40 per kilo in the last week of the month. The price of sugar went up to Rials 60 per kilo in the first week but fell to Rials 50 per kilo and remained stationary during the rest of the month® Several consignments of Chinese tea arrived at Khorramshahr during the month. It is said to be inferior to Indian tea but its arrival has caused an appreciable drop in the price of the latter. The dry fruit market in India remained dull hence the marked decrease in the amount of dry fruits exported to India during the month. (b) Para 5(d) of March 1946.

The issue of an order by the Government of India to the effect that * / mill owners ,2 mil3 owners should not manufacture any cloth for export before the 1st of August 1946 has made many traders believe that (1) either the export of c*p e goods to Iran from India will be totally stopped or (2) it will be permitted in exchange for cereals only as already done in the case of other Asiatic countries® This resulted in a rise in price of Indian cloth to L ' Rials 18 per yard c.i.f® Customs at the close of the month® Owing probably to the failure of the expected Russian sugar to materialise, the price of sugar went up to Rials 40 per kilo at the close of the month and is expected to increase further® (b) The local Revenue Department has started selling cloth to the public from the stocks held for issue against coupons. The rates ■ are the same as for issues against coupons but there is no restriction as to the quantity one can purchase.

The export ^ j0 S market on the other hand reiiains unaffected by victory in Europe. '• &gt; Markets for imported goods showed some activity during the-period Sunder report, as speculators anticipate some rise in prices of the goods in the near future. 2 . 2 .^ - PIECE-GOOES . Considerable sales of piece-goods have been•made Vy the Hu 3 si an Trade Agents &amp;mL in response to deman as from Tehran. Reports were current in 2a hi dan that owing to lack of shipping space the quota of cotton piece-goods from United Staoes of America would not be available in the near future. This resulted in the price of Indian cloth held by the Customs at 2a hi dan rising from Rials 9 to Rials 16 per yard. The Zahidan traders however expect a further increase in prices and do not seem willing to benefit by the current rise. Reports have been received of an acute shortage of cloth in Eukran. As all stocks of cotton piece-goods available at Zahidan are invariably sent up country where they fetch better prices, the Baluchis from the country side have to meet their requirements from cloth which is still trlcxling through in small quantities from Afghanistan via zabul. CARP ETC . AS a result of telegraphic instructions from New York TTrms~To. their agents in East Persia to restrict purchases of carpets the demand* for export has fallen, but prices are unchanged. TH«. AND CUGi^R . A rumour spread in Zahidan by hoarders that no supplies of sugar and tea wo Id be imported into Persia this year resulted in an increase in the price of sugar to Rials 120 and tea to Rials 960 per Tabriz! man (3 Kilos) at the close of the month under report. Some business transactions in tea and sugar were concluded at Meshed by speculators. EG0E. Shortage of wheat stocks in Meshed caused a rise in local prices of about 15% . The reason given is of transport difficul ties from outlying villages but the situation in this respect ^ is far easier than a year ago and the rise in price in face of ^ a bumper harvest is due to nothing but the manioulations of the official wheat ring.

The Zahidan Customs authorities were authorised to issue muafoat Namahs for the import of merchandise from abroad at Zahidan instead of the Trade Department in Tehran which facilitated the work of the traders a great deal. The Imperial Bank of Persia was authorised to issue foreign exchange to the public without production of a licence issued by the Foreign Exchange Commission, Tehran. Markets were dull, and there was little demand except for casings and skins.

We have not yet received a report from Zahidan hut have thought it best not to delay our report any further. A copy of the Zahidan report will he forwarded on receipt. 2. A copy of this d. o. and its enclosure is being sent to the External Affairs Dept, of the Government of India under Printed Letter No.166. Yours ever. Consulate General. To:- The Chancery, British Legation, Tehran.ECONOMIC REPORT 'A '. 1. INTRODUCTION . After the political crisis the economic life of Khorasan was for sometime in a state of confusion. Bandits and robbers were at large. Travelling was unsafe, and lorries and buses were frequently held up and the passengers robbed. Thefts and murders were not uncommon; and Saulat’s rebellion and disturbances among the Kurds and Baluchis in Kuchan and Sarakhs were disturbing factors. As a result of this state of unrest there was a considerable rise in the price of foodstuffs, a tendency which was increased by speculation and hoarding. Landlords refused to give wheat to the Revenue Department, and the Police and Revenue officials were helpless. Bread was bad and occasionally hard to get, sugar was rationed, and cloth unobtainable from Government shops. For a time traffic on the roads was almost at a standstill. On the arrival of the Iranian troops, the situation became normal but still prices of foodstuffs remained high. Wheat which was formerly Rials 350 per kharwar is now Rials 1,200 per kharwar and is still difficult to get. The poor people are suffering great distress and even the middle classes are hard pressed owing to the rise in the cost of living. The new Ustandar has done his best to improve the situation and to obtain better conditions for the public. The situation has also to some extent been relieved by the arrival of wheat and sugar from India. 2. FINANCE . Income tax has been levied at random without reference to traders’ business books and has been considerably increased. The rates for foreign telegrams have been doubled and foreign postage increased. 3. FOREIGN TRADE . Owing to the war foreign markets have been restricted and the export trade has decreased, especially during the half year under review. Further causes of dullness in the export market have been the political crisis and disturbances in Khorasan. However, almonds and nuts have been sent to India in considerable quantities and wool also has been sent to India owing to the absence of German buyers. Tea, sugar, wheat and cereals arrived from India. 4. AGRICULTURE . The chief agricultural produce during the winter was sugar beet. As usual it was in abundance and every year there is an increase in the quantity of beet produced as it pays the agriculturists well. The agricultural department and the agricultural Bank have assisted the cultivators by advancing loans and seeds. The agricultural department has also recently advanced loans to the cultivators for the cultivation of cotton. In Zabul wheat, which is there the chief crop, has suffered from lack of water and blight, and also from the Government monopoly which discouraged cultivation as Government gave only a price much below market value for wheat purchased. Owing to abundance of rain and snow it is hoped that the next harvest of wheat throughout the province will be plentiful. 5. PUDUSTRY . There has been no improvement in any industry in Khorasan. Owing to lack of foreign markets the carpet industry has declined. The rise in prices of wool and 'i i labour/labour and the closing of the foreign markets have been the chief causes of its deterioration. 6. ^RA^SPOR™ . Prices of motor spare parts have considerably increased and they are difficult to get. ^yres are not available at all. Considerable numbers of lorries in Meshed are out of action owing to lack of tyres, and several lorry drivers have gone to 'ehran to find employment with the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. There has been less traffic owing to the political situation, as travelling was not safe especially during January and February 1945. As soon the East Persian Auxiliary Transport Service has begun functioning, the rates of transport from Meshed to Zahidan have gone down, and other lorry drivers cannot compete with the Service’s lorries in the carrying of loads for hire.•- 7. STA~E UNDERTAKING A N D PUBLIC U^ILI m Y . The Municipality has organised a poor house in which over 700 poor persons are fed daily. Money is subscribed among traders and landlords and the poor have also benefited from the Shah’s gift in cash. No new undertakings have been started by the Government owing to lack of material resources. 8. SOCIAL . A slackening of regulations during Moharram on the part of the authorities allowed people to have Rauza Khanis in their houses, and there has been some relaxation of control in general in regard to religious ceremonies. The new Ustandar and the British and Soviet Consulate-Generals * gave parties to notables of the town to celebrate the signing of the Treaty. Iranians now freely mix with the Consulate staff and are allowed to come to the Consulate. In general however owing to the rise in the price of necessities and especially the difficulty of obtaining good bread, the people are not contented. (Signed). H.A.N. BARLOW. for'His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan.Confidential British Vice-Consul ate, Zahidan Dated the 14 th June 1942 . ANNUAL KBTOBT EOQNOMIO “A*. 1 . INTBODUGrTION , / € -. (a) The in^ortance of the iTok: Kundi-Zahidan land route fbr purposes of trade between India and Iran greatly increased since Germany invaded TJ.S.S.B. in June 1941 . The outbreak of * ^ hostilities with Japan on December 1941 also added to its importance because the despatch of trade goods through ports in the Persian Gulf was curtailed for want of shipping facili ties. as a consequence the flow of trade for all parts of Persia was diverted to the land route via Nok Kundi-Zjfcidan. (b) as a direct result of the entry of British and Soviet troops into Persia and the abdication of the Shah many of the Monopoly restrictions imposed on trade were abolished. Individual traders consequently were enabled to import from India commodities of public necessity such as sugar, loaf sugar, tea and cloth in huge quantities which accumulated in Nok Kundi pending removal by lorries. fiuifUP^c) The/^rates ibr all food stuffs and other necessities of i 0 ’ life had risen considerably especially cereals, ghi, tea, rice I and vegetables. The increases ranged from 3 to 400 and even I 600 % than those prevalent in the preceding six months, i.e., 1 st March 19 41 to 31 st August 19 41 . ( 2 ) (a) The value of imports during the period under report, i.e., 1st September 1941 to 28 th February 1942 , including consignments of wheat and cement imported by the Persian Government from India by the Nok Kundi-Zahidan land route was Rupees 3 , 153,878 against Rupees 2 , 358,874 in the preceding six months? chief items of imports being? Tea Rupees. 2 , 262,272 Cement 125,353 Sugar 221,004 Piece-goods 264,360 tfheat 67,905 Slices 58,919 Vegetable oil 18,176 Haberdashery 9,548 Bicycles 7,327 Chemicals 2,850 Glassware 1,443 (b) Total value of exports from Persia to India over the Zahidan-Nok K n ndi land route during the same period was Rupees 10 , 003,840 as compared with Rupees 3 , 296,138 during preceding six months. The chief items of exports were as follows?- Almonds and Nuts. Spices Carpets Drugs Dried fruits TC)Ol. Skins Intestines Poppy seeds Rupees 6 , 793,196 1 , 290,855 502,680 352,344 25,610 456,420 77,370 31,509 457,504 the 2 . FIN AN CBS . (a) Owing to reasons explained at 1 (b) above the financial position of those connected with trade increased c onsiderably since imports from abroad and exports from Persia both fetched very favourable prices, liie traders were able to save foreign currency over and above the amounts for which they executed bonds to sell foreign exchange realised in mar-kets a’broad to tbe Persian Grovernment under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, and thus n/ere al3ie to 'build up credits in India as well. Cb) The Baluchi population of the Province had an easier time, during the period under report in carrying on their smuggling trade (one of their principal occupations) 'because the Persian authorities were afraid to apply any severe preventive measures against the smugglers after the entry of British and Soviet troops into Persia. Both Baluchis and other ordinary individuals with an average income were how ever hit hard 'by the excessive prices of all necessities of life especially food stuffs. Majay instances of great hard ships were reported and a number of Baluchis were reported to have died of starvation. The deaths would have 'been greater hut thousands of Baluchis were enrolled as labourers in the Labour Companies entrusted with the work of improvements to the MLrj awa-Meshed and Zahidan-Bam roads. All coolies thus employed were provided with rations. 3 . FOREION TRADE . The chief imports from abroad via the Nok Kundi-Zahidan land loute during the period under report have beenj- . Tea apices . Haberdashery Glassware Chemicals. Bicycles. Cloth. Sugar. TTheat. Cement. From India. * India. ^ Japan via India. ' * India. * India. * United Kingdom. H India. * India. * India. * India. 4 . AGRICULTURE . During winter there were heavy rains throughout Mukran enabling land owners to carry out all the sowings they desired but owing to lack of supplies of wheat seed it is reported that very small areas were brou^it under cultivation around # Khwash, Iranshahr and Saravan. The outlook therefore for the next harvest to be good enough to make ifukran independent of supplies from other wheat producing districts of Iran is not hopeful and quantities will have to be imported from Sistan or other places outside aiukran. Quantities of wheat had to be imported from India to feed the population of the Mukran and Khorasan Provinces but the Baluchis did not receive sufficient fbr their needs even on payment and they continued to be under fed and nearly half starved. 5 . INDUSTRY . Nil. 6. TRANSPORT . Owing to the acute shortage and high cost of lorry tyres in Persia the use of ifotor transport decreased and the rate of hire rose sharply. Large profits were made by those em ployed in carrying trade goods on the Zahidan-Nok Kundi road because the rates, owing to competition among traders to bring in their consignments before their licenses expired, went as high as 350 Rials per 650 Ibs.sa figure never previously touched. Zz ST ATE UNDERTAKINGS . (a) An Anti-Locust Operation Mission from Tehran visited iifiikran where swarms of locusts were reported to have arrived in Saravan District. The locusts however did no damage and flew off without laying eggs. It was reported that the starv ing Baluchis did not allow measures to be carried out againstA 'T&gt;e» and s ol Rials ^ WxJ the insects hut collected great quantities for them to each other at prices Varying between 3 per Tabriz! man (6i lbs). (b) Financed by the British Government work was commenced in November 19 41 on the widening and improvement of the (1) :£Lrjawa-Meshed and ( 2 ) Zahidan-Bam-Kerman roads. The roads were split up into sections and given out to contractors under the technical control of Kampsax Ltd., an engineering firm previously engaged on railway contraction inpersia, acting as Representatives of the British ooverniBnt and who in turn were under the authority of the Chief Road jsngineer of the British Military Command in Iran and subordinate offi cers posted at different places on the roads. At the end of the period covered by this report w ork was s till in progress. (c) The Bast Persia Auxiliary Transport Service - a British Oovemmait Organisation started functioning in December 1941 for transporting supplies for Russia from Nok Kundi to Meshed. The service has also been helpful in carrying back loads of trade goods, from Meshed to Zahidan and Nok Kundi and thus keeping rates comparatively low which other -wise would have also risen like those between Nok Kundi- Zahidan and Meshed. §jl —g.SLQlAk« Contact with Persians has become considerably easier since the entry of British and soviet troops. The ban forbidding officials to visit British consulate ttraar thougi never actually lifted has in practice been ignored and Heads of Departments freely accept invitations to social functions at the Vice-consulste.
