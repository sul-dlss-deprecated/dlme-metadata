The increased demand for bran is quoted as an example of abnormality. Bran is required tof eed transport animals. More bran is required now than five, or even two, years ago because (a) dates, which used to be fed to transport animals, are now kept exclusively for human consumption (b) transport animals are used more and more as motor transport ceases to become available owing to shortage of spnre parts and tyres. In other words, the increased demand for bran is a necessary and inevitable consequence of economic conditions brought about by the war. Unless Bahrain and the Trucial Coast can import food for animals, these animals must starve, facilities for transport will be further reduced, and eventually the carriage of goods will become impossible. Bran is, in present circumstances, a commodity essential to the economic life of the community on the Arab side of the Gulf, and it would be difficult for a Political Agent, consistently with his duty to the inhabitants of the areas in his political charge, to comply strictly with the Government of Indian instructions to make future programmes conform t*o~ M the normal level of exports'• *** *** *«* #4141.SO' /a ^f ® No. ' of IS62 Office of the Adviser to the G-overnment, Bahrain Dated, 21st Shawal, 1362 October 21, 1943. H. B. M T s Political A{j;ent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - Bran is used extensively in Bahrain for feeding cattle and other animals. It is given to cows, mixed with fish. In the past it was-imported mainly from India. The export of bran from India is no longer allowed Representations have been made to the Bahrain Government by cattle ov/ners asking that steps should be taken to make a supply of bran available. The Bahrain Government has endeavoured to obtain bran from Basra, through a firm of local merchants with an agency in Basra but • • telegraphic information has now arrived stating that no bran is procurable in Basra though there is a possibility of obtaining some from Baghdad. annual According to the Customs figures the/imports of bran over the last five years from 1938 averaged 3100 bags. I should be grateful if you could possibly assist us in obtaining permission to export as much of this quantity as may be allowed from India. Adviser to the Government.No .C/1421. Political Agency, Bahrain, 25th October 1943. From To Sir Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon* ble Lhe Political Kesident in the Peraian Gulf, Buahire. - I have the honour to enclose a memorandum which 1 have received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Oovernmen on the subject of the * rovieion of bron for the feeding of cattle and other animela in Bahrain. / l 7 k 2. i;*hile in Delhi in July thia year, I llacuaaed the (j question of the export of bran to Kuwait and was informed by the Deputy Secretary in the Foreign Department that he would consider the question as early as possible. * .“J* s^e, from Government of India 'ixpresa Letter No.65bl-N/43 dated the 10th September 1943, that the question ia still under consideration. I request that everything possible be done to reach an early settlement as the position with regrrd to the feeding of animals in Bahrain ia very serious indeed. If the situation deteriorates much further, the transport of human baings and supplies will be affected as the already overburdened donkeys will not, owing to shortage of food, be fit for work* *** Bn extreme may be reached when owing to lack of nourishment milk supplies will be much reduced with the resultant under-nourishment of the juvenile population. 3. When I was in Basrah recently I gathered that there were quantities of bran available in the Baghdad area Ju.rt as described in the enclosure to this letter and 1 also understood that Iraq had © considerable surplus of barley. In the event of India not being able to supply our needs In the immediate future, I will be grateful if the U.K.C.C be approached through the Middle test Supply Council with a view to making bran or barley available from stocks at present in being in Traq. Bran is preferable to barley as the figure at which bnrley would be made available would probably be beyond the means of any but the richer merchants I have the honour to be, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, .

Whether we can take it or not will depend entirely on the price. 3. When I was in Basra recent^ I gathered thfft there were fairly large stocks of ^Boosa” available.

The Government of India have considered the question • of improving present procedure in regard to supply Of ^ enls to the Persian Gulf generally, and have come to the concilsion that so f&amp;r as bran is concerned, the existing procedure of fixing a arterly quotas should continue. The quotas, fixed by the overnmert of India will howevei be overall quotas for the whole of the Persian Gulf, tne sub-division of these quotas between t ^8 varjoss Sheikhdoms being left to the discretion of Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Names of exporters to whom allotments have been made during each quarter should be intimated to the Government of India in respect of all Sheikhdoms. 3 # Similarly the Government of India have no objection to the Political Resident allotting quotas to Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms according to t;heir requirements inrespect of veg table hee, provided ad/unce iiifo-Tsiutiori j.s se.ic abo w.ie shippers nominated by the -olitical Agents in respect of each q arter.

The Government of India want to make it clear in this connection that they hold out no guarantee that full quantities demanded will be allowed to be exported. iffhile every endeavour will be made to meat the roquiremants of the Gulf to maximum extent possible, actual exports allowed will depend upon the Supply position in the country each year.

The correspondence is mainly between the Political Agent for Bahrain, the Director of Customs and Port Officer for the Government of Bahrain, and officials in the Government of India External Affairs Department, New Delhi. They discuss minimum annual requirements for the local consumption of bran in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms; the quarterly and half-yearly distributions (in tons) of the bran quota among approved merchants in Bahrain, Dubai and Sharjah; the regular quota reductions imposed by the Government of India Food Department owing to acute shortages in India and the unavailability of a surplus for export and Government of India revised export control procedures. The file also contains merchants’ correspondence, from importers in Bahrain and their export agents and shippers in Karachi, complaining about the refusal of the Export Trade Controller in Karachi and other Government of India controlling authorities, to grant export licences and permits. Included in the file are numerous lists containing the names of all approved importers of Indian quota bran in Bahrain, Dubai and Sharjah, as well as the names and addresses of their export agents and shippers in Karachi.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karachi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Cereals</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cf#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
