Head of European Department of Ministry of Foreign Affairs said recently that he agreed that we were quite justified in protesting at the action taken in Bushire when the matter was under discussion here. The naval authorities denied, however, having sent message threatening to raiove stripes by force and he thought that their representative^ in Bushire must have misunderstood them or the Governor him. Ministry of Foreign Affairs were now awaiting written report from Governor and expected that he would also be communicating with you. 2 . I am now enquiring whether report has been received and, as soon as I hear that it has, shall press strongly for full apology. Please telegraph if Governor makes any approach to you whether it be to apologise or not. 3. Reference third paragraph of your telegram. I think that the only change that is necessary is in the stripes. Simplest plan would seem to be to have no stripes but, if you think smartness demands some form of stripe, I suggest that you should avoid colour white and number three. I do not think there could be any objection to, for instance, single red stripe. SEYMOURCONFIDENTIAL.

He added however that Iranian Government maintained their objection to three stripes and also to blue cuffs worn by launch crew. 2.

On the 26th May, Motamedy, Head of our Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, read out to Trott a communication from the Ministry of tfar to the effect that sailors at Bushire, not employed in official forces, were wearing clothes which were very similar to the uniforms of ratings of the Iranian Navy. In particular the crew of the Residency launch wore clothes with a turn-down collar with three white stripes on it and 'blue cuffs. This was very like the uniform of similar ranks in their l\avy. The Ministry of V/ar thought that, in order to distinguish 'between the two, it would 'be a good thing if the launch crew were to alter some of the details of their uniform; in particular to substitute some other colour for 'blue on their collars and cuffs, and to have one stripe instead of three on their collars. Trott said that he supposed that the launch crew had worn their clothes long before the Iranian Navy existed. Motamedy took the line that this might be so but the launch crew’s uniform was esentially a private one, and that it was desirable that it should not be liable to be mistaken for the official naval uniform. He asked therefore that the alterations indicated above should be made in it. 3/ The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.* 2. This is an annoying and rather cool request. It is one thing to flatter hy imitation, and quite another to ask that the Paris model, after one has copied it, should he changed. But prima facie it seems not altogether unreasonaLle and my feeling is that it is the kind of request that should he complied with unless it involves great inconvenience. Perhaps you would let me know in due course what you feel about it. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to Rendel and Caroe.
