This is a project of the Persian Railways Syndicate, K'r. Ureenway beinp, the moving spirit. Though there is a 'Persian lining Syndicate* it appears to be identical with the Railways Syndicate, many of whose projects in Southern Persia are connected with the mining area. This area ia a rough square; the north side being a line due west from Abadeh to the 60th parallel, which forms the east side; the west is due south from Abadeh just east of Shiras; the south side follows the coast line some 30-40 miles inland. Thus the area is clear of the Russian sphere (on which point Russia insisted), and lies to quite half its extent in the neutral zone, and is cut off from the sea. 2. The concession which ths Syndicate aims at ia one drawn up in 1910 by Mr. Preece for Mr* Tarbett Fleming. It provides for the exploitation of ail minerals in the specified area, for the construction of the necessary tramways, buildings and works; the construction of ! a etc.,, on 2 points on the C-ulf to be connected up by tramways with the ., minea. The right to buy land for the abore operations; freedom from all imposts except a royalty to the ^ ei ‘‘ 10 * on all net profits. The concession to run for 60 years. On the conclusion of this period and that of the Railway concession the Syndicate will advance £100,000 to iersia. 3. The Persian Government has a counter-draft, the main differences being - 20 years period for research, 60 for workiwg the concession: The exception of precious metals and stonss, petroleum and naphtha, lime and building stones. A control over building plans and a limitation of each working area. If* share in the capital plus 6* royalty on all subsidiary compani^ e.g. for tramways etc., £30,000 to be deposited and paid over on signature of the concession; £7,500 forfeit if a working \ corjpajfiycompany is not foraod within ten years, 4, Mr# Oreenway wants Mr# Preece’s draft accepted, and in thic the Foreign Office support him# Failing it, he will negotiate on the Persian counter-draft, if it is amended to include the use of building stone, to exclude restriction of each working area, and Persian control over building plans# Mr. Greenway agrees to a forfeitable deposit of £7,500 which would be increased to £30,000 and paid, on signature of the concession# He would prefer po keep Persian capital out, but would in the last event accept 1(&amp; share in capital and royalty# 5. negotiations proceeded on these lines# In June, 1913, however, the Russian Government intervened on behalf of the 3oci$t4 d* EHude, (the international syndicate created to examine the trans-Persian railway project,)pointing out that the concession area is that through which trans-Persian Railway would run, that all Railway concessions in the east include the mining rights on each side and that without these the Railway's success would be threatened# It suggested reciprocal grant of facilities in Russian and British spheres, and equal division of interest in the neutral zone# 6# Mr# Ureenway objects to the intrusion of the Joei4t4, pointing out that the grant of the concession was to oe a condition of the Syndicate's acceptance of the option for the Mohamaierah-Khorremabad Railway; that the £100*000 his .i.cate is to advance on conclusion of the two concessions, was in return for a mining monopoly in the specified area# Re points out that he was first on the spot, and had practically conclude the affair with Jhuster in 1911# In spite of this, he is willisjg.if His Majesty's Government presses it, to consider the admittance of the 3oei4t£ to a ^ snare in the enterprise, so far as the neutral zone is concerned.
