HOYAL AIR iJ^OHGE, BASRA, ' IxtAk. 30th May, 1934, Dear I am anxious to carry out some night flying training this summer. Basra is unsatisfactory as it is impossible to control the river traffic, which makes night flying dangerous. Bo you think there would be any objection to night flying at Bahrein? Depending on the wind direction, we might have to take off over the town, but would avoid it as much as possible. It would mean two Flying Boats being at Bahrein for a period of approximately ten days carrying out night flying from 21.00 hours nightly. If there is no objection forthcoming, perhaps you would let me have the following inform ation; - (a) Can we hire a launch? (b) Can we warn anyone who is likely to be sailing or fishing in the alighting area? Flares would be lit, indicating the alighting area. A clear area of at least 1000 yards by 400 yards is required. Sorry to worry you, and hope you can help us. Kind regards to yourself and Mrs. Loch. Did you know that Flying Officer Supple, 84 Squadron, died of malaria, and Squadron Leader Vincent is still very ill with it? yours ttJUVA Lieutenant-Colonel G. LOCH, The Agency, BAHREIN. t. %SECRET # D.0.No:C/583 9th June 1934 r s Saul, Will you kindly refer to your demi-oflicial letter No:12/6/Air dated the TiOth May 1934 about night flying training at Bahrain. 2. I do not think that there will be any objection and I will asx the Shaikh when I see him shortly. But I hope that you will be able to come down and get of! sufficiently far away not to disturb the people. Tempers are sufficiently frayed by the weather eyen with a night T sleepl 3. A launch can easily be hired (Rs.40 to Rs.GO a day roughly) and, with notice, warnings could be issued. 4. flfould you kindly let me have a signal saying between what dates you would like to come, so that I may tell the Bahrain Government. 5. i am very sorry indeed to hear of the death of Plying Officer Supple, and of Squadron Leader Vincent's illness. It was only the other day that they were here. Yours sincerely, D Sroup Captain R.E.Saul, E.F.C., Officer Commanding. c03 (F.B) Squadron R.A.F., Basrah.j S E C R B T . D.0.No:C/594. 14th June 1934. P-s My dear Saul, In continuation of my demi-official letter No:C/583 dated the 9th June 1934, I write to say that I mentioned the question of night flying to the Shaikh, who was interested and had no objection. He, however, asked me to tell him when it was to take place. I hope, therefore, that you will giie me a few days 1 notice so that I can write and let him know; and also communicate with the Adriser's Office.
