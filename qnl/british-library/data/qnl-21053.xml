Bahrain Reforms* It is the ardent des ire of the Government of India t hat they should not be drawn into interference betw een the Ruler of Bahrain and his subject s. But as the proposed reforms are mainly due to their warning against opression etc^, and appear sound in themselves you are authorised to inform the Sheikh that Government welcome his scheme and will lend their moral support to an honest attempt to put it in force impartially. This authority is given on the understanding that you feel that more than moral support is unlikely to be required. But nothing should be done to encourage idea that Sheikh is introducing reforms at Government dictation. Hence you should consider whether better plan would not be for Sheikh to make announcement shortly before your arrival. Another meeting might then be hald at which you should congrat ulate Sheikh on introduction of reforms and express hope that they will prove of lasting benefit to whole community. Sheikh should of course be encouraged to set aside funds for public works, but it does not appear advisable for him to be definitely required to do so» flOopy of the undermentioned papers is forwarded, with compliments, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information, with reference to this Office endorsement No. 329-S dated the 5rd Hay 1922.

Keaorandom Kindly re er to eQ^ggpondanee re sting-with this office Ho lll/O of 3/?/2?. Since M r return from recess I have devoted mu@h time *z consideration to the reforms whiek the Government of India desired should be introduced into Bahrain vide your Ho 1217 1922, The main necessity for tka introduction of certain reforms,as far as Great Britain is concerned in the capacity of Protecting Power,is on account of the accusation which is frequently made ,that the British authorities connive at the victisiisation 0 ' the shimih population, I and at the very serious abuses which have crept into the diving industry,rendering the divers,ninety per cent of whom are foreigners - und r British prote«tio , slaves'in all but the name. It is said that Great Britain in handing over the rulership tp Shaik: ^asa,had stipulated that he should rule with equity &amp; Irf accordance with the dictates of humanity &lt;5; has,on .iore than one occasion, assisted him to assert his authority,but has taicen no steps to eheci his abuse of the same in late years,nor to insist on a reasonably ef icisnt form oft Goverimento The above protest is frequently made to a© St I am asked | whether protection is afffartded erely to the rulers, to the detriment I of their subjects. They are substantially the saae arguments as were | brought forth on the occasion of the demonstration la t year, f 'en you visi'ted Bahrain. During the last few months the position of the %hrainis| whom the Shailts have onen more subjected to considerable oppression, has been const r bro ^-tt oo &gt;.dj notite y Persians,who t s co religionists take a lively interest in their affairs &amp; I learn that certain members 0 ' the Persian community are in close touuh with the leaders of the 3e hrainis. A good deal of the agitation for Bahrain toN be reeoguisad as an inte ral )art of Per da aaj - ,I believe orig be tra©ed to their relations with dissatisfied Bahraisis .As jou are a war® there are large eo la unities of Bahrainis at Iiingeh Jluha merak, &amp; Bandar Abbas, mar: ,7 of who i, own property both in Persir Jo Bahrain. A loading Bahraini,Ahmad al Khaais,himself a person who was perseeated bj the racers some /ears ago &amp; whose ease was reported to /ou. £t the time bj the Political gent,Major Di ©icson, recently visited • 9 before leaving for India. He said his eommnitj were saaeh disappoint -ad at receiving no replj to their petitions to Gk)vema«nt ' had eo^e to the conclusion that they could expect no redress unless as the result of agitation,I gathered that it was their intention to carry on a campaign in the Press.If this is the ease it will undoubtedly be due to advice from Persians &amp; it laaj be anticipated that attaclca will not onlj be made on the Huler but on the British Governimnt vhieh \ ill be accused of connivance. I have been at pains to discover the causes of the increased unrest of late years &amp; believe them to be- 1. Great increase of wealth of the ruling fauily due to vastly improved customs receipts &amp; seizure of property from Bshrainis bj force. 2. Increased power of the rulers to oppress as a result of I. 5* Events of lite years in Iraq,India iigypt which have been closely followed &amp; a greatly increased tendency of the inhabitants to travel &amp; consequent enlightenment of their leaders. 4* The repressive policy of the Rulers,who are More ignorant 4 less travelled than the majority of their subjects,5; have taizen no steps to educate the cadets of the family. 5. The influence of He 1 spapers which, since the war, are isaoorted in considerable numbers froia Egypt,India, Iraq &amp; Persia * which have given rise to ideas of desaocracy coMpketely on posed to the antiquated St autocratic rule of the Shaiks, 6. The influx of foreigners each pearling season. Although the reforms which could be profitably introduce in accordance with estern standards are innumerable,it see s desirable to consider only those which are essentiel to! 1 the -roteeting Power to refute the aceas^tion of eon liv^nce &amp;t oppression* 3aeh reforms would ©ostprise. 3 1. Satroduetion of some s/tesa into the taxation to ensure some equality of ineidenee. 2. Introduction of some eourt in which 3hi hs ©ar; obtain redresses opposed to the present s/steia wherbj ever/ member of the ruling fajail/ imprisons &amp; otherwise puni; bias at xd-lli' 3 Insistence on the proper observation of diving rules &amp; maintenanee of accounts between Nakhadas &amp; divers &amp;■ the production of accounts in court in t v e event of dispute,as • opposed to the present system v ^/herebj the Hakhadas absolutely decline to produce their accounts before any court,except one man appointed &amp; paid bj themselves &amp; who is notoriously unjust to the divers. There ©re no insuperable difficulties in formulating schemes to obtain the above ends,but it will be useless to put forward any seheae unless we £ re prepared to insist that any proposals I finally approved,of by Government wi 1 be insisted on &amp; moreover 1 steps taiien to ensure that they are carried out. The rulo rs may be relied on to readily accepjs any part of such schemes from which th«y will personally derive benifit. for example the imposition of taxs upon Sunnis who have kifherl avoided payment,but they rpuld avoid carrying out the more distasteful portions such as the int^roduction of some Judicial system &amp; the abolition of unfair taxes on shiahs. 3u@h results ^ ould increase rather than decrease the criticism . of the Protecting Power. As explained to fou verbally &amp; as you are no doubt •well aware Shaik: Sir iilasa Bin Ali is now completely in his dotage, though | in good bodily health.Ho amount of persuasion of argument by his sons or notables has any effect &amp; he now invariably refuses to consider a ay change of any Icind ^ declines to give any reasons for his refusal. He is absolutely dominated by his wife,an ignorant v : oman &amp; a sheer despot. Her son Shaii Abdul la having been remove 1 from the conduct of affairs her omy ^ .ibition is to induce Shaii -^asa to always oppose' ■■■■ (2D* ajij chkaga roeoinraendad to him bj the heir Apparent to iceep eontrol of all affairs antirelj in his own hands. As an QxiiMpl0 f for two ja-rs the IIuniGipalitj of ^anasiah have been endaavouring to gain the rulers eonsant to a scheno for tha sap &gt;1/ # of water bj means of artesian wells &amp; •for a la e trie power for t ha Town.

I sea no possible serious diffieulty in enforcing any such decision if it be tf-ce®. ShaiiC i&amp;isa is quite incapable of taking any decision, of understanding the situation in his own dominions or of perform ing any of the funetions of a ruler.The older he gets the more difficult will the situation become.It is obvious that great difficulty will be e::perieneed in tha matter of the exploitation I i a of oil in Bahrain the ShaiJiC will never personally agree to it j exeapt under pressure. * Shaik llamad is reasonable &amp; progressiva , though ignoranl &amp; will al ays accept advice ^ agree to any proposals approved bybpabli« opinion.

His poliej when approached on an/ subject is to refer the matter to 3haik Hamad &amp; tell him to ettle it.

There is some reason to 'believe, to9, that in pressing their old claim to the possession of Bahrain as they are doing at present, the Persian Government are influenced by the complaints of Bahrain! s n of whom, as Government are aware, there are large com munities in Lingah, Dundar Abbas, am ^ohammerah# All this merely confirms the opinion of the Foreign || Office, which you quoted in your telegram of the 10th * Julyi&amp;st, that for the sake of the well-being of the Shi ah population, and of our good name, the administration | of Bahrain Is in great need of improvement• The reforms which Western Standards might suggest I as desirable are numerous? but it is not necessary to consider for the purpose of practical politics, more than the mintaum necessary for the removal of the most flagrant abuses* These ares- (a) The inequality of taxation as between surmis who evade all payment at present, and ghiahs# To remedy this the introduction of an ecfuitable system of taxation is called for* (b) The liability of Shiahs to imprisonment and any other punishment at the mere whim of the ruler and his family without any kind of legal sanotlom a state of things v*hich demands the introduction of a regular Judicial system. (c) The complete disregard of the diving rules,andf / and the resulting injustice to the divers who ar@ at th© mercy of the naldrudas especially in the matter of their accounts. The observance of the rules* proper maintenance of accounts* and their production before some impartial tribun^al, tast be enforced# 4« The creation of machinery suitable for the purpose of carrying out such reforms would be a comparatively simple matter• But before entering upon details* it appears to me advisable to examine the consequences which their introduction is likely to involve in the conditions at present ruling in Bahrain, which make the problem more difficult jiot solution than when Government last considered the question• S* The difference lies in the increased obstinacy and obstruct!veness of Bhei!&lt;h Isa himself• ffoen I delivered the Government of India warning to him in March 1022* he was thoroughly alarmed by the demonstrations of the Bahrain!s* and by the fear that drastic action was going to be taken• His fears speedily wore off when he found that nothing happened* and the question of reforms was not pressed• Since then his character seems to be steadily deteriorating, owing no doubt to increasing age. Though physically he appears to be in sound health* mental ly he is in his dotage. Completely dominated by an ignorant and despotic wife, he is utterly opposed to change of any sort except such as will directly increase his income without adding to his responsibilities. As 11 * V an example of the old man t s intransigepce Major Daly reports that the Hunicipallty of Manameh have been trying in vain for the last two years to secure his consent to a scheme for the supply of water and electric power to the town. The whole -unicipal council supported by nearly all the notables and both his sons approached himhim recently and bogged hlin to give hi a approval* Though ho was not asked to contribute in anyway to the cost of the undertaking, and was even offered a royalty on the water, he resolutely refused to agree, and would assign no reason for hi a refusal which is depriving the in habitants of much needed benefits* As an example of hi© i credulity and ignorance Major Daly nentions the followimt'i The roads near Mianaciah are being repaired and Hajor Daly procured some old rails discarded by the Army for use for mall bridges* The Sheikh refused to allow these to be used on the ground they were Government pro perty, and (kJVernment would claim the ground they were inl | 6* if such is his attitude to schemes of purely material progress urged on him by his own family and subjects| it can be supposed that there is no hope j whatsoever that the gheildt will ever agree, save under } strong compulsion, to the introduction of administrative || changes which he would regard not as reform but as re action, and which are desired only by the Shi aha, and by the British Go Vermont * indeed euch is his intract- I ability that it is extremely doubtful whether even f strong moral compulsion would induce him to agree* A year ago, a hint of aovernment's severe displeasure would probably have moved him* t do not think it is likely to do so now* And if that failed, it would have to bo followed up by a show of material force, or by a tightening of moral pressure - ending ultimately (for I can see no alternative) in the threat of deposition If he were to continue in an attitude of passive resistance* In all human probability such a threat would bring the Sheikh, and his wife, to their senses? but if it did not Government would have no choice but to carry out its threat, and that would only be done by a resort to force, however embarassing the circumstances* TnIn fact, once it is dooided to 'bring prossuro to bear.

S29-S dated 18th July 1928 (ouod vide) The one easy solution is the natural succession of SheiMi J Ha^ad vtiio though ignorant is reasonable and progressive* He could be trusted to introduce the reforms hteself with th© advice of his Political Agent; and oovernraent would be relieved of the unpleasent alternative of tolerating abuses or forcibly intervening to end them* But that solution need not be anticipated for some time. 8# For all practical purposes at present therefore (rovemnent is presented with a choice between these two alternatives, either of which is attended with difficulty.

But X foel bound respootfully to point out that in ny opinion sooner or later something will have to be dono# Present inaction may only result in our hands being forced later on# On the other hand, if the matter is firmly grasped now f this advantage will at least follow that some definite good will be aooonplished and an unsatisfactory condition of affairs ended• It would seen, then # that if action is to be taken it should be taken as soon as conveniently possible, but T recognise that it May be some time before the orders of H.H•0overment can be obtained# In the neamrhile X an prepa^ring the details of the required machinery which I hope to be able to submit to Government for their c approval if necessary, as soon as I am ^fiuainted with their decision. 9m To sum up, my opinion is as follows:- (i) The state of affairs in Bahrain calls for reform more urgently than ever. (ii) But in hie present mood the £&gt;hei&amp;h may not yield even to strong moral pressure; and ooVornment must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if they are determind to carry through the Reforms. (iii)Forcible intervention is bound to attmot hostile criticism; but so too is inaction; and at any rate the former has toe merit of achieving some good, while the latter may be merely putting off the evil day.

A scheme for minimising opression &amp; administration of simple Justice . 3* Reforms in taxation. If you would kindly let me know whether you approve of the broa lines of my proposals I will then send in my detailed report. | I. Diving. With the object of protecting the interests of the divers who are entirely illiterate and patting a stop in future to the usury and fakea accounts whereby the divers are to all practical purposes enslaved, I wouli suggest the formation of a Registry for the maintenannee of registers containing the accounts # under the supervision of a 'Diving Committee 1 The committee to consist of a President &amp; six members , appointed by common consent of the Ruler &amp; P.A. They would have a parmanant clerk who would maintain registers. All divers would be required to take a license and furnish certaii particulars ,for which a small annuUi fee would be charged. The commitie would summon each Kakhuda to appear with his divers before the season opens &amp; to pay the usual advances -x■V laiown as Salaf.in tba preseiic© of the committee. Th® necessai*^ -en would be made in the account of each diver in the registers &amp; attested b t 7^ the committee. They would similarly attest payments at the close of the season. The accounts entail only about three entries a year in each man's account &amp; are extremely simple. A fee would be deducted from the cash paid in the presence of the Court at a certain fixed small percentage,which the diver might reasonably be called upon to pay for having his interests guarded effectively. Also each Hakhuda would be called upon to pay a small annual tax for each diver fjmployed by him. The Revenue accruing from the above would of course be colledtel by he committee on behalf of the Huler &amp; out of it he would pay the clerk &amp; the ■i President &amp; members. In return he would be providing machinery | to curtail abuses &amp; protect the divers. There are a good many details which I nsird not mention here,but would include in the , report. The divers being wholly illiterate cannot check the li entries made in their accounts by the ifakhudas &lt;§5 as both sides invariably lie freely only sdme such sysytem as the above by which payments are made in the presence of &amp; accounted for by an Official tribunal could ever be relied on &amp; put a stop tp abuses. The taxes derived would be not inconsiderable might have the effect of gaining the sympathy of the Rulers for tte reform. You will remember that when you delivered the Govt, of India warning to the Shaik &amp; Abdalla.you charged the latter to assist in reforming these abuses. I would propose that Shaik Abdulla should be asked to become President of tl$ committee.lt would be a sop to the Shaiks ,as they would be outwardly running their own ' show 1 ,&amp; receipts would be sufficient to allow of a handsome remuneration to Abdulla for his services,which would be alluring to him. It should be understood that an Agency Representa would attend the meetings ex-Officio &amp; the proceedings should be conducted in public like the Joint Court &amp; Majlis A1 Urfi.The P.A. would sometimes attend as a spectator which would keep things ap to the mark. Politically it would be advantageous to have frfrj-Brfr . Abdulla employed,&amp; if he were President there would not be ±fc£±teii difficulty in getting members &amp; getting them to aeeept salariesCBfJ This point is important since the work would be fairly ardaoa ^ ^ &amp; noone would he keen on it unless there was something to be pot o of it. They would here to sit about four times a week for a month before the diving and a month after once a week in the interim to sttle disputes. There should be the right to appeal to the Joint Court i.e to the Heir Apparent &amp; the P.A. With these safe guards &amp; owing to the fact that there are several members the Court could hardly become corrupt as is the case with the present 'Salifeh'. Without a member o^ the Ruling family to give it 'tone' the Hakhudas would so ridieule the members for accepting payment that nobociy would accept the Job t &amp; without remuneration it would be unreasonable 'to ©xpoci; so ranch public serrioo. If yon think the schema reasonable I would propose to talk the matter oyer with Hamajd &amp; Abdftlla* 0}ho latter would,X thini£ f liice th® Job &amp; has the br&amp;ins to ns^ke it a saocess &amp; If well paid will probaljy keep strAfe^tit . It would disturb as little as possible the existing customs &amp; we should not obviously b© t&amp;Xscgtt th© originators of the reform but would seem to be supporting the Shaik in carrying it out. 1 S* Justice* Iwrote you a private letter on this subject some time back,in which I suggested the abolition of the Agency Court &amp; the hearing of all eases in tte ^oint Court. Owing to the extremely bitter relations in Bahrain between Sunnis &amp; shaihs,which attitude has,for their own ends,basn deliberately encouraged by the rulers for years, f sen no possibility of obtaining justice for Shaihs in any purely 'U, . A • native Court. Gross injustice could not occur in the Joint Court &amp; the nmachinery already exists. As a 3et'-off for the P.A. sitting on a court talcing cases between Bahrain subjeats t the Rulers representative would also have a voice in cases between British sublets &amp; British protected subjects,which V' J x might be represented to him as being more digiftified than tho present system whereby he haB no voice in Gdch bases, which owing to the fact that nearly all the trade etc is in foreign hands,form the majority of cases. At present the whe has no Jarisdiction over th© very large foreign community' who live in his territory. It woald be easy to continue our present practice in the Joint Court of deciding cases a s far as possible by the I.P.Code or etc &amp; it would be not difficult to gradually evolve a simple code # After a few yenrs of efemplc f for the benifit both of the public &amp; the Ruler they may have learnt sufficient to start their own courts® In fact this might not unreasonably be promisea them provided they can satisfy Government in the future that they are capable &amp; cooperate with Political Agents to that end. Under the guidance of Political Agents the Court might prove an excellent training ground for the cadets of the ruling family. I would report in detail schemes for the payment of fees, which would be a source of revenue to the Bhaiks &amp; cover working expenses. Jhe work, in the Joint Court since its intridactioa has already done much to educate the people &amp; to introduce some order into business transactions, fhey are beginning to understand elementary Law, It would be necessary to definitely forbid the holding of irregular courts by any odd member of the smiles family. It should be easy to arrange a reasonable prison system^ for persons sentenced by the Court in lieu of the present ^lack hole of Calcutta r of the Amir which is one of the constant causes of complaint bf the Bahrainis^ which the Shaik last year undertoolc to reform,but has failed to do. It would be advantageous in that there would be some Uniformity in senteaees in Criminal Cases. At present in cases in vfjiich the police arrest British protected persons ^ shaiks subjects for one and the same offence^often committed in confederacy,the Bahrain subjects are dealt with by some member incongruous of ths 3haik f s family &amp; the others by the P ,A. with results XSnrb In the event of disagreement between the P.A. &amp; Shaiks representative in any case,appel would lie to the :i : ■ / ;\| ' ' ' ; i, -: Resident, It might be argued that this is not reasonbale in•4^ | 31 the arant of disagre «m «nt regarding a eae© between Bahrain Such a cas« coald however only arise if the P.A. were convinced tl member* s the Shaiks proposed dedision was ga ^ssly anjast f &amp; in such cases / of gross oppression the P fl A 0 already can interefere,if necessary, &amp; in the past it has been sometimes necessary to place victims under British protection, so there v/ould be no innovation. i 3. taxation. If approved the taxes derived under*diving' as proposed above would go a long way to levelling up the dispsirity between shBfca&amp;s ^ sunnis,since the Hakhudas are nearly all sonnis. A onifom date &amp; land tax should be adopted instead of the present haphazard system whereby every shailcling gets what he can. j fo arrive at a proper assessment would not be difficult &amp; could be worked out by the local Governemnt,tm&amp;er advice, but the | first es&amp;entiel would be a survey &amp; the establishment of a I property register•! would suggest something on tha lines of the Tapu system,which works admirably in Iraq^XIx &amp; provides permanent records of titles tc proporty.fhe registration produces revenue which would pay the cost.It might be possible f 1 for the- Ruler to borrow a trained man for say a year at a time from tha Iraq Govt,on adequate pay, iiAfter the preliminary registration,there would not be much work. This refom would do moretthan anything else to stop oppression of Shiahs &amp; would do away with endless litigation.lt would probably be necessary to stipulate that possession for say five years or over would constitute a valid title to property,otherwise we should raise a veritable hornet 1 s nest.Nearly all the property . of the 3haik6S has been looted from Bah rain is in the |M^time of Bhaik Easa.lt would be impossible &amp; undesirable to try to right these old cases now but sufficient if we could put a stop to further exploitation of the shaih sjib f 1ects # A vast number of complicatd disputes which are always going on &amp; cause much of the unrest among the Bahrainis would automatical! come to an end.\i HI mmunmu, Hi *on the Arabian side of the Giilf I think: Bahrain is unique in that there is extensive a valuable landnd property,with no sort of safeguard for owners , Kuwait ,I understand has few gardens etc as also Mascat.Other places are occupied by tribes who have the usual tribal customs to govern their relations as to ownership of property,which customs are probably quite sufficient for the state of civilisation oxis^ting^ All semblance of tribal system has long disappeared in Bahrain,except among the rulers who still endeavour to cling to its desootic aysteM.On the other hand the subjects have of late years advanced very considerable &amp; are in need of elementazy machinery of a Governement to provide security of property &amp; p« rsons.

V The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, Bushi re. Sir I have the honour to report on the present circumstances of the Bahrain Grove rnment. Since your visit to Bahrain last month,a considerable change appears to have taken place in the ^attitude of the Shaiks towards the Agency.They have siught my advice in a variety of matters,and show what appears to be a genuine desire to introduce some reforms. I am informed by persons who have an intimate Icnowledge of their attitude in the past, that this inclination is ^aite unprecedented,and from the records of the Agency,this would appear to be correct* I have long been in the confidence of Shaik Hamad bin iiasa.but recently both he and Shaik Abdulla ( who appears to have mended his ways) have frequently sought my advice and have explained to me the difficulties of Shaik Easa's position which they admit past misrule has brought about &lt;, They have been compelled by recent events to realise,that such tyrannical rule as they have exercised in the past,is,with the spread of democratic ideas,bound to come to an end. The unrest and dis turbances among the indigenous,Shiah population has been fully reported previously. As a result of oppression,they were becoming increasingly restive and the warning delivered.by you to the Ruler,to the effect that he could not expect assistance, in the event of disturbances,was not without effect upon him. Shaiks Hamad and Sbdulla made efforts to pacify the Bahrainis, but unfortunately,junior members of the Shaikly family and his brother Khalid,continued to perform acts of oppression. Parties of Bahrainis were continually coming to the Agency with complaints,and frequently refused to go away,preferring(3^ to pass tha night grouped abound the flagstaff. 3aoh sitaationl V/ere not davoid of difficulty. On one recent occasion,a faflriier act of oppression by one of S aik x ;halid f s sons, caused some fifteen hundred persons to appear at the Agency.They refused to leave and to lay their grievances before the Huler ,as I suggest ed. Since their numbers were being constantly added to by fresh arrivals,I decided to &gt;and for Sbaika Hamad and Abdullate: to endeavour to arrive at a settlement# The ohaiics interviewed a deputation from the crowd f and undertook to instruct ohaik Hhalid to cease interference with liberty of persons and to postpone collection of taxes until further orders. They promised that,in the meantime,they would consider the whole question of taxation,and the administration of justice,and would request Sheik TSasa to make an announirement later. On my recommen dation, the crowd accepted these assurances and dispersed. After this there followed a series of discuss sions at iihich I was asked to advise .It wag pointed out to me that the# Shaiks desired to intrdduce reforms and wished to substitute reasonable and ^ust taxation,for the obnoxious taxes hitherto forced from the Shiahs. I learnt that,apart from the customs,the revenue of the 3haiks, has been derived as follo?/s- 1. Date garden tax. Collected quite arbttrarily,according to the whim end appetite for oppression of the particular shaikling within whose area the garden exists. Practically collodted from shaiafe only. - 2. 1 Raqabie-h 1 literally 'neck tax 1 or poll tax levied on males, at varying rates in aiffarent localities^!t has been collected from shiahs only and is particularly obnoxious to them. 3. Fish tax. Levied from Shiahs only ^t v rying rates. 4*A special tax on Shiahs during Muharram. 5* A variety of taxes col ected in kind from Shiahs only. 6. A pearling tax.This was originally corilectod from all pearling boats,which are mainly owned\ by sunnis.Of late years a large number of th boat owners have ceased paying. A similar tax is collected by the rulers of Kowait,Qatar etc and is the a cknowledged right of the 3ha ik.('&amp;/ Uy advice waa naked aa to tha form .reasonable futttra tasitid^ might taico. After eaveral discussions end sounding of local opinion, scheme for the following taxas vase thought fooexDle - I.

It would seem that if we affordedthls support ve might not unreasonably require the rular to improve his adminis^- tration and to set aside srxrm an annual sum for wriest of public utility.

Daly suggests Shuldham who has already woriaeti under him and knows Arabic. But I regard it as of first importance that the selected Assistant should be officer with legal knowledge especially on admin istrative side. My experience in B-sra leads me to iMasdt suppose that with such a selection Bahrain Court under Bait- rain Order in Council might be entirely self-supporting or so nearly so that a modest contribution from Bahrain Customs would enable Bahrain itself to pay for this particular reform and entail no extra expense to Government for this particular reform. Knowledge of iirabic though desirable ia not essent ial for it will be nowhere quicker learnt than in miscellan eous legal work. Daly anticipates no present difficulty about accomodation. a man of Sidney's stamp would be in - valuable. Daly must have his hands free and time to think. When the Arab side of Bahrain Government is running smoothly post ot Judicial Adviser to Bahrain aovernment might be reduced and Political Agent take over work again, say in five years' time.

In any case the sugges tion that the Political Agent at Bahrein should he given a British Assistant is one which obviously demands more detailed explanation than can be given by telegram.I am therefore to ask that, to enable the Government of India /T to give^this proposal the consideration which it deserves, you will submit it again by letter showing in detail the probable cost of the proposed appointment, whether any portion thereof should in your opinion be met from Bahrein revenues, and how much of the estimated cost is likely to be covered by Court-fees and judicial receipts. I need hardly remind you that any proposals involving an additional charge on Indian revenues require the strongest Justification at the period of general retrenchment. 3. If it is your intention that Bahrein revenues should bear any part of the charge, you will presumably support this proposal by argisnent Justifying it both on grounds of precedent and also of propriety. It is understood,that the main function of the incumbent of the post to be created is to exercise Jurisdiction over foreigners and decide their disputes rdisputes. If so, are you satisfied that the Shaikh can with propriety he called upon to contribute .seeing that hi has ceded jurisdiction ove -1 * foreigners to the repre sentative of the protecting power. On the other hand, if Bahrein revenues hear the cost or any part of it, they would seem to he entitled to receive some portion of the resultant revenue. 4. The Government of India have recognised that the introduction of the reforms at Bahrein may necessitate the provision of some relief from petty cases and routine work for the Political Agent. But they are of opinion that he must be on his guard against heing tempted to interfere too much and too directly in the Shaikh's affairs and to become the actual administrator rather than the adviser and counsellor. Nor are they altogether satisfied that the importance of the Agency to India is sufficient to justify the appointment to it of a second British officer. It was their original intention to consider on the introduction of the reforms the filling of the existing appointment of Indian Assistant (to which no allusion is made in your telegram) and before considering other proposals they desire an expression of your opinion whether this would not suffice. 5. It is perhaps premature at this stage to examine in detail your suggestion that the Assistant Political Agent Bahrein should nonnally look for the reversion of the Bahrein Agency,but on further reflection you will • Ij perhaps agree that any such arrangement is open to obvious objection and is bound to result in administufttive inconvenience. 1 have the honour to be.

Sir, 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yo*jr letter Ho. 1683/1466-E dat^d 14th June 1923 on the subject of the appointment of a British istant to the Political ^gent t Bahrain. In reply to paragraph t 2 of ydor letter cited above 1 venture to clear the ground by stating that 1 realised from the outset that any proposals involviiig an add itional charge on Indian revenues would be hopeless at the present Juncture and say proposal was that Bahrain revenues should take all receipts from court feee and bear the entire cost of the proposed appointment•, further that if, as I hoped would not be the case , any additional expenditure was invol ved , that, surplus expenditure should be met from Bahrain Customs revenues . ^ • The position of Bahrain is&gt; peculiar and at my recent visit there 1 w«s greatly struck by the increased wealth of the islands. Bahrain pearl merchants from Manaaeh, the for eigners ' town, now proceed 'direct to Paris without the inter mediary of any iddleman and have, I am informed, establish ments in P*rls and London where they ^ell their pearls direct to custcarers . If the Political Agent's proposals as to sur vey and settlement go forward , important civil legal questions areare bound to ariae and 1 confidently anticipate ftrofcrlny experience in Iraq that the Bahrain Foreigners • Court under the Bahrain Order in Council would, in good and capable hands I j - be very soon entirely a elf-supporting . 3' It is at present alaost iinposaible for the Polit ical Agent, worried as h* ia with cleaning out the ^ugean stables of the Custoi&amp;s in Bahrain, to give the necessary time that would be involved in preparing an estimate of th« amount of judicial revenues that might be expected if court ^ work vr^s taken up properly by an experienced whole time officer who could devote himself to the proper working of the ! Bahrain Order in Council. 4. Owing to the influx of loreigners which may fairly be presumed to be cue to the satis! oil on they feel at the security affordeo to them under the .resent regime whereby Jurisdiction over foreigners has been ceded to the repres— | entative of the protecting power, the revenues of the al Khalif^h have improved in a manner entirely unprecedented in the past and 1 find no impropriety in calling upon the Shaikh to contttbute, should it unfortunately be necessary, \ towards the cost of giving foreigners a properly constitut ed court where their claims among themselves will receive full consideration .and even-handed J ^tice . 5 • 1 had not forgotten when sending ©y telegram that there was an existing appointment of an Indian Assist at, but I regret to say that I am oonvinced from personal rea sons connected with Shaikh Hamad that an Indian Assistant | will not meet the case. ^here is no doubt that neither nrabs nor Persians are prepared to welcome ^ucn an appoint ment and if for a moment it w*s proposed to hand over to ouch an assistant th« duties of a civil Judge or magistrate, the appointment would not oommand respect. ^ • It is a matter of regret to me to hear that my proposal that the assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, or, as 1 should prefer to call him, the Judicial Adviser to the Bahrain —v &lt;b&gt; !Bahrain GovernDient, should normally look for the rWirsion of the Bahrain Agenty , would be bound to result in adminis trative inoonv^nience . Bahrain ha« a uttered much in the past from want of continuity ol pplioy due to the faot that it is not ea^y to secure incuKbents to the t&gt;ost and that at times, it is true during the war, the post was left vacant. However unimportant the Agency may be to lndi; A f it is the heart of the Persian CJulf and # I regard it as of first im- iortance that, at any rate during the transition period of five year, which 1 have estimated in my telegram Ho. 482 un der consideration, the Political ^gent who must eventually succeed Major Daly should b« an officer thoroughly conver- 0 sant and familiar with the Retails of the administration over foreigners. Armed with this knowledge he could confidently proceed to take over the more delicate duties on which you, fc'ir, lay ao muoa stress in the opening ilzies of paragraph 4 of your letter under re^ly with which 1 beg leave to express my entire concurrence. I trust that the disadvantages of my pro±o«*al will, on ccnsideration, in view of its oompar- atively temporary nature, not be found open to such obvious objection*, and that it will be possible to lend to the Bahrain government the «?ervioee of &amp; fAirly experienced officer of the Politicil Department with the special qual ifications 1 have pressed for. 7 • 1 enclose a statement which gives a very rough estimate of the proposed additional expenditure which the appointment of a judicial Assistant will involve, at any rat-? at t. he beginning. as the work expands - and revenues in crease - it will no doubt be necessary for the officer to add to his establishment. It is impossible to make any forecast now of what may be required later on. The statement shows a rum of Ps 11,000/- on the revenue side as against an estimated expenditure of &amp; 21,360/-. The figure % 11,000/- - receipts from judicial stamps - is taken fromfrom tiyj Political Agent's latest report on the wor&amp;fSg 0 f the Ord^r in Council. Thi^ source of revenue is capable ol much expansion in the future but for the pxatposes of this pre- liiuinary fcudg«t it niciy be aocavted . ifotiriiag had b eea shown as rfoeii-ts rroxu tines , aa 1 have no Information what«v«r to go uton; but it is undeniable that some considerable income may be expected under this head . 1 think tt is very probable that the Court , as it expands , will not only become entirely self-supporting but even show considerable prcfitl On the figure* I have given however it will be necessary for the Court to draw on the Bahrain Customs Receipts to the extent of some &amp; ic ,000/- in order that re ceipts may balance expenditure. Such initial expenditure on equipment (books and furniture) a&amp; may be required will be inconsiderable, and c^n be met from the office allowance of the Political Agent. 1 have the honour to be, Si: Vour bosi , obedient servant, Sd/- S.

Blr, t 1 have th^ honour to address you in amplification of my telegram Ho. 733 dated 30th July 1923. In a letter to me dated July 25th, which is rather too long to be quoted verbatim, Major Daly urged that since the proposal to appoint a Judicial Assistant was first mooted several changes have occurred which tend to modify the situation. The first eaaential of the Reforms is that the Bahrain state finances should be able to bear the expenditure , and at first no diificulty was anticipated in this respect. Recently however the financial position has not been so favourable. Customs receipts have dropped from Bb 90,000/- to below B b 40 ,000/— in the last month , and it appears that this is likely to continue till the end of the pearling season. On the other hand unavoidable and unforeseen expenditure, including large borrowings by Bhaikh Isa and a number of old debts , has had to be faced . Major Daly expresses the hope that it will be possible to pay off these debts by next cold weather, and keep the state solvent. But for the meantime great caution and scrupul ous economy are in his opinion nec^essary . Bhaikh Hamad hae already undertaken to bear the cost of an official to put the Customs in order ; and this it is hoped will bear fruit in the shape ol better receipts . When the Customs have 1}have been refonaec , and the f lnaaoes have a credit &amp;®lance it will then be tii&amp;e to take the next step in the reronus i/rograsiiae, and that he suggests t should be a survey to enabl€ a Departifient for th® registration ot property to be set up. a reform to which Shaikh Hamad attaches greater importanoe than anything else , as without a record of land , boats and I rights , no proposals for equalization of taxation can use- \ fully be initiated . When the registration of property has been carried out, many problems may be expected to arise | which will require expert legal handling. And it is at this stage that Major Daly suggeststhe services of a Judicial^ expert may be enlisted to advise Fhaikh Hamad on how to tackle this problem , how to establish a better court to deal with oases among Bahrain subjects , and so on. f fhis will be, it is anticipated f in 6 or 8 months from new. By then, Shaikh Eamad will probably be only too willing to accept the deputation of a Judicial officer of experience. At present he would, y^Jor Daly thinks, re gard aiw such proposal with disfavour quite apart from the question of its cost. For he has recently established a court of his own in which he takes some pride and interest - which is all to the food - and he would be certain to res ent the introduction of an outsider as an interference with his prerogatives . Major Daly adds that so far as his own work is concerned he does not require the assistance of a Judicial officer at present. The heavy rush of work he had at the beginning in helping Bhaikn Hamad to straighten out the financial tangle is over-, and Judicial work is always light in the pearling season. These various arguments have undoubted weight : and , as I said in my telegram of the 3cth July , 1 am prepared to surrender my opinion and to withdraw my re- commendatirn for the appointment of a British Judicial Assistant. Later on when the time is ripe f Major Daly will .1will no doubt ask tor the loan of a jiaUoial adviser for a short period on behalf of Bhaikh Eaaad . It will then fall to my successor to lay the facts before the Oovernment of India. 1 have the honour to be, Blr, your most obedient servant, Sd/~ S , a.

Sir With reference to the correspondence endin with my letter Ko.622-S, dated lO&gt;th Hovember 1923, regarding the reforms at Bahrain, I have the honour to bring to the notice of Government the material improvements in Manama Tomi which have already been effected by the efforts of the Political &amp;r:ent« 2. As the Government of India ure aware Major Dickson shortly before he relinquished the office of olitical Agent, Bahrain, persuaded Shaikh Isa to consent to the establishment of a Municipal Committee in Manama [&gt; own and the members were actually nominated before he left though there was no time for the Committee to get going, when Major Paly arrived he entered into the matter with zeal and with experience of the best way to push such matters on backward Arab Towns, gained when serving as a Political Officer in Mesopotamia* During the last two and half years very great strides have been Hade- A bo(l|j£ of Itiunicipa 1 Police, who are really very efficient, ail tilings considered, has been raised, trained and equipped with uniform and staves (in lieu of truncheons). T ay preserve order very fairly well. They are of necessity mostly Persiansci) 2 because the local Arabs will not work. The roads been cleaned up and repairedand are kept cle^n, so from being one of the dirtiest town in this part of the world, it is no^? one of the cleanest. Several of the main streets have been widened and corner ..out off and improvements mad® so that motors can pass through them, shop platforms and other obstructions which encroache&lt;|on the road having been removed. One can even drive comfortably in a car through the town from the Agency to the Custom iiouse. Joint Court room etc, or though the town by another road to the Portuguese fort or towards Budaiya. If it * not been for the obstructive attitude of Shaikh Isa a scheme of bringing *»t«r and electric light to the would have been veil under way. a dirty little yillagecfUt huts Just behind the Town near the American Mission has been removed to a good site between the Wireless Station and he Quarantine Station, and the shallow borrow pite breed ing myriad a of mooquitoeB have been drained and arebeing iilled up. The old village was the source of nearly all the epidemics in Bahrain of recent years. Hie new village although named -Zulaabad- (as is one close to BushireTown) is a neat llttle^laoe with good d a t^l% ! and rush houses and wide streets- the transplanted inhabitants having each been given a grant with which the build a new This is a great improvement which has appreciably diminished the number of mosquitoes in the Southern and Eastern parts of Manama. The space between the Agency and the American Mission which was open deaert whein i was at Bahrain (and long after , except for one house belonging to Haji . a ; ejdi pearl merchant, is now covered with fine houses belonging to well-to-do Arabs and Persians with good roads between. Idy recent visits to Bahrain havmj heen rather short and taken up exclusively with interviewsand receiving petitions from Baharnah etc etc I lad Slot till % this occasion had much chance of seeing the outsldb4€ : of the Town and the interior of the Island, On this occasion I hardly recognised the Eastern end of Manama near the Agency. So much for Manama Town. Fired 'by Its example a sort of Municipality has been started at Moharraq. It has done a little towards cleaning up and tidying up the plaace but not much, not having the driving force of the Political Agent i.o urge it on and back it up. As the Government of India are aware che Island of Moharr^q is inhabited almost exclusively by the Khalifah family and Arabs, and is left severely alone by Political Agents as practically none of the Foreign community reside there. Outside Manama Town motor rpads have been made by the Political Agent with the approval of the Shaikh. Sometime ago aftex- a good deal of pressure by the Political Agent and the Municipality and leading men of Manama, ShaiMi Isa agreed to allow roads to be made andiheaded a public subscription to raise funds for this purpose. Aa a result quite good motor roads have been made to Budaiya on North-West corner of the Island, to Ali where the tombs are some 6 or 7 miles out,*1,0 Sakhair near Jefcei Duichan in the centre of the Island about 18 miles out from Manama, not to mention similar roads on the ou!skirts of ihe Town. During my recent visit to Manama Shaikh Hamad asked our party out to lunch at Sakhair, wherejhe has a house, and we went a little way beyond about 20 miles altogether, ahen 1 was at Bahrain I well remember going to Ain ul CHAR with Admiral Slades Oil Committee: in those daysit was quite an undertaking being two days (or to be more exact days) march on donkeys; now it is quite easy to go out and back in a day bjr caa. the leading ghaikhe a all have houses in the neighbourhood of Sakhair and Jebel Bukhan at which they stay in the Spring and Summer andt 4 | I \ v / visit for shooting. They can now go out for shoo'' parties hy car and Shai&amp;h Isa (occasionally) and Shai&amp;h Homed always travel ahoutin an 8 cylinder ^King w • In short the material improvement in sanitation and locomotion in Bahrain is very great; as I informed Shaikh Isa some little time ago I never dreamt that such progress would have been made in wy time. I consider it all reflects great credit on Major Daly without whose energy and determination Bahrain and Manama would undoubtedly have jogged along in the old hopeless fashion quitelunable to overcome the obstruction and passive resistanceof ShaiMi lea and the Al Khalifah.

It not at lirst intendec that the H Lawrence ' should go to B-ashire en route, but the ofiicer in charge of the wirele^ ot tion informed the COEomaiider that tner# were more than 400 me^t;-ages wait ing for despatch and asked whether the 'Laweno^ 1 could take them over to Bus hire ; and the Corumander agreed to do this alter consulting me . nfter the 'Lawrence had left about 5 OO - p.m. on t:» &gt;rc instant, wireless coaafiuni cation to Bus hire wa^ restored to oom^ extent and 1 receiver Govern ment of India clear line telegram Jo. 1339-^ dated 2nd Nov ember f which had been delayed by the atmootpheric^ , and which iii&gt;3 true ted me to deter my departure for another day. On the evening of t^e 4th November (Juneay) Qover^mient of India telegram Jo. 1^66-d giving me instructions w^ recei ved, and I w re^dy to take action. nowever the 'Lawrence 3 co^ld not return till the morning ol the 7th there was no immediate hurry. On the 5^n and oth I had several interviews with sJnaij&amp;h Hamad a'oout the reforms , and the otep2&gt; to be taken against the contumacious tribal heads men, the absconding Dowa^ir etc., etc. At the iiitei^viewe on the 6th Shaikh Abdul la was present as one of Shaikh Hamad* s men had seen one of Abdul la 's men drawing out &amp; 10 # 00C/- ih favour of Abdulla bin Sharideh, one ol Abduila'a moat rascally nenchmen and the latter and 3haiAh fibd ilia's son Mohanmed riad been to Kuwait and Meso potamia about the time the telegram had be^n sent to various f _ _various (rumour saya 1 ouut^en) prot^atlng ^gauiot the retoriLo , there was good ground tor aua|.eoting tiwt iSlaAikh Abdulla, while ostensibly helping Sr^ixth ?i*m*d , w** secretly working against hia. 1 accordingly taxed him with this. He looked extraordinarily uno ok! or table out declared that the bs 10 ,00c/~ drawn for luite another purpose, that his son had been intriguing without his know ledge, that he had only discoverea tnls the day belore f and that he had that morning reported the matter to Shaikh Haisad . The last statement was true (though the others t in my opinion, are very doubt!ul) as 3hai*..i Hamad had told us about it Just b 1 ore dhaikh ^bdulla arrived . ^Itex a good deal ol discussion it was decided that shaikh Abdul la should apologise to iihaikh Hamad for his son's action and tine the latter. as Jnaikh Abdul la's income is supposed to be between ten and twenty thousand rupees a month and his son's between m 1500/- and 2000/~ it w^s eviaent tnat a small fine between father and son would be sutx a farce, so 1 said that the fine must be paid into the Bahrain Govern ment Treasury. After a lot of t^iii and haggling on the part of Jhaikh Abdulia a suitable fine was t ixed and accept ed by Shaikh Abdul la. If his son cannot i.ay the fine Abdul la will i&gt;ay a^xd 1 trust this will be a lesson to them both. 1 expressed to Shaikh abdulla the hope that his son Shaikh Mohammed wauld learn wisdom irom this and re frain irom intrigue, as if he did not, he would get into serio*us trouble aiid pssibly have to oe deported . Af ter this it was arranged that 3haikh Hamad snould produce the next moaning (7th) the signatories to the petition handed in to tne 'Lawrence' on lot November 19^3, among whom were Ahmed bin La he J and Abdul Wahab Sayani , so that my re^ly should be couimunicated to them 'cerbally and the memorandum of it which contained assurances ol the support ol Government to Shaikh Hamad should be given to * the latter . 1 at first thought ct requesting Shaikh kamadEMad to arrest Aimed 'bin L*n&lt;aj aad ^bdul wahato 3aya^i retrained ^on the aivioe of th« Politio^I ^gent, who said trat Ha-ni^ wouiii probably rei ©at aac aiglit even wink at their abscond ing if they ssaeit a rat. It was tortun^te tmt i *iia not do *» o cbo in the evening Shaikh Haaad suggested that these two individuals would be auiiiciently frightened by my *ei.-iy to the other petitioners and ciight be given another ohanoe etc. However 1 refused to adoi$ this course .*nd Shaikh Hamad w^a soon convinced that to do so would lead to end less tr oubie . Cn the mcrikang of the 7th ail the signatories to the petition were brought to tne agency by dhaiichs Hamad an3 xkbdulla except Aiased bin h* he J who had excused himself on account of sore eyes . these alleged sore eyes had ntt prevented nim from rushing about collecting signatures to the petition etc. it w^s evident that this ws a pretext so 1 requested Shaikh Hamad to send men and arrest him and b3Bing him to the agency. fhis was d one ^ and all the sig natories to the petition having been collected in the office with Shaikhs KamaJ and Wodulla, 1 went down accompanied by the political ^gent to see tnem. ^y reply to their pet ition w s r oo d to them in Arabic and I then left. ahaed bin LaheJ and ribdul Wahab Zayani were detained ani sent off to the 'Lawrence' , which had returned that morning , for deportation. lif ter this interview tne Political agent and 1 inter viewed- Shaikhs Hamad and ^bdulla at length about the i)ow- asir tribe. We had aeard from the dnaikna and other sources that about t^o tnir%«s of tne tribe hat* left ^Uuaxya And about one third ikixal remained with Shaikh Is a bin ^hrned Dowari . ; Phe object of the manoeuvre was fairly obvious viz. to Keep a foot in both camps , and to prevent confiscation as much as possible by pretending that most of the property in Budaiya belonged to the section who remained . 'Phis arrangement did not commend itself at allail to me § euid atver a lot ol ai^ou^^ioa it wa^ aeoiueU that Shaikh Hamac shouM coffiaa-^icate with th« jowabir ana oay that Colon#! Kaox 'oaa ^oid tnem that thry might go ii they Wviat«d to, £ubj«ct to penalties # 1 had no otject- ioa to this coiir^e f but that i oouJUl aot agree to a port ion of the tribe going and a portion staying; either they should all return to Budaiya within ten day^ or all leave. II they went however, Shaikh Hatuad would , with the approva of Government, punish thesn by cuil ideating their property, Releasing their divert ixom their ocatracto , and if neoe^- ary , prevent theffi iroia diving. as dhaiKh Haiaad seemed very nervous about acting hiauelf 1 gave him a letter promising him support in taking the action mentioneu against the jowa^ir. 1 will new ret•r to the iuesticn of the actual reforms which I nave aiac^i^eu with the Political ^gent a*id to aome extent with Shaikhs Hamad and ^bduila. I think the foil- owing reforma are neceaaary and should oe introduced with a^ little delay a« ^o^^ible.

Mr. power devoted himself to introducing a proper system ol aocounts ana a regular system of enforcing payment ol dues. Qader arrangements the old regime certain merchants had private Skm&amp;MM with the Director of Customs under which they were permittea to pay tneir duty once or twice a year when it suited tnem.

This very sat- i^l actory t and reflects great credit on Mr. Bo^er. Mr. Bower propoaeb to arrange for the completion of the ena of the Cmtojaa Jetty, and of the light railway on it, and f0£ the erection of 3heda on the middle ol}4t• Ei^ work at Bahrain will shortly be finished , and will have been of the greatest uae to the finances of the Bahrain dtate. The success ol Mr ♦ Bower's efforts have convinced Shaikhs Hamad and Abdul la ol the necessity to have a Euro pean jirector , and in consultation ^ith them and the pol itical Agent, Mr. Bower oas aravm up a aoheme for a iiuuro- pean Director , # the terma ajge good - pay to commence at fa 1000/— per mens em and rise by annual increments of j * pO/- to x€ 2000/- if the new Director ^rovea a success and wiahea to btay. provision is made lor a provident lund and the arrangements for leave closely approximate to tne regulat ions under the r una amenta 1 Rules. Mr. Bower thinka it will be impossible to get an Indian Customs olficial to take up the Job even if one could be spared , which seems unliKely, but ne says that tne work is very simple, there valuations or being only a 1lat ad valorem rate and no complicated/ass essments , anu taat no guatoms experience is necessary . The essential lualif icatioxis are integrity, energy and a knowledge of accounts . sphere should be no diff iculty in engaging a suitable man on the terms offered and # as , in my opinion, it is necessary to obtain a new Director De- fore Mri Bower goes or at all evexits as soon alter his departure as possible to avoid an interregnum. 1 propose to8 ^ to begla making inquiries at ouoe. (2) Small lore# ot l,evi&lt;8a . fner* can be no doubt tiiat a 5mall L^vy Force an essential to the proper governmant ot Baiaraln. Probably 200 or 250/would be a suitable number, but having regard to the revenues ot Bahrain the Political Agent thinks , and 1 concur, that IOC will suffice in the 1 irat instance. Local xO'ab material quite unsuitable , and it would not be expedient to employ Persians aa being objectionable to the Arabs. 1 consider therefore tnat it would be best to employ Balucnia , numbers of whom are employed round the Gull in various capacities and to whom the Arabs are quite accustomed . In a recent report Mr. wingate stated that he proposed to reduce the Muscat Levies by 100 men/ per haps therefore a auificient number of Arabic speaking trained Balucnis to i orm a nucleus ior the new force could be obtained from Muscat. Bad such a lorce existed the recent Jejd - Persian riots could have been nipped in the bua, Lt they rmd taicen place , whicn seems -unlikely if there had been a force in being to preserve ora&amp;r; furthar the jo'was ir could have been prevented irom leaving Bahrain , and trioal headmen would not have a area *#o defy ^naikh Eamad . in short the Ruling Shaikh would never have been so impotent and afraid of the ounni tribes had he had a small force at his comm and » ^hai ah Hamad is naturally most anxious to have such a force . But it is essential that the force should be well disciplined and loyal; a badly organized rabble would be a positive danger as it would even in such a state be strong er than anything which could be mobilized against it, and therefore might be used by its own oil leers or malcontents to overtlirow the Bahrain Government. To ensure disci pline it would , in my opinion, be necessary to engage a British oilicer, or ex-olfleer , to raise it and command it ■Vithto resemble ualng a mmm#r to crack an egg, &amp;ad be- sld^ to incur unnecessary expendiVar#. But I see no hei* for it . Ho ioodtl men appear to hav*? any aptitude or inclination ror iLiii^ry work, apart tro&amp; knowledge or energy • an Indian oiticer #ould probably be capable oi raisiuig ana training such a amail force * but such an appointment would be intensely unpopular and would be resented by ail ola^&amp;es . In the oircumstanoes 1 think a British oit leer must be employed; the services of one could doubtlera be obtained l or ^onder m 1000/- P^ mens em inclusive . It is proposed that the pay at the new Oua- toms Director ahould at^ab^ on '&amp; 1000/-, so the cost ot the^e two olTicers would not at flrat exceed that of Mr. power whose emoluments are rs 2000/- per mensem, an expenditure which the Bahrain &amp;x? te finds ao dilliculty in making. soon a^ the receipts and expenditure ot trie state can tm'&amp;B be more or leas accurately estimated , I will suJbm 11 pro— poaala lor the establishment ol a small Levy Corps . It is very necessary trat the ownership ol land in Bahrain should be registered and a proper record of rights made out. 1 am afraid tbat it is impossible to find any local official with sufficient Knowledge and integrity to do this work. 1 would suggest therefore the deputation of a young olficer from India ac-iuainted with survey and settlement worn ; if he had a working knowledge of Arabic this would be oi great assistance to him and would enable him to deal with the work much more accurately and exped itiously . II the Governmeat oi India approve of this proposal in principle 1 will submit a scheme with as much detail as 1 can give, but 1 fear 1 have not cufficieat knowledge of the subject to give any detailed estimate of the cost. jx great deal ol tne land neld by the *4! iCnal—• ifa lamily and well to do Sunnia has undoubtedly been filchedjakiiWato or ^ earl lag aastere , wno Wider rioting ooaditloaa rxave mavter^ absolutely their own way .

The first essential is that the Uakhuias should Keep accurate ^nd intelligible accounts, tae second is taat each diver should be given a copythird that the M 3alilmh w (pear 1 lag usage) Ooiart should b® caa^osed 01 itea 01 position integrity o^pabl# of 'under standing such accounts * fhere does not ^t first a^e&amp;r to be any difficulty About settling these ^oints , but the matter is complicated by the fact that a iarg^ proportion of the Jakhudas oi Bahrain - ^uite two thirds we estLmate - are absolutely illiterate and ialte Incapable of kee|.ing intelligible account, and in addition men of integrity who are acquainted with pearling usages to sit on the Balifah Court are very lew and fai? between- T'ne political jtgent is ol opinion that the best way to get over these two difficulties is to create a small Pearling Depart ment at the Bahrain Government which will supervise the ind'astry generally and become particularly active tor about one month before the pearling season commenced - say from 2ist March to the end of April - and ag=»in for about one month alter - 3«y from the 21st September to the end of October. During these periods the Saltish Coaart would sit permanently and t .e :tfa*aiudas would be s-ummoneu in turn to appear with their divers and haulers. During t ^ per iod beiore the season the Jaknucas would prove to the sat is faction of the Department the amount paid on account of advances and 1 ood during tne of! season to eacn civer, and such smount^ would be entered by a clerk in the naKnuda's accounts with a copy in the diver's booK; the advance far the season wcuid be paid over to the diver in t :&amp; depart mental office and similarly entered by the clerk in the Hakhuda'a and diver's book. In the event of a dispute the ilakhuda and diver conoern&lt;?d would proceed before the Salifan Court and have the amount adjusted . In the ^erio.* at the end of the season the Jakhudas with their divers would be summoned in the same way. Tne Hakhudas would prove to the satisfaction ol the Department the net preceeds ol tne season for the boat and at - te the divers* aiid haulers 1fQV iaauiero * Jiiares , which shared would be paid over Xp %$ £ dtv&amp;TQ aad haulers ( le&amp;s adv - ao^a ev«io'as iy ^ald thwn) in the aepartmeatal ottioe , detaila at the transaction entered in the ^aknuaa 1 s acccont -anid th# main tacts in the diver's book. In the event of the divert . hare being less than the previous debt to the ^akhuda the amouiit due to him on hi a share should be entered in hi a book and the debit balance shown. Ilatch'^dae and divera r^viing disputes would proceed before the Salifa .Court and have them adjui- Icated . For making this arra.igei&amp;^nt the Bahrain Govern ment might legitimately tax ijakhudaa and divers a amail percentage (say l&gt;t) on their ae-taon's gains or on the amount taid to the divers 1 this of course apart from the general tax on each ^.e^rling boat which 1 consider should be levied and the amount Qi which is being considered . frds arr angement woulo put the whole bushineaa on a sound tooting, but it entails a good de 1 ot hard work and is therefore not suited to Bahrain; tie 4 dk hud as would bitterly resent it as introducing too much publicity into their all airs an* reducing their chances of peculation and swindling. Be fore endorsing and finally submitting this scheme to 1 propose to make enquiries into tne number of boats , Hakhud- as and divers with a view to seeing whether the proposal is feasible: it is possible that the numbers of tne laot ment ioned category are so large that a small department could the not deal with them ix^time. 1 think nowever sosaething on these 1 ines will have to be introduced . \6; Nuece s a ion - po ens'ore the success of the rel orm^ it is essential that early steps should be taken to train an enligntened successor to Shaikh Hamad. The latter's eldest son Selman has all the worst qualities cl the a! Knalifa family. He is totally uneoucated , vaili, lazy, and inclined to oppress and tyrannize over anyone who is powerless to resist, oelman is absolutely unfit to succeed his father as ruler. ItIt is hardly mo*aa*Ty to juid that Shaikh BaznAd ^ brother ^toauiidb t though the moat capable ol th# Knalifa is 4uit uaciuitcible to succeed his bi?oth^r. The politic*! Ageat considers that .one ol the younger 3oaa named yobarak aged about twelve ia the attest of Shaikh Eii&amp;ad *&amp; boos and that he would reyay eduo^tlon. Major Daly ai«io thinks that it would be very useful to the Bahrain State if his two younger brothers accompanied him. Major Daly suggests that Mobarak and his two younger brothers abouLi be provided with a tutor ^nd sent to one ot th# Chiefs 1 Colleger in India. fhe son of Eia Eighneaa the Sultan ot Muscat, dayyed daeed t ib , aa the government ol India are aware , now at the Mayo Collete . 1 agree with the polit ical .agent that it would be a good thing to arrange 1 or the education of Shaikh Hamad *s three youngest sons and would enquire whether Government would be prepared to authorize s&gt;e to jress- Shaikh Hamad to send Uobarak ^nd hln two younger brothers , or at least one ol them , to Coiiege . It would, we think, be well worth while for the Bahrain dtate to pay for their education and as it is character rather than book learning which we desire them to acquire, the beait results t we are sure , would accrue il an athletic well bred young officer could be selected a^ their tutor. Shaikh Hamad vaguely in theory desires hi* oon^ to be educatec f but in practice considerable t-reosure will have to be exerted to make him come ut to the scratch, V7i i^Mt^lion_ol a^^ciaiSys tem In Bahrain, and t .•# introd uction of some simple Cr imin al and Civil Codes . at present Judicial bus Janes&lt;3 m at Bahrain is conducted as follows (a) B ahrain subJect a .

Hi a success or, who will be, in all probability, better educated and E »ore enlightened would feel thia is ore . in the circum stances it would aeesu advisable that soim Code of Law should be introduced , and JnaUth Ha^ad himself agreed to this. ^ the India penal Law-* and Cilril Lawa are en forced in the political agent's Court ani used as a guide in the Joint Court the Indian Criminal and Civil Codes or a simplified form of theiu , it such exiats , would seem beat; presumably ^abic translations have been made 1 or use in aden and sanaibar.

But 1 oee no alternative; no upright , puolic spirited , educated men, so 1 ~r as 1 am aware, exist in Bahrain. I have always si ted that the great difficulty in introducing reforms into Bahrain is that there is no one either in tne ruling family or among tne notables capable ot carrying them out. 1 therefore ^m ol opinion that it we «o not appoint British otficiais to supervise tne reforms they can never be successfully introduced .

We could transfer many more cases to the Shara ^ the Majlis A1 Urfi f but the latter are kept full up ^ they are mercahnts &amp; cannot afford the time to sit more than once a week for a few hours &amp; v@ keep the Share hard at it. The urgent need is for another court on the same lines which would reliwe both Hmad &amp; myself.Wo have discussed the matter fully &amp; are agreed t |f that there is no member of the family who could be trusted at present or has sufficient knowledge,to sit in court without advice &amp; our suggestion is that a young member of the family who has just been appointed Amir of Manamfc&amp;,&amp; who attends our courts for instruction,shotiia form the second court with t Britifeh Officer. The latter would combine with this duty that of Commandant of the Levies &amp; would if necessary &amp; he can manage it,supervise the Hevenue Department (Otherwise it is proposed the Director of Customs should do this) We propose that this court ,which should be designated in Arabic •Th® Small Court' should h vete t?i]ce all cases within tho p@v©rs of a secsnd el? 8%^%^lstrat®, i that it Bh@uld sit three tr faar cteys a v/eek as my b« necessary. ?here should be right of appeal on payment of appeal fees,to the Xprge C@art f which will continue to consist of Hanad &amp; the PpA. wording on the lines hitherto In force &amp; which would have the powers already possessed by the P.A. of 1st CI gss Magistsrste &amp; Sessions Judge. Hamad would ba guided by those po ers himself in tsking his own cases. It is further proposed that certain classes of casos, should for the time being be reserved for the 'I^rg© Court* namely Criminal Cases betwen iunnis &amp; Shaiaks &amp; Cases between 3unni Garden owners ^ thair shiah farmers,which owing to the religious feeling &amp; political aspect require careful handling. In estimating the pay of a ^ritish Commandant of Levies in the Budget I have purpo ,®ly allowed for the dual capacity. I would urge that a Young Political officer who has just done training might be appointed to this post,which would be regarded ss f Foreign Service* He might be given his pay in the Political plus an allowance for Commandant of Levies. He would undoubtedly be a good investment fot the Bahrain Government &amp; would earn most of his pay in court fees. 5?he prosent system as regards fees,is that in cases between Bahrain subjects which Hamad tskes the fees go to the Bahrain Government, in Joint cas^ s they are divided, &amp; in cases between Britsh subjects taken by the Pp-^p. they are creditei to aovernment. I would suggest that this system continue as regard the r Large Court 1 but I think it would be right as regards the small ^ourt for all fees to go to the Bahrain Grovernment,since they would be paying the British Officer. Or another,but more c omplicated way would be for Govt, to pay half the salary of the officer (except the Commandants allow« ance which would be paid wholly by Bahrain) &amp; Bahrain the other hgdb- half,but this would be complicated further as regards pension contribution.! think that he should be wholly paid by the Bahrain Grevernment &amp; that they should h've the feer, earned in his court, even if recoverd from Britsh protected parsons &amp; then they would /' j be in position te ask his help in other small matters as well. •^ch an officer could be housed without trouble^Uhe new quarters f designed for the Customs Director,which is to be started almostr fh« experience a yoang officer wouia gain weuld be very valuable te hi him,^ 5 without in any way tieing the h^nds ef Gevernment, it is not iaptssible that the local IcnowledgQ he would acquire might make it very convenient for him to eventually become PpAp &amp; continuity of Policy for ^ few years *ftervthe initaltion of the reforms is very desirable• I need hardly ssy that I consider Shulfttiiniwould be the ide^l choice.

I thinfe the aovernment of India will agree that the Bahrain dtate appears to be pleasingly solvent - a distinction among ^irab Principalities in this part of the world . If so however , it is entirely due to the efforts Of Major Daly and Mr . Bower , as prior to June 1923 the Shaikh was living from hand to mouth, writing drafts on the Custcms , getting into debt with them etc. cjuite in f the approved style for such principalities. 3.

Bower in reorganising the Cus toms of Bahrain «nd helping the Political Agent to evolve order in the general finances of the principality fran the absolute chaos into which they had fallen during the faineant rule of Shaikh Isa. It is a great pity that neither Bin 'aud nor Shaikh of Kuwait wish to get the itfejd - Kuwait Customs dispute settled anu that tie Shaikh of Kuwait does not even want his CustOi«s put on a aounu basi&amp;. 4. 1 have dealt with all the principal points raised in Foreign and political ijet cirtmen t telegram 1688-3 dated 8th December 1923 and in the Political agent's letter en- clos^d^ in my express letter i ; q . 712-3 dai.ed 21st December i 1923 - a copy of which is attached for ready reference - and 1 do not consider it necessary to go into them again.

However with the example of Muscat before my(ii) P/ Viv) Day eyes ( not to mention the previous state of Bahrain » Customs which w^s certainly better run by the Hindus than it would have been by local ^rabs) 1 consider it essential to have an Bngllshman in charge at any rate far some yesrs until everything has been stereotyped t and a checK can be kept on receipts and expenditme by an outsider simply from the average of previous years. in addition, as pointed out by the Political Agent f Bahrain , Shaikh Hamad piefers to have an English Director, cr^ 100 levies to be enlisted and trained by Captain alban a^ commande^ by the 2nd of th&amp; native officers with the Muscat Levy Corps , under the supervision of the ^st istc^nt political ^ent.

I send you herewith copies of a D.O. letter which I have received from Latimer on the subject of the Bahrain reforms, and my reply. It is clear that the Government of India, having launched the 'Reforms 11 , are willing to man the ship, steer her a safe course and take measure to prevent her sinking. But they are not out to build a fleet I Prom this I mean to convey that.reasonable measures to secure the even progress of the reforms towards a moderately conceived objective are likely to meet with the full sympathy of the Government of India. But anything beyond this, anything in the nature of a new departure, involving commitments for the Government of India, is sure to meet with opposition. Shaikh Hamad, I take it, at present holds all the rein^s of Government in his own hand. Is there a likelihood of his delegating any powers in the near future to a competent Cabinet of indigenous Ministers, or even to one Vazir.? Have you any observations to make regarding the reforms already introduced and those contemplated ? -I I 4 ^ajor C. K. Daly, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.D .O. Ho. 484-S. The Residency, Bushire, 24th August 192 My dear Latimer, lease refer to your D.O. letter Ko. 36-X, dated the 25th July 1924, in whioh you suggest that we may be treating Bahrain too much on the lines of an Indian Native State.and warn me that we must not proceed further or faster than we can carry the Shaikh whole-heartedly with us. I will bear this in mind and will look into matters carefully when I visit Bahrain - probably next October. Shaikh Hamad, as you know, paid me a brief visit last month, when he spontaneously spoke of his great trust in and love and admiration tor Daly. I obtained the impress- -ion at our interview that he whole-heartedly approves of the four chief reforms whioh are under weigh, i.e. in the Customs Administration, the Municipal Sanitation, the Revenue Settle- -ment which will so much ameliorate the lot of the Shia cultivatirs, and the Pearling which will emancipate so many divers, including a majority of negroes, whose lives at present are harder than those of slaves. I expect that you are receiving instalments of the new edition of the Foreign Office 'Consular Instructions'. We recently received Chapter 7TII and in its Annex I notice that Bahrain is now included in class 'B. British Protected States' along with the Federated iSalay States, Principal Native States of India, Nopal and Hadramaut. There is a vast difference in the degree of civilization between the most and the least enlightened of these States !, Yours sincerely, timer, Esq., ^d/- F, B.

I think th.« Govermnnet of India have been inclined to regard as Reforms' a good many matters which in no way come under that : heading.In the first place the matter which created a storm was the reijioTal of Shaik -Easa from the active conduct of affairs &lt;&amp; the opposition put up 'by the Hakhuda class who had had everything thei own way in the past &amp; feared that they would have to com® into line under the new regime. The decision to remove Shaik 33asa was taken 'by Govt.as a necessary paving of the way to the 'Reforms 1 . The reforms contemplated we»e~ (1) The setting up of an elementary tribunal where subjects of Bahrain could get a reasonable measure of justice. (2) Insistance on a reasonably fair deal for divers vis-a-vis Nakhudas - that is to say that the existing system should be fair ly carried out-no innovations were contemplated. (3) A survey to enable a record of rights in property to be com piled to put a stop to the wholesale looting of the property of Shaihs which has gone on in the past 8c to stop the incessant disputes as to boundaries,one of the main causes of bitterness between the Sh4ahs &amp; the ruling Sunni class* The above were suggested by us as necessities &amp; real ily agreed to by Shaik Hsmad &amp; at every stage have his full support. In addition the Shaik (Hamad) himself asked to be allowed to maintain- (4) The Levies* to support his prestige &amp; enable him to exert some authority.lt was obvious that without some force he could do nothing to stop disturbances &amp; we were always obliged to ask for a ship whenever a 'row 1 occurred.The Levies when trained sfea should obviate the necessity for this. In your letter to Mr Latimer you mentioned 'Sanitation'.This was not however part of the 'Reforms'.A Municipality was started before the 'Reforms ' were thought of, but as Shaik Easa always 91'- thwEtted the efforts of the Municipality progress was slow.Since The Political Agency Bahrain. 3I/Q/24.Shaik Hamad took chasg® progrts# in evtry di: work ha« 'bten rapid.H« is hims«lf Prtsident tntir® managemont of affairs is v«Bttd in til P # A. attends meetings ex officio &amp; the menbe m apart from helping whexoro asked to do so,he &gt; management So Shaik Hamad himself takes no de concurrence of the majority of the members. * 1 'by the Municipality are noM part of the f Bef&lt; To revert to the actual 'reforras* i (!)

A considerable number of such cases have been disposed of in the last year .Possibly a few more will come to light when the 'record 1 takes piace but not many are anticipated.Nobody is now afraid to claim his rights &amp; those who had claims have not been slow to avtil themselves of the Court, (4) The Levies are in being, I know of no other 'reforms 1 that are contemplated. Ordinary improve ments such as the water scheme improvement of roads t building a sea- frontvetc etc are the normal developements of the state.They are naturally given prominence because under Shaik Easa's rule nothing was done at all,but they are not Reforms'initiated by us, they are improvements effected by Hamad on which he is very keen.Surely it is not our policy to stop him improving his state if he wishes to? He is particularly anxious to make a 'show 1 to prove to the public that his conduct of affairs is to their benifit. So far from the Government of India being further 'committed everything tends to lessen their commitments. Presumably they do not regard the Shaiks request for assistance in finding a subAsst. Surgeo as a commltnsut? If so it was only necessary to decline &amp; he would have made his own arrangements,but we thought a trained man selected by the Mediacl authorities for the post would be more useful. The other possibl® 'comitments' are the O.C.Levies &amp; the Levt equipment So the A.P.A. The first two are e ntirely paid for by the Bahrain State.All that Grovernmmnt has done was to find the office such assistance has already been afforded Muscat &amp; is ,1 believe, generally afforded by Governmnet to States under her protedtion or in treaty relation with her. The appointment of an A.P.A.is to fiome slight extent a 'commitment' but an unavoidable one. Even before the reforms case wor had increased so much that Govermamt had recognised the necessity for an Indian Assifefcaat.The post remained vacant during the thr®«y«p,r« I 3mv« 'b«tn her« on th* tcor# of •conoinyj'but if I may venture to •ay so,it is solely due to the fact that I happen to know arabib &amp; Persian &amp; can consequently dispose of case work fairly quickly Sb ^ dispense with an Interpreter which mad® it possible for me to carry on without an Assistant. Statistics shew that case worl* is steadily in creasing. Perhaps this is unfortunate but it at least shews that the court is fulfilling a want,A: in Court fees alone the expense of an Assistant is easily covered .As you know,Indians are not at all pop- -ular here &amp; there were many reasons why it was considered desirable that the Assistant should be a* British Offi^ iit That Bahrain is gradually becoming mora civilised may or may not ,8uit usjbut I fail to see how we can stop it.Every year more people from here go to Europe in the pearl trade &amp; coma back somewhat enlightened,&amp; a number of educated people now come her© frequently fromm India.It is not possible therefore that ideas should remain fix- ed. It was precisely because Shaik Easa refused to move alittl® with the times,while his subjects were advancing,that zza&amp;sjsst gave rise to necessity for a more enlightened Ruler. I think the Government of India may rest assured that no body wnats to intriduce any more 1 reforms f or to commit them in any my further .Improvements in the Administration will howe¥« gradually take place unless we take it upon uurselvee to forbid Hssmad to carry out his Ideas.It seems to me that once the ♦Record of rights * is are compiMAd &amp; the diving books brought into use &amp; tho simple rules are • got out for the Court the ^iiorms* may be allowed to di® a natural death &amp; that we should not drag in every small improvement in the administratiQn of the state &amp; label it as a •^eform'.t pivwm'n&amp; . no. 86^S.

BOTUIH mfoms. sir, n I have the honour to state that on my recent visit t&lt; Bahrain 1 found things considerably improved. shaikh Xsa was on better term© with his son Hamad, who has a oonsiderahle respect for hi© father and has a great desire to stand well with him. Shaikh Isa now draws his pension - indeed he is asking for more. He called on me, and instead of maintaini: a taciturn aloofness, talked freely, and on my return call volunteered information of his own accord. He has steadily improved in his relations with the Political Agent. On say first visit to Bahrain in the beginning of February I found things had already improved, but a possible cause of trouble existing in the bad relations between Shaikh Hamad and the Shi a qazi. Shaikh Khallaf. I explained to the latter that it was obvious he could not continue in the place if he and the de facto Shaikh of the Islands were at loggerheads, and later both he and ShaJ Hamad stated that as far as they were concerned they were on 1 best of terms, Shaikh Hamad pretending that the only cause of trouble was the dislike of the ••hias for their Q.as&amp;i, who was dishonest.In actual fact they ^ere each euspicioua of the other and ready to take up any quarrel or intrigue aga-inut the other. On my arrival on my second visit the Shaikh expressed a desire to see me about two laatxers. Vhe first was the Dowasir tribe affair, on whicli I have reported separately, the second. Bhaikh Khallaf. He produced a petition, with apparently hundreds of signatures, in which the t&gt;hia community protested against the rapacity and injustice of their q&amp;zi and requested that a second Qazi, whom they named, should also have cases referred to him. Shaikh Hamad again suggested that he himself was on the best of terms with Shaikh Khallaf but there was no doubt that there was much feeling against him, and ha asked me to get Shaikh Khallaf removed. Shaikh Khallaf was one of the biggest supporters of Major Daly, and thus while Hhaikh Hamad desired me to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him by getting rid of the qassi, my doing so would give colour to a theory which has been suggest ed in places that whatever Major Daly did was wrong and that it is a safe game to play to go against his supporters. Any such suggestion both the Political Agent and I were anxious to negative. Accordingly X sent for Shaikh Khallaf and told him that he must get on good terms with Shaikh Hamad and that until circumstances w$re better 1 would strongly advis# him to go on a pilgrimage himself. Major Barrett had told me that Shaikh Khallaf, confident that Bhaikh Hamad could not &lt; 0 without him, had once stated to him as one of the solutions of the situation that he would go on a pilgrimage to Kerbala. I recalled this statement to him and suggested it was the best thing he could do. at the same time maintaining good relations with Shaikh Hamad. He finally agreed to do this and I again saw Bhaikh Hamad, told him of the solution and instructedInstructed him to ahow Shaikh iCh&amp;XXaf special honour and friend- -ship until he left. To this he agreed. It ie now determined that after Hamaaan Shaikh Khailaf will leave of hitt own accord and In all honour, and will atop away some time. I trust that this will remove all cause of friction. Shaikh Khallaf is bound to intrigue but Major Barrett does not now anticipate that his following is so great as to causft trouble« The CjriZi is a man of character but is now getting old. Of his venality there is, I fear, little doubt, and it is not the first time he has had to leave for similar reasons. His successor is reported to be a religious man who takes little money. I am, 1 fear, sceptical regarding the honesty of r&gt;hiM. mullahs as I have yet to meet an honest one, but he appears to be good of his kind though somewhat fanatical, and to respect the property of widows and orphans. He is at any rate the choice of his sect. A complication has been that the Agency Interpreter was the son-in-law of the Q&amp;zi, an undesirable state of affairs. From the time that Shaikh Hamad was known to be in opposition to his father-in-law, open complaints of bribe-taking have been brought against out Interpreter. Regarding these I will not at present express an opinion, but numerous persons have come forward to prove sums given by them and their friends or taken by the Interpreter as commission, sums amounting probably to some lakhs of rupees over the past few years. His pay is B. 150/- per mensem. I had already appointed a new man temporarily and the matter Is under investigation. Things in general are however considerably better. Major Barrett sees no immediate reason to anticipate any further serious trouble, and from my enquiries I endorse his opinion. That(HS) ) 'hat difficulties will ooour, that the situation will continue to need careful handling toy the Political Agent ie certain, but the intrigues in the name of Shaikh lea and perhaps those of Chaiich Atodulla, Shaikh Hamad 's brother, appear to exist no longer. Ehaikh Abdulla's jealousy of Shaikh Hamad's son, Salman, will perhaps give the Political Agent some thought in the future but at present there is nothing definite or tang- -ible to mention, and X trust that 1 am not giving an unduly optimistic report in saying that X see no cause at present for further anxiety.

British administration in the Bahrain State# Sir, With reference to Sir Frederick Johnston's letter Ho.S-S dated the 19th January 1929! I asa directed to say that the introduction of reforms in Bahrain was originally intended only to remove the worst features of Arab misrule# AS matters stand now? however, it would seem that the process h&amp;s overrun its original limited objective• there are in Bahrain to-day a British Mnanoial Adviser, a British Police Officer, and a British Customs Officer; that is^ actually more British administration than in an ordinary Indian Btate f even thc.n (for instance) in Kalat, though Falat is s frontier State, in which imperial considerations dictate a comparatively marked degree of direct interference• 2. There is an evident danger that with this example before their eyes the minds of the smaller Arab rulers jaay te turned increasingly in the direction of Xbn Saud» 3$ the greatest Arabian figure. Their fear of Wahabi absorption »y be less than their fear of losing their local and Arab individuality in exchange for an uncongenial western regime, however efficient and profitable that regime may be. 3. I am to request you to examine in this light the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken? and to submit your concrete proposals for the Initiation of a revised policy# I have the honour to be, Sir. lour most obedient servant, Sd/- J.G.Aches on, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India*note on Reforme in Bahrain l^y Sir JJenys Jiray, K.C.IJS,, C «S • X. g C.B.]!:,. i.G.S., foreign be ere tary to the Government of ^ndia in the foreign and jfolitical Deimrtment (on Touri® Bahrain has obviously 'become the keystone of our position in the Gulf* It is likely to gain rather iose importance in this respect quite apart from its commanding position on any air route along the Arab littoral. it is unthinkable that we should abdicate from our position as the paramount protecting power. The local arguments in favour of an apen and definite declaration that Bahrain is a British protectorate are strong. 3, If, however, wider policy does not permit of such a declaration our position is impregnable anyhow. It is based on Treaties which are at once adequate and public. They give us our essentials — the control of foreign affairs and of foreigners. From these essentials flow inevitably certain rights and indeed duties to inter fere in internal affairs. Our present interference ^oes doubtless beyong what flows inevitably from our Treaties. But no Treaty could adequately cover it unless it were a Treaty extinguishing the Shaikh's severeigntjji to a degree less than that possessed toy an Indian Chief. 4, One of the great difficulties in the.problem is the fact that the reforms we have introduced and the development schemes we have initiated are very fine performances in themselves and of great benefit to Bahrain. It is unthinkable that we should undo our fine work. nevertheless it is agreed on all hands, now thatthat we have taken stock of the situation, that matters should 'be given a somewhat different turn or the Arab facade will fall and we shall be l|ft with a British island pure and simple. 5, The result would be — (a) a needless addition to our commitments; (b) an actual loss of power, for through the Shaikh we can do much (e.g. keep Germans out, as we did recentlyj which we could not do on our own; and (c) we should present an awful warning to Arab Shaikhs of the consequences of admitting British inter ference, and help to set up i5in Saud in their eyes as the one possible champion of Arab ways against British encroachments. 6. Our aim should be not British efficiency, for with this as our goal we could stop no wherc j but to demon strate that an Arab State can advance on western lines under British protection and yet retain its Arab character. 7, Hence we must endeavour to take out the British high-lights from the picture and bring the Arab rule of the Shaikh more to the foreground. 8. British interference is esijecially over-advertised in the police, a particularly fine body of men, all Punjabi Muhammadans, with uniform and drill of an mdian regiment. They suggest at once foreign rule, and make it look as if &amp; the present state of Bahrain depends for its security on Indian bayonets alone. {A striking contrast in afforded by the appearance of the A. if. U. G. Persian policemen in the British Settlement ar Abadan.) in this, as in all matters, we should cling to essentials and discard the trimmings. We might for instance, drop the uniform or at any rate simplify it; replace some of the .Punjabis gradually by some element less foreign (e.g. Arabs from the Yemen) keeping a diminishing number of .funjabis as a nucleus. mneltifnnnucleus. 9. We should aim at cutting #ovin the three .British adrainistrators gradually to one. xhe policeman sjjiould probably be the first to gp , to be followed in course of time by the Customs Superintendent. .but if Mr helgrave is eventually to control police and customs he must of course be given subordinates (possibly Arab or Egyptian; to help him and he must be relieved also of some of his present executive work. Kelief might perhaps be given at once in judicial matters. if he cannot be relieved of judicial work altogether his work might be confined either to big cases or appellate wotk* Speaking generally the British administrator's work should tend to become more and more advisory and supervisory. 10. His aim, like our aim generally, should be to bring the Arab rule of the Shaikh more and more into the foreground. it is no doubt very difficult to make the amiable Hamad rule, but it is better that he should tule and make mistakes than that we should mile and make no mistakes at allr Experience apparently shows that the more power within reason that is given to the far more energetic and influential Abdulla the straighter he runs and the smoother the administration. if it is at all in consonance with Arab ways it would seem worth while to give a trial to a council with Hamad as .president, and Abdulla and Mr Belgrave and a third Arab as members. This might tend to instil some resolution into Hamad's flmle and at the same time give Abdulla a more definite participation in it. SD/ DEHYS J3KAX. Mohammerah, 6th November 1927. sCOKFIDEHTIAL.

Political Agent, Bahrein* The Secretary to the Horn'hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Bushire. S^r, I have the honour to refer to your letter Ho. I98-S dated the 5th June 1929, forwarding letter Ho. F-I64-M/29 dated the 28/5/29 from the Government of India, asking for my considered opinion as to how far it is possible to retrace the steps taken since the mx reforms cominenced, and to submit the following report. . 2* For convenience these steps have been termed the^eformsi but as words that mean one thing in the Persian Gulf have anothej 2000 miles away, I will first of all summarise the events that ■ led up to them, then describe exactly what reforms were intended/ how far they have been carried out, and how far it is practical i|j| or politicmto go back on them, such a retrogression being consi dered in the lights of its reaction upon petty Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf. 3. In 190^ as the result of an outrage on Messrs Wonckhaus followed by an attack on Persians, strong action was taken by the Political Resident, and Major Cox, as he then was, warned the Shaikh with the authority of the Government of India that further neglect of his advice would not be tolerated by the Bri tish Government. This consolidated our position in Bahrein and improvement in trade resulted, but the situation remained unsat- is factory, and remedies were mooted. His Majesty's Government decided however to pursue a cautious policy 11 4. In I$09, w Amelioration was to be sought by indirect andPage 2. W and pacific aeans, thvough an increase of influence with the Shaikh and in this year the Shaikh ( Isa ) ceded jurisdiction | over foreigners. In 1912 the Shaikh successfully defied the v Agency over the question of the L%ding Company, which had in- volTed British subjects in losses of over 50,000/- and insisted I on corresponding the Turkish Wali in Basra in defiance of his treaty provisions. Punishment by mutilation was again resorted | to, and in 1913 a fight of Basrawis occurred. m 5. In the war years the situation remained thoroughly bad, | but Government were preoccupied elsewhere, and as the Shaikh^ attitude was loyal, nothing was done. Also^s in the year 1916 pi there were no less than five separate Political Agents, one a s± | ' clerk and another an invalid,it is not surprising the al Khalifa; got out of hand. In 1919 Shaikh Abdullah returned from present ing his four points to the Secretary of State, returning • demon alised by his vist to Paris and its debaucheries 1 and a reign A ' of terrorism and oppression for Bahama comniences.

Levy Corps had been disbanded owing to incidents and Indians enlisted to Replace them. Mr BeIgrave arrives and reforms begin | to get under weigh. Capt. Parice arrives, and from end of 192^ no further acts of violence taice place# This brief suinmary ; shows quite clearly that Government's policy of non-interference became untenable, and finally they were obliged to act with ■ decision and vigour. 7. I will now consider what reforms x were contemplated. It appears from the letter forwarded with Residency letter to Govt under no.30?/S of 15/6/23^the principal reform contemplates were, reform of finances, including the civil list. Customs, Govt, offices and a survey. As as a result of the second Sitrah outrage a Levy Corps was formed, to be disbanded later and Pun- jabi -fusalmans being subsituted for the l^scati Baluchis. Pearling reforms were also contemplated tho* I cannot crace any proposals made to Govt, concerning this^ Proposals were made for a Judicial assistant to the Political Agent, to be paid for by the State, but this idea was apparently dropped, and fi nally Mr Belgrave was engaged ad Financial Adviser# Mr de Gren- ier had already been engaged to reorganise the Customs after Wr Bower. 8. The reforms that were actually effected are, A. a Financial Adviser controlling all expenditure and doing his best to limit a too buoyant Kx^eKdltsxs Civil List. B* A reorganised Customs department, ith which is combined Boat registration, collection of Pedaling licences. Passport and Port Officer^ duties, C. A reformed Court consisting of the Adviser and Shaikhs her^ apparent, and a lower court composed of the Adst Adviseri\^o) Page 4. and another al Khalifa. 33.

A survey has almost 'been completed and when finished surveyors will he reduced. F. Police under a British Commandant f and no longer under municipality.

Shiah Wacfs removed from Qadhis by populal? desire ^ Bahrain and placed in charge of laymen. An attempt by^Govt to do this in 1926 created a riot, but it has now come about by the action of the Shah's themselves. J. Municipalities# The Manama municipality has made great strides and the newl^t created Muharraq municipality has made wonderful progress. 9. It should be here stated that Bahrein has undergone a marked change in the six years that have followed Shaikh Isa^ deposition. The public are far more enlightened ( it is common to hear mainland Arabs referred to as savagesl) prosper ity has increased, and land values have trebacled. The Bahama have had security and Justice for the first time for 150 years and have come to think of their ri%te. Divers serfage has been much ameliorated and there is little or no opposition to Govern^ mentis activities and crimes of violence have almost ceased. The Persians show,however, an increasingly truculent national spirit, and the Hejdis and Hasawis are as vociferous as before. Instead of resisting reforms, the public spirit now demands them, and an instance of this is the way in ^hich the Shiahs have inder taken the charge of their waqfs. More schools, technical edu cation, medical help and midwives, large public works ( e.g. the Binama- Muharraq causeway and bridge ) are demanded, and the elec-Page 5* trie light installation is eagerly looJced forward to# Best of all our detractors are silent and Bahrein is no longer a news item in the Arab press. 10. I will now consider how far it is possible to go back on these changes. As regard^ A, I consider that it will be im possible to dispense with Mr Belgrave. The fons et origo of our trouble in Bahrein is that the Oovernment of India interfered lacing^ira^with^ 96 0f nature in P rote cUng first Shaikh Isa and then | Shaiich Hamad, In a really free Arab State, Abdullah would have killed ot disposed of these two long ago, and made himself an absolute ruler. Shaikh Hamad does not owe his position to him self, and is amiable and weak, and though successive P *A.s are instructed to allow him to stand on his own feet and act for him self, unless he were to be reborn, he will always lean on the P.A. and if he fails him, do nothing. I can heartily sympathise with him^for in his dislike of bother and in his aflection for a coun try life and shooting his tastes exactly con^Lcide with my own- He dislikes and despises the Bahama who form the bulk of his subjects, and so long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem after lunch, get shooting and hawking and enough money to sup port him he does not mind what happens to Bahrein, though he has j no objection to a little pomp and pride of place# It is ob- » vious that such a man must have an efficient adviser If he is to keep his head above water in these troublous times. II. Shaiidi Abdullah, the only al iOialifa of any ability unusual apart from a record of^profligacy ( he is credited with a'bag' of 500 virgins ) has a redord of crime almost unequalled in any Arab 3tate» and it was only fear that made him cease his efforts to undermine Shaikh Hamad and policy that made him cooperate • ith the reforms. He is in imivb A imi t touch with Bin Saud, tho' outwardly his conduct is irreproachable. Shaikh Salman, Shaikh Hamad's heir, is quite unsophisticated and not far removed from a Bedouin but not devoid of promise, and apart from these the adult al Khalifa are nonentities, incapable or vicious or all three. The Shaikh's responsible minister would have to be anPage 6* an al Khalifa, and I do not know of one who has the training or the qualifications for the tas]c» It has to be rezaembered th4t the projects like the electric light, and Judicial work involve a knowledge far 'beyond the grasp of the al Khalifa, who are far worse educated th in most merchants in the town. I see no alternative to Mr Belgrave at present, and if we want one he must he trained for the work. The most hopeful son that - Shaikh Hamad has who is not too old to learn is Mubarak, and though unfortunately he is married, I recommend that we should concentrate our attention on him, giving him first a tutor who would have a thorough knowledge of administration, say a man of the E.A«G. class. This man should give him a years training and general education, and he should then he sent for three /v Iflfta. years to the Pun^ab^in exactly the same way as political pro bationers are sent. The admin^itration of Bahrein must keep pace ith the times, and this is the only my he will learn how to guide it. tJnle s action is ta^en quickly and steps are taken to see that he really leaSrA some tiling useful, he will soon become as hopeless the rest of his cousins. 12. I have submitted my views about the Customs in my letter No.74of 25/5/29. The director of Customs is really the chief revenue officer in Bahrein, and Passport Officer and Port Officer as well. Mr de Grenier is well fitted for his duties and has increased the yield by 20 % without the duty having been raised in any way. In the days of the Hindus, the accounts were Sept in Sindhi and it was found that apart from the embez zlement of some 100,000 rupees per annum, ter the farmer of the customs allowed several of the biggest merchants, men skuch as Yusuf Kanoo and Yusuf Fakhroo to pay their duty annually I A Syrian or Egyptian would soon acquire great influence if a ca pable man^and might become a political danger. The Syrian Cus toms in Beirut are proverbially dishonest even under French su pervision, and I believe Egyptians have proved a failure even in a much smaller charge like Muscat. 13. The reformed, or rather the new court has done excel-Page.? excellent work, and has the mist confidence of the pa-bllo. They refer all oases laTolTing personal law to the appropriate Qadhls for their opinion and return i hence records are kept ) but dispose of most criminal cases themselves. A few criminal cases which can be settled by oathtaiing are also referred to the 4adhis in the same way. It must be reraembered however that Shaikh Salman would not pasa any order adversely affecting a ^ person of position if it were not for the support of Mr Belgrare, and would certainly not give a capital sentence in any case with out it. A whole hearted return to the Shara'a is impossible# (a) because most of the crimes of violence would be M Sunnis and fagiinst Shiahs, hence on the case being referred to the Sun- ni qadhi they would escape scot free or with light punishment, (b) because the $adMs keep no records, and ( c ) because here as in Persia the ^adhis have lost almost all their prestige in the last few years. Civil cases particularly those Involving the taking of acsaaa counts are usually referred to the Majlis el Irfi, an honorary body of merchants who work quite satisfactorily if their persona, feelings are not aroused. Diving c%t.es are referred to the Sal; fah or diving court, to which I allude later. It will be seen that there is a very large measure of indi genous contrtol, and I feel sure that the Government of India could not favour a return to the chaos of the old regime where no State court existed, and nothing to take its place except the Shara'a £ a reversion to which would be as well advised as to place Ely once more under its Bishop ) and the inuumera-ble courts maintained by petty Shaikhllngs purely as a vehicle fol? their oppression. 14. A properly constituted Diving Cowrt baa been a very euccesful feature of the reforms, and it works with fair impar tiality except where foreigners are involved. In a very big C ase recently I had to depute tiie to watch the pro ceeding® so flagrant was the bias shown. Ae a result the court ultimately decreed in favour of the Persian merchant for somePage* 8 5O t OOQ/- though earlier they wished to force a compromise of Rs 70q/~ on him* It must 'be remembered that if we do not up hold the rights of foreigner© their own Governments will im-ae- dlately claim to do so* Though much still remains to be done great improvemtg ha© been made in checking nakhudas led gers t and divers books are now properly kept# Divers accept the figures shown in their boo&amp;s without question* but raany are ri still indebted for a® much as 300Q/- and are therefore enslaved f ' I to their nakh^das for the rest of their lives. I have never un- | derstood the hypocritical attitude which sheds crocodile tears f over nominal slaves who are usually well treated by tiieir suis- an y | ters a-;id yet refuses to jib thing for a body of mn who are ensla- f ^ P ved to a dangerous professioni mn who if they are 1 protected 1 subjects have to be kept at it by all the rigourc of British law and returned to their masters if they run away and will not | pay their debts* 1 feel that there is nothing that we can undo here without grave injustice to a class that is quite un able to help itself. 15* The Land department has very nearly completed its sur vey* and the title deeds granted are greatly valued# In fact in a case involving property a party usually opens its case by flc rishing the title deed in the face of the court. This, if it^a deed isrued und^r the supervision of the Land dept. is sc usually considered to settle th case out of hand I As a mat ter of m fact there is an urgent need for a settlement and a proper Laud department as understood in India with records of rights* encouragements of improvementxs and loans etc. This department is very pop lara and nothing but good can accrue from it. 16. The 'unjabi Armed Police are efficient and loyal and give no trouble ana. are liked by the Skaikh and people. The old Levy Corps were composed largely of undesirables from Mus cat and ware a source of danger# The uniformed police are mostly Persians as very few Arabs will do this work. They do their work well* and are all dre sed in Arab kit.Page 9# Tha Haturst or night watehi^en» are rather a wild body tot are suited to local requirafiients. This is the only force that Arab® will join as they can resign easily and go diving and they are not obliged to wear uniform. It is found impossible to keep them up to ste|rngth without employing a certain a umber of Ba luchi s, as the only work that really interests Arabs of this class is soiaething to do with boats# It is tune that since the beginning of 1927 crimes of vio lence have been rare, but the fact that my predecessor, an offi- exceptional car of v experience and ability in dealing with Arabs was able, by a prudent policy of cautious consolidation to realise peace for over tw© years, must not be allowed to give the im pression that the Police force are in any way unnecessary or or unduly large, the prosperity of Bahrein attracts a floating population of undesirables at the best of times, and such peo ple need a firm hand* 17, I do not feel that this is the moment to part with the British Comroandant of Police, Captain Parke• shall shortly see an oil company commencing operations on a great scale and hundreds of rascals and cutthroats thronging in their footsteps. They have the right to appoint their own police and will certain ly ap oint one or more Europeans for the work* In such a crowd of Europeans our Com^aiidant of Police will be unnoticed, and in view of the collisions with Europeans and Eurasians that will undoubtedly occur we need someone with authority to deal with them. Captain Parke is popular with the Shaikh, ( if not so popular with the public ) and it is essential that there should be someone to act for Mr Belgrave when he goes on leave. r de Grenier is quite unfitted to do this, not has he the time. I believe, however,that a better for the job than Captain Parke could be found, and I know an ex-Migerian Civil servant who would be more suitable. Until the question of the oil is finally settled I consider we should retain a British Commandant, but if the concession Is not taken up, the post might if Government ar determined to discharge one adviser.be allowed to lapse* 18# The Indian Armed Police do certainly catcia the eye* as Sir IDeny© Bray has observedf and advertiee British Control so I recommend their replacement by Sudanese. Yemenis have an un enviable reputation for treachery and mutiny, and would be no improvement on the old Levy Corps# but I fought with Sudanese in the gXHxt War# and have the highest opinion ox' their value# Their toowled^e of Arabic would be a great asseti and owing to the number of negroid divers and other© here, they would be incon-* spieuous in Arab clothing whe^a» an Indian in Arab dress is al ways recognisable at a distance# We could import them direct from Port Sudan and they would probably be cheaper in the long run than Indians. I sug est that lr BeIgrave selects the* men on his way back from leave in 195I waen the contracts of the pre sent force will have expired. It would be most advisable Ixsim for him to do this as military units have an unpleasant habit of transferring men they wish to get rid of, and the Bahrein State had a deplorable experience of this in the old Levy Cprps. Should it be desired to take this step at once, Captain Parke could come through the Sudan on his way back from leave and bring the men with him, but this would involve the State in large sums for breach of contract. 19. As regards Public Works, the Kanama Sea Road is complete, the contract for the Electric Light scheme given out, and the Shaikh's palace and other works have been completed, and now, the dearest wish of the Bahrein public, the Manama-ifoharraq cause way and bridge will shortly be commenced. The British Government has acquired great merit by these works, for the public realise that but for us they would have never been undertaken. There is nothing that can be undone here, and I feel that further progress cannot be objected to, so long as projects are soundly conceived and within the means of the State. 20. Five boys schools and one gxM girls school now exist, as compared with one in 1921• For want of local material these schools are staffed almost entirely with Iraqis and Syrians.Page II. (ifD An instance of the growing prestige of tlx© Bahrein Government has just come to light# Shai&amp;h AMullah^who has had entire charge of the Sunni schools from their inception has just cosae to see r BeIgrave and told hte that he is not satisfied with their pre sent conditiont tiiat he wishes the:a to be under the Government in the future 9 and that at he feels he does not know enough to direct their energies singlehanded he wishes a good inspector to be engaged especially for them. This, coupled with the increa sing demand for technical education shows that the State is hard put to it to meet the demand for education let alone consider a reactionary step This education is however* dependent for its existence on the funds collected by the Director of Customs f and conserved by the Adviser, and any Ids of revenue would serious ly affect it* 20, With the approval of the State but entirely of their own accord the Sha&amp;hs decided that they could isanage the Wa&amp;fs better than the C^adhis and have tacen them over without opposi tion. Public opinion will no doubt soon move the Sunnis to take the sane steps and then large sums now pocketed by the ^adhis will become available for primary education and other purposes for which the endowments were made- I see nothing to be gained by putting the cloclc back here § and it is well known that the Egyptian, Iraq and Syrian Governments have already organised Waqf departments. 21. The Manama municipality have made great strides and Mu- harraq is rapidly catching up Manama* The city fathers take them selves very seriously, but if suddbsk neither the Adviser or the Political Agent are present their meeting is apt to degenerate into a screaming match. Much sound work has,however, been done and their work is on the whole appreciated by the public. A minimum of interference is made by the Adviser, who in fact has fc little time to give'them, and the Political Agent only takes ac tion when British or foreign interests are involved. Towns of over 25,000 inhabitants must have minicipalitics, and these are no exception to the rule.Page 12. 22« I confess that I can find nothing that can be uprooted in all this, for what were considered startling lanoTations six ■ years are now accepted as part and parcel of every day life# 'Tor do I feel that Bahrein can aptly be compared with Kalat# So far a® I know there are no foreign powers restless and eager to to envelop with large and tiubulent settlements of their na tionals within its frontiers. I do not Icnow how many British of ficials there are in Kalat, but mk when X was in Eajputana there were certainly three in Tonic, a state of far less Imperial import tance than Bahrein, and two of these -ere government servants on deputation* If Indian Sates be cited as a parallel I will say that in no Indian State does the Political Agency handle 2000 civil and criminal cases per annum coming from all over the State and not from any ceded area, and th t so long as this position as is maintained, and mm long ae we re, resent foreign interests it k must be, so long will a readjustment of the number of British of ficials have little effect* 23, Bahrein is the keystone of our position in the Gulf, and the navel of the Arabian Air route, and a demand will shortly come from the Royal Air Force to be allowed to place half a squadron here, or at least a flying boat. Our penetration of Bahrein has been inevitable and is now accepted and it is too late to go back now. In fact, it is obvious to the student of history that Bahrein will become another Sanaibar. If a protec torate is declared the day will be hastened and as the adminis tration is more closely regulated,so our re 1 power will diminish Just as the power of the District Magistrate in Mount Abu has decreased since it was leased from the Sirohis State and made British territory. We should therefore, while not risiting the improvements we have faced so much obloquy to bring about, set our face against any further extension of British influence, which,paradoxically,will only weaken our position, arid put off the evil day of what I may term Xanaibarisation as long as pos sible. Even Bin Saud is reported to have said that the Bahrein Shaiichs have solved their difficulties and have more money toPag© 13# spend thrm ever before, so the effects of our peaetyatioa my not appear as unpalatable as we think# 24. I take it that Oovemmnt* b fear tma: our action in Bah rein will have unfavourable reperaussions on smaller Arab rulers is directed at the Trucial Coast and %atar. Both of these un doubtedly have leaning® ( apart from religious reaons ) towards Bin Baud for his agents are with them the whole time# whemreas their only experience of us is confined to occasional menacing appearances connected with the arm traffic or slavery or faci lities for aircraft* If we wish to have any iaflue^ce g wi||| these peoplet whose mental processes are little removed from^a tribes- zmn of the days of Abr&amp;hamt we must be able to offer them some thing in return for their friendship other than demnds or threats. 2ft. It is a mtter of common joi owl edge that since the loss of the f Lawrence 1 the Political Department has been issnobilised in the Gulf, and the Trucial Coast has been run largely by a ser- len of sloop commanders# or rather thai iaterpifeters* On rr^r recent visit to Abu Dhabi I found that no one there imew the name of a single Political Officer except Sir Percy Coxt for wx=om they appeared to have the greatest veneration. The brother of the Shaikh of Debai said to me when he was here 11 Ya baliuz, trade Coklcus was our father ■ -e cannot indefinitely on Sir Percy's reputation# and I only quote this to prove what I have always understood, that Arabs# though hostile to foreign penetra tion, are susceptible to personal friendships with British offi cers, even against their better judgment* It is by this means, and hy a more constant contact by properly qualified people, that we shall recover lost ground on the Trucial Coast, and not by throwing overboard officials in Bahrein Just as everyone is convinced the reign of Saturn is about to return. In this connection , if lajor Trevor could say in 1912 that ^ It is to he regretted in some ways that the p^groccupations of the Political Agent in Bahrein and the largely judicial position he holds nsake it difficult for him to go out of his way to culti*-Page 14♦ the ▼ate the acquaintance of^ Arabs personally 11 the remric ha® great er force now, v ;he&amp; double the number of judicial eases are dealt with* I personally consider th t I should spend hours daily in the society of the ShaiJch? and iriporttuit Arabs# and so do more to win their confidence than penning the nimblest judgments would achievet and I trust that the proposals which I shall presently put forward will receive sympathetic eonsider tion. 26« It must be remembered that if we will not assert our- bc Ives in Bahrein,others will, and the ground is steadily pre pared for Bin Saut by his powerful and assiduous ^ent| should he succeed in is present cas^agn in Hejd we may expect an iame* diate resumption of his penetration here, a penetration which would find araple scope if Mejdis and Hasawis affairs were handed hack to the Bahrein Government. It must be remembered that Bin Baud has an almost mes oeric effect on shaikh Hamad# and it is a^y constant fear th t in setting Bin Saud up as an all-Arabian con queror we shall have provided ourselves with another Rem Shah to clip our wings, and have cut a rod for our backs without receiving any substantial return* 27* It has been suggested that in order to bring the Shai&amp;h^ rule into the foreground a council should be appointed* This would probably be of value if Shaikh Hamad were allowed to trans fer real power to it and to rule as a ruler advised by his minis ters* Shaikh Hamad would be delighted by such an arrangement, and on the death of Shaikh Isa it might be given a trial# The council could be composed of ShaiJsh Salman and Shaikh Abdullah anc the Adviser* SJmiMi Salnan's claim as heir is obvious, and Shaikh Abdullah apart from his ability seems to have turned over a new leaf and should be worth a trial. But * I feel we should wait until Shaikh Isa dies, for the State already supports one Shaikh in idleness, and to support two generations at a cost of 2% laichs would cause unfavourable comment* If Shaikh Hamad were made PresKident of this council^nothing would be gained as his aversion to any form of work would make him avoid its deli berations, and the division of authority that would ensue would (Ug)Page 15. v --- onlji cause confusion.

I have just discussed the question of a tutor for : ubaral, with Shaiida Hamad* Be %ould welcome onei especially one who could train him in admialetr&amp;tive mav.ters, but he said that ihe could not possibly leave Bahrein as he was married* and could not take his wife with him. To leave the State without her is apparently unthinkable. I then suggested that Baiy should be sent to the ilitary School in Iraq which catered for boys of good family f but he told me that this would also be imporeible^ for apart from the great love they all had for him ( a thorough ly spoilt child ) both he and Mubarak had lost weight when they were sent to Basra to the American school f and the servant sent with tuom had died of consumption shortly after their return/ I propose therefore to concentrate on getting a suitable tutor and will trust to overcoming the Shai&amp;h's objections to a wider experience for Mubarak later* 119, A son of Shaiich Ibrahim, now on holiday from Beirut University# seens to be the only young al Khalifa with a tas«te for work and I suggest that when he has completed his course tka there he should be sent to India for training by the Customs Department# and then to Basra to stucy conditions there# with a view to becoming an assistant to Ir de Grenier ana when he under stood the work taking it over. This will be a solution for one adviser but not an im. ;edi -te one. I am particularly anxious to avoid pMtiftg -&gt;/rian and Egyptian fre3la- ces to high posts in the State# and if Bin Baud 1 s Foreign Minister could say to a foreign repejrsentative { Jeddah diary for March *22 ) * I am the Xing# the Amir and the Government in the Hedjass 11 what my we o expect in Bahrein.

'emorandum* In continuation of jay letter C/84 and in reply to your telegram regarding reforms in Bahrein ray reply to the points raised is as follows. 2. The demand for medical help and midwives came from the Baladiyya # and so may well be said to be general. The demand for technical education is very widely felt and though I have only discussed the matter with the better edu cated I can safely say that there is a very general wish for some form of it in Bahrein. It is frequently pointed out to me that all masons and carpenters and almost all mecknics are brought in from outside* Kanoo is opposed to it# or at any rate damns it with faint praise# as he would prefer that his mechanice should be the only skilled men in the Islands. 3. I have revised rnyiatt opinion about Shailch Ab dullah and I think that any messages that pass between him and Bin Saud are probably only polite nothings. His dislike or jealousy of Bin Saud was proved in no uncertain way the day before D left. He told me about the narrow escape of Bin Saud son betweennRiadh and Hasa and the burning of all his cars with obvious pleasure at his discomfiture. 4« I fear Mubarak will need more than a year with a tutor before he can derive much advantage from outside trian- ing. It was never my intention that he should be trained up to be anything but an assistant to Shaikh Salman# ■ hose claim I mention in para 27. 5. Shaikh Hamad has agreed to a tutor# and I am asking separately fcr his deputation.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter no. ?. 164-11/29 of the SBth May 1929 aaking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a tiew to deciding how far it Is pos sible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken. 2. The history of the development of our concern in the internal affairs of the islands is fully set forth in Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth's m. 296-3. of 1st Heptember 1927 # so it is unnecessary to repeat it. I wish, however, to stress the following points : (a) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as Kuler of the islands and it was entirely due to our sup port that he had been able to keep his position (b) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration; (c) From 1904, with the appointment of a British Political :l i- 2 - p®JUtical Agent t© B^ain after the visit of Lord Cursson t our interettts in internal matters increased # and we continued to press Shaikii I©a with good advice. Me # however, seened • more concerned with preserving his independence from us $ than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained; (d) In 1904 g following on riots in which Persians and a Geriaan were concerned an^i in which haikh Isa was first supine and timn obstructive, the Viceroy f Lord Curaon, advocated vigorous measures against hiM as he was 'only encourag ed in his obstinacy by our continued forbear ance* 1 . ^he moat important results of our intervention were the abolishment of Bhukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti- PorslaJ&gt; riots (who was Shaikh isa's own nephew), and the assumption by the Political t Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political lie si dent. In this case the impossibility of obtain ing justice for Bhiahs from the Bunni Qadhis was brought t© notice. In connection with these events Major Cose reported : '1 do not see how wc can expect anything but periodical trouble from 9 a continuation of our laudable endeav ours to carry on the Government of the * inlands through -he rule of a chief, who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the securitysecurity of pe re emu md ©f trade 1 ?; he was accordingly in favour of stronger measures but His IIajeoty , » Goverm^ent decided that the amelioration of the internal govern ment should Ise sought by indirect and .pacific means; In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla's interview with Hir Arthur Hirtael showed how Uie Ruler chafed against the interference of the rolxtical ^ent in the matter of Jurisdiction over foreigners and appointraents to the Bench of Magistrates* Uthough the Political Agent possessed these powers t he was powerless to stop misrule; The gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Xsa in 1923 rescued the people — # especially the Baharanah, am the opening that this oppression gave to foreign nations — es pecial ly the .Persians and the Wahahis. *fhe oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly 1 s report forwarded to Government under Colonel Trevor f s letter Ho. 25-n. # dated the 8th January 1922; Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Gov eminent that thejwhole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the Political Agent; With an uneducated Arab independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve.

Throughout the history of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Govenwnent of India is apparent. Xn 1904 they decided •ts pursue a cautions policy'. iAter, the Political Agent was to 'seek the amelioration of the internal govermaent toy indirect and pacific meane, and by gaining the confidentw and trust of the Bhaikh^o yti* In 1922 they Mid desire to be drawn into inter- A ference between the Bhailch and his people 1 *. 'Govemwent are not pi*epared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted • Yet it was this Governiaent, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the J'olitical Resident to take the steps which led to the deposition of the ' uler. 'the never, however, forgot their original policy, and within a couple of months are again warning the Political Agent to be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much, or to toe cone the administrative officer rather than the adviser. It is obvious that Oovemraent did their very best to avoid the action of 1983; but it was forced on then by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, shorn shaikh lea made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London storeijin Office, fearful of the reaction in 'ersia of the oppression of a !?hiah population, and because 'misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the siatus of Bahrain and our position in the Inlands was brought before the League of nations'.- 5 - (® Yhe point to repieraber now in thut .'halkli X8a t the Ruler, was not bad natured at heart, but alttaoufch obstinate in rejecting all advice from the political Agents as derogatory to his position a an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of meiabers of his faraily wven when these took the form of gross tyranny. The family — the Al Khalifa — were uneducated savages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Khaikh ioa and his faiaily was as iu described in paragraph 2(h) above. Sow tiaikh Hamad is extreiaely amiable, witli a conutitutional disinclination to take strong meaeures on any subject. -ven as a judge, his inclination ia to acquit an obviou^criminal and hira- self to pay a fine imposed. Such a man — except in the fact that he is younger and has seen changea taking place around him and that he is, in conaeijuence, less conserva tive — is not to be differentiated from his father. Just as his father permitted opprension but did not activelj opprese, so would Hamad act. With the exception of Rhaikh Khalid, all the old oppreBoors are still alive and willing to reBume their former waya if not represBed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repreeo them if deprived of activ* British support and direction. To this day his weakness in any matter connected with the Al Khalifa ie pathetic. In ordinary matters also, in apite of the prcBence in Bahrain of a British adviser, he truckles to any show of force. In Kay of this year he reversed a decieion he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to divers because a mob of two hundred unarmed laen made a clamour in his Majlis. It ie certainly better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none, but a mm of his type, who will not incur the odium of governing, muat have an adviser. if the European Adviser were removed. Shaikh llumad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or~ 6 ~ or Egyptian who m»uid # for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Kajd. It was the defenceieBBn«s» of the Bahrain Govenuneiit in the face of gang roVberiee which led to the institution of the xndian arried police. These police had to be foreign m the B^ii rain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation unconnected with boats and dii'liked binding himself to 'fixed periods of duty. The avzaed police are tjtill neces sary, but it May be possible to make Jtiem less obstrusively foreign by substituting udanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter empires at the beginning of 19ol. Owing to the large number of blacks, aeocended from slaves domiciled in the Islands # the 'udanese would melt into the landscape in a way the Indians fail tcjdo* Mr Belgrave, the present Adviser to nhaiJch Ha^iad, ims experience of udanese, having served with hem in T7 gypt during -he war. I would have recommended that the present European Com mandant of Police — whose four-year contract expires about the sane time - should depart witli tiie Indian policeiaen at the end of 1930. In view, however, of the probability that Bahrain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign drillers ana oil workers, I do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Folic# unless and until we are satis fled that the threatened invasion — *liich would certainly include a number of tough characters — will not take place. On the analogy of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, the Gulf .Syndicate would probably start a Security service of its own, and the Bahrain State will require a T uropean Commandant of 'oiice to deal with it, and with the bad characters attracted by the chance of employment. 5, i turn now to the Customs JPepartinent. This was an old bone of contention between nhalkh Xsa aria the uovem ment of India. It was Colonel Heftd who first suggested bringing- 7 - bringing X% under controXt under the mis taken nsounsptlon that nhaikh X&amp;&amp;, \mn really a» poor aB he pretended ^rhen the pi'etonoe suited him* In any caae tlie queution of the Customs Department casae for a time to be looked upon ao a trial of strength between Shaikh iea and the Government of India* The old oystem was to farm out the custom© to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to the State was much less than it should have been* This loss v;as estimated at one lakh of rupees a year # but judging from the yield of the Custo&gt;is since it has been put under conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more* Customs is the main source of revenue to the Gtate and brought in during the past year Hs* 11,24,679 out of a total of Ho* 12,15,694* The Director of Customs is not only in charge of the department from which he takes his name, but he is also Port Officer and controls the rassports, Hegistration of Boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various depart ments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them* At present the head is a European* is anything to be gained by substituting an gyptian, Syrian or iraqian ? To the untrained eye of an nglishman, an Egyptian might look more indigenous than an Knglishman, but to a resident of the Gulf he ^ould still be a foreigner 'he Customs is not a political department and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like mhrain the personality of the man who collects 90^ of the revenues must count for something* As in the case of the Adviser why jettison a European, who can be trusted, in order to replacereplace him toy oorae forei(?n Oriental about flJiooe integrity and whose intrigue b one can never be sure 6. Captain iTior, the prenent h-olitical A &lt;?ent at Bahrain, auimed up the situation very well in one of hie reports to me when he stated that «r de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr Bclgrave conserves them. If the efficient collector and conserver are removed, what ia to happen to a State, which lias be cone accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history tHot only have the claiiao of the ille and ever increasing Al Khalifa been generously met, but for the first time Bahrain has been aduinistered for the good of s people and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, dir.content is sure to return. If the European Wviaer were removed, his place woula be taken by an Arab from Bahrain — almost certainly one of the Al Khalifa. With the exception of Bhaikh Abdulla there is at the moment not a single member of the Al Khalifa fit either by character or education to i'ill the post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principalit; as those of the Trucial Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh century. Thanki^to its geographical situa tion aa the gateway to Hajd and to the pearl trade of which it is the centre, it has always been MttK a trading centre, of and has attracted to a nuraber^foreigners, who are in contact with she outside world. 'hanks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1925, its administra tion, once a by-word, is now the adiaira-ion of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens of Bubai, for instance, envy Bahrain though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to copy it. 7, it has repeatedly been said that Bahrain has been westernised too hurriedly. It neoeasary to examine thii statement for although there is a substratum of truth in it. I think it conveys a wrong impreuaion that all native InotitutioftB- g - institution® have been ruthlessly snept away. the reform© instituted in or shortly before 1923 related to - (a) Municipalities.

(a^ Before and during the war, Haiirain was notorious for its unhealthy climate, the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside worl*. A demand fof greater cleanliness aro^e and in sp ife of the opposition of Shaikh isa # the dmand t backed by Major Dickson (the Political agent), prevailed and a Municipality was established in 1930. this municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed by the establishment of another in Muharraq. The two Municipal Councils — the members of which are partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected —- are presided over by shaikh Hamad's brother. The Political Agent and Adviser attend the meet ings but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance. In 1920 # a considerable ..art of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable u- foreign innovation, butyls now recognised as a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand wi thout• 10 &amp;&gt; without coneultinj tiie •oXitical Atent. :*ople recocnii-.e that if the municlpalitiea vterc aOolished filth pi8. c ;u« would return.

'•hey qo not interfere unduly# and heir complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affaire would be unpopular. (to)# (c) and (dj have already been treated in para- 4 tuid b alcove.. (e) ?laJor Daly's report on the state of affaire in 1923 shows the conditions froM which Bahrain was rescued. ^ihese conditions were largely due to the l&amp;cic of imy Court of uw, which could deal efficiently with offenders. the minor members of the Khalifa family terrofciseu iitt i^eople Just as they wished. The adhis were corrupt or impotent. V frood Court of haw was a crying need, bu. the T.J difficulty max to find a suitable magistrate. /v- tiv^t the Politicril Agent (Major Dalyj sat as adviser to the local magistrate# but with the arrival of Mr Belgrave he resigned his position to tUe latter. It present Uiere are t^e' following courts functioniu in Bahrain (1) The Joint Court on which the Ruler and the Political V,ent sit to hear ca^es# civil imd criminal, involving foreign una Bahrain subjects, in which the latter are defendants. there is also a nimll Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant ant. a minor \l FChalifa; (2) The ulitical Agent's Court for the trial of ail cases in which foreigners are concerned; (3) r :iw Court of :halkh ulaiican# eldest son of .' haixh Hamad# assisteu mtu advised b„ Mr .-•elvrave for the trieil of Bahrain subjects;- u - (4) The Cmall Cauoe Court conducted by a minor laerober of the AX Kiiaiifau In the first case ail dlaputeu are referred t© one or other of these Courts. they usaall.; deal tiiemselves with criminal caaeB though a conoiderabl^ number are re ferred to the aclhiB for i ettlem^nt b the taking of oath.

The Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing i^ith the customary law of trade. It is th« comiercial court and all difsputed commercial cases are referre. to it. There are twenty members. It© nmetinfrB are weekly — ten members sitting on alternate hursdays, under an al Klialifa presiden 4 It deals with trade disputes, on the v,«hole expeditiously mo. well. Its members are all anointed by niiuikh ftu?nad # subject in the case of -foreign mmtoerm, to the Political .\gent # » veto. Th« rialifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to diving. Before 1923 this Court consisted of one venal old man whose decisions were a disgrace to Uie 3tate. Now, except for a bias against foreigners, it functions satisfactorily. 'Prom this description it will be seen that except inIn the Court of the Agtmt established under the Order in Council — a inembe r of he Ai iOuuifa ia aasociateu with all the proceedings of jutstice• .ven the Political Agent f 0 Court refers riany mtteM for native opinion rovci advice?.

I mention w on its own initiative' because all public utility schenes — except the Manama aea wall and road, which are the vork of l-fajor Daly, — were conceived by Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their ■ uropean advisers for guidance. The British ntmw is benefited by this progress. (1J Fducation ii$ still backward, but thanks to the push of haikh bdulla, the iler's brotir^er, it has rmde immense strides during the i^ast two /ears. Tht* drive in bis case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves. Except in the matter of making hitherto fruitless efforts to persuade haikh H^rmd to educate his own sons, neither unduly the Political Vrent nor the Adviser has taken any s teps/to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been put at the service of the rotate, when as iced. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases- 14 - cases without the intex'Tention of the Political h^;mt or Advlser t at good salaries aixi there are now five indigenous Arabic 'boys' schools and one girls' school on the island, in addition to two ^rsian nationalist schools. In axldition, eight B(i^irairi bo^s, including three clone rela tions of the aling ChiedT, have been sent to the American TTnlwersity at Beirut for education. 1 trust that the tie three boys ivill turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak — the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad — will provide material for the higher appointments in th«r State, and ultimately will prove com petent to take over the position now held by the ' uropean Adviser and Gustoms Director.

KecentXy the Bhiahs themselves appointed a cormaittee whidi took over their aqfs fron the adhi• If the 5unnis follow suit, large tmm now pocket^ed by the adhis nay become available for primary education. 8. I have exainined the present conauct ol affairs in Bahrain and X see nothing that can be profitably altered at the x &gt;reaent moment. Innovations which .met witii opposition in 1923 are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things; and the Bail rain merchants look forward to the development of air communication under British auspices. 1'he unpopularity of the British Govern tent, which was wortcea up in trie Arabic and other press, has now disappeared and their good works areare appreciated• In time the ^ood isorks mid the tyranny from 1^1 ich tm British rescued iiaiirain ^Kl especially the Shi all Baharanah will be forgotten, and only tJie privileged position of the British occupying the chief poets will be noticed• To avoid U ni odium which wouicl fail on BySSsl* / in course of time^ from this cause it is necessary U; educate natives of Baiirain to take the place of the British officials* 9# Captain 'rior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful understudy for Mr de Grenier offers In Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim 41 Klmlifa — at present a third- y ar student at tine American University in Beirut. He has industry but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithiietie. Captain 'rior thinks # however, thai 4ien he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Dspartaaent at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Cub tons with a view eventually to &amp; taking over charge. I consider Captain Hrior's proposal very sound and recomiend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Hhaikh Ibrahim's indifferent aritiimetic is a bar to the efficient perforftiance of his duties, one of his yuui , er cousins ShaikJi Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or haikh Hamad bin llhaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy uler, ~ who are first-year students at Beirut, might later be selected for training. 10. There renains the question of a successor to the adviser. Although Oovemment do not appear to desire the te.'nediate removal of Kr '-'v Igravc, ihis question .must be con sidered. ShaiKh Hamad # the Deputy 7!uler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain rior in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet has stated truly: ^so long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the- 16 - ♦♦the hare£s # get ohooting mid hawking and enough money to w sup^ort him with a little poiap and pride of place, he doee M not mind what happens to Bahx^ain'.

Of haikh Hamad's eons the one who shows raost promise is haikh Mubarak, the fourth son. In ray le ser Ho • 366 •'B • of Jllst August 1929 1 have aire ad re cotnme nd ed that a good tutar should be obtained for hi®. it is hoped that In due course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help first to his father and then to his bx*other, 3ulaiinan, who has no son^ to follow after hii&amp; f and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the European Adviser. 11. 11th Oie spread of education it should be possible to conduct the administration of Bahrain without any British I interference in internal affair# in a Manner which .,111 not shame us. At pre sen c, owing to the weakness of the I'eputy uler and the lack of men of suitable character, this is Impossible. I have laid articular stress on education in the rulers because the merchant classes in Hahrain, both for eign and native, are advancing rapidly in this respect; and the public are demanding more schools, technical education, increased medical help and trained midwives, and larger public works. ♦ A go-ahead population cannot t)ermanontly be ruled by~ 17 - by uneducated tribeBmen any more than Moroccan troopc could permanently hold down .he Bhine provinottt* iJaJirain is a large trading centre witii a large foreign population.

The evils of unadulterated Arab rule and he trib al systeza are exemplified by the recent blood-stained record of Umm al ;uwaim and Abu Dhabi or t to take bigger people froia history, the Bani Kasiiid Rulers of Hail or the Haiyids of Oman.

In addition, on the score of expense to the ::tatu, it is not desirable that aiirain, which is already paying a pension of Hb . 5,000 yearly to ahalkh Isa, houla be saddled with an idle Ilamd. I anticipate no serious opposition from Bhuikh Haraad himself to the idea of a Council provided he is still titular and social head. It will .-ive him a chance of that otium cum di^nitate for which he craves.

It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Hr de Grenier; but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. i*?» As the coining of an oil company is still prob lematical, 1 have not o iscussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself western ise the isianas in possibly an unfortunate way, and I pre- would sune there^HMi have to be a British element in tlie admin istration to counteract its effects. IB. It appears from paragraph 2 of your letter under u^uz reply that Government is perturbed at the danger that the A example of anrain before their eyes^ ihe minis of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin naud. It is true that the hai ichs of the ' rucial Coast are extremely Jealous of any British encroachment on theirtheir independence g just as Bhaikh lea wm before his forced, relinguishuaerit of po^er• Yhey oppose any qqii ** ceeolon to the uropcan. I do not, however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in 'ahrairi. It in due far more to the natural e ^ccluBiveneBB of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from ulen as well as from Mecca* Bo atterait had been imde to westernise Bahrain when the *%acinth* episode of 1911 occurred. it is from this incident arm the comparative immunity from evil con sequences enjoyed by the peoftLe of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the 'rucial Hh ikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnish©* a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections to the admission of Buropeana to the coast. His statement was true in 1911 mid is true to this day; but the British policy in iahraitl obviously can^not be blaiaed for this. if we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its r.haikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we huve forfeited Arab respect and cleared the way for Bin Gaud. in 1920 Major pickson reported our position in tkie island Is founded on fear and not respect*'• INMi it is founded on ret)i-ect• The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain ana even its chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to caxl in British advisers on tJheir own account, but in '♦ fr r f ir tirae Uieir aversion from contact with the European rmy be overcome through ihe in*iuence mt a civilised Bahrain* it will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. 11 i *• suits Bin Saud he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. trh«21- The attitude of the Shaikh© of the Coast will be guided by self-interest as it has ever 'been, if tie have comj ietently aria with succe^B espouaed tlieir cause against 'eraia and Ilajd. they mil look to uh for eupport. If we liave shovm no great energy in supporting their caae against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily suc- cuiab to Ilajd intrigue. If Bin r-aud emerges victorious tvoM his lire sen t troubles 9 it is pus si hie •■.hut lie; will seek to extend his influence on the Coast and cause us trouble as T esa -hah has in Persia; but i do not see how the situa tion in : a,:.rain nil ali'ect : ;.&lt; All Tabs critieised our action in Bahrain whm the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement.

Yh© Xaot ftmr years have seen great chances. Armed attacks are n© l©nger a feature ©i the Islands, and the trials last year have assorted ©nee and fer all the ^©ctrin© that n© ©nu is above the law. The Baladiyyas have made some improvements, and schoolc have increased in number. The State improved its financial position as a result of pr©s- »per©us year and w©rk has commenced en the electrificatien pr©ject. The Civil List has been ( let us h©pe ) stabilised, though at an unnecessarily feigh figure. 3* Sotting aside some colxapse in the pearl markot, I think that this yoare^eceipts will probably be the lowest figure that we need nntiqipgvte. The effects ©f the slump may be felt m©rtt acutely next year in the pearl werld, but we shall net have the interruptions onused to trade by civil war in b©th Hojd and Persia. Als© ©very day m©re and nore people come to Bahruiii, and even at the present rate ©f tax the Customa dues cannot fail to bring in a gradually incr©as~ -ing revenue. 4. I would b* glad if y&lt;?u would take advantage of de Grenier's last few days to ask him to outline exactly what he considers his requirements in capital expenditure for Dalrympl© Belgravo, Bsquire, Adviser, Bahrain Gevernment, Bohraim.for the next four yourc. So fax, fer reasons which arc well known te yeu, a progrtowme has never 'been contemplated either for CucteuiD or any other/department, ami the Customs has suffered for the lack of one, The most important objects appear to mo to be a crane, an extension of the pier and trolly line f and more shoft accommodation• The question of finance I will go into later, only remarking thatthe pier tax specially sanctionoe to repay the cost of the original pier, has been i:ept on and devoted to other uses, and many thousand rupees have been received under this head that have not been devoted to the object for which it was collected. 5. The most oeriouo criticism that can be levelled against the expenditure of tLo past fev/ years is that practi- -©ally none of it 9 even including the sea read or electric light expenditure has been productive expenditure . The Islands do not earn a penny more because there is a sea road, and the day for the industrial use of electricity in Bahrain will net dawn for seme time. On the other hand, had a bold agrarian policy been undertaken, some 10,000 persons might have been settled on the land. The appointment of an agricultural export cannot be any longer delayed, and the sooner artesian wolls are sunk on land belonging to Government, the sooner an alternative and permanent income oan be assured to the State, provided always that the rapaciou al-Khalifa oan eurb their land hunger. 6, Our eduoation policy has alse been one of fits and starts, and wo have Xittlo to show for a very large expenditure of money. I will deal with this separately in another letter, but as regards the future X think we should work for a small ana well conducted secondary school, and give up the iaea of sending boys away from their homes. 7. We are committed to the Manama-Muharraq sea road and the sooner it is finished the better since it bars all other capital expenditure. Both for this and the Customs pier, there is only one plan suitable, and that is a loan at the first favourable opportunity. The Stat© security is amulei8 ample for a. five lakh loan, anu oven if only half were raiyeii it would be most useful. 8. Further mociioal work probably fally within the purview of the Baladyyfeo. ana it will be necosyary to stimulate their iatereatc in thouo matters. Bahrain is not badly off for hospitals, but midwifery and child welfare requires early attention. 7. It would probably savo time if we dis- -cussod these and kindred matters, but my object in writing is to a si: you to obtain from de Grenior a statement of what he considers he wants in the next four years, and that the necessary ostimates should bo worked out . The Customs is the principal earner of revenue and anything that improves the working of tho port is to the benefit of the Islands. The near future iaay see some improvement in either lias Tanurah or Ojair which by buoying or other means may make xhem possible porttu and the only way to minimise auch rivalry is to get ao loftG ^ start as possible. 8. ]?leatie do not imagine that I am reilectig in any way as your mishandling of the State finances.

The only further developmeritahave been attacks in the Iraqi and, it i® believed, Uyrian press, attributing the strike to the autocratic iaethods of the Political Agent, ^ho, it i© said, endeavoured to impose the study of Kngliah on all forms, and when the teachers protested had them deported. It need hardly be added that this statement is absolutely untrue, and Captain Prior informs fae that, on the contrary, he has on accasions warned the educational authorities that he thought they were inclined to mile boys coromence Fngiish too soon. g. The trouble was at two of she flunni schools only; the nhiah schools did not join in. The two masters were Syrian, from the Hauran, and were sent back there via Karachi. r rhey had been organising processions of school-boys and parading the town; and since2 - since a down boat was In harbour and an mail not clu« for five ^ayB they were fient by timt i-oute.

No: &amp; The 12th May 1930, Ay 1 regret I have been so long answering your letter fe: 73-S, but I have been making sotae investigations regarding the Shaikh's sons, which, however, I am dealing with in a separate letter. 2. I am in absolute agreement with your view that we should give the boys their secondary education in Bahrain, but it will not be possible to make a start now for two reasons. Firstly, the finances of the State are not thorough ly sound, and instead of increasing its expenditure on educa tion it will be obliged to cut it down, since we anticipate that next year will show an even greater drop in revenue than this year. Secondly, after the upheaval in the Sunni schools this Spring, time is wanted for them to settle down and pull their weight before other innovations are made. 3. The question of the boys at Beirut has largely settled itself. All except the three Al-Khalifah boys are being taken away at the end of the school year, and if they show any promise will be employed in the State. The whole scheme of education in Bahrain has beaa deplorably bungled but no portion of it more so than this despatch of boys to Beirut at a cost of ±hE quarter of the total education budget, and being obliged to economise this has been chosen as the place where it will do least harm. As you know the boys were not chosen for their ability or moral character and they had the impertinence (excepting the Al Khalifa boys)to join in a telegram of protest when the two headmasters were dismissed. They might well have protested Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel H.¥.Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.protested , soeing that they owed thiir time at Beirut to one of the series of ramps vdaich these worthies^ * put over •'The Al Khalifa hoys will remain on for the present, although since they have now gone on a private trip to Cairothsir time at Beirut will probably do them more harm than I expected. 4. I said that education in Bahrain had been a de plorable bungle,. Had I not be n running this Agenqy with one hand tied behind my back I should have discovered it earlier, and taken greater interest in it. Trie State haa been spending increasing amounts on schools until this year they will have spent the really very creditable sum of Rs 90,000 on it, without having one dec ait school to show for it. Until very recently the vahole amount was spent by a small and re actionary conmittee without any control or inspection. It was the importation of the Inspector and resent at the curtailment of their peculations that precipitated the 'strike'and the dismissal of the headmasters.' 5. Unfortunately Belgrave has not been able to give much time to the Education Department, having more pressing work elsewhere, and he probably realised the storm any alter— -ations would create. Also it is a subject of which he has no administrative experience, and he is unable to give shaikh Abdullah any useful advice on the subject. The new Inspector is a very useful man and will be of great value, but, suffers like all ' lebanicans 1 from too great an admixture of .i est em ideas. His introduction of English into the lowest forms was a mistake which has been rectified, and as he is daily gain- -ing the confidence of the public much may be hoped from him. 6. The great mistake in Bahrain, as in India, has been to educate the few at the expense of the many. I asked Belgrave a question about the number of small Koran schools, and found that he knew nothing about them. Since we have a number^ i jiumbor oi th©s6 littio schools attuched to mo^^u©s and waqfS| it ia obviously our policy to find thoni out and ©ncourag© thea^ to organise themselves into more efficient bodies# This will be much siiapler now that the Shiah Waqfs are under a committee and as the inspect r becomes better known I think they Y/ould cooperate with hinu It is of course natural, though a great mistake| to prefer to spend money on a school where some spectacular re ult con be obtained such as two boys reciting in broken .English a ridiculous dialogue about Alexander and a slave j but I hope that the older, and to my mind more im or tan t, schools will now receive encouragement ♦ 7# The higher administrative posts that you mention are very few in number and since they will have to be filled , if at all, by members of the A1 Khalifa, I am dealing with the in a separate letter# There is f however , a real need for boys to train as surveyors school masters and clerks and as 10K, as our schools are in their present rotten condition we cannot educate thai locally. I have suggested to Belgrave that he shou d ae ;d few clever boys to Van Ess school in Basrah, which wiU cost a fraction of keeping them at Beirut, and produce much better results. This would cost far less than as a natter establishing a real secondary school here, for which fSffXMIte of fact we could not find the boys, and being so close they will be under better supervision. I do not consider that the fact that the Van Sss school is a missionary enterprise will be an obstacle, for Beirut University was until recently the Syrian Protestant College, and it is well knovan that Van Ess gives much better supervision thim obtains there. This suggestion will probably be acted upon if we can find the right boys. 8. To sum up. A real secondary school HXMhMIipX is badly needed in Bahrain, but the State cannot afford it at present. A substitute may be made by sending a few boys to Basrah. The Schools require reorganisatioKthroughout, and this us gradually being done.

Until this- year there has been a steady increase in revenue but the present year, as you know,is an exceptionally bad one mainly owing to the slump on the pearl market and I expect to end the year with a very much smaller balance than las.t year and a decrease of about one lac on laat years revenue. This is a very big deficit when one considers the smallness of the whole revenue. Our expenditure has been heavy too owing to the. payments for the electric scheme most of which have been paid this year. Unless a sudden and very unlikely change takes place on the pearl market L expect the financial position, at all events for the first half of the next year, will be even worse than this year. With one. or two exceptions none of the Bahrain men have sold their pearls and the financing of the boats, which will take place in a week or two, is usually done out of the first instalment of the payments for the last season's pearl sales. As-practically no instalments are now forthcoming there is going to be serious trouble at Rekba. The tajaas are already urging the Government . to reduce the advances to the lowest possible amount. Last time when a slight reduction was made there were riots in the bazaar. I disagree with your opinion that the Customs has suffered from lack of a programme. Large and expensive works have been carried out to the improvement of the Customs in the last four years. The import shed has been re-roofed, the docks and jetty on the east of the main pier have been built and all the intervening ground has been reclaimed besides numerous less conspicious works. All this has cost not less than a lac. I discussed the future requirements of the Customs with de Grenier before he left. He made the fallowing suggestions, f 1. Purchase of a five ton. crane. This, as he pointer out would benefit the Landing Company perhaps more than anyone else. He suggested that we should invite them to contribute to the cost of the crane. I dont think they will have any wish to do this. 2. Removal of trolley line to the lane between Customs and Zayanis to prevent the Court being disturbed by noise. I think this is unnecessary if only for this reason, he also said it would be safer as there is no traffic in the side street. 3. Extension of the pier out to deep water. In his opinion this wiould cost not less than three lacs. 4. Purchase of a weighing stand. 5. M launch. 6. Construction of a roofed iron shed on the pier beyond the Pier shed, to protect cargo from rain. 7. Purchase of a supply of new tarpaulins. I am making allowance in the new Budget for items 1. 4.5.and 7.that is to say if funds are available. While the Muharrak Sea Road scheme is on hand there will be no funds available for extension of the pier, at least for several years. The pier extension is the most important suggestion in this list but I do not think myself that it would be what you refer to in your letter as productive expenditure. Personally I do not think that it wauld increase trade. L I entirely agree that agriculture on a fairly large scale would be a most valuable improvement, especially as a substitute to diving which is an uncertain quantity. The only difficulty would be to obtain people to take it up. Ho Arabs go in for agriculture in Bahrain. i he agriculturists are the Baharna and anumber of imported Hassawis. The Arabs here, as a whole, are extremly lazy, except for diving they do no manual labour, all the coolies and others, as well as masons, painters and carpenters are foreigners. If a sort of allotment system .on a large scale was started I think it would be very popular with the Baharna iaai who would certainly co-operate, but the, JChaXifa. w.oiil4 Jiot, encourage such schemes and the Arabs would not be interested, they might even be actively against it if their possible tenants left them to work independently^as they certainly would. . One of the few apparently likely areas for such an experiment, which is not claimed by one o£ the Ruling family, is the old landing Ground and the surrounding area. There are a number of villages quite close to this place. I have talked, about it t,© some of the Bahama and the idea seems very popular. i K As you know I never was in favour of sending boys to -^eyrout. At the end of this tern we propose to withdraw all but the three .sons of Shaikhs. The whole programme of the schools is to be revised as well but at present the schools are best left alone. A loan this year for the Muharrak Sea -^oad is not possible. I sounded, various people on the subject. When talking to them I also discovered that/ they seemed to expect the same rate of interest that is current here, that is 20^. Personally I have never pushed the road scheme but it is so universally popular and ^he Skaikh himself is so keen on it, that finally 1 started the work. We are now calling for tenders for the filling in of the walled spaces which we have made. One of the greatest advantages is that the money eventually returns into, the country as most of the cost is the price of stones supplied by local boats. One of my difficulties is that except Mohamed Khalil I have nooody to take charge of the work and he has quite as much as he can do air eady. A start in child welfare has been made by the appointment of a municipal midwife in Muharrak. I should be glad to discuss these things with you before making the next budget which I shall start on next month, but until we know exactly how we stand financially it is difficult to settle what, to start on. If oil is found it would be possible to do a very great deal more than is being done now. ^ .. ' \ ' ' .

I5.B.10) Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 112 of April 5th transmitting a copy of an enquiry fron His Majesty^ principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the possibility of recruiting Sudanese for the police force of the State of Bahrein. 2. The Sudan Government would have no objection on political grounds to this proposal, but I think it desirable to make abundantly clear from the outset that in my view there is not the slightest chance that recruits will be forthcoming. 3. The far distance of Bahrein from the Sudan, the dislike of the Sudanese for service outside their own country, the case with which good wages may be earned in the Sudan and the existence there of immense tracts available for cultivation, render it most improbable that any natives would consider service abroad as a substitute preferable to work in tneir own natural environment. I may add that it is not always easy to obtain recruits for the police forces of the Sudan itself. 4. If the pay offered were very high, it is just possiole that a few more adventurous spirits might be disposed to regard the proposal with favour, but 1 confess that it is unlikely that they would be of the type needed for a police force. I have, however, no information as to the terms of service offered. 5.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Es iuire, Adviser, Bahrain Government Bahrain.The Agency, Bahrain. 24tii July / /) t ^ /voc t Are you irrevocably committed to thia scheme of a searchlight on a 75 foot ojple on the end of the pier.? I cannot disguise my opinion that it is a colossal waste of moneyt and I cannot understand how de Grenier managed to get it past your unyielding control of the public purse• I have never understood its object for everytime I attempted to extract information from de Grenier he gave me a different answer# Sometimes he told me that it was to he a light to vesselfi trying to make the outer huoy t and he would run through a little lightning calculation as to how far out to sea a 75 five foof light would he viwible* I told him that for all intents and purposes the light was 13 miles the wrong side of the outer buoy, and that the dangerous moment for ships was when they were leaving the ten fathom line and that by the time they had made the outer buoy they would be safe. This superlight woulfl not I think be visible a yard further than the outer buoy and in the slightest haze would not be visible at all* He would then say that it could be twisted about so as to show a light for vessels coming from Qatif# The essen tial point of a light once it is put on a chart is that should not be moved without warningt a d with such a concentrated beam as the searchlights proposed will have the smallest de viation would affest their visibility* I do not think the Q,atif traffic needs anything better th n^now existsi and cer tainly not a 25 00/- light. Then both he and you have told me that much money would be saved by a second light being th(^rwn back on the pier and so doing av;ay with the necessity of further lights. Apart from the fact that a deep shadow will be thrown by the customs shed, you will find that no one has any desire to work in the blinding glare of a searchlight, and I am sure every-one will ask to have it turned off. If the lights used are those t at Jordan turned on one day I am certain this will be the case, as they blinded me when I drove rqy car into them the night the power was turned on* You have probably experienced yourself how blinding the searchlight of a ship or military unit is during night work, and these will be Just as disagreeable. Further I should imagiae that the people in the town behind the pier light will complain of the glare* The whole plan contains s ch a misconception of both hrabour lighting and flood lighting for wharves that I wish you had given me an opportunity of expressing an opinion before the scheme was taken up, particularly since both you and de Grenier appear quite unfamiliar with these types of lightning. It is a mistake to imagine that because de Gre .ie is called a Port Officer that he understands anything about the duties of one, and he certainly never had any authority to approach B .I. skippers or anyone else regarding such ascheme. The only people whose opinion would carry weight would be thos&lt; of the O^T.O. and the Marine Superintendent of the B«I. and possibly the Officer in char e of the lighting and buoying,, W? ^Youra sincerely ^ COi I think you will have realised by now that Jordan's views are not reliable when it comes to selling plant and that his principal consideration is to sell stuff first and leave you to discover whether it is really required or not# /') &lt; C30th July 1930. Dear BeIgrave * I send you the charts with a word of explanation. If you will look at ktMh 2837b you will see that I have mark ed in two little circles conncentrioally from the eotimtaed position of the proposed light. The inner circle is 10 miles and the ouer one 20 miles from Bahrain. Steamers almost invariably approach Bahrain from the direction of the y that I have made whether they are going dowb or up gulf. The dangerous moment for them is when they leave the ten fathom line to make the oueftr buoy # and the small circle on this 13 fathom line is where Marr said a light was most required, and failing this one on the lasht Aobal. You will see that you will need to tfjun your concentrated be m exactly over Muharraq to assist them at all, and that to be of any use it must outshine the ouetr buoy. You will notice that the outer buoy gets a consider ible start of the proposed light, in faot Bahrain is absolutely invisible from the outer buoy or in fact from any where in this V more than seven miles from the^light* I personally think the Mu~ harraq buildings and palms would prove a serious obstacle even if the weather remained absol-0ately clear which is unlikely. I think you would get as good an effect by putting the light in the minaret and not necessarily fo cussing it in the direction of the V, so that it would give some light in the harbour. It would however be of no use in get .ing a fix in Bahrain harbour itsljef, as a ship about to anchor in t the outer anchorage would be almost directly between the two &lt; lights and so unable to to use their angles to place themselves on the chart. The problem is one on which the views of the B-'T.O. or some similar person would be more useful than the amateur expressions of myself Ifir Telegram. I.W.Code. Prom- PRIOR, KARACHI.

The reduction will not take place immediately, but as the men's contracts expire only selected men will be kept on until the required fixgure is reached.

This part of the volume contains letters exchanged between the Political Agent in Bahrain (Major Clive Daly until September 1926, thereafter Major Cyril Barrett) and the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Trevor or the Acting Resident Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart Knox until April 1924, thereafter Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux), and the Political Resident and the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India. British officials discussed proposals for economic and political reforms in Bahrain, with particular attention paid to tax changes intended to redress the imbalance between what Bahrain's Sunnis and Shias were obliged to pay. Also discussed were the financial reorganisation of the customs house and regulation of the pearl diving industry, reform of the Bahrain judicial system, land registration and revenues, and the institution of a Levy Corps force. British officials also discussed the relationships between themselves and between members of the al Khalifa ruling family, in particular Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa and his son Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The abdication or removal of Isa, and the installation of Hamad, are discussed at length.The last part of the volume (folio 147 onwards) spans the period 1929-1930, and is chiefly comprised of correspondence between the Bahrain Agent (Colonel Geoffrey Prior), Political Resident (Barrett to November 1929, thereafter Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Biscoe) and officials from the Government of India. This part of the volume concerns fears on the part of the Government of India that Britain is too heavily involved in Bahrain, and asks questions of whether the number of British officials in Bahrain can be reduced. Included are two lengthy reports by Prior and Barrett in June and August 1929 respectively (folios 147-162, 165-185) outlining Britain's historic intervention in Bahrain, and stressing the importance of its continued presence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Deposition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00035e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
