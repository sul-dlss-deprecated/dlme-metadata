Special Powers Law of 4.5.43 -oCopy No. 955/5/43 BRITISH LEGATION TEHRAN. 10th June, 194b Dear Consulate/Consulate-General, Attached is a Summary of the Law of 13 Ordibehesht, 1322 (4th May, 1943), which confers special powers on the Director- General of Finance (Dr. A.C. Millspaugh) in regard to the control of prices, rents and wages. 2. Appendix A. to the Summary gives in tabular form a paraphrase of each of the Regulations made by the Director-General of Finance under the Special Powers Law that had been published up to and including 9th June, 1943. Addenda to Appendix A. will be issued from time to time as further regulations are published. / 3. With reference to Regulation No. 3, His Majesty*s Legation informed the Persian Government that it could not regard His Majesty’s Government as bound by these provisions, which, in their present form, might seriously embarrass the British military authorities. We, at the same time, expressed our willingness to enter into a workable arrangement acceptable to both parties. Negotiations which have taken place have established the position that, while lists of expected purchases during the succeeding six months will be sent to the Price Stabilisation Section, these lists will be in the nature of estimates, and will not bind the military authorities to those specific quantities.

I '' (ii- Your telegram No.643. ’{clfur' \ I appreciate the unsoundness of lending sterling to cover an internal budget deficit, and I assume United States Government if they were prepared in principle to lend at all would have similar objections. Nevertheless if Persia is to be saved from financial and economic collapse during the present year, some way round the d;*.fiiculty must be lounu. You will realise that the proposals made in paragraph 5 oi my telegram No. 701 under which Persia would obtain: (a) An immediate loan of the equivalent of 500 million rials to cover the grain purchase scheme, and (b) An advance on 1943/44 royalties, ^ do no more| if accepted, than see her through her difficulties up to end of the next Persian month (i.e. to August 2dnd). Oil royalties advance is now apparently well in train and ii His Majesty*s Government (with or without United States participation) will grant a shortJerm credit of 500_ million rials, these two expediences will at least give us several weeks to explore a long term arrangement, lor fuller information on the situation (see s letter to Mr.Kershaw No.809/59/43) despatched by fant oag on July 4th). 2 . Your paragraphs 2 and 3,'There would be no difficulty about getting any agreement for a short term e r edi ^ counter signed by Dr.Mill 5 ^n{^and it can be arranged that credit will be used only for purchase of harvest. There are however difficulties (which will be apparent from leoter aooye mentioned) in the way of Persian Government undertaking repayment in rials to be used fov our military expenditure at all events earlier than the beginning of next financial I suggest however that short term credit should be securedfinj oil royalties accruing during 1944 / 45 .and.repaid during that financial year either in sterling or in rials but not more rapidly than oil royalties accrue. 3. There is one point to be remembered both in relation to a short term credit and to larger loan. Credit would be used to back an additional note issue.

In any event Director General made a condition of the agreement that repayment of advance should be made in gold (if you wanted it) to the same extent as if the advance itself had in fact been made in gold. 4.

DEDIP MOST SECRET My telegram N o. 714. Following is report of a confidential conversation yesterday between Millsja^and Iliff. In a recent discussion with the Prime Minister on the financial situation M. has emphasised the immediate need for external help. The Prime Minister has replied that he WDUld be obliged to refuse either purely British aid or even joint British/Araerican help. M. has replied that if the Prime Minister would not accept at le ast a joint British/American loan he would probably receive no help at all, because in his (M's) judgment United States Government would certainly be unwilling to play the role of sole benefactor. c l » ' 2, Iliff suggested that S’s hesitation might be due to_anxiety about Russian reactions, but M. said ho thought this was less in S's mind than the probable reaction cf Majlis. 3. M. said he knew (repeat knew) the Soviets would not either themselves come to xhe rAue or associate with Great Britain and the United States or either of them in a joint loan. 4. M. also said he i s preparing a secret memorandum for British and United States Legation on financial and economic relations of the Soviets with Persia during the last two years. This memorandum will, he says, be factual and embody neither comment nor conclusions but will supply evidence to support his firm conviction that Russian policy In this country is based on the desirability of at least doing nothing to retard financial and economic collapse of the existing Persian State, and at most doing everything to hasten it.

Are you yet in a position to indicate the attitude of His Majesty’s Government and/or United States Government to a request for a short term credit of the equivalent of 500,000,000 rials (see my paragraph 1 (a))? 2 . I should he grateful also to learn whether the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. are likely to give a favourable answer to a request from the Persian Government for an advance against royalties (see my paragraph 1 (b)) 3, As regards long-term arrangements, I think it is desirable that Iliff should be in London while the project is under discussion with the United States Embassy and the Soviets. He will be in a position to give you the background of the financial situation and I should be very sorry if Millspaugh's application were refused or too long aelayed because either you or United States Embassy had not been fully informed of all the circumstances. Very grave issues are at stake in this financial crisis and if you agree Iliix would be of use in London. £ocal arrangements for sale ol gold which are well in train should take second place. Accordingly I suggest that Iliff should travel to Cairo by air on July 7th.' If you agree, perhaps Cairo will arrange for his rapid onward transportation. 4.

Following is best appreciation that Iliff is able to report on the- facls- available. (a) Ev£n M. is not in a position to give an accurate assessment of the situation and s^ys now that a loan of 1,000 million rials to • -balance this year’s budget igrp. undec. ? will not be] enough. (b) Government’s cash position.may shortly become critical. They have met with difficulty their obligations for Persian month ended to-day and this partly by sale of their rapidly diminishing free foreign exchange. It now seems likely however that without some • external help they will have to default on next month’s payments on perhaps a serious &lt; scale. Governor of National Bank says he. is able to lend the Government only an additional 1 70 million rials. (c) Sherida*.without informing Millspaugh, altered his wheat collection policy to include a sfcaeme of payment in advance of delivery of contracted purchases. This has thrown Millspaugh’s estimate completely awry.J . • • * 4. \ ►4 (d) Millspaugh had been estimating that for next two months at least Ministry of Food would be self-supporting but he now says they need 500 million rials 'immediately' to finance Sherwfcvs scheme. (e) Millspaugh proposed to Iliff to-day that Anglo-I rani an Oil Company should be approached by Persian Government to make available [grp- undec. ? 4] million pounds .o within the next fortnight as an advance payment of royalties. He suggested ear marking this for grain purchase scheme (see (3) above.). • (f) When Iliff expressed some doubt .whether this arrangement would in the light of (b) above.solve the immediately threatened crisis, Millspaugh agfeed it would not and he has called a meeting of his advisers tomorrow morning to consider this aspect. (g) Millspaugh says he' could accept an advance from the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company without going to the Majlis but the latter s consent would be necessary before he could accept a foreign loan, even a short-term advance. He was reluctant to present a loan project to the Majlis unless conditions are attached to it by the lenders that will ensure [? grp. omtd.] enactment of his taxation proposals. He fears that if the Majlis, thought the Allies might be willing to lend unconditionally, deputies would be . dilatory about passing/questions of)legislation. (h) It Seems nevertheless that if grain purchase scheme (to which Sherlaa^is now sotfar committed that it cannot be altered) is to go on and, if some other.essential public services are to escape paralyse 1 alert, the Government must have an advance within the next few weeks from somewhere to an amount probably of the equivalent of 700 or 800 million rials to carry them over the period while the long-term arrangements are discussed. 3. If our suspicions are confirmed that the actual situation is as I have outlined it above, Iliff's suggestion is that we and/or the Americans should lend at once the equivalent of 500 million rials to be earmarked for grain purchase scheme (even if it means going to the Majlis) ana that the Government should'borrow what they can from the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company under a sub-rosa arrangement, using the prcceeds to finance their commit/irfit^^ over the next few months on services other than Ministry of Food.

As I have already pointed out in ray telegram No. 483 Millspaugh is faced with a deficit in current year of at leasx i , 5 u(j million rials. Lending capacity of National Bank (to whom Government already owe 3,750 million rials) is limited to 50 million rials. The problem is from what source can the remaining 1,000 million rials be found, for if it is not found either collection of the harvest will be endangered or if that is to be first priority other vital Government services will become paralysed for want of funds, or both. 2.. As i mentioned in paragraph 4 of mv telegram No. 491 the money might be found by amending [? 10 grps. omitted] which - formerly prevailed under which notes yere printed, without cover, simply on the authorisation of the Majlis. This, however, is the very last course that I should recommend because (a) it would put currency supply again in the hands of the Majlis and you v/ill not have forgotten the embarrassment for us which that arrangement entailed, and (b) it means an uncontrolled inflation. Millspaugh is opposed to this solution. /3. ... r&lt;n&gt; ~ tSppg% t m r /6. «.. 2 3* There remains therefore, I think, only the alternative of an Allied loan which would provide necessary foreign y exchange ^for an additional issue of currency. This too would be inflatory but controlled at least by the extent of the Allies 1 willingness to lend. Millspaugh would prefer a straight American dollars credit but he says that a joint Anglo-American advance would be acceptable' to him and probably acceptable to Persian-Government. He does not (repeat not) think Soviet'participation would either be feasible or desirable from the standpoint of Persian interests. He fears discussion of Soviet participation would result only in waste of time, a result which he thinks might be welcomed and connived at by the Soviets themselves. ‘ ‘ 1 Sherkiaiy.'s latest estimate of maximum additional credit he needs this year is 300 million rials. Y/hile collection of .wheat crop must be our first concern, I do not think limitation of financial assistance to this object only is a solution. The collection of the crop depends not only on.the money being available to pay for it but also on the* maintenance of vital public services e.g. transport, security and the Government machine' itself. If these collapse for want of funds, the crop collection will collapse too. Nevertheless a short-tem credit by His Majesty’s Government would certainly ease the position while longer tem arrange ments were being discussed and obviate the possibility of crop collection being jeopardised for want of funds. 5. My recommendation would therefore be that: (a) a dollar and/or sterling credit equivalent of 1,000 million rials should be made available to the Persian Govern ment of which 500 million rials would be ear-marked for purchase of the wheat crop. (b) Soviet Government should be informed of the prevailing situation., given an opportunity of participating but evidence of unwillingness on their part to join would not deter the . United States Government or oiiirselves from making the advance. (c) If negotiations with regard to (a) and (b) are likely to be protracted, either His Majesty’s Government or the United States Government or both Governments jointly should at once make an advance equivalent of 500 million rials to be ear-marked for purchase of the wheat crop.3211 - 3 - $ 6 # ; My United States colleague infoims me in confidence that he has telegraphed State Department recommending as his personal opinion that an advance should he made on the lines proposed by Millspaugh* &lt;?&gt; Meanwhile^ Millspaugh has sent another letter to the United States Minister answering the comment of State Department and United States Treasuiy on his proposals.

Killspaugh points out that to bring about a reversal of this policy would take a long time. 4 6 . He continues, ’’you should keep in mind that the Persian Government is supplying Soviets with 8 a million rials a month under Financial agreement.

Dear Mr. Dreyfus, I want to present to you the outstanding general facts of the financial crisis and suggest certain lines along which the Allies, particularly the unites Spates, may be of help to Iran in this situation. I have come to the conclusion that, unless this help is given and given quickly we may face very soon a further serious deterioration and probably the collapse o organized government in this country. Wjuit such an eventuality would mean to the Allies is doubtless fully understood by them. While the Financial Mission has been in Iran less than three months and this period is too short for demonstrat ing any large accomplishments, I believe that we have done cer tain things; (1) given a degree of strength and consistency to the policies of the Government, (2) made definite pp^greas in reorganising the financial administration, (3) established a measurable control over expenditures, (4) formulated a comprehensive and sound program for dealing with the economic and financial situation, and (ft) obtained, as you know, the adoption by the Government of a part of this program. 'Hie immediate crisis has three main causes: (1) inflation, resulting in an increase of general princes by about seven times during the last seven years, (2) the food crisis, and (3) the situation of the Governments budget and its financial obligations. With respect to this third factor, I may say that the Government before our arrival had borrowed heavily from the National Bank. 'The total debt of the Government to the Bank is now over 3 000 000 000 rials. The Government borrowed over 1 000 000 000 rials last year, and left a large number of claiis unpaid. Some of these are in sub stantial amounts. The financial practices of the Government and the results were duplicated on a smaller scale by practically all the municipalities, many of which are now2 In most straitened circumstances. Due to the disorder in the country, the dis organization in the financial aoministration, and the prevailing corruption, the revenues suffered last year a serious decrease. The expenditures, on the other hand, showed an increase, due partly to overstaffing and extravagance and partly to an increase of salaries necessitated by the rise of prices, as well as to an increase In the costs of supplies. The Government was no doubt contributing to the inflationary spiral through its borrowing and spending. ihrou&lt; h its monopolies, factories, and other enterprises, the Iranian Government Is a large-scale purchaser and seller of commodities. In audition to its ordinary governmental expenditures, therefore it requires large amounts for the purchase of foodstuffs and raw materials. At^ the present moment we are asked to supply 645 000 000 rials for the purchase of cereals during the first three months, 310 000 000 rials for the purchase of materials for the munitions factories under contract to the Russians, 100 000 000 rials for a canning factory, also under contract to the Russians, 46 000^000 rials for the purchase of cotton, and 200 000 000 rials for opium purchases. We have asked a credit for a revolving fund of 100 000 000 rials for the administration of price-fixing, most of which we shall need If priae-fixlng is to be enforced in a manner that ;s adapted to this cour try and likely to be effective. The amounts required by the factories under contract to the Russians may be considerably reducer:; and it Is, of course, to be noted that, during a longer or shorter period, much of the expenditure in all of these categories will come back to the Government. In addition to these partially self-liquidating obligations, we have a promise by the Government to the Khouzlstan Agricultural society of 100 000 000 rials. I understand that the British have already advanced certain sums for this undertaking. We have a debt which I understand to be around 50 000 000 rials for trucks bought under the lend- lease arrangement with the United States Government, unless conditions greatly chaiige, we may expect a deficit in the ordinary budget (exclusive of the obligations mentioned above) of around 600 000 000 rials. Finally, the Ministry of War asks that its budget be increased by an amount of 520 000 000 rials. We are putting into effect, have proposed, or are proposing various measures. Including the price-fixing project, /a project3 a project lor a treasury-bond issue, an income-tax law, sale of government properties, sale of government diamonds, sale of gold and silver, encouragement of savings, and restriction of credits by the banks. Two measures suggest themselves as a means to reduce Government borrowing; (1) reduction of expenditures and obligations and (2) increase of revenues. With reference to the possibility of reducing expenditures and obligations, it is evident that the self- liquidating or partially self-liquidating expen itures mention ed above cannot be greatly reduced or even in large part postponed without (1) serious social repercussions, (2) a loss of revenue, (3) loss of control over prices (as in the case of grain, cottony and price-fixing operations), or (4) vidation of contractual obligations. The deficit In the ordinary budget of the Government and the mea^res that can be applies to it call for somewhat fuller explanation; and in the course of this explanation I shall try to make clear why I think the further deterioration and eventual coll^se of organized government in Iran are distinct probabilities* ihe actual effectiveness of government and its stability depend on the character of the leaders and high officials and on the ef Iciency of the rank and file of the lower employees* T: o needed leaders^hip is almost completely lacking, although there are mary high officials of competence ana integrity. The demoralization and corruption among the lower officials and employees are almost unbelievable; and both the demoralization and corruption are largely attribu table to the rise of prices and the corresponding decrease of real salaries and wages* I am receiving every day pitiable petitions from employees, who say truly that their compensation is below a living wage. During the last few days I have received word that financial employees have left work or are threatening to leave work at Isfahan, Ghom and zanjan. We have had a strike among our tobacco employees; another, on the part of the Mint laborers. Engineers of the mines and factories are still oufc. At least one attempted suicide has been rep r ted to me. Many of our best employees have quit. Many of the others are so dispirited, resentful, or preoccupied with their living that they render llotle or no service, still others are known to be stealing. With such a personnel, it is evident that we cannot expect success in tax-collection or price- fixing. goon after my arrival, I demanded a drastic reduc tion o: the ordinary budget, and, since then, I have made some progress along this line. it seemed to me imperative thatthose employees who are useless or superfluous or who aro kept on the payroll solely because they are needy should be cut out. Such action Is requlreu to restore a modicum of operating efficiency to the Government* under present circ unstances, however, two necessities must be faced: (1) that many of the dismissed employees must be paid or fed until they find other work, and (2) t e remaining employees must be given increased salaries. Unless this program is carried out, I am satisfied that wo cannot save the situation by the major measures of price-fixing and taxation. On the contrary, the revenues that we depend upon to cover the deficit cannot be collected and a continued increase of prices will render salaries and wages progressively more inadequate. The situation of the employees, therefore, demands that we give increases at once in the more urgent cases. Altogether it is evident that during the first fow months of this year, the dedeit in the ordinary budget will bo greater, not less* The only hope of reducing it will be throat h an improvea morale of the employees and the cuccosstul aoministration of our price—fixing and tax programs* The increase asked by the Ministry of War is largely justified on the basis of increased prices, necessitating, as in civil ministries, increased pay if efficiency is to be , t aintained or restored* Xn addition, the Army is a la ‘ge buyer of fodder and supplies, tho prices of which have increased. The total rejection of the Amy’s demand for an increase in its budget would require the reduction of the Army from its present reported strength of 90 000 to a strength of probably not more than 50 000. I am not prepared to attempt to compel such a decrease; and I have felt justified in agreeing to an increase of 300 000 000 rials. Instead of the 520 000 000 rials demanded• The lending capacity of the National Bank is limited this year to an amount of 500 OOo 000 rials. This limit is fixed by the expected supply of rial notes. It is impossible to estimate with any precision tho amount that we shall have to borrow in excess of tax revenues; but, taking everything roughly into consideration, I believe that we shall need at le*ist 1 000 000 000 rials in addition to the 500 000 000 which we expect to borrow from the National Bank. The lack of this 1 000 000 000 rials, particularly now during the next five months, will moan an actual stoppage of payments in very considerable amounts, and, to the extent that this stoppage affects salaries and wages, it will mean the further deterior ation of the Government and its eventual collapse. This process will be hastened by the blow to the prestige of the American financial M ssion which would come fr:m a 'failure to •»./make payments- 5 - 2757 make payments to employees already underpaid. In view of tills crisis, I am preusiTrr iWr-the 43 Nri«ia tries to reduce their budgets; I am refusing to approve payments for purposes which seem to me unnecessary; I have given orders that every payment that car be postponed shall be postponed; and I have* written to the prime Minister proposing; priorities in the making of payments. May I submit a request now to your Legation and through it to the United States Government and, if you/ approve, to the other Allied Governmorts row in Iran? request Is to give us help (1) by reducing your expenditures in the country, (2) by bringing in .old ana silver for the purchase of rials to meet your requirements, (3) by permitting larger quantities of goods to be Imported into the country, (4) by paying the Iranian taxes (especially the customs duties) when you are not clearly exempted from such taxes, (5) by not paying wages above the wage-scale of the country, (6) by not soliciting or acceptin the employment of Iranians now in the Government service, (7) by helping to prevent the exportation of essential commodities from Iran, (8) by revising contracts which place a burden on the Iranian Treasury (for example, the mu ItIons contracts) and (9) by permitting the Iranian Government to postpone payments on obligations due to the Allies eovernnents (for example, the dobt for lend-lease trucks). Such cooperation I air confident will be forthcoming and it will be of substantial assistance; but It will hot be sufficient to solve the problem, even though the Iranian Government does Its full part, as I hope It will. Wo need an emergency loan from the Allies in an amount of at least 1 000 000 000 rials; and I hope that this loan will be given by the Unite. States Government or jointly by the united states and British Governments. It is true that the loan will be inflationary, but such effect appears to me to be the least of the possible dangers that are imminent. I would suggest that the loan mi ht bo for a period extending to one year after the ena of the present war. In ray opinion, it might Sp well be conditioned oh the maintenance o an American financial Mission in Iran headed by an Administrator General of the Finances possessing the powers now possessed by me.

Assessments for income tax are grouped under three schedules. (1) Industrial and commercial profits etc. (2) Salaries (3) Profits from non-commercial professions e.g. doctors. 3. Under schedules (1) and (2) taxable income is the net income and the scale is as follows: up to 2,400 rials exempt. From 2,401 to 5.000 at l/o. From 5,001 to 20,000 at 3/t&gt;. From 20,001 to 40.000 at 6/o, From 40,001 to 100,000 at 10/o. From 100,001 to 500,000 at 15/o. From 500,000 and upwards at 20/o. 4. Schedule (2). Tax on salaries is payable monthly and is deductible by employer. It is assessed without regard to marital status or number of dependants. The examples: 800 rials a month tax 14,5 rials (about £200 a year) 79.5 rials: &gt;0 a year) 587.5 rials: 16,000 rials 1,716 rials: 100,000 rials (about ) rials.. . 5. Inheritance duty consists of legacy duty only: there is no estate duty in the British sense. Legacy duty is payable on a scale which varies with relationship and amount of legacy. The lowest tax is 1/6: the highest 15 c /o. The yield of inheritance duty for^last fiscal year was estimated at a figure representing 1/6 of the total direct taxation. following are typical rials monthly: 2 ? 200 7,500 rials (abou'G £7 (about £1,500 a year) £10,000 a year) 17,20•J -r.

The above,gives sone details of the system of direct taxation in Persia at present in force; but Millspaugh will shortly present to the Majlis the budget for the current year and it is understood that he will propose steep increases in income tax and possibly a heavy duty on private motor cars.

I think that ,we must accept Imlspaugh's appreciation of^ present serious financial situation in Persia. 2. While major factors have been (a) Allied v/ar expenditure and (b) W^sound budgetary finance, difficulties of the successive governments have been much increased by general disturbance of economic life in consequence of the war, by lack of a trained Civil Service sufficient in numbers and of a calibre competent to deal with unprecedented problems of the day, and by financial burdens which Soviet policy in this country has placed upon Persia’s feeble shoulders, for example onerous munition factories.department. 3. As regards help that Millspaugh asks for from Allied Governments which I summarised in paragraph 8 of my telegram _N£»..4B3have been considering the extent to which His Majesty's Government might make some contribution. (a) our military authorities have already, I assume, satisfied themselves that expenditure in Persia is kept at minimum consistent with our Lgip). undec. ? old] commitments. I note that Minister of State proposes to go into this question further with C.-in-C© But it must not be forgotten that part at least of our military expenditure (e.g. on road maintenance and on railway) while ultimately inflationary has brought direct relief to Persian budget. • ' • - ~ wy | » m* **• M | • ej &lt; ? jf y. ! INDIA FFiOSl- 2 - (b) we cannot, I suppose, undertake to do more than proceed with our experimental sale of gold but I would press for immediate despatch of the bullion. Anyhow, if this proposal were adopted in toto I do not see how it would help to relieve immediate budget difficulties. (c) Minister of State is, I understand, exploring I the’ possibilities of increasing the flow of imports. Perhaps some further relief may be expected from India through encouraging dhow traffic and free importation of 'gur' (a species of sugar). Nevertheless in view of general shipping and supplies situation we can scarcely undertake to do much under this heading. (d) this I think is aimed at the Soviets who it fs reported are not paying customs duties on all goods they import and I should be surprised if they paid duties on anything they take out. Our own position in .this matter cannot I think be impeached. Substantially we have .claimed exemption from taxation only as regards customs import duties on military stores and on consignments imported by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation on military account (e.g. trucks, tyres and spare parts for supplies to Russian transport fleet). (e) and (f) These are addressed I think to the Americans more than to us but in any case we might give assurances, on these points and see that instructions are issued to our military authorities and to British agencies in the [grp. undec. ?]eg United Kingdom Commercial Corporation to conform. (g) this is addressed principally to the Soviet practice of buying foodstuffs and also I think to us for (1) exporting vegetables for army and (2) not doing more to prevent smuggling of wheat to Iraq. (hj this also is a remonstrance against Soviet 'policy, (j) I leave this to be dealt with by United States Government but there is something to be said for it. A. As regards proposal for an Allied loan, Millspaugh makes it I presume as the only expedient open to him to make both ends of the current year { s budget meet. It is a counsel of depair but if he cannot cut expenditure further, cannot-raise anything more by taxation and can borrow only a. limited amount internally, what other course is open to him but to print money needed without the cover that a foreign loan would afford. This I regard as the last expedient. 5. In his telegram under reference the Minister of State has described the gloomy situation in Persia. There is one improvement since then in that the Majlis have passed essential clause of Millspaugh Powers Bill and will probably pass the rest soon. It is probably for this reason that rise in prices has halted and that prices have even fallen in some cases but the Majlis have lost several weeks in debate and allowed the situation to/A -3- 235 [ 1943 PR, to deteriorate. liillspaugh is ill and [grp. undec. ? pessimistic] and has insufficient staff to enforce fully the powers which we hope he will get. He has ready Income Tax Bill with rates rising to 80% but even if the Hajlis passes this quickly we should have considerable time before it begins to bring in large sums contemplated. It is to Soheily s credit that he has supported iiillspaugh so far but he and the army are suspicious of le ach other, the t ri bes/thej^-keteg- upper hand in Bakhtiari _ ar ^[ fa a Y e not been redtfded to order in Pars where Shah{-grp. rnidco.Jkhti is sulking and the otherwise happy prospect of a bumper harvest everywhere is marred by delay in putting into force the ill-conceived plan devised by the Government for collecting surplus. The Persians are an ungrateful people and anything one does for them is hampered by slackness, corruption and malice but we are partly responsible for the unhappy condition of this country and if we can help them we ought to do so.

A*’!* [Summary begins], Millspaugh has cornerto the conclusion that unless allied help to solve financial crisis is forthcoming quickly we may very soon face the collapse of organised Government in Persia. 2. The crisis has three main causes (a) inflation, (b) food situation, (c) Government's unhealthy budgetary situation. 3. As regards (c) M. estimates a deficit in current year's ordinary budget of 600 million rials. ' In addition he has to find 300 million increase for the army (Ministry of War has demanded 520 million). f . ■ 4-. He must also find 64-5 million during the first three Vo( ^^ months for the purchase of wheat crop, 300 million for Russian munition factories, see my telegram No.89.^ 100 million for canning factory (also for the Russians)7 4-6 million for purchase of cotton, 200 million for purchase of opium, 100 million for our Khuzistan wheat growing project and a revolving fund of 100 million for his price fixing scheme. Much of this expenditure will come back sooner op later to the Government. There is also a debt of about 50 million for trucks obtained from United States Government under lease-lend. 5. 'The demoralisation and corruption amongst lower officials and employees are almost unbelievable; and both the demoralisation and corruption are largely due to rise of prices and corresponding decrease of real salaries and wages'. He proposes to dismiss all redundant civil servants but is faced with the necessity of granting substantial increases to those who are retained, in RECD.

W ithout an increase in the army budget it would be necessai^(ferr^diGS3i l patit&gt;n'''Ofjthe strength of the army. He feels * unable to attempt to compel such a cut and feels justified in agreeing to increase of 300 million in view of increased price of fodder etc., and the need to increase pay in the interests of . restoration of morale. * * 7. 'It is impossible to estimate with any precision the amount we shall have to borrow in excess of tax revenue but I believe we shall need.at least. 1,000 million in addition to 500 million to be borrowed from National Bank. Lack of this 1,000 million, particularly during the next 5 months, will mean an actual stoppage in very .considerable amounts and to the extent that this stoppage affects salaries and wages it will mean further deterioration of the Government and its eventual collapse,' 8. Millspaugh then asks that the following requests should be submitted to the United States Government and to the other Allied Governments: (a) that Allied expenditure should be reduced, (b) that gold and .silver should be imported by the Allies to meet their requirements, (c) that importation of goods should be increased, (d) that Persian taxes should be paid (especially customs duties) where Allies are not clearly exempt, (e) that Allies should not pay wages in excess of prevailing wage scale, (f) that services of Government employees should not be solicited or accepted by the Allies, (g) that Allies should help to prevent exportation of essential comodities from Persia, _ ■ (h) that existing contracts imposing a burden on Persian finances should be revised (e.g. Russian munition contract), (j) that Persian Government should be allowed to postpone payments on obligations due to Allies (e.g. debt for lease/lend trucks). 9. But even if help on lines of paragraph 8 above is afforded this itself will not solve the problem, even if Persian Government does its full part,'Vfc need’an emergency loan from the Allies of•at least 1,000 million rials and I hope this loan will be given by United States Government'or jointly by United States and British Governments. It is true that loan will be inflationary but such effect appears to me to be the least of the possible dangers that are imminent'. . . ‘ •' . ' &gt; 10. Millspaugh suggests loan should be for a period extending to one year after the end of the war and should be dependent on maintenance of American financial Mission in Persia with Director General holding the powers now possessed by Millspaugh. The oil royalties might.be pledged as security for loan. [Summary ends].

In normal times a country whose price level is too high in relation to the rest of the world must either reduce wages and prices or in the long run be forced to depreciate its currency#.. On this basis the commission might take the ’’open' market rate of exchange prevailing before the war as representing equilibrium and decide that Persian currency ought to be devalued to an extent corresponding with that to which the rise in prices in Persia has been in excess of the rise in prices in the United Kingdom. But clearly an enquiry with terms of reference which would be bound to lead to this result would not be accepted by the Persians. The alternative method of deciding that Persian currency ought to be depreciated if the rise in prices in Persia has been greater than the rise in prices in Iraq, Palestine and Egypt would be difficult to apply and would spread about the idea that exchange rates against sterling in all these countries are liable to alteration. 2* The Persian argument would no doubt be that no account should be taken of any rise in prices which has been caused by Allied expenditure and that the proper rate is that which would exist if exchange control were abolished and v/e had to obtain the large quantities of Persian currency which we need from those in Persia who are willing to sell rials and to buy sterling with the object of hoarding sterling until p.fter the war, since it can only be used to a very limited extent for purchases in the meantime. Such a rate would be impossible to establish, but the principle would be entirely unacceptable to us and we could not for a moment consider it. V/e agree that it is vital to do any thing possible to slow down the rise in prices but we regard the maintenance of the present rate of exchange as no less important, 3. In short we feel that you could only stonewall though we recognise it is a sticky wicket. Was not appreciation of Persian currency during last war to a level which could not be maintained thereafter the cause of many of Persia 1 s post 1918 difficulties? If so, you may be able to make use of this. See also my telegram No. 26 Saving [of November 12th].* ^ ^admire Ble note prepared by Mr# Young mhich entirely M^tVia In with my own memories, hut perhaps I should \ *say that in my riew Dr# Millspeugh is the sort \ '•of man who never changes his mind. He has certain ’•idfeas fixes and I feel quite positive that these 'Hxvf! *have been entirely uninfluenced by anything that . ’•may have occurred in the world since 1927# Thus, ’ 'though extraordinarily narrow he is at the same 'time extraordinarily honest. I do not think 'that he will be likely in any way to work against 'British interests es such. On the other hand 'he will probably seek to champion the cause of 'the Persian Government guite regardless of whether 'the latter are really in a position to exert their 'power.' m (fiCopy. (E b9b7/bttcj/34). / Dr. IV'illspeugh took up hie post as Administrator- General of Finances in Persia just twenty years ago. The state of Persian-United States relations at the time bore some resemblance to that of the present day. After the disagreement with Greet Britain over the 1919 Agreement and the ensuing anti-British campaign* Persian eyes turned towards the United States as a possible financial saviour and as a political asset which might be set off against other foreign influences. Persians then, as now, clung desperately to the idea that across the Atlantic dwells the amiable milch-cow of their dreams and they expected the arrival of Dr.Millspaugh to be followed by a miraculous flow of United States capital into Persia which would leave that country financially independent of Great Britain. Dr. Millspaugh did nothing to encourage this beliefs on the contrary, he and his collaborators set to work manfully at the less spectacular, but more urgent, business of balancing the Persian budget. They made good progress in spite of strong Persian opposition. At the end of 1922 Persia’s financial situation was desperate, the Treasury was empty and salaries, both civil and military, were in arrears. The country was Just kept going by advances from the Imperial Bank of Persia. By the end of 1923 it vvas almost paying its way. Taxation was coming in: waste had been cut down and a serious effort was being made to centralise all departmental revenues in the treasury. These developments were the result of the United States Mission* s work and, in particular, of the strict financial discipline which Dr. Millspaugh enforced with ruthless impartiality. But it was not long before his efficiency and rigid control began to cause a certain restlessness among Persianofficials. This restlessness led to open antagonism and obstruction and in 1924 Dr. Millspaugh had a full-dress row with the Persian Government. After twlce threatening to resign, he got his way and emerged from the with his prestige, though not his popularity, eonsiderabtyenhanced. Tn the following year (1925) his contract was renewed for a further two years, with suitable expressions of esteem' on both sides. But the general feeling of disappointment and resent^fnt had not decreased. The state of feeling in 1926 is well described in the Legation's Annual Report of that year;- *The average Persian argues that the Mission ’’were engaged at great expense on the tacit ’’understanding that they would shortly produce a ”large American loan, in the wake of which factories ”and railways would spring up all over the country. 'Dr.Millspaugh has as yet produced n^ money from 'hall Street and the railways and factories are still rt non-existent. The average Persian concludes therefore 'that/fS ’•that the Amerlcens have been an unfortunate and expensive 'failure; that,in effect, they have done nothing more 'than urge Persia to live on her own resources, to enforce 'taxes without discrimination, and to dismiss everybody^ 'relations from Government employment on flimsy pretexts, 'such as incompetence or corruption. The vague disfavour 'with which the Mission is thus generally regarded is 'exploited by those whose interests have been directly 'affected by Dr. Millspeugfr*s rigid methods and is from 'time to time encouraged by the more serious criticism of 'those Persians who have a knowledge of economics... 'Dr. Millspaugh has, in effect, antagonised every 'section of the population. The politicians have been 'incensed by his constant and tactless interference and 'by the very extended interpretation ' hich he gives to the 'powers devolving under hie contract. The landowners - 'that is, the nobles and the clergy - have been driven into 'opposition by his ruthless insistence on their paying their 'arrears of taxation - an insistence which in July drove the 'aged Sepeh Salar to suicide. The Civil Service has been 'dismayed by the dismissal of so many Government servants 'and by the favours shown to the younger graduates of the ' American College. And finally the Shah and his Generals 'have been outraged by Dr. Millapaugh’s refusal to advance 'them money without the sanction of the Majlis and his 'constant, though fruitless, endeavours to examine their 'accounts'. Dr. Millspaugh tried belatedly to make up leeway by Introducing more popular proposals, but before the expiry of his contract the Persian Government made it clear that they would only renew it in a form which left Dr. Millspaugh with his wings severely clipped and reduced him to the status of an adviser whose advice could be accepted or rejected. Dr. Millspaugh refused and, after an acrimonious exchange of letters with Prince Piruz, the Minister of Pinance, he left Persia without a word of thanks from the Government he had served for five years. The Mission, which had numbered sixteen persons, dissolved soon afterwards, one at least of its members being accused of misappropriating public funds, and this phase of United States-Persian collaboration came to a rather undignified end. Of Dr. Millspaugh’e attitude towards Greet Britain and British interests in Persia, Sir Percy Loralne wrote in his despatch No.P61, of the Slst June, 1926s- 'The Americans, and especially Dr.Millspeugjh, 'evidently wished to be almost aggressively independent 'of foreign influence, or indeed of any suggestion of it; 'they would have found any British advice unpalatable and 'any British intimacy embarrassing. Peeling that in Dr. 'Mlllspeugh T had a fair-minded man to deal with, albeit 'a stubborn one, with little gift of Imagination, I 'decided that the best thing was to leave him as much as 'possible/*p 08 Eible to his own devices end to find his own feet# 'relying on the likelihood that in due course he would 'himself appreciate the loyalty and straight forwardness 'of British policy and realise that our influence in 'this country was a stabilising and not a disturbing 'factor the exercise of which was more likely to help 'than to hinder the task which he had undertaken* 'I am happily able to express the conscientious 'opinion that this result has been completely attained# 'I believe that Dr. Millspaugh has now revised his 'views in regard to British policy; that his mind 'is clear from suspicion in our regard; that, though 'he might on general grounds prefer to see a Persia less 'amenable to foreign# including British# influence# he 'is convinced that British influence is never wantonly, 'unjustly or improperly used; and even that he regards 'our silent sympathy and mor^l support as a definite 'asset to him in his task'* Sir Robert Clive, writing a year later in his despatch No.326. of the 29th June, 1927, confirms that Dr. Millspaugh’s tenure of his office has been marked by considerable progress# but is less confident about his change of heart 1- 'There is no doubt that Dr. Millspaugh and his 'subordinates have worked hard and honestly to the 'best of their ability, With the advantage of a 'very obstinate and determined character# the Doctor 'has undoubtedly prevented much waste and peculation; 'he has# in fact succeeded in getting into his own 'hands a control over Persian finances which the 'Persian Government never contemplated and which they 'now resent. • • In his desire, however# to make 'Persia independent of any outside control, or even 'of her established commitments, Dr. Millspaugh has 'in no case been helpful to British interests; although • 'greatly assisted by the Imperial Bank of Persia, he 'is unwilling to make the slightest recognition of their 'assistance. The bill# for which he was responsible, 'to create a National Bank of Persia was undoubtedly 'drafted with the intention of making this new bank 'the State Bank of the country at the expense of 'the Imperial Bank . • • Finally# I think it is no 'exaggeration to say that in no single matter of 'Importance has he ever helped His Majesty’s Legation 'to settle outstanding questions which concerned the 'Finance Department, while both Dr. Millspaugh and 'Colonel MacCormack have been frankly unhelpful and 'even antagonistic towards a fair and honourable 'settlement of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s affairs. I 'cannot honestly say, therefore, that from the point 'of view of British interests, this Legation would 'have much cause to regret the departure of Dr. 'Millspaugh and the American Financial Mission'. From/'7 1 ^ Brut dtv (rui&amp;xly Pc\h&amp; tl hJty /e£y (3L Prom the shove it seems that when Dr* Millspaugh resumes his post as Director-General of Persian finances, we cannO' 4 'jXpect from him any great measure of sympathy for Britisn aims or interests.'*' But at least he should have no illusions shout Persian failings. And if he is willing, as before, to insist that unpalatable measures are enforced when he is convinced they are necessary, we may not on balance be the losers. His new contract appears ' P’UJur'T to give him powers no less wide than those which he held tyJautt' Iktu*. It WU twenty yeerB ago. ^ ^7 One important point to which 3ir Robert Clive drew attention was that Dr. Millspaugh* s success, such as it was, could not have been achieved had not his mission coincided with a period when the Persian central Government was actively re-establishing its authority over the country as a whole. Dr. Millspaugh fretted at the extent to which the country’s revenue was used up by Reza Khan for the Persian Army. But without the authority which the Persian Government derived from ' this army, the enforcement of taxation, which was the most important single item of Dr. Millspaugh* s work, would never have been possible. At the present moment, the authority of the Persian Government over the country has greatly decreased and there is no sign of a re constitution of the Persian Army, without which it cannot be re-established. Tn this respect, Dr. Millspaugh may well find his task more difficult than on the previous occasion.Vith the Comi»nment» * »J ■ '»oc . - ' • i.atfe r* Forei /;t* A- £s7 t ?

In the coarse of negotiations for corrency settlement, question of a revision of i^resent sterling-rials rate of exchange was raised. Financial Counsellor replied that he was not even prepared to recommend to me that any proposal to lower present rate should be transmitted to London and tha« indeed with fall in internal purchasing power of rial due mainly to failure of Persian Government to introduce and enforce effective controls there was a strong case in equity for increasing rate. i-.D- tyk l IMPORTANT ^ ^ My telegram No. 1471, paraj 2 . liixch importance is attached by public, deputies, and press to this aspect of financial relations between the two countries and opinion is widely held, doubtless cultivated by enemy propaganda, that we arc getting more rials for our pound sterling than we ought to. It is argued, for example, that if rate were lower British authorities would be less prodigal in their expenditure and that prices can consequently be relieved of some of pressure of British purchasing power. 3. In view of difficulties with which Prime Minister found himself confronted. Financial Counsellor recommended to me that I should authorise the Prime Minister to say that while there were no grounds at the moment to raise rate of exchange issue it would be open to the Government to raise the question again with the Legation when the Government had succeeded in stabilising prices. It lias been made clear, however, that there is absolutely no commitment on the pant of His Majesty’s Government even to reconsider question which was regarded as settled by Financial Agreement of last May. 4. In my view question of rate of exchange is less important to us financially, than some degree of control in ■ price/2 . v price leve.l. If rise in prices continues at the present rate we shall he paying six months hence perhaps twice as much as we were paying six months ago for same volume of goods or commodities We must therefore, in our own interest, urge upon the Persian Government need to enforce every practicable measure of control. I am doing so. 5 0 Assuming this were done and present rise in prices kept within reasonable conformity with any general rise in -world prices, would you be prepared to consider re-opening rate of exchange issue on lines of paragraph 6 below ? 6 . Three, or six months from now a commission would be established consisting of a Persian, on American, and a British ^ re-presentative, who would, first examine period to which . effective price control measures had been enforced by Persian Government, If satisfied about this, Commission would then proceed to examine comparison [group omitted : ? between] purchasing power of rials in Persia and pound sterling in Iraq, Palestine, and Egypt and fix a rate, of exchange onat would be binding on all parties for i?ne duration of the war, P e ^ian Government accepting risk that such an examination might favour pound sterling and not the rial. ; 7 , It must be remembered that present rate was.fixed last Fay in a haggling negotiation and can be and is being attacked on that accost. If-we could do something such as I suggest in paragraph 6 we should flononstrate our uillingn to satisfy ourselves and Persians that Persia was getting_ a fair deal. I think an offer to explore the situation in this way would have an excellent political effect, counter hurtful propaganda and encourage the Persian Government to per severe with anti-infls.tiona.ry ueasm os.

M/i / s 6&lt;?6 / / A 4 . / As a result of passage of Currency Bill we have achieved our immediate object and we should now experience no difficulty in obtaining as many rials as we require. Although for the time being a political crisis has been averted, feelings of Majlis towards Prime Minister have become distinctly embittered and intrigues to secure his overthrow are growing every day. It is clear from the tone of the debate that Majlis are seeking to place on Prime Minister all the responsibility of the present evils and to set themselves up as friends and supporters of the Allies. This rather surprising change of attitude is, no doubt, inspired by United Front shown by Russians, Americans and ourselves here, and fear of dissolution. The effect of our victories in North africa has, of course, also played an important role. It is impossible to say how long this frame r of mind, on the part of Majlis, will last, but I am afraid that sooner or later Majlis will return to their usual tactics of obstruction and futile criticism with the result that no Persian Government will be able to carry on effective government of the country. Many questions, such as food distribution, price fixing, transport, press etc., are bound to cone up in an acute form and the present Prime Minister, who, it is understood, still intends to obtain special powers from the Majlis on certain issues, nay meet opposition in Majlis, which he is unable to overcome. In that case dissolution with the risks which it naturally involves, [*?is probably*] the best solution, if v/e are to avoid chaos of an interregnum during which business comes to a standstill, whilst frantic attempts are made to form a new Govern ment. To my mind Qawam’s administration is as good as we are [unlikely to find at present, an opinion which is shared by my llnited States colleague and my Soviet colleague and I consider that so long as it is prepared to co-operate, it should continue to have our full support. For above reasons circumstances may arise in which dissolution may be the only moans of assuring steady Government in this country, but clearly it would be preferable that Government should govern with a reasonable co-operation with Majlis.

My telegram No 0 1464o^ e ^ v ^ In return for new currency law I undertook on behalf of HiS Majesty's Government (a) .that we will ioin with United States Government in the proposed note^ declaration, and (b) that we will consent to an amendment of financial agreement increasing retrospectively the convertibility of sterling from 40J6 to 60?&amp;, 2 0 I have also agreed to recommend to you that conversion should take place at quarterly instead of at six monthly intervals but have reserved agreement on this point. 3* The currency law follows in principle the proposals put forward by me to the Persian Government. 4* You will observe that under Article 4 notes may be issued in future only against sterling or dollars convertible up to 60% into gold. This means that to obtain rials the Soviets will now have to sell sterling or dollars. Y/hile I regard this as the only fair arrangement at the same time I did not wish to be left open to the charge from my Soviet colleague that I had made things more difficult for him, and accordingly I drafted my proposals in such a way that the Soviets [grp. undec. ? would not have] been prevented from obtaining rials by means of a credit for a reasonable period ahead, long enough for us to have been able to induce them to enter into a financial agreement on lines similar to our own. The Persian Government however altered my draft proposals accepting full responsibility vis-&amp;-vis the Soviets. As for the United States Government it is desirable that they also should enter into a financial agreement which would place beyond doubt the convertibility of dollars to the extent at/2 , at least of 60$, guarantee paper dollars against depreciation in terms of gold, and give United States Government all the rials they need against sales of dollars. You will observe that the law makes no mention of rate of exchange at which sterling and dollars will be computed in calculating their value as cover for note issue,, The rates presumably will be fixed by decree under article 3 and will for the present be rates fixed by financial agreemento I have no doubt however that the law was deliberately drawn up in this way to leave it open to the Government to raise with us, at some future date, adjustment of rate. Feelers on this subject have already buen put out in the course of negotiations but I have said that in the present circumstances I am not even prepared to approach His Majesty’s Government with a proposal for a reduction, I shall however telegraph later on this subject* 6 n Note reserve control Committee referred to in the law Isa body established in existing statutory charter of the National Banks It consists of seven members, namely two deputies h c fed by the Majlis, a member from the Council of Ministers, the Attorney General, the Governor of National Bank; the Treasurer-General and Government Inspector of the National Banks The American Financial Adviser is now added,, It is a body as suitable for control of note-issue as any other purely Persian body that we were likely to get.-, 7 0 The original gold and silver reserves held by the 'Persian Government valued at current prices plus retrospective conversion of sterling and dollar balances up to 60$ will give the 60$ metallic cover, for the present note issue of 3*500 millions as provided in Article 5* My comments on political aspects of the situation will follow. . . 9r Please repeat to Washington if you think it n .'cessary and inform me if you do so.

'oVOyO Mv immediately preceding telegram. When United States Minister and myself saw Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs on November 10th they showed us proposed Soviet-Persian Financial Agreement. 2. I find that its form is designed to conceal its real purpose. Essential points are: a) all payments between the two countries whether for goods or other transactions to be effected through respective State Banks. . b; each State Bank to open an account with the other in rials without interest. c) account to be cleared at half-yearly intervals by payment of 40/o gold and 60/y United States dollars. d) gold to be' held by debtor bank until the end of the war and then delivered, to creditor bank. Gold may be moved to creditor bank meanwhile at creditor bank’s risk, but if moved may only be used for transactions w'ith sterling area, Canada or United States. Price of gold to be calculated at official United States price and on official rials/dollars rate of exchange. e) dollar payments under clearing to be paid to special account which may only be used for goods bought from United States and then only if creditor country has insufficient dollars from other sources. f) Soviets undertake to do all they can subject to exigencies of the war situation to deliver goods to Persia. s)g) agreement to expire one year after the war* 3* As Persia has little hope of getting any substantial quantity of goods from Russia under present conditions ana has roubles enough to meet her Embassy expenses for a long time* \and as Soviets evidently intend to secure large quantities of supplies from Persia the agreement amounts to nothing more than a device to secure rials on credit with a \ settlement of 40# at the end of six months and remaining | 60/o at some time, or point of time, when Persia can prove | her need of dollars* 4* Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me whether His Majesty's Government could not draw all rials required for Russians and Americans as well as for ourselves in virtue of our financial agreement. I said we were already the sole object of criticism on this point although a large part of the rials we received was spent for common war effort, e»g« road building repairs. I would not recommend that we should incur any more /grp. undec. ? therefore/* United States Minister disclaimed the desire to make our position more difficult. Minister for Foreign Affairs asked why the other /grp # undec. ?two7 Powers should not adhere to Anglo-Persian' financial agreement. I said I saw no objection in principle* United States Minister suggested separate agreements on similar lines and said he would...need very large sums in rials soon. Finally, Minister for Foreign Affairs, after giving unflattering views (which I did not encourage) on Soviet draft, said he would suggest to Russians that they should sign an agreement similar to ours* 5. I asked Soviet Ambassador November 11th whether I could now see his draft financial agreement. He produced one with a lame explanation of the delay. (I did not say I had seen it). I informed him quite frankly that in my opinion agreement, while superficially more favourable to Persian Government than ours, was in reality much less favourable. We were supplying some goods to Persia but nothing /grp* undec. ?like7 needs in rials so our agreement asked plainly for rials. Soviet was in much the same position as to goods and what the agreement did in reality (through /sic ?thoug^7 it did n °t say so) was to bind Persian Government to give the Soviet Government unlimited credits subject to a partial six monthly settlement I said the British Legation was quite tired of being the sole object of attack as to rials, the more so as much money was required in our common interest. With a mixture of amusement and confusion the Ambassador asked whether I wanted him to share the criticism and I gave him to understand clearly that was exactly what I did expect: if we took the same line we should have less trouble with the Persians. 6. During the conversation I learned that the Soviet Government still owe 65 (not as I had heard 30) out of 30 million rials credit which they forced Persian Government toEXT saifthev^d a ? ter the occupation.

No effective watermark is practicable on machine-made paper and watermark space would be empty and meaningless. Printers suggest over printing a lithographic pencilling of the watermark in this space which would give some additional protection. The 500 and 1,000 'rial notes could be plate-printed on mould-made watermarked paper within the time indicated in paragraph 1 owing to the small quantities required. 4.

C State Department have telegraphed United States Minister here asking him to comment on certain aspects of Persian currency situation that they find puzzling or disturbing, ^ State Department are repeating their views to His Majesty s Government. 2. United States Minister has asked me to give-him material for reply. Here is a summary of memorandum I have given to him today *of number of* points raised by State Department. Full text will follow by bag. 3 (a) Persian experience of steep increase in note issue not unique. Compare with case of Egypt and Iraq, i (t&gt;) Allied war expenditure major cause but increase could have been substantially stayed if territorial .Governments had taken appropriate anti-inflationar^ measures. (c) allied war expenditure in Persia now of order of 400 to 450 million rials a. month. Soviets according to their own estimate 80 to 100 million America about 20 million and British about 320 million. (d) This expenditure is direct addition to purchasing power i&gt;f Persian people and pressing on diminished supply of goods has jaused steep rise in prices. Prices of certain types^of I o°d- 3tuffs quoted showing rise from 1.00 to 300 per cent since before Allied occupation... Commensurate rise in prices of imported nanufaotured goods. (e) Rise in prices infcsdf necessitates larger circulation of currency for the same volume of transactions. (f) Notes probably inevitably temporarily hoarded by labourers and others working on sites remote from spending facilities.I 2 ., Cg) Probatly no hoarding of currency amongst wealthier^ classes whose whole tendency is to invest in land and house property and commodities. • &lt; h ). So long as United Nations need rials I see no prospect of avoiding further steep increases in note issue unless currency put out is somehow got back. (i) We should therefore concentrate on inducing Persian Government to adopt all practicable *anti-inflationary* measures without delay. t (j) In particular sale of gold on free market would bring us rials and simultaneously relieve pressure on commodities with favourable effect on price level. (k) Little prospect of Persian Government seriously coping with the present situation until *a Foreign .adviser* with adequate executive powers is posted in ivlinistey of Finance. (This is in the hope that it may do *something to expedite arrival of American Financial Mission) I trust that* nothing in the above appreciation is inconsistent with your views.[CYPHSR] qpy l I i' i i ft a 7 / ft a fr?* e.&amp; //&lt;\ Wfth tv ‘n / A M J K X c'&lt;^_ &lt;2/^'«.

J \ .¥ © / s' India Office Ogt QGOVr:\ 30th October # 1942 Dear V.Rley, In connection with the present Persian currency crisis, one expedient that has been put forward (oee e.g., para. 2 of Minister of State’s telegram to Foreign Office, No.1798 of 24th October, and para.3 of Tehran telegram to Minister of State, Ho.456 of 28th October) ie that the Persians should be allowed to convert into gold a still higher proportion of the sterling accruing to then). I hope that in considering any such proposal the possible effect on India will be borne in mind. Informed opinion in India is quite conscious of the connection between the Indian output of goods and servicer for the war and the aecumulation of sterling, which there is a growing tendency to regard as an undesirable currency to hold in such large quantities. There is already in evidence an apprehension that India nay q., C•8..C. eventually/eventually receive no real return, and a demand for gold rather than oterllng. Thle can only he ^CUP^w^ted if it should appear that tho British Government ie increasingly yielding to claime that a country ^ ll’ce Per? ia should hot be expected to hold sterling to a greater extent than it wishes, but can have gold instead. If the dissatisfaction in InPia on the subject should become very revere there is little doubt that it would adversely affect war production. I do not suggest that these cons1derations should necessarily be conclusive in considering the Persian queftiom but I do trust that they may bo given due weight.

Dear Baxter, Thanks for your letter of 30th October (F.6736/42). I am grateful to you for reminding me that in considering any proposal that the Persians should be allowed further privileges of converting gold into sterling the possible effect on India should be borne in mind. We clearly have to bear in mind the possible effect not only on India but also on other countries, including those in the Middle East. But we shall only offer further convertibility into gold if this seems necessary to avert forcible measures in order to obtain the Persian currency which we need, and I presume that, if we had to resort to forcibile measures, that also would have an effect both in India and in other countries.

I told Prime Minister that this is only one more sign of irresponsibility of deputies and that we must settle the question of Majlis or he would be unable to carry on. Prime Minister seems fully av/are of the grave situation and regrets he allowed his intention to dissolve Majlis when he came to power to be overridden.as he says it was, by the Shah and more timid members of his Cabinet. 2. American Minister, whom Prime Minister also informed of possible bill, warned Prime Minister that if it tried to pass any such measure Majlis would be inviting repetition of 'events” of August 1941. 3. Perhaps this risk will suffice to secure consent of Russians to dissolve Majlis since, if they sign a financial agreement, they will want to keep present rate of exchange of 32 to the dollar.

My telegram No. 1419 F of 25th October: currency and wheat crTSiSTT— On October 25rd Persian Minister spoke to me on familiar lines about his country's need for wheat and lorries and about the difficulties presented by our request for more rials. 2. I told the Minister that I could not believe that Persia really needed wheat so soon after the harvest. There must be any amount of wheat in the country and it was up to the Persian Government to make a really serious effort to secure this wheat. In any case, before we could decide whether it was necessary to ship any wheat to Persia, we should have to have more information about ( the stocks now available in the country. If Mr. Sheridan s enquiries showed that it would be necessary to import some wheat before the next harvest, we should have to consider what we could do to help. But the Minister must realise that in any case it w'uid be at least three months before any wheat could reach Persia from North America. 5 f Minister expressed the fear that the proposed further increase in the note issue would raise the cost of living and impose great difficulties on the Persian people. I reminded him that in the Financial Agreement nis Government had undertaken to make available sufficient rials to meet our needs. We had fulfilled our_obligations by providing gold to the value of £2 million: it was now up t;o the Persian Government to do their part by providing the rials we needed, I did not consider that they were entitled to link up the question of rials with the entirely separate matter of wheat supplies. As for lorries, I said that we fully sympathised with his Government's needs in this respect. Unfortunately we ourselves were also extremely short of lorries, but I would see what we could -do- to help. IND^ ^FICE4. Minister left with me an aide-memoire which asserts intei; alia that in accordance with Financial Agreement 6C^ of the foreign exchange possessed by the Persian Government musr be converted into goods. It has been explained to him that this is not the case, nide-memoire also states that the proposed Declaration would be futile, as regards alleviating the great anxiety felt by the Persian people, without a clause providing for the supply of 25,000 tons of wheat to be stored in Tehran.

As you say, the ^pviet Government, decision that their troops m Persia must live to a considerable extent on the country is disturbing. Indeed, it complete^ alters the situation, and you will have seen from ^ytele^^ Wo. 1419 to Tehran that I consider we must replace at least the ki0,uuu tons of'wheat and barley which the^ Russians are purchasing if we are to avoid the risk of famine m Persia. Whether we shall have to send further supplies o± wheat to Persia depends to some extent on the conclusions reached by Mr. Sheridan when his enquiries into the supply position have been completed. 9 for enlisting the co-operation oi the Soviet Government in view of the serious food situation in the Soviet Union, we could hardly expect them to 10115 as His Majesty s Government and the United States Nevertheless I agree that Russian co-operation in this matter would be of the greatest assistance, and I would not wish to rule out all possibility of this. But time is short, and I hope that it may not prove necessary to hold action whi e thp ^vi et Government reach a decision. In point ol xact i y may ^11 feel ™their interests arc best served by leaving it to us to solve this problem xor them. 5. We must also bear in mind the need to keep in step /with- 2 - with the Americans. . Their-responsibilities m Persia are already considerable and will be greatly increased as soon as they take over the administration of tne railway and the ports. The State Department have in the past been inclined to sympathise with Persian requests for.foodstutis, and the appointment of an American Food Adviser is bound to encourage this tendency by making them feel more responsible for the welfare of the Persian people. Indeed, tteumted States Embassy have already infomed us that, in their Government's view, it is necessary for the proper function ing of the supply route to Russia that the people ox Persia should be fed adequately. 4. Meanwhile, there are two points on which I should be grateful for your assistance. In his telegram No* 440 to you Sir R* Bullard reported that the withdrawal of our offer of 150 lorries, to be exchanged fpr arms, had caused great disappointment. The Persian Minister has- asked me for my assistance in securing 250 lorries^ as well as 25,000 tons of wheat. Wo cannot expect the Persians to solve their food distribution and I earnestly hope you will be able to let the Persians have some lorries at least sufficient for the distri of food stuffs. Both the Prune Minister and I feel that v we should not ptess for the rifles. 5. I am not sure whether payment has yet been made fnr the arms we took over from tne Persians last year. In view of my telegram No. 1544 to. Tehran,. I had assumed that oavment had been made. But if this is not so^ perhaps you would arrange for this to be done X am anxious not to give the Persians any cause to cl*im . that we are treating them unfairly..n*L K.

Imperial Bank of Persia has to-day been informed by Banque Mellie that on instructions from the Government it will accept deliveries of sterling up to November 2nd (repeat November 2nd) inclusive only and up to the equivalent of rials 150 (repeat 150) million only. It is only by the exercise of strictest economy and by postponing certain payments that we can make this sum sufficient, 2. Taking advantage of the presence^in Tehran of General Wilson, I have discussed the whole situation with him. We have explored together possible methods of achieving a satisfactory settlement by negotiation and are both in cordial agreement that force should be used only in the last resort. 3. Nevertheless in view of possible recalcitrancy of Persian Government we have discussed, owing to shortness 01 time, the precautionary military measures that ought to be taken now as a necessary preliminary to moving troops into Tehran after. November 2nd to take possession of stocks of note forms in Banque Mellie, should that necessity unfortunately arise. These pre cautionary measures will only involve unobtrusive presence in Tehran of a few staff and other officers. L, Even although opposition may be unlikely, if force is to be used, it would not be prudent to employ less than an infantry brigade, possibly with supporting artillery and a few aircraft. If Soviet troops' co-operate there is even less likelihood of any incidents. 5.

One sentence in this, if I correctly understand it, means that if Dc X.a Hue’s were to print notes in India on machine-made paper the latter wo Id have to be imported from the United ingdora.

In Parliamentary debate only two deputies spoke in favour of th» bill and then on the ground that the Government was doing its best to solve the food problem and must be supported. The main points from the opposition speeches, other than the bread shortage which all stressed, were: (a) financial agreement not yet passed by Parliament. (b) Pound exchange rate too high; rate should be freed and the pound allowed to find own level which would be much lower than the present rate. (c) Prices rose with every increase in note issue; the people were already suffering severely from high cost of living which previous increases in note issue for the Allies had caused and could not stand further increa.se. The Allies were bleeding the country and giving nothing in return. The war might go on for years and constant Allied demands for increases in the note issue would reduce the value of the kran to nothing. (d) The Allies were using Persia's means of communication for their own purposes to the exclusion of Persia's urgent needs. Further the Allies were stopping food supplies from reaching Tehran from Azerbaiyan etc. 2. In his reply the Prime Minister while saying that he did not defend the rate or the Treaty which were faits accomplis gave instances of works of lasting benefit to Persia which the Allies were carrying out. He was engaged in negotiations with the Allies over supply questions and hoped for a result in 10 to 15 days; during that period he wanted authority to devote part of 500,000,000 krans to their needs. 3.

S° mQ days ago the Government presented to Parliament a bill to increase, note issue by 2,000 (repeat 2,000) million rials. Bill met with a very hostile reception from the deputies press and public and the Prime Minister infoms me that he ', Su ' urQ its acceptance unless he is able to announce some deiinite promise of economic help from the British and/or United States Government. 2. Currency situation has now become acute, We can count upon supplies of rials sufficient only for a few days. Simultaneously a food crisis has arisen in Tehran caused dy interference by Russian military officers with supplies oi wheat from the Northern provinces. The position has therefore become most difficult for the Prime Minister and yesterday he was threatening resignation. The Soviet and united States representatives and I are sure that the threat is not idle. 3. Only after my -American colleague and myself had expressed our readiness to recommend to our respective S^ e u n3 T en ^ S 4 . c ? r ^ a ^ n measu:res in regard to food situation, about which I am telegraphing separately, did I succeed in opening up the possibility that a temporary currency bill may be rTIsae ?u* ro 8$? Parliament tomorrow. I have no guarantee that +Y e 5 5 h l s Wl11 ha PP en and J am greatly disturbed by the prospect that future supplies of rials may be conditional on the grant oi concessions which we.may be unable, and ought not to be following telegrams. 16 ^ 366 in thiS connexion 2 immediately 4. We^must therefore'consider what should be done in the event oi reiusal by the Government to increase note issue to meet our needs. 5. A possible .solution is: (a) that we should use our troops to take forcible possession of note-foims still in the Bank of Mellie Tehran,' and/ » •2. and (b) that we should establish ad hoc a Persian ‘currency board composed.of a British, an American, and possibly a Russian representative, and (q) .that the currency board should issue a new Persian Currency against purchases by the board of dollars and sterling at orlicial rate of exchange^ Notes would be present stock Persian note forms overprinted ’’guaranteed by Government of &amp;r |at Britain and the United States of America 1 ! I think -anglo-Persian notes would command as much confidence as any possible Persian issue. Fresh notes would have to be •printed for use when the present stock comes to,an end. - , ^ alternative we might first occupy the 2c then threaten the Persian Government with the measures of paragraph 5 unless they themselves y le gelation a Persian currency Board composed . aa 0 - Russian as well as Persian members and amended their currency law so as to provide unlimited note issue against cover of gold or foreign exchange. ^ Either alternative involves occupation of Bank of Dy surprise ? as otherwise the notes may be removed by the Persian authorities* J 8, I have no confidence that these crises will not recur unless something is done to place Persian currency under some degree of -allied control, and with every crisis the Persian Government will attempt to extort some fresh concession ir?m us, and for all my sympathies for Persia’s economic plight, I cannot recommend that we should continue to submit to this blackmail.

Bagdad (for General Officer Commaric^g-g.^Chief) mu , : fcT^Lak'dKl* BSaEDIRTE 1 . 1.9 f z I am concerned lest the currency situation in Persia should shortly again take a grave turn. It will be necessary for the Persian Government to present another- 1 bill to the ;, Majlis within the next few weeks asking for a furthier increase in note issue. Conversations that have taken place indicate , the increasing reluctance of Persia to continue to give us ? rials against sales of sterling., on the present growing scale. . Estimated sales during October £2,200,000 of which only about : £500,000 will be re-sold to the public for cost of imports //y ' J - etc * 2. The Government are pressing us to increase flow of suoolies. I have made it known that while we will honour our undertaking to maintain flow of essential supplies m.so far as war exigencies permit, Persia cannot.expect to escape enforced austerity and must resign herself to doing without luxury and semi-luxury goods so long as the present difficult supply and shipping situation lasts. I have also^indicated that the -• continuance of the flow even of essential supplies may well be deoendent on the Persian Government itself introducing and iSgrican^enforcing such anti-inflationary measures as are Apractic able in Persia. 3. This presentation of the facts of the situation has been ill-received and it is quite possible that a point may.be reached soon when the Persian Government in spite of financial agreement will decline to give us any more rials expept in return for some additional concessions, especially in the matter of supplies. 4. I have made it clear that we must have the rials needed to finance the Allied war effort in Persia. My United States colleague has been kept m plose touch with the situation and I Ihink I can rely on his support. For the first time the Soviet xUiibassador too has interested himsell in the currency situation in its Allied, as opposed to its purely Russian aspects# and I hope uo have his support too m any pressure that it may be necessary to exert to secure compliance with the financial agreement.

A public declaration by Russian and United Stages Governments in the sense of /aiied-.solidarity m this matter v/ould undoubtedly have a good effect not only m gelijf of currency situation itself but also by way of removing Great Britain from her present position of isoiated responsibility in the eyes of the Persian public. Furthermore, the acquisition of rials against sales of dollars on a substantial scale if this could be. arranged would connect the United States Government more directly with political consequences of present difficult economic situation. Hitherto Great Britain has carried the whole burden. Frequent attacks have been made on us in the hailis and elsewhere.' The Russians because they are feared and the Americans because the Persians do not wish to say to # annoy them, have escaped all public criticism.

' ’ Sir, Tehran, May 25, 1942. , I HAVE the honour to inform you that, as reported in my t^Lgram No fi34 r datecL 14th ATay_ 1942, the Imperial Persian Government on 14th May, 1942, authorised the Foreign Exchange Commission to resume dealings in foreign exchange at rates based upon the following rates for the pound sterling :— % Rials to £\ sterling. Buying rate ... ... ... ... ... ... 128 Selling rate ... ... ... ... ... ... 130 2. The change in the rate was effected by Decree No. 3622 of the Council of Ministers, of which I enclose a copy. % 3. Under Article 5 (2) of the Draft Financial Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Imperial Persian Government, the Persian Government undertakes to place no unreasonable restrictions upon transactions in sterling area currencies. Article 4 of the Decree of the Council of Ministers permits the Exchange Commission to issue licences without restriction for the purchase of foreign exchange by the general public. The commission is, in practice, issuing licences without restriction for the public to purchase sterling area currencies; but it is still necessary for the authorised banks to go through the formality of making application to the commission in each individual case. 4. I have represented to the Persian Minister of Finance that this procedure merely causes vexatious inconveniences and delay, and that the Exchange Commission should be instructed to issue a general licence to the authorised banks permitting them to deal freely in sterling area currencies at the controlled rates and without reference to the commission in particular cases. 5. Copies of this despatch (without enclosure) have been sent the Minister of State, Cairo; to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad, Cairo and Kuibyshev; to the General Officer Commanding, Xth Army; to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq; and to the Government of India.- I have,'&amp;c., R.

We argued that it was entirely unnecessary to include such a provision_in the agreement. They pressed the point however and finally His Majesty's Minister agreed to an exchange of letters of which the following is the text: Begins: It is understood in calculating sterling balance of Persian Government for supervisory financial agreement, all amounts sterling area currencies held by Persian Government or at the disposal of exchange commission will be convertible into pounds sterling at official rates of exchange.

(b) By R.A.F.: 9 Mohawk aircraft and spares. 2. R.A.F. may also wish to acquire 5.000 rifles and 2i million rounds of small arms ammunition and possibly certain other material. Certain further purchases are also contemplated by Middle East Command, but it is hoped to arrange these on a barter basis. 5, Our most pressing concern is to settle with Persian Government as soon as possible for arms we have already taken over. Our failure to do so. due mainly to Persian Government 1 s reluctance to accept sterling where they paid in other currencies, has had a very bad effect, particularly on Persian army whose co-operation we urgently require, I therefore hope you may be able to persuade United States authorities to instruct United States representative in Tehran to approach Persian Government without delay. Our military and air authorities will give all possible help with negotiations and will advise where necessary on technical matters.

For reasons of prestige they do not wish this phrase to go into a published document. Article 9. Leave out ’’cost of goods to be imported by Imperial Persian Government from North America” and substitute ’’cost of goods to be imported into Persia from North America”. They point out that private importers may require dollars to pay for imports which the Exchange Commission may not be able to supply. Article 10 (1).

My discussions hitherto have been on the basis (a) that gold would be provided by conversion of sterling to the extent that gold was needed to pay for North American supplies after the Persians had utilised all available dollar {repeat dollar) resources. I had not envisaged Persia first being required to use the gold she had already aequired under Article 10 and (b) that -sterling equivalent of any gold provided under^Article 9 would be deducted from increment or Persia's sterling balances for the purpose of calculating the amount of gold to be provided each half year under Article 10 (2). 4.

Dr. White of United States Treasury told our Treasury representative that they would not pronose to earmark definite sums in dollars for purchase of riyals. The intention was that the United States should keep our gold and dollar balance in funds and that in deciding what steps wpre necessary for this purpose, they would take into account such additional needs for gold and dollars as this Persian case. In fact our difficulty in obtaining riyals was one of the arguments used recently by Secretary of the Treasury in r^ccH-nrr that steps should be taken to increase our dollar' 2. Moreover I am not aware of any powers under which the United States could supply us with dollars. This is presumably out of the question. Any assistance to our financial' position must be through lend-lease framework. For this reason, and in view of the preceding paragraph, I am satisfied that it would serve no purpose to United’States to provide us v/ith sums in gold equivalent to those given to, Persia., Phillips agrees. 5.

Washington proposal that rials should be obtained in whole or in part against sales of dollars would be open to the same objection'from Persian Government as the supply of rials against sterling. They would, I think, only willingly accept dollars at their own rate of exchange and to the extent that they needed then to pay for goods and with the guarantee of convertibility of unspent balances to gold. 7. Financial adviser recommends that we should, if possible, avoid any concession on rate of exchange but --— ; suggests that we ought to be prepared to concede somewhat on conversion. i 18.

For us to accept Persian refusal to take sterling and ourselves.to provide other currency seems more objectionable on prestige grounds.

Your paragraph 4, Only satisfactory palliative in Persia, as elsewhere, seems to us to be that local Government should be brought to recognise^its responsibility for combating inflation and should accordingly mop up surplus purchasing power by taxation and borrowing, investing proceeds outside Persia against post-war needs when capital goods will be more easily obtainable.

V ; . ; : Murray this morning* Berle explained that, while the State Department did not in any way wish to. criticize - the British policy towards Persia, they felt that if amicable solution could be reached it would be far ■/ preferable to the use of threats. Theyi believed that if the present Persian Government fell, -it would pronably be followed by one much less favourable to our inferosuS. In any case, methods of pressure suggested seemed unlikely to be effective 0 United States would not _ be sending goods on lend—lease unless they thought this in the interests of the United States and Persian dollar balances were too small to provide for an effective means of pressure. He understood, however, that the Persians were still willing to sell local currency for dollars and this seemed to provide possible solution. 2. The State Department had been in touch with tho Treasury and understood that moves designed to increase United Kingdom dollar balances were going to be successfully worked out. Berle presumed that tor nrestige reasons, we should prefer to purchase nyals ourselves rather than for the United States to purchase them and hand them over to us. He thought that some scheme could probably be worked out to Provide that under general financial moves referred to above, United Kingdom would be provided with a sum of dollars over and above the amount which would pthorwise have been provided, which dollars wo could in turn use for the purchase of Persian currency. This would form part of land-lease arrangements and no dollar debt would be set up between the United Kingdom and the United States. 3. As regards surplus war material referred to in vour telegram No. 2281 , the United States would bo willing to purchase tni?Tfor dollars and to lend-leasc it to us, F-o-Rif • i 4. Berle went on to say that on Persifms were unwilling to take dollars but would still take gold, he thought that some scheme against gold i? probable] m this country. He assumed that sooner or later all of thele pSns would break down and that the Persians would demand goods, but we must cross that bridge when w reached it. Inflationary situation was developing in Persia while, at the same time, the Persian Government was short of money owing to the inability to collect revenue especially customs. In particular, military supplies were flowing in without paying duty. Thus internal crisis .... seemeda. seemed likely before..:y.eryjloia£. If we could make any remedial suggestions they would be welcome* 5. Berle was told that his suggestions -would be telegr&amp;phed immediately -to London and that the reply would be communicated to aim as soon as possible. 6. It will clearly be difficult to move the State Department to apply pressure along lines suggested in your telegram No. especially as they do not F-o themselves think such pressure would be effective. Whether plan suggested in paragraph 2 above would be satisfactory depends on the terms of the general financial-offer. I realise that your exchange difficulties are‘immediate. Would you wish us (a) to ask for^ • immediate supply of dollars herewith to buy riyals* or (b) to press the United States to make local ..purchases on Our behalf in Persia and 1end-1ease the goods to us and-to hire local labour for the tasks. &lt; I do not know what proportion of our expenses in Persia are in respect of local purchases and tasks or whether*if these were taken over by the Americans,you could find local currency for other purposes such as pay of troops etc. (INDIV)si; f ^ ^-\j\ r(Wfu^)^a • ^vAx4^J Jl T^r Rod e a ted saving to Bagdad for GoO.Cc and i'uO* C, Cairo for I/Iiddlo East. fl ('A ASU'^ 1 / a % to JopT-^m Nor- 1585 of* 1941 ahd your telo gram No^^o^ci^r-o-Qi^^r^ij ^V** Negotiations v/ith tho Persian Government for the purchase of further quantities of arms have reached a standstill because the Persians are unwilling to auuA.sell, and are pressing for settlement.for arms already taken over by us and the Russians# Regarding arms already acquired (a) what armsis His Majesty s Government to pay for and (b) v/hat is to be the price?

In view of continued ban on purchase of foreign exchange, it is desirable, if currency supplies are to be conserved during the present emergency, that available currency should be rationed and the needs of various spending authorities co-ordinated. 2. Suggest therefore that banking account should be opened with Imperial Bank of Persia in the name of His Majesty’s Minister out of which all other official accounts would be kept in funds. His Majesty’s Minister’s account would be the only account ; on which Imperial Bank of Persia would allow overdraft, 3. All army needs are now co-ordinated through Army Finance and Accounts Officer with whom Financial Adviser maintains close touch. Could arrangements be made similarly to co-ordinate all Royal Air Force needs in Persia through Royal Air Force Accounting Officer now in Tehran? 4. Arrangement would also have to apply to United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Latter are prepared to co-operate and if you approve or the principle, rhe United Kingdom Commercial Corporation should be instructed from London to fall in. 5, Polish Legation also require considerable quantities of rials against sales of sterling to finance the needs of Polish refugees.

Just before the Majlis met yesterday the Ministep of Finance sent for me to explain text of the Government's proposed Note Circulation Bill. He went on to say that a corollary to it would he what he called his '’financial plan”. 2. His proposal was that Exchange Control Commission would discontinue purchases of sterling from His Majesty's Government (including United Kingdom Commercial Corporation) that he would use 40G,COC ; 000 [gr*undec B ] Government credit to establish a revolving fund on which he would draw for our requirements of riais 0 Trie fund would be sustained by proceeds in rials of any supplies provided from sterling area tp order of the Persian Government, The prices in rials, at which value imported goods would be credited, could be fixed by us, thus getting over, for the present, any difficulty about a rate of exchange. 3. He further proposed the abolition of exchange control. He argued, as our requirements in rials would be met under the first part of his plan, (paragraph 2 above), it would cease to be a matter of consequence to His Majesty's Government what happened to the rate when it went free. 4. I informed the Minister of Finance that I could not recede from instructions of His Majesty's Government not to acquiesce in any arrangement that would fail to sQCure us all rials we needed against sales of sterling; that we should_ expect bill to be passed that day in accordance with the Prime Minister's assurance to His Majesty's Minister,-and finally that he should in no circumstances commit the Government to policy of abolishing exchange control®. 5. The bill was passed in the form reported in Tehran telegram No. 415 without; any promise by the Government, at all . lw events in publiclession, tnat exchange control would be abolished, although the rider added by the Majlis may well have been inspired by the Government in secret session. 6. Even if principle were acceptable, a floating credit of 400,000,000 would not'do more than suffice to keep us going for a couple of months* Combined requirements of the army, United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are about 200.000,000 a month. Imports by the Iranian Government from sierling(obtained)could not keep pace with RECo. POL. BEPt ~2APR1942 I jndia office2 . with the drain. Moreover lease-lend, if granted will diminish Persia’s need to 'buy essentials from us, 7. The effect of removing exchange control in present circumstances would 'be to lead ro an immediate and perhaps substantial fall in the rate. But once the initial shock had been absorbed rate would tend to rise, for bazaar will alv/ays want to import more goods than it can export. The Persian Government however is in a position to use its holdings^ of sterling in manner of an exchange equalisation fund. Moreover their holdings are sufficiently large (and are added to by oil royalties) to enable them to carry out an exchange war for a long timeo Effect of a free bazaar rate as proppsed could not fail to have repercussions on the proposed floating credit. 8. If Minister of Finance persists with his scheme I think we must threaten to blopk Persia’s sterling balances and require royalties to be raid into a blocked account, and I should like His Majesty’s Minister to be authorised to make this threat. Blocking would enable us to control the bazaar rate, but unfortunately would get us no more rials, /e snor'd therefore be driven back to considering the expedient of printing notes ourselves. 9. In my opinion the only course of actipn that on the one hand is consistent with Persia's treaty obligations and on the other hand will avoid this interminable bickering and clear the wav for us to get down to serious business is for Persia to agree to admittance of her to sterling area and to fix a fair rate of exchange that would then be permanent, jjter thao we could discuss outstanding questions of supplies and finan cial agreements in an atmosphere free at least from currency and exchange issues. 11, 1 am due to discuss the whole question with Minister of Finance within the next few days and should be grateful for a very early expression of your views. 12. Postscript, I have just learned that the Persian Government has &lt; instructed the banks to make no further purchases of foreign exchange. As to-morrow, Friday and Saturday are bank and g&lt;?yem inent holidays this introduces no vitally urgent issue but it_ indicates the general line along which the government is moving and of course adds support to the prevalent rumour that the pound is about to drop.

Bagdad market rate has been for some weeks below the official rate of 140 and at present stands at 130 to 135. It is true that this is probably due to rumours that official rate is about to drop against'sterling but I fear that dinars spending in Persia might not be able to maintain the rate of 140 or more and if it fell this would have unfortunate effect on the rate of exchange issue besides being diplomatic defeat. # I f therefore varied your instructions and said that His Majesty s Government were prepared to introduce Iraqi or any other suitable currency. Neither the Prime Minister nor Minister of Finance appeared to fear competition with dinars though they both realise the gravity of the situation.

On the question of immediate increase of note issue I have been able to get no satisfactory assurances. The Government still pleads its inability to add to the note issue without specific statutory authority. The Minister of Finance, however, has just informed me that Parliament will meet in private session this afternoon to discuss the currency situation and that an attempt will be made to get the necessary legislation passed tomorrow. Meanwhile I am holding out for i gry 1 ^ action on the line of paragraph 5 of my telegram No. 580. 5. As an immediate relief Prime Minister undertook that Bank Mellie would deliver 50 million krans to the Imperial Bank of Persia this morning. The Bank Mellie are however unable to do so as their own cash reserves are so low. They have offered 10 million which they have asked should be used for purchases of sterling from bazaar merchants who expect a fall in rate and want to get rid of their sterling. I have asked the Imperial Bank of Persia to accept this 10 million but unconditionally. A»t M** w 4. If I were certain that further adequate supplies of Persian (repeat Persian) currency could be made available within say 14 days the Imperial Bank of Persia might take the risk of further depleting its cash reserves in the meantime. But this risk cannot be taken merely on an assurance from the Persian Government which from past experience would almost certainly be valueless. It might be different if you could undertake to deliver currency nere by air from de la Rue plates used for present Bank Mellie currency as we have already suggested (see my telegram No. 511.) 5. Position is still unchanged namely^that if the army needs are to be met I must ask the Imperial Bank of Persia to discontinue from noon tomorrow payments of local currency to depositors other than His Majesty s Government unless in the meantime Parliament has authorised the required increasein currency or (which is unlikely) the Government agrees to dispense with this authorisation.

JJJJ 28th March, 194-2 29th March, 194-2 Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram. One of the problems which the Persian Government has to face is the shortage of currency - not of money, but of notes to enable transactions to be carried out. Currency supplies of Persia have long lagged far behind the countries' 1 needs. This has been obvious to every business man and contractor and the outsider can find proof by comparing Persia in this respect with the neighbouring countries whose economic and commercial circumstances are comparable with those of Persia. Note issue per head of the population in Iraq is twice as great as in Persia; in Turkey it is much greater still. 'Unfortunately economic problems in Persia have been allowed to take second place to internal politics, and the urgent question of currency was shelved for a month during the Cabinet crisis and now another fortnight has been lost owing to Parliamentary recess at the New Year. Currency, which was always inadequate is even scarcer now because of the important road railway and harbour works which the allies are carrying out and paying for in Persian money at full rates. Note the difference between British and German methods. In occupied territories Germans carry out military works by forced labour men often dragged far from home and miserably paid. Solution of the currency problem in Persia is simple since tne Government hold ample metal reserves, precious metal and foreign exchange, to cover any reasonable increase in note circulation and ample supply of note forms are held by the authorities in Tehran. One sign of the urgency is the fact that the Exchange Commission owes the Imperial Bank of Persia 170,000,000 crowns which the Exchange Commission wants to pay but cannot because there are not enough notes in circulation. It is understood that the Persian Government are taking urgent steps to remedy the present situation.[CrPHijR] DLiPARTiiiMTAL MO. 2 . FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE . S ir R. Bu llard .

Owing to the dilatoriness of the Persian Government in handling the situation, a currency crisis has now arisen. Cash reserves of the Imperial Bank of Persia have dwindled to little more than 100 million krans of which 50 million are earmarked against army Balances and only just-over 50 million are available to meet liabilities of about 350 million krans. Cash reserve situation of the Bank Mellie is even more concern ing. 2, 50 million krans will suffice for the army needs for only about one week. Imperial Bank of Persia have been obliged to tell the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation that no further cheques on the overdraft can be met. 3. I have had several interviews with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance during the past few days directed to securing action from the Persian authorities that will avert a crisis. Finally I have to-day been obliged to inform the Prime Minister verbally and in writing that I find it necessary to ask him to take the following steps: (a) Legislation to increase the note issue to be passed through all its stages not later than 31st March. (b) Amount of increased note issue to be not less than 5Q0 million krans. (c) Minimum sum of 200 million krans in local currency to be delivered to the Imperial Bank of Persia before noon 30th March. This amount includes 170 million krans owed to the Imperial Bank of Persia against purchases of sterling on the Persian Government account and of which settlement is long overdue. POL. DEPtM ' 4./ I 2^iVlARi942 INDIA OFFICE2 . 4. I have to-day infornied the Prime Minister that if [grp. omtd.] is not met in this way at these times it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government to take other steps one of which will involve the closing of.all branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Persia at noon 30th March - (this will be necessitated by the Imperial Bank of Persia having undertaken at my request to conserve its whole supplies of local currency for urgent needs of Hi's Majesty's Government). 5. The Prime Minister has to-day promised to do 'every thing in his power' to solve the difficulty. He has asked what help he can expect from His Majesty's Government to make a measure to increase the note issue more palatable to Parliament. He outlined two proposals to me namely (a) that we should allow conversion of part of Persia's’ sterling holding into silver and (b) that His Majesty's Government should give specific guarantees that supplies will be forthcoming from the Sterling Area on a more generous scale than at present. 1 6. As regards (a) I have replied that His Majesty's Government cannot supply silver to Persia for luxury purpose [2 grps. undec.] [grp. undec. ?without] political cover in Parliament; that in any case Persia has ample metal holdings to back adequately a note issue on the proposed scale; and that he has two reasonable alternatives at his disposal namely of re-valuing metallic stocks at current market prices or of following Egypt's example and making up any deficiency in metal cover with British Treasury Bills. as regards (b) I have replied that we cannot at the moment give any specific guarantees but that the whole question of supplies can be examined in connexion with the forthcoming discussions of the financial agreements under the Treaty. 7. The Prime Minister made the further objection that the Government could not put the additional notes into / circulation without specific statutory authority. To this I replied that in these times all Governments have necessarily taken Parliamentary risks and that the Government should order the release of additional currency as an emergency measure and later seek from Parliament whatever indemnity might be necessary. 8.

Acute situation has arisen owing to shortage of local currency. Banks unable to supply further rials against sterling. Military and United Kingdom Commercial Corporation will be unable to meet commitments to contractors,'etc. maturing in about ten days. Both banks have been obliged to instruct all branches to stop buying sterling. 2. Statutory limit of note circulation already reached. With His Majesty's Minister’s approval am making strong representation today to the new Minister of Finance that the statutory circulation must be increased forthwith by at least rials five hundred million beyond the present figure of rials two thousand millionsc 3. Gold coin of existing issue substantially* under valued. Re-valuation of gold stocks at current market prices gives more than adeauate cover for the increased issue proposed* Ample supply or note forms are held in Tehran. There is no reason why rhe situation cannot be immediately relieved. 4. If however the Persian Government proves dilatory or recalcitrant some steps are necessary. Suggest we ought to be ready to meet our current requirements by issuing rial notes ourselves through the Imperial Bank of Persia against sterling made available to the Persian Government at rials 140 to the £. 5.

CsyL^ \ i; 2 j 7 S • His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has reported that there has been increasing agitation anong certain classes of interested Persians for the devaluation of the pound in terms of Persian currency. 2. Persian Government have been told that we should view with strong disapproval any unjustifiable attempt to manipulate exchange rates unfavourably to us and His Majesty's Minister has been authorised if necessary to give the Persians to under stand that the question may affect our attitude ih the matter of economic assistanceo &gt; 3* His Majesty's Minister has been in touch with his United States colleague who agrees that clamour for alteration in the rate is dishonest and unfair, and says he has given his personal opinion against it in conversation with members of the Persian Government but without instructions from Washington he is unable to speak more strongly and he is unwilling to raise the subject lest State Department should disapprove. He has stated, however, that he would be glad to receive instruc tions. 4. United States Government will be seriously affected when they begin to incur expenditure on the assembly of air craft for the Russians at Abadan. If you see no objection, you should therefore point out to State Department that this is a matter in which the interests of our two Governments closely coincide, and urge them to authorise their Minister in Tehran to support Sir R. Bullard if he is in fact convinced that this Persian agitation is in fact unjustified and contrary to American interests. RECo. POL.
