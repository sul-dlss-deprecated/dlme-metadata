I am sending copies of this letter to Callender (Foreign Office), Lewis (G%P.O.), Zambra (I.C.A.C.), Wethered (P. &amp; T. Censorship), W/T Board, War Cabinet Offices and War Office. Yours sincerely, F.A.K. Harrison Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.©mm* Please see Political Resident's telegram No*1514 of the 26th June, flawed below. We have at long last extracted a reply from the Admiralty to our letter of the 11th July in which we asked them to inform us of the circumstances in which the Cable Station came to be opened at Khor Kuwai and reminded them of our agreements with the Sultan of L'uscat under which he is entitled to prior information of such facilities. Admiralty letter makes it clear that with true naval breeziness they have simply gone ahead with this scheme for a Cable Station without informing anybody. They express regret that this occurred owing to the extreme urgency of improving comnunications in this area for war purposes. The Cable Station and the buildings are required for wartime purposes only, and the Cable Station has been erected and is maintained by the Navy. Cable &amp; .Vire less are acting purely as Agents for the Navy. YIe must now pass this information on to the political Resident, and get him to consider what action is to be taken vis-h-vis the Sultan. It is clear that the original 1935 Agreement,under which the Sultan gave permission for the grant of certain naval facilities at Khor Kuv/ai, does not entitle the Navy to put up Wireless Transmitting or Cable Stations. These facilities must be regarded as special wartime facilities, which the Sultan agreed to provide for us as required, in return for a subsidy. He was, however, expressly told that whenever it became necessary^to ask for further facilities he would be ^ * informed as long as possible in advance of what was required. The Sultan may, therefore, be justifiably annoyed if he is now told of this Cable Station as a fait accompli . If it were not for the pending negotiations for the purchase of Nasirah Island which make it desirable that we should keep the sultan in a good humour with us, it wo H probably have been best to inform the Sultan of the Cable Station with apologies for not having done so before; but on looking into the papers to which the Admiralty refer in their letter (Ext, flagged on the^attached file), I find that in 1943 the senior Naval Officer did tell the Political Resident that the Navy had put up buildings at Khor Kuwai on a scale'considerably larger than that contemplated by the original undertaking with the sultan, and were also erecting a powerful ireless station. The Senior Naval Officei^Faised the question whether the Sultan need be informed, and the Political Resident tfcaan suggested that in view of our wartime agreement with the sultan, it was unnecessary to inform him of what had been done. I can only suppose that the Political Resident must then have overlooked cur undertaking to give the Sultan advance information. That being the case, however, I am inclined to doubt whether the addition of a Cable Station makes any great difference, and I should think that we might continue to leave things as they are, unless the Sultan himself asks any questions.

This assumption has been confimed as regards Khor ftiwai, by a recent report of a discussion that took place in Iiay 194-3 between the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the Political Resident in which the question of the erection at Khor Kuwai of additional buildings in general and of the V//1 station in particular was considered, and it was agreed not to approach the Sultan of Muscat in the matter. A copy of the notes on the discussion was foiwarded to the India Office under the Political Resident's No.37^-S dated 13th ^ay, 1943» 5* As regards the cable station mentioned in your letter under reply. My Lords decided that the communications facilities for the naval authority at Khor Kuwai would be much improved by the addition of a cable, and opportunity was taken, while the work Of laying the new Muscat-Bahrein cable was in hand, to loon it in to Khor Kuwai, and to build the cable station while the'*’work of erecting the Y//T station was being undertaken. 6 , The two schemes proceeded simultaneously at high priority. Arrangements were made with Messrs. Cable &amp; v/ireless Ltd. for the Muscat-Bahrein cable to be looped in at Khor Kuwai 6 . priority. and one rated by the Company purely for Naval purposes. My Lords understand that the Conpany have no commercial interests in the service, which is purely a war-time arrangement. The cable station has been erected and is maintained by the Navy. It comprises buildings to accommodate the Instrument Room (12 ft. x 24 ft.), Manager’s Office (12‘ft. x 15 ft.),^Workshop (12 ft. by 12 ft.). Stores (12 ft. x 15 f*t.). Batteries etc. (12 ft. x 12 ft. ) and accommodation fo?:* two British and three local staff. All the buildings adjoin the Y//T Station Receiving Building at Has Salib. In addition there is a small cable hut (8 ft. x 8 ft.) at the site where the cable lands. 7. All the buildings for the W/T and cable stations are required for war time purposes only. / 8 .-3- 8 . My Lords very much regret that particulars of both projects were not brought to the notice of the Secretary of State at an earlier stage and they trust he will appreciate that the emission was entirely due to the great urgency with which they had to be progressed, along with many other projects the Eastern Theatre.
