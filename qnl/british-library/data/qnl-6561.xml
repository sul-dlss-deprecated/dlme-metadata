Memorandum on Mr. Seward's Despatch of September 9, 1866, relative to the Protest of the Sultan of Zanzibar against Interference of British Cruizers with Slave Vessels in Zanzibar Waters. IN order to enable Lord Stanley to deal with this despatch^ it will be necessary to give a short account of our relations with the Sultan of Zanzibar in regard to Slave Trade matters. By the terms of an Agreement signed at Zanzibar in 1845, to come into force the 1st January, 1847, the Sultan engaged— 1. To prohibit, under the severest penalties, the exportation of slaves from his African dominions, and to issue orders to his officers to prevent and suppress such Trade; and— 2. In Article 3, to grant to the ships of Her Majesty's navy, as well as those of the East India Company, permission to seize and confiscate any vessels the property of His Highness or of his subjects carrying on Slave Trade, excepting only such as were engaged in the transport of slaves from one part to another of his own dominions in Africa, between the port of Lamoo to the north, and its dependencies, the northern limit of which is the north point of Kuyhoo Island, in 1° 57' south latitude, and the port of Keelwa to the south, and its dependencies, the southern limit of which is Songa Manara, or Pagoda Point, in 9° 2' south latitude, including the Islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Monfia. By the terms of an Agreement signed the 6th May, 1850, the Imaum of Muscat further consented that the ships of Her Majesty the Queen of England should be allowed to enter the creeks, rivers, and harbours in his territories in which slaves were shipped contrary to his orders, and that the vessels found engaged in the Slave Trade might be seized and the barracoons destroyed. For some time after the conclusion of these Agreements, the attention of the Commanders of British cruizers was directed chiefly to preventing the export of slaves by European slave-vessels intended for the supply of the Brazilian and Cuban markets, and comparatively few native vessels were captured engaged in supplying the slave markets in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. As, however, the demand for the Brazilian and Cuban markets decreased, it was - found that the Slave Traffic in native vessels considerably increased. In 1861, Colonel Rigby, the British Consul at Zanzibar, and Brigadier Coglan, the British Resident at Aden, called the attention of Her Majesty's Government to the great extent to which the export in slaves was being carried on from- the East Coast of Africa, the numbers exported being variously estimated by different authorities at from 30,000 to 40,000 annually. The greater portion of the slaves thus exported from the mainland were derived from the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and those not derived from this source, from the Portuguese territories. They were carried chiefly to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, probably two-thirds going to supply the slave markets in those localities, whilst from 6,000 to 8,000 remained in the Island of Zanzibar, and the balance found their way to Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and indirectly to the French Possessions in the Indian Ocean under the name of free labourers. The Commanders of British cruizers found great difficulty in dealing with the native [341] Bvessels engaged in this Traffic, in consequence of some of thera claiming to belong to the Sultan of Zanzibar, and others to be engaged in removing slaves from one part of His Highness' territories to another (that is to say, from the mainland to the adjacent islands), and as none of these vessels carried papers, it was found impossible to distinguish between those vessels that were really engaged legally in carrying slaves coastwise from one part of the Sultan's dominions to another, and others actually employed in taking slaves to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Under these circumstances, Colonel Rigby was, in 1861, instructed to express to the Sultan the regret of Her Majesty's Government that the stipulations of the 1 reaty between Great Britain and Zanzibar, by which His Highness was bound to prevent the exportation of slaves from his dominions, had not been more faithfully observed, and he was directed to point out that, so long as the Coast Traffic in Slaves was permitted, it would be impossible for His Highness, or for the Commanders of British cruizers, to prevent slaves from being exported from the Zanzibar territory. It was therefore suggested to His Highness that he should give orders prohibiting, under severe penalties, the transport of slaves coastwise from one portion of his dominions to the other; and it was also proposed to him that he should conclude an Additional Article to the Treaty between Zanzibar and Great Britain, authorizing British cruizers to seize and detain all Vessels under the Zanzibar flag engaged in the coasting trade on board which slaves might be discovered. The Sultan for some time demurred to these demands; but upon their being renewed with greater earnestness in 1862, and its becoming apparent, even to His Highness, that the Coasting Slave Trade along the shores of his dominions was carried on mainly for the supply of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, he, in 1863, consented to prohibit entirely the transport of slaves from port to port in his dominions during the months of January, February, March, and April, those being the months that the northern Arabs from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea frequented the coasts of the Sultan's territories for the purpose of procuring slaves. His Highness also, in 1864, instituted, at the suggestion of the British Naval Officers, a system of passes to be issued to all vessels legally engaged in trade under the Zanzibar flag, and he further consented to allow British cruizers to seize and detain all Zanzibar vess'els not furnished with these papers, as well as all Arab vessels engaged in the Slave Trade, even within His Highness' territorial waters. It is under the foregoing circumstances that British cruizers have for the last few years been engaged in the suppression of the Slave Trade on the East Coast of Africa. The Traffic has 'been unquestionably considerably diminished, but our cruizers have found oreat difficulties in the execution of their duties, chiefly owing to the system of passes not being found to work well, slavers having been found with passes given to other vessels, and also on account of the inability of the Sultan and his authorities to cope with the northern Arabs who come down in such numbers when the monsoon suits, as to intimidate the authorities unless a British ship-of-war is at hand to support them. In fact, in the town of Zanzibar itself, the Arabs have hitherto been in the habit of making raids and carrying off the negroes into slavery, and considerable numbers are undoubtedly carried off annually in this manner by the northern Arabs. We are now asked by the Sultan to forego the exercise of the right of search and detention in Zanzibar waters, and His Highness claims the sovereignty over the whole area of water inclosed within lines drawn parallel to the African coast from the outside of Pemba and Zanzibar Islands to Cape Delgado and Lamoo. This practically amounts to a claim on the part of the Sultan to jurisdiction over the waters for a distance of ten miles from the coast, and as all the native vessels engaged in the Slave Traffic keep close in shore, the claim if acquiesced in would render any further attempt on our part to prevent the exportation of slaves from the Sultan's dominions perfectly useless, and would undoubtedly lead to a very considerably increased traffic. I would very deferentially venture to submit that we should refuse to acknowledge the Sultan's pretensions, and hold His Highness to the strict letter of his engagements for the suppression of the Slave Irade. Any concessions on our part would be mistaken by the Arab slave-dealers, and would be looked upon as a tacit permission on our part to continue the Traffic. But it will be seen that Mr. Seward, in his despatch dated 10th September, recom mends the abandonment altogether by our squadron of operations for the suppression of the Slave Trade on the coasts of the Sultan's territories, on the ground that it should be our policv to strengthen His Highness' position as a Ruler on the African coast^ whereas our operations for the suppression of the Slave Traffic have tended to weaken his power and to discredit him in the eyes of his subjects. A further reason alleged why we shouldabandon our present policy is, that while, on the one hand, our cruizers are engaged in capturing native vessels carrying slaves, on the other hand, British capital and enterprise are both engaged in the Island of Zanzibar in encouraging the Slave Trade by employing slave-labour; and this discrepancy in our proceedings is stated to be the subject of comment to our discredit among the natives and authorities in the Sultan's territories. To deal with this latter point first, I would say that only a few years since we compelled our Indian subjects, of whom there are a great number settled at Zanzibar, to manumit^ some thousands of slaves who Colonel Rigby found were held by them in bondage in that island. And as regards British capital and enterprise being employed in encouraging slave-labour, I take it Mr. Seward alludes to the firm of Fraser and Co., who have recently taken some large sugar estates on lease from the Sultan, and have contracted for a supply of slave-labour, and our answer to this is that as soon as Her Majesty's Government were aware that British subjects were thus indirectly encouraging the Slave Trade and violating the provisions of British laws, no time was lost in warning the firm in question of the penalties the}' - were incurring by their proceedings. This despatch only went off a few weeks since, and could not, therefore, have been received by Mr. Seward when he wrote his despatch of the 10th September. There is not, therefore, a shadow of a pretext for accusing Her Majesty's Govern ment of inconsistency in regard to their proceedings for the suppression of the Slave Trade. With regard to the statement that it should be our policy to strengthen the Sultan in the eyes of his people, I would observe that this may be true, but it can hardly be held that, in order to strengthen the position of the Sultan, we are to connive at his subjects carrying on the Slave Trade to an unlimited extent in violation of His Highness' engage ments towards this country for the suppression of the Slave Trade. The Sultan has, in fact, been maintained on his Throne mainly by British influence, and we should unquestionably be open to the charge of inconsistency if we continued our support, and at the same time tacitly acquiesced in his subjects engaging in the Slave Trade to an unlimited extent. In proof of the extent to which slaves are now introduced into Zanzibar from the mainland, I would quote Mr. Seward's own Report dated in May of this year, in which he states that 72,000, or an annual average of 14,400 slaves have passed through the Zanzibar Custom-house during the last five years as imports. Now, it is notorious that the island cannot utilize the services of all these negroes, and therefore there can be no doubt that the majority of the slaves imported are again exported to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. As every slave introduced into Zanzibar pays a certain duty to the Sultan, and Mr. Seward's statistics are taken from the Custom-house Returns, there is little doubt that the numbers are not exaggerated. The Sultan has been warned on many occasions that he must not reckon on the Slave Trade as a source of revenue, and that the sooner he made arrangements for abolishing the Traffic in Slaves between the mainland and Zanzibar, the better it would be in the end for him ; for that the time would come when we should feel obliged to put a stop entirely to the export of slaves from the African Coast. It would seem, however, that although the export of slaves from the Portuguese Possessions on the East Coast has very considerably decreased, the numbers exported from the Sultan's territory, must have considerably augmented, and Mr. Seward's suggestions, if carried out, would increase the Traffic still more. There remains now to deal with the suggestion contained in Mr. Seward's despatch of the 20th of September : viz., that we should obtain possession of the Island of Abel- Kury, near the Straits of Socotra, and establish a depot there, where captured slave-vessels might be deposited and our cruizers coaled, instead of having to proceed, as they are obliged to do now, some 1,200 to 1,500 miles away from their cruizing-ground whenever fuel is required or a capture of slaves is made. I can only say that I entirely concur in this suggestion, and have no doubt that if it is intended to put a stop to the Slave Traffic on the East Coast, we shall sooner or later be compelled to adopt some such measure as is now recommended, and that it will be good economy in the long run to do so. I think, also, it would be a very good plan, and in fact they have recommended it to the Admiralty, that during the months of January, February, March, and April, when the monsoon suits for the Arabs to run their cargoes to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, our cruizers should be concentrated in the Straits of Socotra, as all the native vessels are compelled to pass those Straits to make for the northern ports; and therefore if an efficient watch is kept there, it would be impossible, or very nearly so, for a single slaver to escape, but during the remainder of the year 1 think our cruizers should be employed on the African Coast; as if that coast were abandoned altogether, the traffic from the Portuguese4 territories would doubtless be considerably augmented, and the Slave Markets in Madagas car, the Comoro Isles, and elsewhere, receive a great stimulus. Foreign Office, December 8, 1868. p.S It will be right to explain that since the Agreements of 1845 and 1850 were concluded with the Imaum of Muscat. His territories were, on his death, which took place in 1859, divided between his two sons, the African Dominions going to the present Sultan of Zanzibar, and the Arabian to the Sultan of Muscat. No. 2. Mr. Egerton to Mr. Merivale. gj r Foreign Office, January 8, 1868. I AM directed by Lord Stanley to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Stafford Northcote, the accompanying copy of a despatch from Mr. Churchill, Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, inclosing copies of a correspondence which has passed between the Viceroy of India, the Sultan of Zanzibar, the Government of Bombay, and Mr. Churchill, having reference to the subsidy which the Sultan of Zanzibar is bound by his Treaty engagements to pay to the Sultan of Muscat. In submitting these papers for Sir Stafford Northcote s consideration, I am to state that Lord Stanley would be glad to be informed whether, apart from the consideration that the Treatv which stipulates for the payment of this subsidy was negotiated under the auspices of the Indian Government, there are any Indian interests involved in the political relations between Zanzibar and Muscat which render it advisable for the British Government to require the Sultan of Zanzibar to continue the payment of this subsidy to Muscat. i . T i Should Indian interests not require the enforcement of this payment, I am to observe that there are considerations connected with Imperial interests which would seem to Lord Stanley to warrant our leaving the Sultan free to act as he may think fit in this matter. ^ Sir Stafford Northcote is aware that a very extensive Traffic in Slaves is carried on from the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and that considerable pressure has been brought to bear upon His Highness with the view to induce him to put a stop to this Traffic. By the Treaties existing between Great Britain and Zanzibar, the Sultan is bound to use his utmost efforts to prevent the exportation of slaves from his dominions ; but these Treaties do not prohibit the removal of slaves coastwise, from one part of the feultan s dominions to another, nor the importation of slaves from the mainland into the Island ot Zanzibar. 1 ^ ^ It is found, however, practically impossible to prevent the exportation ot slaves trom Zanzibar territories to foreign parts, so long as the Traffic coastwise, and the importation of slaves from the mainland into Zanzibar, is permitted to exist, ior the masters of vessels engaged in this coast Traffic when met with by British cruizers carrying slaves, allege that thev are taking them to Zanzibar, when in reality they may be bound to the Persian Gulf, or the Arabian Coast, and even when passes are issued to vessels legally employed in carrying slaves, these passes are often subsequently found in the possession of vessels engaged in the foreign Slave Trade. , . . . . rp . Sultan Maiid, there is every reason to believe, is anxious to act up to his ireaty engagements for the prevention of the export of slaves from his dominions to foreign parts, and indeed, with a view to put a stop to this Traffic, he has. withm the last few years granted important concessions to British cruisers, beyond what his Treaty engagements require him to concede. But. on the other hand, His Highness requires slaves to cultivate his own estates, and to supply the labour market in Zanzibar ; and as a considerable duty is levied on the importation of every slave into Zanzibar, he is thus pecuniarily interested in the introduction of as large a number as possible into that island. In fact. His Highness derives an important part of his revenue from this source, and his means would be materially crippled if it were put a stop to. The consequence of this state of things is, that irom i 3 000 to 14,000 slaves are imported into Zanzibar annually, a number far exceeding the requirements of the island, the excess being carried off by the northern Arabs to su PP l y the slave-markets in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Coast, and the Red Sea, these Arab slave-dealers finding it easier to escape the vigilance of the British cruizers when they shiptheir slaves from Zanzibar, than when they embark them from the coasts of the main land. It is evident, therefore, that if effective measures are to be taken for the suppression of the Slave Trade on the East Coast of Africa, it will be necessary to put a stop to the carriage of slaves coastwise from one part of the Sultan's dominions to another, and also to limit the number of slaves into Zanzibar, with the view, if possible, eventually to put a stop to the importation entirely. But it cannot be expected that Sultan Majid will make the requisite concessions in this matter, unless some means are found to compensate him for the diminished income which must necessarily be the consequence of his losing the capitation tax on slaves introduced into Zanzibar. This loss would, however, in a great measure, be made up to him if he were not compelled to pay the subsidy of 40,000 dollars annually to the Sultan of Muscat; and considering the conduct and character of that Chief, Lord Stanley is of opinion that Her Majesty's Government would be perfectly justified in declining to use their influence to compel Sultan Majid to continue the payment of this subsidy, and more especially as the Sultan of Muscat has not kept his Treaty engagements with us for the suppression of the Slave Trade, his own vessels having been captured by British cruizers engaged in the Iramc in Slaves.

WliH reference to your letter of the 6th June, I am directed by Lord Stanlev to transmit to you, for the information of Sir Stafford Northcote, copv of a desnatch from Her Majesty s Consul at Zanzibar, suggesting that the Order of the Star of India should be conferred upon the Sultan of Zanzibar as a mark of the Queen's approbation of His * • c o n duct towards distressed British seamen, and of other praiseworthy acts for which it had already been decided to make him a suitable present; and I am to request that you will move Sir Stafford Northcote to favour Lord Stanley with his opinion upon this suggestion of Consul Churchill.

Indio February 20, 1868. ^ VIIH reference to your letter of the 8th ultimo, I am directed by Sir Stafford ' Northcote to state, for the information of Lord Stanley, that the whole question of British relations with the Chiefs of Zanzibar and the Persian Gulf has, during the last month been under his deliberate consideration in Council, and that, adverting to your letter now under reply he has addressed a despatch to the Government of India (a copy of which is inclosed) calling for the opinion of the chief Indian authority with respect to certain matters connected with the present question, regarding which more accurate information must exist in India than in this country. « T.^ik lth reSV ^ t0 *; he s P ecific question contained in your letter of the 8th ultimo, whether apart from the consideration that the Treaty, which stipulates for the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy (to Muscat) was negotiated under the auspices of the Indian Government, there are any Indian interests involved in the political relations between Zanzibar and Muscat, which render it advisable for the British Government to require the Sultan of Zanzibar to continue to pay the ' subsidy,' Sir Stafford Northcote observes that on this point he will doubtless receive a full exposition of the views of his Excellency the Wroy. In the meanwhile, I am directed to forward the accompanying papers recentlv received from the Government of Bombay, in which it will be seen that the non -payment of Cthe subsidy has been alleged by the Sultan of Muscat to be a cause of inability on his part to control his rebellious subjects, and to prevent political cornplications very embarrassing to the officers of the Indian Government, who represent British interests in the neighbour hood of the Persian Gulf. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) HERMAN MER1VALE. Inclosure in No. 4. Sir S. Northcote to the Governor-General of India in Council. gi r India Office, London, February 15, 1868. LI FORWARD, for the information of your Excellency's Government, and for any observations which you may have to offer upon the subject of it, a copy of a letter dated 8th January, 1868, addressed to this Department of Her Majesty's Government, by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. You will observe that Lord Stanley desires to be informed whether, apart from the consideration that the Treaty, which stipulates for the payment of a subsidy by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Sultan of Muscat, was negotiated under the auspices of the Indian Government, 'there are any Indian interests involved in the political relations between Zanzibar and Muscat, which render it advisable for the British Government to require the Sultan of Zanzibar to continue the payment of the subsidy to Muscat.' 4 2. I avail myself of this opportunity to inform you that Her Majesty's Government have had for some time under their consideration the question of the control of British relations with the Chiefs of Oman and the Sultan of Zanzibar. Much correspondence has at different periods taken place between the foreign Office and the India Office on the subject. The discussion has recently been renewed, and it appears to me now to be more than ever desirable that the matter should be placed permanently on such a footing as may conduce most advantageously to the public interests, whilst removing Departmental uncertainties and inconsistencies, which may in practice lead to considerable embarrass ments. In furtherance of this object, I am anxious to obtain from you an expression of your Excellencv's opinion. 3. You are aware that the Agent at Zanzibar, who is an officer of the Bombay Government, is also Her Majesty's Consul at that place, and in that capacity he corresponds with, and receives instructions from, the Secretary of State for Foreign if Affairs. 4. The Agent at Muscat, who is an officer of the Bombay Government, also holds a y Consular commission from Her Majesty. His correspondence is conducted wholly with y \ the Bombay Government, from whom he receives his instructions. He has no direct communication with the Foreign Office. 5. The salaries of both these officers are, as your Excellency is aware, paid entirely from the Indian revenues. 6. 1 need not inform your Excellency that the Agent and Consul at Zanzibar receives instructions from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, mainly because an important part of the business which comes before him is connected with the suppression of the Slave Trade on the East Coast of Africa. It is obvious that the regulation of the measures to be taken for the prevention of this Traffic must rest undividedly with Her Majesty's Government, as represented by the Foreign Department. Questions also have arisen in connection with the action of other European Powers in that part of the world, which must be submitted for the decision of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 7. But although there are substantial grounds for this partial control by the Foreign Office of an officer holding a situation under the Indian Government, it is not the less apparent that this state of things is attended with considerable inconvenience. It engenders inconsistency of action and conflicts of authority. It has happened on some occasions that the Agent at Zanzibar has received contradictory instructions from the Bombay Government and from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which have placed him in an embarrassing position. The Commanders of Her Majesty's vessels in these waters are also subject to the receipt of inconsistent orders from the authorities in India and in England. 8. I am anxious, therefore, to be informed whether, in your Excellency's opinion, there are any political and commercial questions arising out of the relation between India and Zanzibar of sufficient importance to render it necessary that any controlling authority Ishould be exercised by the Indian Government. I am well aware of the large body of British Indian subjects continually trading with or settled in the Zanzibar country. But I do not see that this suggests anything more than a reason why a contribution from the Indian Treasury should be made towards the cost of the Consular Establishment. 9. I am not forgetful of the intimate relations between the Chiefs of Zanzibar and Muscat, or of the references made from time to time to the British Government upon points connected with mutual obligations contracted by them under our arbitraments, references of which the papers now forwarded to us furnish a suitable illustration. It is essential that, in dealing with these questions, the officers of the British Government should display no want of harmony among themselves, but it is to be apprehended that, if the Zanzibar and Muscat Agencies were under different controlling authorities, it might be difficult to maintain that entire unity of sentiment and consistency of action which should be apparent in all our dealings with the Chiefs of Oman. I wish, therefore, to be favoured with your Excellency's opinion as to whether the disadvantages likely to arise from separation are such as to outweigh any benefits that may arise from placing the Zanzibar Agency entirely under the control of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 10. Your Excellency will observe that, in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, the question is beset with difficulties, and these difficulties are likely to be increased, if the greatest care be not taken in the choice of Agents employed in that part of the country. It appears that there has recently been some irregularity in the appointment of officers to whom the management of our affairs at Zanzibar has been committed; the gentleman now entrusted, with the charge of the Consulate and Agency, not being an officer of the Indian Government, but a member of Her Majesty's Consular Service, and, as far as I can gather from the correspondence before me, not selected by the Governor of Bombay. I need not add that, since the duties formerly entrusted to the Indian navy have been performed by the officers of Her Majesty's cruizers in that part of the world, and the effort to obtain duly qualified interpreters from among their own body has failed, it has become more than ever necessary that our Agent at Zanzibar should be selected with reference to his special qualifications for the performance of these particular duties.

Lord Stanley will observe that the Government of India have sanctioned the payment by the Sultan of Zanzibar of the yearly subsidy of 40,000 crowns to the Muscat Chief, through the medium of the Bombay Government; and I am to add that Sir Stafford Northcote purposes to communicate to the Government of India his approval of this arrangement.

I AM directed to transmit copy of a letter from the political agent at Zanzibar, Nos. 334-64, of the 16th September last, inclosing a reply from the Sultan of Zanzibar to the khureeta from his Excellency the Governor-General of India, forwarded with your letter dated the 22nd May last, No. 493. A translation of the letter is inclosed. 2. With reference to the intimation conveyed by the Sultan regarding the payment of the arrears of subsidy due to Muscat, 1 am to state that, should the money be offered to this Government by the agent of His Highness, it will be received; but no demand for payment will be made pending the receipt of instructions from the Government of India. Inclosure 3 in No. 6. Mr. Churchill to the Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. (No. 334.) September 16, 1867. 1. 1 RECEIVED by the mail that reached this on the 2nd instant your despatch No. 1939 of the 6th June, relative to the subsidy to be paid by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Treasury of Muscat. 2. The subject, as you are aware, is a peculiarly tender point with Seyd Majid, and in His Highness' present state of health, I thought it well to prepare him for the reception of his Excellency the Governor-General's decision. 3. It was, therefore, only the third day after the arrival of the mails that I placed the 'Viceroy's letter into Seyd Majid's hands. I remained several days without knowing, or making any efforts to ascertain, the effect that his Excellency's firm injunctions had produced on the mind of His Highness, refraining from making any inquiry lest he should be led to suppose that I entertained a sort of doubt as to his complying with his Excellency's recommendations. 4. After three days' meditation Sultan Majid sent me his Secretary to read to me the Viceroy's letter in Arabic. Shaikh Suliman, having drawn my attention to the words 'kharaj' and 'bee tassaduk' contained therein, observed that the Sultan was as much affected and pained by the terms in which his Excellency the Viceroy's letter was couched as by its purport, for he was not only requested to pay the subsidy, of which he had hoped the English Government would have spared him the shame, but this subsidy was now for the first time, called 'tribute,' and his representations to the Government of India were said to be 'false,' or 'not to be believed.' 5. I replied to Shaikh Suliman that I had carefully read the Viceroy's letter sent to me in English, and that I had reason to believe His Highness' impression of the tenor of Sir John Lawrence's letter was incorrect, but that the erroneous impression was solely to be attributed to the translation in Arabic, for, in the English copy, I found the wordsubsidy used as heretofore, and the expression ' untenable ' had inadvertently no doubt been translated into ' false.' I added that, if His Highness would write to me on the subject, I should be happy to relieve his mind on these points, and show him that his Excellency the Viceroy had no wish whatever to hurt His Highness' feelings, but that he did not conceal from His Highness that he thought Seyd Majid's objections to pay the subsidy futile and untenable, and had told him so in plain language; that he himself must perceive how groundless were His Highness' arguments, and must regret as much as I did that they had ever been put forward. Shaikh Suliman confessed that they were futile, and told me, confidentially, that he had failed, at the time, in urging the Sultan not to use them. The important question was next asked as to what the Sultan should do ; to which I unhesitatingly replied that His Highness had no alternative; that he had agreed to refer the dispute between his late brother and himself to the arbitrament of the Governor- General of India ; that an award had been made, which he had accepted, and which he was bound to fulfil; that, on the death, or the murder, whichever it may be, of the Sultan of Muscat, His Highness had conceived the idea that his engagements were at an end; but that he was now clearly told by the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India that he was mistaken, and that he must continue to pay the subsidy to the Treasury of Muscat, and that, under such circumstances, he had no option but to obey. 6. The Sultan's Wuzeer said, in reply, that he would report my opinion to Seyd Majid, but that he thought it very hard on the Sultan to be obliged to assist the murderer of his brother by paying him a subsidy. 'I will nevertheless,' he added, 'use my influence to bring Seyd Majid to reply favourably to his Excellency the Governor-General's letter, however much humiliation it may cost him to do so.' 7. The next day I received a further visit from the Sultan's Secretary, and was informed that, after much deliberation, His Highness had expressed his willingness to pay the subsidy, but not to Salim. He w T ould do so indirectly through the medium of his Excellency the Governor of Bombay, but that even this he did with the hope that his Excellency the Governor-General would reconsider his decision and spare him the shame that was being imposed upon him. 8 Taking into consideration the pending negotiations reported to you in my despatch No. 310-59 connected with the subsidy in question and the Slave Trade, and the fact, moreover, that in compelling Seyd Majid to pay this subsidy into the hands of Seyd Salim, we should undoubtedly be making an enemy (though not, perhaps, an open one) of the man who is most inclined to be our friend, and who can do more towards the suppression of the trade we most abhor on this coast than any independent Prince. 9. I have concurred in Seyd Majid's propositions, and His Highness' Agent, Ludda Damjee, of the house Jeiram Sewjee, has received instructions to pay the amount of arrears due to the Treasury of Muscat to his Excellency the Governor of Bombay. 10. I may here be allowed to record a hope, and I do so sincerely, and I trust, advisedly, that something may yet be done to encourage Seyd Majid in his efforts to co-operate with us in the suppression of the Slave Trade, and to confide on the British Government as his best friend and ally. P.S.—I have the honour to transmit herewith inclosed letters addressed by Seyd Majid to his Excellency the Governor-General of India and his Excellency the Governor of Bombay, with their translations, and also the copy of a correspondence that has passed Detween Sultan Majid and myself on this subject.

We have now to inform your Excellency that we will obey the order of the English Government and pay the subsidy, but we decline to pay it to the man who killed his own father. We will not give him a single dollar, still less the sum of 40,000 dollars. To do so would bring shame on us before the Arab nation and before the world, and would be a [341] D10 sin in the sight of Government, for, by our law, such an one shall not inherit his father. But if the English Government insist on our paying the subsidy, we will do so to them, but not to Salim, our brother's murderer. Let the British Government then, if it so please, brinff on us shame by paying this money to Salim.

In that letter your Excellency writes to say that it is incumbent upon me to pay 40,000 kursh, as decided by Lord Canning. 1 beg now to observe that, had Lord Canning been able to know that Saulem would kill his father Thoweynee, and succeed to the guddee of Muscat in the place of his father, his Lordship would have never recorded SUCh ^acknowledge that I am under the orders of the British Government, but 1 shall not pay even one kursh, not to speak of 40,000 kursh, to one who has slam his father; for if I pay him this sum, I shall perpetrate a deed which will be held ignominious in the eyes of the people of Arabia, and other places. I am also not justified by the laws ot God to pay this money to him (Saulem), for, according to the Mahometan law, he, as he has killed his father, cannot succeed him. But if the British Government considers it incumbent upon me to pay 40,000 kursh, I shall pay this sum to that Government, not to Saulem, who has slain my brother. If the British Government wishes to expose me to shame, it is in its power to pay the said sum to Saulem.

(Signed) CLINTON.13 Inclosure in No. 11. The Governor'- General of India in Council to Sir S. Northcote. Sir, Simla, May 14, 1868. WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Political despatch, dated 15th February, 1868, submitting: for our consideration a copy of a letter addressed to you by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which questions of much importance are raised regarding the future relations between Zanzibar and Muscat, and the position of the Political Agent and British Consul at Zanzibar. 2. In our despatch of 14th January, Her Majesty's Government have already been informed of our decision that the payment of the annual subsidy of 40,000 dollars to Muscat is an obligation which the Chief of Zanzibar is bound to discharge; and we are of opinion that no evasion of this obligation could be countenanced by the British Government without prejudice to our good faith, and the risk of serious political complica tions in the Persian Gulf. 3. The award given by Lord Canning in 1861, was expressly declared not to be a temporary arrangement, but to be binding on the successors of the then ruling Chiefs of Zanzibar and Muscat, and ' to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the Ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality between the two inheritances derived from ' His late Highness Syud Saeed, which two inheritances were thenceforth to be distinct and separate. The negotiations which resulted in this award were undertaken at a time when Syud Thoweynee, of Muscat, had actually started on an expedition against Zanzibar, in which there was every prospect of his being successful, but which he was induced to abandon solely on the promise of the British Government to effect a just settlement of his claims. If it is to be left to the option of the Sultan of Zanzibar to evade fulfilment of an award so unequivocal in its terms, and concluded under such circumstances, it appears to us that the moral influence of our Political Officers in the Persian Gulf will be weakened, the Chiefs of the Om^n Coast will prefer seeking the adjustment of their quarrels by the sword to relying on the mediation of the British Government, and there will be danger of a relapse to the state of anarchy in the Persian Gulf, which it has cost many years of negotiation and not a little bloodshed to put down 4. The annual subsidy, morever, was intended as compensation to Muscat for the loss of valuable claims in Zanzibar, from which its revenues could be recruited. The State of Muscat is poor, and if the Zanzibar subsidy be withheld, it will be difficult, and probably impossible, for the Sultan to maintain a settled government, or preserve his position against Wahabee influence, which even now it is difficult to resist. The efforts of the British Government to preserve the peace of the Persian Gulf and suppress piratical aggressions, which are liable to occur at all times, and more especially where Wahabee influence is felt, are intimately bound up with the establishment of a firm government at Muscat, and we strongly deprecate the adoption of any measures tending to weaken the authority of the Sultan. 5. With respect to the character and conduct of the Sultan of Muscat, it has never been satisfactorily proved that he murdered his father, Syud Thoweynee, and however grave may be the suspicion that he did so, that suspicion can furnish no ground on w^hich we can countenance the withholding of any of the rights appertaining to him as Chief of Muscat, after we have formally recognized him as Ruler of that principality. If we once admit the propriety of the refusal of the Sultan of Zanzibar to pay the subsidy, on the ground of the misconduct of the Chief of Muscat, to be consistent, it would be incumbent on us to retrace our steps and deny the right of Syed Salim to the Throne of Muscat. In point of fact, however, we did not allow, as we ought not to allow, the personal merits or demerits of Syud Salim to weigh in our consideration of the question of his recognition. Our duty is to support that Ruler whom the subordinate Chiefs and people have chosen for their head, and, so long as he can maintain his position, we are bound on broad grounds of policy to give Syud Salim at any rate our moral support. 6. Having regard to the position of Zanzibar and its general relations to India, and to the tribes on the shores of the Indian Sea, it appears to us that the Political Agent there ought to be under the Government of Bombay, subject to the control of the Government of India, rather than under the Foreign Office; and that the Agent should be chosen by the Government of Bombay, who have the best opportunities for making a good selection. Indeed it would, in our opinion, be better that the present anomalous state of things, and the inconveniences alluded to in paragraph 7 of your despatch, should continue, than that the control of political affairs at Zanzibar should be entirely transferred [341] Eto the Foreign Office, which could not take cognizance of cases affecting the interests of Indian subjects, and subjects of neighbouring allied States, with the rapidity and convenience that are desirable. 7. At the same time we are of opinion that the inconveniences arising from double references, and the risk of conflicting orders, would be best obviated by causing the Agent at Zanzibar to discontinue his direct correspondence with the Foreign Office. No real loss of time would ensue from the transmission of communications affecting European subjects through the Bombay Government; and there can, in our opinion, be no more reason for direct communication with the Foreign Office from Zanzibar than from Muscat, where the Agent enjoys no such privilege. On the other hand, if Muscat be under the Government of India, and Zanzibar be under the Foreign Office, there will not only be a conflict of directions, but, sooner or later, also a probable conflict of policy.

I AM directed by Lord Stanley to transmit to you to be laid before Secretary Sir Stafford Northcote, in the event of his not having already received a communication on the subject from the Government of India, the accompanying copies of a despatch and its inclosures from Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, reporting that Sultan Seyd Majid has determined to burn, for the future, all Northern Arab dhows arriving in the ports of his dominions, and stating that His Highness has come to this determination with the view to put a stop to the export of slaves from his territories, it being notorious that the Northern Arabs repair to the East Coast of Africa with no other motive than that of procuring slaves. Lord Stanley desires me to observe that, however notorious it may be that the object of the Northern Arabs in visiting the African Coast is to procure slaves, such a proceeding on the part of Seyd Majid as the indiscriminate destruction of all Northern dhows visiting his coasts would doubtless be open to grave objections, and might possibly compromise His Highness with European States in the not improbable event of the Arab shipmasters procuring the shipment on board their vessels of property belonging to a European merchant as a colourable pretext for their voyage. But whilst deprecating the high-handed course of proceeding which the Sultan of Zanzibar proposes to adopt. Lord Stanley is nevertheless of opinion that the British Govern ment is bound to render every possible assistance to His Highness in his endeavours to put a stop to the export of slaves from his dominions, and his Lordship with this view would suggest for Sir Stafford Northcote's consideration whether it would not be right and expedient that instructions should be addressed to the British agents at Muscat and in the Persian Gulf, directing them to warn the native Chiefs on the coast of Arabia, and in the Red Sea, and in the Persian Gulf, that they will be held responsible to Her Majesty's tjovernment for the due and strict fulfilment of the engagements which they have contracted with the British authorities for the prevention of the African Slave Trade, informing them at the same time that the Sultan of Zanzibar has determined to put a stop to the export of slaves from his dominions, and that British cruizers having received orders to support His Highness in carrying out this determination, all Arab vessels found engaged in, or equipped in any way fox the Slave Trade, will be seized and destroyed.

[341J F18 ' The first is, that he was not specially and personally appointed Judge. No one was. The Order in Council simply provided that Her Majesty's Consul should exercise Vice- Admiralty powers, and the explanatory clause stated that the word Consul should include any person exercising the functions of Consul (I quote from memory, as 1 have no copy here). Therefore, Dr. Seward was as competent to dispose of such cases as 1 or any one else could be. Aeain, he doubts whether captures made under the Treaty, can be adjudicated in Zanzibar. It appears to me beyond question that the Treaty which authorizes us to seize slavers also contemplates their adjudication, and that Her Majesty has as much right to establish a Vice-Admiralty Court at Zanzibar as one for the administration ot ordinary civil and criminal justice. n ^ i ^ j- If a vessel, even owned by a subject of the Sultan, be captured for slave-trading on the high seas, in virtue of the Treaty, it may surely be adjudicated in any competent Court, and the establishment of one at Zanzibar, instead of being regarded as a grievance, should be hailed as a proof of our desire to give the accused a fair hearing; formerly a prize was destroyed first, and adjudicated afterwards, in the absence of those concerned, now it would be brought to Zanzibar for adjudication, and all concerned would have a tair Dr. Seward makes the remarkable statement, that if such cases are to be submitted to the new Vice-Admiralty Court, it will be a virtual extension to a British official on shore of that arbitrary power which naval officers may wield at sea. As well may he say, that because a criminal in England should not be tried and condemned by the police, therefore he ought not to be tried and condemned by a magistrate. . . . , , • . t . The Royal Navy ought not to have anvthing approaching to judicial functions; the Consul ought. The Naval Officer being the captors, and pecuniarily interested in the capture ought to have no voice in its condemnation; while the Consul is presumed to be an officer of experience and integrity, with no interest in the capture, and therefore a proper person to exercise judicial functions.

The principal object of Sayed Mohammed bin Salim's Mission would appear to be to procure from Her Majesty's Government the release of the Sultan of Zanzibar from the obligation which His Highness contracted under the mediation of the Indian Government, to pay to the Sultan of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 dollars, regarding which obligation Lord Stanley's views have already been communicated to Sir Stafford Northcote in the letters addressed to the India Office on January 8, May 27, and June 4.1 am to state that, as a correspondence relating to this subsidy has recently passed between the Sultan of Zanzibar and the Government of India, and as, moreover, the revrolution that has within the last few Weeks been accomplished at Muscat cannot fail to have an important bearing upon the relations between Muscat and Zanzibar, and between those countries and the Government of India, Lord Stanley is of opinion that any negotia tions which may take place between the Sultan of Zanzibar's Envoy and Her Majesty's Government would, with more advantage to the public service, be carried on at the India Office than in this Department; and if, as his Lordship does not doubt, Sir Stafford Northcote concurs in this opinion.

The early departure of your Highness' Envoy from this country will prevent the Undersigned from discussing with him the questions which he was charged to bring before the British Government; but the Undersigned assures your Highness that full considera tion will be given to those questions, with the nature of which Her Majesty's Government are well acquainted : and that Her Majesty's Government have every desire to view with favour the wishes of your Highness, so far as a compliance with them may be made consistent with any engagements which they may have heretofore contracted.

I GLADLY avail myself of your suggestion that I should put on paper some of the points that I had the pleasure of discussing with you on the 12th January in reference to the existing Slave Trade from the African Coast to the ports of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. I abstain from saying anything in reference to the inherent cruelty of the Trade at every stage. The writings of Baker, Livingstone .(Zambesi and Tributaries, ch. 18, 19, 29) and Waller, and the despatches of General Rigby, Consul Seward, and Brigadier Coghlan, have left no room for doubt on that point; but it has not been made so clear how great an injurv to trade is produced by it. In those districts of the interior which have not been touched by it, there is generally found an industrious population working iron and pottery, cultivating different kinds of grain, and showing anxiety to obtain a knowledge of European art and agriculture. (Livingstone letter, 2nd February, 1867.) Among these tribes cotton cloth is the article * To India Office, June 4; India Office, June 25 ; July 2; to India Office, November 20, 1868.most in request. It is the very coin of the country. There cannot be a doubt that were there facilities for regular trade, there might be an almost boundless demand for such goods; but the Slave Trade makes it impossible. If we can rely upon the statements both of officials at Zanzibar and travellers in the interior, the supply of the Zanzibar markets requires a sacrifice of from 100,000 to 200,000 lives a year, and vast districts of the interior are kept in a state of insecurity that renders industry hopeless.* Again, the natural channel for trade with the interior is the Zambesi, but this is rendered useless. General Rigby says of that river:— ' At the Portuguese Settlements the Slave Trade is carried on in the most shameless manner, all the Portuguese authorities aiding and abetting it, and dividing their nefarious gains, 'f They well know that legitimate trade would injure it, and do all in their power, and with complete success, to hinder the former. Their treatment of ships from Natal has already occupied the attention of the Foreign Office. Now if we look to the Island and Harbour of Zanzibar we find a rapidly increasing trade, which amounted in 1859 to 1,664,000/4 The town contains large and prosperous European firms, and also many thousands of British subjects from India, through whose hands passes nearly all the trade of the port, and who are rapidly acquiring all the wealth and property of the island. (Rigby, pages 4 and 5.) The following passages show how much their interests are compromised by the piratical Arabs, whose only object is to carry on the Slave Trade:— ' During their presence Zanzibar resembles a city with a hostile army encamped in its neighbourhood. Every person who is able to do so sends his children and young slaves into the interior of the island for security. People are afraid to stir out of their houses after dark, and reports are daily made of children and slaves kidnapped; and in the suburbs of the town they enter the houses and take the children away by force,'§ Captain Bedingfied writes :— ' By British protection alone is the Sultan kept on his Throne.' ' As soon as the Northern Arabs arrive, the people confine themselves to their houses.' ''They have complete command of the place, and were it not for the fear of the men-of-war, the lives of the British subjects would never be safe.'|| In this state of things it is necessary to keep a naval force to maintain order and to protect British interests. This is a duty that must devolve upon our fleet; and I venture to point out that it would effect a distinct saving of naval expenditure to put an end to the Slave Trade at once, rather than to suffer it to continue, and, at the same time, to maintain a force to guard against one of its collateral evils. But we cannot check it while the existing Treaties remain in force. By them our ships are prevented from seizing slavers along 420 miles of coast.Sultan Syud Majid offers** to give up'the Treaties, and I cannot but hope that Her Majesty's Government may be able to accept his offer. The only objection arises from the condition that he makes, viz., that we will cease to compel him to pay the subsidy of 40,000 dollars a-year to Sultan Syud Selim of Muscat. It is not pretended that we have any interest in this payment, but it is supposed by some that the Indian Government have guaranteed it. 1 cannot believe that the Governor-General ever incurred so great a risk, and there is strong ground for believing that he purposely avoided doing so. In 1860, Brigadier Coghlan was sent out to investigate the merits of the dispute existing between the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. After careful examination, and according to his instructions, he proposed terms of arbitration in four clauses, the third and fourth involving the payment of the subsidy.ft He then proceeds to say tha^, possibly, Sultan Majid may hereafter object to pay the subsidy, and in order to meet this contingency he proposed two more clauses. On turning to the Resolution of the Honourable Board, dated 4th February, 1861, page 131, paragraph 16, I observe that the terms proposed by the first four clauses were adopted, but that the subsidiary clauses 5 and 6 were rejected without any reason * Lieutenant-General Rigby's Report on Zanzibar, and Slave Trade Papers, 1867, Class A, Inclosure 5 in No. 76. t Report on Slave Trade, by Brigadier Coghlan, paragraphs 5 and 8.

In the absence of any other explanation, it may reasonably be assumed that the Governor-General avoided involving the Government in any such guarantee, and preferred making no allusion to the possibility of non-payment. Believing that the good faith of the Indian Government is in no way involved, I sincerely hope that this offer of a change in the existing Treaties may be accepted. To do so would facilitate the operations of Her Majesty's ships ; it would help to maintain order in the harbour of Zanzibar, by checking the invasion of the Arab pirates; and it would tend to suppress the largest branch of the Slave Trade that exists. The kindness and courtesy recently shown to the Zanzibar Envoys by Lord Clarendon and the Duke of Argyll, lead me to hope that the circumstances of the East African Slave Trade will receive their attention, and that they may before long take measures for its more effectual suppression.

I HAVE the honour to communicate, for the information of his Excellency the Governor in Council, that the long debated question of the Zanzibar currency has at last been brought to an end. The difficulties experienced in the settlement of this affair arose entirely from the conflicting interests of the various nationalities here represented. The Americans were naturally unwilling to lose the advantage they had gained, while French merchants, now the chief importers of coin, labouring under a serious disadvantage, were anxious for an immediate change. As far as English interests were concerned, I believe we occupied a neutral position; what we lost by the undervaluation of a sovereign was far more than balanced by the premium on the rupee. On the 1st of November, the agreement entered into by the Sultan and the American Council, and tacitly concurred in by the other Consulates, had expired, and as the Sultan showed little disposition to move in the matter as he had promised, I addressed a letter to His Highness requesting to be informed which coin had been decided on as the future dollar of the Zanzibar State, whether it would be the German crown as before, or the American dollar, now artificially its equivalent. I pointed out at the same time, through his Secretary, that on learning the unit of account selected by His Highness, I should be in a position to inform him as to the relative intrinsic value of the English and Indian coin., His Highness intimated at once, through his Secretary, that the silver German dollar of Maria Theresa, known here as the ' shami' dollar, had always been, and would continue to be, the money of Zanzibar; but he said that he found himself in a difficult position, as the Americans urged strongly for two years' delay previous to any change, and were prepared to assert that by equalizing their coin to the German dollar he had taken the American gold as the money of account in terms of which they had kept their accounts. Such an act as this would amount to virtual repudiation of their debts, which are chiefly due to British Indians, to the amount of 2 per cent., for which there could be no remedy short of a lengthened lawsuit in America. I therefore consented to a compromise, allowing one year to elapse before the commencement of the new rule, by which the black continues to be the standard of account throughout the Kingdom of Zanzibar; while all other money, of whatever nation, is left to take its market value, as is at present the case with the copper currency. To this agreement the American and the German Consuls have placed their names and I find the measure gives great satisfaction to the British Indian population, who by the sudden depreciation of the American coin would have been serious losers. But little confusion is likely to be experienced by the fluctuation of coin. At the present day no one would think of making large payments in depreciated coin which command almost their true value in the market. In order to give confidence, and to save trouble in the adjudication of claims in Her Majesty's Consular Court after that date at their intrinsic value as determined bv the Bombay Mint. What the ultimate result of this measure of the Sultan may be it is difficult to predict. The Americans have ceased to import coin, finding cotton goods more profitable. While the French, even now under existing circumstances, have become the chief importers of coin. I must state that, in my opinion, His Highness has dons wisely in retainino- the old German crown as his unit of account. I have the honour to forward copies of His Highness' Proclamation and the notifica- L 341 J X30 tion published at the British Consulate thereon. The purport of which I venture to notice should be made known to the mercantile community of Bombay. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN KIRK. No. 36. Dr. Kirk to Lord Stanley.—(Received January 23, 1869.) (No. 44.) My Lord, Zanzibar, November 24, 1868. I HAVE the honour to inform you that I was waited on yesterday by Abdullah-bin- Omar, cousin to Sultan Abdullah of Johanna, the bearer of a letter from His Highness, in which I was told that Moosa, the leader of those Johanna men who deserted Dr. Living stone near Lake Nyassa, and who returned to Zanzibar bearing the false tale of his murder, had been imprisoned in irons at Johanna for eight months, and was now sent to Zanzibar and placed in my hands for further punishment or liberation. In reply, I informed King Abdullah's Agent that His Highness had, by the punish ment inflicted on Moosa, anticipated the wish of Her Majesty's Government, and that now it would be my duty to set him free, but as one banished from his native land. 1 assured the King's Envoy that Her Majesty's Government would receive with much satisfaction the assurance of friendship shown by this act, in having made an example of one who had caused so much grief and anxiety through his cowardly flight and base lies. Accordingly, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that the prisoner Moosa has been set at liberty, but cautioned not to return to Johanna without the King's permission. I have, &amp;c.

SOME few days since I wrote you, by the brig ' Africa,' to the effect that when my dhow went to Zanzibar I would send you the leader of the gang that deserted Dr. Livingstone; he is now on board of her, and will be delivered to you for punishment in whatever form you may see fit. I have ascertained that this man was the cause of all the trouble, beyond a doubt; therefore I send him alone to you. I have bad him in irons for about eight months, as that was the only means of punishing him I had here. Sending him away will haVe the desired effect, I think, as people will have a horror of being sent away from their native home This man and, in fact, the whole party, are not fair specimens of Johanna men at all; they are nothing but bushmen, endowed with very little judgment and common sense. This man will be delivered to you by my brother Abdullah-bin-Omar. Any communication you may have for me please deliver to him. (Signed) SULTAN ABDULLAH. No. 37.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL.Inclosure in No. 37. Mr. Churchill to the Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, Zanzibar, November 28, 1868. THE state of my health had so much declined towards October, which is about the most trying part of the year at Zanzibar, that I was constrained to leave Dr. Kirk in charge of the Political Agency, and proceed to sea on board Her Majesty's ship ' Star,' commanded by Captain De Kantzow, whose instructions were to proceed to Aden, touching at the ports on the African coast lying to the north of Zanzibar. By accepting the kind invitation of Captain De Kantzow to proceed to Aden with him, I thus had an opportunity of visiting the various seaport towns on the coast. I accordingly left Zanzibar on the 27th October, and after touching at Manbassa and Lamo, we reached Brava on the 4th November; there we came in with Her Majesty's ship Cf Daphne,' engaged in catching slavers. She had already taken fifteen dhows, and succeeded in getting 320 slaves. As the ' Daphne ' proposed to proceed immediately to Aden, while Captain De Kantzow w T as to remain at Brava a few davs, I passed into the u Daphne.' In the parallel of Madgeesha, the wind having unfortunately failed us and the ship having a very small quantity of coal left, we had to make our best way back to Zanzibar, which we reached on the 25th instant. I am happy to report that my health has so far improved by this short trip out at sea that I now feel well enough to resume the duties of ray office. On my arrival at Zanzibar I found the French frigate ' Armorique' in the harbour, with the Commander-in-chief of the station, Commodore Gisolme, on board. When I called on him, this officer volunteered to inform me, in the course of conver sation, that he had spoken very firmly to the Sultan of Zanzibar with reference to the affairs of Mohilla and to His Highness' policy relative thereto; he further observed that he trusted His Highness would not be induced, on any account, to allow Jumbi Fatama, the ex-Queen of that small island, to return to Mohilla' in one of His Highness' ships. I was likewise informed that, in the opinion of the French Government, the ex-Queen had acted' unwisely in rejecting the good advice given her in Paris, and it was hinted that this lady's pertinacity was, perhaps, due to a notion that she could count upon the support of Her Majesty's Government. I told Commodore Gisolme, in reply, that the letters I had received did not lead me to infer that any interference on the part of the British GGvernment in the affairs of Mohilla was contemplated, and I assured him that the Sultan should receive no advice from me tending to curtail the action of the French Government in these affairs; but I added that if the ex-Queen returned to Zanzibar she might prove a heavy burthen on Seyd Majid, if His Highness could not send her back to Mohilla in one of his own ships. Commodore Gisolme's reply was to the effect that the least semblance of support gave rise to a hostile bearing in Mohilla towards France, and as an illustration of this assertion he stated that for a whole week after the ' Daphne ' visited the island the Mohilla people kept away from Mr, Lambert. The policy of the French Government appears to be to maintain the integrity of the Lambert contract, and to oppose the ex-Queen so long as she remains hostile to French interests. To this end three French men-of-war have been told off to cruize about in the waters of Mohilla, and the Commander-in-chief proposes to establish his head-quarters at present at Mahe. it seems somewhat surprising that so great a force should be displayed for the accomplishment of so small a purpose, and it remains to be seen if some other object, connected perhaps with Madagascar, is not at the bottom of it all.

I HAVE the honour to inclose a copy of my despatch No. 237 of the 12th December, addressed to the Honourable C. Gonne, Secretary to Government, Bombay, relative to32 Sultan Majid's protest against certain captures made by Her Majesty's cruizers engaged in the suppression of the Slave Trade. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 1 in No. 38. Mr. Churchill to the Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, Zanzibar, December 12, 1868. NEWS was received a few days ago of Her Majesty's ship Star ' having destroyed thirty dhows, amongst which was a bungalow belonging to one of Seyd Majid sisters, which had some days previous to her destruction been arrested by Her Majesty's ship ' Daphne,' but was allowed to proceed on her journey for want of proof of her being a slaver. His Highness the Sultan has addressed me a letter on the subject of these seizures, which he seems to consider as arbitrary. I have replied to His Highness; but in the absence of any positive information with regard to the proceedings of the Star/' my reply is necessarily evasive. Were the ' Star's ' prizes brought before this Vice-Admiralty Court I should have an opportunity of doing justice to His Highness's demands, in the event of their being well-founded. This cannot, however, be done if the ' Star' proceeds to Aden, where a defence cannot be insisted in the absence of the defendants. The Sultan is quite right, on the other hand, in saying that his dhows are fast quitting his protection for that of the French, whose flag protects the Slave Trade by its inviolability. 1 have the honour herewith to transmit a copy of Seyd Majid's despatch to me on this subject, together with a copy of my reply. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 2 in No. 38. The Sultan of Zanzibar to Mr. Churchill. (Translation.) (After compliments.) Zanzibar, Sharban 85 {December 1868). ON a previous occasion I requested Sheik Suliman bin Ali to mention to you that some of our subjects' ships had been destroyed by Her Majesty's ships-of-war at the ports of M'gao without any show or reason for it. I now learn that the same ships-of-war have burned without causes several vessels belonging to our subjects in the neighbourhood of Brawa, even while riding at anchor in that harbour, and this solely on suspicion of their having carried slaves. I say nothing with regard to the dhows engaged in the Slave Trade, I merely refer to those that are legal traders. By Treaty Her Majesty's ships-of-war may arrest our vessels and our- subjects' vessels engaged in the Slave Trade beyond the limits of Keelwa and Lamo, but they have no right to seize and burn our ships on suspicion only, even were they unprovided with passes, or had they tanks, millet, or negro sailors in excess on board, for suspicion is not a sufficient reason to justify capture, nor is it befitting a powerful Government to condemn on mere suspicion. Were such the case, what nation would exist ? At no period of time since the first days of our government has it been the custom with us lo issue passes to our ships navigating within our own territorial waters, stating therein the number of their crews, the rank, age, distinctive marks, and wages of the same, and their passengers. Our habit has been to confine the issue of passes to the vessels of our subjects proceeding to foreign ports; and these were provided with papers stating the number of their crew, and the ports of clearance and destination only. Such has been the custom hitherto, and we have never adopted the rule stating the number of passengers on board, as such a course with us would be impracticable; for if a vessel with ten passengers, for instance, left Zanzibar for Pamba, and landed them there, and took on ether passengers to Lamo, who is there at Pamba to note these changes ? Our passes can only be written at Zanzibar, and our Seal of State cannot be entrusted out of our hands anywhere. Then with regard to the crews; they, like the passengers, are liable to be discharged, and others engaged in their stead, anywhere in our dominions, and no notecan be made of these alterations. As for water tanks, food, and cooking-pots, it is a well- known fact that the Arabs are controlled by no regular Ruler in this respect. At times they have a greater number of water vessels, and a quantity of provisions, in excess of the wants of those on board. This state of things is notorious with the Arabs ; then, again, it not unfrequently happens that a large vessel will be provided with an inadequate quantity of water-casks and cooking utensils, while others may be carrying them from port to port for the purpose of trade. Nor is an excess of millet on board a sufficient reason to justify the detention of a ship, for it can very well have been embarked as an article of commerce. T do not mean to say that, because a ship is loaded with grain, she is consequently incapable of carrying slaves, but simply that the requirements of some people are greater than those of others. With regard to the crew being black, this cannot of itself constitute a proof of the vessel bfeing engaged in the Slave Trade, for the inhabitants of these countries are mostly black, nay, they are all black except the Arabs. Now, three things I have to request of you, who are appointed by the British Govern ment in this country to look after British interests, and to decide with equity on questions in dispute ? I know perfectly well that it is not the wish of the Queen's Government to subject us, whom they consider as friends, to the oppression of the British navy ; and we are quite sure that Her Majesty's Government have no inclination to force our subjects to quit our protection, as they are doing every year, to avail themselves of the protection afforded to them by the French flag. If this state of things is to last much longer, however, there can be no doubt that every Arab dhow will necessarily be placed under French protection ; not that such could be their choice, but that they would be driven to it by the force of things, the ships of our subjects being at present in the sad predicament of either being destroyed by Her Majesty's ships-of-war, or of imploring the French to protect them with their flag. The three things I have therefore to demand of you are,—first, to put a stop to the seizing and burning of the dhows of our subjects without cause or reason ; secondly, the payment of the value of the shipping wrongfully burned by Her Majesty's ships-of-war, together with the value of their cargoes; and, thirdly, that the British navy should no longer molest the ships of our subjects found between the limits within which the carrying of slaves is allowed, namely, from Keelwa to Lamo, save during the four months at which time, in accordance with the wishes of the British Government, we have prohibited the carrying of slaves in our dominions. From your Friend, (L.S.) MAJID BIN SAID. Inclosure 3 in No. 38. Mr. Churchill to the Sultan of Zanzibar. Sir, Zanzibar, December 10, 1868. 1 HAVE received your Highness' letter of the 20th Shaban, addressed to me with reference to the recent captures of certain dhows by Her Majesty's ships of war off the coast of Brava. Your Highness is pleased, in this communication, to observe that without disputing the right of the British Government to capture your subjects' dhows when they are engaged in the Slave Trade, you cannot acquiesce in their destruction on mere suspicion of their being so employed, and you demand of me, as the Representative of Her Majesty's Government at Zanzibar, the cessation of captures on mere suspicion ; the payment of damages for shipping captured under such conditions; and the observance, in future, of your Highness' Treaty rights, according to which British cruizers are not entitled to exercise the right of capture between Keelwa and Lamo, on the coast of Zanzibar, except during the first four months of the Christian year. Your communication on this subject, which is of so important a nature to both parties, offers me an opportunity of laying before your Highness the result of my observa tions on the manner in which the Slave Trade is carried on at Brava, the very spot from whence you have received the rumours of wrongful captures having taken place. Your Highness remonstrates against the seizure of your subjects' shipping on simple suspicion, and I may confidently assure you that such a proceeding cannot be approved by the British Government. No man-of-war is justified in arresting a vessel, to whomsoever she may belong, without cause, and if Her Majesty's Government have established Vice- Admiralty Courts at various centres in the Indian Ocean, it is to examine with care the [341] K34 captures made by the British navy, and those Courts are in duty bound to award damages and costs to the owners of vessels illegally captured; but then it must be proved that such captures were illegal. Rumours alone or hearsay evidence cannot be accepted as testimony in the said Vice-Admiralty Courts, and from the experience I have in such matters, I may be allowed to say that a serious defence is scarcely ever made. The reason for this is generally to be attributed to the irrefutable nature of the evidence produced by Her Majesty's ships of war, the knowledge of which makes native captains decline any further pursuit of their rights. Then, again, in many instances, at the sight of a man-of-war, the dhows with their live cargoes on board are dashed into the foaming surf. Were they legal traders, would they thus themselves destroy their own property at the risk of their lives ? It is usually maintained in other parts of the world that the absence of papers justifies the seizure of a vessel; but the Commodore of this station has given it as his opinion that the cruizers under his command should not capture dhows on that plea alone. Nor would the fact alone of the crew being black be a sufficient reason for condemning them. In the face of such exceptional difficulties, the commanders of Her Majesty's cruizers are obliged to resort to other means of detecting the true nature of the vessels they board, and in so doing they must necessarily be guided by the fittings of the said vessels and also by the admission of the slaves themselves, who do not usually conceal the fact of their being slaves. Out of the fifteen dhows captured off Brava by Her Majesty's ship ' Daphne,' three ran ashore and were broken to pieces before the ship's boats could get up to them; their cargoes, consisting of slaves, were driven inland and escaped. The remaining twelve, captured on the high seas, had slaves on board.. I am not aware that any dhows were destroyed by the 'Daphne' without slaves. Many had passes from your Highness showing them to be respectable traders, and the greater part had taken in other merchandize besides slaves. They had come from the south, where slaves were cheap, and were proceeding towards the Benadir (Somali coast), at which places they were dear; and the native captains of the dhows may very well have vested a little capital in a private speculation without the knowledge of the owners. This circumstance, however, cannot affect the legality of the prize. Without pretending to point out to your Highness the course that should be pursued in the emergency of your subjects' vessels being placed under the French flag without your authority, allow me to observe that in my humble opinion it behoves your Highness to oppose so objectionable a proceeding, as well as to adopt such steps as will more effectually protect those of your subjects engaged in legitimate trade from the consequences of the evil acts of those who, contrary to your edicts, continue to carry on the Slave Trade; and I avail myself of this opportunity to name the Governor of Pemba as one who, though called upon to execute your Highness' orders^ nevertheless sends slaves to the north, as the inclosed letter will prove. I will conclude this letter by adding that your Highness may depend on my opposing the exercise of all arbitrary power on the part of Her Majesty's ships of war, but that I shall, at the same time, steadfastly uphold their acts when they are just and in accordance with our Treaty rights and the law of nations.

I should be glad to receive any further information which you may be able to furnish me as to the extent to which the proceedings of British cruizers employed in the suppres sion of the Slave Trade have influenced the owners of Zanzibar vessels, or the vessels of any other native States in placing them under the French flag, as well as upon the point whether the French flag is used to cover Slave Traffic, and if so to what extent.

No. 42. Mr. Churchill to Lord Stanley.—(Received March 30.) (No. 25.) My Lord Zanzibar, January 22, 1869. I HAVE the honour to inclose a copy of my despatch No. 5 of the 22nd of Januar addressed to the Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay, relative to the steps taken by me for carrying out the orders of his Excellency the Governor-General of India for the suppression of slave-dealing as carried on by Kutchees, &amp;c., residing in Zanzibar. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 1 in No. 42. Mr. Churchill to the Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. Zanzibar, January 22, 1869. I RECEIVED your despatch of the 7th ultimo relative to the possession of slaves by the Kutchees residing in Zanzibar on the 4th instant, and although I took an early opportunity of communicating the decision of the Indian Government to His Highness the Sultan, who was on the Coast of Africa at Dar Selam spending the Ramadan, I thought it better to wait until the Sultan's return to Zanzibar, as the delay incurred by this means would have the effect of reconciling His Highness with the stringent measures that I purposed taking with regard to the natives of India under his protection; I trust that my having allowed the Indians this short respite as a mark of deference to His Highness the Sultan will not be disapproved by the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, although it was, as I am aware, my duty to have acted upon the orders I had received without the least delay.36 On the day after the Sultan's return to Zanzibar, and immediately after the ' Ides ' of Ramadan, I drew up a notice informing the natives of India who had placed themselves under His Highness' protection, that they would no longer be allowed to purchase or sell slaves, and that they had to present themselves at the Consulate in order to enable me to determine whether the slaves in their possession were in domestic slavery or otherwise. It will, I fear, be a difficult matter to distinguish between domestic slavery and the real Slave Trade, as the former may assume the character of the latter at any time if domestic slavery be not kept within certain bounds. Taking my stand, therefore, on the spirit if not the letter of his Excellency the Govern or-General's opinion in this matter, I have decided that no Kutchee slave-owner should be allowed to hold more than a very limited number of domestic slaves, say two or three according to his circumstances. I beg leave to forward, for the information of his Excellency the Governor in Council, a copy of my letter to Seyd Majid on this subject, together with two notices affixed at the Custom-house and at the Consulate, that I have addressed to the Kutchees under the Sultan's protection with reference to the carrying on of the Slave Trade by them. I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to proceed along the coast in order t.o carry out more effectually the wishes of the Indian Government. The total absence at present of any British man-of-war renders my doing so, just now, impossible, and I doubt whether any of Her Majesty's ships would be available for this purpose as they come here with special instructions from the Commodore. I therefore strongly beg to suggest the expediency of sending to Zanzibar a small vessel of the Indian navy to be placed at the disposal of the Political Agent. There are many occasions on which a vessel of this kind would be invaluable at Zanzibar, and it would render the Governor's Agent much less dependent on the Sultan's goodwill in carrying out the orders of Government. A steam ship would be preferable to a sailing-ship, but the latter would be better than none at all, and I urgently venture to press the matter on the consideration of his Excellency the Governor in Council. I have, kc. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 2 in No. 42. Mr. Churchill to the Sultan of Zanzibar. (After compliments.) January 20, 1869. WITH reference to your Highness' letter of the 23rd Shaban, 1284, relative to the natives of India under your Highness' protection being amenable to British law, I have the honour to inform your Highness in writing, as I have already done verbally, that the Government of India by no means recognize the claim set up by certain Kutchees and other subjects of the Protected States in India to be emancipated from all control over them by this Political Agency on the ground that they have neglected to inscribe theii names in the Consular Registers; and I am enjoined to interfere authoritatively and by all the means at my disposal to put down slave-dealing when carried on by such persons. The majority of the Kutchees engaged in this illicit trade having placed themselves under your Highness' protection, it is necessary to inform you that I have, by a public notice, posted up at the Custom-house and at the Consulate, ordered all Kutchees and other natives of India residing in your Highness' dominions who may possess any slaves, to present themselves at this Consulate without loss of time under pain of severe punishment, in order that I may be enabled to carry out the orders of the Government of India. I have the honour to forward to you a copy of this notice, and trust that your Highness' will, on this occasion, as you have always done in other matters of a similar importance afford me your valuable co-operation in preventing the natives of India domiciled in your dominions from continuing a practice which inflicts incalculable misery on a weak and helpless population, and the existence of which is a source of much pain to Her Majesty's Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL.37 [341] Inclosure 3 in No. 42. Notice. To all Natives of India in the Dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar. THE Government of India, having taken into their serious consideration the subject of the possession of slaves and the carrying on of the Slave Trade by Kutchees and other natives of India in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have deemed it urgent to issue orders to the effect that, although domestic slavery may, for a time, be tolerated to a certain extent amongst those already possessing slaves, all attempts at purchasing, selling, or trafficking in slaves, shall be summarily put down ; and the Indian Government will not entertain any claims for redress or compensation on this head. In consequence of the issue of these orders, I, the Undersigned, Her Majesty's Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar, do hereby command all natives of India who possess slaves in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, to present themselves to this Political Agency, either in person or by deputy, within a limited period of time from this date, namely, within fourteen days for the inhabitants of the town of Zanzibar, one month for those inhabiting the Island of Zanzibar, and two months for those residing out of the said island, with a list of the slaves in their possession^ describing therein the age, sex, and name of each of their slaves in order that they may be dealt with in accordance with the commands of the Government of India. After the lapse of time allowed to each individual according to his location, unless a good and sufficient excuse be afforded for non-appearance, all slaves found in the possession of natives of India shall be forthwith set free, and the owners thereof shall further be subjected to imprisonment, or to a fine of not less than 10 dollars for each slave so found, or both.

The Queen arrived here from Aden in a native dhow a few days after the Admiral, and a few days after her arrival appeared the ' Prequet,' sent by the French Commodore of the station to look after the Queen. The Sultan's reception of the Admiral has been more than usually courteous ; on the other hand. His Highnes has received the Queen of Mobilla with marked coolness, not having yet granted her an audience, and it is reported that Seyf, the Queen s son-in-law, who has succeeded in rendering himself objectionable to the trench Government, and who is one of the Sultan's subjects, will be kept at Zanzibar. I am not aware of the intentions of the Queen, but I should think that she will, in the course of time, be allowed to return to Mohilla if she promises to remain quiet and not to interfere with the Government of that Island by her son and M. Lambert. It appears that Jumbi Fatima was offered in Paris 2,000 dollars a year, or 40,000 dollars to go back to Mohilla and remain quiet, but she foolishly refused this, and has returned to Zanzibar without having obtained any satisfaction.

As I am not aware of the nature of the decision which has been come to by the Indian Government in regard to slave-dealing and the holding of slaves by the subjects of Indian protected States, I shall be glad to be furnished with copies of any instructions on this subject which you may have received from the Government of India.

I AM directed by the Earl of Clarendon to transmit to you, to be laid before his Grace the Duke of Argyll, the accompanying copies of a despatch and its inclosures from Mr. Churchill, Her Majesty's Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar,* reporting the steps taken by him for giving effect to the orders of the Governor-General of India in regard to the suppression of slave-dealing, as carried on by Kutchees, or by the subjects of other protected Indian States residing at Zanzibar. I am to state that Lord Clarendon is not aware of the precise nature of the instructions on this subject which Mr. Churchill has received from the Government of India, but it would appear from the tenor of Mr. Churchill's despatch and its inclosures that it is proposed to tolerate, if not to recognize and allow, the holding of domestic slaves by Kutchees and other protected Indian subjects. * No. 42.39 His Lordship desires me to observe that after having once manumitted all the slaves held by protected Indian subjects at Zanzibar, as was done a few years since by Colonel Rigby, to tolerate now the holding of Slaves by any Indian subjects, protected or othewise, would be a material concession on our part towards slavery, likely to encourage the Slave Trade, and calculated to place us in a false position towards the Sultan of Zanzibar, whom we have been urging for some time past to adopt stringent measures for putting a stop to the Slave Traffic in his dominions. Lord Clarendon would suggest, therefore, unless there are any Indian interests involved which would prevent the adoption of such a course whether a notice might not be issued prohibiting entirely the holding of domestic slaves by Indian subjects, or by the subjects of any Indian State under British protection, allowing them, however, should it be thought advisable to do so, a reasonable period for getting rid of the slaves that may be in their possession. I am further directed to state that, if the Duke of Argyll has the means of furnishing it, Lord Clarendon would request to be supplied with a copy of such part of the Indian Penal Code as prohibits the holding or trafficking in slaves by Indian subjects.

It was supposed at the time that the men had deserted, but from the information I have gathered, they seem to have been overpowered by the Arabs, and were taken north to Pemba. Nothing has ever been heard of them after they were seen at Pemba, and it is presumed that they must either have been murdered or be in captivitv in some secluded part of Arabia. I have, &amp;c.

Mr. Churchill to the Political Resident, Aden. ^ ttja ™^ i , Zanzibar, February 19, 1869. i o^o V he honoui' to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th December, 18b8, with reference to the capture of an Arab dhow by Her Majesty's ship fC Star.' in which was discovered a plank on her deck marked ''Wasp,' 11-4-65/' supposed to have been written by one of the unfortunate seamen who disappeared towards that date in a dhow in which they had been placed as a prize crew. ^ depositions of the individuals sent by you as the Nakoda, and a seaman of the Mambosasa/' it would appear that this dhow formerly belonged to a native of Pemba named Rizk bin Ali. In referring to the archives of this Consulate, I find that on the 11th April, 1865, two dhows were captured near Kokotoni and Oswaeremba Point by the pinnace and the two cutters of the ' Wasp.' Dhow No. 1 had 6 Arabs and 26 slaves on board. Dhow No. 2 had a large crew, and 6 women believed to be slaves. A prize crew was put on board of dhow No. 2, but was subsequently withdrawn to rescue one of the cutters attacked by two strange Arab dhows. As a security for the safety of dhow No. 2, thus temporarily abandoned, the master and another individual, supposed to belong to the crew, but who turned out to be a passenger, were taken away with the ' Wasp's ' boats. When the attacking dhows had been driven off, dhow No. 2 was nowhere to be seen. This dhow was, at the time, proved to belong to Rizk bin Ali of Pemba, and the Nakhoda thereof was imprisoned by His Highness the Sultan, simply because he had not his pass with him when his dhow was boarded. In a letter of the 17th April, Captain Bowden, of the ' Wasp,' referring to this dhow, says that a boat was on that day sent after a dhow, which proved to be the prize No. 2 of the Uth April, whose Nakhoda was imprisoned. Captain Bowden adds, that he thinks the man had been treated unjustly, and offers to return to him his arms. This dhow is evidently the one arrested by the ' Star ' on the 8th November last, and in till likelihood the carving was made by the ' Wasp's ' men when they were on board of her on the 11th April, 1865. In the same letter of the 17th April, Captain Bow T den informs Colonel Playfair that the missing dhow had not yet turned up; and it this missing dhow, boarded after the 11th April, and described as having a crew of 2 Arabs and 3 slaves only, of w^hom two were boys (and, consequently, different from the one that had a large crew and 6 women on board) that slipped off with a prize crew of three men who have never been heard of since. This dhow is further said to have had her yard damaged by a shot from the pinnace, a circumstance which is not mentioned in connection with dhow No. 2. It was subsequently ascertained, I find, though it does not appear in the corre spondence, that the crew of this latter dhow, having overcome the sailors, and having bound them hand and foot, and had proceeded to Pemba, where it was notorious at the time that three English sailors had been captured by some Soori Arabs. Researches having been made on the Coast of Arabia, in consequence of Colonel Playfair's representations to the Government of Bombay, it was ascertained by Colonels Pelly and Disbrowe that this dhow belonged to one Rabai bin Alii, of Soor, who is now dead. The prisoners sent down to Zanzibar declared in their depositions before me that, although eight of the ' Mambosasa ' crew were slaves, their dhow was not engaged in the the Slave Trade, and the Sultan purposes protesting against her being destroyed by Captain de Kantzow.

IN the course of a conversation I had with Seyd Majid, soon after the arrival of Her Majesty's ship ^Nymphe/' His Highness having, with reference to the manner in which I proposed to carry out my instructions relative to the Kutchees under the Sultan's protection possessing slaves, expressed in strong terms his misgivings as to the friendly feelings of his subjects towards himself and the Europeans, because of the prevailing belief that Her Majesty's Government would sooner or later end in forcing His Highness to sanction the abolition of domestic slavery in his dominions, an event which would, said the Sultan, bring about the total ruin of the country. I deemed it advisable to request Commander Meara, of the Nymphe,' to postpone his cruise south until I could see my wav through the difficulty. __. * , „ ii Finding, however, after a lapse of ten days, that His Highness fears were groundless, inasmuch as the Arabs were quite indifferent if the natives of Kutch held slaves or not in Zanzibar, and that His Highness has merely wished to throw difficulties in my way, 1 authorized Commander Meara to proceed on his cruizing tour. I availed myself of his passing by Johanna to request him to grant a passage to Seyd Ali, the brother of the King of Johanna, who was desirous, with his cousin, to return to his native island. _ _ , . ^ j I have the honour to transmit to you copies of the letters I addressed to Commander Meara on this subject, and I trust that my having detained the ' Nymphe,' under the peculiar circumstances described, will meet with the approval of his Excellency the Governor in Council. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 2 in No. 50. Mr. Churchill to Commander Meara. g- r Zanzibar, February 3, 1869. IN consequence of the very serious apprehensions apparently entertained by His Highness Seyd Majid, the Sultan of Zanzibar, as to the public tranquillity of the place, if I persevere in carrying out certain instructions that I have recently received from the Government of Bombay, connected with the suppression of the Slave Trade on this coast, and not feeling myself justified in deviating in the least degree from the line of conduct traced out to me, I deem it urgent to request you to postpone your departure from this until it may be seen how far the Sultan's apprehensions are founded. Under any circumstances the presence of a British man-of-war in the port of Zanzibar at this season of the year, when the Arabs of the coast of Arabia visit these shores in vast numbers for the purpose of carrying away into slavery the black population of this country, is desirable; and I trust that these two reasons together w T ill have sufficient weight in them to prevail upon you to remain here, for the present at all events. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 3 in No. 50. Mr. Churchill to Commander Meara. gj r Zanzibary February 12, 1869. THE apprehensions entertained By His Highness the Sultan as to the possibility of disturbances occurring at Zanzibar, having been found to be of an indefinite nature, and having failed to detect the specious grounds on which His Highness bases his fears lest a commotion should take place calculated to compromise the Sultan's position and the lives of the European inhabitants of Zanzibar, I beg you will consider yourself under no further moral obligation to remain here for the protection of the place. In proceeding south you will necessarily pass by Johanna, an island whose Chief has43 invariably shown himself well-disposed towards England. The position of Johanna, moreover, in the close neighbourhood of the French possessions of Mayotta and Nosse-b*?, renders it not a little desirable that we should propitiate this friendly feeling. I have therefore the honour to request that you will kindly give King Abdalla's brother, Seyd Ali, and his cousin, a passage to Johanna, if you can do so conveniently. The King will, I feel sure, be glad to see you at Johanna should you call on him. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. No. 51. Mr. Churchill to the Earl of Clarendon.—{Received April 17.)

REFERRING to the natives of India holding slaves in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, 1 had the honour, in my despatch of the 21st January last, to report the steps that I had taken with a view to put a stop to the Trafficking in Slaves by the same individuals within the jurisdiction of this Political Agency. I was aware that I could not count upon the co-operation of Seyd Majid in carrying out my instructions; but, however much I required that co-operation, I was determined to do without it, if His Highness withheld it. Soon after the publication of my notices (annexed to my despatch of the 21st of January), a native of Kutch was reported to me as having put up one of his slaves for sale in the market-place. The man was one of those protected by the Sultan. 1 caused him to be arrested, and brought to trial. He did not deny the fact, but laughingly declared that he ignored my power to punish him. I sentenced him to a fine of 500 dollars, and to imprisonment in the fort until I could send him out of the country. This decisive measure, which I was prepared to follow up by others of the same nature, brought the Kutchees to their senses ; and after a serious consultation, the principal amongst them came to the Consulate to declare the slaves they held; while the Sultan, careless of showing his vexation, addressed me a letter couched in very^ plain words, such as he is not in the habit of writing to this Political Agency, in which he protested with energy against my proceedings and threatened to report me. I replied on the same day, expressing to His Highness my regret at the line of policy he had been pleased to adopt, but showing him that I would not abandon the position I had assumed. I took an early opportunity to wait upon His Highness in person, to impress upon his mind the futility of opposing the fulfilment of my instructions; and, as in the course of this interview, His Highness urged the dissatisfaction of his subjects with himself and this Agency, and his distrust of the maintenance of the public peace if I persisted, I requested Commander Meara, of Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe,' to remain at Zanzibar till further orders. Matters were in this position, and I had made every preparation to avert the possibility of Kutchees engaging in the Slave Trade, by depriving them of the slaves in their possession, over and above a certain number, when, on the 13th February, I received your letter of the 16th January, by which I am informed that it is unnecessary to interfere with the existing arrangements, by which domestic slaves are now actually possessed by Kutchees at Zanzibar, for household purposes. From the tenor of this Resolution, I concluded that I had misinterpreted the sense of44 the Governor-General's letter to the Bombay Government, of the 6th November, and that I was going too far in compassing the freedom of any of the slaves held by the Kutchees, although the possession of a large number of slaves would offer facilities to the traffic which I could not control, otherwise than by reducing the number of domestic slaves to a minimum, and getting a correct list and description of them. I therefore called the Sultan's Secretary, and, without letting him know that I had overstepped the limits of my powers, I requested him to convey to the Sultan my wish to conciliate matters, and my readiness, considering the assistance we had invariably received from His Highness in putting down the Slave Trade, to abstain from interference with the slaves already in the hands of the Kutchees under his protection, provided His Highness would afford me his co-operation in punishing them if they sold or bought slaves in his dominions. The Sultan appeared to be gratified at this concession ; and on the 20th February I embodied my conditions in a letter to the above effect; to which Seyd Majid replied, by accepting my conditions provisionally, pending reference to the Government of Bombay. I have the honour to forward herewith, inclosed copies of the correspondence above- mentioned. As matters stand, I do not interfere with the slaves actually held by Kutchees protected by Seyd Majid, though I have established my right to jurisdiction over them in the event of their engaging in the Slave Trade. I have offered to press upon the consideration of his Excellency, the Governor of Bombay, our non-interference with them, if His Highness will punish them himself, whenever they purchase or sell slaves. I have reserved to this Agency the right to interfere in the event of His Highness being remiss in carrying out his engagements. I have further, in accordance with the views expressed by his Excellency the Governor-General, closed the door upon future arrivals from India being protected by the Sultan. This latter clause is the one most objected to by the Zanzibar Government, for it will have the effect of restoring to the British Political Agency the influence and power it formerly possessed, which was beginning to diminish in consequence of our gradually losing the hold we had at one time over the Indian element of the population, which is not inconsiderable. In reply that his Excellency the Governor-General will give to the Sultan's Deputy, will depend the question whether this influence is to be increased or totally annulled, in the course of time.

YOU addressed us some time since with reference to the Indians under our protec tion and it was our intention to have answered you, when we learned that you had put up a notice at the Custom-house without waiting our reply, and now we are informed that you have imprisoned one of the Indians in question. Now let it be known to you that we protest against this measure, and shall not assist you in compelling our subjects and those under our protection to free their slaves; and in the event of your forcing them to do so it will be against our will, and we shall be constrained to address a complaint of such proceedings to Her Majesty's Government. Be this known to you. Written on the 17th Shawal, 1285. From your Friend, MAJID BIN SAEED. Inclosure 3 in No. 51. Mr. Churchill to the Sultan of Zanzibar. (After the usual compliments.) Zanzibar, February 1, 1869. I HAVE had the honour to receive your Highness' letter of the 17th Shawal, relative to the measures that I have been instructed by the Government of India to take with a view to putting down the Trade in Slaves, which I lament to say is carried on in45 [341] N your Highness' dominions by certain natives of India under your Highness' protection. Your Highness has been pleased therein to protest against the adoption of such measures, and I am informed that 1 am not to expect any co-operation from you in carrying out my instructions, but that, on the contrary, you will be compelled to complain against me if I persist in freeing the slaves of the natives of India under your protection. Your Highness will allow me, in the first place, to express my deep regret that ten days should have been allowed to pass without my being informed whether or no I could count upon your Highness' assistance in fulfilling the instructions of Government, and I now see with much pain that that assistance which you promised me when the question of the possession of slaves by the natives of India in Zanzibar was first mooted, is now withheld. I would now fain to bring to your Highness' recollection the agreement that was then made, namely, that the. question should be referred to the Government of [ndia for their decision, promising me your aid in carrying out the wishes of Government in the event of their being in conformity with my view of the question, and with this result in contemplation, your Highness was pleased to put up a notice forbidding all natives of India under your protection from selling their slaves, or otherwise getting rid of them before a reply came, and a list of the slaves of the said Indians was drawn up by your orders to serve as a check against their selling them. If now, after these promises, I do not receive at your hands that amount of assistance that is due to the Agent of the British Government to enable him to carry out his instructions in a proper manner, I shall be under the painful necessity of bringing the circumstance to the serious notice of Her Majesty's Government, who, it is needless for me to tell you, will be greatly pained to witness the attitude of your Highness in this matter. This Agency does not in the least wish to interfere with your Highness' subjects, but the natives of India who, in order to carry on the Slave Trade, have placed themselves under your protection are not your subjects, and they cannot be admitted as such. With regard to the individual whom I caused to be arrested for an attempt to sell one of his slaves, he is a native of India and amenable to British law, and it having been proved before the British Consular Court, in his own presence, and, furthermore, admitted by himself, that he purposed selling his slave in the public slave-market, by virtue of the powers vested in me by Her Majesty's Government, I have sentenced him to a fine of 500 dollars and to imprisonment until a suitable opportunity offers to send him to India. Should your Highness object to keep the man in the fort you will be pleased to tell me so. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 4 in No. 51, Mr. Churchill to the Sultan of Zanzibar. (After the usual compliments.) Zanzibar, February 20, 1869. I HAVE already conveyed to your Highness verbally, through your Secretary Suliman bin Ali, the course I propose to follow with reference to the Kutchees and other natives of India holding slaves in your dominions, and I now have the honour to inform you in writing that, taking into consideration your Highness' goodwill with regard to the ultimate abolition of the Slave Trade on this coast, 1 am anxious to carry out the instruc tions of the Bombay Government in a manner agreeable to your Highness. With this object in view, I will not object to allow the Kutchees under your protection the possession of the slaves they now hold, as shown in the register kept by Suliman bin Ali, provided they do not buy any more or sell those they have. This concession will have the effect of covering your Highness' amour propre, for, .so long as the Kutchees under your protection do not traffic in slaves, I shall not interfere with them; but in order to keep a check over them, I should wish your Highness to order them to give you the names and description of their slaves. Any Kutchee under your protection purchasing a slave or selling one shall be deemed to have committed a heinous crime, and shall be amenable to British jurisdiction; but if your Highness will pledge yourself to punish such individuals condignly, I will gladly suggest to the Bombay Government our non-interference. All future arrivals from India shall be deemed amenable to British law in every way, and there shall be no excuse for their purchasing or holding slaves in your Hiohness' dominions. D46 I shall also suggest, in compliance with your wishes, that natives of Zanzibar born of Indian parents may be allowed to elect their nationality after coming of age; and that the Kutchees settled in Zanzibar before 1836, the date of the Rao's Proclamation regarding the Slave Trade, may be permitted to enjoy all the privileges of your Highness' subiects. (Signed) HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 5 in No. 51. The Sultan of Zanzibar to Mr. Churchill. (Translation.) (After the usual compliments.) Zanzibar, 12 Thil Karda, 1285 (February 26, 1869). YOUR letter has reached us, and its contents have been understood. Our friend Soliman conveyed to us your verbal message, and it was in exact accordance with the purport of your letter, namely, that you would allow the natives of Kutch to keep what slaves they had as a mark of deference towards us. We have to express to you our sincere thanks for this ; we believe that you are well disposed towards us, and we earnestly trust that the friendship happily existing between us will increase daily ; but the correspondence that passed between our Government and Colonels Pelly and Playfair, some time back, acknowledges our right to protect all natives of Kutch whose names are not inscribed in the Consular Register Books kept in Zanzibar, and to consider them as our own subjects in every way. You, however, latterly wished to pursue another course; and it was then agreed to refer the matter to the Indian Government. When, a few days ago &gt; you insisted on taking active measures in the matter, we purposed sending some one to the Govern ment of India to represent our case. You further state that, in future, all new arrivals from India shall be amenable to British law. We can easily understand that the natives of Bombay and Surat, and other parts of India subjugated by Great Britain, should be subject to your jurisdiction ; but that that those who come from States that have not been conquered should be amenable to British law is at variance with the explanations previously given by Colonels Pelly and Playfair, namely, that if they have not elected the protection of the British Consulate, by writing their names in the Consular Register, their status shall be that of the Arabs, our subjects. Now, however, with a view to the maintenance of the friendly relations between us, we are willing to accept the position assumed by you, as explained in your letter under present acknowledgment, until such time as our Envoy may return from India, when we trust that the most perfect understanding will be arrived at on this subject between us. This is from your friend Majid bin Saeed. No. 52. Mr. Churchill to the Earl of Clarendon.—{Received April 17.) (No. 7.) My Lord, Zanzibar, February 27, 1869. I HAVE the honour to inclose a copy of my despatch No. 20 of the 27th February, addressed to the Acting Chief Secretary, Bombay, relative to the mission of Seyd Mahomed bin Salim to London and his return to Zanzibar. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) HY A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure in No. 52. Mr. Churchill to the Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay Sir, Zanzibar, February 26, 1869. MAHOMED BIN SALIM, the Sultan's Envoy to Her Majesty's Court in London, returned to Zanzibar on the 11th instant. He has brought me no letters, so that I am unacquainted officially with the result of his mission ; but from the Queen's letter to Seyd Majid, and Lord Clarendon's communica tion to His Highness, of which I have been allowed to take copies, which I have the47 honour to forward to you herein inclosed, I gather that Seyd Mahomed's mission has not been very successful. The Envoy states, however, that after the letters above mentioned were confided to him, he was received by Her Majesty in a most flattering manner, and that he was told by his Grace the Duke of Argyll, with reference to the subsidy, that, viewing the turn affairs had latterly taken in Oman, it was not likely that Her Majesty's Government would press Seyd Majid to continue its payment, and that his Grace had written in that sense to the Government of India. His Highness the Sultan appears to have derived much gratification from the hope that is thus thrown out to him of ridding himself and his successors of the payment of a subsidy to Muscat, and I learn that he purposes sending an Envoy to Bombay, to the Right Honourable Sir Seymour Fitzgerald to plead his case before his Excellency as well as with reference to the cessation of the subsidy as to the usurpation of Throne of Muscat by one who does not belong to the Bue-Facedi family, His Highness has expressed a wish that 1 should see the Arabs who have latterly come from the shores of Arabia to invite him to wrest the Throne of Muscat out of the hands of Azan, but I have refused to hear them lest they should be led to believe that the undertaking might possibly be allowed by Her Majesty's Government. Indeed, I have expressed myself in strong terms against the very notion of an invasion of Muscat from Zanzibar, but I must admit that the feeling is strong in favour of an expedition to Muscat. The Muscat refugees without exception—and they are not a few—assure the Sultan that he has only to present himself in Oman to assure success; and mistaking the Sultan's silent inclination to the scheme for his assent, they have spread the report that after the aid of Kourhan, a month hence, he is to lead an expedition to Muscat, and the scarcity of money in Zanzibar of late has given a colour to this extravagant notion, I am assured that however much the scheme is popular and feasible in the mind of Seyd Majidj His Highness would not think of embarking in so bold an undertaking without the consent of the British Government, and I have taken great care to let him understand that it would not be tolerated, and that if he made the attempt he might make up his mind never to return to Zanzibar. I do not believe His Highness would allow himself to be carried away on so perilous an enterprise by the flattery with which he is surrounded, although he has at his disposal three sailing ships of war, mounting seventy-four guns, besides two steamers, of which one is the ' Shenandoah,' well known during the recent American war, and several sailing- vessels which might be employed as transports. ( It will end, I presume, by his emptying his packets of the superfluous gold into the greedy hands of his sycophants; but I am thinking that if any step antagonistic to the policy of Her Majesty's Government were really to be contemplated, I should, under present circumstances, without any vessel of war at my disposal, be somewhat at a loss to check it, or even to communicate with Aden or the Seychelles to give timely notice of its existence; and this is a state of helplessness that I venture to bring strongly to the consideration of his Excellency the Governor in Council.

HIS Highness the Sultan has been good enough to permit me to take a copy of a letter he has received from Sheikh Ibrahim bin Sultan, Chief of the Beni Yaa's tribe, whose head-quarters are at Abu Phabbei, in the Persian Gulf. The letter relates as much to the Slave Trade as to the feelings of the tribes on the coast of Arabia towards Seyd Majid as their future ruler. The inducements to carry on the Slave Trade are brought out with great force in the Sheikh's letter. His inability to stop it may or may not be feigned, but the information conveyed to us by his remarks go far to show that, until serious measures are taken, as well in the Persian Gulf as elsewhere, to punish the individuals who engage in this Traffic it will continue its course unaffected by our efforts to annihilate it. It comes, I am afraid, to this, that so long as domestic slavery is allowed to flourish, the Slave Trade will exist. In no Mahometan state with which Her Majesty's Government is in friendly relations should domestic slavery be tolerated. The alliance of England is worth the sacrifice. Until then, our endeavours, however active and energetic, will no more keep this trade down, than grass will be stopped from growing by being trampled upon. Like vice of every kind, it will crop up wherever it has not been thoroughly eradicated. I n£l\7^ iV C* (Signed) ' HY. A. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 2 in No. 53.

YOU are no doubt aware of the occurrences of Oman, and what has taken place at Muscat, but we are ignorant of your intentions, though the people of Oman are all looking towards you. We trust that you will let us know what you purpose doing. Seyd Salim hr;S come to Abu Phabbei with the object of getting the people to rise in his favour, but we do not believe he will succeed in inducing them to fight for him, as his proceedings in past times were not of the best; however, everything is in the hands of the Almighty. Your gracious letter has reached me, and I was pleased to receive tidings of your health. Its main purport, namely, that we should warn the Northern Arabs from going to Zanzibar, has been understood. We did warn them, oh, my brother, and sent people to tell them, and made public your letter; but it will, I am afraid, have but little effect in keeping them back. The gains are so enormous that it is hopeless to think of stopping them. With ten baskets' worth of dates, that a man gets on credit, he can get 20 slaves at Zanzibar, worth 1,000 dollars. God is great. You may punish them condignly, if you like, by burning their dhows, or by putting them in irons, but if you do not punish them you had better let them alone, for we cannot do it. The greatest offenders are the people ot Ras-el-Kheyma; were they put down, the others would soon stop ; but words are not sufficient; on the contrary, words will increase their daring; but vour consideration is superior to all.

WITH reference to your letter of the 10th instant, and to my reply dated 12th idem, I am now directed by the Duke of Argyll to forward, for the information of Lord Clarendon, copy of a despatch just received from the Government of India, with inclosure from the Government of Bombay, on the subject of the Zanzibar subsidy. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) M. E. GRANT DUFF.51 49 Inclosure 1 in No. 54. The Secretary to Government, Bombay, to the Secretary to the Government of India. (No. 86.) March 10, 1869. I AM directed to acknowledge your letter of 5th ultimo, forwarding copy of a despatch from Her Majesty's Secretary of State relative to the annual subsidy paid by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Sultan of Muscat, and requesting an expression of the views of the Bombay Government on the several points raised by his Grace the Duke of Argyll. 2. The first question is, how far the faith of the British Government in India is pledged to enforce payment of the subsidy by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the present Ruler of Muscat. 3. It is suggested that although it was expressly stated in Lord Canning's award that the annual payment of 40,000 crowns was not to be understood as merely personal between the two Sultans Majid and Thoweynee, but was to extend to their respective successors, yet the fact of the term ' inheritances ' being applied to the possessions of the two Sultans, the inequality in which was to be adjusted by the annual payment, makes it doubtful whether the subsidy should still be considered as due from Zanzibar after the changes which have occurred in the ruling power at Muscat. 4. If this question is to be settled by a reference to the intention of Lord Canning, so far as this can be ascertained, it will be difficult to support the view that the term ' successors' should be interpreted with the limitation suggested. It was shown by General Coghlan that constitutionally there could not be such a thing as a succession by inheritance to the Sultanat of either Muscat or Zanzibar, the validity of each succession being dependent on the will of the Arab tribes. Moreover the question of the succession to Syud Majid was discussed and was disposed of by the Government of India saying, that to offer any opinion about the rale of succession^ in Zanzibar would be travelling beyond the bounds of the question submitted for arbitration. (Vide paragraph 6 of Government of India's letter of 2nd April, 1861.) 5. As further showing that the term ' successors ' was used without any limitation as to the mode of succession, it may be noted that the permanency of the subsidy was made an article of the award rather out of policy than as settling any point in the dispute between the two Sultans. The dispute which led to the arbitration arose out of an arrangement for the payment of the subsidy, of which General Coghlan wrote in his 45th paragraph: ' The arrangement as it stands has respect to the two brothers only; no provision whatever being made that it should continue in force beyond their own life time.' And he added that ' the strict letter of all we know of the mutual agreement might be held to sanction that limitation but he then goes on to argue that the arrange ment ought to have been made as between the two States, and not merely as between the two brothers Majid and Thoweynee. And this view was adopted by the Bombay Govern ment, who wrote in paragraph 14 of their Resolution : ' Syud Thoweynee can hardly with honour resign the claims of his country, not merely his own claims, for a payment which is to determine with his own life.' It is clear, therefore, that the British Govern ment, holding that it was for the true interests of both States that a permanent motive should be given to Muscat to abstain from ambitious movements against Zanzibar, and holding also that it was for their own interests that the power of Muscat in the Persian Gulf should be permanently increased by the subsidy from Zanzibar, supplemented the arrangement made between the two brothers by declaring that it should hold good between their successors as well as between themselves. 6. It must be observed, further, that, in stating the terms which he submitted for adoption in order to settle the dispute between the two Sultans, General Coghlan did not use the word ' inheritances,' or any expression tending to limit his recommendation to an arrangement between families of the two Sultans; and the Government of Bombay, in submitting their opinion to the Government of India, in accordance with General Coghlan's recommendations, in the same manner evidently contemplated a permanent arrangement in no way dependent on any question of succession by inheritance as regards either Oman or Zanzibar. General Coghlan, indeed, suggested, in order to prevent any reopening of the dispute between the two States, that the Government of India should insist upon a subsidiary term being adopted to the effect that no cause whatever, other than an open attempt on the part of Seyd Thoweynee or his successors to infringe the independence of Zanzibar sovereignty, should be held to justify Syed Majid or his successors in with holding the stipulated subsidy. 7. In dealing with the third paragraph of the Secretarv of State's letter, it appears [341] Oto his Excellency in Council that his Grace is under some misapprehension as to what has lately occurred at Muscat. His Excellency in Council thinks that he is premature in considering that Seyd Azan bin Ghes can be considered as the successor of Seyd Salim, although for the present he appears to have partially established himself at Muscat; and, at any rate, the revolution which has taken place cannot be considered as a conquest of Muscat by the Wahabee Arab of the interior. Although holding some religious tenets in common with them, he is, on the contrary, hostile to the Wahabee power, and it is probable that, if the deposed Sultan regains power, it will be owing to Wahabee aid. 8. Without, therefore, going so far as to say that it is impossible that any such changes or revolutions should occur in the ruling power of Muscat as to render the decision of Lord Canning inapplicable, his Excellency in Council is clearly of opinion that, under the circumstances which now exist, the subsidy has not ceased to be legally payable according to the terms of the arbitration. 9. The question how far the faith of the British Government in India is pledged to enforce payment of the subsidy by the Sultan of Zanzibar, as stated in paragraph 6 of the Secretary of State's despatch, does not present itself to his Excellency in Council exactly in the form suggested in paragraph 7. The Secretary of State intimates that the question will arise as to whether the Government would be justified in refusing to allow the Sultan of Zanzibar to get rid of his liability to pay the subsidy by war. It is probable, however, that, if British compulsion were removed, the Sultan of Zanzibar would simply cease paying the subsidy, and the question which the Government would have to decide would be, whether they would be justified in refusing to the Sultan of Muscat the opportunity of enforcing his rights by war. His Excellency in Council is of opinion that in such a refusal the Government would not be justified. In connection with this subject, I am directed to draw attention to a letter of 20th November last, from the Acting Political Agent at Muscat, herewith inclosed. 10. As regards the second of the two questions stated by the Secretary of State in his 6th paragraph, namely, how far we have any political interest in desiring that the subsidy should continue to be paid, it appears to his Excellency in Council that the same reasons which existed when the arrangement was made exist now, and therefore, as a matter of policy, the payment of the subsidy to Muscat ought to be continued. 11. The question then arises whether we ought to take this payment on ourselves. In his paragraph 9 the Secretary of State suggests that by doing so we might secure adequate advantage on the side both of Zanzibar and Muscat to compensate us for the sacrifice. He adds that the payment, if assumed by us, would be a charge on the Indian revenues. 12. The advantage to be gained as regards Zanzibar is certain concessions in respect to the Slave Trade to which Her Majesty's Government attach a high value. But it appears to his Excellency in Council that this is so clearly an object of Imperial interest, that the revenues of India could not be justly charged with any payment in order to secure it; and his Excellency in Council would add that he believes this is the first time that a proposition has been made to burden the Indian revenues for such an object. 13. On the side of Muscat, the Secretary of State intimates that we might obtain important conditions as regards the peace and security of the Persian Gulf, which would amount to an equivalent of the money expended. His Excellency in Council would, however, observe that we obtain these conditions already by Treaty, and he does not see what further concessions could be obtained from Muscat in this direction which we do not possess already. If it is argued that, beyond the conditions referred to, the payment of the subsidy to Muscat would be advantageous to India by preventing serious complica tions in the Persian Gulf, his Excellency in Council believes that the same amount might be expended much more advantageously by placing at the disposal of the Government a force sufficient to insure that the existing Treaty should be observed, and to prevent any complications arising that may disturb the peace in the Persian Gulf. 14. Reviewing the whole circumstances, his Excellency in Council does not hesitate to express the opinion that it is undesirable that the existing relations between Zanzibar and Muscat should be disturbed.Inclosure 2 in No. 54. The Acting Political Agent, Muscat, to the Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. (No. 523.) November 20, 1868. WHILE Saleh-ben-Ali was with me yesterday, as reported in my letter of this date, he led the conversation on the subject of Zanzibar by alluding to the mission of Mahomed- ben-Salim to England, for the purpose of relieving His Highness Seyd Majid, if possible s from further payments of the subsidy to Muscat. He also alluded to the property possessed there by Muscat people, and his fears that it might be confiscated by Seyd Majid. He ended by stating that an expedition to Zanzibar would be so popular that he would experience no difficulty in getting 50,000 men to take part in it. 2. I pointed out to him that the Government of India had insisted on Seyd Majid fulfilling his part of the arbitration agreement with this State by causing him to pay, much against his will, all arrears of subsidy due to Seyd Salim, and that, whilst he might rely on strict justice being meted out to this State in every dispute arising with Zanzibar, it was my opinion that the Government of India would at once put a stop to apy movement against the territory of Seyd Majid. 3. I further told him that the wild talk in the town for the last fortnight had not been lost on me, but that T had already warned Government that some such undertaking was contemplated. He said he had not thought of sending a force, but of going himself to Zanzibar to look after his interests there, and asked, if he went down as passenger in a British ship, whether the British would prevent Seyd Majid seizing him. 1 answered, I thought it probable that the Political Agent at that place would himself surrender him to His Highness Seyd Majid if he attempted any such thing. He thereupon laughed and turned the conversation. 4. I have considered it my duty to bring this short conversation to the notice of Government, as, though it was not meant to be in the least official, it confirms my fears, as previously reported in my letter of the 14th November. It is evident to me that this people dread not only the loss of the annual subsidy but also the confiscation of the property in Zanzibar of its individual members. In their present temper, thereforej I am strongly of opinion that Government should, if possible, take the precaution of relieving their minds from all apprehensions on these points, as the departure of Mahomed-ben- Salim's mission to Europe has been unfortunately specially ill-timed; and if it is success ful, and no compensation is given to this State for the loss of its subsidy, we could not with justice interfere to prevent the nation asserting their assumed rights by force. Seyd Majid would then, I am afraid, find that the annual payment of 40,000 dollars was a cheap premium to insure the peace of his dominions. 5. Whilst I bring my fears to their notice, I trust I can confidently assure Govern ment that no expedition will be permitted to leave while I have the honour to represent them at Muscat; but, at the same time, I must point out that it will be impossible to prevent the departure of emissaries for Zanzibar if these people are goaded into taking extreme measures. I therefore earnestly, beg of them to do their utmost to prevail on Seyd Majid to abandon all idea of being relieved from future payments of the subsidy, and advise him to take especial care not to irritate this people by proceeding to measures of confiscation, as in the case of Seyd Hillal—measures to support which he cannot have the pretence of a right to offer, and which cannot now be carried out with impunity, as in the time of the weak Seyd Salim. Inclosure 3 in No. 54. The Acting Political Agent, Muscat, to the Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. (No. 516.) November 14, 1868. I HAVE the honour to address Government on a matter which I think should attract their attention, as it relates to a contingency by no means remote, viz., an attempt to revolutionize Zanzibar by the parties who have been so successful in this respect at Muscat. I am the more induced to bring my fears to the notice of Government, as I apprehend the events which have transpired here may cause Seyd Majid to confiscate the property of Sheikhs Saleh-bin-Ali and Saeed-bin-Ali, and others of the Al-Harth and different tribes who own large sugar and clove plantations in his territory. A reference to my letter dated 22nd June last, will show that His Highness Seyd Majid is not incapable of such conduct.52 2. As directly bearing on this point, I would refer the Right Honourable the Governor in Council to the views expressed by Sir W. M. Coghlan in the Proceedings of the Zanzibar Commission, in ray humble opinion the soundest that have ever been written on all questions relating to Oman. On pages 69 and 70 he states' Colonel Rigby, in his account of the preparation made by Seyd Majid to resist the expected invasion, repre sents the means at the disposal of the latter as ample to destroy any force brought against him, dwelling especially on the enthusiasm of the people in his cause. Subsequently, however, and long after the expedition of Seyd Thoweynee had returned to Muscat, his report of the state of affairs at Zanzibar led Government to conclude that the position of Seyd Majid was not secure,* and later still, on the occasion of the outbreak, when the Al-Harth Arabs rose in support of Seyd Bargash, all the force which Seyd Majid could bring against them was ineffectual, and the rising was not suppressed until assistance from three British men-of-war had been sent to co-operate with them, when, as it is averred, the Arabs yielded because they would not fight against the British.f Subsequent inquiry confirms me, rather than otherwise, in the obvious drift ot the foregoing quotation. The elaborate account given by His Highness Seyd MajidJ of the insurrection at Zanzibar in October 1859, divested of its vain colouring, shows that he was hard pressed by the insurgents, and Colonel Rigby, in attempting to reconcile a former statement of his, that the faction opposed to Majid was utterly contemptible with the position which that faction had secured on the occasion referred to, renders it highly probable that, without the opportune assistance of the British, the struggle would have been prolonged and the final result at least doubtful. § 38. On the other hand, it is by no means certain that the success ot the insurgents would have placed Zanzibar in the hands of Seyd Thoweynee. Colonel Rigby is of opinion that the Al-Harth were actuated by private aims, and availed themselves of Seyd Thoweynee's antagoni&amp;m to Seyd Majid, not for his sake, but for their own, anxious, if possible, to get rid of the whole family ot the late Imam. H 3. I do not pretend to any knowledge of Zanzibar, or of the state of the parties there, but I would beg Government to remember that it is an open town; that danger threatened Seyd Majid, on the occasion above referred to, from the Al-Harth tribe, of whom Saleh-bin-Ali, the man who plotted and so successfully carried out the late revolu tion here, is an inHuential chief; that this man himself took an important part in those events, and had to leave Zanzibar on that account; and that it is by no means impossible that the religious sentiment which has lately been so conspicuous here will be carried across the ocean, and play a part equally remarkable amongst the Arabs on the continent of 4. I feel convinced that it is from no spirit of mere braggadocio that such a scheme is now openly talked of in Muscat, but that the idea has taken root in the minds of the Chiefs, and is popular with their followers. It can, moreover, I fancy, be easily w r orked out by' those with whom it emanated, as a few emissaries sent to Zanzibar in the name of the Imam are likely to be all that is required. The priests would probably be easily gained over, and there, as here, the Chiefs and people would follow. 5. It is therefore from no idea of exciting alaam, or of exaggerating the power and objects of the late movement, that I have penned this Report, but to put Government on their guard against a contingency by no means remote, and with a hope that they will warn Seyd Majid that any infringement of international rights, as in the case of Seyd Hillal, who has been identified with this movement from the first, in the cases of any persons who have been concerned in bringing about the late revolution, will most probably be visited on his head, if not by expulsion, at least by an attempt on the part {sic) to subvert his authority. * Resolution of the Honourable Board, November 16, 1859. f Muscat Report, paragraph 24.

In using the word ' inheritances/' Lord Canning, it seems probable to us, merely meant to indicate that the then disputant parties claimed to succeed by * Enclosure 5 of Political Despatch No. 165 of 1861 :— • ^ j '5. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recognition of any dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither is it to be considered as merely personal between Syud Thowanee and by d Maiid but as a permanent arrangement, compensath'.g the Ruler of Muscat for the abandonmen o G upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequalities between the two inheritaiaees, which are to be henceforward separate. ^ Governor .

We are further of opinion, that the recent events which have occurred in Muscat ought not to be considered as having altered the relations between the two State?, as far as this subsidy is concerned. We also think that the honour and good faith of the British Government are pledged to the continued payment of the subsidy, and that the political reasons which induced Lord Canning to effect the arrangement still exist in all their force and intensity. 6.

I HAVE read with much interest, and considered with all the attention which the importance of the subject demands, the despatch of your Excellency's Government No. 100 of the 20th of March, 1869, with inclosure from the Government of Bombay, respecting the existing relations between Muscat and Zanzibar, especially in regard to the continued payment of the subsidy by the latter to the former State. Her Majesty's Government have never, at any time, regarded the agreement entered into by the sons of Syud Saeed, under the arbitrament of the British Government in the light of a personal compact; and they were not disposed, therefore, so long as any direct successor of that Chief, should hold possession of Muscat, to declare that in their opinion the Ruler of Zanzibar was no longer under an obligation to pay the annual subsidy. But * /^hey have not considered that this obligation was an inheritable one, which no circum- M^^^^stances could affect; that if Muscat should fall into the hands of a foreign ruler or one with no hereditary claims to its possession, it would be incumbent on the British Govern ment to maintain the original award. It would not be without just ground of complaint that the Ruler of Zanzibar would, in such a case, find himself called upon to contribute to the support of a Chief who has no claim upon his friendship on the score of kindred, and whose interests may be altogether antagonistic to his own. It appears to me that it was always intended that some dynastical limitations should restrict the award, which originally was accepted as a family compact, and that it was not intended that the Muscat State should receive this contribution from Zanzibar, under all circumstances, whether the country be held by an Arab, a Persian, or a Turkish Chief. The question then is as to the point at which the limitation should be fixed. Advert ing to the circumstances out of which the arbitration arose, I cannot avoid the conclusion that it was intended to confer the right of succession to all the benefits of the award upon any of the descendants of Syud Saeed who might be recognized as Sultan of Muscat, but not to extend it to strangers or to members of the family in more remote degrees of consanguinity. In this view of the case I should not be prepared to enforce the payment of the subsidy to Syud Ajan, who, at the date of the last advices which I have received was the de facto Ruler of Muscat. But I am not unmindful of the fact that two of the direct descendants of Syud Saeed, viz., Syud Salim and Syud Toorkhee, are making demonstrations with the object of expelling Syud Ajan, and that another revolution may place one or other of these chiefs at the head of the Government of Muscat. Whilst affairs are in this unsettled state, it would obviously not be expedient to release the Ruler of Zanzibar from the payment of the subsidv, as circumstances might again render him justly liable to the disbursement, and if he should once receive an acquittance he might consider it a greater hardship than before to be called upon to make the payment. But as I understood that by a recent arrange ment the money is now paid through the Bombay Government, it might be held in trust, pending the struggles for supremacy which are imminent, and the Sultan of Zanzibar might be informed that if the succession to the Chiefship of Muscat should pass out of the55 family of his father, the money deposited by him in the interim would be returned to him and he would be released from all further payments. In^ such a case it would, of course, be necessary, to fix some period, at the end of which, if the family of Syud Saeed should not recover possession of Muscat, the subsidy payments should be restored to the Sultan of Zanzibar, but this might be left for future decision. No. 57. Mr. Otway to Mr. Merivale. Sir, Foreign Office, May 29, 1869. I HAVE laid before the Earl of Clarendon your letter of the 10th instant, inclosing the draft of a despatch which the Duke of Argyll proposes to address to the Government of India relative to the subsidy paid by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Sultan of Muscat, and requesting to be favoured with any opinions which his Lordship may have to offer upon the questions to which the draft relates. Lord Clarendon desires me, in reply, to state that he has some difficulty in offering an opinion upon matters on which he has not the same detailed information that is possessed by the Secretary of Sate for India, and on which, therefore, he has not the same oppor tunity of forming a correct judgment. It appears, however, to his Lordship that it would be a more satisfactory solution of the Zanzibar and Muscat question if we were to accept the de facto state of things, and to declare that the arrangement which we brought about in 1861, between the sons of the late imaum of Muscat, having lapsed by reason of the revolution that has recently taken place in that State, Her Majesty's Government no longer feel themselves called upon to compel the Sultan of Zanzibar to continue the payment of the subsidy to Muscat. Lord Clarendon is of opinion that it is open to Her Majesty's Government to adopt this course, and that it would be good policy to do so, and thus to relieve the Indian authorities from an embarrassing engagement. His Lordship does not understand on what ground it is sought by the Indian Government to maintain that the payment of the subsidy by Zanzibar to Muscat is an engagement between State and State, and has no reference to family considerations. If Lord Clarendon is rightly informed, the arrange ment in regard to the subsidy, which was originally made between the two sons of the late Imaum of Muscat, Sultan Majid and Sultan Thouweynee, had respect to the two brothers only, no provision whatever being made for its continuance beyond their own lifetime; and it was only by a decision of the Government of India that it was sought to extend the arrangement as between State and State. But, whatever may have been the considerations which at that time influenced the Indian authorities to extend a personal compact into an engagement between Slate and State, the revolution which has recently taken place in Muscat has entirely altered the state of things, and, in his Lordship's opinion, it would be manifestly unjust to compel Sultan Majid to pay a subsidy to the present Ruler of Muscat, who has no claims whatever upon him, and not only has deprived Sultan Majid's relatives of the Chiefship of Muscat, but has also, if Lord Clarendon is rightly informed, confiscated the private property of some of his relatives which fell into his power. Lord Clarendon is glad to perceive, from the tenor of the proposed draft to the Governor-General of India, that the Duke of Argyll is not prepared to enforce the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy to Syud Azan the present Ruler of Muscat. His Grace, however would appear to be of opinion that, as by a recent arrangement the amount of the subsidy is paid by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Bombay Government, it might be held in trust by that Government during the struggles for supremacy in Muscat which are supposed to be imminent, to be returned to Sultan Majid, should the Chiefship of Muscat pass definitively away from his family. Upon this point. Lord Clarendon desires me to submit, for the consideration of the Duke of Argyll, whether the fact of the subsidy being held in deposit by the Indian authorities for an indefinite period, on the chance of one of the direct descendants oi Sayu Sayed regaining the Chiefship of Muscat, it may not be calculated to act as an inducement to the dispossessed Chiefs to attempt to reconquer the Throne of Muscat, and thus be the means of perpetuating hostilities which it might be better policy to discourage. His Grace will probably be better enabled to arrive at a correct judgment in this matter than Lord Clarendon. His Lordship desires me, however, to state that, as far as Imperial interests are concerned, it would materially assist Her Majesty's Government in making arrangements with the Sultan of Zanzibar for the suppression of the Slave Trade on thePoof Toast of Africa if His Highness were absolved from the payment of this subsidy; and Lord Clarendkm would, therefore, learn with satisfaction that it had been found compatible with Indian interests and engagements to make this concession to Sultan - I am, &amp;c.

C.B., His Excellency s Agent here, has been obliged, from bad health, to leave his post suddenly, and pass on his trust into my hand You are aware that Mr. Churchill's health suefered severely in September last; and that he had in consequence to quit Zanzibar on medical certificate. He was then to proceed to Bombay, it being the cool season there at that time, and not to return African coast until his health should be re-established.57 We were therefore much disappointed to find that, deceived by the improvement he felt when at sea, Mr. Churchill returned to his duties after an absence of only one month, thus exposing himself to the hottest and most trying portion of the year at As had been anticipated by all the medical men who have had the opportunity of observing him, the improvement did not last long. Two months had not passed betore he was again showing signs of a return of the former symptoms, and before three mont s had expired Mr. Churchill was prostrate; and from that time he has not been able to enter into business, or even to pass over the work in a regular manner. , , - Mr. Churchill's removal from Zanzibar is imperative. Another attack such as he has had would surely be the last, and such will undoubtedly return if he remains here. 10 g 0 to Bombay is at present impossible, and, if practicable, it would be unadvisable during the hot season. Aden is equally inaccessible. Our isolated position here will be imagined when I mention that, for four months, we have not received an European mail, and have little prospect of getting our letters for several months to come. Therefore 1 have strongly uro-ed Mr. Churchill to embark for the Cape of Good Hope on board of a fine, commodious steam-vessel, the 'Tynemouth,' which proceeds thither direct. From the Cape Mr. Churchill will proceed to London, and there report himselt to the India Qfg[ ce Nothing but the most urgent necessity could justify such a course as this; but I trust that his Excellency the Governor will see that the necessity did exist, when I assure him that it is to save Mr. Churchill's life that this course has been followed; and I think that rest at home will save to Government an able servant, who has done good service m the East, long before he came to Zanzibar. , j t, ^ ^ I have the honour to forward inclosed copies of documents to be placed betore the medical authorities at home, with which Mr. Churchill goes provided.

Meara, Esq., Commander in Her Majesty's Royal Navy, arrived in this port on the 9th instant, from a cruise off the north-west coast of Madagascar, and the coast of East Africa, between Delgado and Zanzibar. Captain Meara has placed in my hands for adjudication, as Acting Judge in the Vice- Admiralty Court, sixteen dhows which he has taken and destroyed on the grounds that they were engaged in the Slave Trade. As many of these vessels were the property of wealthy natives, I anticipate considerable delay and trouble in the settlement of these cases. Captain Meara tells me that to the south almost every dhow is now under the French flag; that when last year only five dhows with the French flag were seen by the 'Nymphe ' during her cruise, in the same parts this year there are tifty, and that so well do the natives know with what jealousy France protects her rights, that dhow owners told him plainly that he no right to touch them even if they had a cargo of slaves, politely showing their papers at the same time. These papers he found in all cases drawn up regularly. There is no doubt that very soon the French flag will be the only one in use on this coast, giving, as it does, perfect protection alike to the honest trader and the regular slaver. I have, &amp;c.

IN continuation of my despatch of the April, 1869, I have now the honour to report, for the information of his Excellency the Governor in Council, what happened subsequent to the arrival of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe ' at Zanzibar. At about half-past 1 on the morning of the 11th instant, I received private informa tion from Sheikh Suliman bin Ali Wizur to the Sultan, whose name, for obvious reasons, it is particularly desirable should not appear, that the northern Arabs were engaged in embarking slaves at a point within rifle-shot of the Consulate. I at once communicated this to Commander E. S. Meara, of Her Majesty's ship 44 Nymphe,' requesting him to send boats immediately in order to learn the truth, and seize the dhow if found. Before an hour had elapsed two cutters, commanded by Lieutenants Clarke and Hodgson respectively, where alongside a dhow on the spot indicated. She lay within twenty paces of the beach, where were assembled about thirty armed Arabs guarding a crowd of Slaves. On boarding the dhow, she was found to be half full of slaves. The few Arabs then in the vessel jumped overboard and swam on shore, leaving the dhow and slaves in the hands of the boats' crews. The Arabs on shore then fired on our sailors, killing one seamen, and wounding Mr. Hodgson severely in the hand. Under a murderous fire kept up from the beach, the boats' crews, behaving with the greatest coolness and gallantry, succeeded in towing off the prize. When alongside the ship, I examined some of the slaves as to how they had been taken, and by whom, and I also seized thirty private letters, the greater part of which proved to be invoices and advices of shipment of slaves, with prices and charges on them. This consignment was meant for Ras el Had and Jailan, the country of the Beni bii Ali and Beni bu Hassan, subjects to the Sultan of Muscat. Part of the correspondence was of a political nature, which led to the immediate arrest of several influential men in town. I have asked the Sultan to secure all those engaged in this shipment of slaves, as the originators of the outrage, and I feel assured that Seyd Majid will assist me in bringing them to judgment. 'His Highness has replied by placing the dhow and slaves at the disposal of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe,' although taken in his own harbour, and warmly approved of my proceedings, condoling with us on the loss we have sustained. This dhow will accordingly be condemned in the Vice-Admiralty Court as a prize to the officers and crew of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe.' His Highness' Secretary, Sheikh Suliman bin Ali, is now engaged in examining the slaves as to where, and by whom, they had been sold, in order that all concerned may meet with punishment. I trust that His Highness' conduct on this occasion, and the gallantry of the officers and men engaged in this capture, may meet with the approbation of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN KIRK. Inclosure 3 in No. 61. Dr. Kirk to the Sultan of Zanzibar. (After the usual compliments.) Zanzibar, April 11, 1869. IT is my duty to bring to your Highness' notice at the earliest opportunity, what happened last night between certain Arabs under your Highness' jurisdiciion, and two boats' crews of Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe.' Having learned that certain Arabs were embarking slaves at Nasimoja at midnight, I gave information of the fact to the Commander of Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe,' and requested him to send immediately for the purpose of learning the truth of the report. Captain Meara at once sent two boats to the spot. They had no sooner arrived and seen that, indeed, upwards of 100 slaves had been embarked, and that many more remained on shore, under guard of about thirty Arabs, than the Arabs fired upon the English boats from the shore, killing one man, and wounding most seriously one of the officers in command. When attacked, the boats returned the fire on the Arabs and towed off the dhow, containing slaves numbering 135, notwithstanding the firing of the Arabs. 'When first attacked, the boats were only thirty paces from the beach, so that every shot told against them ; and I consider that the crews behaved most gallantly in thus succeeding in taking off the dhow and slaves. I have now to demand of your Highness what I know it will be a true pleasure for you to grant; that is, the seizure of all suspected to have been engaged in this affair, and the punishment of those convicted. The slaves now on board Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe ' will identify the house in which they have been secreted, and which is well known, and the correspondence taken out of the dhow will throw more light still on the authors of this outrage. I have the honour to inclose a list of those who shipped slaves in the dhow, that they may be seized. (Signed) JOHN KIRK. Inclosure 4 in No. 61. Abstract of Correspondence seized on board of the Dhow taken on 12th April, 1869. THE capture of correspondence intended for Arabia, which was made in the dhow taken on the morning of the 12th instant in Zanzibar harbour by Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe,' shows clearly that the people of Jailan and Ras el Hadd, especially the Beni boo Hassan, are deeply implicated in the outrages yearly committed by the Northern Arabs who frequent these parts during the north monsoon for no other purpose but that of the Slave Trade. One third of the letters taken contain lists and prices of slaves shipped in this dhow, and to whom they are consigned. Some refer to shipments that have already taken place. All complain of the present high price of slaves, and one man writes that, in cor.sefjuence of Seyd Majid's vigilance, he cannot safely execute an order for slaves at the j resent time. In general, the letters speak highly of the strength of Seyd Majid's Government,which they seerr to regret. One, however, holding a contrary opinion, informs his frierids in Jailan that ' Majid's fire has 2 :one out.' He prays that Argan bin Kees may long reign to conquer the world, and that soon they may divide the spoil of the enemy. . ' . Treason such as this has met with a speedy punishment, only to be obtained in despotic countries. . The common opinion expressed in all is, that Majid s own wish is to attack Oman, drive out Azan bin Kees, and restore his own family to power ; but no one professes to know when this expedition will take place, nor does any one say that Seyd Majid has ever openly declared his intention of going.

OWING to the absence of Her Majesty's cruizers at the time when the southerly monsbon first set in, many slaves had been taken north, previous to the arrival of Her • Majesty's ship 'Nymphe' at Zanzibar. In consequence of the capture of slaves made on the morning of the 11th instant, which I have had the honour to report, and the strenuous exertions of Seyd Majid, the export of slaves was arrested; but it was known that many hundreds were secreted both in town and country, ready for shipment to Arabia, on the departure of Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe. 5 ' Captain Meara has accordingly sailed, ostensibly for Seychelles, having on board a general mail and passengers; but before proceeding thither, he will return to the African coast, and lay in wait for slave dhows to the north of Pemba. As had been anticipated, on the night subsequent to the ''Nymphe's' departure, when no danger was looked for by the Arabs, slaves were openly embarked ; and 1 have much pleasure in bringing to the knowledge of his Excellency the Governor in Council, that one dhow, containing 50* slaves, was seized in harbour by Seyd Majid's soldiers. This is a step which, I confess, I did not expect His Highness would have taken, in the absence of an English man-of-war, as these Northern Arabs are a turbulent race, ready to resist our own sailors when their slave-trading is meddled with. It will be seen by his Excellency, from what has taken place this season, that the Northern Slave Trade is far from being suppressed, and that the means now adopted are quite insufficient to check it effectually. Every year, Arabs of Oman, subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, come to Zanzibar, with a few dates, cloths, and other trifling articles, which they exchange for slaves. During the three months of their stay in Zanzibar, they are a constant menace to the Sultan, and should Seyd Majid attempt severe measures to stop their slavery, they would set his power openly at defiance. The position of His Highness is, in this respect, one of peculiar embarrassment. Anxious to keep the good opinion of the English at a time when he has much to ask of us, he still hankers after a good name among the people of Oman, whom he looks on, and with justice, as a race superior to their descendants,—the Arabs of Zanzibar. I do not myself believe that His Highness contemplates an expedition to Muscat, for the purpose of re-establishing his family on the Throne; but I have thought proper to make it plainly understood that no such adventure could be tolerated by the Indian Govern ment ; and it is the interest of Zanzibar to have as few relations as possible with Eastern Arabia. As the late outrage on the boats of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe,' in which one seaman was killed, and two officers severely wounded, is clearly proved to have been the work of the Beni boo Hassan, a powerful Omanee tribe, of Ras el Hadd, subjects of Muscat, I would respectfully suggest that the Sultan of Muscat be held responsible for this act of his subjects, and called upon to bring this tribe to punishment by fine or otherwise. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN KIRK. * It has since been ascertained that all these were stolen, not a single one bought. This dhow also belonged to Muscat Arabs.62 No. 64.

Your Lordship will find this subject alluded to in my despatch No. 30 of the 10th of April, addressed to the Secretary to Government of Bombay, of which a copy has been addressed to your Office. . _ I will add that, in consequence of the sudden departure of Her Majesty s ship ' Nymphe,' I was unable to inclose a copy of the letter which Captain Meara proposed addressing to Sir L. Heath on this subject, and which will be accompanied by the deposi tions of the various boarding officers sent for the purpose of verifying the genuineness of the flag, when used in suspicious looking vessels. I will mention that Captain Meara states that where there were five French flags last year, this season he found fifty, and that although he made a rule of boarding them, in no case did he find the ship's papers irregular. He was told, in at least one case, that although there were negroes on board, he had no right to inquire whether they were slaves or free, and he stated to me that if the system of getting the French flag continued much longer, our efforts in the seas between Zanzibar and Madagascar for the suppression of the Slave Trade would be fruitless. Among the European and American merchants in Zanzibar there is now a demand for coasting craft under the French flag. In a native dhow there is always the risk that some one of the crew or passengers may buy a slave, and so compromise the freight which has been placed on board in good faith; and therefore a flag which defies scrutiny has obvious advantages. Mistakes may also occur from a crew composed of negroes being taken for slaves; and there are cases still more difficult, in which the crew are slaves, but working for w T ages, a portion of which goes to the master ; yet these slaves are sufficiently free to go to India and return to Zanzibar. Of the fact that the French flag is rapidly covering the Arab native craft there can be no doubt, and it is greatly to be regretted that it has been found impossible to grant the English flag even to born subjects of British India who may enter into the coasting trade. These men are reduced to flying the red flag of the Arabs for want of a better, and this, in the eyes of our cruizers, is always a most suspicious colour.

IN paragraph 29 of my printed instructions, making provision for the exercise of Consular jurisdiction in Muscat, and received from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, through Her Majesty's Government of Bombay, I find the following command :— ' And it is further ordered that Her Majesty's Consul within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat shall, for and within the said dominions, and for vessels coming within those dominions, and in regard to vessels captured on suspicion of being engaged in the Slave Trade within those dominions, have all such jurisdiction as for the time being ordinarily belongs to Courts of Vice-Admiralty in Her Majesty's possessions abroad.' 2. The order referred to being Consular, the course regular for me to pursue is to apply direct to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for instruc tions, should doubt arise in my mind relative to action that may become necessary consequent upon the existing order. But as weeks must elapse ere I can receive replies from Her Majesty's Secretary of State, and as Her Majesty's steam-ship 'Dryad,' Royal Navy, is engaged at this instant on duties of Slave Trade suppression in Muscat waters, I have deemed it to the interests of Her Majesty's service that I should solicit for my guidance the opinion and instructions of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council on the following subject;— 3.

I HAVE received your despatch of the 30th of April last (No. 247 of 1869) stating, that no Sultan and no Government having yet been recognized at Muscat by Her Majesty's Government, doubts have arisen in your mind as to how far you are justified in adjudi cating in the matter of slaves or suspected slavers seized within dominions appertaining to the Sovereign of Muscat, and you request instructions for your guidance on this subject. I have, in reply, to state to you, that the fact of the present Ruler of Muscat not having been recognized by Her Majesty's Government, in no way affects the policy of Her Majesty's Government towards that State, in regard to the suppression of the Slave Trade ; and you should, therefore, continue to act in carrying out the provisions of the Consular Jurisdiction Act, and in adjudicating in the cases of captured slaves and suspected slavers in the same manner that you would have done if the present Ruler of Muscat had been recognized by Her Majesty's Government. I have further to inform you that the Secretary of State for India concurs in the opinion that your Consular jurisdiction is in no way affected by the existing state of affairs in Muscat, and that the Duke of Argyll has written in this sense to the Governor of Bombay. 1 am, &amp;c.

WITH reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I am directed by the Earl of Clarendon to transmit to you, to be laid before his Grace the Duke of Argyll, the accompanying copy of a despatch which his Lordship has addressed to Lieutenant- Colonel Disbrowe relative to the doubts entertained by that officer in regard to his jurisdiction in matters of Slave Trade in the present state of our relations with the Sultan of Muscat.* I am, &amp;c. (Signed) A. J. OTWAY. [341] No. 71. SDr. Kirk to the Earl of Clarendon.—(Received July 1 .) (No. 19.) My Lord, Zanzibar, May 21, 1868. I HAVE the honour to forward, inclosed, the evidence of the captain and supercargo of a dhow that was destroyed in the Mozambique Channel by Her Majesty's ship ' Petrel,' but of which we have received, as yet, no official information. This evidence was taken before me at the express desire of His Highness the Sultan. I did not think it well to thwart him in this, although I am of opinion that what is here stated only confirms the suspicions on which the officers of Her Majesty's ship ' Petrel' seem to have acted. I have further to inform your Lordship that due notice was given at the time when the crew of this dhow came back to Zanzibar in the steam-ship ' Tynemouth ' that any appeal or statement must be made in time to be sent in the ' Tynemouth ' to the Cape of Good Hope, where, in all probability, this case would be tried before the Vice-Admiralty Court; but that His Highness and those concerned neglected this opportunity, although that vessel remained at Zanzibar for nearly a month. I have warned those interested that by this wilful neglect of the proper steps for their self-defence, they have, in my opinion, forfeited all right to be again heard. I have the honour to point out to your Lordship that what chiefly annoys His Highness and causes him to persist in representing this case to your Lordship, is the fact that none of those men who are now shown by me to have been slaves, were suspected of having been such by Her Majesty's ship ' Petrel,' as all, even including the female slave, were sent back to Zanzibar into slavery, and in charge of the agent of their owner. His Highness asserts, therefore, that it could not be on the ground of having a slave crew, that this dhow was destroyed, but for some other reason to him unknown; and His Highness desires that he may be informed what the grounds were on which the vessel of his subject has been burned, and if condemned in the Vice-Admiralty Court at the Cape, the reason why. As to the Sultan's protest otherwise, I have already expressed my opinion that the present evidence shows this dhow was engaged in a very questionable voyage, and that, had the owners wished, they might have made their statement in time to appear before the Court at the Cape. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN KIRK. No. 74. Dr. Kirk to the Earl of Clarendon.—(Received July 1.) (No. 20.) V y ' My Lord, Zanzibar, May 22, 1869. I HAVE the honour to inclose for your Lordship's perusal, and transmission to the proper authorities, the proceedings in the Vice-Admiralty Court held here on the 14th of April, in the case of Captain E. S. Meara and the officers of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe' versus an Arab dhow, owned by A.li bin Nassur, Governor of Membas, which was destroyed in Kiswara harbour by ship ' Nymphe' on the supposition that she was enffasfed m the illicit Slave Trade. As the decision has in this case been against Her Majesty's ship, and as there will be a claim founded thereon for compensation by those who have lost through the destruction of this dhow, I have given notice to all concerned to lay their claims before me for scrutiny and verification ; but, unfortunately, as is usual in such cases, the people of the dhow have been sent on shore where the vessel was destroyed, and of them only one has as yet come to Zanzibar. The dhow which was burned was of course a total loss, but the goods were all transhipped and sold at Zanzibar to the amount of 2,096 rupees, which, however, does not represent the total value, as there was a heavy loss on many articles. It is impossible for me as yet to estimate the whole of the claims, as the owners have not returned, and part of the cargo, amounting I am told to one-half, was landed at Uuiloa. 1 his it will be my duty minutely to investigate, but in the meantime I transmit the proceedings before the Court on which the case must rest. I. shall briefly repeat, for the information of your Lordship, the chief circumstances attending the capture of this dhow. rto (I 67 u: A Membas Arab, named Ali bin Nasser, was the owner, living at Membas. He sent his dhow to Zanzibar, with authority to his agent either to sell or charter her as seemed most profitable. Not finding a purchaser, she was chartered by a company of Membas Arabs, who sailed in her for Lindi, a port about fifty miles south of Quiloa. These Arabs placed on board a valuable cargo of cloth and powder, part of which seems to have been landed at Quiloa. On passing Kiswara harbour, which is about twenty miles south of Quiloa, they run out of water, having met with contrary winds. On entering the bay they found Her Majesty's ship 'Nymphe' at anchor. Being ordered to go on board they lowered their boat and did so, but as the captain and most of the officers were out in the boats at the time, the captain of the dhow was detained until the following morning, when the dhow was burned after all the goods had been removed. The captain and officers of Her Majesty's ship considered themselves justified in so doing, 1st, because there were on board six slaves, some of whom they say were to be sold on the African coast; 2nd, because she had slave papers on board ; 3rd, because the cargo was for the purchase of slaves. After a very careful examination of the evidence, I am convinced that this dhow was not engaged in the Slave Trade, nor is there any proof that she was intended for it, but on the contrary, that she was a legal trader. The slave lists have been fouud to have no reference to this voyage ; and it was the duty of the ship's interpreter to have pointed this out, as it is plainly written on the face of them that they are of old date, and both of them made out where slaving is allowed by Treaty, along 500 miles of coast. In Court it appeared that this interpreter cannot read either Arabic or Sowaheli; even the Sultan's dhow pass given to the vessel, which he himself had assisted to destroy, he could not translate ; and although he did know that the so-called slave papers were lists of names, he could not tell the date. There being no proof that the cargo was for the purchase of slaves, and it being absurd to think that Zanzibar slaves would be sold at the coast, the only fact remaining was that this dhow had six slaves on board. Now, looked at in the spirit of the Treaties with Zanzibar, this is, in my opinion, a matter of no importance under the circumstances. These six slaves were domestic slaves of the Arab merchants on board ; some had followed their masters on former voyages even as far as Arabia; others had been born in the family, and all had lived for a long time with those they now served. They were now going to a place where slaves could not be sold, and the season had passed for reaching Madagascar. Being taken in one of the Sultan's harbours south of Quiloa, the capture could only be mace under the letter of Seyd Saeed, of the 6th of May, 1850, wherein it is expressed: 'All vessels found in these places (i.e., between Quiloa and Cape Delgado) to whomsoever belonging, if engaged in the Slave Trade, may be seized.' Now, 1 am of opinion that no Arab, on signing such a concession, would for a moment think that the present case was one of slave-trading, nor would the summary destruction of such a dhow be justified, unless she had a full cargo of slaves, or could be clearly brought under the plain meaning of ' slave-dealing.' 1 take this opportunity most respectfully to submit to your Lordship that under existing Treaties, the position of the Commander of one of Her Majesty's ships, or that of Judge in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Zanzibar is one peculiarly embarrassing and unsatisfactory. Our naval officers work well in a difficult and responsible situation. I am not aware that hitherto a single Zanzibar dhow has escaped condemnation; but it is to be remembered that before a Court at a distance, when all those interested have been sent on shore at the nearest point to which the dhow has been taken, a trial is ex parte and the prize must of necessity be condemned. And it is a fact that I have just received from the Bombay Government thirty-six free men, negroes, but sailors, who had been passed to Bombay from Aden, among the sixty slaves taken last year by Her Majesty's ship ' Star ' near Brava. It is very singular indeed that upwards of half the so-called slaves should have to be sent back at Govern ment expense to Zanzibar after the dhows from which they had been freed had been condemned. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN KIRK.Lieutenant -Colonel Disbrowe to the Earl of Clarendon.—{Received July 12.) My Lord, Muscat, May 28, 1869. A SERIES of threats, culminating in open defiance of Seyd Azan, the de facto ruler of Muscat, by his Excellency the Viceroy in Council's commands, relative to the repose of the sea, compelled me, on the 24th instant, to transfer Her Majesty's flag on shore to Her Majesty's gun-boat 44 Clyde,' anchored some 400 yards oft* the forts and town of Muscat. , 2. Her Majesty's flag was again displayed from yesterday at this Consulate tor the several reasons here beneath particularized, and I respectfully trust your Lordship will approve of my proceedings, and admit that in rehoisting Her Majesty's flag, 1 have acted in accordance with the dignity due to Her Majesty's Government, o.

WITH reference to your letter of the 29th of May I am directed by the Duke of Argyll to forward to you herewith, for the consideration of Lord Clarendon, draft of instructions relative to the present aspect of the Muscat-Zanzibar question, and its bearings on our policy in the Persian Gulf, which his Grace proposes to address to the Government of India, in substitution of those inclosed in the India Office letter of the 10th of May, and I am to add that his Grace will be glad to be furnished with the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on this subject, with the least possible delay, as the Govern ment of India are pressing for an answer to their despatches. I am &amp;c. (Signed) J. COSMO MELVILL. Inclosure in No. 76. Draft Despatch to the Governor-General of India. India Office, July , 1869. 4' HER Majesty's Government having taken into deliberate consideration the corre- . spondence noted in the margin, relating to the affairs of Muscat and Zanzibar, especially as affected by the recent revolution at the former place, I now proceed to j communicate to your Excellency their views of the important questions thus brought to their notice. 2. The events of this revolution, resulting as it did in a change of dynasty at Muscat, had involved the affairs of that State in such uncertainty, that, for some time, it seemed probable that each mail would bring to England intelligence of some new political vicissi tude, which would render nugatory any instructions which Her Majesty's Government might communicate to you. But a sufficient period has now elapsed since the expulsion of Syud Salim from Muscat to make it appear to be little probable that he will ever recover the position which he has lost. The general aspect of affairs, indeed, both as represented in these papers and communicated to me by officers recently employed in the Persian Gulf, 1[341] T seems to be favourable to the permanent establishment of the authority of Azan-bin Gh^s. Many of the most influential Chiefs are said to be among his supporters, and the resources neither of Syud Salim nor of Syud Toorkhee are such ss to enable one or the other to subvert the power of the de facto Ruler of Muscat without external assistance. 3. If the anticipations, reasonably based on these statements, are realized, your Excellency's Government, in pursuance of the policy indicated in these papers, will formally recognize Ajfan-bin-Gh^s as Ruler of Muscat, in accordance with the sovereign will of the people. This policy Her Majesty's Government approve. 4. But whilst Her Majesty's Government are thus willing to recognize a Chief acceptable to the people, though not a member of the ruling family with which we have so long had political relations, such recognition is not to be supposed to carry with it any obligations on our part to enforce or to support those external engagements with Persia and Zanzibar, which Syud Thoweynee had formed, and which were inherited by Syud Salim, as his son and recognized successor. 5. With respect to the relations of Muscat with Persia, I have already informed you by telegraph, that in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, Persia has an undoubted right to refuse to Azin-ben-Ghes the continuance of the Bunder Abbas lease. And I can see no reason why the British Government should interfere further in the matter. 6. I have now to advert to the questio ^ of the Zanzibar subsidy, re speclmg-JSLhiA there has been so much correspondence.^Her Majesty's Government have taken the ^subject into their deliberate consideration with reference to the present posture of affairs \ at Muscat, and it appears to them that whatever might have been the obligation on the part of'your Government, to exert your influence to maintain the continued and regular^ payment of the subsidy to the legitimate successors of Syud Saeed, it is not incumbenr| upon them to interfere any longer now that the succession has been interrupted by a ' 'revolution, which has placed the authority in the hands of a member of another family. Your Excellency may, therefore, in form the Sultan of Zanzib ar, that tho hritiph Govern- mp nf are willing to consider the arrangement which was jpaad&amp;.iaJiilil, and communicated to^Bis Highness in Lord Canning's letter of the 2ndof April of that year, to have lapsed on the expulsion of Syud Salim from Muscat, and that it will rest with him (Syud Majid) to enter into such engagements with the new Ruler of Muscat as, in the present altered . circumstances, he may consider to be advisable.jVo ' V* 7. But it will be your Excellency's duty at ffte same time to impress upon the SultanS' of Zanzibar and Muscat, that it is the wish of Her Majesty's Government that peace should prevail between the Rulers of the two divisions of the old principality of Syud Saeed; and that, moreover, it will be incumbent upon you to interfere in the event of any naval operations being undertaken which will cause disturbances in the Persian Gulf. It is the desite of Her Majesty's Government that in the words of the concluding paragraph of your letter of the 10th of May, you should ' allow your present orders to remain in force, which would, in the event of a maritime contest, or a contest, the materials of which were'supplied from the shore, but which broke out actively by sea, necessitate a resort to forcible 'intervention by such naval means, however limited, as are at our disposal.' 8. Your Excellency's Government, however, have brought to my notice that these means'at present are inadequate; and you strongly impress upon Her Majesty's Govern ment the existing want ' of a properly organized. nayal foW, capable of ' remaining on the coast at all seasons, sufficient to preserve order and tranquillity in the Persian seas, and to. prevent the danger with which the properties of .British subjects might, in that unsettled region, at any conjuncture be threatened.' And you especially advert to a remark made by Commodore Sir L. Heath, in a letter to Colonel Disbrowe, to the effect that, at some seasons of the year, service cannot be performed by Her Majesty's ships, manned as they now are, without imminent danger to the health of the crews. With reference to these important considerations, I have to inform your Excellency that I have been for some time past, in communication with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty with a view to the provision of an adequate naval force for service in the Persian Gulf, and in other waters over which your Government exercises supervision, and that I hope shortly to be able to communicate to your Excellency that arrangements have been made to place the maritime police of the gulf on a perfectly satisfactory footing, I am, &amp;c.70 M No. 77. Mr. Otway to Mr. Melvill. Si r&gt; Foreign Office, July 19, 1869. I HAVE laid before the Earl of Clarendon your letter marked Confidential of the 12th instant, inclosing for his Lordship's consideration a draft of instructions relative to the present aspect of the Muscat-Zanzibar question, and its bearings ^an our policy in the Persian Gulf, which the Duke of Argyll proposes to address to the Government of India in substitution of the instructions inclosed in the India Office letter of the 10th of May last; and in reply to his Grace's request to be furnished with Lord Clarendon's views on this subject, I am to state that with reference to the recognition of the present Ruler of Muscat by Her Majesty's Government, and as regards the relations of that state generally with Her Majesty's Government and with the Government of Persia, his Lordship is not in possession of any information which would enable him to speak with authority on these matters, and he would wish, therefore, to defer entirely to the Duke of Argyll's views. But as regards the question of the Zanzibar subsidy, while entirely concurring with the Duke of Argyll in the propriety of releasing Sultan Majid from the payment of the subsidy to Muscat, yet Lord Clarendon would not recommend that this concession should be made without obtaining from His Highness some important concessions on his part limitating the Traffic in Slaves from His Highness' territories, and his Lordship would suggest, therefore, whether it would not be sufficient for the present for the Governor- General of India to inform the Sultan that Her Majesty's Government will not insist on the continued payment of the Muscat subsidy, on the understanding that His Highness consents to enter into negotiations for the more effectual suppression of the Slave Trade from his dominions, and that the terms which Her Majesty's Government would propose will be made known to him shortly. There is one other point upon which Lord Clarendon would be glad to receive some information before expressing any opinion in the matter, namely, the question of the Bunder Abbas' lease. In a Memorial from the British Steam Navigation Company to the Bombay ! Government r'ated the 12th of March, 1869, a copy of which was communicated to this , Department in the Indian Office letter of the 18th of June, his Lordship observes that/ this Company strongly deprecate the surrender of the port of Bunder Abbas to Persia, and anticipate great difficulties in the way of trade from the intrigues and annoyance of the Persian authorities in the event of their resuming possession of the place. It would appear, however, from the 5th paragraph of the proposed Instructions to the Governor-General that the Persian Government has refused to continue the lease of Budder Abbas to Azin ben Ghes, the present Ruler of Muscat, and that his Grace sees no reason why Her Majesty's Government should interfere in the matter. Lord Clarendon would be glad to learn from the India Office, whether, in the opinion of the Indian authorities, the fears expressed by the Company have any well grounded foundation. 2-^ | (Signed) arn ' A.

I AM directed by the Earl of Clarendon to transmit to you the accompanying copies of two despatches, with their inclosures in original, from the Acting British Consul and Political Agent at Zanzibar,* reporting the proceedings which have taken place in the Vice- Admiralty Court in that island in the cases of several dhows captured and destroyed by Her Majesty's cruizers on suspicion of being engaged in the Slave Trade ; and I am to request that, in laying these papers before the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, you will state to their Lordships that Lord Clarendon would be glad to receive any observations which the Legal Adviser of the Treasury upon Slave Trade matters may have to offer upon the cases to which these papers relate. In will be seen that in the case of a vessel belonging to the Governor of Mombas, destroyed by Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe,' judgment has been given in the Vice- * Nos. 73 and 74.I ' 71 \ Admiralty Court against the captors, and Lord Clarendon fears that if the system of destroying vessels suspected of being engaged in the Slave Trade which is now carried out to a very considerable extent by British cruizers on the East Coast of Africa is continued, not only will it give rise to large pecuniary claims on Her Majesty's Government, but in some instances vessels may be destroyed, and their owners, from not knowing where their case will be adjudicated, may be unable to obtain a hearing and defend their property; and thus injustice will be done to honest traders, a state of things which it is on every account the object of Her Majesty's Government to avoid.
