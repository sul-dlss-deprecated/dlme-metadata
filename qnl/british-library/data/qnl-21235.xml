D.O.No: Office of the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Camp,Bahraia,the 8th February 1933 Please refer to your D.O.No:C/30 of 19th January 1933 to Gastrell on the subject of the appointment of Mohanlal Mehta,the previous B.I.Agent at Dibai. I Letter dated 15th December 1933,0 mm Uu of correspondence No:408,from the Residency Agent,0 2. It is quite correct as you say that Mehta was dismissed by the B.I from Dibai,but the grounds of dismissal were not strong enough for the B.I -- so I gather -- to run a case against him,though under the peculiar conditions prevailing on the Trucial Coast proofs to support a case would anyhow have been difficult to produce. The general grounds for Mehta's dismissal were apparently that he had muddled and neglected his work. 3. Gastrell discussed the matter with Battey,Mespers representative at Bushire,who recently toured the Trucial Coast,partly in connection with getting Mehta out of Dibai, which he succeeded in doing. There had been a previous attempt some time ago to remove Mehta but the Shaikh of Dibai,who undoubtedly found him useful,probably in feather ing his nest at the expense of the B.I,managed to cling on to him. enclose herewith copies Sharjah,with enclosures on the subject noted in the margin. ( 4 )C£&gt; V 2 4. We have of course to help B.I interests on the Trucial Coast as elsewhere,first - because they are an important British concern,and second - beceause they really only agreed to call at Sharjah so that we could offer an extra inducement for the Shaikh of that place to agree to an air port being established there. Gastrell discussed the matter of Mehta’s appointment at Sharjah with Battey, who was strongly against it on the general grounds that the Company do not relish handing over valuable cargo to a discharged employee. However,the appointment has been made, and I do not see how we can upset it. If,however,Mehta proves unsatisfactory we can bring pressure on the Shaikh by threatening that the B.I will not call at Sharjah until Mehta has been removed,or until he has amended his ways, whichever seems necessary. 5. I pointed out to Battey that it was unsatisfactory from Mespers point of view that their business with the Trucial Coast should be conducted at long range through Bushire,that it would be better if theirBahrain represent ative was -- subject of course to control from their head quarters at Basrah — put in charge of it. Battey quite agreed and has addressed Russell and his office at Basrah on the subject. In future,therefore,you and Russell between you can deal with any B.I questions that crop up on the Trucial Coast. If necessary,you can always refer to me and Russell to Basrah.
