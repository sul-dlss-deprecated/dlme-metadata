[July IB.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [28322] No. l. Sir Edward Grey to Tewfik Pasha. (Confidential.) Your Highness, Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply of His Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard ro the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question afiecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative [2546 s—l] B2 Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex 3). and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likelv to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working ot the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by3 His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the loth April. 8. His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the con- x tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her^ Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. 1 he original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of lurkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4. Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ol El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan beino- admitted by yf Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military randum post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with (Annex the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their pchcy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “His ; Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise ( f in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, !i buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine p| arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development4 Memo randum ^ (Annex 5). of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. ANNEX 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £ T. 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid by the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed .and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties :— (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (e.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/.) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attacheu is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the' places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to difierent places. 11. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 16. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities.17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of their duties by the officers of the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention be deemed to give the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of any treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. 19. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the day of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. ANNEX 4. Kowe it. HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Badaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Biyadb. Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Biqa’i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, gfra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and ’Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [2546 s—1] D8 conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which w r as not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, wdio carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point wdiere it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. Ihese tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and vdiere possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902. this tribute has been collected through the agencv of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— E That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Peisia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. o. lhat, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this Emit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His. Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were f°t. usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed m Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter ins Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it asO, Karguzars house Telegraph Office Post Office Lynch Brothers Office Haji Pais’s house Wheat Market Consulate Dwelling house Lynch Brothers warehouse Custom’s Office Quarantine Station Guest house (Persian Gois*) Quarantine M.

Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally ^.observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from .the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, v and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point ’etween the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the &lt;am' Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Xazmleh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark ; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “ thalweg ” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession ” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.(ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii.) The modem port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on ^ from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to camp^ia ail ^ land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (yi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.• 1 c) n ~&gt; ly dear Parser, Please see Cox's letter Ko.1499 of 16th Pay ( sent to Foreign Office on 16 J h instant) enclosing a long letter from Khakespear (dated POth April) criticising tlw draft Koweit convention in its then form.

The Shaikh claims to include the Al-Gara’a and Al-Haba wells, and all the information T i, aV6 f( ’ ee r ab ' e t0 c . ollect points to the fact that his claim is justly founded I have attached herewith the confidential “ Map of the Kuwait Hinterland’’' ith the doubtful portion in the south corrected from my latest tours, and would to 'be usefuT^vTr ^1 'r”® map Un&lt; ' or ' ected in ? our office as likely to be usetul. By far the strongest argument in support of the Shaikh’s claim however, is the actual s.tuation of the wells themselves. Takin- the Al-Haba wells as a centre and striking a semi-circle of 90 miles radius from east round by south to west disc oses the fact that in the whole of the intervening country there is not a single well and that the nearest wells to the southward He on this semi-circle, tu*.,-those of Awaina, on the east situate 27 miles sou h of Anta a, next those of Hafar-al-Ats, almost due south from Al-Haba and those of Gaiyiya (at 10a miles), south-west of Al-Haba. It may be taken for ^ranted that nomad Arabs recognise authority in the desert according to welts and a w at k™ 7 . t0Ur f .VT 1 heard i* 1 suggested that the wells of Hafar As-Safa, Al-Gara a, and Al-Haba (all along the Shaikh’s southern boundary) 1D tcrntor - v and jurisdiction. How I came to omit the Al-Haba wells from my previous report, No. 62 C., dated the 12th August 19 a 2 ’ it n ° W “ nderstand - I have marked in blue pencil wlia^ is undoubtedly the actual boundary on the attached corrected map. As I have traversed personally the whole of this district, obtained my information from Bedouin camp,ng actually on the spot, and myself produced what map there H of the tiact, i claim that my opinion is entitled at least to as much weight as tnnwtT “ S ,n° £ the I ul kish Government, which has no real or first?hand knowledge of the area, facts or conditions as they actually exist. TT„-Jht )!? ul&lt; i 1 am f u lly aw 1 are 1 tllat aa agreement with Turkey regarding ^feTence that be it r Ts 0 worth n 7 ri 7 ® om P romise ’ J verlture to submit with aU deterence that it is worth while in our own interests to consider how anv compromise is likely to be regarded by the Ruler of Kuwait and his peopkand its piobable effect on our relations. It must be recollected that the Shaikh has not been informed of the course of the negotiations, nor of the Turkish5 demands, nor of our suggestions or concessions thereto he has left his case in our hands with the expectation that we will at least see his just demands satisfied. Consequently we shall have to bear the odium and any resentment resulting from such disappointment as may follow from the agreement falling -g. short of the Shaikh’s expectations. I have shown in previous reports and above what can fairly be considered Kuwait boundaries, and now propose to state what I feel convinced would be the really genuine objections the Shaikh would advance to the draft agreement on Foreign Office print No. 12978, dated 26th March, if it were communicated to him. 6. Taking the draft agreement by articles seriatim — {a) Article 1 may be passed by as without objection. {b) In Article 2 the objection is that the title of Kaimakam is a very inferior one and connotes that Kuwait territory is merely a “ Qadha . An almost exact parallel would be furnished by calling the Shaikh a Deputy Com missioner or Collector under the Indian Government and his territory a “district”. When it is added that a Turkish Kaimakam’s annual salary amounts to £1;:5 to £270 only, and the position indicated thereby is contrasted with the fact that the Shaikh has hitherto enjoyed almost complete indepen dence, been accorded a salute of 12 guns by British rren-of-war and always been addressed officially as “ Ruler of Kuwait”, the depreciation of his position under the draft agreement may be realized in some measures. Further, though ’ Turkish officials address him as Kaimakam and add the title of Pasha, the Shaikh himself does not acknowledge the style and invariably describes himself as “ Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes”. I venture to think that we should stipulate for Kuwait to be described at least as a “ Sanjak ” . and its ruler as a “ Mutasserif ”, of which the Indian equivalents would be a Division and a Commissioner, fihe question of the continuance of a salute to the Shaikh would also seem to be involved in our recognition of whatever Turkish title or rank may be selected. (&lt;?) Article 3 defines complete autonomy sufficiently clearly. (d) Article 4 permits the appointment of a Turkish Agent, and has the most serious objections. The Shaikh has not dreamt of such a possibility, and, I am sure, would object most strongly to the idea. He could doubtless be 0011 ^ 61 ^ to receive one, but the pressure would have to be applied through, with the consent of, or perhaps even directly by, the British Government. The effect on our relations with and our interests in Kuwait of forcing the representative of an undesired Power upon an unwilling Ruler and people may be easily imagined. There is further to be reckoned with the inevitable and recurrent intrigues which will result from the residence of a Turkish official in Kuwait. My own opinion is that the Turkish Agent, if permitted, ! will either be regarded as a spy by the ruling Shaikh of the time or be utilized by him in intrigues and efforts to play off the Turkish and British Govern ments against each other for his own ends. (e) Articles 5, 6, 7 require to be considered together with the map. In the first place, the division of his territory into two portions, over which he and the Turkish Government will have authority different in degree and kind, will be unintelligible to the Sheikh and will moreover lead to constant friction, for the inner segment defined in Article 5 has no naturally definable boundary and is a paper arrangement which the Shaikh will be unable to maintain in the exercise of his authority throughout the whole of the two portions over which at present it is identical in character. Secondly, the suggested difference will furnish the Bedouin tribes subject to the Shaikh and the Turkish authorities with endless opportunities for petty intrigue and friction, particularly if permission for a Turkish Agent as suggested in Article 4 is accorded. Assurn- | ing the best intentions on the part of the Turkish Government and its officials, intrigue remains as the breath of life to Bedouin, and the suggested division of his territory will undoubtedly hamper the Ruler of Kuwait in his dealings with the tribes. I would suggest that the Shaikh’s complete autonomy as defined in Article 3 should extend to the limits described in Article 7, modified so far as may be considered possible by the information I have given above in para graph 4. The alternative southern boundary given in a starred foot-note to6 Article 7 is uspIpss from tho Shaikh s point of vigw for reasons already given in paragraph 4 above, and moreover is not desired by Mm. In this connection it would seem desirable that the evacuation of the Turkish posts on Bubian Island and Urn Kasr should be ensured either by the present agreement, or, if preferred, separately if that at Safwan is allowed to reuwn. It will be clear from reports ever since the occupation of these posts in 1902 that the Shaikh would have taken measures to eject the Turks but for being restrained by British assurances that we had not lost sight of the matter. The stipulations in Article 6 prohibiting Turkey from stationing garrisons or taking military or naval action within Kuwait boundaries should be maintained. (f) Article 8 requires no comment. I (^) Article 9 requires no comment beyond that I believe the Shaikh has already succeeded in obtaining legal recognition for his landed properties in that permission is said to have been granted for their registration in his own name without the formality of taking out a Turkish “ nafas tazkireh ”. | (A) Article 10 would, I am certain, be most strongly opposed bv the Shaikh for the reasons given in Residency telegram No. 602, dated the* 28th March 1913. If some such clause is strongly pressed for, it might be worded su as to permit the passage of Turkish troops to Nejd by no route nearer to Kuwait than the caravan road passing along the western boundary from Basrah by the Batin depression to Hafar wells. , Tliough the foregoing may he said to be largely destructive criticism of the draft agreement, I have endeavoured to show how that agreement may be made somewhat less unpalatable to the Shaikh. Unpalatable it will be and will remain for years even with the emendations I have suggested, but it seems to me that in treating with the Turkish Government we have hardly given the Shaikh’s irrefutable rights the consideration due to them, for his claim has throughout been founded on a just minimum of existing facts which we have been at some pains to investigate ourselves, whilst in our desire to meet the Porte we have shown a benevolent sympathy to their vague, extravagant and nebulous claims, unsupported as they are by any real evidence, which they do not merit. That we may obtain a quid pro quo elsewhere does not affect Kuwait for the Sheikh will judge the agreement as it touches himself and his people and inasmuch as he has left his whole case unreservedly in our hands he will be the more inclined to resent any serious diminution of his territory, prestige, rights or privileges. The whole force of such resent ment will certainly recoil upon us, more especially were the idea to obtain that we had benefited in some other sphere, and it is because I feel so strongly that the advent of any bitterness in our very cordial relations with the Ruler of Kuwait should be avoided as far as may be possible that I have ventured to submit the above paragraphs for consideration. Shaikh Mubarak has been far more loyal and straightforward in his dealings with us than we could have anticipated from an oriental chief of so little education, and therefore merits the most benevolent consideration of his claims at our hands, more particulary when we are negotiating regarding them practically without consulting him the party most interested. ° * Rough translation of an Article appearing in Arabic newspaper “ Al-Dastur ” t published in Basrah, dated the 12th Jamadi-al-Awal 1331 (16th April 1913).

I am to state that Sir E. Grey is opposed to any communication being made at this stage to Hakki Pasha regarding the objections of the Sheikh of Koweit to a Turkish agent. He is of opinion that the position should be fully explained to the Sheikh; that the many advantages which accrue to him by reason of the draft agreement with Turkey should be judiciously but cogently laid before him; that in particular stress should be laid upon the wide definition of his territory, the settlement of his interests as a private proprietor in Turkey, and ) INDIA j ,r±.l9l3.. the he Under Secretary of State India Office.(25o76/l2) thy fact that Turkey is expressly debarred from Inter ference in the external or internal affairs of Koweit. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that Sir P. Cox should, if necessary, proceed to Koweit to lay these considera tions before the Sheikh, to whose acceptance of the agreement as it stands he attaches the utmost importance. At the same time, I am to add that the Sheikh will not be asked to receive an agent from Turkey until the agreement has actually been signed and ratified. On the acceptance of the agreement by the Sheikh Sir E. Grey considers that it might be wise to confer upon him some fresh decoration. I am.

Following from Cox. “ Owing to precarious state of health of Sheikh of Koweit, as previously reported no intimation of terms of draft convention regarding Koweit had been made to him up to *A)th instant. In view, however, of the forecast of conven tion contained in Reuter’s telegrams of 17th instant which ordinarily go to Koweit, I instructed Political Agent to communicate to Sheikh verbally, as from me, a general idea of what we believed to be the probable terms of the document; impressing on Sheikh when doing so that his general position had been satisfactorily assured and that in order to achieve that result it had no doubt been necessary to adopt a give-and-take attitude in regard to some points of detail, as is necessary in the case of all amicable agreements. Political Agent now ^ ?

He pointed out that his engagements with us which had been faithfully observed had been undertaken expressly as a defence against this contingency. “ Political Agent adds that there are signs that Sheikh thinks that he inay have been sacrificed as regards this item for some quid pro quo and expresses opinion that nothing short of strongest coercion will alter Sheikh’s attitude. The explanation given in Government of India’s telegram of 13th July 1912 does not weigh with him. I earnestly hope it will be possible to get this item eliminated, in the first place, it is really a modification of the status quo ; secondly, as urged, the Sheikh in his capacity of Kaimakam is himself Turkish representative : or perhaps difficulty coidd be got round by his appointing one of his sous especially for dealing with Turkish cases and interests. The present disturbing situation at Basrah and Katif seems to give us an excellent opening to warn [?

Cox telegraphs :— “ As His Majesty’s Government are aware, lands along Khaiyin from Diaiji to Falliyeh are most valuable to Sheikh and necessity for maintaining unimpaired our influence and position with him, seems to make it out of the question for us to let them go to Turks. This being the case, I presume that His Majesty’s Government have only allowed Hakki Pasha’s proviso to stand because consider it merely pro forma, and fully intend that it shall be nothing more. In my judgment it is* essential that in warning Sheikh we should inform him to latter effect, and 1 solicit instructions to do so. According to my information there is a very strong inclination abroad among Arabs of Mesoptamia and Shat-el-Arab to take advantage of Turkey’s present weakness in order to throw off her yoke, and having regard to all powerful influence which Mohammerah and ivoweit wield over them, there can be little doubt what would be result of any ill-advised attempt of the Porte to assail interests oi Mohammerah in way suggested by Hakki Pasha’s proviso. Apart from this, settlement is of course highly satisfactory.” We strongly support Cox’s views, and trust that he may be authorised to inform Sheikh as suggested.—CONFIDENTIAL.

Mr WEDGWOOD asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether every agreement, treaty, and undertaking be tween this country and any other country is now public property; and, if so, whether the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah are included in the term other country, or not ? The SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sir Edward Grey): The answer to the first question is m the negative. The answer to the second is , that the status of Koweit - and Moham- merah is exceptional. Agreements made with them were not contemplated as coming under the head of treaties ma e between His Majesty’s Government and other Foreign Governments to which the previous statements made in the House applied. Mr. SWIFT MacNEILL: Do I under- -stand the right hon. Gentleman to say that there are other secret treaties besides the secret treaty recently disclosed between this country 7 and France? Sir E.

M ith reference to the final paragraph of your letter I am to observe that, since it is not proposed to communicate to the Turkish Government a complete set of our agreements with Koweit, the previous understanding suggested in that paragraph seems more than we have a right to demand. ^ 3.- Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs. I am to enclose copies of these V-AnK — Treaties extracted en bloc from Aitchison’s “ Treaties, Engagements, and Sanads,’ and to say that Lord Crewe sees no reason why they should not be communicated if Sir E.

But it seems expedient to remind the Porte that British rights in the Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, but on the custom, consent, and Jong established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R. Ritchie. Foreign Office. Enclosure Xo. 3. India Office to Foreign Office. (Immediate.) India Office, ^ r &gt; _ 30th October 1911. With reference to this Office letter of the 11th September regarding the communication to the Turkish Government of our treaties with Koweit and other states in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that on a further consideration oi the terms in which the Government of India proposed to define our obligations towards the Sheikh of Koweit he finds himself no longer able to concur in them. The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit b}- land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Xor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 8th April last, the term “ good offices ” (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of 23rd Janurry 1899 we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a con veniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will moreover have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. His Lordship would, therefore, suggest that the formula should run “As regards Xo. 1 His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to “ their obligations under the Agreement His Majesty’s Government “ undertake to support them and accord them their good offices.” With perhaps the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to them selves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. 1 have, Ac., The Under Secretary of State, R.

I recognise as valid and in force all former treaties and conventions agreed to between the chiefs of Bahrein and the British Government, either direct or through the mediation of its representatives in this Gulf &lt;- Article 2.

With regard to Meade-s letter of same date.l think that only Ist paragraph should in any case be communicated and would urge that if possible even that should be avoided seeing that it only provides for 'good offices', whereas in December 1901 and October 190£ Sheikh was infonaed that'we will not tolerate attack by Turkish troops or ships on Koweit and that we will Protect Koweit and districts against attack.' I sugge8t that lt would suffice merely to append note to copy of 1899 agreement that we had informed sheikh that as long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under it 'we g d ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit and district against attack by land or sea.' As regards lease of foreshore, October 15th 1907,I respect fully question necessity or advisability of communicating its wouj.d not find a place in any compendium of treaties.

I suggest we tell lurks if asked,or even spontaneous ly, that we had a lease of land at Koweit but see no necessity to discuss details. As regards views of the Sheikh I know he has no objection to disclose the agreement of 1899 so long as he feels absolutely assured we mean to stand by it. i expect his attitude will be the same in regard to the foreshore lease, but I agree that he should be consulted. *o ship is available till Wednesday but unless instructed to the contrary, I will proceed to Koweit then.

We have consulted Cox who has personally interviewed Sheikh of Koweit. Latter, in absence of more definite knowledge of present negotiations, is opposed to disclosure of details regarding agreement of f 1907, i.e., foreshore lease, firstly because places are referred to by name in regard to which he has rejected overtures from other quarters, secondly because it contains provisions which were framed as a safeguard against possible contingencies which may never arise, thirdly because publication of details would in any case cause inconvenient gossip amongst his own subjects and would also greatly increase hostility of Turks to him in the event of Anglo-Turkish negotiations proving abortive. I think it would be very undesirable to furnish Porte with any part of text of agreement. They are already aware of its existence, vide Ixiwther’s despatch to Foreign Office, No. 396, dated 28th May 1909, and it would perhaps suffice to inform Porte spontaneously that we have a lease of land at Koweit, but see no necessity to discuss details. Sheikh welcomes publication of agreement of 1899, always provided that we do not intend to diverge from it. On the same understanding I think agreement might be communicated to Porte, but I deprecate furnishing any part of Meade’s letter of 23rd January 1899. Disclosure of 2nd paragraph is obviously undesirable, while paragraph 1 (? only) provides for “good offices,’’ whereas in December 1901 and October 1902 (Vide Secretary of State’s^telegrams to Government of India, dated 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902) Sheikh was informed that we would not tolerate attack by Turkish troops or ships on Koweit, and that we would protect Koweit and district against attack. I suggest that it would suffice to append a note to copy of 1899 agreement that we had subsequently informed Sheikh that as long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea. You will presumably furnish Skeikh’s agreement to prohibit import or export of arms, vide our Secret Despatch Ntf 86, dated 5th July 1900, and his undertaking not to allow establishment of Post Office by.any other Government than British, vide your telegram of 19th February 1904 and enclosure to Secret Despatch No. 152 (External), dated 27th flctober 1910. * As regards Bahrein and trucial coast, we have no treaties other than those in Aitchison, which is a published work, and this being so, all or any might be communicated to Porte. Exclusion of 32nd and 46th might be misunder stood. Except for this, I see no objection to their exclusion. from Secretary of State to \ iceroy, Ff/reign Department,, 1 1th 4 uqna t 1911.

[28300] No. 1, Memorandum communicated to the Turkish Ambassador, July 29, 1911. (Confidential.) HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to give their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last from the Ottoman Government. These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that thev cannot be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (in.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) Ihe Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty’s Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enterprise ; am, while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that^in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister oi Finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an arrangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, of the w iole in regard to the Gnilf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution, and, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests in other sections of the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage of British shipping are borne in mind. Since ^ the arrangement laid before Djavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, they have received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman Government with some surprise. Ihe Turkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole, and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. The details of the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties interested. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis, His Majesty’s Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other Power including Tin key, and, in ord er to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should be 20q)er cent. Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty’s Government consider that a Convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned providing for the exclusion of differential ra‘tes on any railways in Asiatic Turkey, and for equality of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cognate matters; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed ; for the introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the develop ment of traffic ; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession.

But if such an airangement 1^00^ they mist stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian l.ulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied m a convention dealing with these matters. (ii.) The respective Interests of (treat Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf. nard^blT/ct,’ 8 ^'iment are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding paia raphs of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may be reached as I’erVau 1 p Sp , e f ct, '’ e po . s * tlon of the tvvo countries, commercially and politically, in the I eisian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions iiivo veil should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are in no sense opposed u-hiVl?tb S1 H mJte claims of tbe Turkish Government. The most southerly point to Oiefr inTbl‘ a H :e i eV f SU o Ch ? Iairns 011 the littoral of t!l c Persian Gulf is J , the district of El Katit. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish Afflf' ever a' g been ^paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign IWm lT U e ;' e&lt; t t V lIer Maj . esty s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime nr the iuH e . nte t r iU l 1 an y intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, dLe h ib^ d P f- d *r nbe f °v the r 0ast0f *6 Persian Gulf ; and it is only since that 1 e tll ‘ lt certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south of Ojeir. . i le ,Pp? sltl ° n °^ 7 11 1 ls Majesty’s Government in regard to these tribes has lieen entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since 1805; these leJations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties dating from 1820 and JiaMiig as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade ; the regularitv of the successor to the throne ; the protection of the island against foreign aggression- and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat anc ic emtoiies of the 1 racial Chiefs His Majesty’s Government have, in virtue o \auous treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years: and len po icy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of all countries and of protecting the long-established interests of British-Indian subjects. His Majesty s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement which ini&lt;&gt;ht res net or undermine the authority which they have exercised uninterruptedly \\1 1 suci beneficent results; they conceive that any extension of Turkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty; and t ie\ have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between 1G ^ ? T&gt; 0 i Ver - S must for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Govern- meni of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula of El Katr (me udmg El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; and they (onsn ei that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source of local friction. I he Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty’s Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence oi opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there a modus mvendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty’s Government conseAt- mg to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained fromthere ’ they wouid iiot — centJrifstd tl'lntt?- ‘l' 6 S1 ! eikllS ° £ Ko '' eit esisted awards of two onui V of its ru e aZ thp V t place f has aUr f ,:t r i “‘erchants from all quarters by the ZseL to anv intelrpnpp r^ f ,tS ,rad . e - His Majesty’s Government could not o^anv infrinoenifmt ' f success1011 or , '' ith the internal administration, tU J latuI1 ge n ent ot the complete autonomy of the Sheikh.

This commission would superintend a matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical survevs. As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Govern ment, so iar as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (al to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters- and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. K (iii ) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. His Majesty s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs dutif-s unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railwav question. ^ .r . Mtitude they adhere; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave in a state of uncertainty a number of questions closelv afiecimg British interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. rp ls Majesty s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction in turkey ; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Railwav ii it is to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an area where nitisli rights and interests have, especially of late, been wantonly assailed; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade,—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 per cent, of the whole^-unless they have provided for a general settlement of political issues in the eisian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bring about, and unless they have obtained some compensation for and a guarantee against the’con tinuance of aibitraiy acts such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext of British property in Bagdad. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt,—a measure which is called for in the interests of financial reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their first aim to con tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the twof I cm crs , and they will not only consent, subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the V i ' o Clis l° ms ^ or a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy ot the o per cent customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914.

Yousuf Pasha did more than he was asked 1 to Pie suggested that Sheikh Mubarek should repair the old embankment and plant it, therebv ceding all that had ever been m dispute. He sent a yuzbashi down to see that no one m erfered with the execution of the work, which was carried out, according to Sheikh Mubarek, unknown to the civil authorities of either Fao or Bussorah. Sheikh Mubarek explained to me that the predecessor of Yousuf Pasha, Tahir Pasha, was not actively, hostde to Mubarek s execution of the work, and even assisted the sheikh by letters addressed to the Yah of Bussorah. It will, however, be remembered that His Majesty’s acting consul, Mr. Geary, at my visit to Bussorah in July last, came to a very different conclusion regarding the attitude of the military commandant towards the embankments in question.m.—From Secretary of State to Viceroy, XUh October 1902.

Ibn Ilaschid is stated by Mubarak to have with him a gun presented by Turks; according to Bahrein reports, he has five guns. The answer to Mubarak should, I presume, be that his request cannot be granted, but that Mis Majesty's Government undertake to defend Koweit district provided that he complies with injunction conveyed to him in accordance with your telegram of Uh December 1901 —see Lord Lansdowne's Memorandum of 2\st March 1902.

There can he no reason for fresh assertion of Sultan’s rights, or for attempt to further define them, which, if not superfluous, must clearly involve alteration. The action of the Nakib appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise, and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit.

I We tlw bDnour to invite a reference to the correspondence on the subject of the enquiry by the Sheikh of Bahrein into the matter of the confisca tion at Bahrein of the arms and ammunition belonging to Messrs. Pracis Times. Mr. Pracis, a representative of the firm, is now at Bahrein, awaitino' this enquiry, but it is evident from recent reports addressed to me by Mr Gaskin, the Assistant to the Resident at Bahrein, that the Chief has no mten- tion of holding any enquiry as to whether the concession granted by him for the importation of arms into Bahrein had been infringed. He now withdraws this contention, and maintains that the arms were seized at the instance of ft S tteI, M ^ llam i! na&lt;i R m hltn ’ Wh j° 1S V ’J 0 'T dead ’ and has &gt; he says, no representative at Bahrein who could proceed with the case, and he wishes to restore the arms to Messrs. P racis Times. He has informed Air. Pracis, through the Assistant Resident, that he is at liberty to leave Bahrein whenever he may wish to do so It, however, appears from Mr Gaskin’s latest report, dated 22nd instant, that Mr Fracis has now requested the Chief of Bahrein to hold an enquiry regarding ue alleged theft of arms from the godown of the firm prior to the seizure, and that the Chief has consented to do so. a • 3 * * W f Ul n so i lcit the orders of the Government of India regarding the advisability of allowing the Chief of Bahrein to restore the arms to Messrs Qi ra Mi T i r ^ eS ; Ma J0 st y’ s Government having adopted the view that the Sheikh of Bahrein as a Sovereign Ruler so far as his internal administration is concerned was authorised to seize the arms, I do not see how he can be prevented from restoring them should he wish to do so. It does not seem to me to he clear what was the real motive which the Chief had when he ordered the sequestration of the arms, and at any rate, as a Sovereign Chief, he had iust as much right to seize the arms at the request of a merchant trading at Bahrein, as because the terms of the concession, which he had granted wpp« alleged to have been broken. &gt; c, u It will be seen that Colonel Meade, in the concluding paragraph of his memorandum on the subject, forwarded with his letter No. 69° dated 21st November 1898 to your address^ made the suggestion that the arms should be delivered over to the firm on pertain conditions, and so far as I can see there is no objection to this course being taken. On grounds of public policy, it would seem that we have the right to insist that the Chief, if he surrenders the arms should see that they are taken out of his territory and similarlv, the coast of I ersia being closed to the trade in arms, we have the right to insist that the tL^G surrendered 1:0 M essi ’ s * Eracis Times, should be taken by them out of2 i • t\ ^l 10 luesticn ' s a complicated one, but, as I understand it the nohVv Tction oT thTrl 011 ^ 8 ^ GoTCrnmer ' t accepts no responsibility for the action of tlie Chief of Bahrein m seizing these arms. The Chief had the arms seized of his own initiative, and he has now to decide as to their disposal although, m the event of the Chief deciding to restore the arms to \Ipssrs’ Fracis limes, the Government of India would claim to have an interest in this question of their ultimate disposal. Should Messrs. Pracis Times subsequentlv make an appeal to this Residency on account of any alleged in-jury done to them by the action o the Chief, they can state their case? which wfll then he enquired into and decided on its merits. 11 e ° e Enclosure No. 3.

Kemball, Officiating: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions, I visited Koweit on the 24th instant, and at an interview with Sheikh Muharek, Chief of Koweit, I explained to him the desirability of his putting a stop to the traffic in arms within his territories. The Chief informed me that up to the present the importation of arms into Koweit had not been carried on to any great extent, and that he had already taken steps to prevent the con tinuance of the trade, as he himself saw the advisability of putting a stop to it in his own interests. He readily agreed to sign an agreement, prohibiting the importation and exportation of arms so far as Koweit territory is concerned. Copies of this agreement and of the notifications signed by the Chief have been forwarded to you under separate cover. 2. Whether the arms trade in Koweit is in reality more extensive than the Chief gave me to understand I was not able to ascertain. It is possible that the Chief himself does not know the extent to which it is being carried on, though, when I suggested to him this possibility, he refused to entertain it. So far as I was able to judge, the Chief intends to abide loyally by his agree ment, and in any case the agreement cannot but have a good effect, as the dealers in arms at Maskat and elsewhere will now know that the trade is pro hibited so far as Koweit is concerned, and that it will, if pursued, be attended with risk. 3 . I thought it advisable to obtain the Chief’s consent to the issue of the proclamation, authorising British and Persian vessels of war to search vessels carrying British, Persian or Koweit flags in Koweit territorial waters. In this connection, however, it has to be considered that Koweit vessels fly the Turkish flag, and although I presume that there would be no objection to British or Persian vessels of war searching vessels under the Turkish flag in Indian and Persian waters, the search of vessels carrying the Turkish flag within Jioweit waters by our ships might prove a source of embarrassment if it cameto the knowledge of the Turkish authorities. I have, therefore, taken no steps to make this proclamation known, and I shall he glad to know the views of the Government of India on this point. ^ I have, however, informed the Political Agent, Maskat, that the Chief of Koweit has prohibited the import of arms into Koweit territory. . 4- During my interview with the Chief, he evinced a most friendly attitude and piofessed his desire to serve the British Government in any way he could. He informed me that all was quiet in Koweit and the neighbouring country, and he appeared to have no cause for anxiety with regard to his own affairs. Enclosure No. 9. No. 166, dated Bushire, the 16th June 1900. From— Captain C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. Ill, dated 29th April last, I have the honour to report that the Chief of Bahrein has now restored to Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co. the arms which he seized in Bahrein, belonging to that firm. Mr. Gaskin has informed me that Mr. Fracis has given the Chief a document by which he holds the Chief free of all responsibility in connection with the seizure, and he has forwarded to me the receipt given by Mr. Fracis to the Chief for the arms. I forward this document for your information. It is interesting in so far as it shows the line of action which the firm intends to take which is in all probability to bring an action against the British Government for damages, on the ground that the arms were seized by the Chief in accord ance with the orders of this Residency. This matter has been fully disposed of in Colonel Meade’s report, forwarded with his letter No. 69, dated 21st November 1893, to your address. 2. It would appear from the language in which the receipt for the arms is couched that Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co. hope to substantiate their claim against the British Government, on the ground that the Chief refused to restore the arms to them without an order from this Residency, and they apparently deduce from this an admission on our part that the seizure was made by the Chief acting under our orders. My letter to the firm, to which a reference is made in the receipt, is forwarded herewith for your information. It wall be seen that this letter by no means admits any responsibility for the seizure, but is merely a reply to a letter from the firm, copy of which is also forwarded, in which they informed me that the Chief refused to deliver up the arms without my permission. Mr. Gaskin further informs me that Mr. Fracis is endeavour ing to dispose of the arms locally to traders who will endeavour to smuggle them across to Persia. The Chief made it a condition of their restoration that they should not be sold in Bahrein, Katr, or the Arab Coast. Received from Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali-al-Khalifah, the Chief of Bahrein, the undernoted arms and ammunition, all in more or less rusty and damaged con dition, restored to us by him, by order of Major C. A. Kemball, the Officiating Political Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, conveyed in his letter No. 464 of 1900, dated 19th ultimo, addressed to us, which was demanded by the Chief of Bahrein in his letters, dated the 15th Zilkada 1317=17th March last, and 27th Zilkada 13l7=29th March last, addressed, respectively, to the Acting British Residency Agent, Hajee Abbas-bin-Fuzzul, and to the Political Assistant to the Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf,6 m Bahrein, Mr. J.

We have the honour to forward, for the information and orders of Her Majesty’s Government, copies of the papers noted in the enclosed list, regarding an agreement which has been concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit, whereby he has undertaken to prohibit absolutely the importation and exportation of arms into and from Koweit territory. 2 . In order to explain the immediate cause of our action in concluding this agreement, we may refer to the correspondence ending with Your Lord^ ship’s telegram, dated the 11th October 1899, regarding the seizure of certain arms and ammunition, the property of Messrs. Eracis, Times &amp; Co., by the Sheikh of Bahrein. We recently learnt from our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Sheikh of Bahrein desired to restore to Messrs. Eracis, Times &amp; Co. their property, which had been confiscated by his orders. Acting on the views indicated by Your Lordship in the telegram above quoted and in previous correspondence, we did not question the authority of the Sheikh to dispose of these arms and ammunition at his discretion, though we instructed our Political Resident to advise the Sheikh that the restoration of the goods to Messrs.

My Lord, We have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, copies of the papers cited in the annexed schedule on the subject of the proposed opening of a Post Office at Koweit. 2 . The question was first considered by Lord Curzon’s Government in • Encioanre.itoi. 1902 &gt; a ' d ^ was decided* to let tile matter he over until a regular steamer service had been opened with Koweit. It was again raised in Lord Curzon’s telegram, dated the 16th January 1904, to tlie address of Your Lordship’s prede cessor, when it was proposed to appoint a Native medical subordinate to hold charge of a Post Office and also to do medical work. In reply, His Majesty’s Government, in a telegram dated the 19th February 1904, approved the proposal, and considered that the Sheikh should undertake 'not to allow the establish ment of Post Offices of other countries in Koweit. Such an undertaking was obtainedf from the Sheikh, and steps were t Enclosure 5. taken to depute an Assistant Surgeon and a postal peon to Koweit. Subsequently, in a telegram dated the 1st July 1904, His Majesty’s Government pointed out that Sir N. O’Conor, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, while he did not question the advantage of the new postal arrangement, considered that its execution should be delayed until the Porte had replied to his representations regarding the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the island of Bubiyan. Mr. Brodrick accordingly directed that the despatch of the postal establishment to Koweit should he deferred in order to avoid any appearance of an infringement of the status quo, while negotiations regarding Bubiyan were in progress. About this time, a British : dated th. wth Ocohe. 1904 . Political Agent was appointed at Koweit, and His Majesty’s Government, agreed} to an Assistant Surgeon accompanying him to Koweit, but only in his profes sional capacity, as His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constaminople did not consider the time had come for the opening of a Post Office. The Political Resident was § Enclosure e instructed§ accordingly, and the Assistant Surgeon was allowed to take a postal peon with him, so that the Post Office might be opened as soon as it was authorised by His Majesty’s Government. The question was again revived|| in 190S by the First Assistant Resident, „ „ , _ in charge of the current duties of ihe 11 E “ olo,u ' e 7 ‘ _ Persian Gulf Residency, but, as we understood that Your Lordship was not prepared to consider tne scheme for a2 Enclosure 8. enMe communication with Koweit, referred to in our Secret despatch, No. 116 (External), dated tlie 13th July 1907, h was consequently considered undesir able at. the moment to re-open the Post Office question. 3. Colonel Cox now submits a further representation* from the Political Assent at Koweit in favour of the establishment of a regular Post Olfice. The Political A ‘.rent urges that postal work has been steadily growing, and that Ids office has become praciieally a Post Office and is recognised as such in Koweit. Colonel Cox considers the project in any case of sufficient importance poli ically to make it worth our while to proceed with it. 4. We understand that the representations which have, from time to time, Vide our Secret despatch No. 116 (External), dated been addressed to the Pofte by His ti.e nth July 1907 . Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, regarding the maintenance of a Turkish military post on tlie island of Bubiyan, have not been successful. Further, His Majesty’s Government recently decided not to raise the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights to Bubiyan, which + vide letter from sir n. O’Conor to the the British Ambassador had put forwardt Warq .ifu.f L.insdowne, No. 372 (Confidential), dated in 1904, but which tlie Porte Contested, the itith M,.y i9o4. therefore, that there is no longer the same need as in 1904 to refrain from putting forward the proposal regarding the establishment of a Post Office at Koweit, especially in view of the previously expressed wish of the Sheikh, the commercial convenience w hich it would afford to the public as evidenced by the increasing amount of postal w r ork, and the possible establishment in the future of a wireless tele graphic installation at Koweit. We accordingly trust that His Majesty’s Government will agree to the establishment of a regular Post Office. The Director-General of the Post Office of India sees no objection to the proposal from a postal point of viewq though he is unable to approve the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Colonel Cox’s letter No. 1628, dated the 19th June 1910, that international notice of the opening of the Post Office should be deferred until the improved arrangements have been working for some time. 5. In the event of the proposal being approved by His Majesty’s Gov ernment, w* presume, with reference to Your Lordship’s telegram dated the 3rd June 1910, that expendituie incurred in connection wdtb the establish ment of the Post Office will be divisible between the Home and Indian Gov ernments, and we propose to submit a further report on the subject on receipt of Your Lordship’s reply.

I have the honour to report that His Brhannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah has forwarded to me, for disposal, a letter received by Mr. Lyle, Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company at Basrah, from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, asking that the postal service may be extended to Koweit. Apart from the question whether the local receipts would be sufficient to cover the expenses of a post office at Koweit, 1 am doubtful if the measure would be considered advisable in view of the position of His Majesty’s Govern ment with regard to Kovveit. At present I understand that the British India Steam Navigation Company have decided to maintain a fortnightly service between Bombay and Kovveit, but it appears to be uncertain whether they intend to do so permanently. Under the circumstances, I propose to reply to Sheikh Mubarak that the present time is not opportune for the consideration of the question of the establishment of a post office at Koweit ; but, before I do so, I think it advis able to ascertain the views of the Government of India on the subject. Enclosure No. 2. No. 156-E.-A., dated Fort William, the 20th January 1902 From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 22 3, dated the 27th November 1901. regarding the wish of Sheikh Mubarak that a post office may be opened at Koweit. 2 . The Government of India would not he unwilling to extend the postal service to Koweit. The difficulty at present is to find a proper locus standi for a post office at that port. The post offices hitherto maintained by the Indian Government in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia are not separate offices. They depend upon the Political or Consular authorities, and the Postmasters, even if paid entirely by the Postal Department, are usually borne on the Political or Consular establishments. If a Native Agent were appointed to Kovveit, it would be simple to give him an extra allowance for conducting the business of the post office, for which there will be a stronger case when Koweit is, once a fortnight, made a regular port of call by the British India steamers on their downward journey. But it is considered that the Native AgentshouJd come first and the post office afterwards. 3 . I am to ask you to consider this suggestion and to favour the Govern ment of India with your opinion upon it It is considered that it would be useful, and probably agreeable, to the oheikh that we should have a Native Agent at Koweit, and I am to enquire whether, if such appointment were made, a suitable man can be found for it, and what, in your judgment, would be a reasonable rate of pay to give him.2 Enclosure No 3. No. 43, dated Bushire, the 1st March 1902 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Residont in the ^ Persian Gulf, ^ To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 156-E. A * dated 20th January, on the subject of the establishment of a British post office at Koweit. 2 The suggested appointment of a Native Agent at Koweit has, in my opinion, much to recommend it, and I could, I believe, find a suitable man for the post. It will be advisable, if the post is created, that the Agent should not be allowed to indulge in trade, and a salary of Rs. 200 a month should, I think, he paid to him exclusive of the allowance for conducting the work of the post office when it is opened. Before, however, the matter of appointing an Agent at Koweit is definitely decided, I think it as well to submit the following points for the consideration of the Government of India. 3. In accordance with the Agreement entered into with the Chief of Koweit in January 1899, the reception by him of an Agent or representative of a Foreign Power cannot be permitted without the consent of the British Govern ment. It is, therefore, a matter for the consideration of the Government of India whether the appointment by us of a regular Agent might not at the present time be found to be inconvenient. So long as we have no Agent at Koweit, we can object to the presence ot the Agont of any other Power at the place as being a breach of the status quo, which we have declared our intention to maintain ; but if you appoint an Agent and at the same time refuse to admit the Agents of other Potvers, might it not be said that we ourselves were disturb ing the status quo ? It is probable that this point has not escaped the notice of the Government of India, and is not considered to be valid objection to the appointment of an Agent by us. 4. Further, it has to he considered that the fortnightly service of the British Inrlia Steam Navigation Company to Koweit has not yet been instituted. Owing to the disturbed state of the Nejd and Shammar country and the imme diate environs of Kuweit, the trade of the port of Koweit is not of sufficient importance to justify the company in maintaining a regular service with the place. In any case, therefore, it may be advisable to defer the appointment of the Agent until the present crisis is over and a regular steamer service instituted. It seems to me, therefore, that, in consideration of all the circum stances, it will be advisable to keep the question in abeyance for the present. I have not thought it advisable to ascertain the views of Sheikh Mubarak on the subject. It is probable, as the Government of India say, that the appoint ment of a Native Agent would be agreeable to him. He would perhaps look on it as a further step towards the Protectorate which he desires. Enclosure No. 4. No. 677-E.-A., dated Simla, the 5th April 1902.

Dane, Esq., I.O.S., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. In continuation of my telegram, dated the 29th Eebruary 1904, I have the honour to report that I proceeded to K owe it where I arrived on the 28th Eebruary. I informed Sheikh Mubarak that the Government of India was willing to establish a past office at Koweit in accordance with the desire expressed by him, and I asked him if he was willing to give the undertaking of the nature referred to in your telegram, dated the 21st idem. The Sheikh made no objection and gave me the required undertaking, which I have the honour to submit in original, with its translation. I trust it will be found to be satisfactory. 2. The Sheikh further informed me that he would arrange for a house to he placed at the Postmaster’s disposal and that this house would be in a suitable position near his own residence. He said that rent w r ould have to be paid for the house and that the rent would be about Rs. 12 per mensem. 3 . I presume that the man selected for the appointment of Postmaster at Koweit will be a Mahomedan having a knowledge of Arabic. He should, I think, before he takes up his duties, receive some instruction regarding them from the Postal Department. The work is not likely to be heavy, but some sort of postal training will be necessary. He will have to take with him from India such olhce furniture as he may require. The Postal Department will of course supply him with everything that is required for a newly-opened office. In my letter No. 105, dated the 5th June 1903, I pointed out that some alteration in the Time Table of the mail steamer service will be required when the post office is opened at Koweit. This is a matter which must be dealt with depart mentally. 4 . I did not consider it necessary to say anything to the Sbeikh about the intention to appoint a medical officer to do the work of the post office at Koweit. Translated purport of an undertake given by Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, As the British Government has agreed in accordance with my desire and for the benefit of traders to establish a post office at Koweit, I on mypart agree not to allow the establishment here of a post office by any other my successors. * “ Write tllis “^ertakiug ou behalf of myself and Seal of Sheikh Mubarak el Salah.

I trust therefore that the Government of India will now feel able to give the proposal their favourable and lively consideration. No. 346, dated Koweit, the 30th May 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W.H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Lieutenant-Colonel F. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit for reconsideration the subject of the establish ment of a regular Post office at Koweit. 2 . My predecessor advocated the opening of a properly equipped office in his letter No. 135 , dated the 25 th March 1908 , and his proposal had the support of the Residency, but Government were then not prepared to proceed with the matter. 3 . To obtain some idea of the extent of postal work at present carried out in my office I caused the records to be scrutinized and mails to be counted. From the results obtained the attached memorandum of the annual postal work has been compiled, in order that a definite basis may be available for estimating cost and expenditure. 4 . The Postmaster-General will be able to form a better estimate than I can of the probable revenue from the figures in the attached memorandum, but I would observe that hitherto the most valuable sources, viz., registration, of letters and parcels, sale of postage-labels, and booking of money-orders have yielded practically nothing, and it is the want of these very facilities that is most felt by the public. The population of the port is estimated at anything between 30,000 and 50 , 000 , and it has large dealings with Indian, Bahrein and other Persian Gulf Ports ; it would seem certain, therefore, that the postal revenue would not be below that of Bandar Abbas or Bahrein. 5 . I am not able to form an estimate of the establishment in the event of an office being opened but submit the following considerations as likely to influence an estimate:— {a) A room for a Post office can be made available in the Agency itself in a convenient position for the public and consequently there would be no charge for rent. Office furniture has already been suppliedcomplete for a branch Post office, forms, seals, etc., and is all available on the spot {vide letter No. 1575 -E.A., dated the 13 th May 1904 , from the Under Secretary, Foreign Department, Gov ernment of India, to the Chief Secretary, Government of Bengal, forwarded under your endorsement No. 1573 , dated the 26 th December 1904 ). {b) The Postmaster would have to find lodging in the town outside the Agency premises for there is no spare accommodation at present and none could be made available without acquiring more ground. (c) There is at present a mail peon attached to the Agency whose salary (amounting to Rs. 20 per mensem) is met from the Agency Budget. This peon could be retained as he knows the work and his salary would be charged to the Postal Department. (d) The mails are taken to and from steamers at present by my Head clerk in the Agency boat. There would be no objection to this procedure being continued with the substitution of the Postmaster for the Agency clerk. Or, if preferred, arrangements could be made for the transport of the mails in the B. I. S. N. Company’s Agent’s boat as is done at other ports. The above gives all the details which I can at present foresee as likely to affect an estimate of revenue and expenditure. 6 . I will turn to former objections to the office which I understand to have been political and raised by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. The present system has been in force since the inception of this Agency and the work has grown year by year until my office has become, in addition to its legitimate rd/e,' practically (with the exceptions noted above in paragraph 4 ) a Post office and is regarded as such in Koweit. The Sheikh would not, I feel convinced, have any objection to the establishment of a regular Post office, even if it is considered necessary that he should be consulted in the matter, a course which in my opinion is quite unnecessary and one which would only invite opposition in a hope that some more tangible benefit might be extracted from Government. Some opposition may be expected from the Turkish Government when the opening of a Branch Post office at Koweit is notified under International Postal Rules, but, in the circumstances, it does not appear possible for it to be serious nor indeed difficult to meet. In Basrah it is well-known that the postal arrangements of Koweit are in our hands and I imagine it is generally presumed that a regular Post office already exists. The Wali himself is aware of it, judging by a conver sation with him which Sheikh Mubarak reported to me some time ago, and in view of the existence of British Indian Post offices in Baghdad and Basrah to gether with our exceptional commercial and political position in Koweit, he would have some considerable difficulty in finding any solid argument against our Post office. If I may venture to hazard a suggestion for bringing about the desired object with as little ostentation as possible it would be that Government request the Postmaster General to detail a Sub-Postmaster for Koweit; on arrival he should take over my Head clerk’s postal duties, his presence being explained to the Sheikh by me as the result of the increase in postal work and consequently Government’s decision to put it on a proper footing. Having assumed his charge, the Postmaster-General could then issue the necessary notification dec laring a Branch Post office open in Koweit. The Post office will thus be a u fait accompli” before any objections can be raised, to combat which we have the cogent arguments outlined above. Memorandum of postal work at Koweii Political Agency. The following figures have been arrived at from a scrutiny of the records for the first four mouths of 1910 . A count was also taken for 5 consecutive mails of the number of letters despatched in the Agency bags.Rs. (a) Value of money-orders despatched from Koweit, via the Bushire Post office 4&gt;35o per annum. (5) Value of money-orders received for delivery and pa ment in Koweit ... 150 per annum. 13 * (r) Value of stamps sold in 1909 ... Value of stamps sold in 5 months of 1910 ... 101 (d) Number of parcels received for delivery ... (e) Number of registered articles received for delivery (f) Number of letters despatched from Koweit 7,310 per annum. 470 per annum. 740 per annum. To explain these figures further it may be added that the value of ( 0 ) money-orders despatched represents only the value of value-payable articles recovered and such money-orders as members of the establishment wish to send. Money-orders from the public are not accepted. The same remark applies to (b) for Koweit not having been notified as a Post office money-orders are not accep ted in India or elsewhere for the port. (^) The value of stamps sold is considerably below the actual number of stamps used on correspondence despatched from Koweit as numbers of the people at present obtain their supply of postage labels from friends in Bushire or India and the figures given represent little more than the consumption of the Agency Establishment. No parcels for despatch nor articles for registration are accepted and con sequently nothing can appear under these heads though from the figures for receipts of these two items for delivery an idea can be formed that there would be a considerable amount of such postal business. The number of letters despatched (/) does not nearly represent the total correspondence leaving Koweit for a considerable number of letters are carried personally by passengers for posting on board or elsewhere to obtain the benefit of a lower rate and also frequently for want of stamps. The number of letters received I have not been able to have counted, but it is certainly not far short of double the outgoing number. Requests are constantly being made for the registration of letters, parcels, booking of money-orders, etc., by the general public but have to be refused, and the want of these postal facilities is severely felt. The sale of stamps also is another item which would yield a considerable sum if a Post office existed. The above details are given in order that an approximate estimate of revenue may be possible.

In continuation of recent; secret telegraphic correspondence about Koweit, I have the honour to submit a report on the present position of affairs there, for the mlonnation and orders of the Government of India. 2 On the receipt of your secret telegram of the 19th of January 1899 I arranged to leave Bushire in the Royal Indian Marine Steamer “ Lawrence ” and, after visiting Kharaj Island on the 20th, I arrived at Koweit on the mornmg of the 21st. I found a Turkish corvette, the “ Zobaf,” in the harbour but decided not to alter my plans on that account; and sent Lieutenant- Commander Kendall of the “Lawrence,” with Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Extra Assistant Resident, who knows Arabic, to call on Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Subah, and tell him that I had come and would like to make his acquaintance. 3. The Sheikh expressed his pleasure at my arrival: but begged me to excuse his coming off to call, as, if he did, he would afterwards be obliged to visit Turkish men-of-war, which would expose him to considerable risks. I was prepared for this, and told Mr. Gaskin to inform Mubarak that I would not press him to come on board the “ Lawrencebut hoped he would send a confi dential i^piesentative from himself to see me, as I had certain communications to make. 4. Accordingly, on the following morning, one of the Sheikh’s brothers, who have sided with him, Sheikh Hamud-bin-Subah, came off and had a private interview with me, during which I informed him that Sheikh Muba- rik’s request to be brought within the sphere of British influence had come to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government, who. were prepared to have a secret understanding with him on certain conditions. The terms of the proposed agreement were then carefully explained to Sheikh Hamud, who said that his brother would be glad to comply with the wdshes of Government; but, at the same time, he referred to the fact that the family own considerable pro perty in Turkish territory, and he expressed a hope that the British Government would promise to help them in regard to those estates, which they may lose if they offend the Turks. I told him that I was not authorised to guarantee any particular possessions, and wmuld have to refer his request for orders. He then begged me to try and see Sheikh Mubarak himself, and discuss the question direct with him. Sheikh Hamud said he would inform his brother what the British Government require, and he then returned to Koweit. Mr. Gaskin soon after followed, and had another interview with Mubarak. 5. ^ I should here mention that enquiries I had made, immediately on my arrival, led me to think that there is no reason for anticipating an imme diate attack being made on Sheikh Mubarak, whose position was further described as more assured than it had previously been. I considered, therefore, that I ought to endeavour to carry out the instructions I had received, and conclude the agreement with him as soon as I could. 6 . The Turkish corvette left Koweit for Eao on the afternoon of the 22nd, and, as Mr. Gaskin on his return reported that Sheikh Mubarak was anxious to see me, I decided to land the following morning. 7. Mr. Gaskin reported that, although Mubarak was anxious to enter into an agreement with the British Government, he would not do so unless I gave him a written assurance that he would receive our support afterwards, and he also informed me that the Sheikh would probably be glad to receive Rs. 15,000, equivalent to about £1,000, in return for an engagement not to cede, sell, lease, &amp;c., any^ portion of his territory. I had directed Mr. Gaskin to* sound the Sheikh on this point. 8 . I met Sheikh Mubarak on the 23rd of January, and showed him the agreement which I had previously prepared. Three copies of it, duly signed 1by the Sheikh and myself, accompany this letter, to he ratified, if approved, hy His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and it will be seen that, in addition to the clause providing against cession, sale, lease, mort gage, &amp;c., of his territory, the Sheikh has bound himself not to receive represent atives from other Powers. This condition appeared to me very desirable, as Mubarak had told Mr. Gaskin that he had received overtures from the Erench, and I trust that it will be approved by the Government of India. 9. At our interview Sheikh Mubarak, while expressing his great satisfac tion at the prospect of an understanding between himself and the British, for whom he declared that he has the utmost regard, said that, before he signed an agreement, which might get him into trouble with the Turkish authorities, I ought to give him in writing a declaration of the intentions of t ne British Govern ment towards himself. He asked for a definite promise of protection and assist ance,^ especially in regard to the property belonging to his family situated in Turkish territory, and he declared that this assurance should form part of the document which he was asked to sign. I informed him that the draft agreement I had prepared was similar to those executed by other Chiefs, and that I was not empowered to enter on it stipulations binding the British Government. Subse quently, in view of the importance of the early conclusion of the negotiation with the Sheikh, I agreed to give him a letter, a translation of which accom panies, and I told him that my instructions did not admit of my promising any thing more than is in it. As he still pressed for a guarantee being given that the British Government would guard the family property in Turkish territory, I informed him that I must leave Koweit, and ask for fresh instructions if he did not see his way to sign the agreement as it stood, and accept the general assurance of our good offices contained in my letter. 10. The Sheikh then, without further discussion, decided to sign the agreement, and did so. I followed his example, and my signature was duly attested by Captain Hore, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon, and Mr. Gaskin, who had accompanied me. After he had signed the Sheikh said he would like to call in his brother, Sheikh Hamud, show him the agreement, and get him to attest his signature. He evidently expected that his brother would do this without raising any difficulties : but when the agreement and my letter were read over and explained, Shaikh Hamud refused to sign the former document, and declared that it was necessary that the British Government should engage to protect the family in their Turkish property before he would be a party to an engagement which might bring them into conflict with the Turks. A discussion, which lasted the rest of the day, failed to alter this resolve, and the Sheikh’s other brother, Sheikh Jabir-bin-Subah, took the same line, and refused to put his name on the agreement. 11. It was not possible to carry out such an important negotiation without the knowledge of the Sheikh’s brothers, who had known all along of his overtures to us, and, as they are co-sharers in the family property, it was desirable to have their assent. As this, however, could not be obtained, Sheikh Mubarak’s signature was eventually attested by Agha Muhammad Rahim, our agent at Bahrein, who is his personal friend, and whom I had taken with me to facilitate the negotiation with him. 12. The agreement concluded with Sheikh Mubarak should be binding on him and future Sheikhs of Koweit, and he assured me that the concurrence of his brothers is not necessary to make it so. It should facilitate the declara tion of an open Protectorate later on, if Her Majesty’s Government decide to declare it, for it is, as far as I can ascertain, the first and only engagement ever executed between a Sheikh of Koweit and the Government of any country. It ought, therefore, to stand in the way of attempts by other Powers, or their subjects, to obtain a foothold in this important place. 13. While, however, a decided advantage has been obtained by the con clusion of this agreement, it must be borne in mind that the fact that the Koweit family possess considerable estates in Turkish territory complicates relations 2I'lVfTu T h °, S ;i eikh ’ S br0thers stated that - according to Turkish law aliens cannot hold landed property in Turkey, and they fear that, if they pals under the protection of the British Government the Turks will nnt fliic io^ * I' 1 ';,' “r °! * l * wiU (’™ They hesitate, therefore, to commit themselves to a course which may result in serious loss to themselves, unless they are assured of protection in regard to rh q estates. I told them that the family would receive our good offices and that I myself thought these good offices would extend to all property he’long- conrse ‘wtTh T&gt; w ^ 1 C0, ' ,d n0t ?iye an y s P ecific assurance^ to “he the jurisdictioifof^another^State. re ^ ard to lmmOTeable FW situated within ¥' Sheikh Mubarak himself appeared to understand this, and to realize the advantage which will result to the Arab rulers of Koweit from havino- an undei standing with the British Government. As long, therefore, as the agree ment is kept secret, no difficulty is likely to arise; but the Turkish authorities am ae°d ^ w ^ ° f my vkit ^ Koweit &gt; and ,heir suspicions being aroused, they may decide to support the other claimants to the Sheikhship and try to dispossess Mubarak of his property near Pao. I am informed that he has made alliances with various tribes in the interior of Arabia, and he considers himsell quite secure as regards his position in the town of Koweit which can moreover, be defended, by gun-boats, from the harbour. There is not therefore much danger of an effective attack being made on the place , W1 U, however, require instructions as to the course to he taken if tne lurks confi&gt;cate the date gardens, &amp;c., in the Busrah district. 15. These estates were formerly a part of Koweit itself, and have gra dually been absorbed by the Turks, whose activity in these parts has greitly increased of late years. If we assume a Protectorate over Koweit Her Majesty’s Government may be able to arrange that the Sheikh’s rights in these properties are guaranteed to him. If this is not feasible, some other course of diplomatic action will be necessary to ensure that the family are not deprived of their revenues. 16. In view of this, I think I might be authorised to tell Sheikh Mubarak and his brothers that their interests in regard to their Turkish estates will be looked altei, and receive the consideration of Her JVlajesty’s Government. It seems to me desirable that we should do this, as it will effectually prevent his brothers from turning against Sheikh Mubarak, and, perhaps, divulging the secret agreement he has entered into. I do not think that they are likely to do so, at any rate at present; but it will be as well to guard against the possibility and to ensure their silence. J 3 7. I have not been able to ascertain the exact value of the property held by the Koweit family on the Turkish side of the Shat-ul-Arab : but I hear that it brings in about £ 6,000 a year. The revenue is chiefly collected during the date harvest until which it is improbable that any interference will be attempted. Translation of Arabic Bond, Praise be to God alone (lit. in the name of God Almighty) (“ Bissim Illah Ta’alah Shanuho”). The object of writing this lawful and honourable bond is that it is hereby covenanted and agreed between Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm John Meade, I.S.C., Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Besident, on behalf of the British Government on the one part* and Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Sheikh Subah, Sheikh of Koweit, on the other part, that the said Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Sheikh Subah of his own free will and desire does hereby pledge and bind himself, his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Bepresentative of any'll ill Power or Government at Koweit, or at any other place within the limits of his territory, without the previous sanction of the British Government; and ne further binds himself, his heirs and successors not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the pre vious consent of Her Majesty’s Government for these purposes. This en«-a»e- ment also to extend to any portion of the territory of the said Sheikh Mubarak, which may now be in the possession of the subjects of any other Government. * In token of the conclusion of this lawful and honourable bond, Lieute nant-Colonel Malcolm John Meade, I.S.C., Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, and Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Sheikh Subah, the tormer on behalf of the British Government and the latter on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors do each, in the presence of witnesses, affix their signa- tures on this, the tenth day of Bamazan 1316, corresponding with the twentv- third day of January 1899.

A most important condition of the execution of this agreement is that it is to be kept absolutely secret, and not divulged or made public in any way without the previous consent of the British Government.

From— Major P. J. Melvill, OflSciating Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, T° The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to inform you that I have received, through Her Majesty s Consul at Busrah a copy of your telegram to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, m which I am directed to submit a report on a proposal that (jovernment should declare a protectorate over Koweit. . ^^ ere can, I think, be no doubt that a protectorate would be of immense advantage to us, but I fear that this could not be done without difficulty. I am aware that Her Majesty’s Government has never acknow- ledgetfl Koweit to be under Turkish protection, but I am convinced that the xorte would claim that it is so, and would resist any attempt on our part to protect the Sheikh. Indeed, if the Turks were to hear positively that the Sheikh was about to place himself under our protection, it is my belief that they would promptly remove him by force. This they could easily do for I am informed that Koweit is unprotected on the land side, and the Turks could bring a large body of troops against it in a comparatively short time. In this connection, I may mention that there are persistent rumours that the garrison of Busrah is about to be increased, and it seems probable that these rumours are not without foundation, for the status of the Busrah command has been recently raised, a Commander-in-Chief having been posted there. 3. Although Her Majesty’s Government has never acknowledged Koweit to be under Turkish protection, the Turks would, perhaps, have reason to protest against another Power declaring a protectorate over the place. So long ago as 1856, though their allegiance was stated to be merely nominal and though, apparently, they paid no tribute, the inhabitants of Koweit acknowledged the * Bombay GoTemment Records, No. xxiv, New sovereignty of the Ottoman Porte, and Beries, Persian Gulf, 1856, paf re 2 y 6 . used the Turkish flag* and the state of t Gazetteer of Arabia, page 44. • , °; l . anairs was very much the same m 1887.t Recently the Turks have taken a considerable amount of interest in the affairs of Koweit, and it is said that the rumoured increase in the Busrah garrison is not unconnected with a suspicion that we wish to take Koweit under our protection. I am informed, too (though I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the information), that the present Sheikh now pass tribute to the Turks. ^ J 4. As you are aware, the present Sheikh of Koweit, Mubarak, murdered his elder brother, Muhammad Pasha, in May 1896, and took possession of the Sheikhship. Mubarak immediately approached the Porte with a view to being recognised, and the heirs of Muhammad Pasha also appealed to the Turks. It would, therefore, appear that the people of Koweit themselves acknowledge Turkish sovereignty, though that sovereignty may be of a somewhat shadowy character. I enclose copies of memoranda on this subject by the dragoman of the Busrah Consulate and by Her Majesty’s Consul, dated the 19th October 1896 and the 12th July 1897, respectively. MEMORANDUM. Sheikh Mubarak who in May last killed his two brothers, Muhammad Sheikh of Koweit. PaS, ’ a and Jerrah &gt; ° f KoWeit - at night, when they were in their harems, is com municating with the Sublime Porte assuring the Sultan that his late brothers were killed by the Bedouins when he was away from the town, and that he (Mubarak) was one of His Imperial Majesty’s loyal subjects. He therefore requested that he be appointed Sheikh of Koweit in the place of his brother.2 Sheikh Saud and Sheikh Subah, sons of the murdered Sheikh Muhammad Pasha, with two younger brothers have complained and appealed to the Sultan, stating that their father’s murderer was their uncle Mubarak. They also claimed that their landed and other properties, which have been seized by Mubarak, may be restored to them as per title deeds they possess. They furthermore prayed that their uncle may be punished according to the law, • adding that, if their prayer was refused, they would do what they thought just. They have engaged two lawyers (from Baghdad and here) who have succeeded in obtaining an order from the Kazi’s Court to sequester the present year’s date crops of their father’s gardens, and the Court appointed Haji Muhammad Chelebi Abdul Vahid, a Member of the Administrative Council, to be the Receiver. Haji Muhammad, with an official and followers, went to Fao in a launch, taking with him the necessary instructions from the Wali to the Mudir of Fao. The latter, however, took part of Sheikh Mubarak and prevented Muhammad Chelebi from taking any action in the matter. He afterwards sent private information to Mubarak through Sheikh Jabir (brother of Mubarak), whereupon Mubarak despatched to Fao 500 armed men to fight and prevent Muhammad Chelebi from sequestering the dates which was given to the “ Sarkars ” (Contractors ?) by Mubarak. On Muhammad Chelebi’s return to Busrah, several complaints were submit ted to the Sublime Porte, who enquired from His Excellency the Wali in the matter.^ His Excellency supported the late Pasha’s sons. His Excellency also pointed out to the Porte certain benefits that would accrue from support being given to the sons, and tried to introduce the Porte to establish formal departments at Koweit and to appoint a Mutasarif and station a battalion of infantry. He undertook to arrange this matter without difficulty by assisting the late Pasha’s sons. It is reported that Sheikh Mubarak has sent thousands of Liras to some officials at Constantinople and Baghdad to support him in his endeavours to obtain from the Sublime Porte the recognition of his appointment. But the Pasha’s sons are trying to punish him as the murderer of their father. The l$th October 1896. (Sd.) M. Mark. MEMORANDUM. Sheikh Saud, second son of the late Sheikh of Koweit (Muhammad Pasha), who was murdered by Sheikh Mubarak last year, paid me a visit on the 10th July, Saturday, at 3-30 p.m. Lieutenant Commander Mowbray of H.M.S. “ Pigeon ” was present at the interview. The elder brother, Sheikh Subah, was unwell and unable to visit me as he had originally intended. Saud is an intelligent looking youth about 20 years of age, but has the appearance of being rather a weak character. After the usual compliments I invited him to say anything he had to say, whereupon he told me that his father had been murdered by Sheikh Mubarak, adding that he and his brother Subah escaped by flying to the desert and claiming the protection of some Bedouin Sheikh (he did not mention his name), who had his brother and himself safely escorted to Dora, the residence of their uncle Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim Sheikh of that place. Mubarak seized everything they had, including some date gardens near Fao. The sons of the murdered Sheikh appealed to the Sultan for redress, and requested that the usurper, Mubarak, might be turned out, and that they might be restored to their position and property.r In the meanwhile Muharak had written to the Sultan asking that he mi'-ht be confirmed as Sheikh, declaring that he had not murdered his brother, and in order to obtain influential support, he proceeded to wholesale bribery, bribino amongst others the Mushir at Baghdad, to whom he gave several thousand iras. The Puikish Government sequestered the property at Fao, but Mubarak sent up armed men to Fao and took the date crops by force. ' * Sand then came on to beg that the British Government would give the brothers their support declaring that his brother would unreservedly pllce him- sell under British protection and would do everything the British Government wished him to do He also begged me to use my good offices to induce Jamal Maimeni, a British Indian merchant here, to rent the date garden at Fao, his idea being that, if Jamal Ma.meni rented the garden, it would be incumbent on t e British Government to see that his property was not interfered with in any way. .J. r epl . 1 ? d , that 1 7 0uId inform my superior authorities what send kh S d ^ Said 40 me ’ and W0Ul11 m£ ° rm Um of au y repiy they might 1 f ’ he , ikh Saud where his uncle Tusuf-hin-Ibrahim was, and he replied that he had no accurate information where he was, but he admitted that his uncle had made the recent attack on Koweit, and that he had with him seven buggalows and about 700 armed men.

In answer to the supplementary question, I should say hat the relations of His Majesty’s Gov- ernment and their position with regard to the Sheikh of Koweit, have now, and on previous occasions, formed the subject of communication with the Government of Turkey, but the fact that negotiations are still in progress, is a reason why it is very aimcult to promise when papers can actually be laid. ^ KINLOCH-COOKE: Can the right hon.
