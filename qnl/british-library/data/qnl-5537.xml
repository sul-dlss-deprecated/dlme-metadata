Again, the Medical Officer lias recently had to imp 9 rt from India spare parts costing about fe.285/- which, in normal times, would not have cost more than .Rs.70/-* The prices of ^ tyres and tubes have increased proportionately. It is therefore indisputable that the Medical Officer is put to considerable loss in maintaining in ■* running order a motor car which is essential for the efficient discharge of his duties. A case for an increase in the Conveyance allowance should have been made long ag 9 , but was not dene as it was erroneously believed that the increase in cost of labour and material was only of a temporary nature. With the Kuwait Oil Company opening up their activities, conditions are not likely to improve, and may deteriorate still further. 3. There is no question of the Medical Officer not maintaining a driver-cleaner as his car must remain attendedat piers where he has to leave it while he visits ships in Kuwait bay during the course of his duty. 4. I accordingly recommed strongly that his conveyance allowance be increased to at least to. 150/- per mensem with efiect from tne 1st January, 1946* The issue of the above has been authorised* ' / r 'i Copy of Telegram N9*28-B/Camp/46, dated 20-2-1946, from Foreign, Simla to Britain, Bushire* Your Express Letter No* 65-52/5, January 7th* 2* Please telegraph average monthly mileage covered by Medical Officer, Kuwait lor which no mileage allowance is drawn* ' 0 1 Copy of Telegram No.A/1039, dated the 14th August 1946, from Britain,Bushire to Foreign, Simla* Your telegram 28-S/Camp/46 dated February 20th.

The Political Agent, Kuwait, hagjrecoramended that the Medical Officer, Kuwait, may be granted a conveyance allowance of Rs.30/- per mensem on the following grounds (1) The Medical Officer is required to perform daily journeys between the Agency and the Charitable Dispensary - a distance of li miles. (2) The Medical Officer, in the capacity of quarantine Medical Officer, is required to perform frequent journeys between the Agency and the office of the shipping agents--»distance of 2 miles. (3) The Medical Officer is therefore obliged to maintain a motor car to enable him to perform his duties as Medical Officer-in-Charge of the Charitable Dispensary and as Quarantine Officer, but as the distances in each case are within a radius of 5 miles from his headquarters, he is not entitled to any daily allowance under the rules. 2. Under Supplementary Rule 89 the Political Resident is competent to sanction the drawal of the actual cost of hiring a conveyance in respect of the journeys in question, but as local conditions render it more convenient, in the public interest, for the Medical Officer to maintain a car, the grant of a fixed monthly conveyance allowance appears to be more appropriate.3* In the circumstances, I support the Political Agent's recommendation, and request that the G-overnment of India will be pleased to sanction, under Supplementary Rule 25, a conveyance allowance of Rs.30/- per mensem to the Medical Officer, Kuwait, with effect from the 1st March, 1938. 4. The expenditure during the ensuing year, amounting to Rs.360/- will be met, as far as possible, from anticipat ed savings in the budget appropriations of this Residency.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3667</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3667</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/91 'Kuwait: conveyance allowance to medical officer'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-25T10:24:07</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 7; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the proposal to grant a conveyance allowance to the Medical Officer at Kuwait.The file is composed of correspondence between the Government of India and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Social security</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
