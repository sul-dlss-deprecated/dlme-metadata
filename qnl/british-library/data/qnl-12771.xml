It explains that this action was not only unauthorised, but contrary to British foreign policy in respect to the Persian Gulf, and makes intolerable concessions to Persia. It especially notes the concession of Kishm [Qeshm] and Bahrain as potentially injurious to British relations with various powers in the Persian Gulf.It therefore declares that the Governor of Bombay has disavowed the treaty, and removed William Bruce from his position as Resident at Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023694717.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
