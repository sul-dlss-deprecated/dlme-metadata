The correspondence is mainly between the Consul and Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, reporting about the necessity of hiring a geological expert to survey the area of Sur and its neighbourhood, and to examine the coal seams there. British Officials considered the coal found in Oman as a convenient source of supply for their Muscat and Persian Gulf requirements. British officials also reported about the French activities and their interest in the area of Sur.While the Sultan of Muscat was in agreement with the British over their interest in the coal export, the Hanawi tribal confederation in Oman was against any British work in Sur. The correspondence includes reports on Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi writing to his followers in Sur endeavouring to stir them up against the British and the Sultan’s building operations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Coal</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00024f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00024f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00024f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
