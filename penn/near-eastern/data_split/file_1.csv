A votary before Nannar. Inscribed ""Samas il Aa. c.1800 bc. Vase, libation, monkey, winged dragon, etc. 26 x 15 mm<br />UE X: a bare-headed worshipper is introduced to a seated diety holding a very small conical object. The seal is inscribed to Samas and Aa. If this is the solar deity, he is apparently beardless, with short hair and a turban tied about his head. A lock or a loose fillet descends past his ear onto his chest. He is draped in a flounced robe. There is a squatting monkey at his knees and behind him a small nude servant holding a buckled shaft or club. His throne is built like a triple-recessed gate.  The assistant leads the worshipper with one hand, and holds in the other a crescent on a short staff. He wears a flounced robe like the god, but there is on his head a distinct pair of round horns and again the curious line descending on the chest. The worshipper wears short hair and beard (?) and a pleated robe. Before him are placed the ampulla and libra, particularly well designed. Below the inscription, nude hunters, club in hand, attack a winged dragon rampant. Here again a small line connects head and chest.

Harper, 1889",,"CBS Register: seal cylinder, lapis lazuli.<br />PBS XIV: two registers of the contests of Gilgamesh and Eabani, and probably a Sumerian king with wild beasts. This cylinder is closely and deply engraved with a mulititude of figures, some of them very unusual. <br />The upper register has four groups. A nude Gilgamesh in front face, with wild locks and beard stands between two lions crossed with two bulls. the same in profile fights with a rampant bull. A very extraordinary heraldi composition is formed of a lion headed man triumphant over two reversed animals, a lion and a deer. he holds them up by the tail, one of which terminates in a small lion's head. The last group shows a thoroughly archaic human figure, with a bird like head in profile, a fillet or a low turban, and a short fringed garment or Sumerian skirt, who holds up by the hind leg a reversed ibex. The cuneiform character: lugal, at the back of his head, proves him to be a king. On a marble cylinder seal from Tello, the same royal figure, with a latticed cap, long hair and beard, and a short loin cloth embroidered on the side , is reprsented fighting a lion. This will explain the presence in the scenes of contest of Gilgamesh with wild animals, of a purely human figure, with turban and loin cloth or a flounced skirt like the old Sumerian ruler Ur-Nina of Lagash. <br />The lower register has six groups, two of which show the same extraordinary composition as above. The lion headed man triumphant over two reversed lions, holds them by the tails, which this time terminate in two ibex heads. In the second group, the lion's head is changed into a head of Gilgamesh with wild locks and beard, while the reversed lions seem to melt into Gilgamesh's body. One of the tails terminates in a small lion's head. between those two heraldic groups, the bullman Eabani, spear in hand, attacks a lion that he has seized by the tail. The three last groups are a rampant lion crossed with an ibex; Gilgamesh holding a lion by the hind leg; the same nude hero, with head in profile, one hand lifted, ready to strike a lion rushing on him.

He is fighting at close quarters, and is perhaps a new version of Gilgamesh and the wild animals, Marduk  and Ashur with the dragon , or the kinds of Assyria as hero hunters. The massive lion and the kneeling hero nearly oppressed by the weight of the brute, form an effective group with great sculptural power. The style is Assyrian. The Aramaic inscription on the pedestal is not earlier than BC 700, contemporary with the beginning of the Persian influence in Babylonia. The hero has Aryan features, straight nose and forehead, pointed beard, hair in three rows of curls on the shoulders. His pointed cap probably made of lambskin, is decorated with tongue or leaf pattern like the lions’ mane. His short tunic reaches to the knees, and leaves the arms bare. A heavy fringe plays above the knees and round the arms. Two dagger sheaths are passed through the double coil of a belt with scalloped edges. One blade is still in its sheath. He has drawn the other to kill the lion. Head, mane and muscles of the lion have the conventional style of the Assyrian sculptures. molded relief.

It was probably originally placed against the door of the Mekal temple, that is, one of the two doors of the inner sanctuary, one of which leads to the courtyard and the other to the outer room at the northeast of the inner sanctuary. The panel is sculptured in high relief and contains two registers; it is about 3 feet high. <br />UPPER REGISTER: this depicts a lion fighting with a dog. On the shoulder of the lion is a tuft of hair, somewhat resembling a star; a star is usually the indication of a superior being. THe lion shows Mitannian and perhaps Assyro-Babylonian influences. The Lion on our panel evidently represents Nergal, the god of plague and death. As the panel must have been set in the door of the temple, the dog thus guarded the entrance against the lion who brought death and destruction. <br />LOWER REGISTER: this depicts the majestic lion of Nergal being attacked by a  dog who is biting his back. THe lion has the star-like tuft of hair on his shoulder and is growling in rage. <br />Summing up the significance of the scenes sculptured on the panel, it may be said that the upper register shows the lion trying to enter the temple and the lower register the same animal being driven away from it. It will be notices that the tail of the lion in the former instance is in the air, and in the latter instance between his legs.",,,,,,,,,,,28-11-366,http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/454375,https://upmaa-pennmuseum.netdna-ssl.com/collections/images/image_not_available_300.jpg
