The papers primarily consist of British intelligence reports on the exchanges of these senior American figures, and their lower ranking colleagues with their counterparts in Afghanistan. Some papers detail these discussions with regards to the potential for oil concessions and arms deals. Finally, a few papers discuss Russian intentions in central Asia and possible Russian intentions in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Military affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Cold War</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>President, United States of America</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003d4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
