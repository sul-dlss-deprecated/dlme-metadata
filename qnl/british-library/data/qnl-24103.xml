These visas were asked for orally by your representative and no covering letter was forwarded to this Office• 2.

On discovery of his mistake, the passport of the right Mr. Chariton(Henry Hastings Chartton) No.479 10 was brought together with a covering letter, and the visas were then issued accordingly.

Dear Russell Brown, Consular Fees * We have had strict instructions to recover consular fees in cash, or by cheques when large amounts are involved, before affixing and cancelling consular stamps. This means that we shall not be able in future to stamp passports and other documents sent by your company unless we either have a credit balance in our running account with you, or receive cash or a cheque each time we are asked to perform consular duties on your behalf. 2, If it would not be too inconvenient for you, we should prefer the second alternative as It would save considerable accounting work in our office. This is the practice in the case of all other companies and firms in Bahrain. 3. Would you be good enough to let me know if you agree to this procedure in future? Yours sincerely. Mr.R.M. Brown, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Co.Ltd., Awali, Bahrain.%xo 'DHGENT' No.205^,-28/29. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. 26th June, 1960. Dear Sir, I have to inform you that your deposit with us is now showing a debit balance. I shall therefore be glad if you will arrange to settle your account for the month of May, a statement of which was sent to you on the 4th of thr$ month. From a review of the accounts for the last two months, I find that your deposit ha^ been running at a debit at different times which causes difficulties in accounting to the Foreign Office; since it may not be possible to render accounts earlier than the tenth of every month, might I suggest you either give priority to settling your account or consider raising the amount of. your deposit with us by a further Rs.1,000/-, which would bring up the total amount of your deposit to Rs.4,000/-.
