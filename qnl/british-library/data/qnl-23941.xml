Foolscap size. Autotaatic Fee^. Special price....fc. 920 • 0. (f. o. b. Bahrain.) Nett. Main improved features of the Gestetner 66, which were shewn at the demonstration, are briefly outlined below. The Gestetner is a clean and simple duplicator to handle. Ink distribution is even and automatic. Colour change can be affected in a few minutes. Being fully enclosed, dust, grit and moisture are excluded from its mechanism. Its life is thus considerably prolonged. ^ ^ Gestetner 66 is fitted with an improved, self-adjusting push type feed, which automatically adjusts its grip to paper of any thickness. Accurate registration is also obtained. It is protected against accidental damage by a metal cover. The feed-board accommodates 500 sheets of paper. Being an integral part of the machine, it cannot be damaged or mislaid. A recording counter is fitted, which can be set to count the number of copies printed. This will be found of considerable value in reproducing work of a confidential nature. The Gestetner 66 will, automatical]y, feed-in, print, count and deliver anyt Page TWO, number of copies required, at a speed of, approximately, two to three thousand copies per hour. The Gestetner is fully guaranteed by us A few specimens of work, reproduced on the Gestetner, are attached. Awaiting further instructions. Yours faithfull; D.

Dear Sir, ^ m E We acknowledge your letter 2329/-17/181 dated 3lst December 1942 in which you request a replacement Silk Carrier for Gestetner Rotary Dupli- Unfortunately our stock of these carriers is almost exhausted and we find replacements of these and all Gestetner parts exceedingly difficult to obtain. Our last order on Bombay in August 1941 was not filled and in this connection we quote an extract from a letter written to us by Messrs. Caltex (India) Ltd. at that time. 'Regarding the balance of your requisition we are informed that they (Messrs. Gestetner (India) Ltd.) have no stock of the items called for in India and that if an order is placed with them, they will have to order the goods from their Works in England'. We reordered from London in September 1941 and the material was not received here until June 1942. We are sure you will appreciate that whilst we are anxious to assist, for the present, conditions make it impossible for us to supply this May we suggest that possibly a thin gauze or light open-woven fabric of silk or cotton would serve fairly satisfactorily for a time and might be obtained locally. cator. item Yours very trul W.
