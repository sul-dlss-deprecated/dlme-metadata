JSir, Foreign Office, July 6, 1905. WITH reference to your letter of the 1st March, and to previous correspondence regarding the Muscat Arbitration, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, that it is necessary to appoint an Agent to attend the Tribunal which will meet at The Hague on the 25th instant, for the purpose of serving as an intermediary between the Court and His Majesty's Government. Mr. Ronald Graham, a First Secretary in His Majesty's Diplomatic Service at present employed in this Office, has been selected for this appointment. Lord Lansdowne would propose, for their Lordships' consideration, that Mr. Graham should be granted a subsistence allowance of 306'. a-day during the term of his employment at The Hague, and that he should also receive his actual expenses of travelling and locomotion, together with the cost of a room for the transaction of official business. Mr. G. A. Mounsey, a Third Secretary in His Majesty's Diplomatic Service, has been appointed Secretary to assist the Agent. As Mr. Mounsey is at present employed in His Majesty's Legation at The Hague no special allowances for accommodation or maintenance will, in his case, he necessary. Lord Lansdowne desires to reserve, for future consideration, the question of granting gratuities to Mr. Graham and Mr. Mounsey in respect of their special services on this occasion. It is desirable that Mr. W. F. Craies, who, as their Lordships are aware, has been retained for the preparation of the British Case, Counter-Case and Argument, should accompany the Agent to The Hague to act as Counsel. Lord Lansdowne would be obliged if the Earl of Desart would undertake, as in previous cases, to come to an arrangement with Mr. Craies as to the terms of his service. It has been suggested that Mr. Craies sHould receive a fee of 100 guineas, together with a subsistence allow ance of 305. a-day while absent from England and his actual expenses of travelling and locomotion. I am to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will take these proposals into favourable consideration and sanction the expenditure which they entail. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) T. H. SANDERSON.

Sir, I have the honour t,o acknowledge the receipt/ this day of your telegram No.ms n.B. dated 14th Instant, and, as the mail for Bushire left yesterday, oeg to submit the follow ing few remarks to save tine, 2. - The French Vice Consul received the terms of the award from Paris three days ago, and at once visited His High- ness the Sultan, whom he informed, without explaining the terms at any length, that the British and French Governments had agreed that the statu quo was to be maintained until the arrival of Monsieur Laronoe in October next. He then came to this Consulate and told me the same story adding that I Yfou3d no doubt receive instructions accordingly. 'Phe fact Is that M on sieur Billecocq is intensely disgusted at the result of the yt arbitration and does not wish to be employed in any ^adjust ment of the situation# f r • .j £* y v![ - I fear that it will oe difficult to ascertain th^ dates of the grant of a3 ji the flags, and I foresee the same obstacles which we encountered in our efforts to obtain parti cularsoulars of tihe dhow owners. I will endeavour t&gt;o forwai^p a st.at»e~ menx. oy next» mail* 4.- fltih reference t.o t»he therms of t.he award I would ask whether. In t.he case of persons who were not» under French prot«ect»ion prior t.o 186 ,r Dut» were authorised oy France t&gt;o fly her flag before January 2nd I8fe8, t»he aut»horlsat»ion is held t»o havn Deen given in respect# of (1) a31 the dhows possessed oy tihe owner or (S) particular dhows only ; and if the latter, whether a dhow which has oeen destroyed or become worn out is allowed to be re placed and the ^Vench f!!ag transmitted to It ? ^rom paragraph (S) of the award I infer that authorisation Is held to be In a general sense, whereas paragraph (R) clearly points to its being considered to relate to certain dhows only. Beyond this the terms present no difficulty to me except that the inviolability of the authorised dhows in the territorial waters of Oman might lead occasionally to unpleasant Incidents# I do not however anticipate any trouble either for myself or my successors so long as Monsieur Laronce remains In Muscat. Paragraph (^) is most excellent, covering as It does by far the most important point, 6,- I may ooserve that the award is very favourably regarded in fuscat, and His Highness the Buitan has aire dy expressed his satisfacoion at the general result of tfce aroitratic 6.- A oopy of this letter will be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, rfushire.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith for your information a copy of letter No.410 dated 17th August 1905, and its enclosure which I hav^ addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have t.he honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Major. Offg: Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, MUSCAT.STEPS TO BE TAKEN LOCALLY, f M22 I have already given by 'Delegraph the opinion that, tooth if or the sake of peace in the future and with the otoject of having sun arrangement made which will prevent doubtful and disputed points cropping up afterwards, it would toe 'better to induce the French Government to agree to a mutual settlement toeing come to locally. If this is impossible it is not easy to see what had toetter toe done without French assistance. His Highness the Sultan is averse to issuing a. proclamation, he would prefer to let the new state of things toe announced to the Sur community toy his Wali there and to see what the result will toe. He is of opinion that many of the flag holders will want to give up their flags at once, tout that others will still hold out and refuse to recognise orders from anyone tout the French Consul. The question of coercion on His Highness' part will then have to toe considered. His Highness has asked me whether he will now toe allowed to accept flags etc,, from those wishing to give them up,. I presume as all question of their not toeing his subjects is removed the reply is an affirmative one. When the result of this announcement toy the Wali at Sur has been seen we shall know what to do next. JL am strongly of opinion that everything must toe avoided as far as possitole which would tend to hurt the feelings of the French. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;!&amp;&amp;&amp;)&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;r n r 9 ^ &lt; V. /v&gt; o . jr- - ¥I®/fS ON THE TERMS OF THE] AWAED. i 4 n V Paragraph On©, requires no remark. ' Two. i: infer from t;lie wording 'owners of dhows who have' et.c ., 'bhat. t.he autrhorisaiDion belongs to t.he owners, whereas paragraph five gives another impression, hence t»he question contained in my letter Ho.407 dated 15th Xnstant. ' Three. Z think there are only two Omani sub jects who will be able to establish a claim to having been under French protection prior to 186g. Four. 1&gt;five. T. fear that awkward incidents on account of this concession will be of occa sional occurrence, for example such as that which took place in April 1902), reported by Major Cox in his letter No. 1152 dated 11th April 190S. If this is inclusive of (1) succession and (2) replacement of a worn out or destroyed ^ y yW 0 Ayjb Dhow, it means that the whole business will \P cp A gradually die out. Ijs extremely satisfactory and will go far towards enabling His Highness the Sultan to excercise that authority at Sur which has been paralysed for so long. The terms of this award I hold with the exception of clause four to bet,o be in favour of His Majesty's Government,, and it. would seem tihat. if* t.iie pract.ice does not, die out, of it.self, the advantages to be gained by the Arabs from the use of a Foreign flag would In consequence of increasing danger in the slave trade, hardly make it worth while for them to retain it. On this account His Highness the Sultan expects that many of them will before long wish to give up their authorisation of their own accord. y * v &gt;m24 DATES OF THE GRANT OP FLASS TO THOSE Oli THE FRENCH LIST ETC., r\ attached statement, is tlie result of enquiry made from Suris, and I think may be considered substantially correct. Where the flags were obtained' in the first instance I have been unable to discover^ i.e. as regards each separately. It appears that only two of the owners have any right to be considered French prot6g6s according to the terms of the award, and the case of one of those I consider to be very doubtful. In the opinion of the Sultan of Muscat and that of every person from whom I have made enquiries on the subject, there are no subjects of Hisl Highness holding French flags whose names are not- in the attached list. I thought it possible that there might be some more who have been or who claim to have been under French protection prior to 18613 but the inference from lines 22 and 24. of page *£ of the French case appears to be that all the Omani flag holders are included in the list. Should the French bring forward any more I think it will be possible to collect sufficient evidence to decide the cases. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;G0C26 TELEGRAIvI TO:- G-rey, Maskat. d/S4tJi.

The Tribunal is now in possession of the Cases and Counter-Cases contain ing the statements of the Parties to the present controversy, and of the facts and documents upon which the Parties base their respective contentions. The object of the present Argument will be to lay before the Tribunal, as briefly as is consistent with clearness, what in the view of His Majesty's Govern ment are the proper conclusions to the drawn, with respect to the matter included in the ' Compromis,' from the statements and documents submitted, and to indicate the irrelevancy, for the solution of the questions in controversy, of a very great portion of the contents of the French ' Memoire '' and ' Contre- Memoire.'I # 00036 I ignifjr 34 of ^ f 4 —f ; Y It is to be observed at the outset that Prance, by adopting the role of defendant in a case in which she is claiming immunity and exceptional treat ment for Arabs in the dominions of their natural Sovereign, has reserved for the ,c Contre- Memoire ' a great part of her own affirmative case, and that the ' Contre-Memoire,' 1 like the ' Memoire,' is very largely taken up by state ments with reference to Great Britain which have nothing to do with the points in dispute, and serve only to distract the attention of the Arbitrators from the points really at issue. It appears to His Majesty's Government that the relevant matters of fact involved in the Case fall within a very small compass, and that for the solution of question mainly, if not solely, of a juridical character, it is unnecessary and improper to enter into speculations or to make allegations as to the diplomatic action or political situation of either of the two Governments concerned. His Majesty's Government submit that Prance does not assist her case by the manner in which motives are imputed to Great Britain or to the British authorities in India (' Contre-Memoirep. 51). His Majesty's Government do not propose to recriminate by any inquiry into the policy of Prance with respect to the coast of Arabia, and are content to examine the acts and claims of Prance with respect to the Treaty of 1844, the Declaration of 1862, and the Brussels Act of 1890, by reference to the conventional rights and duties rising from these documents and to the rules of international law. They will confine themselves to the task of laying before the Tribunal what would appear, according to international law and the terms of those documents, to be the due apprecia tion of the correctness and effect of these claims. It is slated in the Preface to the Prench ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 1) that the Prench ' Memoire'— ' a demontre enfin que la Prance n'a jamais cesse dans ses rapports avec I'lmanat d'observer 1'esprit, comme la lattre, de la Declaration du 10 Mars, 1862. Cette derni^re question est en realite la seule qui devait etre soumise au present arbitrage.' It has already been pointed out in the British Counter-Case (p. 2) that the ' Compromis ' submits to, the Tribunal no such general question as above stated. On perusal of the terms of British Case, p. 2. the Compromis ' and of M. Cambon's letter printed at p. 80 of the Prench ' Contre-Memoire,' it will be clearly seen that no general inquiry is intended as to whether Great Britain or Prance have respected the mutual Declaration of 1862, but a particular inquiry as to whether the grant by Prance of her Aug to subjects of the Sultan is consistent with the Declaration, and a necessary incident of such inquiry, to ascertain what immunities Prance claims to attich, within the Sultanate of Muscat, to the possession of the Prench flag by the Sultan's subjects. In view of the too frequent digressions from the true issue in the Prench ' Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' His Majesty's Government cannot refrain from pressing urgently on the Tribunal the true nature of the issues submitted and the desirability of confining the arguments and conclusions to these issues. PBELIMINAUY OBSERVATIONS. Before passing to the facts and arguments, it is unfortunately again neces sary to dispose of certain preliminary allegations which appear to impugn the good faith of Great Britain. The i' Contre-Memoire ' (pp. 3 to 7) deals with the question of the appearance of the name of His Highness the Sultan as a party to the British Case. In the Briti sh Counter-Case (p. 1) Great Britain has in deference to Prench wishes, deleted the Sultan's name as a party. But it has been pointed out in the Counter-Case (p. 1) and in the correspondence (printed at pp. 39, 40 and 41 of the Counter-Case) that the Prench objection is purely technical, and 910 that His Highness has, in fact, invoked the good offices of Great Britain. The position assumed by GreatlBritain, and objected to by France, is not that of legal guardian of the Sultan, but of a friendly Power selected and requested to lay before the Tribunal the Sultan's experience of the effect on his authority of the action of France with respect to his subjects. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of these documents, the Tribunal will be satisfied of the correctness of the attitude assumed by Great Britain, and that the statement made on p. 4 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' as to the tardiness of the Sultan's assent is erroneous, and that his assent was given so far back as 1903. Whether the Sultan is or is not formally a party to the arbitration, it is essential for the Tribunal to determine the extent to which France is entitled to confer immunity on the Sultan's subjects from the jurisdiction of their natural Sover eign within his own territory. It is suggested in the French Contre-Memoire ' that the British Case is, both in substance and in form, incompati- ' Contre-Memoire p. 3. ^ with ^ of 18 62. It is difficult to see how such a contention can seriously be advanced. To admit its accuracy would be to read the Declaration as precluding Great Britain from ever questioning the propriety of any act done by France as to Oman. If the Sultan happens to agree with one of the two Parties to the Declaration of 1862 that the other is attacking his independence, is it to be said that to support the Sultan in his opinion is to violate his independence ? If, finding that his jurisdiction over his subjects is impaired by the action of one of the two Powers, he consults the other, is the giving of advice on such consultation a breach of his independence ? May he only consult the country against which he feels that he has ground for complaint ? In the same breath France objects that the Sultan's protests were due to British influence, and that the Sultan has locus standi to make any objection at all as to acts affecting his authority over his own subjects, France suggests, and makes it a grouud of complaint, that he Sultan would not have objected to the protection of his subjects by France but for the inter vention of iireat Britain. But if the effect of this action of France is what Great Britain contends before the Tribunal, Great Britain had an undoubted right to complain to France of the breach of the Declaration of 1862, and it is difficult to see how France, after consenting to refer the matter of substance, should take refuse in points of form calculated to have no effect except to retard or prevent the decision of the points of substance. Further, if Great Britain is entitled, by virtue of the Declaration of 1862, to complain of infraction of the Sultan's independence, the Sultan is equally entitled, as an independent Sovereign, to complain, even apart from that Declaration, of interference by France with his jurisdiction over his own sub- „ . „ 0 , jects. The contention that the Declara- ontre- emoire , p, . tion of 1862 is as to the Sultan res inter alios acta, and that he had never been asked to adhere to this Declaration, may be met at once by pointing out that an attack on the Sultan's independence is not res inter alios acta vtihev for the Sultan or for the other party to the Declaration of 1862, and a significant commentary on the French Deelarations is to be found in the letter of M. Ottavi of the 2nd January, 1895, in which he says :— ' Heureusement, Seyyid Feysal, devant I'absence d'une note ecrite, qu'il ■ „ , ' . „ aurait demandee aux Anglais pour ser ' Centre Memoire,' p. 201. . , .. N D , . r , couvnr, n aurait guere ose mterveni d'une manure officace, et se serait borne a faire dresser chaque annee la liste de nos boutriers.' And the undated and unsigned letter, printed at p. 290 of the] French ' Contre-Memoire,' which is not on record in the British Consular archives, if authentic and correctly translated, also indicates that the Saltan thought it dangerous to remonstrate with France.00037 Of course^ without the support of one of the Parties to the Declaration, the Saltan was not in a position to resist infractions of his independence by the other The same observations apply as to tVie rig]its of France in case of any appearance of attack by Great Britain on the Sultan's independence. His Majesty's Government must demur to the accuracy of the statement (at p. 4 of the Contre-Memoire'), that Great Britain has concerned herself ' Contre-M^oire.' p. 4. the relations which exist, or should exist, between the French Hepublic and the Sultan of Muscat than with the question submitted to the Tribunal. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of the British Case and Counter-Case, the Tribunal will be satisfied that Great Britain has confined herself to the statement of the facts with relation to French protection of Omani vessels, and its effect on the jurisdiction and independence of the Sultan, whereas the French Case and Counter-Case are concerned largely, if not mainly, with imputations on the policy and motives of Great Britain, and with matters foreign to the only material question in controversy. His Majesty's Government, therefore, while not contending that the Sultan should be separately represented before the Tribunal, submit with confidence that for the due determination of the Case it is necessary to hear and consider what has passed between the Sultan and France with respect to French claims of protection. In the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 7) the reasons for the reference by Great Britain to the Franco-Muscat Treaty of 1844 are misunderstood. By reason of the most favoured-nation clause in the Treaty of 1844 and the Anglo- Muscat Treaty of 1891, it is necessary for the European Parties to each Treaty to refer to the other Treaty in order to ascertain the full extent of the privileges conferred by it, since both Great Britain and France are entitled to the most favoured-nation treatment. Consequently the Treaty of 1844, though techni cally res inter alios acta, is, by the effect of the clause in question, made material and relevant for the elucidation of the present controversy, and shows that the two Parties to the Declaration of 1862 stand on an equal footing as to exterritoriality in Oman. But it is also essentially material as being, apart from any question of sub sequently developed usngc, the conventional measure of French rights and privi leges in Oman, which is a fact, recognized by France in the contentions based on its terms (' Contre-Memoire,' p. 89); and it is difficult to understand the sug gestion made at page 7 of the 'Contre-Memoire,' that the mere fact of referring to this Treaty or discussing its terms gives an impression that His Majesty's Government claim to exercise a virtual protectorate, and constitutes a fresh, attack on the Declaration of 1832. In approaching a juridical or quasi-juridical question, it is usual to lay before the Tribunal the material which may assist towards its solution. And in dealing with the position of Great Britain and France in Muscat, it is surely not irrelevant to point out the extent to which, at the time of the Declaration of 1862, France had extra-territorial jurisdiction in Oman, and that by the new Treaty of 1891, replacing the older Treaty of 1839, Great Britain acquires no extra, territorial rights which do not equally and automatically accrue in favour of France. Comment is made as to the propriety of the inclusion in the British Case (p. 73) of a statement unofficially communicated by M. Cambon to LordLans- downe on the 14th August, 1901. This statement seems to have been a summary , r/ . of information received from French officials ' Contre-M&amp;noire.' pp. 82-83. i tt' n/r • * ' /-&gt; i. 'i-i- and His Majesty s Government, with a view to elucidate the questions raised therein, obtained from British officials, and communicated to the French Government, the information and observations contained in the documents printed at pp. 75—78 of the British Case. It is expressly stated that M. Cambon's communications with Lord Lans- downe were not official. His Majesty's r.tish Case, pp. 8, . Government made their inquiries and com municated their result in the hope of settling at once the questions which have 1112 led to this arbitration. They consider the inclusion of M.

The British Memorandum was referred to the French Consul at Muscat for his observations, and they are included m ' Contre-M&amp;noire,' pp 252-255. ^ « Contre-Memoire. THE SULTAN'S NOTIFICATIONS. At p 10 of the French ' Contre-Memoire' , a suggestion is made that the translation in the British Case (p. 69) of the Sultan's notification to his sub jects of the 15th June, 1900, is seriously « Oontre-M^moire,' p. 84. inaccurate, in that it is said to omit words occurring in the original . The complaint made in the 'Contre-Memoire ' is in the following words:— ' L ps mots h partiv d'aujourd'hui (en Ardbc i tinin Ifiazal ioum ) et le dernier paragraphe ainsi con^u : qu'il soit hien clair pour uous que cet avis a cours h-partir du 16 Safar, ne figurent pas dans le text public au Memoire Britannique.' The British translation (except as to the date, which, by a clerical error, was given as 14 Safar instead of 16 Safar) is an accurate rendering of the noti fication officially supplied to the British Consul by the Sultan, printed in the Appendix, which will be produced to the Appendix i, p. 43.

The copy supplied to the American Consulate is substantially identical in form with that supplied to the British Consulate, and, in response to inquiries by the British Consul at Muscat, His Highness the Sul tan has stated that the Arabic te^t is a correct copy, corresponding to that which was promulgated among his subjects. The French translation of the document, as printed at p. 84 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,*' and a correct English translation are subjoined in parallel columns:— French Version, Correct English Translation.

According to the view of His Majesty's Government, the notification, read by the light of the events which immediately preceded it, is in no sense a recognition oi litres granted prior to its issue. Immediately before the issue of the notification the Sultan had visited Sar, British Case, Appendix 23, p..'68. and had ithere ireceived and accepted the jEritish.Case pp. psm agreement by the Siiris to surrender all French flags held by them. The document by which this was carried out are printed at pp. 68 and 69 of the British Case, and it is clear from those docu ments and ,from the terms of the notification itself, that the Saltan treated the acceptance of the articles and flags as inconsistent with the allegiance of his subject to him. THE MASIRA INCIDENT. ' At the end of the French Counter-Case (p.(i9} the Masira incident is treated as if it constituted a violation by Great Britain of the Sultan's indepen dence and of the obligations created by the Declaration of 1862. This incident, consisting in the murder of the crew of a British merchant ship wrecked on the Island of Masira, was naturally of a character to call for the close attention of the British Consul. The Consul did go to the island, but the offenders were dealt with by the Sultan himself, and were executed by his men, the British Consul attending, at the Sultan's request. The British Consul held no official inquiry in the island, and confined himself to making inquiries of some of the accused, with a view to establishing the identity of the victims of the massacre THE SLAVE TRADE. It is quite true, as stated at p. 55 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' that the Slave Trade only indirectly concerns the present controversy. But the effect of the French action as to the Brussels Act and of the French claims in Oman is to impede its complete suppression by the Signatory Powers, and also to impede the due execution of the Sultan's arrangements for the suppres sion of the trade in Muscat waters, by' creating a class of native vessels which, according to the French claim, can be policed in these waters only by French war-ships. M. Ottavi, in his letter of the 19th ' P- 247 - Jime, 1895, comments on— ' cette singuli^re recrudescence d'importation de n^gres qui se concen- trerait tout entiere sur le point du Sultanat de Maskat, ou nous avonsleplus d'interets.' The singularity on which comment is made disappears when the facts are considered. 0 They have already been stated, but apparently need reiteration. The part of Muscat where, according to M. Qttavi, the interests of France are largest, happens also to be that occupied by tribes of Arabs who have taken advantage of their, geographical position from time immemorial to engage in * Note. Consulates. . This last paragraph does not occur in the document.as supplied by the Suitaa to fche British and American. 13the Slave Trade. M. Ottavi himself gives an instance of the importation of slaves into Siir (' Contre-Memoire,' p. 265). It has already been stated in the British Counter-Case that over 100 of these Siiris were in 1902 captured in Mozambique while engaged in shipping slaves, and this capture is referred to in M. Kiesel's report of the 13th June, Contre-M^moire, p. 273. 1902, The statement of M. Ottavi that Siiris have been offered the British flag (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 2cl-267 i is wholly unfounded. The Siiris do not love the British flag, because they have experience of the vigilance of British cruisers for the suppression of their slaving on the high seas and in territorial waters under the Treaty of 1873. The interest which Prance has in Siir appears to be the protection of the residents of that place who have French flags, and whose status is the chief matter of controversy before the Tribunal. It is unfortunate that there is a* direct conflict between the reports of British naval officers and Consuls and the officers and Consuls of France, as to whether the Erench flag is used to cover the carriage of slaves into Oman or the Persian Gulf. Each Party naturally believes its own officers, and it is for the Tribunal to decide between the two in any points of divergence which are rele vant to this inquiry. The Prench reports (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 245—251) made in 1895 strongly contest the allegations of Major Sadler, the British Consul at Muscat (British Case, p. 58). But His Majesty's Government venture to submit that it will be impossible seriously to dispute the facts stated in the British Counter- Case (Appendix VII, p. 47) as to the running of slaves by one Salim-ul-Badi under French colours, and it is certainly indisputable that two Omani vessels under the French flag were captured by a British cruiser in 1898 near the coast of Oman with slaves on board, and were tried and condemned by a French Court. There are other instances of condemnation in the French ' Contre-Memoire *' 'Oontre-M^moire,** pp. 65,278» et seq. which, while they eTidence the activity '• Contre-Memoire,' p. 272. and loyalty of French officials, also Appends 6, p. 47. demonstrate that Arab slavers do cover the Slave Trade with the French flag; and the note of M. Kies?l indicates that at a period after 1890, when Madagascar was occupied, the French naval police was relaxed, and that even in 1902 only three vessels were employed to police the ocean between Africa and Arabia. His Majesty's Government would add that in 18981one Salim-bin-Seif was caught shipping slaves in vessels flying the French flag at Pemba or Zanzibar, and was claimed by M. Laronce, the French Consul, as a French protege, and the fact that he was tried in Zanzibar and convicted and his claim to French protection overruled by the Courts, led to considerable discussion between His Majesty's Govern ment and that of the French Bepublic. Into the merits of the controversy it is needless to enter. The important fact is that S dim was in 1898 running slaves under the French flag, and was stated by France to be of Siiri descent. There is clearly a great desire to get Arab vessels under the French flag. It is stated in the French Counter-Case, p. 14, that if all applications made had been granted,' there would be hundreds of Omani vessels under the French flag, and that but for strict administration many more flags would be granted in French Somaliland (p. 107). The statement at p. 60 of the ' Contre-Memoire ' that the International Bureau at Zanzibar has often had to register slave trading by vessels belonging to Arab proteges of Great Britain must be based on some mistake. Examina tion of the Reports of the Bureau discloses only one case of slave-running under the British flag. The vessel in question was captured by a British cruiser, and the number and activity of the British public vessels employed to prevent slave-running make it very dangerous to attempt to carry on the trade.under the British flag. It is to be noted that the Report of the International Bureau for 1899 states that there had been during the year a real recrudescence of attempts to carry on the Slave Trade with the object of meeting the demand for slaves 1400039 in the Ued Sea and Persian Gulf, and that in 1900 the Slave Trade was still goins: on (State Papers, vol. xciv, p. 754). In each of these years a French vessel had been seized with slaves on board. It is attempted to discredit the evidence adduced in support of the British allegations that slave trading still continues from Africa and Arabia to the Persian Grulf, and that the French flag is used at times to cover it. The two Governments naturally rely in the main on the reports which they receive from their officials. The French contention seems to be that no African or Indian in British service is to be believed in any statement which he makes, and that British sailors are induced by desire for the bounties (described in the ' Contre- •« Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 57. Memoire' as prizcmoney) to make Contre-M^moire,' p. 135. imaginative reports. These bounties, be it said, are only awarded after judicial condemnation for slave tradings and inconsiderate or irregular seizure brings reprimand, and not reward. (See &lt; 'The Slave Trade Act, 1873,' 36 and 37 Vict., cap. 88, sections 11—16 ) It is inevitable that in African and Asiatic waters and territories some resort must be made to the evidence of natives; but even allowing a reasonable discount for Oriental inaccuracy. His Majesty's Government submit that the statements on the subject of slave dealing made by Orientals contained in the British Case must carry considerable weight more especially when all that France has to oppose to them is the statements of other Orientals, the Arabs in question, who have a far more direct interest, to deny, than the British witnesses have to affirm, the facts in controversy. Great Britain is justified in drawing attention to the international incon venience caused to the Signatories of the Brussels Act by the refusal of France to ratify Article XLII, and it would seem that the French Commanders of war ships engaged in suppressing the Slave Trade have found it necessary to point . „ 0rt this out to their Government. M. JVIartel, outre-. eiBoire, p. . Commander of the ' Dr6me,' in his report of the 10th December, 1900, says that the refusal to accept the provisions of Article XLII makes it necessary to insist on the importance of enforcing Article XXXIV of the Act as to having the name of the vessel cut in Latin characters on the stern, and the marking of the sail with the letter of the ' port d'attache,' and the register number of the vessel. It has been pointed out in' the British Case (p. 17) that the dhows which were at siir at the date of the Sultan's visit in June 1900 had not com- *' Contre-Meraoire, p. 250. pliad with ^ Artiol e XXXI V. M. Chautemps, Minister of the Colonies, says, in his letter of the 9th July, 1*95:— ' H n'est pas impossible, neanmoins, que des boutres de contrebande arborent illegalement notre pavilion pour se livrer a la traite avec plus de facilite;' A lid Commander Kiesel, in his note of ontre-. moire, p. . the 13th June, 1902, in speaking of the Mozambique coast, says ' Sur cette c6te, d'ailleurs, il y a lieu d'etre tres actif et trfes prudent, parce que les boutres arborent le pavilion qu'ils jugent le plus avantageux a I'instant present. Comme le Portugal y a en permanence un croiseur et plusieurs can- onnieres, que I'Angleterre y a en permanence des batiments, le pavilion fran- ^ais est commode, quand le croiseur fratals n'y est pas.' If Article XLII applied to vessels under the French flag, the abnse of the flag above referred to would be impossible. But the admission of M. Kiesel fully supports the statement made at p. 11 of the British Case, that Arabs who engage in the Slave Trade are fully aware of the gap created by the non-adhesion of France in the meshes of the net which would otherwise completely envelop their nefarious traffic, and the anxiety of France to inform all the world that the ' droit de visite ' does not exist as to vessels flying her flag on the high seas hafc /not failed of its effect on those who seek to avoid the surveillance of an interna tional police.

THE QUESTIONS OF FACT IN VOX, VED. The facts relating to the present controversy are not numerous or compli cated. No attempt is made by France to deny the accuracy of the British account of the incident of the quarantine-breakers, or to suggest that any one of these men was on a vessel under the French flag when sent to quarantine, or when he escaped or when he was recaptured. Under these circumstances Consular jurisdiction over the men seems to have been claimed under the Treaty of 1844 ; at least no other ground is suggested. Nor again is any attempt made to con tradict the substance of the British ac- Britwh Case, p. 21. count of the incidents of Suweik and Pebai. The former case was a claim to deal with the succession to Salim-bin- Mahommed which must have been a question of purely Mahommedan law affecting a native of Suweik. The second related to the use of the French flag by the son of the above Salim. If new papers had been given to the son after the death of the father in 1902, there would have been a breach of M. Cam. bon's undertaking of the 26th June, 1900. Since the delivery of the British Counter-Case a report has been received from Zanzibar that an Arab, who seems Appendix 3, p. 43. fo, the Ali-bin-Salem (No. 17 on the revised French list), has come under suspicion of slave-trading, and has been deprived of his French papers by M. Ottavi, the French Consul at Zanzibar. The references in the French ' Contre-Memoire ' to the Debai incident (pp. 68-69) make it expedient to restate that incident in somewhat greater detail. Debai is on the Pirate Coast, and is not part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and its Chief is one of the Trucial Chiefs referred to in the British Counter-Case, p. 21. The representations made by the French Consul to the Sultan of Muscat seem to have been made in the belief that the Chief of Debai was a dependent or feudatory of the Sultan of Muscat, w-hich is not the case. The French, Consul, also, on the 24th March, 1904, wrote direct to, the Chief of Debai the letter of which ppen is , p. 3. a . g annexe{ J &gt; rjijjg 0 f the British Consul at Muscat, with reference to the Debai case, can in no sense be construed as indicating the exercise of any protectorate over Muscat. On being consulted l?y the Sultan as to the French Consul's communication, the British Consul gave it as his opinion that as the man alleged to have been wronged at Debai was one of the Sultanas subjects resident at Suweik, in Oman, the claim on the Chief of Debai ought to be made by the Sultan, and not through the French Consul. 16.17 The first question of fact is whether France has granted to subjects of the Sultan French .flags and papers. The recital of the ' Compromis ' consti tutes an admission by France that France has granted French flags and papers to certain Muscat ship-owners This admission is supplemented by the inclusion in the French Meraoire ' (p. 53) and ' Centre•Memoire,' p. 297 of two lists, headed ' Proprietaires de Boutres mascatais francises.' The Tribunal is not asked to decide anything except as to dhows owned by subjects of the Sultan and flying the French flag or furnished with French papers, and as to the families of such persons, and as to the captains and crews of such vessels, and perhaps also the families of these latter persons. It is for France to show that persons falling within these categories have been lawfully trans ferred from their natural allegiance to that of France, or have lawfully been brought under French protection either before or by means of the francisation which is alleged to have taken place. His Majesty^s Government have no doubt that if any such persons have, by false statements or fraudulent devices, imposed upon French officials and improperly obtained/mrama^o^, the Gov ernment of the French Republic, on ascertaining the truth, would not hesitate to strip them of the privileges which have been thus improperly obtained ; and His Majesty's Government submit with confidence that they have established that the Siiris in question are originaires of Oman, and are not settlers or residents in French Colonies, but sailors whose home is in Oman, paying busi ness visits only to various ports in the Indian Ocean. If the French contention were right, it would be open to content that the French fishermen who annually, for long periods, visit Iceland or the New foundland banks, and only return home for the winter, have not their domicile in France. It is not clear whether France contests the accuracy of the statement that the Signatories to the undertaking given in June 1900 to the Sultan at Siir are natives of, and resident in, Oman. The letters of some of these men con- ' Memoires,' p. €5-70. tf' T™* allegations as to visits to French Colonies and having been in French service ; but these assertions made with the object of obtaining French protection cannot be accepted in the absence of corroborative evidence. It appears to be admitted by France in the recital of the ' Compromis/' and in the two lists of dhow-owners, that Omanis are in possession of French B.itbliConDter Cass, p.» and papers. _ These lists have already been criticised in the British Counter- Case, and the identity of the persons specified therein to some extent ascer- ' Contie-M^moire,' p. 297. t ai ° ed : The revised list in the Preneh ' Contre-Memoire' differs from that in the original Case by omitting four names :— Selim-ben-Rachid (No. 20 in first list) ; Selim-Bouheti (No. *1 „ ); Selim Mohammed Libadi (No. 23 in the first list, the man whose doings are described somewhat fully in the British Counter-Case p. 47) ; and . Salim-bin-Mohammed Wad Taheb (No. 27 in the first list); by ascribing to Ali-bin-Salim-bin-Eachid (No. 2) a second vessel, and by ascrib ing to Ali-bin-Salim Wad Taheb (No. 17) four vessels which in the first list were ascribed to Salim-bin-Mohammed Wad Taheb. From the Report printed in Appendix No. 3, p. 43, it would seem that the French titre and flag of one of the four vessels—the Fath-el-Kheir—has very recently been taken away by the French Consul at Zanzibar. No details whatever are given as to the grounds on which the dhow-owners on the lists were placed there, nor where, nor why these Arabs got French papers.Instead of giving this information, it is contended that— k France ne saurait reconnaltre au Sultan de Mascate 1'exercice d'un contrdle sur roetroi du pavilion tricolore dans les Colonies ' Contre-M^moire,' p. 8. frangaises ; cette pratique etant basee sur le droit interne de l^JStat fran^ais.' This contention evades the question in dispute. It is not necessary to inquire as to the municipal law of France with respect to the grant of the Trench flag to ships, so long as the ships in question remain in French waters. Nor is it necessary to inquire as to the effect on the high seas or in the waters of third Powers of the French law as to the grant of the French flag. 'What the Tribunal has to consider is whether France can, under cover of her munici pal law, give to subjects of another Power in the territories and waters of that Power an extra-territorial and privileged position and exemption from the laws of their natural Sovereign. According to the view of His Majesty's Gov ernment, the contention of France is that the municipal law as to the grant of flags is to prevail outside her own territory over international law and the municipal law of other States. And after thus disposing of the claim of the Sultan to information as to the reasons for withdrawing his subjects from his jurisdiction, it is further suggested that « Contre-M^moire, 1 pp. -8. Great Britain is guilty of a, petitio princif pii in treating as settled a priori in favour of the Sultan the question of the slatut personnel of all the dhow-owners who are originaires Oman ou sup poses tels, and who have obtained French papers, and France not only makes express reserve against the British view, but also appears to deny any obliga tion to give any written explanation of ihe grounds on which each titre was granted. What, according to the French view, is the sfotut personnel of a Moslem Arab born and residing in Oman, who has wives in the various ports to which he takes his ship in the sailing season, and who flies the French flag ? Is his right to marry, or the transmission of his property, determined by the ' Code Napole on ' or by the Koran ? Does he retain his slatut personnel as an Omani Arab, with a right to decline the jurisdiction of the Court best competent to determine the appropriate prescriptions of the Mohammedan law ? The natural and ordinary.presumption as to a person who is originaire of a particular State is that he is the subject of the Sovereign of that State. Where he is not only an originaire, but also ordinarily resident in that State, the presumption is strengthened. And if any State claims that a person born and ordinarily resident in another State is a subject or protege 'of the first State, it is in accordance with all rules of law and justice that the claiming State should furnish proof of the grounds of its claim. It is true that under certain conditions in modern times what is termed ' double nationality ' arises. For instance, a Frenchman duly naturalized in the United States may, never theless, continue to be a French citizen if he has not satisfied his obligations under French military law or other laws. In such a case the United States, though always ready and constitutionally bound to afford the amplest protection to its citizens throughout the world, recognizes that a Frenchman naturalized in America under the conditions indicated has no claim to American protection in France. The same principle is recognized by the British Naturalization Act, 1870. When an originaire of any State is claimed as citizen or protege of another it is juridically impossible to suppose that the Sovereign is bound to accept the mere statement of the Agents of the other power that the person claimed is its subject. In an ordinary European State such a claim would, of course not have much effect, since the system of exterritoriality is not there recognized * but in a State in which exterritoriality or immunity from local jurisdiction is recognized by Treaty or usage, it is essential, to prevent abuse, that the person claiming immunity from the local authorities, or the owner who claims it for him should prove that he falls within one of the categories of privileged19 persons. To hold otherwise would be to allow the claiming Power to be its own judge on controverted questions of fact and law and of the interpretation of Treaties. In this Arbitration it devolves on Prance to lay before the Arbitra tors the grounds on which she seeks to withdraw from the Sultan those of his subjects whose names appear on the lists already referred to, or others of his subjects who, though not on the lists, may be in comimili cam. The knowledge of the grounds for granting Jranciration or Prench flags to such vessels or persons is peculiarly within the reach of Prance, and is not accessible to Great Britain nor to the 'M^moire,' p. is. Sultan of Muscat. It is stated that registers exist at Muscat of all Arab vessels which have been francises and of their owners and captains. It is known that Hires are granted to their vessels. The copies of such litres which have reached His Majesty's Government indi- . cate that if these litres are properly filled in, abundant indications will be afforded of the place where the proprietor is said to reside, where his vessel was francise and the like, although, as has been pointed out in the British Case, pp. 16, 45-47, in certain of these titres most essential information, viz., as to the residence of the proprietors, has been omitted. Prance seems also to object that Great Britain is not entitled (' qualifiee ) to verify the list of Prench dhow owners, •'Gontre-M^moira,' p. 8. because this would involve a critical examination of French municipal legislation. Great Britain has no interests in, and makes no claim to examine into, French municipal legislation ; and is content to take the statement of Prance as to what such legislation is. But, as already stated, when Prance seeks to give extraterritorial effect or international validity to her municipal legislation, then the right of foreign Powers arises to question the validity and effect of such legislation outside its proper bounds. The Prench arguments as to making domicile a ground for claiming an oHginaire of Muscat as a Prench protege in Muscat have already been dealt with in the British Counter-Case (p. 10). It is enough to refer the Tribunal to these arguments and to add the following remarks : 1. Domicile is not equivalent to nationality. 2. Domicile may give certain rights in the country in which it is acquired, and may alter the statut ^personnel or the descent of property by virtue of the xvIq mobilia sequuntur personam, but it gives no title to protection as a national in other countries, least of all in that of origin. 3. It lies with those who assert that the domicile of origin has been lost to prove the assertion. Prance has not adduced any evidence at all that any of the dhow owners of Muscat origin have acquired a domicile in any [French possession. The Tribunal is, on this point, referred to the latest judicial exposition of the subject in the English Courts (Winans v. Attorney-General, Law Heports, 1904, Appeal Cases, p. 287)—a case^ in which the liability to taxation of the personal estate of a deceased American subject depended on whether he had become domiciled in the United Kingdom. EIGHTS OP POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TERRITORIAL WATERS. It is not easy to see what bearing this question has upon the point sub mitted for decision in this Arbitration, but as it is very fully discussed in the Prench ' Contre-Memoire,His Majesty's Government think it right to make some observations upon it. Perusal of the French ' Centre-Memoire ' discloses a tendency to confusion between three very distinct questions 1 The ' droit de visite,' or right of search on the high seas;20 2. The police powers of territorial Sovereigns in their own waters; and 3. The extent to which a Power can exercise supervision or jurisdiction over its own vessels in the waters of another Power by permission of that Power. The question of the &lt;c droit de visite ' has only an incidental bearing upon the present controversy.. It is well known to all students of international law r that France, for many years, whether from Contre-M^moire,' p. 54. national sentiment, as suggested in the « Oontre-Memoire, ' or from particular theories of international law, has been resolutely opposed to granting to any other Power the right to search vessels carrying the French flag on the high seas, * KiM error as of 1887 in the and that the naval instructions of 1867* British Case. mark the Utmost limit of French conces sions to Great Britain on this point. Other powers which have taken the • French view have, by adherence to the Brussels Act, assented to the search of certain vessels under their flag found in the Indian Ocean, and to that extent have granted the ' droit de visite.' It is asserted that British officers have on occasion shown an excess of zeal or have gone beyond the instructions of 1867. Whether they have done so is wholly immaterial to the present 'Centre-M^moire,pp. 125-149,160,-163. andHis Majesty's Government do not think it necessary to discuss each case in detail, and are content to point out that Article 13 of the instructions indicates the remedy to be pursued. Not content with a wholly unnecessary elaboration of French policy as to the' droit de visite,' the « Contre-Memoire' under some misunderstanding puts forward the supposition that Great Britain denies or questions the rights and privileges of the French flag on the high seas. As between Great Britain and France, the question of the 'droit de visite' has passed from the stage of international controversy to that of con vention by the regime agreed on in the Joint Instructions of 1867. As to other Powers which have acceded to the Brussels Act, ' droit de visite ' in the Indian seas is mutually conceded by the Brussels Act. His Majesty's Government can well conceive that a Power to whose subjects France has granted French papers and quasirprotection in the manner adopted as to Omanis might claim as against France to defeat such usurpation by search even on the high seas of such vessels; but it is not necessary to deal with any such contention in the present case. Before leaving this subject, it is, however, desirable to explain to the Tribunal that the desire of Great Britain that there should be a mutual right of search over native vessels in seas frequented by slavers—a desire which has been accomplished by the accession of almost every Power except France to such an arrangement—was to secure an effective international police of the infested seas instead of the isolated and ineffective national system which France prefers. Nothing was further from the desire of Great Britain than, as is suggested in the French ce Contre-Memoire,' to destroy the influence of France in these seas. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government must protest against the wholly gratuitous introduction of two documents relating to questions which arose between great Britain and the United States in 1857 and 1858 as to vessels suspected of fraudulently using the American flag. The full text of the correspondence is to be found in the British ' State Papers, ' volume xlviii, pp. 1244rl250, and volume xlix, p. 1103, et. seq., and no doubt also in the American diplomatic correspondence. Great Britain and the United States were in perfect accord as to the necessity of stopping the oversea traffic in slaves under the American flag, and as to the accuracy of many, if not all, of the British statements. The only difference between the two Powers was as to the nature of the visite which a British vessel might make to a vessel on00042 the liigTi seas flying American colours, and the United States were so far convin ced that their laws and surveillance were insufficient that more cruisers were detailed to suppress the ahuse of the flasr, 'State Papers,' vol. xhx, p, 1118. j xi, j. ttti i -j-x J j. o and that a Bill was submitted to Congress to strengthen the law against slave trading. The Tribunal will also remember that the United States, in 1892, adhered to the Brussels Act. The right of police in territorial waters is wholly distinct from the ' droit de visite.' Ihe latter applies only to the high seas—the highway of nations. But it seems to be as fully admitted as any doctrine of international law that a public vessel of one State has no right to exercise police powers even over the merchant vessels of its own State in the territorial waters of another State. To quote the opinion of Mr. Nelson, Attorney-General of the United States, given in 1813 in the case of the schooner ' Ariel'**-. 'It is quite clear that the seizure of an American vessel by another, also American, Opinions of United States' Atfcorney-fleneial, Vol- within the jurisdiction of a foreign Government IV, p. 285, November 29,1843. for an infringement of American revenue or navi gation laws is a violation of the territorial authority of the foreign Government/' Opinions to the same effect could be multiplied, but it is enough to say that it is an essential element in the conception of independent sovereignty that no foreign Power should, without the consent of the Sovereign, exercise within his territory or waters any coercive jurisdiction over any person. It is, of course, within the competence of the territorial Sovereign expressly to grant or to acquiesce in the exercise within his waters by the public vessels of another State of powers of surveillance or police over merchant vessels flying the flag of that State, and much of the French Case is taken up by an attempt to prove that this concession has been made to Trance by the Sultan of Muscat, or that this power has been, by Treaty, or acquiescence, or otherwise, acquired by France. France claims that in the waters of Oman she has acquired in some such way the sole right of surveillance or police over vessels flying the French flag, and that the territorial authority of the Sultan is excluded. Her contentions have somewhat shifted on this point. In March 1902 the French Consul wrote to the Sultan that France only British Case, p. 72-73, claimed the right of surveillance and British case', p. 26. police conferred by the Brussels Act over vessels flying the French flag. It has already been pointed out in the British Case that the Sultan is not a Signatory to that Act, and that it does not give any Power any right of surveillance or police in the waters of another Power, though it does Rive to the Powers whch ihave adhered to Article XLII a mutual right of search on the high seas. In 1903 M. Cambon stated to Lord Lansdowne that the Treaty of 1844 was not designed to meet the case of the British Case, p. 25. dhow owners, that their rights were in many cases anterior to the Treaty, that the French flag holders were altogether outside the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers, and were entitled to fly the French flag. This contention has already been, stated and criticised at page 25 of^the British Case. But France has now abandoned the contentions of M. Laronce and M. Cambon, and in the (&lt; Contre-Memoire' for the first time takes up the position that she is entitled under the Treaty of 1844 to the exclusive right of police in Muscat waters over vessels flying the French flag. The arguments in support of this contention are, for the most part, con tained in the opinion of M. Renault, i/i ' Contre-M^moiro,' p 150. limine, His Majesty's Government ven ture to point out that, eminent as is the reputation of M. Renault, his opinioncan have no other effect on this arbitration than that of an advocate consulted by one of the High Parties to the arbitration, and that the case submitted to him for his opinion is not included in the ' Contro Memoire. Great Britain contends (1) that Prance cannot rely on the Brussels Act to- justify the exercise of police powers in those waters^ because the Sultan is not a party to that Act, and .because that Act specially reserves the rights of the territorial Sovereign as to vessels in his waters; ('-) that the Sultan has done no act to surrender or delegate to Prance his authority in his own waters. 1. It is difficult to see how Prance can juridically meet the first of these contentions. Indeed, she endeavours to do so mainly by suggesting that the Slave Trade Treaties between Great Britain and Mascat upset the balance and equality which ought to result from the Declaration of 1862. Ihis contention, has already been disposed of in the British Counter-Case (p. 33}. 2. But the second contention is that which the weight of M. Eenault's i opinion is directed to meet. Prance admits that the Sultan of Muscat— ' possede les droits que luf confere la souvera- ' Contre Memoire ' p. 37. inete sur ses sujets et dans ses Etats:^ and includes in this admission the right to make Quarantine Regulations, but makes a grievance of the fact that the « Contre-Memoire,' p. ss. Sultan, in enforcing the Regulations, has utilized the services of British subjects, for getting that if the right exists it is for the Sultan to decide on the executive agents to be chosen. After these admissions and this complaint, a distinct and definite proposition is- enunci ated :— ' Si le Sultan de Mascate possede dans ses eaux territoriales un droit de polke et de •juridictipn 'a I'egard des navires arborant le ontre emoire, p. . pavilion rouge Mascatais, il n'en possede aucun sur les navires, boutres, ou autres qui portent le pavilion tricolore' To prove this proposition it is argued that ships flying the Prench flag fall within the words of the Treaty of 1844), Article 111/ Examination of that Article, which is printed at p 6 of the British Case, will show that it begins by granting permission to Prenchmen to buy,, sell, or take on lease lands, houses, and shops in Oman, and prohibits entry, on any pretext, into the houses, shops, and other properties (' autres proprietes , ') possessed or occupied by Prenchtnen or persons in Prench service. It is perfectly clear from the context that the Article relates to ' c immeubles,' and gives' aux fra^ais'' a right to acquire them, and that in the second place it provides against violation of the domicile of ' fran9ais' who have acquired „ • . „ such immeubles,' and of persons in 'Contre-Memoire, p. 151. ., . . xt , i • • ,1 A . . , their service. .Nothing m the Article can be reasonably extended to ships, and though M. Eenault so contends, he does so faintly, saying that if the action of the territorial Sovereign is restricted on land, ' on peut affirmer qu'a plus forte raison elle Test et doitl'^tre, pour les eaux territoriales.' This amounts to reading into a document, on theoretical grounds, words which do not occur in it and are in no way necessary for its correct interpretation. The Treaty is not silent about Prench ships, but ifs articles do not contain, any express provision as to Prench vessels in territorial waters, or excluding the right of police by the Sultan, and do not give any colour to any theory of exemption from visit. Such an exemption would be inconsistent with the right to enforce the Bevenue, Customs, and quarantine laws of Oman, for which pur poses it is essential to board and examine vessels entering at Oman ports ; and it can hardly be regarded as a necessary part of a Treaty to facilitate commerce that smuggling by the ships of a foreign State or disregard of quarantine should be made easy. Ml. Renault, after dealing somewhat lightly with the exact wording of the Treaty of 184^, devotes a great part of his opinions to arguments based partly 2223 on views of French national policy or tlis manifest intention (' esprit mani- feste') of the Treaty, but mainly on allegations of established usa^e, which, in his view, interpret or supplement the Treaty in a manner harmonizing with the Erench contentions. The statements of facts and the diplomatic documents to which he refers relate wholly and solely to Zanzibar, and not a single fact is stated with reference to the express or tacit admission in Oman of the existence in favour of Prance of the exclusive right of surveillance over Prench vessels in Oman waters. The French Treaty of 1844 applied to Oman and Zanzibar as a single State for twelve years, until the separation of the two territories into distinct States in 1856. Thenceforth it was recognized by the Sovereigns of the two States as applying to each State separately. Nothing that happened between Prence and Zanzibar between 1866 and 1905 can be construed as binding the Sultan of Muscat either as matter of usage, concessions, or interpretation of the Treaty. The earlier Colonies in the Indian Ocean possessed by France were near Zanzi bar and far from Muscat, and France had to little concern with Oman that it was not until 189i that she installed a Vice-Consul there, or instituted any Court in which any person claiming to be her protege could be dealt with judicially. Nor is there any trace in the French ' Memoire' or 'Contre- Memoire' of any grant of French flags to Muscat vessels before 1891, or of any exercise by France of rights of police in Oman waters before that date. It is unnecessary to deal in detail with the various controversies which have arisen between Great Britain and France as to the territory and waters of Zanzibar, because they have, fortunately, been terminated by the arrangement evidenced by the letters of the 13th and Append.! 4,p. lgth May)1904 But His Majesty's Government cannot be considered as admitting that the contentions of France with respect to Zanzibar were juridically well-founded, although in a spirit of amity an adjustment has, in the case of Zanzibar, been effected which satisfies the aspirations of both Powers and meets the needs of the situation. M. Benault's arguments as to the effect on the status quo ante of the estab lishment of a Protectorate relate only to Zanzibar, and in no way affect Oman which is not a Protectorate. Before passing from this part of the Case, it is perhaps well again- to point out that the main point in controversy is not whether France, has any power to Police in Oman waters vessels admittedly French, but whether France, by per mitting the use of her flag to persons who are not her subjects nor her proteges, nor within the immunities given by the Treaty of 1844, can extend to such persons any immunities she may possess in Oman. Even assuming that France had acquired some modified rights in Oman waters over vessels admittedly French, this is a very different thing from the claim of exclusive police in the Sultan's waters by French officials over any Arab dhow which flies the French flag. Still more does it differ from the claim which has hitherto been coupled with it that the owner and crews of such vessels and their families shall be exempt when ashore from the Sultan's jurisdiction. The true international rule on this subject is well stated in the decision of the United States' Supreme Court, of which an extract is given in Appendix, p. 5. THE CAPITULATIONS AND EXTEEEITORIALITY. A considerable portion of the French Counter-Case (pp. 39 et seq.) is taken up by arguments that the ' regime des Capitulations ' applies to Muscat. These arguments, except so far as they are based on Treaties with the Sultan, or established usage in his dominions, are an attempt to import into the relations of France with Oman usages which may exist between France and other Oriental States.24 It is acknowledged that Capitulations and Treaties or Conventions creatin g exterritoriality are exceptional and contrary to the ordinary rules of public international law, and that the exceptions arise from particular sanctioning documents or concessions from the Sovereign of the country to which they apply. As a general rule, therefore, la order to ascertain what extent the territoriel Sovereign is excluded from jurisdiction over the subjects or proteges of another Power, it is necessary to examine the Treaties, and, if need be, the usage in force between the territorial Sovereign and the other Power concerned, and it is rarely, if ever, of value to refer to the Capitulations existing with other Powers. Although, where several Powers have with an Oriental State Treaties giving exterritorial jurisdiction couched in somewhat different terms, but containing a most-favoured-nation clause, it may, as in the present case (see onte^ p. 5) be necessarv to examine all such Treaties in order to determine the exact limits of the extra-territorial jurisdiction conceded, it is never admissible to contend that because one Oriental Power has conceded a particular and wide exterritorial jurisdiction, a similar concession should be read into Capitulations made with another Oriental Power ; nor can any argument be drawn from usage in the case of one Oriental Power to establish the existence of any such usage in the case of another Power.* The Ottoman Regulations of 1S63 and 1865, referred to both in the British and the Prench Cases, are relevant only as showing the determination of the Porte to put an end to the abuses of protection which then existed, and of the admission of the European Powers that the attitude of the Porte was consistent both with its territorial sovereignty and with international law, and the fact that these laws were not made retrospective is of no probative value in the present case, in which the question is whether certain persons are or are not now pro perly claimed by Prance as proteges. It may be observed that, under the Ottoman law of Nationality, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject unless he can prove to the c -ntrary, the onus prohandi lying not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction, and ^ the international Award between Greece and Turkey, set out at p. 91 of the British Case, is an even stronger and more authorit'itive international recognition of the limits which should be placed on extra-territorial jurisdiction, in Oriental States. As a matter of negotiation, distinct from a question of fact or of inter national or municipal law, the recognition of the claim of a certain limited number of persons to be proteges of claiming Power might be conceded as a means for determining a controversy, but such concession would be the price of peace, and not an admission of the justice of the claim, and it was as a matter of negotiation that the Porte made the concession in question, and not in affirm ation of any rule of international law. It may be added that in the long history of the Capitulations in Turkey very many Treaties had been made, and very many usages and abuses had grown up in the course of centuries ; while as between Muscat and Prance the extra territorial rights granted to Prance in Oman, whatever they may be, cannot; be dated back beyond 1844. And while the situation in Turkey was complicated by the presence of a very large Christian population of numer- us sects (each sect allowed by the Porte in many matters to be governed by the laws of its Church), perpetually invoking the sympathy and protection of Prance or Russia or some other European Power, the population of Qman is in the main Arab and Moslem, with very few Europeans or Christians, and only a few small communi ties professing some non-Moslem Eastern religion ; and the persons whom Prance seeks to protect (unlike the Banians and Louwatias) are Arabs marked off from the rest of the Arab population of Oman only by the fact of the claim to Prench protection. The chief reason for the existence of exterritoriality is the difference • '« En t.h£se genirale, if fant reconnaitre qu'en pareille mature il pent y avoir des questions i?'espfece 8uivant nature des Protectorats, et, encore, suivant ies engagements des proteges et des protecteurs enveis les autrts uatious.'— M. Bar bey,'*' Contre-Memaire,' p. 213.00044 25 between Oriental and European usages ; and in the case of the Suri Arabs the raison cVtere of a claim of exterritoriality is excluded by the facts of. their origin, race, religion, and residence. Having thus indicated the contention of His Majesty's Government that Capitulations with Turkey do not afford any sound foundation for any argument in favour of France in the case of Muscat, it is necessary, before dealing with that part of the French Case which is based on the French interpretation of the - Contre-M^oire.' p. 24. Treat y of dis P OS0 of Certaln ences made to alleged inconsistency bet- Ween the British contentions and British practice. 1. The position of the Khojas or Louwatias has been fully explained in the British Counter-Case (pp. 35, 73). That explanation clearly shows that these persons, so far from being allincontestably subjects of the Sultan, forma distinct community of Indian origin, and under British protection if they choose to claim it; and that British officials have never gone beyond denying to a Khoja the right to abjure British protection merely as a means of evading just debts. 2. In Persia Great Britain protects her Indian subjects settled there and their descendents to a limited extent, but this right of protection has never been exercised in a way inconsistent with the law of Persia. The British view as to Persia is best expressed in the following extract from a despatch by Lord John Russell to Mr. Alison :— &lt;c Considering the question apart from all questions of usage, policy, or expediency, but exclusively and strictly with reference to the principles of international law prevailing amongst Christian nations, I have to state to you that a child of a Persian father born in the Queen's dominions and returning to Persia will not, whilst in Persia, be entitled to British protection if (as stated) the law of Persia considers him a Persian subject by reason of his Persian descent ; and on this principle Syad Abdullah could not, whilst he remained in Persia, claim, or be claimed to be, treated there as a British subject. Although, therefore, this would be the correct rule of international law, yet, as it has not hitherto been acted on in Persia, I think it very inexpedient that it should now be made a rule of English procedure there unless it is also mad^ common to all other European nations, and especially France and Russia.' 3. Great Britain does not protect Jhinese subjects in Siam either with or „ . ... . „ without a condition as to three years' «Cantre-M^moire,' p. 24. \ residence there. In the year 1895 the question of such protection was discussed between the British and Chinese Gov ernments at a time when it was supposed that Japanese in Siam were to be protected by France. But Japan abandoned the idea of putting her subjects in Siam under Frence protection; and Great Britain never undertook the protection of the Chinese, which, be it said, in the absence of any Treaty bet ween China and Siain granting extra-territoriality, would, if undertaken, not have ousted the jurisdiction of the Siamese Courts. This disposes of the unfounded statement made at p. 24 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' ;— ' An Siam elle admet I'inscription a sa Legation de Chinois qui ne sont pas nes sur un territoirebrittinnique ou place sous le protectorat anglais, mais qui resi dent depuis an moins trois ans a Bangkok. Ces Ohinois sont alors consideres comme proteges britanniques, et ils ont meme obtenu que la protection qu'ils jouissent au Siam leur soit continuee quand ils se rendent en Chine.' • It will be, perhaps, more satisfactory to the Tribunal to know exactly what persons Great Britain does protect in Siam. The matter is governed by the Anglo-Siamese Agreement of the 29th November, 1899, which is in the follow ing terms: —Agreement between the United Kingdom and Siam relative to the Registra tion of British Subjects in Siam. ' Signed at Bangkok, November 29, 1899, 'The Governments of Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and of His Majesty the King; of Siam, recognizing the necessity of having a satisfactory arrangement for the registration of British subjects in Siam, the Undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Minister Resident and His Siamese Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs duly authorized to that effect, have agreed as follows:— 'L ' The registration according to Article V of the Treaty of April 18, 1855,.* of British subjects residing in Siam, shall comprise the following categories : ' (1) All British natural born or naturalized subjects, other than those^ of Asiatic descent. ' (2) All children and grandchildren born in Siam of persons entitled to be registered under the first category, who are entitled to the status of British sub jects in contemplation of Euglish law. ' Neither great-grandchildren nor illegitimate children born in Siam of persons mentioned in the first category are entitled to be registered. ' (3) All persons of Asiatic descent, born within the Queen's dominions, or naturalized within the United Kingdom, or born within the territory of any Prince or State in India under these suzerainty of, or in alliance with, the Queen. ' Except natives of Upper Burmahor the British Shan States who became domiciled in Siam before January 1st, 1886. *' (4) All children born in Siam of persons entitled to be registered under the third category. 'No grandchildren born in Siam of persons mentioned in the third cate gory are entitled to be registered for protection in Siam. ' (5) The wives and widows of any persons who are entitled to be registered under the foregoing categories. II. ' The lists of such registration shall be open to the inspection of a properly authorized Representative of the Siamese Government on proper notice being given. 'III. 'If any question arises as to the right of any person to hold a British cer tificate of registration or as to the validity of the certificate itself, a joint in quiry shall be held by the British and Siamese authorities and decided accord ing to the conditions laid down in this Agreement, upon evidence to be adduced by the holder of the certificate, in the usual way. ' IV. ' Should any action, civil or criminal, be pending while such inquiry is going on, it shall be determined conjointly in what Court the case shall be heard. 26 • Hertslet'n Commercial Treaties, vol. x, p. 557.« V. ' If the person in respect of whom the inquiry is held come within the con ditions for registration laid down in Article I, he may, if not yet registered forth with be registered as a British subject and provided with a certificate of registra tion at Her Britannic Majesty's Consulate ; otherwise he shall be recognized as falling under Siamese jurisdiction, and, if already on the lists of Her Britannic Majesty's Consulate, his name shall be erased. ' In witness whereof the Undersigned have signed the same in duplicate and have affixed thereto their seals at Bangkok, on the 29th day of November, 1899, of the Christian era, corresponding to the 118th year of Batanakosindr. (Seal.) (Signed « GEORGE GBEVILLE. (Seal.) (Signed) « DEVAWONGSE VABOPEAKAE.' On reference to the 1st Article, it will be seen that persons of Asiatic des cent are not entitled to be registered as British subjects in Siam unless— 1. Born within His Majesty's dominions; 2. Naturalized in the United Kingdom. 3. Born within the territory of feudatory or allied Princes or States in British India. The fact of registration is not conclusive (see Article III), and provision is made for settling by joint inquiry the right of any person to hold a certificate of registration, and the burden of proof of the validity of the certificate, is thrown on the holder. Great Britain, is fully aware of the difficulties created by what is termed 'double nationality,' and it is specifically provided by 'The Naturalization Act, 1870,' 33 and 34 Vict, cap. 14, sec. 7, para. 3, that.— ' An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall not, when he was within the limits of the foreign State of which he was a subject previ ously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British sub ject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that State in pursuance of the laws thereof or in pursuance of a Treaty to that effect.' This legislation is in strict accordance with modern views as to nationality, recognizing the authority of the original Sovereign in his own territory, and claiming to protect the naturalized persons only in countries of which he has never been a subject. In Oman Great Britain has never claimed to protect native Arabs unless they were bond fide in the service of British subjects, and in the case of one Ali-bin-Juma, who had obtained naturalization in India, the British Consul, on finding that he was an originate of Oman, struck him off the register of British subject. PKBNCH PRACTICE AS TO ' Jfrancisation' In the Erench ' Contre-Memoire - ' (p. 11) it is said to be quite inaccu rate to make, in general and categorical terms, the allegation that Erench Consuls give protection papers to dhow-owners. His Majesty's Government are not concerned to allege or prove that all Erench Consuls are authorized so to act, and are content to indicate to particular instances in wl^ich they have done so. But it is a mistake to say that Great Britain has only given a single instance as to one port of the grant by Erench Consuls of Erench papers, namely, at28 Aden. The first instance, it is true, is that of the grant of French papers to Siiri vessels by the French Consul at Aden. This action is admitted by France to have been irregular. His Majesty's Government were for some years under the impression that M. Hibot's admission of irregularity was meant to apply to all cases of grant by French Consuls to Siiri vessels, and in the British Case re ference was made to M. Hibot's statement, not to impugn its correctness or pro priety, but to explain that upon a misunderstanding as to its exact effect Great Britain during some years refrained from protests, which would certainly have been made had its true meaning been understood. It is also clear that the French Consul at Zanzibar has in many cases granted, and not merely renewed or prolonged, litres de navigation. This is 'Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 245. admitted in the French Case (p. 14), and in many of the annexed documents, particularly in the report M. Labosse of 22nd May, 1895. It is difficult to understand where the vessels at Sur can have obtained the French papers of which they are in possession. The two lists supplied give no indication. The documents contained in the French Counter-Case (p 107) appear to show— (a)That at Mayotte no titre has been issued for six years, and that they Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 107. are i ssu ed there only to Frenchmen or French subjects. {h) That in French Somaliland it is quite the exception to grant to a ' Uontje-M^moire,' p. 107. dhow the right to fly the , , . ' French flag; and that be- tore grant it is required that the vessel should— 1. Belong to a French Company; or 2. Belong to natives {indigenes) permanently resident (' etablis &amp; demeure ') in that territory and possessing realty there. (c) That in Madagascar, the Department concerned, has always refused «Contre-M^moire,' p. 108. ^ French flag to foreign vessels. It is said not to be a regular practice to grant tttres at French Consulates and it may be presumed that the practice of granting them at the French Con sulate in Zanzibar, which is admitted to have prevailed at one time, has now been discontinued. Where, then, are the titres in question granted ? The natural and obvious conclusion would seem to be that they are granted at Maskat, and it is submit ted that this conclusion must prevail in the absence of more definite explana tions by France as to the origin of these grants. In bis letter of the 19th June, 1895, M. Ottavi says that no dhow had been registered (' mscrit') at Muscat, and that all that he knew on the subiect was that the Vali of Siir had told him there were in Sur thirty dhows francises. M. Ottavi also said that the British list submitted to him must be verified at Majunga (in Madagascar), Obokh, and Mayotte, and perhaps at Zanzibar (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 249-250). It is also stated in the French ' Contre- Memoire' (p. 14) that the French Consul, since he took up his post at Maskat, has made it a rule not to grant titres at Maskat or at Sur. It is diffi cult to reconcile this statement, which is made in a report dated the SOth June' 1897, with the two titres printed at p. 46 of the British Case, the first dated m 1898, the second 1899, both issued at Muscat, and signed by M. Ottavi, who himself made the report in question. The inference appears to be that titres have been granted at Muscat in the first instance, and it seems not to be denied that a practice has prevailed of renewing there titres which had originallv been granted elsewhere. JIt is not easy to make out, from the statements in the French ' Memoire '* and Contre-Memoire,' what is the law under which it is claimed that Trench Consuls may grant or renew litres to native vessels. It was stated in the British Case that the maritime law of France does not British Case, p. 25. contemplate the grant of French papers unless at least half the vessel is owned by French citizens. In the French ' Contre- Memoire ' it is said that this law does not apply to the Colonies, and certain of the laws said to apply to them are given in an Appendix. This statement does not quite accord with the opinion expressed by M. Guy French Consul at Zanzibar, and quoted at page 14 of the British Counter- Case. But assuming M. Guy to be wrong and the statement in the ' Contre- Memoire ' to be accurate, neither Zanzibar nor Muscat is a French Colony ; and the authority of the Consul, if it exist, must be derived from some generai administrative discretion, or from some particular instructions given to him which have not been included in the French ' Memoire ' or ' Contre-Memoire ' or from some law which has not been disclosed. But the Tribunal will find that British Case, p. 49. the Utre g ra ^ed at Aden in 1891 contains a reference to the Law of 27 Vendemiaire, an ii, which is the foundation of the French maritime law and under which hdf the vessel must be owned by French citizens. It has already been pointed •«Contre-M&amp;noire,'p. 91. 0 A U ^ ^at Article XXXII of the Brussels Act affords no warrant for the grant of Hires to native vessels by Consular officers, because the condition precedent to such grant can be satisfied only in a Colony or Protectorate of the power which grants the titre. Until copies of the titres granted to the Siiri Arabs now in question are produced, it is not possible to know the statements as to the resi dence of the owner upon which they were granted. These statements would in any case, require verification. The grant of protection to individuals is closely linked with the francisa- tion of vessels. France appears to contend that the latter turns the captain and crew and their families into French proteges in globo, and that the former has a like effect as to the individual and his descendants. It is not possible to trace in the French ' Memoire ' or ' Contre-Memoire ' any distinct allegation that any,of the Omanis in question are French, either as citizens born or as natura lized in French territory. It is contended in the French ' Memoire' and M contre-M&amp;Boire,' p. 27. ' Contre-M^moire' that the terms of Article I\ of the Treaty of 1844 include not only domestic servants, but also— ' les employes, les commissionnaires, les agents de transport, tons ceux enfin, en un mot, qui rendent bond fide des services pour I'extension des relations com- merciales, dont le Traite de 1844 a voulu faciliter le developpement.'' The contention is obviously wrong. The phrase ' au service ' clearly im plies engagement in the capacity of a clerk or domestic or some subordinate capacity; and it cannot include all persons with whom Frenchmen happen to have contracts of a commercial nature. In order to ascertain whether any one of the ' boutriers originaires de Mascate ' is entitled to French protection in Muscat, the following preliminary questions must be asked :— 1. Has he been naturalized in a French possession under the Decree printed at p. 76 of the French ' Memoire ' ? or 2. Was he born in a French possession of a father permanently establish ed there at the date of the birth ? or 3. Is he bond fide in the service of a French citizen ? It would be very difficult for Siiri sailors to satisfy the conditions of three years 1 unbroken residence in a French Colony required by the Decree above cited. But even if the answer to questions 1 or 2 were 'Yes,' it would not 29conclude the matter, for, as has already been pointed out, naturalization abroad is not binding on the State of origin, unless by the laws or the tacit absent of that State the right to alter allegiance is admitted, nor is birth in French territory of foreign parents conclusive of French nationality, and return to and settlement in the country of the father's origin would be a sufficient election not to rely on the accident of birth. France has not supplied, and says that she is not bound to supply, any in formation whatever as to any of her alleged proteges which would enable the Tribunal to answer any of the above questions. But if the information cannot be supplied her claim 'to protect fails, and her past interference with the Sultan s authority over such persons stands confessed as an unwarranted interference with his territorial jurisdiction. THE EFFECT OF ' FRANCISATION.' It is now proposed to consider what France claims to be the result, in Oman of the francisation of an Arab dhow owned by an Omani. Consideration has already been given to the French claim of exclusive or concurrent rights to police vessels flying the French flag in Oman waters. But it is also necessary to deal with the effect claimed on land, It is submitted that it is clear beyond all controversy that a grant to a vessel of the right to fly the French flag confers on the owner, master, and crew when on shore no immunity whatever from the jurisdiction of the local Sovereign. It is impossible to allow the claim which appears to be put forward by France that the owners and master '* ContreTMdtnoire.' p. as. an (i crew of any dhow under the French flag are entitled to the same exterritoriality as Frenchmen, and that this privilege extends to the members of their family in direct line. No authority for any such claim has been put forward; it is opposed to Cvery principle of la\v. CONCLUSION. The facts disclosed in the former documents have now been reviewed, and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom with respect to the French claims _ have been discussed. His Majesty's Government have refrained from contradicting in minute detail all the allegations contained in the French documents, the majority of which appear to them to be irrelevant to the questions at issue, but they are fully prepared to elucidate, by oral or written statement or arguments, or production of further documents, any points as to which the Tribunal may require more light. They venture to submit that the statements and arrangements of the British Case and Counter-Case have not been met in any way by those in the French 44 Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' and that they are amply justified in main taining that the claim of France to protect 1,000 Omani Arabs and their families in their native country from their natural Sovereign is unwarranted by Treaty, usage, or international law, and amounts to an tittack on the indepen^ dence of the Sultan, which is inconsistent with the obligations of France both towards the Sultan and Great Britain. His Majesty's Government submit that a review of all the evidence and documents establishes the correctness of the following propositions, which are the s ame as those set out in the original British Case : '1. No subject of the Sultan of Muscat acquires any right to, the status of a French protege under the Treaty of 1844 by the fact that he is the owner, captain, or a member of the crew of a native vessel which has, by whatever means, obtained French papers or flag. 5i0« 2. By her adhesion to the XXXIItid Article of the Brussels Act of 1890 France is under an international obligation not to Ff ^ ^ to any native vessel unless its owner, at the time of grant, is ( ) citizen, oris (6) a French protege by reason of his being a subject of a State under French protection. &gt; '3. France is equally debarred by the Dcdaration of l 8 62 from with- drawina any snbiect of the Sultan of Muscat from the jurisdiction of the Sultan bv the Irant of French flags or papers, and the practice which prevailed up June 1900 of making such grants trenches on the independence of the Sultan. « 4 No subiect of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags acquires any immunity from the Sultan's jurisdiction in the territories or territorial waterTrf Omaa either for himself or for the crew of any ship commanded or owned by him, or for any member of his family or for any of his employes. « 5 On the death of the owner of a vessel in respect of which a French one of personal status. # •' R A Hire empowering the flying of the French flag must be granted in respect rf a plrticSar vessel! and cLnot be used by the holder m respect of any other. „ _ '7 France should, with all reasonable despatch, erase from her marine Trench flags and papers now held by any such subjects. «8 In all cases in which Prance still claims as subject or P* ot ^ a ny or protege of France.

Muscat, March. 23rd, 1905, V APPENDIX 3. Extract from a Despatch from Mr. Sinclair to the Marquess of Lansdowne. Zanzibar, May 11th, 1905. (Extract.) An incident has just occurred here which is of interest in that it seems to show that we cannot yet relax the precautions which have been taken in past years for the prevention of slave trading. On the 5th instant Captain Baker-Baker, of His Majesty's ship ' Ternsi- V I - chore, the Senicr Naval Officer of this station, told me confidentialIv that he JtSfk had received reliable information that a dhow called the ' Fath-el-Keir sailing under [French colours, which had arrived here from Sur in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd ultimo, intended leaving the harbour the following evenimr. bhe was then to anchor off a place called Bu-bu-bu, about 7 miles north of tie port, at which place the nakoda, or captain, had previously arranged with some of the natives that ho would call and take on board their cocoanuts so enabling them to evade the payment of duty. By holding out this induce ment he hoped to get about twenty-five of them on board, when it was his intention to confine them below deck and set sail on his return voyage to Sur where it is commonly reported that slaves still fetch from 100 to 200 dollars' that is about 121. to 2U. a-piece. Captain Baker-Baker's difficulty lay in the fact that he could not board a dhow flying the Erench flag without disobeying his instructions from the Admiralty, and, after consideration, we decided that, although the wisdom of the course was doubtful, yet it seemed to be the only plan to take the Erench Consul, with whom our relations have lately been of a very friendlv nature r 11 ^ 0 m 7 c0Ilfidence » ail(i *0 obtain his consent to the boarding of the vessel' I therefore saw M. Ottavi, who readily promised his co-operation. The next day, however, I received a letter from M. Ottavi stating that he had discovered some irregularities in the dhow's papers which gave him the power of refusing to renew her licence to fly the Erench flag, but that he had not then decided what action to take. Unfortunately, that morning, i .e., the 6th instant, Captain Baker-Baker C received a telegram from the Admiral directing him to proceed at once to ^ Durban, and he was, therefore, compelled to place the matter in my hands but left his native interpreter behind, so as to keep me supplied with information. VMr. Rogers, whom I then consulted, at once made arrangements to have the dhow followed in case she slipped off in the night, and on the following 1 day M. Ottavi again wrote to say that he had decided to refuse the renewal of the right to fly French colours to the nakoda, thereby forcing him to apply for a Sultan's flag at the Port Office. It was now fairly evident that we must, give up hope of catching the slavers red-handed, as there could be no doubt that they were aware that they were objects of suspicion, and I therefore decided that when the nakoda applied for his new papers, it might be as well to examine him. This I accordingly did. His name is Ali-bin-Salim Wateib, and he stated that he was a native of Batna, which is, I understand, an outlying part of Muscat, and that he was a subject of the Sultan of Oman. When asked how it was that he had been sailing under Erench colours, he said that his father, also a native of Batna, and a Sultan's subject, who had owned the dhow before him, had been, in the habit of trading between the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, Comoro, and Madagascar, and that, having married a Comoro woman, he was there given French protection and a licence to fly the flag. On the death of his father two or three years ago, he had been allowed to retain the licence, although he was not even a son by the Comoro woman. This appears to be a striking instance of the disregard of the Brussels Act which the French authorities have been in the habit of showing in the issue of their flag to persons who had no claim to it, and there can be little doubt that both the father of Ali-bin-Salim Wateib, who was, I am informed, a well-known slave trader, as well as Ali himself, used the flag thus acquired simply as a protection from interference of British men-of-war. Mr. Rogers has decided to withhold the grant of a provisional licence until the inquiries which he has instituted are completed. It is, of course, much to be regretted that we were unable to effect the capture of the dhow, and make an example of the nakoda and crew, but it may be hoped that their detention here will help to dispel the idea which I hear that the Persian Gulf Arabs seem to hold, that we are no longer on the qu%-'Dwe i and that they can therefore revive their old and nefarious ways with impunity. It is, of course, improbable that many slaves are nowadays shipped away from these islands ; but as I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my despatch No. 31 of the 20th April of last year, it is believed that a certain trade is still done between the Northern Coast of Portuguese East Africa and the Persian. Gulf, and the case of kidnapping at Pemba, to which the above- quoted despatch referred, shows that the presence of a man-of-war is still desirable in these waters, especially during the first four or five months, that is from April to August, that the wind blows from the south-west.

Mon Gouvernement avait mentionne au cours des pourparlers presents qu'une pareille procedure ne serait pas applicable a nos nationaux et ressortissants. II he s'opposerait pas cependant a ce que dans des cas particuliers et avec I'assentiment du Consul de Prance il put ^tre, deroge a cette r^gle a titre tout a fait exceptionnel. L'accord se trouvant ainsi ^tabli, j'ai I'honneur de faire savoir a voire Seigneurie que mon Gouvernement a decide de prescrire la fermeture, h la date du 15 Septembre prochain, du Tribunal Consulaire Pran^ais a Zanzibar: je serais tres reconnaissant a votre Seigneurie de vouloir bien m'accuser reception de cette communication, afin que mon Gouvernement, sur Favis que je lui en donnerai, puisse faire parvenir sans retard a son Representant a Zanzibar les instructions necessaires a I'ex^cution de cette mesure. J'ajoute qu'en ce qui concerne notre office postal, mon Gouvernement prendra des dispositions pour qu'il soit procede sans retard au r^glement 'de ses operations en cours et ensuite a sa fermeture.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 13th instant, recapitulating the conditions of the Agreement which has been arrived at between His Majesty's Government and the Government of the French Bepubllc for the closure of the French Consular Court at Zanzibar, and the recognition by the French Government of the British Tribunals established by the Orders in Council of 1899 for the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba and the continental portions of the Sultanate of Zanzibar placed under British protection. I have pleasure in confirming the Agreement thus come to, the terms of which are correctly described in your Excellency's note. His Majesty's Government take note of your statement that it has been decided to close the French Consular Court at Zanzibar on the 15th September next. His Majesty's Government will make such arrangements as are required on their part for the due execution of those portions of the Agreement which relate to French proteges, and, without entering into the judicial question of the right of the Zanzibar Government to expel the nationals or proteges of foreign Powers by administrative process, they are willing to give an assurance that no such action shall be taken against French citizens or proteges without the concurrence of the French Consul. I take note with satisfaction of your Excellency's statement that it is the intention of the French Government to take measures without delay for winding up and closing the French post-office at Zanzibar. I am, etc.. (Signed) LANSDOWNE. 35APPENDIX 5. Wildenhm* Case. ' Homicide was committed in the course of an affray between two mem bers of the crew of a Belgian ship lying in the port of Jersey City in the United States. A claim was made by the Belgian Consul that the offence was justiciable only under Belgian law, because of the terms of the Convention of the 9th March, 1880, between Belgium and the United States. The controversy was settled in the Supreme Court of the United States by a deoision that the offence was justiciable in the State of New Jersey.' 5 (Wildenhus* Case 1887, reported 7 Supreme Court Reporter 385 and 120 U. S. Supreme Court Reports 1.) Below is an extract from the judgment of Mr. Waite, then Chief Justice of the United States:— {&lt; It is part of the law of civilized, nations that, when a merchant-vessel of one country enters the ports of another for the purposes of trade, it subjects itself to the law of the place to which it goes, unless, by Treaty or otherwise^ the two countries have come to some different understanding or agreement; for, as was said by Chief Justice Marshall in The Exchange 7 Cranch, 144 : 'It would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction and the Government to degradation, if such merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country.' [United States v. Diekelman 92, US 520 • 1 Phillim., 4 Int. Law 5 (3rd Ed.) 483, section 351; Twiss, ' Law Nat '' 229^ section 159; Creasy, 'Int. Law/ 167, section 176; Halleck, ' Int. Law' (1st Ed.), 171.] And the English Judges have uniformly recognised the rights of the Courts of the country of which the port is part to punish crimes committed by one foreigner on another in a foreign merchant-ship. (Lieg, v. Cunningham Beil,'Cr Cas.,'72; S.C. 8, Cox, 'Or. Cas./ 104; P^g. ^ Anderson. 11, Co^ 'Cr. Cas., 198, 204; S C.L.R. 1, ' Cr. Gas./ 161,165 ; Reg. Keyn, 13 Cox * Cr. Gas.,' 403, 486, 526; S.C. 2, Exch. Div., 63,161,213.) As the owner has voluntarily taken his vessel, for his own private purposes, to a place within the dominion of a Government other than his own, and from which he seeks protection during his stay, he owes that Government such allegiance for the time being, as is due for the protection to which he becomes entitled. 'Erom experience, however, it was found long ago that it would be bene ficial to commerce if the local Government would abstain from interfering with the internal discipline of the ship, and the general regulation of the rights and duties of the officers and crew towards the vessel, or among themselves. And so by comity it came to be generally understood among civilized nations that all matters of discipline, and all things done on board, which affected onlv the vessel, or those belonging to her, and did not involve the peace or dignitv of the country, or the tranquillity of the port, should be left by the local Govern ment to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged as the laws of that nation, or the interests of its commerce, should require. But if crimes are committed on board of a character to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country to which the vessel has been brought the offenders have never, by comity or usage, been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws for their punishment, if the local tribunals see fit to assert their authority. Such being the general public law on this subiect Treaties and Conventions have been entered into by nations having commercial intercourse, the purpose of which was to settle and define the rights and duties of the Contracting Parties with respect to each other in these particulars and thus prevent the inconvenience that might arise from attempts to exercise conflicting jurisdictions.' 3600050 I &gt; ^ APPENDIX 6. Document E elatinq to the C ase op S alim- Bin-S eif. No. 1. Sir J. Hardinge to the Marquess of Salisbury. (Extract.) Zanzihar^une ITthy 1898. I have the honour to transmit herewith correspondence respecting the case of Salim-bin-Seif, a Pemba slave-trader, who after long baffling the vigilance of the authorities, has at last been caught in the act of shipping slaves from that island by Captain Goldie-Taubman's police, whom the French consulate claims to protect. This Salim is the man referred to in my despatch No. 166 of the 6th instant. I should explain that the main correspondence was carried on by the French Consul with the Brigadier-General Raikes, and that it was only on fail ing to obtain satisfaction from the latter that he applied to me. Since my note to him of the 10th instant he has not again addressed me on the subject. Your Lordship will be able to judge from the inclosed papers of the vali dity of grounds on which Mr. Laronce tries to show that Salim-bin-Seif was entitled to exterritorial immunities as a 'Prench-protected person.' It is suffi cient to say that in previous cases of a similar nature, such as those of Sheikh Abdullah, of Patta, Abdullah-bin-Selam, and others, these reasons have been dismissed by your Lordship as insufficient, and the claimant summarily dealt with as local subjects. The present case has, however, excited considerable interest among the Pemba Arabs, and our success in stamping out the export Slave Trade from Pemba will be greatly affected by its solution. No reply having been received up to date from M. Laronce, the Court, ? 0 composed of General Raikes and the Arab Cadi, Sheikh Burhan-bin-Abdul Aziz, pronounced judgment on the prisoner this morning. An English trans lation of this judgment is enclosed herewith. I have told General Raikes to send a copy of the judgment to M. Laronce, and to inform him at the same time that the French flags and papers found on the convict's dhows will be duly returned to the French Consulate. ¥ 11 &gt; Inclosure 1 in No. 1. M.

I have just had a conversation as to this matter with General Eaikes. You are aware that a difference of opinion has for a long time past existed between our two Governments respecting the question of the conditions which justify the registration as French proteges of persons who could not claim that character in virtue of their origin, or of the text of the treaties. The correspon dence which has passed between Her Majesty's Agency and your predecessors on the cases (to cite only a few) of Sheikh Abdulla, of Salim-bin-Abderahman, and of Salim-bin-Ali El Eiani, indicates clearly enough the principles on which our view of this question rests, and I am therefore unable to admit that the mere fact of Salim-bin-Seifs being entered on your registers, or of the presence on board his dhows of a French flag, is sufficient of ilself to withdraw him from the jurisdiction to which he naturally belongs. I have accordingly recommended General Eaikes, before taking any further step, to inquire from you as to the date and place at which the prisoners was registered, the authority which granted, and the grounds which led to, his registration. Should these particulars establish the right of Salim-bin-Seif to French protection. I will request the local Government to surrender him to you to be tried before your Court. So far his examination has elicited no reason which would warrant such a measure, for although he states that he was born (of an Arab father) in the Comoro Islands he left, on his own showing, that territory nearly fifty years ago, and therefore at a period long anterior to the establishment of the French protectorate.

Zanzibar, June 12, 1898. Sir, I am in receipt of your despatch dated the 11th June, and I acknowledge, % with many thanks, your reasons for claiming Salim-bin-Seif as a French protege; but as regards his being born in Comoro, he himself says he was ; but I have heard from other Pemba Arabs that he was born in Pemba. But this matters little, as at the time of his birth, which he says was about forty-five years ago, the French had not annexed the island, and therefore it can make very little material difference. As regards his having bought the dhow ' Selamti ' at Mayotte and himself being registered there, it seems a mistake, as he himself says the ' Selamti'' never belonged to him, but to Salim-bin-Ali, and that he was captain or sailor in her for four years ; but as to that being true, it would hardly make Salim-bin-Seif a French protege, as, I believe, it has been decided in London before, that buying a house in Comoro does not allow the buyer to claim French protection, therefore, I suppose, likewise a dhow, also before the time of annexation ; but this is immaterial, as Salim-bin-Seif says he never did own the ' Selamti. 5 ' I have referred your letters to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, and he concurs with me that as yet there are no grounds for handing Salim-bin- Seif over to your Court. As regards the case of the ' Majunga ' last year, I beliove it was not liberated on account of nationality, but as Mr. Farler could not clearly prove his case as to the shipment of slaves, the matter was allowed to drop and the dhow liberated, and I don't think Salim was produced in your Court for slave- dealing, the case not being continued with ; therefore I do not think Sir Lloyd Mathews had any correspondence as regards the nationality of Salim-bin-Seif. I have no wish to keep Salim-bin-Seif after you have fully satisfied myself and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General with regard to his notionality to our satisfaction. I have, etc., (Sd.) A. E. BAJKES, Acting Frime Minister. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Judgment on Salim-bin-Seif. salim -BIN-SEIF,—You have claimed French protection, but as you have not proved yourself such to my satisfaction, about which I will give my reasons later, I have proceeded with the case of slave-dealing against you, and am now going to pronounce judgment. The evidence of all the slaves (seven) you have heard, and also of Nahotha Bakari and the two Askaris, and also of Nasoro-bin-Ali. Their evidence all more or less coincides. They (the slaves) say they were caught by Mwambieni and Mwabruki, acting Nahotha for you, taken to the beach at Kinzu, and shipped in a small dhow and taken and landed at Ndunne in a ' dug-out ' with Mwambieni, where they met you, and were taken into some mangroves by you; later they saw Nahotha Bakari, who told them they were going to be shipped, and had better run away. Then they say Askaris came and caught them, and that you were there ; that the Askaris pointed their rifles at you, and yo u 41 C419FPsaid, ' Don't shoot me, I am Salim,' and then you went away. Some of the slaves say they know you well. Then the evidence of the Askaris is that they were sent for, as some slaves were going to be shipped ; they, and also a witness named Athman, hid in the bushes, saw and heard you hail a ' dug-out,' and the men in the ' dug-out' hailed back ; youthen beckoned to the slaves to follow you, when they (the Askaris) jumped at and caught the slaves. Pointing their rifles at you, you said, &lt;£ Don't shoot me, I am Salim.' Their reason for not arresting you was, that they both knew you well, and could catch you any time, and had plenty of witnesses, and were doubtful whether they had the right, owing to having heard in the island that you were a French protege ; also, they all have recognized the dhow as yours. « Nasoro-bin-Ali's evidence, as to your former character, was, he said, that many people—in fact, every one in Pemba—knew you as a slave-d.ealer ; Nahotha Bakari also says he heard you bargaining as to a number of slaves with Nosoro-bin-Rashid. Therefore, on this evidence, which you have heard. Sheikh Barhan, Government Kathi, and myself, have gone into it, and have found you guilty of slave dealing, in that you have been caught in the act of trying to ship slaves, and none of them belonging to you ; therefore we sentence you to one year's rigorous im prisonment. Now, as regards your being a French protege, you say you were born in Comoro about forty-five years ago, that you have no property there and never had, your reason for being a French protege is, you say, because you have dhows carrying the French flag, wl^ich you say were registered here, one three years ago, and the other last year ; and after leaving Salim-bin-Ali's service you bought dhows which you got registered here under the French flag, about five or six years ago. Before that you were, as you say. His Highness' subject, except when you were a captain of a dhow named ' Sclamti,' which belonged to Salim-bin-Ali, a supposed French protege, as far as you know; and you say that if, when you were captain of the ' Selamti,' you had left her, you would be His Highness' subject, only having protection for the time of serving, 'When arguing the right of your French protection with the French Consul here he seemed to base his argument on the idea that the ' Selamti' was owned by you; but you yourself say you never owned it; therefore, he was Under a misapprehension; and as to your being born in Comoro, that is immaterial, as you were born there forty-five years ago and never since possessed property there or resided there, and you say yourself you are a Muscat Arab, but have lived all your life in Pemba, and many Pemba Arabs say you were born there, as far as they^have heard. I think from this you will clearly see that you are under a misappre hension as to your protecting Power, and also that it was a mistake of the French Consul to give you the French flag for your dhows. And as I have not been satisfied with your explanation or that of the French Consul as to your being a French protege, I must send you to prison to carry out the sentence passed on you.

Hon ch'er Sir Thomas Sanderson, Voici le sens de la communication de mon Gouvemement dont nous avona parle tout a I'heure 42M. Geoffray, in claiming tlie surrender of this person to the Trench Consul at Zanzibar, lays stress upon the fact that the papers originally handed to him a? Mayotte were registered at the French Consulate at Zanzibar as long ago as 1889, and that since that date Salim has made repeated voyages to Madagascar and elsewhere in vessels owned by him and ostensibly under the protection ot the French flag. Her Majesty's Government cannot, however, admit that the French Con sul, by merely registering a subject of Zanzibar as a French-protected person, is able to withdraw hiTn from the jurisdiction of the Tribunals of his natural Sovereign; nor can they assent to the view that he ought to be considered as having been so withdrawn simply because he sailed in vessels which were • permitted by the French authorities, though with what justification does not at present appear, to fly the French flag. There is nothing, indeed, to show that Salim ever had the Sultan of Zanzibar's permission to register either him- self or the ships as being under French iprotection. M. Geoffray further adduces the conduct of the Zanzibar authorities on the occasion of the arrest by M|r. Farler last year of Salim's dhow as a proof that the man's personal status is now beyond controversy. I have, however, to observe, that on that occasion the question was not whether Salim was a French-protected person, but whether there were sufficiently serious reasons for suspecting him to be engaged in the Slave iradeto justify his arrest and that of the vessel. The Zanzibar Government decided that there was not sufficient evidence to authorize such a measure, and the dhow was accordingly set at liberty. In the case under discussion, however, the proofs were enough to caus^ Salim to be arrested, and it then became necessary to enter upon the question o 1 jurisdiction. 1 inclose a copy of the judgment pronounced in the case. Tour Excellency will perceive that Salim-bin-Seif declare that he was a subject of the Sultan except during the period when he was in command of a dhow belonging to a man alleged to a French-protected person. But the fact of Salim having taken such service could not even temporarily divert elsewhere the allegiance which he owed to the Sultan of Zanzibar. Her Majesty's Government therefore remain of opinion that Salim is a subject of Zanzibar, and are unable to find anything in the facts alleged which in any degree cancels his allegiance to the Government of that country. I have, etc., (Signed) SALISBURY. No . 5. The Marquess of Salisbury to Sir A. Bardinge. Foreign Office, December 14th, 1898. The attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called by several cases which have occurred during recent years to the serious inconvenience occasioned to the Administration of the Sultanate of Zanzibar by the grant of French protection to natives who do not appear to be entitled to it, either by the Treaty between France and Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, which regulates the relations of France to Zanzibar, or by the other Treaties with Zanzibar, to the benefit of which France is entitled under the operation of the most -favoured-nation clause in her own Treaty. The Treaty between France and Muscat contains the following Articles :— 'Article III. Les Fran9ais auront la faculte d'acheter, de vendre, ou de prendre a bail des terres, maisons, magasins, dans les Etats de Son Altesse le 44Sultan de Mascate. Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins, et autres proprietes, possedes ou accupes par des Pra^ais ou par des personnes au service des Prar^ais, ni les visiter sans le con sent ement de I'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de Prance. ' Les Prangais ne pourront, sous aucun pretexte, etre retenus contre leur yolonte dans les Etats du Sultan de Mascate. ' Article IV. Les sujets de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate qui seraient au service des Eran9ais jouiront de la meme protection que les Prar^ais eux- memes ; maissiles sujets de Son Altesse sont convaincus de quelque crime ou infraction punissable par la loi, siils seront congedies par les Fra^ais au service desquels ils se trouvent, et livres aux autorites locales/' It thus appears that the only native persons who can, in virtue of the provisions of the Treaty regulating the relations between Prance and Zanzibar, claim Prench protection or fly the French flag on their dhows are 1. Natives of Prench Protectorates, who were there resident, or, least, were not resident in Zanzibar when the said Protectorates were established; and 2. The bond fide servants of Prench citizens and proteges; the local authority to be judge of what constitutes bond fide service. The Treaty excludes, therefore, from Prench protection all persons not horn in Prench possessions or dependencies, though they may have acquired land there and have been inscribed on the Prench Consular Register at Zanzibar or Muscat. The officers of the Administration of the Sultanate have therefore a right to decline to recognize exterritorial privileges to native vessels flvinff the Prench flag until satisfied that the owner is a 6wa fide citizen or protect of Prance. It would not be necessary, in order to act on this principle, to board or search the vessel under the Prench flag, but in any case in which the Administration had reason to believe that the flag was being improperly hoisted the master, when he came on shore, would be called upon to produce his papers,'and prove that he was a Prench protege in the sense which I have indicated in this despatch. If he refused to produce his papers, he would be arrested. In such matters, it would be proper for the officers of the Adminis tration to be'guided by the principles of the Ottoman Nationality Law, which has been accepted in Turkey by the foreign Powers, and may, therefore, be assumed to contain nothing contrary to the due exercise of the privileges of exterritoriality. Under that law, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject until he has proved that he is not one according to the law in question, the onus probandi lying, not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privileges of exemption from its jurisdiction. It will be observed in reference to the Prench Treaty with Muscat (and indeed with reference to the Zanzibar Treaties generally) that it speaks onlv'of French citizens or persons in the service of French citizens; the Administration of the Sultanate may therefore refuse, as the Porte has always done to recognize Tunisians and natives of Comoro as entitled to the benefits of the Treatv AH the more may those benefits be refused to persons who are not even natives of French Protectorates, not withstanding that they may at one time or other have been improperly allowed the of French proteges. I authorize you to act, in any cases that miy arise in the future, on the principles indicated in my present despatch. I am, etc..

The Marquess of Salisbury to Mr. Herbert. Sir, Foreign Officcy September 11th, 1899. Before the Sultanate of Zanzibar came under the Protectorate of Her Majesty in 1890 the protection by foreign Powers of individuals living in His Highness' dominions was exercised without reference to any very strict code of rules. To this state of things must no doubt be attributed the relatively large number of cases in which, since the establishment of the British Protec torate, particular persons have received or have claimed the protection of European Powers in circumstances which did not appear to Her Majesty's Government to warrant the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's juris diction. Many of these cases have formed the subject of correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and foreign Governments and between their Representatives in Zanzibar. Some cases have been settled by compromise, and not always in accordance with the strict interpretation of the rules which should have governed them; others are still pending or have settled themselves by efflux of time. It is necessary, however, that the protection of individuals by foreign Powers should be strictly limited to those cases where it can be undoubtedly justified by the Treaties existing between Zanzibar and the foreign Powers concerned. Her Majesty's Government, after giving careful consideration to the question, have instructed Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar, as to the rules and principles which must in future guide the Sultan's Govern ment in deciding whether, in any given case, the right of foreign protection is properly exercised. So many of the cases forming the subject of corre spondence have concerned the French Consulate, that I think it right to inform the French Government of the circumstances which have led to the above-mentioned instructions being sent to Zanzibar, and of the nature of the instructions themselves. As regards France, the attention of Her Majesty's Agent and Consul- General has in the first place been drawn to the serious inconvenience occa sioned to the Saltan's Administration by the grant of French protection to natives who do not appear to be entitled to it, either by the French Treaty with Maskat of the 17th November, 1844, or by the other Treaties with Zanzibar, to the benefit of which France is entitled under the operation of the most-favoured nation clause in our own Treaty. The Treaty between France and Maskat contains the following Articles :— tc ARTICLE III. &lt;e Les Fran9ais auront la faculte d'acheter, de vendre ou de prendre a bail des terres, maisons, magasins, dans les Etats de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate Nul de pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasions, et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes par des Fran9ais ou par des personnes au service de Fran9ais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Toccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de France.48 ' Les Prangais ne ponrront, sous aucun pretexte, ^tre retenus contre leur volonte dans les Etats du Sultan de Mascate. ' ARTICLE IV. 'Les sujets de Son Altesse le Sultan de Macate qui seraientau service des Erancais jouiront de la m^rae protection que les Era^ais eux-memes; mais si les sujets de Son Altesse sont convaincus de quel que crime ou infraction punissable par la loi, ils seront congedies paries Eranyais au service desquels ils se trouvent, et livres aux autorites locales.' The Treaty in its terms applies only to Erenchmen (' Era^ais') and their servants. By usage the benefit of its provisions has been extended to natives of Erench Protectorates. But it is to be observed that subjects of Zanzibar cannot be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Sultan's Courts without his consent, and the mere recognition by the Erench authorities that such persons are subjects of Erench Protectorates is for this purpose quite inoperative. Moreover, such persons, in order to be entitled to the benefit of the Treaty, must be in fact bond fide subjects of Erench Protectorates, and the circum stance that they have been inscribed on the Eench Consular Register at Zanzi bar or Maskat cannot be regarded as sufficient for this purpose. The officers of the Administration of the Sultanate have, therefore, a right to decline to recognize ex-territorial privileges to native vessels flying the Erench flag until satisfied that the owner is a bond fide citizen or protege of Erance (' Eran- Qais'). In such matters it would be proper fur the officers of the Administration to be guided by principles similar to those of the Ottoman Nationality Law, which has been accepted in Turkey by the Eoreign Powers, and may, therefore, be assumed to contain nothing contrary to the due exercise of the privileges, of ex -territoriality. The onus prohandi lies, not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction ; and any person claiming exemption must establish his right to such exemption by sufficient evidence. The benefits of the Zanzibar Treaties cannot be extended to persons who are not hand fide natives of French Protectorates, notwithstanding that they may at one or other have been allowed the status of Erench proteges without a sufficiently careful consideration of their right to that status.

I regret that I am unable to comply with your Lordship's instructions by this mail, as Salim is at present in Pemba, and some of M. Combon's statements cannot be verified without a reference to the person most directly interested. Salim was released from prison on the 16th June last, and at once applied for and obtained employment under the Zanzibar Government. He still maintains that he is a subject of His Highness the Sultan, and it is hardly probable, unless considerable outside pressure is brought to bear upon him, that he^ will risk the loss of his present occupation on the very slender chance of obtaining compen sation for wrongful imprisonment. 1 have, etc., (Signed) BASIL S.

Mv statement that Salim had obtained Government employment is incorrect; it was founded on information supplied to me by Sir Lloyd Mathews, but it is now evident that there was a misunderstanding, either on his part or on mine, as to what had actually taken place. Erom the evidence that Mr. Sinclair has been able to obtain, in one case from an eye-witaess, there appears to be little doubt that Salim was actually bom in the Island of Pemba and this fact, unless it can be disproved, will finally dispose of his claims to Erench protection., I have, etc., (Signed) BASIL S. CAVE.Inclosure 1 in No. 11. r Vice-Consul Sinclair to Mr, Cave. S ir, ChaJci-ChaHi JPemha, October 25, 1899. I have the honour to submit the following report with reference to the case of Salim-bin-Seif, which, in accordance with your verbal instructions, I have made the subject of special inquiry :— Your information that he is now in Government employ is without found ation, and Captain Taubmann, whom I consulted, and who gave me very great assistance in collecting evidence as to his parentage, was of opinion that it would be unwise to interview Salim (or Msellim, as his correct name seems to be), as he is known to be still antagonistic to the Government, and it might lead him to attach importance to his case. Inquiries, however, which I made at 'Weti leave little room for doubt that he was not, as he stated, born at Comoro, but here in Pemba. An M'Pemba, named Hamis-bin-Taid, whose evidence I first obtained, stated that he had known Msellim-bin-Seif all his life, having been brought up in the same village with him; his mother, who died about three years ago, was, he said, a Pemba woman, named Binti Ali, the daughter of Ali-bin-Suliman, of Kinyazini—a place just south of Weti. She married a Maskat Arab named Saif who settled at Pemba, and this witness is willing to swear that Binti Ali never left Pemba, and that Msellim was born there. An old Arab named Abdulla-bin-Salim-bin- Abdulla of Kwimone confirmed the above evidence, and added that he remem bered the marriage taking place here. I inclose his written statement that Msellim was born in Pemba. This witness, on being asked if he had ever heard that Msellim possessed property elsewhere, said that he had heard that Saif Msellim's father, Gazija (Comoro) who possessed property there. The most direct and convincing proof as to Msellim's birthplace is, how ever, that furnished by Selimah-binti-Juma-bin-Suliman, who was examined by one of the native officers. Captain Simba ; this woman is a cousin of Msellim's mother, whose name she says was Bisharah-binti-Ali-bin-Suliman, who was born at Pemba, her mother being a native Pemba girl; Selimah states that she was actually present at the birth of Msellim-bin-Saif, which took place at Chavani, and that he had one brother, who died in infancy, and a sister whose mother was a Suria named Faida. Another witness, Khamis-bin-Saif, declared that there was a third son named Mahomed-bin-Saif by a wife from Gazija (Comoro). In view of this evidence, which is amply confirmed by others, there can be little doubt that Msellim-bin-Saif only assumed false nationality, and sa obtained Erench protection in order to more safely carry on his well known malpractices in slave*trading, to which their flag has unfortunately acquired the undesirable reputation of affording an effective screen in these waters—a reputation which his punishment has, so I am informed, done much among the natives of this island to eradicate. * I have, etc., (Signed) JOHN H.

Argument on behalf of the Government of His Britannic Majesty. PREFACE. The Tribunal is now in possession of the Cases and Counter-Cases contain ing the statements of the Parties to the present controversy, and of the facts and documents upon which the Parties base their respective contentions. The object of the present Argument will be to lay before the Tribunal, as briefly as is consistent with clearness, what in the view of His Majesty's Govern ment are the proper conclusions to the drawn, with respect to the matter included in the ' Compromis,' from the statements and documents submitted, and to indicate the irrelevancy, for the solution of the questions in controversy, of a very great portion of the contents of the French ' Memoire ' and ' Contre- Memoire.' 8 rll C YIt is to be observed at the outset that France, by adopting the role of defendant in a case in which she is claiming immunity and exceptional treat ment for Arabs in the dominions of their natural Sovereign, has reserved for the Contre-Memoire ' a great part of her own affirmative case, and that the ' ' Contre-Memoire,' like the ' Memoire,' is very largely taken up by state ments with reference to Great Britain which have nothing to do with the points in dispute, and serve only to distract the attention of the Arbitrators from the points really at issue. It appears to His Majesty's Government that the relevant matters of fact involved in the Case fall within a very small compass, and that for the solution of question mainly, if not solely, of a juridical character, it is unnecessary and improper to enter into speculations or to make allegations as to the diplomatic action or political situation of either of the two Governments concerned. His Majesty's Government submit that France does not assist her case by the manner in which motives are imputed to Great Britain or to the British authorities in India (' Contre-Memoire,' , p. 51). His Majesty's Government do not propose to recriminate by any inquiry into the policy of France With respect to the coast of Arabia, and are content to examine the acts and claims of France with respect to the Treaty of 1844, the Declaration of 1862,. and the Brussels Act of 1890, by reference to the conventional rights and duties rising frdm these documents and to the rules of international law. They will confine themselves to the task of laying before the Tribunal what would appear, according to international law and the terms of those documents, to be the due apprecia tion of the correctness and effect of these claims. It is stated in the Preface to the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 1) that the French ' Memoire'— ' a demontre enfin que la France n'a jamais cesse dans ses rapports avec Tim ana t d'observer 1'esprit, comme la lattre, de la Declaration du 10 Mars, 1862. Cette derniere question est en realite la seule qui devait etre soumise au present arbitrage.' It has already been pointed out in the British Counter-Case (p. 2) that the ' Compromis ' submits to the Tribunal no such general question as above stated. On perusal of the terms of ntis ase, p. . the 'Compromis' and of M. Cambon's letter printed at p. 80 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' it will be clearly seen that no general inquiry is intended as to whether Great Britain or France have respected the mutual Declaration of 1862, but a particular inquiry as to whether the grant by France of her fhig to subjects of the Sultan is consistent with the Declaration, and a necessary incident of such inquiry, to ascertain what immunities France claims to attich, within the Sultanate of Muscat, to the possession of the French flag by the Sultan's subjects. In view of the too frequent digressions from the true issue in the French ' Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' His Majesty's Government cannot refrain from pressing urgently on the Tribunal the true nature of the issues submitted and the desirability of confining the arguments and conclusions to these issues. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. . Before passing to the facts and arguments, it is unfortunately again neces sary to dispose of certain preliminary allegations which appear to impugn the good faith of Great Britain. The Contre-Memoire ' (pp. 3 to 7) deals with the question of the appearance of the name of His Highness the Sultan as a party to the British Case. In the British Counter Case (p. 1) Great Britain has in deference to French wishes, deleted the Sultan's name as a party. But it has been pointed out, in the Counter-Case (p, 1) and in the correspondence (printed at pp. 39, 40 and 41 of the Counter-Case) that the French objection is purely technical, and10 that His Highness has, iu fact, invoked the good offices of Great Britain. The position assumed by GreatjBritain, and objected to by France, is not that of legal guardian of the Sultan, but of a friendly Power selected and requested to lay before the Tribunal the Sultan's experience of the effect on his authority of the action of France with respect to his subjects. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of these documents, the Tribunal will be satisfied of the correctness of the attitude assumed by Great Britain, and that the statement made on p. 4 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' as to the tardiness of the Sultan's assent is erroneous, and that his assent was given so far back as 1903- Whether the Saltan is or is not formally a party to the arbitration, it is essential for the Triburfal to determine the extent to which France is entitled to confer immunity on the Sultan's subjects frpm the jurisdiction of their natural Sover eign within his own territory. It is suggested in the French ' Contre-Memoire ' that the British Case is, both in substance and in form, incompati-: • Contre-Memoire , p. 3. ]ji e w ith the Declaration of 1862. It is difficult to see how such a contention can seriously be advanced. To admit its accuracy would be to read the Declaration as precluding Great Britain from ever questioning the propriety of any act done by France as to Oman. If the Sultan happens to agree with one of the two Parties to the Declaration of 1862 that the other is attacking his independence, is it to be said that to support the Sultan in his opinion is to violate his independence ? If, finding that his jurisdiction over his subjects is impaired by the action of one of the two Powers, he consults the other, is the giving of advice on such consultation a breach of his independence ? May he only consult the country against which he feels that he has ground for complaint ? In the same breath France objects that the Sultan's protests were due to British influence, and that the Sultan has locus standi to m ike any objection at all as to acts affecting his authority over his own subjects. France suggests, and makes it a ground of complaint, that he Sultan would not have objected to the protection of his subjects by France but for the inter vention of iireat Britain. But if the effect of this action of France is what Great Britain contends before the Tribunal, Great Britain had an undoubted right to complain to France of the breach of the Declaration of 1862, and it is difficult to see how France, after consenting to refer the mattfer of substance, should take refuse in points of form calculated to have no effect except to retard or prevent the decision of the points of substance. Further, if Great Britain is entitled, by virtue of the Declaration of 1862, to complain of infraction of the Sultan's independence, the Sultan is equally entitled, as an independent Sovereign, to complain, even apart from that Declaration, of interference by France with his jurisdiction over his own sub- e _ . . iects. The contention that the Declara- ' Confrc*Memcirfl p.6. tion of 1862 is as to the Saltan alios acta, and that he had never been asked to adhere to this Declaration, may be met at once by pointing out that an attack on the Sultan's independence is iioires inter alios acta Q\i\\ev for the Sultan or for the other party to the Declaration of 18^2, and a significant commentary on the French Declarations is to be found in the letter of M. Ottavi of the 2nd January, 1895, in which he says :— ' Hqureusement, Seyyid Feysal, devant I'absence d'une note ecrite, qu'il *' CoEtre M.mMre,' p. 201. d«BUWd&lt;* aUX Angkig pOOT 861 couvnr, n aura it guere ose interveni d'une mani^re officace, et se serait borne a faire dresser chaque annee la liste de nos bputriers.' And the undated and unsigned letter, printed at p. 290 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' which is not on record in the British Consular archives, if authentic and correctly translated, also indicates that the Sultan thought ii, dangerous to remonstrate with France.11 Of Course, without the support of one of the Parties to the Declaration, the Sultan was not in a position to resist infractions of his independence by the other J he same observations apply as to the rights of Prance in case of any appearance of attack by Great Britain on the Sultan's independence. His Majesty's Government must demur to the accuracy of the statement (at p 4 of the Contre-Meqloire , '), that Great Britain has concerned herself ' Contre-Memoi^,' p. 4. more with the relations which exist, or should exist, between the French Hepublic and the Sultan of Muscat than with the question submitted to the Tribunal. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of the British Case and Counter-Case, the Tribunal will be satisfied that Great Britain has confined herself to the statement of the facts with relation to Erench protection of Omani vessels, and its effect on the jurisdiction and independence of the Sultan, whereas the French Case and Counter-Case are concerned largely, if not mainly, with imputations on the policy and motives of Great Britain, and with matters foreign to the only material question in controversy. His Majesty's Government, therefore, while not contending that the Sultan should be separately represented before the Tribunal, submit with confidence that for the due determination of the Case it is necessary to hear and consider what has passed between the Sultan and France with respect to French claims of protection. In the French t&lt; Contre-Memoire ' (p 7) the reasons for the reference by Great Britain to the Franco-Muscat Treaty of 1844 are misunderstood. By reason of the most favoured-nation clause in the Treaty of 1844 and the Anglo- Muscat Treaty of 1891, it is necessary for the European Parties to each Treaty to refer to the other Treaty in order to ascertain the full extent of the privileges conferred by it, since both Great Britain and France are entitled to the most favoured-nation treatment. Consequently the Treaty of 1844/though techni cally res inter alios acta, is, by the effect of the clause in question, made material and relevant for the elucidation of the present controversy, and shpws that the two Parties to the Declaration of 1802 stand on an equal footing as to exterritoriality in Oman. But it is also essentially material as being, apart from any question of sub sequently developed usnge, the conventional measure of French rights and privi leges in Oman, which is a fact, recognized by France in the contentions based on its terms (' Contre-Memoire,' p. '69) ; g,nd it is difficult to understand the sug gestion made at page 7 of the 'Contre-Memoire,' that the mere fact of referring to this Treaty or discussing its terms gives an impression that His Majesty's Government claim to exercise a virtual protectorate, and constitutes a fresh attack on the Declaration of 1882. In approaching a juridical or quasi-juridical question, it is usual to lay before the Tribunal the material which may assist towards its solution. And in dealing with the position of Great Britain and France in Muscat, it is surely not irrelevant to point out the extent to which, at the time of trie Declaration of 1862, France had extra-territorial jurisdiction in Oman, and that by the new Treaty of 1891, replacing the older Treaty of ] 839, Great Britain acquires no extra, territorial rights which do not equally and automatically accrue in favour of France. Comment is made as to the propriety of the inclusion in the British Case (p. 73) of a statement unofficially communicated by M. Camhon to LordLans- downe on the 14th August, 1901. This statement seems to have been a summary t( „ t _ . „ 00 00 of information received from French officials ' Contre-M^moire.' pp 82-83. i tt- n/i • * ' * and His Majesty s Government, with a view to elucidate the questions raised therein, obtained from British officials, and communicated to the French Government, the information and observations contained in the documents printed at pp. 75—78 of the British Case.

Cambon's statem en as essential to the proper understanding of the British documents and reports which follow it, but do not of course claim that it in any way restricts the free dom of Prance in the arbitration to rest her case upon a different basis. The British Memorandum was referred to the French Consul at Muscat for ( „ 0*0 oe* bis observations, and they are included in ' Contre-M&amp;noire/' pp 252—255. • -n i ct i-i j- 'AT' • the Prench ' Contre-Memoire. THE SULTAN'S NOTIPICATIONS. At p 10 of the French u Contre-Memoire' , a suggestion is made that the translation in the Britisli Case (p. 69) of the Sultan's notification to his sub- , &lt;ri , -. / . „ 0 , iects of the 15th June, 1900, is seriously ' Contre-M^moire,' p. 84.

The British translation (except as to the date, which, by a clerical error, was given as 14 Safar instead of 16 Safarj is an accurate rendering of the noti fication officially supplied to the British Consul by the Sultan, printed in the Appendix 1, p. 43. ^PP endi , X ' 'J 1 ' 011 ^ FOduCed to the • TribuoaL The word ' mm hazil loura and the final paragraph referred to, the omission of which is complained of, do not occur in this document. Tne copy supplied to the American Consulate is substantially identical in form with that supplied to the British Consulate, and, in response to inquiries by the British Consul at Muscat, His HiglmesS the Sal tan has stated that the Arabic text is a correct copy, corresponding to that which was promulgated among his subjects. The French translation of the document, as printed at p. 84 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,and a correct English translation are subjoined in parallel columns:— French Version, ' (Apresles formulas d'usage.)

' Qu'il soit bien clair pour vous que cet avis a cours k partir du 16 Safar ; les patentes au sujet des dates desquelles il y aura doute seront ex aminees d'accord avec la Puissance qui les aura delivrees. Salut!' Written on 16tli Safar, 1318. ' Let* it become clear to you that thi s notification comes into force from the 16th Safar, and as to the articles in the case, of which there is doubt in the mat ter of the date on which they were taken, there will be an investigation in to it with the Government from which they have been taken, and salaams. According to the view of His Majesty's Government, the notification, read by the light of the events which immediately preceded it, is in no sense a recognition of Hires granted prior to its issue. Immediately before the issue of the notification the Sultan had visited Siir, British Case, Appendix 23, p. 68. and had there received and accepted the British Case pp. 68-69. agreement by the Siiris to surrender all Erench flags held by them. The document by which this was carried out are printed at pp. 68 and 69 of the British Case, and it is clear from those docu ments and from the terms of the notification itself, that the Saltan treated the acceptance of the articles and flags as inconsistent with the allegiance of his subject to him. THE MASIRA INCIDENT. At the end of the Erench Counter-Case (p.69) the Masira incident is treated as if it constituted a violation by Great Britain of the Sultan's indepen dence and of the obligations created by the Declaration of 1862. This incident, consisting in the murder of the crew of a British merchant ship wrecked on the Island of Masira, was naturally of a character to call for the close attention of the British Consul. The Consul did go to the island, but the offenders were dealt with by the Sultan himself, and were executed by his men, the British Consul attending, at the Sultan's request. The British Consul held no oilicial inquiry in the island, and confined himself to making inquiries of spme of the accused, with a view to establishing the identity of the victims of the massacre THE SLAVE TRADE. It is quite true, as stated at p. 55 of the Prench ' Contre-Memoire,' , that the Slave Trade only indirectly concerns the present controversy. B ut the etfect of the Prench action as to the Brussels Act and of the Prench claims in. Oman, is to impede its complete suppression by the Signatory Powers, and also to impede the due execution of the Sultan's arrangements for the suppres sion of the trade in Muscat waters, by creating a class of native vessels which, according to the Prench claim, can be policed in these waters only by P^ench war-ships. M. Ottavi, in his letter of the 19th ' p ' 24? - June, 1895, comments on- ' cette singulifere recrudescence d'importation de n^gres qui se concen- trerait tout entiere sur le point du Sultanat de Maskat, ou nous avons le plus d'interets.' The singularity on which comment is made disappears when the facts are considered. They have already been stated, but apparently need reiteration. The part of Muscat where, according to M. Ottavi, the interests of Prance are largest, happens also to be that occupied by tribes of Arabs who have taken advantage of their geographical position from time immemorial to engage in « N ote. Consulates. .—This last paragraph docs not occur in the document as supplied by the Sultan to the British and Americaa 13the Slave Trade. M. Ottavi himself gives an instance of the importation of slaves into Siir (' Contre-Memoire,' p. 265). It has already been stated in the British Counter-Case that over 100 of these Siiris were in 1902 captured in Mozambique while engaged in shipping slaves, and this capture is referred to in M. Kiesel's report of the 13th June, on re- moire, p. / . 1902. The statement of M. Ottavi that Siiris have been offered the British flag (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 2el-267) is wholly unfounded. The Siiris do not love the British flag, because they have experience of the vigilance of British cruisers for the suppression of their slaving on the high seas and in territorial waters under the Treaty of 1873. The interest which Prance has in Siir appears to be the protection of the residents of that place who have Erench flags, and whose status is the chief matter of controversy before the Tribunal. It is unfortunate that there is a direct conflict between the reports of British naval officers and Consuls and the officers and Consuls of Prance, as to whether the French flag is used to cover the carriage of slaves into Oman or the Persian Gulf. Each Party naturally believes its own officers, and it is for the Tribunal to decide between the two in any points of divergence which are rele vant to this inquiry. The Prench reports (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 245—251) made in 1895 strongly contest the allegations of Major Sadler, the British Consul at Muscat (British Case, p. 58). But His Majesty's Government venture to submit that it will be impossible seriously to dispute the facts stated in the British Counter- Case (Appendix VII, p. 47) as to the running of slaves by one Salim-ul-Badi under Prench colours, and it is certainly indisputable that two Omani vessels under the Prench flag were captured by a British cruiser in 1896 near the coast of Oman with slaves on board, and were tried and condemned by a Prench Court. There are other instances of condemnation in the Prench ' Contre-Memoire ' 'Contre-M^moire,' pp. 65, 278, et seq. which, while they evidence the activity ''Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 272. and loyalty of Prench officials, also Appendix 6, p. 47. demonstrate that Arab slavers do cover the Slave Trade with the Prench flag; and the note of M. Kies^l indicates that at a period after 1890, when Madagascar was occupied, the Prench naval police was relaxed, and that even in 1902 only three vessels were employed to police the ocean between Africa and Arabia. His Majesty's Government would add that in 1898Ione Salim-bin-Seif was caught shipping slaves in vessels flying the Prench flag at Pemba or Zanzibar, and was claimed by M. Laronce, the French Consul, as a Prench protege, and the fact that he was tried in Zanzibar and convicted and his claim to Prench protection overruled by the Courts, led to considerable discussion between His Majesty's Govern ment and that of the Prench Bepublic. Into the merits of the controversy it is needless to enter. The important fact is that Salim was in 1898 running slaves under the Prench flag, and was stated by Prance to be of Siiri descent. There is clearly a great desire to get Arab vessels under the French flag. It is stated in the Prench Counter-Case, p. 14, that if all applications made had been granted, there would be hundreds of Omani vessels under the Prench flag, and that but for strict administration many more flags would be granted in French Somaliland (p. 107). The statement at p. 60 of the ' Contre-Memoire ' that the International Bureau at Zanzibar has often had to register slave trading by vessels belonging to Arab proteges of Great Britain must be based on some mistake. Examina tion of the Reports of the Bureau discloses only one case of slave-running under the British flag. The vessel in question was captured by a British cruiser, and the number and activity of the British public vessels employed to prevent slave-running make it very dangerous to attempt to carry on the trade under the British flag. It is to be noted that the Report of the International Bureau for 1899 states that there had been during the year a real recrudescence of attempts to carry on the Slave Trade with the object of meeting the demand for slaves 1400065 A i « in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and that in 1900 the Slave Trade was still going on (State Papers, vol. xciv, p. 754). In each of these years a Trench vessel had been seized with slaves on board. It is attempted to discredit the evidence adduced in support of the British allegations that slave trading still continues from Africa and Arabia to the • Persian Gulf, and that the French flag is used at times to cover it. The two Governments naturally rely in the main on the reports which they receive from their officials. The French contention seems to be that no African or Indian in British service is to be believed in any statement which he makes, and that British sailors are induced by desire for the bounties (described in the ' Contre- ' Contre-Memoire,' p. 57. Memoire' as prizemoney) to make •' Contre-M^naoire,' p. 135. imaginative reports. These bounties, be it said, are only awarded after judicial condemnation for slave trading, and inconsiderate or irregular seizure brings reprimand, and not reward. (See 'The Slave Trade Act, 1873,' 36 and 37 Vict., cap. 88, sections 11—16.) It is inevitable that in African and Asiatic waters and territories some resort must be made to the evidence of natives; but even allowing a reasonable discount for Oriental inaccuracy. His Majesty's Government submit that the statements on the subject of slave dealing made by Orientals contained in the British Case must carry considerable weight more especially when all that France has to oppose to them is the statements of other Orientals, the Arabs in question, who have a far more direct interest, to deny, than the British witnesses have to affirm, the facts in controversy. Great Britain is justified in drawing attention to the international incon venience caused to the Signatories of the Brussels Act by the refusal of France to ratify Article XLII, and it would seem that the French Commanders of war ships engaged in suppressing the Slave Trade have found it necessary to point 4 -4 this out to their Government. M. Martel, ' Contre-M^uioire,' p. 89. Coratnander of the ' Drome,' in his &gt; ^ report of the 10th December, 1900, says that the refusal to accept the provisions of Article XLII makes it necessary to insist on the importance of enforcing } \ Article XXXIV of the Act as to having the name of the vessel cut in Latin characters on the stern, and the marking of the sail with the letter of the ' port d'attache/' and the register number of the vessel. It has been pointed out in the British Case (p. 17) that the dhows which were at siir at the date of the Sultan's visit in June 1900 had not com- ' Contre-Memoire,' p. 250- ^ ^ ^ X XXIV. M. Chautemps, Minister of the Colonies, says, in his letter of the 9th July, 1*95 ' II n'est pas impossible, neanmoins, que des boutres de contrebande arborent illegalement notre pavilion pour se livrer a la traite ayec plus da facilite,' And Commander Kiesel, in his note of ' coDtre-M&amp;noire,' P . 272. ^ 13tll j UIie} X902, in speaking of the y Mozambique coast, says:— i f J « Sur cette c6te, d'ailleurs, il y a lieu d'etre trfcs actif et trfcs prudent, parce que les boutres arborent le pavilion qu'ils jugent le plus avantageux a I'instant present. Comme ]e Portugal y a en permanence un croiseur et plusieurs can- onnieres, que I'Angleterre y a en permanence des batiments, le pavilion fraa- ^ais est commode, quand le croiseur frangais n'y est pas.' If Article XLII applied to vessels under the French flag, the abuse of the flag above referred to would be impossible. But the admission of M. Kiesel M ^ fully supports the statement made at p. 11 of the British Case, that Arabs who |i 4P engage in the Slave Trade are fully aware of the gap created by the non-adhesion of France in the meshes of the.net which would otherwise completely envelop their nefarious traffic, and the anxiety of France to inform all the world that the . ' droit de visite ' does not exist as to vessels flying her flag on the high seas has 4 &gt; 15not failed of its effect on those who seek to avoid the suryeillance of an interna tional police. They prefer the chance of See' Contre-Memoire,' p. 272. 1 . i • • i &lt;« it xa t an occasional visit irom the .b rench cruisers, who, until very lately, if not even now, are very few in number for the extent of sea which they have to patrol. The observations made as to the credulity of the British Consul at Muscat in 1899 in the case of Mbarak-ben-iiaroul are not justified by the documents on which they purport to be based. These ' Contre-M^moire,' pp. 62, 256. , ./ / V, , .. . ,. documents show that the native in question escaped or deserted from a dhow flying the French flag and took refuge on His Majesty's ship ' Pigeon,' stating that he was in slavery and demanding freedom, lie was taken to the British Consulate and at once sent on to the French Con sulate and placed at the disposal of the French Consul, the British Consul making no examination as to his statements, and expressing no opinion what ever-as to the truth of the man's statements or the justice of his claim, but merely sending him to the person whose business it was to verify the allegations made. THE QUESTIONS OF FACT INVOLVED. The facts relating to the present controversy are not numerous or compli cated. No attempt is made by France to deny the accuracy of the British account of the incident of the quarantine-breakers, or to suggest that any one of these men was on a vessel under the French flag when sent to quarantine, or when he escaped or when he was recaptured. Under these circumstances Consular jurisdiction over the men seems to have been claimed under the Treaty of 1844 ; at least no other ground is suggested. Nor again is any attempt made to con- p ~ tradict the substance of the British ac count of the incidents of Suweik and Debai. The former case was a claim to deal with the succession to Salim-bin- Mahommed which must have been a question of purely Mahommedan law affecting a native of Suweik. The second related to the use of the French flag by the son of the above Salim. If new papers had been given to the son after the death of the father in 1902, there would have been a breach of M. Cam- bon's undertaking of the 26th June, 1900. Since the delivery of the British Counter-Case a report has been received Appendix 3, P . 43, from Zanzibar that an Arab, who seems to be the Ali-bin-Salem (No. 17 on the revised French list), has come under suspicion of slave-trading, and has been deprived of his French papers by M. Ottavi, the French Consul at Zanzibar. The references in the French ' Contre-Memoire ' to the Debai incident (pp. 68-69) make it expedient to restate that incident in somewhat greater detail. Debai is on the Pirate Coast, and is not part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and its Chief is one of the Trucial Chiefs referred to in the British Counter-Case, p. 21. The representations made by the French Consul to the Sultan of Muscat seem to have been made in the belief that the Chief of Debai was a dependent or feudatory of the Sultan of Muscat, which is not the case. The French, Consul, also, on the 24th March, 1904, wrote direct to Appendix 2, p. 43. the Chief of I)ebai tlie ^tter of which a copy is annexed. The action of the British Consul at Muscat, with reference to the Debai case, can in no sense be construed as indicating the exercise of any protectorate over Muscat. On being consulted by the Sultan as to the French Consul's communication, the British Consul gave it as his opinion that as the man alleged to have been wronged at Debai was one of the Sultan's subjects resident at Suweik, in Oman, the claim on the Chief of Debai ought to be made by the Sultan, and not through the French Consul 16.17 The first question of fact is whether Prance has granted to subjects of the Sultan French flags and papers. The recital of the ' Compromis ' consti tutes an admission by France that France has granted French flags and papers to certain Muscat ship-owners This admission is supplemented by the inclusion in the French Meraoire y ' (p. 5S) and ' Oontre-Memoire,' p. 297 of two lists, headed ' Proprietaires de Boutres mascatais francises.' The Tribunal is not asked to decide anything except as to dhows owned by subjects of the Sultan and flying the French flag or lurnished with French papers, and as to the families of such persons, and as to the captains and crews of such vessels, and perhaps also the families of these latter persons. It is for France to show that persons falling within these categories have been lawfully trans ferred from their natural allegiance to that of France, or have lawfully been brought under French protection either before or by means of the francisation which is alleged to have taken place. His Majesty's Government have no doubt that if any such persons have, by false statements or fraudulent devices, imposed upon French officials and improperly obtained/romma^cw, the Gov ernment of the French Republic, on ascertaining the truth, would not hesitate to strip them of the privileges which have been thus improperly obtained ; and His Majesty's Government submit with confidence that they have established that the Sliris in question are originaires of Oman, and are not settlers or residents in French Colonies, but sailors whose home is in Oman, paying busi ness visits only to various ports in the Indian Ocean. If the French contention were right, it would be open to content that the French fishermen who annually, for long periods, visit Iceland or the New foundland banks, and only return home for the winter, have not their domicile in France. It is not clear whether France contests the accuracy of the statement that the Signatories to the undertaking given in June 1900 to the Sultan at Siir are natives of, and resident in, Oman. The letters of some of these men con tain -various allegations as to visits to ' M^moires,' p. 65-/0. French Colonies and having been in French service ; but these assertions made with the object of obtaining French protection cannot be accepted in the absence of corroborative evidence. It appears to be admitted by France in the recital of the £C Compromis,' and in the two lists of dhow-owners, that Omanis are in possession of French ^ ^ ^ flags and papers. .These lists have already B.itish Ccnnter Case, p. 12. ^ ^ the British Counte /. Case, and the identity of the persons specified therein to some extent ascer 1 tained. The revised list in the French «Contre-M&amp;noire, p. 2 . ' Contre-Meiuoire' differs from that in the original Case by omitting four names :~ Selim -ben-Eachid (No. 20 in first list) ; Selim-Bouheti (No. Jil „ ); Selim Mohammed Libadi (No. 23 in the first list, the man whose doings are described somewhat fully in the British Counter-Case, p. 4i7) ; and Salim -bin-Mohammed Wad Taheb (No. 27 in the first list); by ascribing to Ali-bin-Salim-bin-Bachid (No. 2) a second vessel, and by ascrib ing to Ali-bin-Salim Wad Taheb (No. 17) four vessels which in the first list were ascribed to Salim-bin-Mohammed Wad Taheb. From the Export printed in Appendix No. 3, p. 43, it would seem that the French titre and flag of one of the four vessels—the Fath-el-Kheir—has very-recently been taken away by the French Consul at Zanzibar. No details whatever are given as to the grounds on which the dhow-owners on the lists were placed there, nor where, nor why these Arabs got French papers.Instead of giving this information, it is contended that— ' la France ne saurait reconnaltre au Sultan de Mascate I'exercice d^un contrflle snr 1''octroi du pavilion tricolore dans les Colonies ' Contre-M^moire,' p. 8. franjaises ; cette pratique etant basee sur le droit interne de I'JEtat fran^ais.' This contention evades the question in dispute. It is not necessary to inquire as to the municipal law of France with respect to the grant of the French flag to ships, so long as the ships in question remain in French waters. Nor is it necessary to inquire as to the effect on the high seas or in the waters of third Powers of the French law as to the grant of the French flag. What the Tribunal has to consider is whether France can, under cbver of her munici pal law, give to subjects of another Power in the territories and waters of that Power an extra-territorial and privileged position and exemption from the laws of their natural Sovereign. According to the view of Bis Majesty's Gov ernment, the contention of France is that the municipal law as to the grant of flags is to prevail outside her own territory over international law and the municipal law of other States. And after thus disposing of the claim of the Sultan to information as to the reasons for withdrawing his subjects from his jurisdiction, it is further suggested that «contre-MSmoire, pp. . Great Britain is guilty of a petitio princi- pii in treating as settled a priori in favour of the Sultan the question of the statut 'personnel of all the dhow-owners who are originaires Oman ou sup poses telsy and who have obtained French papers, and France not only makes express reserve against the British view, but also appears to deny any obliga tion to give any written explanation of the grounds on which each litre was granted. What, according to the French view, is the efotut personnel of a Moslem Arab born and residing in Oman, who has wives in the various ports to which he takes his ship in the sailing season, and who flies the French flag ? Is his right to marry, or the transmission of his property, determined bv the ' Code Napole on ' or by the Koran ? Does he retain his statut personnel as an Omani Arab, with a right to decline the jurisdiction of the Court best competent to determine the appropriate prescriptions of the Mohammedan law ? The natural and ordinary presumption as to a person who is origin aire of a particular State is that he is the subject of the Sovereign of that State. Where he is not only an originaire, but also ordinarily resident in that Statej the presumption is strengthened. And if any State claims that a person born and ordinarily resident in another State is a subject or protege of the first State, it is in accordance with all rules of law and justice that the claiming State should furnish proof of the grounds of its claim. It is true that under* certain conditions in modern times what is termed ' double nationality ' arises. For instance, a Frenchman duly naturalized in the United States may, never theless, continue to be a French citizen if he has not satisfied his obligations under French military law or other laws. In such a case the United States, though always ready and constitutionally bound to afford the amplest protection to its citizens throughout the world, recognizes that a Frenchman naturalized in America under the conditions indicated has no claim to American protection in France. The same principle is recognized by the British Naturalization Act, 1870. When an originaire of any State is claimed as citizen or protege of another, it is juridically impossible to suppose that the Sovereign is bound to accept the mere statement of the Agents of the other power that the person claimed is its subject. In an ordinary European State such a claim would, of course, not have much effect, since the system of exterritoriality is not there recognized • but in a State in which exterritoriality or immunity from local jurisdiction is recognizedby Treaty or usage, it is essential, to prevent abuse, that the person claiming immunity from the local authorities, or the owner who claims it for him should prove that he falls within one of the categories of privileged19 persons. To hold otherwise would be to allow the claiming Power to be its own judge on controverted questions of fact and law and of the interpretation of Treaties. In this Arbitration it devolves on France to lay before the Arbitra tors the grounds on which she seeks to withdraw from the Sultan those of his subjects whose names appear on the lists already referred to, or others of his subjects who, though not on the lists, may be in consimili casu. The knowledge of the grounds for granting jrancimtion or Prench flags to such vessels 'or persons is peculiarly within the reach of France, and is not accessible to Great Britain nor to the M^moire,' p. is. Sultan of Muscat. It is stated that registers exist at Muscat of all Arab vessels which have been franches and of their owners and captains. It is known that titres are granted to their vessels. The copies of such litres which have reached His Majesty's Government indi-^ cate that if these litres are properly filled in, abundant indications will be afforded of the place where the proprietor is said to reside, where his vessel was francise and the like, although, as has been pointed out in the British Case^ pp. 16, 45-47, in certain of these litres most essential information, viz., as to the residence of the proprietors, has been omitted. France seems also to object that Great Britain is not entitled ( u qualifiee ') to verify the list of French dhow owners, 'ContreM(Smoire ) 'p.8. because this would involve a critical examination of French municipal legislation. Great Britain has no interests in, and makes no claim to examine into, French municipal legislation ; and is content to take the statement of France as to what such legislation is. But, as already stated, when France seeks to give extraterritorial effect or international validity to her municipal legislation, then the right of foreign Powers arises to question the validity and effect of such legislation outside its proper bounds. The French arguments as to making domicile a ground for claiming an originaire of Muscat as a French protege in Muscat have already been dealt with in the British Counter-Case (p. 10). It is enough to refer the Tribunal to these arguments and to add the following remarks :— 1. Domicile is not equivalent to nationality. 2. Domicile may give certain rights in the country in which it is acquired, and may alter the statut personnel or the descent of property by virtue of the rule mobilia sequuntur personam, but it gives no title to protection as a national in other countries, least of all in that of origin. 3. It lies with those who assert that the domicile of origin has been lost to prove the assertion. France has not adduced any evidence at all that any of the dhow owners of Muscat origin have acquired a domicile in any French possession. The Tribunal is, on this point, referred to the latest judicial exposition of the subject in the English Courts (Winans v. Attorney-General, Law Heports, 1904, Appeal Cases, p. 287)—a case in which the liability to taxation of the personal estate of a deceased American subject depended on whether he had become domiciled in the United Kingdom. EIGHTS OF POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TEREITOEIAL WATERS. It is not easy to see what bearing this question has upon the point sub mitted for decision in this Arbitration, but as it is very fully discussed in the French ' Contre-Memoire,' His Majesty's Government think it right to make some observations upon it. Perusal of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' discloses a tendency to confusion between three very distinct questions :— 1. The ' droit de visite, ' or right of search on the high seas;20 2. The police powers of territorial Sovereigns in their own waters; and 3. The extent to which a Power can exercise supervision or jurisdiction over its own vessels in the waters of another Power by permission of that Power. The question of the ' droit de visite '' has only an incidental bearing upon the present controversy. It is well known to all students of international law „ that France, for many years, whether from Contre-Memcire,' p. 54. , l • ji national sentiment, as suggested m the ' Contre-Memoire, ' or from particular theories of international law,- has been resolutely opposed to granting to any other Power the right to search vessels ' Confre-M&amp;noire,' p. 113. carrying the French flag on the high seas, • bescnb(d by a clerical error as of 1887 in the and that the naval instructions of 1867* British Case. mark the utmost limit of French conces sions to Great Britain on this point. Other powers which have taken the French view have, by adherence to the Brussels Act, assented to the search of certain vessels under their flag found in the Indian Ocean, and to that extent have granted the ' droit de visite. ' It is asserted that British officers have on occasion shown an excess of zeal or have gone beyond the instructions of 1867. Whether they have done 'Centre-M^moire,' pp. 125-149, 160-163. 80 58 Wll 1 0l i?. immaterial to' the present case, and His Majesty s Government do not think it necessary to discuss each ease in detail, and are content to point out that Article 13 of the instructions indicates the remedy to be pursued. Not content with a wholly unnecessary elaboration of French policy as to the' droit de visite,' the 'Contre-Memoire' under some misunderstanding puts forward the supposition that Great Britain denies or questions the rights and privileges of the French flag on the high seas. As between Great Britain and France, the question of the 'droit de visite ' has passed from the stage of international controversy to that of con vention by the regime agreed on in the Joint Instructions of 1867. As to other Powers which have acceded to the Brussels Act, ' droit de visite ' in the Indian seas is mutually conceded by the Brussels Act. His Majesty's Government can well conceive that a Power to whose subjects France has granted French papers and quasi-protection in the manner adopted as to Omanis might claim as against France to defeat such usurpation by search even on the high seas of such vessels; but it is not necessary to deal with any such contention in the present case. Before leaving this subject, it is, however, desirable to explain to the Tribunal that the desire of Great Britain that there should be a mutual right of search over native vessels in seas frequented by slavers—a desire which has been accomplished by the accession of almost every Power except France to such an arrangement—was to secure an effective international police of the infested seas instead of the isolated and ineffective national system which France prefers. Nothing was further from the desire of Great Britain than, as is suggested in the French ' Contre-Memoire,' to destroy the influence of France in these seas. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government must protest against the wholly gratuitous introduction of two documents relating to questions which arose between great Britain and the United States in 1857 and 1858 as to vessels suspected of. fraudulently using the American flag. The full text of the correspondence is to be found in the British 'State Papers,' volume xlv'iii, pp. 1244-1250, and volume xlix, p. 1103, ef. seq., and no doubt also m the American diplomatic correspondence. Great Britain and the United States were in perfect accord as to the necessity of stopping the oversea traffic in slaves under the American flag, and as to the accuracy of many, if not all, of the British statements. The only difference between the two Powers was as to the nature of the visite which a British vessel might make to a vessel onthe high seas flying American colours, and the United States were so far convin ced that their laws and surveillance were insufficient that more cruisers were detailed to suppress the ahuse of the flag, •• state Papers,' ,oi. .ii., p. ins. and that a Bm was submitted fa, Congress to strengthen the law against slave tradinsr. The Tribunal will also remember that the United States, in 1892, adhered to the Brussels Act. The right of police in territorial waters is wholly distinct from the ' droit de visite.' f ihe latter applies only to the high seas—the highway of nations. But it seems to be as fully admitted as any doctrine of international law that a public vessel of one State has no right to exercise police powers even over the merchant vessels of its own State in the territorial waters of another State. To quote the opinion of Mr. Nelson, Attorney-General of the United States, given in 1813 in the case of the schooner ' Arier'— ' It is quite clear that the seizure of an American vessel by another, also American, Opinions Of United States' Attorney-aeneial, Vol- within the jurisdiction of a foreign Government IV, p. 2S5, November 29, 1843. for an infringement of American revenue or navi-« cation laws is a violation of the territorial authority of the foreign Government/' Opinions to the same effect could be multiplied, but it is enough to say that it is an essential element in the conception of independent sovereignty that no foreign Power should, without the consent of the Sovereign, exercise withm his territory or waters any coercive jurisdiction over any person. It is of course, within the competence of the territorial Sovereign expressly to grant' or to acquiesce in the exercise within his waters by the public vessels of another State of powers of surveillance or police over merchant vessels flying the flao- of that State, and much of the French Case is taken up by an attempt to prove that this concession has been made to Prance by the Sultan of Muscat, or that this power has been, by Treaty, or acquiescence, or otherwise, acquired by France. France claims that in the waters of Oman she has acquired in some such wav the sole right of surveillance or police over vessels flying the French flag, and that the territorial authority of the Sultan is excluded. Her contentions have somewhat shifted on this point. In March 1902 the French Consul wrote to the Sultan that France only British &lt; aBe. p. 72-73. claimed the right of surveillance and British Case, p. 26. police conferred by the Brussels Act oyer vessels flying the French flag. It has already been pointed out in the British Case that the Sultan is not a Signatory to that Act, and that it does not give any Power any right of surveillance or police in the waters of another Power, though it does give to the Powers whch ihave adhered to Article XLI£ a mutual, right of search on the high seas. In 1903 M. Cambon stated to Lord Lansdowne that the Treaty of 1844 was not designed to meet the case of the British Case, p. 25. dhow ownerS) that their rights were in many cases anterior to the Treaty, that the French flag holders were altogether outside the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers, and were entitled to flv the French flag. This contention has already been stated and criticised at page 25 of^the British Case. But France has now abandoned the contentions of M. Laronce and M. Cambon, and in the ' Contre -Memoire' for the first time takes up the position that she is entitled under the Treaty of 1844 to the exclusive right of police m Muscat waters over vessels flying the French flag. The arguments in support of this contention are, for the most part, con tained in the opinion of M. Renault. In ' Contre-M^moire.' p 150. limine, His Majesty's Government ven ture to point out that, eminent as is the reputation of M. Renault, his opinioa 21can have no other effect on this arbitration than that of an advocate consulted by one of the High Parties to the arbitration, and that the case submitted to him for his opinion is not included in the ' Contre Memoire.' Great Britain contends (1) that Erance cannot rely on the Brussels Act to justify the exercise of police powers in those waters, because the Sultan is not a party to that Act, and because that Act specially reserves the rights of the territorial Sovereign as to vessels in his waters; (2) that the Sultan has done no act to surrender or delegate to Prance his authority in his own waters. 1. It is difficult to see how Prance can juridically meet the first of these contentions. Indeed, she endeavours to do so mainly by suggesting that the Slave Trade Treaties between Great Britain and Mascat upset the balance and equality which ought to result from the Declaration of 1862. This contention has already been disposed of in the British Counter-Case (p. 33). 2. But the socond contention is that which the weight of M. Eenault's opinion is directed to meet. Prance admits that the Sultan of Muscat— , 'Contre-M&amp;noirep. 37. . ' p^ssede fes droits que luf confere la souvera- mete sur ses sujets et dans ses Etats:' and includes in this admission the right to make Quarantine Regulations, but *'Centre-M^moire,' p. 38. makes a grievance of the fact that the _ Sultan, in enforcing the Regulations, has utilized the services of British subjects, for getting that if the right exists it is for the Sultan to decide on the executive agents to be chosen After these admissions and this complaint, a distinct and definite proposition is enunci- ateu i ■ a Si le Sultan de Mascate possede dans ses _ eaux territoriales un di.-it de police et de 'Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 38. juridietion a I'egard des navires arborant le sur les naviresj boutres, ou ^ •ti .

S Examination of that Article, which is printed at p 6 of the British Case, w.Il show tha it begins by granting permission to Frenchmen to buy sell, or take on lease lands, houses, and shops in Oman, and prohibits entry on any pretext, into the houses, shops, and other properties (' autres proprietes') possessed or occupied by Frenchmen or persons in French service It is perfectly clear from tbe context that the Article relates to ' imtneubles ' Ir rl giTes' aux fran^ais' a right to acquire them, and that in the sewmd place provides against violation of the domicile of ' fran 5 ais' who have acquired *'Contre-M^moire,' p. 151. such ' immeubles,' and of persons in v n , , Meir service. Nothing in the Article can be reasonably extended to ships, and though M. Renault so contsnds he does so faintly, saying that if the action of the territorial Sovereign is restricted on land, 'on peutafflrmer qu'il plus forte raison elle 1'est et doitl'Stre, poufha eaux temtonales. This amounts to reading into a document, on theoretical ' l ~' fS The Treaty is not silent about French ships, but ifs articles do not contain any express provision as to French vessels in territorial waters, or excluding the right of police by the Saltan, and do not give any colour to any theory of exemption from visit.

The statements of facts and the diplomatic documents to which he refers relate wholly and solely to Zanzibar, and not a single fact is stated with reference to the express or tacit admission in Omm of the existence in favour of France of the exclusive right of surveillance over French vessels v in Oman waters. The French Treaty of 1844 applied to Oman and Zanzibar as a single State for twelve years, until the separation of the two territories into distinct States in 1856. Thenceforth it was recognized by the Sovereigns of the two States as applying to each State separately. Nothing that happened between Frence and Zanzibar between 1866 and 1905 can be construed as binding the Sultan of Muscat either as matter of usage, concessions, or interpretation of the Treaty. The earlier Colonies in the Indian Ocean possessed by France were near Zanzi bar and far from Muscat, and France had to little concern 'with Oman that it was not until 189i that she installed a Vice-Oonsul there, or instituted any Court in which any person claiming to be her protege could be dealt with judicially. Nor is there any trace in the French ' Memoire' or ' Contre- Memoire' of any grant of French flags to Muscat vessels before 1891, or of any exercise by France of rights of police in Oman waters before that date. It is unnecessary to deal in detail with the various controversies which have arisen between Great Britain and France as to the territory and waters of Zanzibar, because they have, fortunately, been terminated by the arrangement . ,. . evidenced by the letters of the 13th and Appendix 4, p. 44. ■ ISth May, 1904. But His Majesty's Government cannot be considered as admitting that the contentions of France with respect to Zanzibar were juridically well-founded, although in a spirit of amity an adjustment has, in the case of Zanzibar, been effected which satisfies the aspirations of both Powers and meets the needs of the situation. M. Renault's arguments as to the effect on the status quo ante of the estab lishment of a Protectorate relate only to Zanzibar, and in no way affect Oman which is not a Protectorate. Before passing from this part of the Case, it is perhaps well again to point out that the main point in controversy is not whether France, has any power to Police in Oman waters vessels admittedly French, but whether France, by per mitting the use of her flag to persons who are not her subjects nor her proteges, nor within the immunities given by the Treaty of 184i, can extend to such persons any immunities she may possess in Oman. Even assuming that France had acquired some modified rights in Oman waters over vessels admittedly French, this is a very different thing from the claim of exclusive police in the Sultan's waters by French officials over any Arab dhow which flies the French flag. Still more does it differ from the claim which has hitherto been coupled with it that the owner and crews of such vessels and their families shall be exempt when ashore from the Sultan's jurisdiction. The true international rule on this subject is well stated in the decision of the United States' Supreme Court, of which an extract is given in Appendix, p. 5. THE CAPITULATIONS AND EXTEERITOEIALITY. A considerable portion of the French Counter-Case (pp. 39 et seq.) is taken up by arguments that the ' regime des Capitulations ' applies to Muscat. These arguments, except so far as they are based on Treaties with the Sultan, or established usage in his dominions, are an attempt to import into the relations of France with Oman usages which may exist between France and other Oriental States.24 It is acknowledged that Capitulations and Treaties or Conventions creatin g exterritoriality are exceptional and contrary to the ordinary rules of public international law, and that the exceptions arise from particular sanctioning documents or concessions from the Sovereign of the country to which they apply. As a general rule, therefore, in order to ascertain what extent the territoripl Sovereign is excluded from jurisdiction over the subjects or proteges of another Power, it is necessary to examine the Treaties, and, if need be, the usage in force between the territorial Sovereign and the other Power concerned, and it is rarely, if ever, of value to refer to the Capitulations existing with other Powers. Although, where several Powers have with an Oriental State Treaties giving exterritorial jurisdiction couched in somewhat different terms, but containing a most-favoured-nation clause, it may, as in the present case (see ante, p. 5) be necessary to examine all such Treaties in order to determine the exact limits of the extra-territorial jurisdiction conceded, it is never admissible to contend that because one Oriental Power has conceded a particular and wide exterritorial jurisdiction, a similar concession should be read into Capitulations made with another Oriental Pow r er ; nor can any argument be drawn from usage in the case of one Oriental Power to establish the existence of any such usage in the case of another Power.* The Ottoman Regulations of 1S63 and 1865, referred to both in the British and the French Cases, are relevant only as showing the determination of the Porte to put an end to the abuses of protection which then existed, and of the admission of the European Powers that the attitude of the Porte was consistent both with its territorial sovereignty and with international law, and the fact that these laws were not made retrospective is of no probative value in the present case, in which the question is whether certain persons are or are not now pro perly claimed by Prance as proteges. It may be observed that, under the Ottoman law of Nationality, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject unless he can prove to the c -ntrary, the onus probandi lying not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction, and the international Award between Greece and Turkey, set out at p. 91 of the British Case, is an even stronger and more authoritative international recognition of the limits which should be placed on extra-territorial jurisdiction, in Oriental ^States. As a matter of negotiation, distinct from a question of fact or of inter national or municipal law, the recognition of the claim of a certain limited number of persons to be proteges of claiming Power might be conceded as a means for determining a controversy, but such concession would be the price of peace, and not an admission of the justice of the claim, and it was as a matter of negotiation that the Porte made the concession in question, and not in affirm ation of any rule of international law. It may be added that in the long history of the Capitulations in Turkey very many Treaties had been made, and very many usages and abuses had grown up in the course of centuries ; while as between Muscat and Prance the extra territorial rights granted to Prance in Oman, whatever they may be, cannot be dated back beyond 1844. And while the situation in Turkey was complicated by the presence of a very large Christian population of numer^ us sects (each sect allowed by the Porte in many matters to be governed by the laws of its Church), perpetually invoking the sympathy and protection of Prance or Russia or some other European Power, the population of Oman is in the main Arab and Moslem, with very few Europeans or Christians, and only a few small communi ties professing some non-Moslem Eastern religion ; and thepersons whom Prance seeks to protect (unlike the Banians and Louwatias) are Arabs marked off from the rest of the Arab population of Oman only by the fact of the claim to Prench protection. The chief reason for the existence of exterritoriality is the difference •Hn thdse g^n^rale, if fant reconnaltre qn'en pareille mati^re il peut y avoir des qjuestions (Ttspfece suivant natnre des Proteetorats, et, encore, suivant les engagements des proteges et des protecteurs envers les autns nations.'-— M. Barbey, •' Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 213.i 00070 A between Oriental and European usages ; and in the case of the Siiri Arabs the raison d'tere of a claim of exterritoriality is excluded by the facts of their origin, race, religion, and residence. Having thus indicated the contention of His Majesty's Government that Capitulations with Turkey do not afford any sound foundation for any argument ^ in favour of France in the case of Muscat, it is necessary, before dealing with that part of the Trench Case which is based on the French interpretation of the Treaty of 1844, to dispose of certain refer- «• Contre-Mfhnoire,' p. 24. ences made to alleged inconsistency bet ween the British contentions and British practice. 1 The position of the Khojas or Louwatias has been fully explained in the British Counter-Case (pp. 35, 73). ' That explanation clearly shows that these persons, so far from being all incootestably subjects of the Sultan, form a distinct community of Indian origin, and under British protection if they choose to claim it; and that British officials have never gone beyond denying to a Khoja * the right to abjure British protection merely as a means of evading just debts. 2. In Persia Great Britain protects her Indian subjects settled there and their descendents to a limited extent, biit this right of protection has never been exercised in a way inconsistent with the law of Persia. The British view as to Persia is best expressed in the following extract from a despatch by Lord John Russell to Mr. Alison &lt;{ Considering the question apart from all questions of usage, policy, or expediency, but exclusively and strictly with reference to the principles of international law prevailing amongst Christian nations, I have to state to you that a child of a Persian father born in the Queen's dominions and returning &gt; to Persia will not, whilst in Persia, be entitled to British protection if (as stated) the law of Persia considers him a Persian subject by reason of his Persian descent ; and on this principle Syad Abdullah could not, whilst he remained in ^ Persia, claim, or be claimed to be, treated there as a British subject. Although, therefore, this would be the correct rule of international law, yet^ as it has not hitherto been acted on in Persia, I t ank it very inexpedient that it should now be made a rule of English procedure there unless it is also madj common to all other European nations, and especially France and Russia.' 3. Great Britain does not protect Jhinese subjects in Siam either with or without a condition as to three years' ' Contre-Memoire,' p. 24. residence there. In the year 1895 the question of such protection was discussed between the British and Chinese Gov ernments at a time when it was supposed that Japanese in Siam were to be protected by France. But Japan abandoned the idea of putting her subjects in Siam under Frence protection; and Great Britain never undertook the protection of the Chinese, which, be it said, in the absence of any Treaty bet ween China and Siam granting extra-territoriality, would, if undertaken, not have ousted the jurisdiction of the Siamese Courts. This disposes of the unfounded statement made at p. 24 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' A- - ' An Siam elle admet 1'inscription a sa Legation de Chinois qui ne sont pas nes sur un territoirebritannique ou place sous le protectorat anglais, mais qui resi dent depuis au moins trois ans a Bangkok. Ces Chinois sont alors consideres comme proteges britanniques, et ils ont meme obtenu que la protection qu lis j ouissent au Siam leur soit continuee quand ils se rendent en Chine. It will be, perhaps, more satisfactory to the Tribunal to know exactly what persons Great Britain does protect in Siam. The matter is governed by the # Anglo-Siamese Agreement of the 29tb November, 1899, which is in the follow ing terms:— ^ &gt; / A* Agreement between the United Kingdom and Siam relative to the Registra tion of British Subjects in Siam. ' Signed at Bangkok, November 29, 1899. 'The Governments of Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and of His Majesty the King of Siam, recognizing the necessity of having a satisfactory arrangement for the registration of British subjects in Siam, the Undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Minister Resident and His Siamese Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs duly authorized to that effect, have agreed as follows:— ' I. ' The registration according to Article V of the Treaty of April 18, 1855,* of British subjects residing in Siam, shall comprise the following categories : ' (1) All British natural born or naturalized subjects, other than those of Asiatic descent. . ' ( 2 ) All children and grandchildren born in Siam of persons entitled to be registered under the first category, who are entitled to the status of British sub jects in contemplation of English law. ' Neither great-grandchildren nor illegitimate children born iu Siam of persons mentioned in the first category are entitled to be registered. ' (3) All persoQS of Asiatic descent, born within the Queen's dominions or naturalized within the United Kingdom, or born within the territory of anv 1 nnce or State m India under these suzerainty of, or in alliance with, the Queen.

WaS 3,1 ongimire of Oman, struck him off the register of British FRENCH PEACTICE AS TO ' Jfrancisation.' In the French ' Contre-Memoire' (p. 11) it is said to be quite inaceu rate to make, m general and categorical terms, the allegation TlS French Consuls give protection papers to dhow-owners. His Majesty's Government are not concerned to allege or prove that all Prench Consuls are authorized so Wt and are content to indicate to particular instances in which they have done so' But it is a mistake to say that Great Britain has only given a single instance as to one port of the grant by French Consuls of French papersf namely at28 Aden The first instance, it is true, is that of the grant of French papers to Suri vessels by the French Consul at Aden. This action is admitted by France to have been irregular. His M ajesty's Government were for some years under the impression that M. Hibot's admission of irregularity was meant to apply to all cases of grant by French Consuls to Siiri vessels, and in the British Case re ference was made to M. Ribot's statement, not to impugn its correctness or pro priety, but to explain that upon a misunderstanding as to its exact effect Great Britain during some years refrained from protests, which would certainly have been made had its true meaning been understood. It is also clear that the French Consul at Zanzibar has in many cases granted, and not merely renewed or prolonged, titres de navigation. This is 8 admitted in the French Case (p. 14), 'Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 245. and in many of the annexed documents, particularly in the report M. Labosse of 22nd May, 1895. It is difficult to understand where the vessels at Siir can have obtained the French papers of which they are in possession. The two lists supplied give no indication. The documents contained in the French Counter-Case (p. 107) appear to show— (a)That at Mayotte no titre has been issued for six years, and that they are issued there only to •• Contre-M^moire,' p. 107. Frenchmen or French subjects. (h) That in French Somaliland it is quite the exception to grant to a dhow the right to fly the 'Oontie-M^moire,'p. 107. Frone h flag; and that be fore grant it is required that the vessel should— 1. Belong to a French Company; or 2. Belong to natives {indigenes) permanently resident ('6tablis a demeure ') in that territory and possessing realty there. (&lt;?) That in Madagascar, the Department concerned, has always refused the French flag to foreign ' Contre'M^moire,' p. 108, vessels. It is said not to be a regular practice to grant titres at French Consulates, and it may be presumed that the practice of granting them at the French Con sulate in Zanzibar, which is admitted to have prevailed at one time, has now been discontinued. Where, then, are the titres in question granted ? The natural and obvious conclusion would seem to be that they are granted at Maskat, and it is submit ted that this conclusion must prevail in the absence of more definite explana tions by France as to the origin of these grants. In bis letter of the 19th June, 1895, M. Ottavi says that no dhow had been registered (' inscrit *') at Muscat, and that all that he knew on the subject was that the Vali of Siir had told him there were in Sur thirty dhows jrancises. M. Ottavi also said that the British list submitted to him must be verified at Majunga (in Madagascar), Obokh, and Mayotte, and perhaps at Zanzibar, Contre-Memoire,' pp. 249-250). It is also stated in the French ' Contre- Memoire' (p. 14) that the French Consul, since he took up his post at Maskat, has made it a rule not to grant titres at Maskat or at Sur. It is diffi- cult to reconcile this statement, which is made in a report dated the 80th June, 1897, with the two titres printed at p. 46 of the British Case, the first dated in 1898, the second 1899, both issued at Muscat, and signed by M. Ottavi, who himself made the report in question. The inference appears to be that titres have been granted at Muscat in the first instance, and it seems not to be denied that a practice has prevailed of renewing there titres which had originally been granted elsewhere.00072 It is not easy to make out, from the statements in. the French ' Memoire and Contre-Memoire,' what is the law under which it is claimed that Trench Consuls may grant or renew litres to native vessels. It was stated in the British Case that the maritime law of Prance does not contemplate the grant of French papers ?So^e C M AS' p. 16. unless at least half the vessel is owned by 'Contie-Mdmoire.'p. French citizens. In the Frencn Contre- Memoire ' it is said that this law does not apply to the Colonies, and certain of the laws said to apply to them are given in an Appendix, ihis statement does not quite accord with the opinion expressed by M. Guy., Prench Consul at Zanzibar, and quoted at page 14 of the British Counter- Case But assuming M. Guy to be wrong and the statement in the « Contre- M&amp;noire ' to be accurate, neither Zanzibar nor Muscat is a French Colony ; and the authority of the Consul, if it exist, must be derived, from some general administrative discretion, or from some particular mstructions given to him wMch have not been included in the French ' Memoire or ' Oontre-Memoire,' ot from some law which has not been disclosed. But the Tribunal will find that the tit re granted at Aden m 1891 contains British Case, p. 49. a reference to the Law of 27 Vendemiaire, an a which is the foundation of the French maritime law and under which half the vessel must be owned by French citizens. It has already been pointed lu out that Article XXXII of the Brussels ••Contre-M&amp;noire,' p; 91. a g or ^ s no warrant for the grant of titres to native vessels by Consular officers, because the condition precedent to such grant can be satisfied only in a Colony or Protectorate of the power which p-rants the litre Until copies of the Hires granted to the Sun Arabs now in question are produced, it is not possible to know the sfatemeuts as to the resi- dence of the owner upon which they were granted. These statements would, in any case, require verification. The grant of protection to individuals is closely linked with the francisa- tion of vessels. France appears to contend that the latter turns the captain and crew and their families into French proteges pioio, and that the former has a like effect as to the individual and his descendants. It is not possible to trace in the French « Memoire ' or ' Contre-Memoire any distinct allegation that anv of the Omanis in question are French, either as citizens born or as natura- wi Jn French territorv. It is contended in the French Memoire and lized in irencn terniory. xv «eontre-M6moire' that the. terms of Contre-M&amp;noire,' p. 27. Article IV of the Treaty of 184)4 include not only domestic servants, but also— 'les emnlov^s, les commissionnaires, les agents detransport, tous ceux enfln, enun mot, qui rendent tea fide des services pour I'extension des re ations com- merciales, dont le Traite de 184.1 a voulu faciliter le doveloppement. The contention is obviously wrong. The phrase « au service ' clearly im plies engagement in the capacity of a clerk or domestic or some subordinate capacity; and it cannot include all persons with whom Frenchmen happen to have contracts of a commercial nature. In order to ascertain whether'any one of the 'boutriers originaires de Mascate ' is eutitled to French protection in Muscat, the following preliminary questions must be asked :— 1. Has he been naturalized in a French possession under the Decree printed at p. 76 of the French « Memoire? or 2. Was he born in a French possession of a father permanently establish ed there at the date of the birth ? or 3. Is he bond fide in the service of a French citizen ? It would be very difficult for Siiri sailors to satisfy the conditions of three vears* unbroken residence in a French Colony required by the Decree above cited. But even if the answer to questions 1 or 2 were ' Yes, it would not30 conclude the matter, for, as has already been pointed out, naturalization abroad is not binding on the Stote of origin, unless by the kws or the tacit absent of that State the right to alter allegiance is admitted, nor is birth in French territory of foreign parents conclusive of French nationality, and return to and settlement in the country of the father's origin would be a sufficient election not to rely on the accident of birth. France has not supplied, and says that she is not bound to supply, any in formation whatever as to any of her alleged proteges which would enable the Tribunal to answer any of the above questions. But if the information cannot be supplied her claim to protect fails, and her past interference with the Sultan's authority over such persons stands confessed as an unwarranted interference with his territorial jurisdiction. THE EFFECT OF ' FRANCISATION.' It is now proposed to consider what France claims to be the result, in Oman of the francisation of an Arab dhow owned by an Omani. Consideration has already been given to the French claim of exclusive or concurrent rights to police vessels flying the French flag in Oman waters. But it is also necessary to deal with the effect claimed on land. It is submitted that it is clear beyond all controversy that a grant to a vessel of the right to fly the French flag confers on the owner, master, and crew when on shore no immunity whatever from the jurisdiction of the local Sovereign. It is impossible to allow the claim which appears to be put forward by &lt;• Coatre-M^oire.' p. 28. France that the owners and master and crew of any dhow under the French flag are entitled to the same exterritoriality as Frenchmen, and that this privilege extends to the members of their family in direct line. No authority for any such claim has been put forward; it is opposed to every principle of law. CONCLUSION. The facts disclosed in the former documents have now been reviewed, and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom with respect to the French claims have been discussed. His Majesty's Government have refrained from contradicting in minute detail all the allegations contained in the French documents, the majority of which appear to them to be irrelevant to the questions at issue' but they are fully prepared to elucidate, by oral or written statement or arguments, or production of further documents, any points as to which the Tribunal may Require more light. They venture to submit that the statements and arrangements of the British Case and Counter-Case have not been met in any way by those in the French 4 4 Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' and that they are amply justified in main taining that the claim of France to protect 1,000 Omani Arabs and their families in their native country from their natural Sovereign is unwarranted by Treaty, usage, or international law, and amounts to an attack on the indepen^ dence of the Sultan, which is inconsistent with the obligations of France both towards the Sultan and Great Britain. His Majesty's Government submit that a review of all the evidence and documents establishes the correctness of the following propositions, which are the s ame as those set out in the original British Case : ,£ 1. No subject of the Sultan of Muscat acquires any right to the status of a French protege under the Treaty of 1844 by the fact that he is the owner, captain, or a member of the crew of a native vessel which has, by whatever means, obtained French papers or flag.« 2. By her adhesion to the XXXIInd Article of the Brassels Act of 1890, France is under an international obligation not to grant French flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner, at the time of grant, is (a) a French citizen, or is (b) a French protege by reason of his being a subject of a State under French protection. '3. France is equally debarred by the Declaration of 1862 from with drawing any subject of the Sultan of Muscat from the jurisdiction of the Sultan by the grant of French flags or papers, and the practice which prevailed up to June 1900 of making such grants trenches on the independence of the Sultan. (, 4i. No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquires any immunity from the Sultan's jurisdiction in the territories or territorial waters of Oman either for himself or for the crew of any ship commanded or owned by him, or for any member of his family or for any of his employes. ' 5. On the death of the owner of a vessel in respect of which a French titre de navigation has been granted, no right accrues to his heirs, as such, to treat the vessel as qualified to fly the French flag. The question in each case is one of personal status. ' 6. A titre empowering the flying of the French flag must be granted in respect of a particular vessel, and cannot be used by the holder in respect of any other. ' 7. France should, with all reasonable despatch, erase from her marine registers all native vessels owned by subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and, in co-operation with the Sultan, should take steps to obtain the surrender of all French flags and papers now held by any such subjects. '8. In all cases in which France still claims as subject or prot^g^ any owner or captain or sailor of an Omani native vessel, she should, with all reasonable dispatch, furnish to the Sultan any proofs on which she claims that such owner or captain or sailor is not a subject of the Sultan, but is a subject or protege of France.'

Muscat, March 23rd, 1905. APPENDIX 3. Extract from a Despatch from Mr. Sinclair to the Marquess of Lansdowne. Zanzibar, May 11th, 1905, (Extract.) An incident has just occurred here which is of interest in that it seems to show that we cannot yet relax the precautions which have been taken in past years for the prevention of slave trading. On the 5th instant Captain Baker-Baker, of His Majesty's ship 'Terpsi chore,' the Senior Naval Officer of this station, told me confidentially that ^ he had received reliable information that a dhow called tbe ' Eath-el-Keir, sailing under Erench colours, which had arrived here fi-om Sur in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd ultimo, intended leaving the harbour the following evening. She was then to anchor off a place called Bu-bu-bu, about 7 miles north of tie port, at which place the nakoda, or captain, had previously arranged with some of the natives that he would call and take on board their cocoanuts, so enabling them to evade the payment of duty. By holding out this induce ment he hoped to get about twenty-five of them on board, when it was his intention to confine them below deck and set sail on his return voyage to Sur, where it is commonly reported that slaves still fetch from 100- to 200 dollars, that is about 121. to 24Z. a-piece. Captain Baker-Baker's difficulty lay in the fact that he could not board a dhow flying the Erench flag without disobeying his instructions from the Admiralty, and, after consideration, we decided that, although the wisdom of ^ the course was doubtful, yet it seemed to be the only plan to take the Erench i Consul, with whom our relations have lately been of a very friendly nature, into my confidence, and to obtain his consent to the boarding of the vessel. I therefore saw M. Ottavi, who readily promised his co-operation. The next day, however, I received a letter from M. Ottavi stating that he had discovered some irregularities in the dhow's papers which gave him the power of refusing to renew her licence to fly the Erench flag, but that he had not then decided what action to take. Unfortunately, that morning, i.e., the 6th instant, Captain Baker-Baker received a telegram from the Admiral directing him to proceed at once to Durban, and he was, therefore, compelled to place the matter in my hands, but left his native interpreter behind, so as to keep me supplied with information. &lt; 32 yMr. Holers, whom I then consulted, at once made arrangements to have the dhow followed in case she slipped off in the night, and on the following day M. Gttavi asrain wrote to say that he had decided to refuse the renewal of the right to fly French colours to the nakoda, thereby forcing him to apply for a Sultan's flag at the Port Office. It was now fairly evident that we must, give up hope of catching the slavers red-handed, as there could be no doubt that they were aware that they were objects of suspicion, and I therefore decided that when the nakoda applied for his new papers, it might be as well to examine him. This I accordingly did. His name is Ali-bin-Salim Wateib, and he stated that he was a native of Batna, which is, I understand, an outlying part of Muscat, and that he was a subject of the Sultan of Oman. When asked how it was that he had been sailing under French colours, he said that his father, also a native of Batna, and a Sultan's subject, who had owned the dhow before him, had been, in the habit of trading between the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, Comoro, and Madagascar, and that, having married a Comoro woman, he was there given French protection and a licence to fly the flag. On the death of his father two or three years ago, he had been allowed to retain the licence, although he was not even a son by the Comoro woman. This appears to be a striking instance of the disregard of the Brussels Act which the French authorities have been in the habit of showing in the issue of their flag to persons who had no claim to it, and there can be little doubt that both the father of Ali-bin-Salim 'Wateib, who was, I am informed, a well-known slave trader, as well as Ali himself, used the flag thus acquired simply as a protection from interference of British men-of-war. Mr. Rogers has decided to withhold the grant of a provisional licence until the inquiries which he has instituted are completed. It is, of course, much to be regretted that we were unable to effect the capture of the dhow, and make an example of the nakoda and crew, but it may be hoped that their detention here will help to dispel the idea which I hear that the Persian Gulf Arabs seem to hold, that we are no longer on the qui vwe, and that they can therefore revive their old and nefarious ways with impunity. It is, of course, improbable that many slaves are nowadays shipped away from these islands ; but as I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my despatch No. 31 of the 20th April of last year, it is believed that a certain trade is still done between the Northern Coast of Portuguese East Africa and the Persian Gulf, and the case of kidnapping at Pemba, to which the above- quoted despatch referred, shows that the presence of a man-of-war is still desirable in these waters, especially during the first four or five months, that is from April to August, that the wind blows from the south-west.

I have tbe honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 13th instant, recapitulating the conditions of the Agreement which has been arrived at between His Majesty's Government and the Government of the Prench Republic for the closure of the French Consular Court at Zanzibar, and the recognition by the French Government of the British Tribunals established by the Orders in Council' of 1899 for the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba and the continental portions of the Sultanate of Zanzibar placed under British protection. I have pleasure in confirming the Agreement thus come to, the terms of which are correctly described in your Excellency's note. His Majesty's Government take note of your statement that it has been decided to close the French Consular Court at Zanzibar on the 15th September next. His Majesty's Government will make such arrangements as are required on their part for the due execution of those portions of the Agreement which relate to French proteges, and, without entering into the judicial question of the right of the Zanzibar Government to expel the nationals or proteges of foreign Powers by administrative process, they are willing to give an assurance that no such action shall betaken against French citizens or proteges without the concurrence of the French Consul. I take note with satisfaction of your Excellency's statement that it is the intention of the French Government to take measures without delay for winding up and closing the French post-office at Zanzibar.

' Homicide was committed in the course of an affray between two mem bers of the crew of a Belgian ship lying in the port of Jersey City in the United States. A claim was made by the Belgian Consul that the offence was justiciable only under Belgian law, because of the terms of the Conyention of the 9th March, 1880, between Belgium and the United States. The controversy was settled in the Supreme Court of the United States by a decision that the offence was justiciable in the State of New Jersey.' (Wildenhus* Case 1887, reported 7 Supreme Court Reporter 385 and 120 U. 8. Supreme Court Reports 1.) Below is an extract from the judgment of Mr. Waite, then Chief Justice of the United States:— 'It is part of the law of civilized nations that, when a merchant-vessel of one country enters the ports of another for the purposes of trade, it subjects itself to the law of the place to which it goes, unless, by Treaty or otherwise, the two countries have come to some different understanding or agreement; for, as was said by Chief Justice Marshall in The Exchange 7 Cranch, 144 : 'It would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction and the Government to degradation, if such merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country.' [United States c. Diekelman 92, U.S. 520; 1 Phillim., 4 Int. Law' (3rd Ed.) 483, section 351; Twiss, 'Law Nat.,' 229, section 159;Creasy, ' Int, Law,' 167, section 176; Halleck, 1 Int. Law' (1st Ed.), 171.] And the English Judges have uniformly recognised the rights of the Courts of the country of which the port is part to punish crimes committed by one foreigner on another in a foreign merchant-ship. (tleg. v. Cunningham Bell, 'Cr. Gas.,' 72; S.C. 8, Cox, s Cr. Cas.,' 104; Pieg. v. Anderson, 11, Cow, 4 Cr. Cas.,' 198, 204; S.C.L.R. 1, 1 Cr. Cas.,' 161,165 ; Eeg. v. Keyn, 13, Cox, *0^ Cas.,'403, 486, 525; S.C. 2, Exch. Div., 63,161,213.) As the owner has voluntarily taken his vessel, for his own private purposes, to a place within the dominion of a Government other than his own, and from which he seeks protection during his stay, he owes that Government such allegiance for the time being, as is due for the protection to which he becomes entitled. ' Erom experience, however, it was found long ago that it would be bene ficial to commerce if the local Government would abstain from interfering with the internal discipline of the ship, and the general regulation of the rights and duties of the officers and crew towards the vessel, or among themselves. And so by comity it came to be generally understood among civilized nations that all matters of discipline, and all things done on board, which affected only the vessel, or those belonging to her, and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquillity of the port, should be left by the local Govern ment to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged as the laws of that nation, or the interests of its commerce, should require. But if crimes are committed on board of a character to disturb/ the peace and tranquillity of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never, by comity or usage, been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws for their punishment, if the local tribunals see fit to assert their authority. Such being the general public law on this subject.

Ear ding e to M, Laronce. (Translation.) Sir, Zanzibar, June 8, 1898, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of to-day's date, on the subject of Salim-bin-Seif. I have just had a conversation as to this: matter with General Raikes. You are aware that a difference of opinion has for a long time past existed between our two Governments respecting the question of the conditions which justify the registration as French proteges of persons who could not claim that character in virtue of their origin, or of the text of the treaties. The correspon dence which has passed between Her Majesty's Agency and your predecessors on the cases (to cite only a few) of Sheikh Abdulla, of Salim-bin Abderahman, and of Salim-bin-Ali El Riani, indicates clearly enough the principles on which our view of this question rests, and I am therefore unable to admit that the mere fact of Salim-bin-Seif's being entered on your registers, or of the presence on board his dhows of a French flag, is sufficient of itself to withdraw him from the jurisdiction to which he naturally belongs. I have accordingly recommended General Eaikes, before taking any further step, to inquire from you as to the date and place at which the prisoners was registered, the authority which granted, and the grounds which led to, his registration. Should these particulars establish the right of Salim-bin-Seif to French protection. I will request the local Government to surrender him to you to be tried before your Court. So far his examination has elicited no reason which would warrant such a measure, for although he states that he was born (of an Arab father) in the Comoro Islands he* left, on his own showing, that territory nearly fifty years ago, and therefore at a period long anterior to the establishment of the French protectorate.

Vous m'ayez fait 1'honneur de m'adressar le 8 de ce mois une lettre au suiet de Taffaire Selim-bin-Seif. Vous constatez que nos deux Gouvernements profes sent une opinion differente sur la question de nationalite des personnes qui sereclament aujourd'hui de la protection franyaise. II semble que la consideration de ce sen! fait, d'ecliange de vues entre Paris et Londres a ce sujet, devait suffire a arreter le Prenlier Ministre de 8a Hantesse par interim dans I'application d'une mesure qu'il ne saurait encore justifier. Ainsi que je I'ai fait remarquer ce jour m&amp;ne au General Raikes, I'enquete a laquelle il se livre vis-a-vis de ce Consulat, apres les assurances contenues dans ma lettre da 7 courant, n'est point d'une correction absolue au point de vue des j^gles de la courtoisie internationale. Aucun Consulat etranger, a ce que je crois, ne saurait repondre a une pareille exigence de la part des autorites locales en ce qui concerne une question d'ordre int^rieur. J'ai rappele egalement au General Haikes qu'en Aout 1897, lorsque le u Majunga/' appartenant au meme proprietaire, fut arrete par Mr. Farler dans les eaux de Pemba, Sir Lloyd Mathews avait partage a Tegard de la nationalite de Selim-bin-Seif une opinion tout a fait contraire acelle qu'ii professe aujourd'hui.

Si rj Zanzibar, June 10, 1898. i have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of yesterday's date, and of the protest contained in it in the matter of Salim-bin-Seif. I cannot admit that the request made to you by General Raikes was not a proper one from the point of view of the rules of international courtesy. A Pemba Arab, to all appearance a local subject, is arrested for an act of Slave Trade. He admits having been, until quite recently, a Sultan's subject, but states that he received some time ago, on his simple application and without the authorization of the local Government, French protection and a French flag. No Government can recognize the right of a foreign Consulate to withdraw one of its subjects from its jurisdiction without even deigning to inform it of the reason for which it claims to do so. If in France a British Consul were to demand that a person who was to all appearance a French citizen, and was born and domiciled in French territory, should be exempted from military service because he was registered as a British subject on the Consular registers, the French authorities would, I think, before granting this demand, require to be informed of the circumstances on account of which he had been so registered, and should the British Consul refuse so state them, would reject it. Such a proceeding on their part would certainly appear to me a very natural one, and could not be criticized as improper. The German Consulate, for example, with which we have frequently had differences of this kind, has never, so far as I am aware, made any difficulty about stating its grounds for recognizing a parti cular person as a subject or protege of Germany.Inclosure 6 in No. 1. Brigadier-General Baikes to Laronce. Zanzibar, June 12, 1898. Sir, I am in receipt of your despatch dated the 11th June, and I acknowledge, with many thanks, your reasons for claiming Salim-bin-Seif as a Trench proteg6; but as regards his being born in Comoro, he himself says he was ; but I have heard from other Pemba Arabs that he was born in Pemba. But this matters little, as at the time of his birth, which he says was about forty-five years ago, the French had not annexed the island, and therefore it can make very little material difference. As regards his having bought the dhow ' Selamti ' at Mayotte and himself being registered there, it seems a mistake, as he himself says the ' Selamti'' never belonged to him, but to Salim-bin-Ali, and that he was captain or sailor in her for four years ; but as to that being true, it would hardly make Salim-bin-Seif a French protege, as, I believe, it has been decided in London before, that buying a house in Comoro does not allow the buyer to claim French protection, therefore, I suppose, likewise a dhow, also before the time of annexation ; but this is immaterial, as Salim-bin-Seif says he never did own the ' Selamti.' I have referred your letters to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, and he concurs with me that as yet there are no grounds for handing Salim-bin- Seif over to your Court. As regards the case of the tc Majunga ' last year, I beliove it was not liberated on account of nationality, but as Mr. Farler could not clearly prove his case as to the shipment of slaves, the matter was allowed to drop and the dhow liberated, and I don't think Salim was produced in your Court for slave- dealing, the case not being continued with : therefore I do not think Sir Lloyd Mathews had any correspondence as regards the nationality of Salim-bin-Seif. I have no wish to keep Salim-bin-Seif after you have fully satisfied myself and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General with regard to his notionality to our satisfaction. I have, etc., (Sd.) A. E. EAIKES, Acting Trime Minister. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Judgment on Salim-bin'Seif. salim -BIN-SBIF,—You have claimed French protection, but as you have not proved yourself such to my satisfaction, about which I will give my reasons later, I have proceeded with the case of slave-dealing against you, and am now going to pronounce judgment. The evidence of all the slaves (seven) you have heard, and also of Nahotha Bakari and the two Askaris, and also of Nasoro-bin-Ali. Their evidence all more or less coincides. They (the slaves) say they were caught by Mwambieni and Mwabruki, acting Nahotha for you, taken to the beach at Kinzu, and shipped in a small dhow and taken and landed at Ndunne in a ' dug-out ' with Mwambieni, where they met you, and were taken into some mangroves by you; later they saw Nahotha Bakari, who told them they were going to be shipped, and had better run away. Then they say Askaris came and caught them, and that you w;ere there ; that the Askaris pointed their rifles at you, and yo u 41 c4 (19FPsaid, ' Don't shoot me, I am Salim/' and then you went away. Some of the slaves say they know you well. Then the evidence of the Askaris is that they were sent for, as some slaves were going to be shipped; they, and also a witness named Athman, hid in the bushes, saw and heard you hail a 14 dug-out,' and the men in the ' dug-out ' hailed back ; youthen beckoned to the slaves to follow you, when they (the Askaris) jumped at and caught the slaves,. Pointing their rifles at you, you said, ' Don't shoot me, I am Salim.' Their reason' for not arresting you was, that they both knew you well, and could catch you any time, and had plenty of witnesses, and were doubtful whether they had the right, owing to having heard in the island that you were a Erench protege ; also, they all have recognized the dhow as yours. Nasoro-bin • Ali's evidence, as to your former character, was, he said, that many people—in fact, every one in Pemba—knew you as a slave-dealer ; Nahotha Bakari also says he heard you bargaining as to a number of slaves with Nosoro-bin-Eashid. Therefore, on this evidence, which you have heard. Sheikh Barhan, Government Kathi, and myself, have gone into it, and have found you guilty of slave dealing, in that you have been caught in the act of trying to ship slaves, and none of them belonging to you ; therefore we sentence you to one year's rigorous im prisonment. Now, as regards your being a French protege, you say you were born in Comoro about forty-five years ago, that you have no property there and never had, your reason for being a Erench protege is, you say, because you have dhows carrying the Erench flag, which you say were registered here, one three years ago, and the other last year; and after leaving Salim-bin-Ali s service you bought dhows which you got registered here under the Erench flag, about five or six years ago. Before thaAou were, as you say. His Highness' subject, except when you were a captain of a dhow named ' Sclamti,' which belonged to Salim-bin-Ali, a supposed Erench protege, as far as you know; and you say that if, when you were captain of the Selamti,' you had left her, you would be His Highness' subject, only having protection for the time of serving. When arguing the right of your Erench protection with the Erench Consul here he seemed to base his argument on the idea that the ' Selamti was owned by you; but you yourself say you never owned it; therefore, he was under a misapprehension ; and as to your being born in Comoro, that is immaterial, as you were born there forty-five years ago and never since possessed property there or resided there, and you say yourself you are a Muscat Arab, but have lived all your life in Pemba, and many Pemba Arabs say you were born there, as far as they^have heard. I think from this you will clearly see that you are under a misappre hension as to your protecting Power, and also that it was a mistake of the Erench Consul to give you the French flag for your dhows. And as I have not been satisfied with your explanation or that of the Erench Consul as to your being a Erench protege, I must send you to prison to carry out the sentence passed on you, (Signed) SHEIKH BURHAN.

Mon cher Sir Thomas Sanderson, Vpici le sens de la communication de mon Gouvernement dont nous avons parle tout ^ }.'heuro 43M. Geoffray, in claiming the surrender of this person to the French Consuj at Zanzibar, lays stress upon the fact that the papers originally handed to him at Mayotte were registered at the French Consulate at Zanzibar as long ago as 1889, and that since that date Salim has made repeated voyages to Madagascar and elsewhere in vessels owned by him and ostensibly under the protection of the French flag. Her Majesty's Government cannot, however, admit that the French Con sul, by merely registering a subject of Zanzibar as a French-protected person* is able to withdraw bim from the jurisdiction of the Tribunals of his natural Sovereign; nor can they assent to the view that he ought to be considered as having been so withdrawn simply because he sailed in vessels which were permitted by the French authorities, though with what justification does not at present appear, to fly the French flag. There is nothing, indeed, to show that Salim ever had the Sultan of Zanzibar's permission to register either him self or the ships as being under French iprotection. M. Geoffray further adduces the conduct of the Zanzibar authorities on the occasion of the arrest by Mr. Farler last year of Salim's dhow as a proof that the man's personal status is now beyond controversy. I have, however, to observe, that on that occasion the question was not whether Salim was a French-protected person, but whether there were sufficiently serious reasons for suspecting him to be engaged in the Slave Trade to justify his arrest and that of the vessel. The Zanzibar Government decided that there was not sufficient evidence to authorize such a measure, and the dhow was accordingly set at liberty. In the case under discussion, however, the proofs were enough to caus e Salim to be arrested, and it then became necessary to enter upon the question o^ jurisdiction. I inclose a copy of the judgment pronounced in the case. Tour Excellency will perceive that Salim-bin-Seif declare that he was a subject of the Sultan except during the period when he was in command of a dhow belonging to a man alleged to a French-protected person. But the fact of Salim having taken such service could not even temporarily divert elsewhere the allegiance which he owed to the Sultan of Zanzibar. Her Majesty's Government therefore remain of opinion that Salim is a subject of Zanzibar, and are unable to find anything in the facts alleged which in any degree cancels his allegiance to the Government of that country. I have, etc., (Signed) SALISBURY. No . 5. The Marquess of Salisbury to Sir A. Eardinge. Sir, Foreign Office, December 14th, 1898. The attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called by several cases which have occurred during recent years to the serious inconvenience occasioned to the Administration of the Sultanate of Zanzibar by the grant of French protection to natives who do not appear to be entitled to it, either by the Treaty between France and Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, which regulates the relations of France to Zanzibar, or by the other Treaties with Zanzibar, to the benefit of which France is entitled under the operation of the most -favoured-nation clause in her own Treaty. The Treaty between France and Muscat contains the following Articles :— 'Article III. Les Fran^ais auront la faculte d'acheter, de vendre, ou de prendre a bail des terres, maisons, magasins, dans les Etats de Son Altesse le 44Sultan de Mascate. Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins, et autres proprietes, possedes ou accupes par des Pransais ou par des persounes au service des Prar^ais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de 1'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec Fintervention du Consul de France. ' Les Prangais ne pourront, sous aucun pretexte, etre retenus contre leur volonte dans les Etats du Sultan de Mascate. ' Article IV. Les sujets de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate qui seraient au service des Tranyais jouiront de la meme protection que les Frar^ais eux- memes ; maissiles sujets de Son Altesse sont convaincus de quelque crime ou infraction punissable par la loi, siils seront congedies par les Fra^ais au service desquels ils se trouvent, et livres aux autorites locales/' It tlms appears that the only native persons who can, in virtue of the provisions of the Treaty regulating the relations between France and Zanzibar, claim French protection or fly the French flag on their dhows are 1. Natives of French Protectorates, who were there resident, or, least, were not resident in Zanzibar when the said Protectorates were established; and 2. The bond fide servants of French citizens and proteges; the local authority to be judge of what constitutes bond fide service. The Treaty excludes, therefore, from French protection all persons not born in French possessions or dependencies, though they may have acquired land there and have been inscribed on the French Consular Kegister at Zanzibar or Muscat. The officers of the Administration of the Sultanate have therefore a right to decline to recognize exterritorial privileges to native vessels flying the French flag until satisfied that the owner is a fide citizen or protege of France. It would not be necessary, in order to act on this principle, to board or search the vessel under the French flag, but in any case in which the Administration had reason to believe that the flag was being improperly hoisted, the master, when he came on shore, would be called upon to produce his papers,'and prove that he was a French protege in the sense which I have indicated in this despatch. If he refused to produce his papers, he would be arrested. In such matters, it would be proper for the officers of the Adminis tration to be guided by the principles of the Ottoman Nationality Law, which has been accepted in Turkey by the foreign Powers, and may, therefore, be assumed to contain nothing contrary to the due exercise of the privileges of exterritoriality. Under that law, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject until he has proved that he is not one according to the law in question, the onus probandi lying, not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privileges of exemption from its jurisdiction. It will be observed in reference to the French Treaty with Muscat (and indeed, with reference to the Zanzibar Treaties generally) that it speaks onlv'of French citizens or persons in the service of French citizens; the Administration of the Sultanate may therefore refuse, as the Porte has always done to recognize Tunisians and natives of Comoro as entitled to the benefits of the Treaty 0 All the more may those benefits be refused to persons who are not even natives of French Protectorates, not withstanding that they may at one time or other have been improperly allowed the status of French proteges. I authorize you to act, in any cases that may arise in the future, on the principles indicated in my present despatch. I am, etc..

No. 8.* The Marquess of Salisbury to Mr. Herbert. gir, Foreign Office, September llth 3 1899. Before the Sultanate of Zanzibar came under the Protectorate of Her Majesty in 1890 the protection by foreign Powers of individuals living ^ in His Highness'dominions was exercised without reference to any very strict code of rules. To this state of things must no doubt be attributed the relatively large number of cases in which, since the establishment of the British Protec- torate, particular persons have received or have claimed the protection of European Powers in circumstances which did not appear to Her Majesty's Government to warrant the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's juris diction. Many of these cases have formed the subject of correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and foreign Governments and between their Representatives in Zanzibar. Some cases have been settled by compromise, and not always in accordance with the strict interpretation of the rules which should have governed them; others are still pending or have settled themselves by efflux of time. It is necessary, however, that the protection of individuals by foreign Powers should be strictly limited to those cases where it can be undoubtedly justified by the Treaties existing between Zanzibar and the foreign Powers concerned. Her Majesty's Government, after giving careful consideration to the question, have instructed Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar, as to the rules and principles which must in future guide the Sultan's Govern ment in deciding whether, in any given case, the right of foreign protection is properly exercised. So many of the cases forming the subject of corre spondence have concerned the Prench Consulate, that I think it right to inform the Prench Government of the circumstances which have led to the above -mentioned instructions being sent to Zanzibar, and of the nature of the instructions themselves. As regards Prance, the attention of Her Majesty's Agent and Consul- General has in the first place been drawn to the serious inconvenience occa sioned to the Sultan's Administration by the grant of Prench protection to natives who do not appear to be entitled to it, either by the Prench Treaty with Maskat of the 17th November, 1844, or by the other Treaties with Zanzibar, to the benefit of which Prance is entitled under the operation of the most-favoured- # nation clause in our own Treaty. The Treaty between Prance and Maskat contains the following Articles ;-r ' ARTICLE III. ' Les Prancais auront la faculte d'acheter, de vendre ou de prendre a bail des terres, maisons, magasins, dans les Etats de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate Nul de pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasions, et autres propriety, possedes ou occupes par des Pra^ais ou par des personnes au service de Pran9ais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Poccupant, a moms que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de Prance.48 ' Les Pranpais ne pourront, sous aucun pretexte, ^tre retenus centre leur volonte dans les Etats du Sultan de Mascate. ' ARTICLE IV. ' Les sujets de Son Altesse le Sultan de Macate qui seraient au service des Erancais jouiront de la mdrne protection que les Eramjais eux-toemes; mais si les sujets de Son Altesse sont cqnvaincus de quelque crime ou infraction punissable par la loi, ils seront congedies paries Era^ais au service desquels ils se trouvent, et livres aux autorites locales.' The Treaty in its terms applies only to Erenchmen (' Era^ais') and their servants. By usage the benefit of its provisions has been extended to natives of Erench Protectorates. But it is to be observed that subjects of Zanzibar cannot be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Sultan's Courts without his consent, and the mere recognition by the Erench authorities that such persons are subjects of Erench Protectorates is for this purpose quite inoperative. Moreover, such persons, in order to be entitled to the benefit of the Treaty, must be in fact bond fide subjects of Erench Protectorates, and the circum stance that they have been inscribed on the Eench Consular Register at Zanzi bar or Maskat cannot be regarded as sufficient for this purpose. The officers of the Administration of the Sultanate have, therefore, a right to decline to recognize ex-territorial privileges to native vessels flying the Erench flag until satisfied that the owner is a bond fide citizen or protege of Erance (' Eran- Qais'). In such matters it would be proper for the officers of the Administration to be guided by principles similar to those of the Ottoman Nationality Law, which has been accepted in Turkey by the Eoreign Powers, and may, therefore, be assumed to contain nothing contrary to the due exercise of the privileges, of ex-territoriality. The onus probandi lies, not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction ; and any person claiming exemption must establish his right to such exemption by sufficient evidence. The benefits of the Zanzibar Treaties cannot be extended to persons who are not bond fide natives of Erench Protectorates, notwithstanding that they may at one or other have been allowed the status of Erench proteges without a sufficiently careful consideration of their right to that status.

Vice-Consul Sinclair to Mr, Cave. C1iaki'ChaTci } Fewha, October 85 1 1899. I have the honour to submit the following report with reference to the case of Salim-bin-Seif, which, in accordance with your verbal instructions, I have made the subject of special inquiry :— Your information that he is now in Government employ is without found ation, and Captain Taubmann, whom I consulted, and who gave me very great assistance in collecting evidence as to his parentage, was of opinion that it would be unwise to interview Salim (or Msellim, as his correct name seems to be), as he is known to be still antagonistic to the Government, and it might lead him to attach importance to his case. Inquiries, however, which I made at Weti leave little room for doubt that he was not, as he stated, born at Comoro, but here in Pemba. An M Pemba, named Hamis-bin-Taid, whose evidence I first obtained, stated that he had known Msellim-bin-Seif all his life, having been brought up in the same village with him; his mother, who died about three years ago, was, he said, a Pemba woman, named Binti Ali, the daughter of Ali-bin-Suliman, of Kinyazim—a place just south of Weti. She married a Maskat Arab named Saif who settled at Pemba, and this witness is willing to swear that Binti Ali never left Pemba, and that Msellim was born there. An old Arab named Abdulla-bin«Salim-bin- Abdulla of Kwimone confirmed the above evidence, and added that he remem bered the marriage taking place here. I inclose his written statement that Msellim was bom in Pemba. This witness, on being asked if he had ever heard that Msellim possessed property elsewhere, said that he had heard that Saif Msellim's father, Gazija (Comoro) who possessed property there. The most direct and convincing proof as to Msellim's birthplace is, how ever, that furnished by Selimah-binti-Juma-bin-Suliman, who was examined by one of the native officers. Captain Simba ; this woman is a cousin of Msellim's mother, whose name she says was Bisharah-binti-Ali-bin-Suliman, who was born at Pemba, her mother being a native Pemba girl; Selimah states that she was actually present at the birth of Msellim-bin-Saif, which took place at Chavani, and that he had one brother, who died in infancy, and a sister whose mother was a Suria named Eaida, Another witness, Khamis-bin-Saif, declared that there was a third son named Mahomed-bin-Saif by a wife from Gazija (Comoro). In view of this evidence, which is amply confirmed by others, there can be little doubt that Msellim-bin-Saif only assumed false nationality, and so obtained French protection in order to more safely carry on his well known malpractices in slave-trading, to which their flag has unfortunately acquired the undesirable reputation of affording an effective screen in these waters—a reputation which his punishment has, so I am informed, done much among the natives of this island to eradicate.

(No. 1.) My Lord, The Hague, July 24, 1905. I HAVE tlie honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith the text of Supple mentary Conclusions presented by the French Government to the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal. These conclusions were communicated to me by the French Agent this afternoon, and did not reach me till 5*30 p.m. Your Lordship will observe that the French Government base their action, which is contrary to the provisions of Article 11 of the ' Compromis ' of the 13th October, 1904, on the consideration that, whereas the French conclusions were merely a resumi of contentions already advanced, the British argument was, in reality, a new Counter- Case, into which fresh facts and arguments had been introduced. France has therefore found it necessary to enter a reply. I have ascertained from the Secretary of the Tribunal that the French Supple mentary Conclusions had not reached him before he closed the Tribunal this afternoon. They cannot therefore be handed to the Arbitrators until the Court meets to-morrow morning at 11 a.m. The unexpected action of the French Government creates a situation which was not contemplated in my instructions. It is, moreover, impossible for me to ascertain your Lordship's wishes as to the attitude I should adopt before the Tribunal meets. The matter appears, however, to be primarily one for the decision of the Tribunal. In the circumstances, I propose, when the Court meets to-morrow morning, to take no action until I have ascertained the attitude of the Arbitrators. They may decline to accept the Supplementary Conclusions. In the event of my being consulted, I propose to draw attention to the irregularity of the French procedure on this occasion, to state that I have referred the matter to your Lordship, and to request that the consideration of the question may be postponed pending the receipt of your instructions. Should the Court decide to accept the conclusions, I will make a full reservation of the right of His Majesty's Government to reply, under Article III of the ' Compromis ' I have examined, with Mr. Craies' assistance, the French Supplementary Con clusions as carefully as the short time at our disposal permits. Beyond certain statements, unsupported by documentary evidence, regarding the alleged grant to Siiris of Zanzibar flags, they do not appear to contain any fresh points of fact of any importance, nor are they likely to materially assist the French, or affect the British, Case. Copy of a Memorandum by Mr. Craies on this subject is herewith annexed. Moreover, had the French Government requested permission to submit these Supplementary Conclusions to the Court, it is probable that His Majesty's Government would not have objected, subject to a full reservation of their right to reply. I would venture to submit, for your Lordship's consideration, that, subject to such a reservation, I might be authorized to. agree, if the occasion arises, to the submission to the Tribunal of the French Supplementary Conclusions, in spite of the belated and irregular manner in which they have been presented.

THE Supplementary Conclusions are a belated attempt— 1. To meet the arguments in the Counter-Case ; 2. To reply on the British Argument; 3. To allege that the latter creates faits nouveaux.

Great Britain in the Argument has followed the terms of Article III, paragraph 3, o± the ' Compromis.' *The argument as to the Treaty of 1844 is not new. (See British Case, pp. 7, 11.)

WITH reference to my despatch No. 5 of yesterday, I have the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 10'30 this morning. The Secretary-General opened the proceedings by reading aloud a letter which I had addressed to the Court yesterday afternoon to the effect that it was not our intention to reply to the last statement made by the French Agent, unless the Court expressed a wish for further elucidations. My statement in the above sense, copy of which was inclosed in my despatch No. 5 of yesterday, was then delivered to the Tribunal. The President, after consulting his colleagues, stated that no further elucidation of the question was necessary, and declared the Court adjourned until the final sittings. He was unable to state definitely when that would be, but promised that forty-eight hours' notice should be given I gather that the Court will probably meet to deliver judgment on Monday, the 7th, or at the latest on Tuesday, the 8th instant. As your Lordship is aware, from my immediately preceding despatch, the Tribunal had rejected as irrelevant to the question at issue the two papers granted by the British East Africa authorities to natives of Sur, entitling them to use the Zanzibar flag, which the French Agent endeavoured to produce to the Court. There was therefore no occasion for me to read to the Court the telegram from the Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, as suggested in your Lordship's telegram No. 2 of last night. I have, however, communicated a paraphrase of it to the French Agent for his informa tion, and I will see that this simple explanation of the grant of these papers is brought privately to the knowledge of the Arbitrators.

SENTENCE ARBITRALE DE LORD CANNING communlqufie sous forme de lettre 1 seyyid madjid, sultan de Zanzibar, et 1 Seyyid Thouweyni, Sultan de Mascate. Beloved and Esteemed Friend, I address Your Highness on the subject of the unhappy differences which have arisen between Yourself and your Highness' brother the Imam of Muscat, and for the settlement of which Your Highness has engaged to accept the arbi tration of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Having regard to the friendly relations which have always existed between the Government of H M. the Queen and the Government of Oman and Zanzibar, and desiring to prevent war between kinsmen, I accepted the charge of arbitra tion between You, and in order to obtain the fullest Knowledge of all the points in dispute, I directed the Government of Bombay to send an officer to Muscate and Zanzibar to make the necessary enquiries. Brigadier Coghlan was _ selected for this purpose, and officer in whose judgment, intelligence and impartiality the Government of India reposes the utmost confidence. Bridadier Coghlan has submitted a full and clear report of all the questions at issue between Your Highness and your brother. I have given my most careful attention to each of these questions. The terms of my decision are as follows : 1st. That His Highness Seyyed Madjid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of his late Highness Seyyid Said. 2nd. That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Muscat a sub sidy of 40,000 crowns. 3rd. That His Highness Seyyid Madjid pay to His Highness Seyyid Thou weyni the arrears of subsidy for two years or 80,000 crowns. I am satisfied that these terms are just and honourable to both of you ; and as you have deliberately and solemnly accepted my arbUrat.on I shall expect that you will cheerfully and faithfully abide by them, and that they will be carried out without unnecessary delay. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recogm- lion of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither •s it to be considered as merely personal between Your Highness and your brother Seyyid Thouweyni. It is to extend to your respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar and adjusting the inequality between the two inheri tances derived from your father, His late Highness Seyyid Said, the venerated friend of the British Government, which two inheritances are to be henceiorward distinct and separate. I am your Highness' sincere friend and well wisher, (Sd.) CANNING.

Reply on behalf of the Government of His Britannic Majesty to the Supple mentary Conclusions presented on behalf of the Government of the French Republict and admitted by the Tribunal on July 25, /poj*. His Majesty's Government at the outset venture to point out to the Tribunal that the criticism made in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions ' (p. 5) on R the form of the British Argument is n is ase, p, 3. founded on a mistake. That Argument is framed in strict accord with the third paragraph of the English text of the ' Com- promis,' and with the precedents of the British Arguments in numerous cases of arbitration, among which reference may be made to the arbitrations as to the Alabama Claims (1872),'the Behring Sea Seal Fisheries (1893), the Venezuelan Boundary (1899), and the British Guiana and Brazil Boundary (1904). In exercising the right of reply granted by the Tribunal on the 25th July, 1905, His Majesty's Government will confine themselves strictly to the points raised in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions,' so far as they seem to re quire any reply. INTERVENTION OF THE SULTAN IN THE ARBITRATION. In the ' Conclusions Complementaires ' (p. 7) an attempt has been made to _ . . ^ „ show that the Sultan has been unwillingly ' Conclusions Complemsntaires, p. 7. , , . , 0 y dragged into the present case. Careful examination of the documents on which the French objections are made, which are printed on p. 40 of the British Counter-Case, will show that before the conclusion of the ' Compromis ' in October 1904, Great Britain and the Sultan were perfectly in accord as to the presentation of arguments as to French immunities in Oman, and that the letter of the 29th July, 1903, so far from being an unsuccessful attempt, embodied an accepted arrangement, while the letter of the 19th March, 1905, is merely an indication that the Sultan had not at his disposal any Agent competent to argue the case at The Hague, and (to quote his own words) 'requested that His Majesty's Government would repre sent me and endeavour to gain my object (' et s'efforcer de gagner mon proems , ).' PUBLICATION OF UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. His Majesty's Government, upon the statements made under this head at „« , . - .. , . „ p. 9 of the' Conclusions Complementaires,*' 1 t-Onclusions Complementaires, p. 9. , , . , * , ' nave only to observe that no more has been done than to call the attention of the Tribunal to what appears to His Majesty's Government to be the irrelevancy of a great many of the French alle gations and arguments. The document of the 14th August, 1901, given to Lord Lansdowne by M. Cambon, whatever its value, is, at any rate, directly relevant to the British Case. But the discussion of general British policy in Oman appears to His Majesty's Government not to be in issue under the ' Compromis, and, whether the Agreement of 1862 be a diplomatic or a political document, there appears to be nothing in the st Compromis ' which would justify an elabo rate review of British policy in the Persian Gulf.THE SULTAN'S NOTIFICATION. The British Argument (p. 7) has established that the parties were using different texts of the same notifications. ' Conclusions Compi^mentaires.'-p n. It is common g round between the parties that the two texts speak prospectively, and the only issue between them on the notification is whether they constitute a recognition by the Sultan that the Suris, who had already agreed to surrender to him, or had surrendered to him their French titres, were still to be recognized as entitled to use them. The British contentions have been summarized on p. 8 of the British Argument, and are, it is submitted, not touched by any of the observations made in the ' Conclusions Complementaires. THE SULTAN'S PROTESTS. It will be seen from the British Case that the arrest of the men who broke „ , quarantine, which immediately led to the ' Conclusions Complementaires,' p. IS- , ic ^ * &gt;i i vi present Compromis, was made without any idea that the persons in question claimed French protection, and that it was that claim which led to the arbitration. The undated letter to (not 'from') Colonel Mockler, on which France relies, has already been discussed in the „ . . , _ British Argument (p. 4), and in no way British Case, p. 20. . . c £ . Vr t/J .7 justines the interpretation put upon it. His Majesty's Government call attention to the admission that France has been aware since 1895,— i.e., immediately after establishing a Vice-Consul at Muscat,— of the Sultan's attitude, but venture to suggest that, in . view of the facts and documents set out in the British Case (p. \2 et seq.), it cannot be described as a new attitude even at that time. IMPORTATION INTO THE CONTROVERSY OF THE TREATY OF NOVEMBER 17, 1844. France is in error iri suggesting that the reference in the British Argument . 1 {vide pp. 5 and 6) to the Treaty between ' Conclusions Complementaires,' pp. 5 and 17. in* r , , France and Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, is in any sense a fait nowveau. That Treaty is referred to in the British Case (pp. 6, 11), and an argument is founded on it on p. 24. In the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 7) it is con tended that this Treaty is res inter alios acta, and the references to the Treaty in the British Argument (p. 5) are made in response to the contentions of the French &lt;( Contre-Memoire,' and are merely directed to establishing that it is impossible to consider adequately the matters submitted to the Tribunal with out examining the terms of the Treaty. There seems also to be a misunderstanding on the part of France as to the ' Conclusions Compi^nentaires,' p. 17. nature of the British argument with refer ence to the interpretation of the Treatv of British Argument, pp. s, 6. the 17th November, 1844. His Majesty's Government have distinctly recognized that the most-favoured-nation clauses in the Treaties of 1844 and 1891 put France and Great Britain on an equality. With respect to the persons who may claim exterritoriality, whichever Treaty gives the wider immunity establishes the measure of the privileges both of Great Britain and of France. Great Britain makes no attempt to diminish the rights of France under the Treaty of 1844, and merely indicates that these rights may be extended by the most favoured-nation clause of the Treaty of 1891. FRANCISATION OF NATIVE VESSELS. His Majesty's Government protest against the new matter introduced in ' Conclusions Compidmentaires,' P . 19. ,9 0 ? cIu f. ions Complementaires ' under this heading. The charge advanc ed against the British authorities in the East Africa Protectorate is absolutelyirrelevant to the question under what condition and in what circumstances franci- sat ion has been accorded by French Colonial authorities to native boats, and its introduction cannot be palliated by the reservation in the French ' Memoire ' and 11 Contre-M^moire ' of the right to supply ' indications compl^mentaires ' to the Tribunal on the subject. His Majesty's Government have learned with great surprise that the French Government offer to produce to the Tribunal two licenses to fly the Zanzibar flag granted by British authorities in the East African Protectorate to natives residing at SAr. His Majesty's Government are quite unaware of the existence of any such documents, and assert that no such practice prevails in the case of any British authorities in East Africa. If the licenses in question are produced to His Majesty's Government the circumstances will be strictly inquired into, and if it is found that such licenses were issued by any British official under cir cumstances in any way similar to those under which the French Colonial author ities have granted licenses to Suris, measures will promptly be taken to mark the sense of His Majesty's Government of the impropriety of any such conduct. In the meantime His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the assertion made on p. 19 of the 44 Conclusions Complementaires ' that such licenses have been issued, and protest against the attempt now made at the last moment to involve the Tribunal in an irrelevant inquiry of this sort. The statement made under this head is an absolutely new fact. RIGHTS OF POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TERRITORIAL WATERS. The British arguments founded on Article XLII of the Brussels Act were . „ (1) that this Article does not give, even - Conclusions Compi ^menta, res, ^ 21. to the Powers which ratify it, any power of police in the waters of other ratifying Powers, and fully recognizes and pre serves, as a rule of international law, the territorial sovereignty of these Powers, and (2) that as neither France nor Muscat was a party to the Artide, France could not be justified by the Brussels Act in making the claim to police or sur veillance in Muscat waters which was British Case, pp. 72,73. made in 1902. His Majesty's Government made no direct reference in the Argument to the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1873, having already dealt fully with that Treaty in the British Counter-Case (p. 33). In the Counter-Case it was necessary to deal with the contentions of the French ' Memoire ' (pp. 48, 56) as to the character and effect of this Treaty. His Majesty's Government see no ground for withdrawing the observations made as to the tardiness of the French objec tions to this Treaty, and without entering British Counter-Case, p. 33. j nto ^ technical question of ' prescrip tion ' mentioned in the ' Conclusions Compl^mentaires,' p. 21, submit that the fact that these objections were first put forward in this Case in 1905 affords a very strong argument against their soundness. His Majesty's Government repeat that whatever rights of search in Muscat waters Great Britain may have are conventional, and depend on the Treaties with Muscat now in force, including that «Conclusions Compi &amp;nentaires,' p. 21. 0 £ France appears to have mis understood the English decision in the case of Carr v. Francis Times and Co., quoted on p. 34 of the British Counter-Case , and reported in the 'Law Reports ( 1 002) Appeal Cases,' p. 176. That decision, reference to the text of which is invited, shows that the British authorities, in order to exercise the right to seize a British vessel in Muscat waters, obtained the authority of the Sultan. In view of the comments made at pp. 21—23 of the 'Conclusions Com- ptementaires ' on the British Argument (p. 26), with reference £0 the 13 C455FC&gt;14 Treaty of 1844, it is perhaps desirable to indicate again the exact nature of that argument. It was directed to the opinion of M. Renault, on which France so much relies. So far as concerns the interpretation oi the terms oU ^ntten docu ment, that interpretation must be the same both for Muscat and Zanzibar. But in so far as M. Renault expressed an opinion that usage or concession given to France in Zanzibar waters exclusive right of police over vessels under the French flag not expressly given by the Treaty, it became necessary to indi cate that proof of usage or concession by the Sultan of Zanzibar s inc e 1856 was m infer altos acta, so far as the Sultan of Muscat is concerned and in no sense established that the Sultan of Muscat had acquiesced in any such usage, or made any such concession. And His Maiesty's Government would observe, as to the statements on p 2^ of the ' Conclusions Complememaires, ' that the documents already before the Court do not indicate any exercise of rights of police by France in Oman waters before 1891, and that since that date disputes have been pending as to the matters now before the Tribunal for solution, and that there is no sign of acquiescence by the Sultan in the justice of the French claims. His Majesty's Government would also say, in conclusion, that they certain- J ly do not accept the French contention «'Conclusions Compi^mentaires,' p. 23. that the arrangements between France on the one side,and Great Britain and Germany on the other side as to jurisdiction in Zanzibar waters, have any effect whatever in Oman. CAPITULATIONS AND EXTERRITORIALITY. His Maiesty's Government cannot accept the theory propounded under this J head of the ' Conclusions Complemen- , ' Conclusions Compi^mentaires,' p. 25. taires ' that there is as between Christian and Mahommedan States any ' regime des Capitulations ' apart from agreement. No Power has or can have any jurisdiction within the territory of another Power, except by the consent of the latter. That consent may be evidenced by formal Treaties or Capitulations or by long continued usage, but the principal is the same in both cases. Any such powers can be exercised in the very nature of things only with the consent of the Government of the country m which they are claimed. The extent of the privileges of this nature enjoyed by foreign Powers differs greatly in different countries. There is no such thing as a general usage as to a ' regime des Capitulations.' The ' regime des Capitulations can have refer ence only to the terms which have been conceded by the Government of each particular country in which it is claimed. It is contended in the penultimate paragraph of the 'Conclusions Comple- mentaires ' under this head that reference ' Conclusions Compl^tnentaires,' p. 27. ^ be made to « usa g es ^ablis ' for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of exterritoriality enjoyed by an occidental Power within the dominions of an oriental Power. This is true if it refers to the usages which have grown up in that particular country in favour of the Power claiming the immunities; but is absolutely fallacious if it is meant to refer to a general body of usages capable of application to all such countries. His Majesty's Government would also remind the Tribunal that France invokes her theory of Capitulations in order to justify protection not of Chris tian Europeans, but of Mussulman Cmanis. The incident with reference to the Portuguese barque the ' Aurora, ' which was engaged in carrying contraband into Morocco appears to be quite irrelevant to the matters under djscussion, and it amounts merely to this, that the Go vernment of Morocco conceded to the Portuguese Government the same treat ment of its subjects as would have been extended to the subjects of any other European nation.But it may be observed that, according to the statement of the Case on p. 26 of the ' Conclusions Complementaires/' Portugal based her claim upon con sent as evidenced by usage. ' Cette reclamation etait basee sur le regime resultant de Tensemble des Traites passes par les Puissances avec le Maroc et dont, en fait, toutes les Puissances ont le benefice.' THE ZANZIBAR SUBSIDY. There appears to be nothing under his head calling for especial notice, and His Majesty's Government are content to ' Conclusions Co.npldmentaires.' p. 29. ^ ^ Tribunal to what has a l ready been said in the British Counter-Case, pp. 30 and 31, and to the standard work on Muscat, ' Aitchison's Treaties,' vol. xi, pp. 48, 72. Such liability to pay the subsidy as at present devolves on Great Britain does not, except as to amount, depend on Lord Canning's Award, under which the Sultan of Zanzibar is the debtor, but 'Treaties,' vol. xi, p. 72. depends on the terms on which the British Government undertook to pay the subsidy to the Sultan of Muscat, when in 1873 the Sultan of Zanzibar refused to continue it. 15 G C.

Mr. Graham to the Marquess of Lansdowne. — (Received July 26.) (No. 2.) My Lord, The Hague, July 25, 1905. I HAVE the honour to report, with reference to my despatch No. 1 of yesterday, tfeat the first meeting of the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal took place at 11 o'clock this morning. Besides the three Arbitrators, Messrs. Lammasch, Savornin Lohman, and Chief Justice Euller, and the British and Prench Delegates, there were present His Majesty's Minister, Sir H. Howard, and nearly all the other Diplomatic Representatives at The Hague, who constitute the Permanent Administrative Cbuncil of the Court of Arbitration. M. Lammasch, as President of the Tribunal, opened the proceedings in a brief speech. He referred eloquently to the progress of the idea of arbitration for the settlement of international difficulties, expressed his appreciation of the honour done to himself and to his colleagues by their selection as Arbitrators on the present occasion, and welcomed the British and Prench Delegates. He then declared the Court open. A recital followed of the names of the Secretaries appointed to the Tribunal, Messrs. Huyssenaers (the Secretary-General), Hoell, and d'Hauteville, and of the British and Prench Delegates. M. Euyssenaers then rose and referred to the Prench Supplementary Conclusions which had been received by the Court this morning, and on which I had the honour to report to your Lordship yesterday. It appears that the Prench Agent, finding the Court shut yesterday afternoon, had forwarded copies of these Conclusions direct to the three Arbitrators, an irregular proceeding, as all such communications should have been made through the Secretary-General. The President inquired whether the British or French Agent had any observations to make as to the submission of the Supplementary Conclusions to the Tribunal and whether there was any objection to their being accepted. I had prepared a brief statement on the lines indicated in my despatch of yesterday, which I proceeded to read to the Court. I urged that, in view of the unexpected nature of the action taken by the Prench Government, I should be given an opportunity of consulting your Lordship before the Tribunal arrived at any decision in the matter. I trust that the terms of this statement, copy of which is inclosed, will meet with your Lordship's approval. It seemed desirable to draw attention, in a friendly manner, to the irregularity of the Prench proceeding and to meet the objections to the form of the British Argument, which they adduced as the reason of their unexpected action. The Arbitrators retired to deliberate. After an absence of 20 minutes they returned, and their decision, copy of which is annexed, was read out by the Secretary. It was to the effect that, in view of Articles XLII and XLIII of The Hague Convention, the Court has decided to accept the Prench Supplementary Conclusions, but reserved to His Majesty's Government the right to reply either before or on the 1st August next. M. Lammasch then referred to the question of the language to be used before and by the Tribunal. He stated that the Court had decided that Prench and English might be used concurrently during the sittings, as had been already agreed, but that the proces-verhaux and sentence would be drawn up in the Prench language, with an official English translation. I inclose copy of this decision. At about midday the President declared the Court adjourned to Tuesday next, the 1st August, at 11 a.m. Copies of the proces-verhaux of the meeting will be forwarded to your Lordship as soon as they reach me. [2068 cc—1] ARABIA. (M uscat.) CONPIDENTIAL.In my despatch of yesterday I stated the opinion tbat the French Supplemen ary Conclusions, which have now been accepted by the Tribunal, m spite of tie e a 8 ^ and irregular manner of their submission, do not materially assist the Hrencn or affect the British Case. A further examination of the documents m question confirms this opinion. The new facts or arguments it contains can easily be met, and a reply should be prepared, as soon as possible, dealing very hnefly with the questions raised, but adducing no fresh facts, and giving the Erench no handle or the submission of further conclusions. The last word in the controversy will t us rest with His Majesty's Government, and the incident of the Supplementary^Con clusions, disclosing, as it does, a certain nervousness on the part of the -* j ^ enc ar ^ dissatisfaction with their own as compared with the British Cases, cannot but crea e an impression on the Tribunal, and react in our favour. 1 propose, subject to your Lordship's approval, to return to London to-morrow night with Mr. Craies. I would suggest that a Conference might be held on the following day, the 27th instant, at which a draft reply, now in course of preparation by Mr. Craies, might be considered. It is evident to me, from certain remarks made by the Arbitrators, that they are anxious to bring the proceedings to an early conclusion, and that they desire that our reply should be very brief, and should be submitted as soon as possible. _ I have endeavoured to ascertain whether oral arguments will be necessary, ihe question will not be definitely settled before the meeting of the 1st August next, but I gathered, in the course of private conversation with M. Savornin Lohman and M. Euyssenaers, that the Arbitrators are satisfied with the written Cases, and that it is extremely unlikely that oral arguments will be required. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) BONALD GrKAHAM. Inclosure 1 in -No. 1. Statement hy Mr. Graham. THE Erench Supplementary Conclusions were communicated to me yesterday evening. This is essentially a friendly arbitration, in which His Majesty's Government desire to meet the objections or wishes of the Erench Government in the most friendly spirit. But the action of the Erench Government in submitting Supplementary Conclusions on the day before the Tribunal meets has come as a complete surprise, and appears to be in contradiction with Article II of the 'Compromis' of October 1904, which stipulates that the Argument or Conclusions should be submitted within one month of the delivery of the Counter-Cases, unless the period is extended by mutual consent of the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal may, under Article III, call for further statements, but I am not aware that it has done so on this occasion. The British Argument was drawn up in full conformity with the provisions of Article II of the Compromis,' and is in the form adopted on previous occasions in the case of similar Arguments. It was of necessity somewhat elaborate, in view of the quantity of new matter imported into the Erench Counter-Case. The Argument has been in the possession of the Erench Government for a fortnight, but it was not until yesterday that we had any indication that the Erench Government objected to its form or desired to submit Supplementary Conclusions to the Tribunal. I have referred to my Government for instructions, and would respectfully submit to the Court that the consideration of the question should be deferred for a few days until I can receive a reply.

The Secretary-General opened the proceedings by reading aloud my letter of the y 29th ultimo, forwarding the reply of His Majesty's Government to the French Supplementary Conclusions, and a letter from the Prench Agent, requesting leave to attach to his delegation M. Eugene Ballero, Attache to the Erench Legation here, a request to which the Court had acceded. The President thanked me for the expedition with which His Majesty's Govern ment had prepared and delivered their reply. The manner in which they had met the wishes of the Court in this respect, and had thus facilitated its labours, had been much appreciated. The Erench Agent rose and stated that the Erench Government had, in principle, no observations to offer on the British reply, but that there were certain points of a general nature raised therein to which he desired to draw the attention of the Court, and that, unless an opportunity of doing so occurred during the course of the proceedings, he must request leave to make a brief statement. The President replied that the Arbitrators were perfectly satisfied with the written Cases, which had been drawn up in a thorough and masterly manner. They did not desire to put any questions or to hear any oral arguments. r _ Permission was then granted to M. Herbette to deliver his Statement, copy of which is inclosed herewith. It attempts to deal seriatim with the points raised in the British reply, and was read out sheet by sheet, copies of each sheet being at the same time handed to the Arbitrators and to myself. I have numbered these sheets for convenience of reference. During the delivery of No. 6, regarding the alleged grant by the British East Africa authorities to natives of Sur of licences to fly the Zanzibar flag, the President intervened, and said that the Court was doubtful whether these documents had any bearing on the question at issue. M. Herbette urged that they were relevant, as the natives to whom they were granted were Suris and subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. He was allowed to continue his Statement, judgment being reserved as to whether or not the licences might eventually be produced to the Court. The Arbitrators appeared to listen with some impatience to the Erench Agent's Statement. At its conclusion the President inquired whether I had any observations ^ to offer, in the evident desire that I should waive the right to answer. I did not, however, feel justified in doing so until we had had an opportunity of examining the French Statement more carefully, and I reserved the right to reply. M. Lammasch said that my reply must be delivered at or before the next meeting of the Court, which would be held at 10 a.m . the following morning. He was proceeding to adjourn the Court until then, when. I rose and pointed out that no decision had yet been reached regarding the Zanzibar licences. If they were to be admitted and produced to th Court, time would no doubt be allowed for His Majesty's Government to clear up the matter, and to furnish an explanation which the local authorities concerned had been called upon to supply. The Arbitrators, after a brief conversa tion, intimated that they had decided not to admit the production of the documents in question, which were accordingly handed back to the Erench Agent. The Court then adjourned until to-morrow. 1 have carefully examined, with Mr. Craies, the Erench Statement. Your Lordship will, I think, agree that it deals principally, if not entirely, with points which have been already thoroughly threshed out in the written Cases ; it adds little, &gt; if anything, to the controversy, and affords no material for an effective reply.

WITH reference to my despatches Nos. 5 and 6 of the 1st and 2nd instant, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith copies of the Protocols of the 2nd and 3rd Sittings of the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal.* The Protocols in question are very incomplete, and frequently inaccurate. The fact is that to follow the proceedings of the Court, which are conducted in French and English concurrently, and which often lead to somewhat desultory discussions, puts a severe strain on the capacities of the Secretaries, none of whom have any knowledge of the questions at issue, or belong to either of the nationalities represented on the Arbitration. The presence on such occasions of an official shorthand writer is to be desired. As your Lordship is aware, the Tribunal at its first sitting decided that the French text of the Protocols was to be the official and only authentic version of the proceedings. At the outset the Secretary-General asked me whether it would be necessary to include in the English translation of the Protocols English versions of the formal statements made by the French Agent. I replied that it would not be necessary, provided that any similar statements made by me appeared in English in the French official text. This course has since been followed throughout, and has apparently been acquiesced in by the French Agent. It was obviously more important (and even a useful precedent to establish) that statements made by the British Agent should appear in the official version of the proceedings in the language in which they were delivered, than that we should be supplied with a doubtful and, in any case, valueless English translation of the French Agent's statements.

Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from the British Agent, on the Maskat Arbitration, forwarding the Award delivered by the Tribunal.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that the Maskat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o'clock this afternoon, and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in Erench and English. As regards (A), the scope of the Declaration of 10th March 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Maskat of papers authorising them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— '(1) Before * * * * rules The date in question is that of the Ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. ' (2) Owners * * * * grantee'. « (3) After * * * * 1893'. The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new 'proteges ' was regulated and limited. As regards (B), the nature and the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows, and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdic tion of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— «(1) Dhows * ♦ * * 1844'. ' (2) The * * * * owner ' (3) Subjects * * * Maskat The results of the Award may be summarised as follows :— France may renew the licenses to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before 2nd January 1892. But no licenses given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bona fide French protege before 1863. This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French fla^-holders to the number of 10 or 12 at the utmost. Moreover, under Article 2 of i (B), the licenses in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other i dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that, if one 1 of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new license, must prove that he comes under the category of those who wereV bom fide Prench proteges before 1863. Such proteges must now be scarce, and the number of French flagholders should, in the course of a few years, be reduced to vanishing point. Under Article 1 of (B) dhows flyiug the French flag are declared to be inviolable in Maskat waters, and thus they are exempt from search. This decision is regrettable in view of the active participation of such dhows in the slave trade. But under Article 3 of (B) the owners, masters, and crews of the dhows, or their families, are expressly declared not to enjoy any such inviolability, and the moment they set foot in Maskat territory, they come under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. The Tribunal has definitely laid down that the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's sovereignty and jurisdiction would be in contradiction with the Declaration of 10th March 1862. This important decision will no doubt afford much satisfaction to the Sultan, and determines, entirely in His Highness's favour, the controversy regarding the three French-protected Suris who broke quaran tine in April 1903, the incident which in reality gave rise to the present Arbi- '' '^XTfer the Secretary-General had finished reading the Award, the President made a brief speech thanking the Agents and Secretaries for the manner in which they had assisted the Court, and then declared the proceedings at an end, I have, &amp;c., E onald G raham. v - O5 Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen In relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers'authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects, Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October 13, 1904, that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th of October 1903, Whereas in virtue of that Compromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty : Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America, and by the Government of the French Republic: Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Amsterdam, Member of the 2nd Chamber of the States General, Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article 1 of the Compromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire : Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the. University at Vienna, . Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly com municated to the Tribunal and to the Parties, Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the jtwo Parties ; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION : Wh areas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of article 5 of the Compromis of October 13, 1904 ' to declare ^ its comper tence in interpreting the compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law', and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890, relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags, Whereas by larticle 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of sup pressing slave trading and in the general interests of humaHity, irrespective | of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a state signatory of this Act I or not, and whereas at any rate France is in relation to Great Britain bound to | grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Whereas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act haye agreed ip its article 33 that the authority6 to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granie3 to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions:— 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons pro tected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed^ or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade, Whereas in default of a definition of the term ' protege ' in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Final Act, as to the piinciples of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice. Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers; a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitter*s-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the, sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose fla^ thev are sailing, ^ J Whereas since the restriction which the term 'protege' underwent rn virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 186=5 and 1860 especially- of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863 to which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received'the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term 'protege' embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1 0 . persons beino- subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2 0 . individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated m the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 186^ 3. persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as (&lt; proteijes ' hke those enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat Convention of 1044 and 4 . those individuals who can establish that thfey had been considered and treated as ' proteges ' by the Power in question befere the year in which the creation of new ' proteges ' was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the Status they had once legitimately acquired, J Whereas that although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exer cise of the pretended right to create ' proteges ' in unlimited number only in relation to Turlcey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States analogy havin^ always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regula tions ot the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous, • Whereas on the other hand the concession made by Turkey thai the staws of proteges ' be transmitted to the descendants of oersons. n/o m 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Lhnstian Power, carinot'be extended hv analogy to Muscat, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar the ' nro- teses of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality 'and religion different from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for French flags, are in ail these respects en tirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of iSi! apply only to persons who are bona fide in the service of French subjects but business' 50 ' 5 for ships-papers for the purpose of dcing any commercial8 2°. the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner ; o 0 . subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that tact any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Done at The Hague, in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, August 8, ^ ^ (Signed) H.

SENTENCE ARBITRALE DE LORD CANNING communlqufie sous forme de lettre 1 seyyid madjid, sultan de Z anzibar, et 1 S eyyid T houweyni, S ultan de M ascate. Beloved and Esteemed Friend, I address Your Highness on the subject of the unhappy differences which have arisen between Yourself and your Highness' brother the Imam of Muscat, and for the settlement of which Your Highness has engaged to accept the arbi tration of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Having regard to the friendly relations which have always existed between the Government of H M. the Queen and the Government of Oman and Zanzibar, and desiring to prevent war between kinsmen, I accepted the charge of arbitra tion between You, and in order to obtain the fullest Knowledge of all the points in dispute, I directed the Government of Bombay to send an officer to Muscate and Zanzibar to make the necessary enquiries. Brigadier Coghlan was selected for this purpose, and officer in whose judgment, intelligence and impartiality the Government of India reposes the utmost confidence. Bridadier Coghlan has submitted a full and clear report of all the questions at issue between Your Highness and your brother. I have given my most careful attention to each of these questions. The terms of my decision are as follows ; 1st. That His Highness Seyyed Madjid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of his late Highness Seyyid Said. 2nd. That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Muscat a sub sidy of 40,000 crowns. 3 rd t That His Highness Seyyid Madjid pay to His Highness Seyyid Thou weyni the arrears of subsidy for two years or 80,000 crowns. I am satisfied that these terms are just and honourable to both of you ; and as you have deliberately and solemnly accepted my arbitration I shall expect that you will cheerfully and faithfully abide by them, and that they will be carried out without unnecessary delay. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recogni tion of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither is it to be considered as merely personal between Your Highness and your brother Seyyid Thouweyni. It is to extend to your respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar and adjusting the inequality between the two inheri tances derived from your father. His late Highness Seyyid Said, the venerated friend of the British Government, which two inheritances are to be henceforward distinct and separate. I am, your Highness' sincere friend and well wisher, (Sd.) CANNING.

Reply on behalf of the Government of His Britannic Majesty to the Supple mentary Conclusions presented on behalf of the Government of the French Republic i and admitted by the Tribunal on July 25, igo$. His Majesty's Government at the outset venture to point out to the Tribunal that the criticism made in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions ' (p. 5) on .. the form of the British Argument is ntish ase, p.3- founded on a mistake. That Argument is framed in strict accord with the third paragraph of the English text of the ' Com- promis,' and with the precedents of the British Arguments in numerous cases of arbitration, among which reference may be made to the arbitrations as to the Alabama Claims (1872), the Behring Sea Seal Fisheries (1893), the Venezuelan Boundary (1899), and the British Guiana and Brazil Boundary (1904). In exercising the right of reply granted by the Tribunal on the 25th July, 1905, His Majesty's Government will confine themselves strictly to the points raised in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions,' so far as they seem to re quire any reply. INTERVENTION OF THE SULTAN IN THE ARBITRATION. In the ' Conclusions Complementaires ' (p. 7) an attempt has been made to „ , . ^ ,, . „ show that the Sultan has been unwillingly ' Conclusions Complementaues, p. y- , i • i dragged into the present case. Careful examination of the documents on which the French objections are made, which are printed on p. 40 of the British Counter-Case, will show that before the conclusion of the ' Compromis ' in October 1904, Great Britain and the Sultan were perfectly in accord as to the presentation of arguments as to French immunities in Oman, and that the letter of the 29th July, 1903, so far from being an unsuccessful attempt, embodied an accepted arrangement, while the letter of the 19th March, 1905, is merely an indication that the Sultan had not at his disposal any Agent competent to argue the case at The Hague, and (to quote his own words) 41 requested that His Majesty's Government would repre sent me and endeavour to gain my object (' et s'efforcer de gagner mon proems , ).' PUBLICATION OF UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. His Majesty's Government, upon the statements made under this head at lt _ , . _ ,, „ p. 9 of the' Conclusions Complementaires,*' ' Conclusions Complementaires. p. O. , , n , 1 , have only to observe that no more has been done than to call the attention of the Tribunal to what appears to His Majesty's Government to be the irrelevancy of a great many of the French alle gations and arguments. The document of the 14th August, 1901, given to Lord Lansdowne by M. Cambon, whatever its value, is, at any rate, directly relevant to the British Case. But the discussion of general British policy in Oman appears to His Majesty's Government not to be in issue under the ' Compromis/' and, whether the Agreement of 1862 be a diplomatic or a political document, there appears to be nothing in the ' Compromis ' which would justify an elabo rate review of British policy in the Persian Gulf. nTHE SULTAN'S NOTIFICATION.

His Majesty'^ Government have learned with great surprise that the French Government offer to produce to the Tribunal two licenses to fly the Zanzibar flag granted by British authorities in the East African Protectorate to natives residing at SAr. His Majesty's Government are quite unaware of the existence of any such documents, and assert that no such practice prevails in the case of any British authorities in East Africa. If the licenses in question are produced to His Majesty's Government the circumstances will be strictly inquired into, and if it is found that such licenses were issued by any British official under cir cumstances in any way similar to those under which the French Colonial author ities have granted licenses to Suris, measures will promptly be taken to mark the sense of His Majesty's Government of the impropriety of any such conduct. In the meantime His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the assertion made on p. 19 of the ' Conclusions Complementaires ' that such licenses have been issued and protest against the attempt now made at the last moment to involve the Tribunal in an irrelevant inquiry of this sort. The statement made sunder this head is an absolutely new fact. RIGHTS OF POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TERRITORIAL WATERS. The British arguments founded on Article XLII of the Brussels Act were ^ (0 that this Article does not give, even ' Conclusions Compl6mentaires,' p. a 1. , . r . 0 to the Powers which ratify it, any power of police in the waters of other ratifying Powers, and fully recognizes and pre serves, as a rule of international law, the territorial sovereignty of these Powers, and (2) that as neither France nor Muscat was a party to the Article, France could not be justified by the Brussels Act in making the claim to police or sur veillance in Muscat waters which was British Case, pp. 12, 73. made in j^ His Majesty's Government made no direct reference in the Argument to the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1873, having already dealt fully with that Treaty in the British Counter-Case (p. 33). In the Counter-Case it was necessary to deal with the contentions of the French ' Memoire ' (pp. 48, 56) as to the character and effect of this Treaty. His Majesty's Government see no ground for withdrawing the observations made as to the tardiness of the French objec tions to this Treaty, and without entering British Counter -Case, p. 33. into the technical question of ' prescrip tion ' mentioned in the u Conclusions Compl&amp;nentaires,' p. 21, submit that the fact that these objections were first put forward in this Case in 1905 affords a very strong argument against their soundness. His Majesty's Government repeat that whatever rights of search in Muscat waters Great Britain may have are conventional, and depend on the Treaties with Muscat now in force, including that ' Conclusions Compl^mefttaires, p. 21. of ^ France appears to have mis- understood the English decision in the case of Carr v. Francis Times and Co., quoted on p. 34 of the British Counter-Case , and reported in the 'Law Reports (1902) Appeal Cases,' p. 176. That decision, reference to the text of which is invited, shows that the British authorities, in order to exercise the right to seize a British vessel in Muscat waters, obtained the authority of the Sultan. In view of the comments made at pp. 21—23 of the ' Conclusions Com- plSmentaires ' on the British Argument (p. 26), with reference lo the 13 C455FD14 Treaty of 1844, it is perhaps desirable to indicate again the exact nature of that argument. It was directed to the opinion of M. Renault, on which France so much relies. So far as concerns the interpretation of the terms of a written docu ment, that interpretation must be the same both for Muscat and Zanzibar. But in so far as M. Renault expressed an opinion that usage or concession had given to France in Zanzibar waters exclusive right of police over vessels under the French flag not expressly given by the Treaty, it became necessary to indi cate that proof of usage or concession by the Sultan of Zanzibar since 1856 was res inter alios acta^ so far as the Sultan of Muscat is concerned, and in no sense established that the Sultan of Muscat had acquiesced in any such usage, of made any such concession. And His Majesty's Government would observe, as to the statements on p. 23 of the u Conclusions Complementaires, ' that the documents already before the Court do not indicate any exercise of rights of police by France in Oman waters before 1891, and that since that date disputes have been pending as to the matters now before the Tribunal for solution, and that there is no sign of acquiescence by the Sultan in the justice of the French claims. His Majesty's Government would also say, in conclusion, that they certain- ly do not accept the French contention 1 Conclusions Complementanes, ' p. 23. &lt; , 1 . ^ that the arrangements between France on the one side,and Great. Britain and Germany on the other side as to jurisdiction in Zanzibar waters, have any effect whatever in Oman. CAPITULATIONS AND EXTERRITORIALITY. His Majesty's Government cannot accept the theory propounded under this ' Conclusions Compl^mentaires,' p. 25. he . ad of the ' Conclusions Complfoien- taires, that there is as between Christian and Mahommedan States any 'regime des Capitulations ' apart from agreement. No Power has or can have any jurisdiction within the territory of another Power, except by the consent of the latter. That consent may be evidenced by formal Treaties or Capitulations or by long continued usage, but the principal is the same in both cases. Any such powers can be exercised in the very nature of things only with the consent of the Government of the country in which they are claimed. The extent of the privileges of this nature enjoyed by foreign Powers differs greatly in different countries. There is no such thing as a general usage as to a 'regime des Capitulations.' The ' regime des Capitulations' can have refer ence only to the terms which have been conceded by the Government of each particular country in which it is claimed. It is contended in the penultimate paragraph of the ^Conclusions Comple- Conclusions Compitoentaires,' p. 27- nientaires ' under this head that reference may be made to ' usages ^tablis ' for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of exterritoriality enjoyed by an occidental Power within the dominions of an oriental Power. This is true if it refers to tl^e usages which have grown up in that particular country in favour of the Power claiming the immunities; but is absolutely fallacious if it is meant to refer to a general body of usages capable of application to all such countries. His Majesty's Government would also remind the Tribunal that France invokes her theory of Capitulations in order to justify protection not of Chris tian Europeans, but of Mussulman Cmanis. The incident with reference to the Portuguese barque the ' Aurora, ' which was engaged in carrying contraband into Morocco appears to be quite irrelevant to the matters under discussion, and it amounts merely to this, that the Go vernment of Morocco conceded to the Portuguese Government the same treat ment of its subjects as would have been extended to the subjects of any other European nation./c *1^ b , e ? bserved that ' according to the statement of the Case on p. 26 of the Conclusions Complementaires,' Portugal based her claim upon con sent as evidenced by usage. ' Cette reclamation etait basee sur le regime resultant de 1 ensemble des Traites passes par les Puissances avec le Maroc et dont, en fait, toutes les Puissances ont le benefice.' THE ZANZIBAR SUBSIDY. There appears to be nothing under his head calling for especial notice, and ' Conclusions Complementaires,' p. 29. His Majesty s Government are content to , •, • , „ • • , ~ refer the Tribunal to what has already been said in the British Counter-Case, pp. 30 and 31, and to the standard work on Muscat, Aitchison's Treaties,' vol. xi, pp. 48, 72. Such liability to pay the subsidy as at present devolves on Great Britain does not, except as to amount, depend on Lord Canning's Award, under which ' Treaties,' vol. xi, p. 72. the Sultan of Zanzibar is the debtor, but u • • , ^ , depends on the terms on which the British Government undertook to pay the subsidy to the Sultan of Muscat, when in 1873 Sultan of Zanzibar refused to continue it.

Foreign Office to India Office. llth August 1905. Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from the British Agent, on the Maskat Arbitration, forwarding the Award delivered bv the Tribunal. Lord Lansdowne would be glad to be favoured with Mr. Brodrick's observ ations on this Award. I am, &amp;c., P. H. V illiees. Mr. Graham to the Foreign Office. No. 9. The Hague, , r , 8th August 1905. My Lord, I have the honour to report that the Maskat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o'clock this afternoon, and the Award, copy of w r hich is herewith annexed was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards (A), the scope of the Declaration of 10th March 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Maskat of papers authorising them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that '(1) Before * * * * rules ^ The date in question is that of the Ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant' her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. ' (2) Owners * * * * grantee'. ' (3) After * * * * 1893'. The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new ' proteges ' was regulated and limited. _ As regards (B), the nature and the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows, and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdic tion of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that ' (1) Dhows * « * * 184,^ '(2) The * * * * owner'. '(3) Subjects * * * Maskat'. The results of the Award may be summarised as follows :— France may renew the licenses to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before 2nd January 1892. But no licenses given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French fla^-holders to the number of 10 or 12 at the utmost. Moreover, under Article 2 of (B), the licenses in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that, if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new license, must prove that he comes under the category of those who were2 bond fide Prench proteges before 1863. Such proteges must now be scarce, and the number of French flagholders should, in the course of a few years, be reduced to vanishing point. Under Article 1 of (B) dhows flying the French flag are declared to be inviolable in Maskat waters, and thus they are exempt from search. This decision is regrettable in view of the active participation of such dhows in the slave trade. But under Article 3 of (B) the owners, masters, and crews of the dhows, or their families, are expressly declared not to enjoy any such inviolability, and the moment they set foot in Maskat territory, they come under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. The Tribunal has definitely laid down that the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's sovereignty and jurisdiction would be in contradiction with the Declaration of 10th March 1862. This important decision will no doubt afford much satisfaction to the Sultan, and determines, entirely in His Highness's favour, the controversy regarding the three French-protected Suris who broke quaran tine in April 1903, the incident which in reality gave rise to the present Arbi tration. After the Secretary-General had finished reading the Award, the President made a brief speech thanking the Agents and Secretaries for the manner in which they had assisted the Court, and then declared the proceedings at an end. I have, &amp;c., E onald G raham.5 Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the oultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to u 6 T T a . n ? er in which such P rivile ges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of liis Highness the Sultan over his said subjects, Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October l 3&gt; 1904, that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th of October 1903, Whereas in virtue of that Compromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty : Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America and ' by the Government of the French Republic; Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Amsterdam Member of the 2nd Chamber of the States General, Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article i of the Compromis to the King of Italy His Majesty has named Umpire ; Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, ' Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly coniT municated to the Tribunal and to the Parties, Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties ; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION : Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing s ' c h .grant 8 and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects c&gt;f His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan, c ^^ er ® as nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exercise ot this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of article 5 of the Compromis of October 13, 1904 ' to declare its compe tence m interpreting the compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked m the case, and in applying the principles of international law', and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890, relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags, Whereas by lartide 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of sup pressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a state signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate France is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Whereas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its article 32 that the authorityto fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions :— 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons pro tected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade, Whereas in default of a definition of the term ' protege' in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as w-ell to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Final Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice. Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested ^ by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the -strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing. Whereas since the restriction which the term 'protege' underwent m virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865, and 1869, especially of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term 'protege' embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2 0 . individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3 0 . persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as ' proteges } ' r like those enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat ConvenHon of 1844 and 4 0 . those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as ' proteges ' by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new ' proteges ' was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired, Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exer cise of the pretended right to create 'proteges' in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regula tions of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous. Whereas on the other hand the concession de facto made by Turkev that the status of ' proteges ' be transmitted to the descendants of persons who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended bv analogy to Muscat, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the ,s pro- t f4^ S ' of / he C 1 hr . lstian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality 'and religion different from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for French flags, are in ail these respects en tirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844. apply only to persons who are bona fide in the service of French subjects but business^ 50113 ^ ^ ^ ships ' papers for the P ur Pose of doing any commercial 600124 7 n Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on January 2, 1892, authorizations to fly the French flag to native vessels not satisfying the conditions prescribed by article 32 of this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France, FOR THESE REASONS, y DECIDES AND PRONOUNCE AS FOLLOWS : 1°. before the 2nd of January 1892 France wag entitled to authorize vessels belong ing to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; 2 . owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag - , retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3 • after January 2, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except f on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by France as her ' proteges ' before the year 1863; AS TO THE 2ND QUESTION, Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other treaties and by the practice resulting therefrom, Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of November 17, 1844, are, particularly in view of the language of article 3 ' Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes par des Fran9ais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de 1'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec 1'intervention du Consul de France'^ comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property, Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to article 42 of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds, Whereas according to the articles 31—41 of the Brussels Act the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner and therefore not transmissable or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner, Whereas article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Mascat f, que seront au service des Frangaise ' the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons and still less do thcmembers of their families, Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat would be in contra diction with the Declaration of March 10, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince, FOR THESE REASONS, DECIDES AND PRONOUNCES AS FOLLOWS *, 1°. dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French- Muscat Treaty of November 17,1844;2°, the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to ariy other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner • 3°. subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

(Cox).No. 454, dated Bushire, the 17th (received 26th) September 1905. From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. F raser , Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. &amp; In Foreign Department telegram No. 3118-E. A., dated 14th August, I was directed to submit my views with regard to the Maskat Arbitration Award after consultation with the Political Agent, Maskat. In my telegram of 24th August, I asked permission to delay my final reply pending receipt of the printed copies of the complete proceedings and their accompanying despatches. These documents have now reached me under Foreign Department endorse- n.. 3«.e.b.. toed 3 ,s, a** ,,03. r ntS noted ; and I have the No. 3395-E.B., dated eth September 1905. Honour to submit my views as directed. Meanwhile the Government of India have received Major Grey's letter Nos- 407 and 410 and copies of the memoranda of his views and their accompaniments, which he subsequently forwarded to me. 2. The full text of the preamble to the actual terms of the Award presents the latter in a much more favourable light than did the first telegraphic summa ries, and at all events places it beyond doubt that the Sultan's position is consi derably benefited by the result of the Arbitration; and that neither His Highness nor we have any reason to regret having committed the issue to the Tribunal. Apart from the last item of the Award which is of course most important, there are three points in the preamble to the Award which seem to me especially satisfactory— (1) That the Court have decided that France is bound, in the grant of her Flag, by the provisions of the Brussels Act, especially Article 32. {2) That they have decided that it is undeniable that the practice pursued by the French, facilitates traffic in slaves. (3) That they have given the French Government a very strong hint that they are morally unjustified in persisting in their reservation of Article 42 of the Brussels Act. 3. Were tfw present Ruler a stronger character and his administration more effective and civilised, and could we hope with any confidence that French Consuls and the French Colonial Party would be proof against temptation to cir cumvent them, then the terms of the Award would be all that we could reason ably want and the privilege of inviolability in Maskat waters with which the pro tected vessels have been endowed, would have been a consideration of minor im portance. As things are however the decision of the Tribunal on this point will, I be lieve, affect the results a good deal, and what past experience teaches me to fear is that as long as there are ten or a dozen flag-holders who can sail into Maskat Harbour, or cut defiantly across the bows of the ' Nur-el-Bahr' at sea under the French Flag, they will still ignore the Sultan, at Maskat, and will form a dis turbing leaven among the population at Sur. His Highness Seyyid Feisal is so prone to let things drift for the sake of a quiet life, that unless we are constantly vigilant in helping him to maintain his authority and improve his administration at Sur, it is possible that he may in spite of the terms of the Award, continue to allow the French Flag element to defy his local representatives and defraud him of his Customs revenues, sooner than have unpleasant half-hours with Consuls or Naval Commanders of the French Government. It remains to be seen what steps we can devise to prevent such a contingency.3 4. A great deal of course depends on the number of proteges who survive the Investigation of their claims to protection. In this connection Mr. Ronald Graham estimates 10 or 12. Major Grey thinks only 2, but judging from the list of names and approximate dates which he furnishes, there will be a good many more than that, who have received papers between 1863 and 1892. This can only be ascertained by thorough investiga tion, and the dates cannot be stated authoritatively pending Monsieur Laronce's return. 5. Then there are two points which I think might have been settled more explicitly in the Award, (a) As to whether there is any inheritable right to carry the Flag. (I gather from the terms of lines 9 and 10 from the bottom of page 6 of the Award that there is not). 1 (3) As to the manner in which the claims are to be investigated. Definite instructions on the latter point would have eliminated a fruitful source of difficulty. Thus, clause 3 of the first part of the Actual Award provides that the title to fly the Flag is conditional on the applicant being able to establish that he had been treated as a protege before 1863,— But establish before whom? 6. Lastly with regard to measures to be taken to make the Award effect tive — {a) Major Grey writes that the Sultan is averse to the issue of a procla mation at Sur; but I think this hesitation is only due to the fact that the Sultan had not then seen the complete Award and did not fully understand it. 1 quite agree however that any notification would be premature until the titles of all the claimants have been , investigated and decided. Once that is done, I am of opinion that the issue of a written notification explaining the Award is indispensable, and that it should not be left to the ignorant mercies of the Wali of Sur, a very humble person at present. If this course is not taken, the French Dragoman will be in a position to misrepresent the terms of the Award to the Suris to any extent, and keep alive their disaffection. What I fear is that owing to Monsieur Laronce's delay, all the French Dhows and their sea-going owners will have left Sur and be absent for the next six months. If that proves to be the case, I think the broad terms of the Award should be provisionally made known forthwith, and repeated in great detail later when the claims have been verified. ^ The notification might be issued by the Sultan in consultation with and '* with the concurrence of ' the Consuls of England and France and should specify the names of those persons entitled and those not entitled to fly the Flag on their Dhows, It should also contain the threat suggested by Major Grey that the use of the Flag by unauthorised persons or Dhows would be punished with the utmost rigour. {b) On Monsieur Laronce's return he will no doubt enter into communica tion with the Sultan or Major Grey. The first thing to be done is to see how many persons on the list the French are prepared to eliminate forthwith. The titles of the remainder should then be thoroughly investigated, and any case with regard to which the Consuls and the Sultan cannot come to an agreement, should be referred to London and Paris.(«) Next, a draft notification for the Sultan to issue should be drawn up and approved by both Governments. It should in clude a list of approved proteges. (m) Any doubtful points coming to light during the above negoti ations, such as the question of inheritable title, should be re ferred to London and Paris and authoritatively settled. (tv) It is presumed that any person found flying the French Flag unlawfully or running contraband under it, will be punished by the Sultan, if caught in Maskat waters. 7. I have the honour to offer two suggestions for the consideration or re consideration of Government— (?) That it should be decided between us that the creek which divides the two settlements of Sur, and which at high-water makes the Mugraimatein half almost an island, is within the territorial limits of Sur Town, and the French Flag shall not be flown there. If this is not done, cases of so-called violation of the flag during the tribal quarrels of the inhabitants will be likely to recur. (») That when we see what the result of the Award amounts to, after set tlement of titles and points of disputes, the question of the des patch of a Vice-Consul or Consular Agent to Sur after a con venient interval should again be taken into consideration, with a view to keeping the Sultan up to asserting his position there and realising his revenue. The presence of an intelligent officer would, I believe, materially conduce to the spread of civilising influence and to the reduction of the Sur community to order. His pre sence would at the same time encourage French Consuls to adhere to the terms of the Award and prevent flag-holders from assuming any unauthorised privileges on land. Q C.

PROTOCOL I. y. M eeting of T uesday J uly , 25 th , 1905. c The Tribunal assembled in open session at 11 a.m . at the Permanent' Court of Arbitration. The Arbitrators present were : Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University of Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, chosen Umpire by His Majesty the King of Italy; Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of chosen Arbitrator by the Government of His Britannic Majesty; T^ 0n ^ ieer Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior, former Professor at the free University of Amsterdam, chosen^ Arbitrator by the Government of the Prench Republic. The President spoke as follow : Only two months ago in this same building judgment was given by a* Court of Arbitration convened to decide a difference between Germany, Prance and Great Britain on one side and Japan on the other. It is only six months since, in accordance with Art. 9 of the Hague Con vention for the peaceful settlement of international differences, the report of an international Commission of enquiry was drawn up to pacifically settle a' difference most harmful and dangerous to the peace of the World. Hardly eighteen months have elapsed since a bitter disagreement—owino' to which the mournful sound of arms had made Itself already heard—between several Great European Powers and Yenezuela, a disagreement, from which there arose another between a certain number of the Powers nf fTio IMW &lt;f YouR E xcellencies and G entlemen, —cuiiu.

Best assured, Gentlemen, that we are entirely imbued with the sense of our responsibility towards the Governments and towards the great cause of the solution of mternational conflicts by means of judicial procedure. Each sentense of arbitration, which meets with the approval of those who are not implicated m the case ; and which perhaps not at the moment at which it is delivered, but after a certain length of time for thought and calm, meets even with the approval of the Party against which it is given, is a new pillar for this temple m course of construction of international Justice and of Peace. On the other hand a sentence which would deserve the approbrium of partiality, would imperil the task to which we have all devoted our enersies • the establishment of the rule of right and justice over Nations and Govern- ments. . . Ma y it be granted each of us, Gentlemen, to cooperate according to his position and his power with the aid of Him, who is All-Mighty towards that grand and sublime task.' He then requested Jonkheer L. H. Ruyssenaers, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands becretray-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, to act as Secretary- General of the Tribunal, and appointed as Secretaries of the Tribunal Jonkheer W. E/6ell, First Secretary of the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and Mr. Paul Grand d'Hauteville, Secretary of the Legation of the United States of America at The Hague. The Secretary-General then read the list of the Agents, Counsel and Secretaries of the different Delegations of the interested Powers, viz. : for Prance : Mr. Maurice Herbette, Second Secretary of Embassy, Agent, and Mr. Laronce, Consul of France, Secretary of the French Delegation ; for Great Britain : Mr. Ronald Graham, First Secretary in His Britannic Maiesty's Diplomatic Service, Agent; ^ ^ x * v' ■PIWll'iTHnnm !„■ I§5 Mr. W. P. Craies, Counsel, and Mr. George A. Mounsey, Third Secretary of the Legation of His Britannio Majesty at The Hague, Secretary to the Agent of the British Government. The Secretary-General declares that the Agents of the French Kepublio presented yesterday—in the name of his Government—supplementary Con clusions which have been delivered to the Members of the Tribunal and to the other Party. Mr. Ronald Graham asks for the floor and makes the following statement jn English : ' The French Supplementary Conclusions were communicated to me yesterday evening. This is essentially a friendly Arbitration in which HisjMajesty's Government desire to meet the objections or wishes of the French Government in the most friendly spirit. But the action of the French Government in submitting Supplementary Conclusions on the day before the Tribunal meets has come 3,9 a complete surprise and appears to be in contradiction with Art. II of the Compromis of October 1904, which stipulates that the Argument or Conclusions should be submitted within one month of the delivery of the Counter Cases, unless the period is extended by mutual consent of the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal may, under Art. Ill call for further statements, but I am not aware that it has done so on this occasion. The British Argument was drawn up in full conformity with the Pro visions of Art. II. ^of the Compromis, and is in the form adopted on previous occasions in the case of similar Arguments. It was of necessity somewhat elaborate in view of the quantity of new matter imported into the French Counter Case. The Argument has been in the possession of the French Government for a fortnight, but it was not until yesterday that we had any indication that the French Government objected to its form or desired to submit supplementary conclusions to the Tribunal. I have referred to my Government for instructions and would respectfully submit to the Court that the consideration of the question should be deferred for a few days until I can receive a reply.' The Tribunal retired to consider its decision. On the reopening of the session the Secretary-General read the following decision of the Tribunal : ' In accordance with the articles 42 and 43 of the Convention of The Hague pf July 39th, 1899, for the pacific settlement of international disputes, the Tribunal has admitted the filling of supplementary Conclusions presented in the name oE the Government of the French Republic, and re serves to the Representatives of the Government of His Britannic Majesty's the right to answer either before or at the meeting of Tuesday, August 1st, 1905. The Secretary-General read a letter addressed to him May 13th, 1905, by the Ministers of France and Great Britain at The Hague viz. : ' The Blague, May 13th, 1905. Monsieur le Secretaire-General, The Governments of France and Great Britain, in common accord and for special reasons, have decided to admit the use of the French and English languages respectively in the course of the pleadings of the ' Muscat ' Arbitration.86 The undersigned beg you in consequence to communicate that decisions to the Members of the Court. The President declares that the Tribunal in accordance with the above mentioned agreement has decided that the French language will be that of the Tribunal, with the right of the Parties to speak in English. He adds that the protocols and the sentence will be drawn up in Prench and will alone be of authentic value. They will however be accompanied by an official English translation. On the demand of the President the Secretary-General read the following decision of the Tribunal in regard to that question : ' Prench will be the language used by the Tribunal. However in conformity with the decision taken by the two interested Parties and communicated to the Trib unal by the Ministers of Prance and Great Britain at The Hague on the May 13th last, the two Parties will have the right to use the Prench and English language respectively in the course of the arguments. As regards to the Protocols and the sentence they will be drawn up in Prench, but accompanied by an official translation in English.'

PROTOCOL IV. M eeting oj 1 T uesday , A ugust 8th, 1905. The Tribunal met at 3 p.m. The President calls on the Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is follows : ' The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the Compromis concluded at London on October 13,, 1904, betwesn the Great Britain and Erance ; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Republic have thought it right by the Declaration of March 10, 1862 ' to engage reciprocally to respect 6 the independence ' of His Highness the' Sultan of Muscat, Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His High ness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorising them to fly the French Ffao- and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects' of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the iurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects. Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October 13,1904, that these questions shall be determined' by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th October 1903, Whereas in virtue of that Compromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty : Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America, and by the government of French Republic : Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Ams terdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States-General. 93 C473FDWhereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the 4ate of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article 1 of the Coqapromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire ; Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly com- munipated to the Tribunal and to the Parties, Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties ; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION : Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the indepen dence of the Sultan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exer cise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of Article 5 of the Compromis of October 3 3, 1^04 ' to declare its competence in interpreting the Compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law,' and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890, relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act,' are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags. Whereas by article 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of sup pressing slave trading and in the.general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a state signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate Prance Is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Whereas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its article 32 that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions: 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons pro tected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters out or owners, as w^ell as the captain of the vessels, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade. Whereas in default of a definition of the term ' protege ' in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Pinal Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice. Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the stric test surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured 94if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing. Whereas since the restriction which the term ' protege ' underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, I860 and 1869, especial ly of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty con cluded between Prance and Morocco in 1868, which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the terms ' proteg^ ' embraces in relation to ! States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2°. individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3° persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as ' Protege ' like those enumerated by article 4 oC the .French Muscat Convention of ISM and 4°. those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as ' proteges ' by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new &lt;e proteges ' was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the sfouws they had once legitimately acquired, Whereas that, although the Powers have expresses verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended righ t to create ' proteges ' in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous. Whereas on the other hand the concession de facto made by Turkey, that status of ,e proteges ' be transmitted to the descendants of persons, who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analo gy to Muscat, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the ' proteges ' of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality and religion diffe rent from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for Prench flags, are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas dispositions of article 4 of the Prench-Muscat Treaty of 1844 apply only to persons who are bond fide in the service of Prench subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships-papers for tbe purpose of doing any commercial business, Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on January 2, 1892, authorizations to fly the Prench flag to native vessels not satisfying the conditions prescribed by article 32 of this Act was not in con tradiction with any international obligation of France, POB. THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows : 1. before the 2nd of January 189^ France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly th« French flag, only boucd by her own legislation and admiuistrative rules; 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorised by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee ; 3. after January 3, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by France as her e( proteeres ' before the year 1868 ; AS TO THE 2nd QUESTION : Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is deter mined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other treaties and by the practice resulting therefrom, 95Whereas the terms of the treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Prance and the Iman of Muscat of November 17, 184)4, are, particularly in view of the language of article 3 ''Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes par des Frargais ou par des personnes au service des Fra^ais, ni les visiter sans le consentemeiit de I'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de France,' comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property, Whereas although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, whioh can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to article 42 of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds. Whereas according to the articles 31—41 of the Brussels Act the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner, Whereas article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat ' qui seront au service des Fraii9ais ' the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters and crews of dhows authorised to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons and still less do the member of their families, Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat would be in con tradiction with the Declaration of March 10, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince, r FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows : 1. dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to % the French flag are pntitled in the torn tonal waters of Muscat to the mviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treat v of .November ] 7, 1844 ; J 2. the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging tb the same owner; xi. -c?' s ' b i ects to t ! ie Sultanof Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to flv the r reach flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their fammes, do not enjoy m consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which could Z^uZ/r S0Vereignt ^ es P ec ially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the 1905^ One ^ ^ HagUe ' in the Purmaneut Court of Arbitration, August 8, (Signed) H. LAMMASCH. „ MELVILLE W. FULLER. A. F. DE SAVORNIN LOHMAN.' The President speaks as follows : •'The Award having been given, I only have to thank the Agents and Counsels of the two Parties for having assisted us by their thorough and exact exposition of the status causae et eontroversiae in their respective Memoranda 96and to thank the Secretaries, in the first place the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Jonkheer Huyssenaers, whose resignation is a loss of the most profound and grave importance to the Court and to its future work, and also the First Secretary of the International Bureau of the Court, Jonkheer Roell, who by the experience he has gained in these last years in the procedure of International Arbitration, will represent from now on the actual traditions of this Court. Our work being ended, I close the meeting.' The Secretary-General then gives Mr. Herbette, Agent of the French Republic, and Mr. Ronald Graham, Agent of Great Britain, the certified copy conformable with the Award of the Tribunal destined for their respective Crovernments. The meeting closed at 3-30 p.m. Done at The Hague, August 8th, 1905. The President : LAMMASCH. The Secretary-General : L. H. RUYSSENAEES.

Sir, Foreign Office^ August 14, 1905. WITH reference to the letters from this Department of the 31st July, 1903, and the 23rd February, 1905, and to your letters of the 1st March and the 18th July last, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at The Hague on the 25th July last and delivered its Award on the 8th instant. The three Arbitrators chosen to officiate on this occasion, under the Anglo-French Compromise of the 13th October, 1904. were Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America, as British Arbitrator; M. Savornin Lohman, ex -Minister of the Interior at The Hague and Member of the Dutch Second Chamber, as French Arbitrator; and Professor Lammasch, Member of the Austrian Upper Chamber, selected by the King of Italy to act as Umpire. His Majesty's Grovernment and the French Government decided that, in accordance with recent precedents, each of the three Arbitrators should receive for their services a fee of 1,000/., and that Messrs. Lammasch and Fuller should be reimbursed for any expenses of locomotion or maintenance incurred by them in connection with the arbitration. In the case of M. Lohman, who resides at The Hague, this latter provision was unnecessary. Messrs. Lammasch and Fuller were accordingly requested to furnish an estimate of their expenses. It was not, however, possible for them to do so until a decision had been reached as to how long the proceedings would last, and this point was on]y definitely determined during their final discussions. It was not, therefore, until Monday last, the 7th instant, that Lord Lansdowne received information from the British Agent on the arbitration, that Mr. Fuller estimated his expenses at 500/., and M.'Lammasch placed his at 200/. It is customary that the Arbitrators' fees, &amp;c., should be paid in to the Secretary- General of the International Tribunal on the morning of the day on which the final Award is delivered. This was fixed for the following afternoon, that of the 8th instant, and it therefore became necessary to authorize His Majesty's Minister at The Hague • by telegraph to pay into Court the British share of the sum involyed. A similar authority was telegraphed to the French Minister at The Hague by the French Govern ment, and the total sum necessary, viz., 3,500/., was paid over to tl^e Court on the Sth August by the British and French Ministers acting simultaneously. A receipt was given by the Secretary-General for the British share, viz., 46,250 fr. (1,850/.). I am to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will grant their sanction to this expenditure. Their Lordships are aware from the correspondence which passed in February last, that in addition to the 250/. granted to Mr. W. F. Craies for preparing the British Case, it is necessary to provide further remuneration for his services in drawing up the British Counter Case and Argument. These documents were prepared with much skill and to the entire satisfaction of His Majesty's Government. Lord Lansdowne would suggest, for the consideration of the Lords Commissioners, that Mr. Craies should receive an inclusive fee of 100 guineas for the preparation of the Counter Case, and of 150 guineas for preparing the Argument. I am to request that, if their Lordships agree, sanction may be given to the payment to Mr. Craies of the sum of 250 guineas at as early a date as possible. I am. &amp;c. (Signed) F. H.

The French -i Acting _ Consul at Muscat had therefore been instructed to inform the Sultan and His Majesty s Consul that the status quo would be maintained until after the arrival of M. Laronce, who, furnished with the necessary instructions, would reach his post by the September steamer. Action had been taken accordingly. The French Government had considered that the maintenance of the status quo naturally carried with it the temporary renewal of the navigation licences previously granted, and the French Acting Con sul at Muscat had consequently been-authorized to once more prolong the papers of all the French proteges. Moreover, the above measure would not in any way prevent the Arbitral Award being eventually applied in its entirety, but the inquiry which was indispensable in order to rectify the final list of French dhow-owners, in conformity with the principles laid down, must necessarily entail a certain delay, and it did not appear to be possible to permit the dhows to commence their winter season under conditions which were wholly irregular and without maintaining some control for the repression of the Slave Trade. The _ French Government hoped that His Majesty's Government would appreciate the practical and conciliatory nature of the above measures and would agree to them. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.

Further, that the French Government hare m the meantime granted to all the French proteges temporary renewals of their licences. This measure will not, however, prevent the Arbitral Award from beW eventually applied in its entirety. L( f d Lansdowne is of opinion that the request of the French Government that there should be some delay in order to enable them to carry out the investigations rendered necessary by the Award is a reasonable one. It is, moreover, desirable to be as conciliatory as possible when so much depends on the spirit in which the French apply its terms. His Lordship is therefore prepared, if Mr. Brodrick sees no obiec- tion, to agree to the French proposal. There does not, however, appear to be any reason to delay the application of the final clause of the Award. Lord Lansdowne proposes therefore, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to inform M. Geoffray, in agreeing to the French proposal, that, as the Award lays down that French flagholders who are subjects of the Sultan and their crews and families do not enjoy any right of exterritoriality, it is understood that they have now come, as a matter of course, under His Highness' sovereiffntv and iuris- diction.

[The Agreements dated October 13, 1904, and January 18, 1905, were published in ' Treaty Series No. 3, 1905.'] Mr. Graham to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received August 9.) My Lord, The Hague, August 8, 1905. I HAVE the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o'clock this afternoon and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards («), the scope of the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— ' 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules.' The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. ' 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee. ' 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of Hip Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her 'proteges' before the year 1863.' The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new ' proteges ' was regulated and limited. As regards (6), the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— ' 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. ' 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. '3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in consequence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.' The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. Moreover, under Article 2 of (6), the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must [1008] B 2 ( IpK.6 (Official Translation.) Meeting of Tuesday, August 8, 1905. THE Tribunal met at 8 p.m. The President calls on the Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is as follows :— The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the ' c Oompromis concluded at London on the 13th October, 1904, between Great Britain and Prance; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the Erench Hepublic have thought it right by the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, to engage reciprocally to respect the independence ' of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat; • - i i.- Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen m relation to the issue, by the Erench Bepublic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the Erench flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to^ the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects ; . Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the ' Compromis ' of the 13th October, 1904, that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of Article I of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th October, 1903 ; Whereas in virtue of that ' Compromis ' were named as Arbitrators— By the Government of His Britannic Majesty, Mr. Melville W. Euller, Chief Justice of the United States of America ; And by the Government of the Erench Republic, Jonkheer A. E. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the Eree University at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States-General; Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of Article I of the Compromis ' to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire: Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament; Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases, and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties ; Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supple mentary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; As to the first question; Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the Erench flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan; Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by Treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of Article XLVIII of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of the 29th July, 1899, and of Article V of the 'Compromis' of the 13th October, 1904, u to declare its competence in interpreting the ' Compromis' as well as the other Treaties which may be invoked in the Case, and in applying the principles of international law,' and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of the 2nd July, 1890, relative to the African slave trade, especially to Article XXXII of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags; Whereas by Article XXXII of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers totheir ,^ a ^u 0 native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave- for thf flatmavhflo^f irres P ective of wh ether the applicant rate Fmnof \ ^ Y ^ tate + «. or y of this Aet or not, and whereas at any rate i ranee is m relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flao- only under the conditions prescribed by this Act; 0 oni ^ unaei tne . ^ ^ ereaS % ln A 0r , d ?

Before the 2nd January, 1892, Prance was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Prench nag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; 2. Owners of dhows who before 1892 have been authorized by Prance to ny the Erench flag retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, Prance was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Prench flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by Prance as her ' proteges ' before the year 1863. As to the second question :— Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other Treaties, and by the practice resulting therefrom; Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Prance and the Iman of Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, are, particularly in view of the language of Article III, ' Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer^ dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes par des Prangais ou par des personnes an service des Prangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Toccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de Prance,' comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property ; Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of Prance to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels, and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the Prench flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to Article XLII of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds; Whereas according to the Articles XXXI—XL! of the Brussels Act, the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner, and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner ; Whereas Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat ' qui seront an service des Pranyais ' the same protection as to the Prench themselves, but whereas the owners, masters, and crews of dhows authorized to fly the Prencli flag do not belong to that class of persons, and still less do the members of their families; Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, would be in contradiction with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, by which Prance and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince; Por these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the Prench flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the Prench-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844 ; 2. The authorization to fly the Prench flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the Prench flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

His Highness showed me an Arabic translation ~ ' ~ ' ''I of the document noted in M Protocole IV. Seance du mardi A the margin which he had le 8 Aout 190o.' (Enclosure received from the French in Foreign Department letter Consul the previous day of 11th August 190.5), ___J with enclosure (2), and asked me to compare it with the original.- I did so, and found, two serious mistakes in the translation which it appeared necessary to correct without delay- I therefore wrote to Mon sieur Laronce the letter attached (enclosure S), and sent him the translation. Within an hour I received his reply (enclosure 4) with the translation corrected in accordance with my sugges*- tions.. I then returned the document to His Highness. 4*- The French translation of the Arabic passage quoted in my letter to Monsieur Laronce is as follows : - ^'Considerant que les dispositions de 1 * article 4. du 'Traite Franco-Mascatais de 1844- s'appliquentaux personnes 'qui demandent des titres de navires dans le tout d'exercer 'quelque commerce.' The gravity of this mistake is at once apparent, and I am afraid that it is very doubtful indeed whether an error in copying is the whole explanation. However that may be, there can be no doubt with regard to mistake (2) the meaning of ^ J here is 'in this connection' and the meaning is intended to be obscure and; to raise doubts in the mind of the reader► It will be observed that this error also occurs in the French Consul's letter to the Sultan, and that the word ing of that letter tends generally to disturb his feelings in regard to the interpretation of the terms of clause 6. of the award► I have explained to him that the matter will be clearer when an arrangement has been arrived at regarding the names of persons00183 persons now authorised t.o fly French flags, pending which he could scarcely t»ake very decided st»eps tiO st»rengtJien his authoritiy in any casej buti X infer from, t/he actions of the French that they intend to give all the trouble possible in connection with the application of the final clause of the award- ~ co Py of this letter will be forwarded to the Secretary to the aovernment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta.

After Compliments, I have the honour to send to Your High ness,. with this letter, all the papers relating to the sentence pronounced 'by the Hague Arbitration Tribunal on the 8th August last in connection with Muscat Dhows. The Government of the French Republic intend fully to carry out that sentence, and hope that the statement thereof is (clear) enough to enable the difficulty to be unravelled according to the settlement. My High Government has given me permission to explain to Your High ness that, according to the last clause of the said sentence, she will regard from to-day that those of your subjects who are the owners or masters of dhows authorised to fly French flags, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families do not possess in this connection right of ex-territoriality, and are not exempt from Your Highness* sovereignty and Jurisdiction. So the hope of my Oovernment is that when I send such a person to your court that person should be treated with Justice and equity always, whenever he comes to your court, and that such persons should enjoy special consi- d^ation^and Just dealing on account of the French flag so that tyranny ov oppression or retaliation should come upon them. The persons coming under this category must be Your Highness' subjects born in Oman only; as regards Arabs who can prove French title^ or (themselves to be) French subjects, they will always remain under the protection of the French Consul at Muscat.

On t»he 7t&gt;h Instisunt., t.he ^ench Consul infonued me uhat. he had received inst&gt;ruotiions from his Government, t^o announce t.o His Highness t,he c; &gt;u3t»an tihati, in accordance wit.h clause six of 'Ohe Hague Arbitration award, those subjects of His Highness who eure authorised to fly ^ench flags are not in future, to oe considered as having been removed, in consequence of that fact, from his sovereignty and jurisdiction. Monsieur Laronce suggested that he should wait until the end of the fasting month of Rainzan before taking action, out I replied that in my opinion it would be better to save further delay by making the announce ment at once. On the 10th Instant I received from my colleague the letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report, and which I briefly acknowledged on receipt. From, Po,j?,- On t»jpie morning of t»he }3tfli Inst^ant;, I paid a visit* t,o t.he Su!J t»an. His Highness showed me an Arabic •oransla'olon of - t»he documen'&amp; not»ed In t»he 'Prot-ooo!! e IV.

I t&gt;herefore wrote t»o Monsieur Leironce t»he letter attached (enclosure ^), and sent him the translation. within an hour I received his reply (ftnc?osure 4) with the translation corrected in accordance with my suggestions. I then returned tne document to His Highness. 4.- f ?he French translation of the Araoic passage quotedi in ray letter to Fonsleur Laronce is as follows : - 'Oonslderant que Tes dispositions de 1'article 4 du 'Tralte Franco-Mascatals de 1844 s'appliquent aux personnes 'qui demandent des titres de navires dans le out d'exercer 'quelque commerce.' 'Phe gravity of this mistake Is at once apparent, considerable portion of the paragraph has been omitted in copying. ^ith regard to the second error, the meaning of Ijiz? J here is 'in this connection', which expression raises an oovious doubt in the mind of the reader. It should be 'on this account', or preferably, as recommended by me to Monsieur Laronce. I observed that this mistake occurs also in the French Consul's letter to the Rultan (enclosure 2) and that the woxMing of the letter tended to disturb his feelings in regard to the Interpretation of the terms of clause 6 of the award. After much consideration I was driven to the conclusion that the letter in the form in which it was sent to His Highness could not have emanated either from the French Government or from I onsieur Laronce andi ^ 00189 and on t.he morning of t»he 14t»h Instiant, tiook tihe Sultan's copy tio t.h^ PVanch Grnsu3at.e y and asked my colleague whet.her it» was a corrects tiranslat»ion of itis French original# He appeared t»o be surprised at» my question, but» at» once produced t&gt;he French version, and we found, as I expected, t»hat» lt» had been misT*rans- lat.ed. Monsieur Laronce suggested t»hat» he should call his Arao dragoman Abd-ul-Aslz ur Rawahl ; and that, we should make a translation together. I readily agreed,and the result was another Arabic letter,(of which enclosure (R) Is an English translation), which was duly sent to the Sultan by my colleague, in lieu of that first -addressed to him* A translation of His Highness* reply is also attached, enclosure (6), I Monsieur Laronce Informed me that the translation of the 'Protocole' above referred to was made in Paris and not locally, and I believe the second mistake in the Sultan's copy thereof, which was In the original, to be due to a clerical error very easily made, namely the substitution of the word ^ for [jj' . Beyond this the translation is very ^ood, T^he error in copying however, and the mistranslation of the letter to His Highness the Sultan are the work of ADd~ul-Aziz , and it is not easy to believe that they were unintentional, Monsieur Laronce announcel to me his intention to reprimand the dragoman for his csurelessness, and apologised himself for not having read the documents more attentively before despatching them; he moreover suggested that in case of any further diffi culty of this nature, I should act as X had done on the present occasion.

Second, the status of dhows while in Oman ports at anchor. I contend that when the anchor drops the inviolability ceases. Third, the French Consul holds that in cases of a quarrel between the master and crews of dhows while at sea, ■ (or between the crews themselves), the matters should be refer- -red to him after the return of the vessel, for settlement; I maintain that this sjnounts to the withdrawal of the persoms concerned from the Jurisdiction of the SMltan.

Sir, With reference to letter No.S868 E^B. dated 17th October 19Qa from the Secretary to the .Sovernment of India in the Foreign tepartment to your address and suhsequert correspon dence, I have the honour to submit the following report in con nection with the settlement of the French Flag question accord- ing to the Arbitration award. S -~ Monsieur Laronce and £ held our first two confe rences on the 2nd and 6th Instant. On the first occasion we confined our attention to discussing the terms of the award them selves, and the points upon which we differed were submitted by me to the Government of India on the following day in a. telegram of which a copy was sent to you. Monsieur Laronce agreed to the suggestion that a proclamation announcing the result of the arbitration a hould be issued by His Highness the Sultan, and we will forward in due course to our respective government, a draft ^or approval. Tlle proclamation should in my OBinlon -e terms of the award, in order that the Omanis concerned may W. definitely the extent of their privileges in future, hence from one point of view, the desirability of accord in interpretation. ' t0z,- In our second conference xhe persons wiio were hencef ort.h t.o f ly French Flags were discussed. Firs't/, Monsieur Laronce informed me 'Lhati on IStJi May 1904L an agreementi was signed between London and Paris in regard 'Do 'Dlie recognit.ion by His Majesty's .Government/ of prot.ect.ion being afforded by France t»o 25 Arabs of Zanzibar^ and gave me a list, of six of tihese who, he ga-M , are in -che habit, of visiting Oman, and must, be considered, as proteges of France in this neighbourhood as they are in Zanzi bar. I attach a memorandum in connection with these individuals, and it is interesting to note that Monsieur Ottavi, who is at present French Consul at Zanzibar and presumably is responsible for the compilation of this list of 25 names, was from 1894 to 1901 representative of his Government at Muscat, and must be aware that four of these sir persons are subjects of the Sultan of Oman. Monsieur Laronce then produced the list of flag- holders placed by his Government before the Hague Tribunal with their counter case. He Informed me that all the owners of dhows included therein were believed to have received their authorisa tion to fly the flag in the first instance from one of the French colonies between 1863 and 1392; ajnd that enquiries were being made of which he hoped before long to furnish me with the result. From local reports it would appear that several had obtained their papers first from Monsieur Ottavi in Muscat, but the posi tion is a difficult one as no doubt the French would produce documentary evidence from their colonial registers if required to do so, This matter X hope to go into more fully when my collea gue furnishes me with the dates and records In connection with t.his list.. • nr-p now delayed, pending an agree- g _ Our nagociataons are no^ u.excuj concerning 'Ohe int»erpret»a— ment being arrived at upon the points concern „ referred by me in my telegram of tion of the terms of the award relerrea y . ^ the receipt by Monsieur Laronce of further the Srd Instant, and the receipt j -w-i tvi The list of French flagholders. information in connection—-=- rmi ' 11 M E M 0 R A N L II M. 00217 / 1/ 1.- The firs'O name given t.o me by Monsieur Laronce is Mahomed bin Saleem bin 'Abud A1 .Ghailani^ This man is a subject, of t.he Sult,an of Muscat, he was born at.

Sir, I have the honour t,o refer to telegram Mo.2&amp;6 E.B. dated 18th Instant from the Government of India in the Fore, gn Department, and to this Office letter No.SIS dated lath June 1900 which was forwarded to -Government by Lieut: Colonel Kemball with his. letter No. 180 dated SOth idem. 2.- In paragraph £ of the letter to which attention ■V; ' '' i is invited' my predecessor states on the authority of His High ness the Sultan, that the French flag holders received no pro tection papers beyond the tltres de navigation.. His Highness assures me that these titres were in fact the only authorisation papers ever issued to them. According to Monsieur Laronce,. whenever an Arab presented himself at a French Consulate or colonial office and asked for a flag and titre de navigation he was given t,hem on payment of T,he sum demanded, provided that he satisfied t,he conditions specified by Major Cox in tJie same paragraph of his let/oer. Should the applicant already have been in possession of a titre for one•vessel he was granted one for another without question, his name having been registered as a Stench 'protege' on his first application^ These titres dede navigation were renewed yearly, as a rule at. t.lie office from which the original had been obtained,, but., in the event of the owner or master of a dhow being unable to appear at that office on the expiry of' the year, upon his presenting himself at- another colony or Consulate,, either (1) a note of ,, prolongation ,, was made on the reverse of his titre to cover the period required for him to reach his 'port d' attache' (vide enclosure 8: to Major Gox &gt; s letter under reference), (2) the same titre was made tenable for ajiother year, or (S) a 'renouvellement' was given by the officer in charge of the colonial or Consular office at which the applicant appeared*. I enquired from Monsieur Laronce as to the view taken in cases where the owner or master of a dhow had either neglected or been unable to present himself at any Consular or colonial office on the expiry of the year* He replied 'Tant pis pour eux'. I suggested then that in such a case, should the dhow suffer injury after the expiration of the period specified in the titre,the owner would not be in a position to apply to the French Ciovern- ment for assistance. Monsieur Laronce replied that certainly he would if he could produce his old paper, or at least prove that he was a French 'protege'! It is well here to notice briefly the issue of titre number M.H (enclosure .8 to Major Cox's letter).. My predecessor remarks that Rashid bin Khamis must have had French papers before and let them lapse,, thereby reverting to his original status as a subject of the Sultan of Oman* He may have let his titre lapse, but from the French point of view the fact of his having done so would not have affected his status as a protege''. 5*- Qur difficulty then is that it is impossible to as certain where and when each owner first obtained his registration as a French protege, and authorisation to fly the flag / except from the French colonial and Consular records themselves, as all the titres de navigation granted before 1892 have long ceased to exist and we are now paying the price of having allowed this abuse to remain for so long practically uncontested^00248 Eft regard t.o t.he refplacement/ of existing dhows by authorised flagholders, I suggest. 'Ghat,, now t.hat. there is a prospect, of t»he number and names of such persons being defini tely established, that all question of their possessing any right of exterritoriality which would exempt them from the jurisdiction of their lawful sovereign has been removed, and that the authorisations,, at the most,,, are peculiar to the per sons concerned during their lifetime only and are not to be inherited,, it does not sum to matter very much either from the point of view of His Highness the Sultan or from that of His Majesty's Government whether the authorisation is held to be general,, and a limited number of dhows allowed to be maintained and replaced during the lifetime of each owner4, or whether the authorisation is held to be strictly limited to specific dhows. Not only does a dhow ordinarily last for a large number of years but it must be remembered that it would be extremely difficult for His Highness to prove to the satisfaction of the French Consul that any particular vessel had ceased to exist and had been replaced- Every effort would be made not only by the owner himself but also by the French officials on his behalf to conceal the fact,, and it would not be likely that the Sultan would care to proceed against the owner without substantial' proof of his guilt, for more reasons than one. Qn the other hand the death of an owner is impossible to conceal for any length of time, and His Highness would have no difficulty in punishing any subject of his in whose possession one of the deceased man's dhows was found should it be sailing under a French flag. For these as well as other reasons I beg respect- fully to reiterate the suggestion Submitted for consideration in my telegram of January ith. 5- Monsieur Laronce informs me that he has not yet received all the information respecting the French list which ^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said was still awaited 80 ae0 aS HOVember 8tt - « ^ Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the list put in by the a-ench with their countercount,er case befor^e t.h.e liague Tribunal practicaliy as iti stands, it. will not. be necessary to wait, for further information and much time will be saved» It is unliirely that any names will be eliminated by the French, who after making all possible delay, will produce documentary evidence to support the claim of each owner to authorisation- Otherwise,. I beg to suggest that the French Government be pressed to expedite the collection of the required particulars, as the proclamation to be issued by the Sultan should contain an accepted list, and the French are quite aware of the fact that they have nothing to lose by delaying the issue of the proclamation. 6»- Monsieur Laronce remarked to me that there are some dhow owners possessing authorisation to fly the French flag whose names are not in the list referred to above. X trust that it will be possible to decline to allow the claims of such persons to be considered. 7.- A copy of this letter -is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.

Muscat., 12t,h March 1906. Sir, X have -ohe honour t,o make a further report, in connec-Dion with t.he negoclations now in progress between the French Consul at Muscat and myself with a view to the settle ment of the French Flag question in accordance with the judg ment of the Hague Tribunal. 2 *~ 1 have carried out the instructions contained in the telegram of'March 1st from the Government of India in the Foreign Department. On March ^rd I explained to Monsieur Laronoe t-he conclusions t,o which His Majesty's Government, have arrived in regard T.o points (2) and (5) submiT,T,ed ^ them. My colleague accepted those conclusions and in accordance with a request from him,I addressed to him on the 4th Instant, the letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report. He informed me later in the same day that,, in sending a copy of my letter to his .Government, he had testified to the spirit of concilia tion exhibited by me in connection with these negociations. 0h t ' he ^ Instant I received from M. Laronce enclosures (2) and (8). The first point to be noted as regards the list is that 11 of the owners names which appeared in the ^Frenchl^rench Count/er Case list, have been elimina'Oeci by M. Laronce- This is sat.isract.ory so far as it goes.. One new name has been put in,, No,16, which my colleague says was accidentally omitted from the former lists* This is probably the explanation,, aa from enquiries which I have made it seems that he has a claim to authorisation,, and I do not propose to object to his inclusion.. The last six names on the list (17 — 22) are those submitted with my letter No. 568 dated 16th December 1905 and two days ago I received the instructions of Government in regard to their position. It will be seen from M. Laronce's letter dated 8th Instant, enclosure (4), which was addressed to me subsequent to a discussion on the 7th,, that his view is that the status of these persons having been decided by the agreement of lJ5th May 1904, it should not now be disputed* He claims, moreover,, that owners Nos*8 &amp; 155 having been born in the Comoro Islands should be considered as Rrench proteges in Oman.- I hope to come to an agreement with him in these matters during the present week and will submit the result by next mail. The next point to be considered is a serious one, it is that which is connected with my telegram to you of the 8th March.. M* Laronce makes the total number of dhows to be protected 5,1. From enquiries made by me recently I came to the conclusion that several of the owners did not possess the number shewn against their names in his list, and in consequence suggested that His Highness the Sultan should make enquiry at Sur., However on the |9th Instant owner No*4 Salem ben Selim oued Sehele (French spell ing) arrived in Muscat and was interrogated by the Sultan and myself. This man knows all the persons named in the list and gave us the number of dhows owned by each with further parti culars,, which I have shewn in column 6. added by me to M. Laronce' list.. I will discuss this question also with my colleague during the week and will endeavour to come to some agreement. It. will be observed that M.. Laronce regulates the claim of each owner to authorisation by the date of the issue to him of his first titre de navigation; and his view is that a man00260 a man having received one t.it»2?e prior x»o 2ncL January 1392 should be allowed t-o retain aut»horisat.ion for all or any dhows for which he subsequent^ly otroained t.it»res up t»o t.he present, tiime. This is one of 'Dhe t»wo Questions which I have already submit/oed with my suggestions for settlement, the other is that of the replacement of authorised dhows during the lifetime of the owner► I beg to repeat that in my opinion the concession offered by Monsieur Laronce, that of the inviolability of French protected dhows ceasing on their entry into the Sur creek, is not equal to the two which are asked from His Majesty's Govern ments M» Laronce asks me to say that His Government attach very great importance to these two points. 5.- .A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Tepartment.

Muscat,,. &lt;£t,h March 1906. Sir, In accordance wit,h the arrangement, made verbally between us yesterday,. I have the honour to communicate to you officially the conclusions arrived at by i±is Majesty's (xovern- ment upon the points referred to them by me some weeks ago in connection with the negociations now proceeding between us. These conclusions are as follows:- (1). His Majesty's Government are of opinion that according to the judgment of the Hague Tribunal the inviolability of a dhow protected by the French Flag does not cease even when at anchor in an Oman port. ( 2 )« Should a subject of the Sultan of' Oman belong ing to a French protected dhow be accused of crime on the high seas. His Majesty's Government do not consider that there would be any objection to the transhipment and transportation of such person to a French port for trial,&gt; even should it be necessary to land him temporarily in the Sultan's dominions, pending arrangements teeing made with such object in view. In the opinion of my Government however, such cases could not be tried by the French Consul in Oman without Monsieur Larohce, Consul for France, M U S G A T.wit.hout» infringement, of t.he liague award; and 'Ohey hold t.hat. according vo t,he decisions of t-he 'Oribunal, in the case of Omanis,, all difficult-ies and disputes which may occur bet-ween the owners, masters, and crews of French protected dhows,, ashore or afloat, should be decided by iiis iiighness, except as provided for above. 2.- We agreed to postpone the discussion of the question of the replacement of dhows which had received authori sation to fly the French flag befbre 1892 until the list of such dhows and their owners had been made out, and you kindly pro mised to supply me with such list as ..^oon as possible.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.-lOl dated 12th Instant, I have the honour to report further upon the negocla- tions in progress for the settlement the French Flag question. 2.- At an interview on the 16th Instant,I communicated to Monsieur Laronce the views of' His Majesty's Government upon the status of owners Nos^lT — 22 in the list forwarded with my letter referred to above- He appeared to accept those views at the time, but the following day I received from him a letter intimating that he would reserve his acceptance of' the consider ation of Nos.3 7 - 20 as subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, pend ing the receipt of further instructions fi*om his Government (enclosure 1). 1 then asked M. Laronce. whether it would be possi- ble him to furnish me with t,he date of t,he issue of t,he first, titre de navigation to each and every dhow named in the list. He replied that it was impossible, as no record was kept of any but the first titre given to each owner.. I went on to inform him of the interview which I had had with the owner No.4 on his list; and after some conversation he consented to wmassit»o receive 'Ghe man's st»at.emen'5 as regards the dhow owned by him self, but, said 'Dhati enquiry would have 'Do be made from each of t.he other owners concerning their actual possessions^ I suggested that we should go together and make such enquiry forth with,, but he pointed out that as most of the owners were now absent from Sur, it could not be made before their return at the end of April,. I observed that Salem ben Selim was not likely to have spoken anything but the truth, and suggested that M. Laronce had not been supplied with correct information ftom which to compile his list* He replied that he could not be responsi ble for any mistakes which might have have been made by the Arabs, and concluded by repeating that the individuals,, and not the dhows, were the important point in the opinion of his -Government. On the 17th Instant I received a private letter from M. Laronce (enclosure 2) to which I replied officially (enclosure £.) giving the information submitted mith my letter No.101 in column 6 of the French list. 4.- I am now waiting to see whether any, and if any what, steps are taken by my colleague to shew his displeasure at His Highness the Sultan's action in regard to Salem ben Selim, or at the action of Salem himself in affording me information. It may be suggested that it would have been better had I sent Salem to M. Laronce, but had I done that a good opportunity would have been lost of emphasizing the new situation created by the provisions of paragraph 6: of the Ha'gue award. The patience and good temper with which I am endeavouring to conduct these negociations are by no means exhausted, but I submit that certain facts have to be made clear to the French sooner or later, one of which is that, as things are now, we expect from them a loyal adherence to the provisions of the paragraph above quoted. 5.- An enquiry in May, as suggested by M. Laronce, will not be worth much, as the owners will, upon their arrival at Sur, be interviewed by a French agent, and instructed as to what00273 what» evidence t.o give- I cannot, however think of anything else in t»he present circuiTist.ances which will not. be offensive 'Do the French► 6 '~ I would ask for instructions as to what reply should be given to Monsieur Laronce regarding owners Nos.-8 and 1«..' in his list» We might allow them to be considered as French / / . proteges m Oman in consideration of our views being accepted concerning Nos. 17 — 20, that is,, should it be found on enquiry that they were undoubtedly born in the Comoro Islands. 7 -~ A co Py of this letter will be forwarded to the /Government of India in the Foreign Department, I have the honour to be.

In accordance with your request I have the honour to repeat the information which I gave you verbally yesterday con cerning my interview with Salem ben Selim oued Sehele. 2.- As you are aware,. I had been told by His Highness the Sultan and others that there were some mistakes in the list which you sent to me on the 4th Instant as regards the number of dhows shewn as belonging to each owner.. On the morning of the 10th Instant I received information that Salem ben Selim had arrived in Muscat from the pilgrimage, and I took the oppor tunity of examining him in order to discover the truth or other wise of the statements that had reached me regarding the list. With such object in view I requested His Highness the Sultan to send the man to me which he did at 5 p.m. on the 10th. 5 *~ A statement of the information given to me by Salem is enclosed.. ^ou will see that he owns to the possession of one boat only, and that according to him nearly every owner actually possesses fewer dhows than the number shewn against his name. In these circumstances I beg to ask what steps you propose to take to rectify the list, as I can scarcely ask my Government to accept it in its present condition.

India Office, * * 14 February 1906, Sir, In continuaticm of my letters of the 19th and 2Eth ultimo relative to the steps to be taken to give effect to the Huscat Arbitration Award, I sm directed by Hr.Secretary Morley to transmit, for Sir S. Grey's information, a copy of further papers received from the Government of India on the subject, also of telegrams from the Ticeroy, in which it is proposed to instruct H.M.Consul at Muscat to advise the Sultan not to recognise, as subjects of the Sultan of Zanzibar, certain men included in a list, furnished by the French Consul, of persons stated to be entitled to recogni tion as French proteges under an Agreement between the British and French Governments of the 13th May 1904. Mr.Morley is inclined to think that this procedure would not be in accordance with the arrangements proposed by lord lansdowne in his communication to M. Cambon of the 24th October last, and accepted by the French Government on the 8th of the following month. It was taJaos then decided that the British and French Consuls should concert together 'as to the drawing up of a list of the subjects of the 'Sultan who are still entitled to fly the French flag' and t that ' the resu;Lt of this conference should be referred by 'the two Consuls to their respective Governments for approval.' In these circumstances any advice of the proposed kind to the Sultan would appear to be premature,as the intention evidently was that His Highness should be advised to act in accordance with a final agreement between the parties to the Arbitration. 'The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. With0027.9 With regard to the merits of the question.Mr.Morley understands that the Agreement of May 1904 referred solely to the question of '1'exercise par la France du droit de 'protection a Zanzibar' fM.Camhon to lord Lansdowne. dated 13|te,y 1904). Per this purpose a list of persons who were neither natives of a French protectorate, nor 'actually in the service of the French', but who by some other means had acquired French protection, was presented by the French Consul at Zanzibar to His Majesty's Representative. This list contained the names of six individuals, whose history/ so far as it has been ascertained, is given in a memorandum enclosed with Major Grey's letter Ho.568 of the 16th December last. It would appear that four of these men are subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and that their right to be recognised in Oman as French proteges should be decided in accordance with the terms of the Hague Award. The remain ing two, though of omani origin appear to be now subjects of Zanzibar, and in their case it does not seem to be necessary to raise any question. Mr.Morley would propose, subject to Sir E.Srey's con currence. to inform the Sovernment of India that the British Consul should endeavour to come to an agreement on this basis with his French colleague; and that the Sultan should not be invited to take any action in the matter until H.M.

I had occasion last week to visit Sur in connec tion with a quarrel which had. taken place between some British subjects there, and took the opportunity to enquire as far as possible into the number of dhows actually possessed by the owners najned in the French list.. Saiyid Mahomed bin Hamed the Governor of Mattrah accompanied me under instructions from His iiighness the Sultan.. Owners Nos.l,. 2, 4i,. 5,, 9 and 10 were interviewed collectively, (the remainder not being present at Sur)..
