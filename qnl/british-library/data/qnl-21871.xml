I enclose for consideration draft Kfegulationsi prepared / 7 by Dixon and baaed on Indian Ordinance No .III of 1942 as subsequen ly amended, which make provision for the enhanced punishment, in certain circumstances, of persons committing the offences mentione therein. In the draft Regulations enhanced punishment has not been provided in respect of offences under £ 376 I.P.C* as such provision is considered unnecessary in Bahrain; but in other respects the draft is similar in substance to the Indian Ordinance^ with the addition of deportation as a penalty. 3. Regulations 4 to 8, which are the effective ones in the draft Notification now submitted, would only come into force on the issue of an order to that effect by the Political Resident; and such order, it is contemplated, would not be issued unless the Political Resident had reason to believe, on information supplied by the Political Agent or otherwise, that circumstances had rendered its issue necessary. 4. I think the enactment of Regulations on tne lines of the draft now submitted would serve a useful purpose at the present time, and would enable us, if conditions in Bahrain became less stable, to take remedial action with a minimum of delay.

Will you kindly let me know whether the Bahrain Govern ment are willing to take similar action against their own subjects should occasion arise? You will see that the provisions relating to enhanced penalties will not come into force until there has been a declaration by the Political Resident under Regulation 3 bringing them into force. Parallel action would be -secured by the Bahrain Government, if they introduce similar legislation, issuing a declaration under Regulation 3 of their own notification at the request of the Political Agent when the Political Resident has issued a similar declaration in respect of those to whom his Regulations apply.

Els Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London* Repeated I forward herewith a draft regulation to enhance In certain clrouastances the penalties provided by law In Bahrain for the punlsiuaent of certain offences* The regulation is design ed in particular to provide drastic punishment for looting during an air-raid or other hostile action* 2. The draft follows closely the Government of India's I ' i A Ordinance Bo.Ill of 1942 as subsequently amended except that it has not been thought necessary to include any provision for the punishment of offences under section 576 of the Indian Penal Code, and that deportation has been added as a penalty* 5* it has also not been considered necessary to provide for the eettlng up of special courts, and the only change proposed in Judicial procedure is the confirnation of death sentences by the Chief Court, l*e* the Political Resident, instead of the Governor-General in Counoil* Article 6 of the Persian uulf States (emergency) Order in Counoil, 1959, permits the overriding of the provisions of any order in Council by a defence Regulation* / ** (Signature) s. 44. MFP—1015 S&amp;P—(M-1870)—9-2-39—20,000. (Desigjiatkmif a death sentence in the kind of case covered by the draft regulation is to act as a deterrent to other would-be offenders it is essential that it should be carried out rapidly, if the proceedings have to be sent to the Governiuent oi inula it will be weeks if not months before confirmation of the sentence is received and in fact if the Gulf is being subjected to air-raids it may be impossible to send the proceedings at all* further&gt; the Government of India are likely to have their own hands full and will hardly wish to be troubled with Judicial cases from the Gulf. X should even prefer to see the lolitical Agent given power to carry out the death sentence summarily without time being given for appeal and without confirmation but this may be considered going too far at present. 4. in 1939 the India Office would not agree to the provision of the death penalty in the defence Regulations then under , A*'*-** consideration, vide india Office letter ao.P.Z. 1821/1939 dated the 24th liarch 1939 to the Government of India, but i consider it essential that this penalty should be provided for the class v of case covered by the present draft. 5. The draft regulation can only apply to British subjecls and other foreigners in Bahrain, it has been ascertained that should the circumstances for which the regulation is designed become imminent the Bahrain Government will issue an 'Alan' on the same lines but couched in much simpler language. 6. i do not consider it necessary at present to introduce similar legislation for huwait and inuscat. Neither of these places are so liable to air attack as Bahrain, anc few if any of the residents for whom we can legislate are likely to indulge in looting. 7 # i should be grateful if the Government of India would kindly communicate their views on the draft regulationby telegriyn to the Secretary of state for India and this Residency* ad* %.R*Kay* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Attested * for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Ho.C/738. office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Camp* Bahrain* Bated the 24th August, 1942.

Orders Nos. 13, 15, 16 and 17 require no comment but I shall be glad to discuss with you Article 5(b) and Schedule 3(b) Order No .14, 2. The present procedure for the issue of permits to purchase rationed piecegoods is not in my opinion satis factory. The Director of Customs does not seem to be the correct authority to administer what is in fact a charity. The issue of the permits should remain in the hands of a senior official cf the Bahrain Government but he should act on the written advice or recommendation of the munici palities or Relief Committee who would be responsible for determining whether or not applicants were entitled to the concession. 3. With regard to Schedule 3(b) you will note that no percentage profit has been noted against the last seven items. I suggest that we might discuss what is reasonable profit after consulting the State engineer and the importers. 4. I shall be grateful if you can deal with this as expeditiously as possible as it is my intention on the u issue of the Orderc to ask the Public Relations Department to broadcast them and also an explanation of the individual clauses of Order No.14.

YG.CONFIDENTIAL Political Agency, D.0.No.C/282. Bahrain, 7th February 1944. Please refer to the Bahrain Government ’Alans Nos.l, 2, 4, and 5 of 1363. 2 . There are certain points of difference between the 'Alans issued by the Bahrain Government and the Orders issued by the Political Agency. It would, in my opinion, be preferable that the two notifications should be as nearly as possible identical. The principal variations have been brought to my notice and they are as Order No.l of 1944 = 'Alan No.l of 1363. 1. There is no preamble to the 'Alan, and previous 'Alans dealing with this subject are presumably still in force as no reference to their cancel lation is made. Art.1(a) . According to the 'Alan permission to export is granted by the Bahrain Government while according to my Order permission to export is granted by the Political Agent. I suggest that there should be one authority only. 3. Schedule I . There is no Schedule I in the Bahrain Government 'Alan. Presumably there have been previous 'Alans which require cancellation. 4. Application Form. The column for the value of the goods is omitted in the 'Alan and 'Country of Origin' has been translated as 'Country from which imported'. The date space at the bottom of the form has been omitted. Order No.2 of 1944 - 'Alan No.2 of 1363. 1. Article 1 does not appear in the 'Alan at all. Article 2 has been printed above the heading of the 'Alan. 2. Article 3 of the 'Alan refers to the cancellation of previous 'Alans but Article 2 of the 'Alan refers to Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Agency Order. 3. The words 'with the assistance of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India' in Article 3 (a) of the Agency Order ha¥e been omitted in the 'Alan. C. Dalrymple Belgrave Esq., C.B.E., /4. Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.2. © 4. Schedule III(A) . Cigarettes should be excluded from the 'Alan. Order No.4 of 1944 ='Alan No.4 of 1363.

Since you have not previously been informed of the expiry of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, you will not have been aware of the necessity of taking any steps to continue in force such regulations made under the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council, 1939 as are still required. Pending further examination of the legal question involved the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council 1939 and the Regulations made under it must be regarded as no longer valid, though it is hoped that any formal action of a positive kind can for the moment be avoided. 3* I should be glad if you would consider, as soon as ConiMentiaL _ SA RRAm RECEIPT /possible q- //. y 6 ,s v possible, v/hich of the Regulations not y^t individually- repealed (or parts of them) it is still desirable to continue in force, and whether any action should be taken to give retroactive effect (if possible) to any Regulations p. dqnaldsom) &lt;&amp;&gt; It must be remembered in the first place, that the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, - under Section 4 of which ihe Persian Gulf States (. jnergency) Order in Council was made - extending the provisions of the Act to Kuwait and other Persian Gulf States, and authorising the Political Resident to make Defence Regulations thereunder, itself expired on 24-th February, 194-6, and with it disappeared the sanction ior the continuance in force of any regulations made thereunder, and, of course, for the making of any further regulations, 2. Statutory provision was, however, made by the Supplies and oervices (Transitional Powers) Act, 194-5, empowering H.M, in C. to direct that certain Defence Regulations should continue to have efiect for certain further specified purposes connected with economic recovery and reconstruction, and Section 5(4-) of that Act in effect authorised the Political Resident to exercise similar powers in so far as the Persian Gulf States were concerned, I do not know, but I presume the political Resident must have taken all due steps in this connection to continue in force such Regulations as were still required, 3. A further statutory provision was later made by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 194-6, for keeping alive for a. limited period such regulations as were considered necessary in the period of transition, but were outside the scope of the 1945 Act, Under Section 18 of this Act H.M. in C. was empowered to provide for the continuation in force of certain classes of Defence Regulations having effect in any territory specified in Section 4 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, and an Order in Council was duly made thereunder in relation to certain colonies etc. - see the Emergency Lav/s (Transitional Provisions) (Colonies etc.) Order in Council, 1946, S.R.&amp; 0. 1946 No,255• Perhaps a similar Order was made in relation to the Persian Gulf States, but I am afraid I have no knowledge of any.Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939. 2 &amp; 3 Geo. 6.

A.C. = Adviser, India Office, received with '450/46 of the 7th No e.nuer, 1946 from Carloay, w.x.u# , 0.5• ^• It must be remembered in the first place, that the emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, under Lection 4 of which the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council was made extending the provisions of the act to Kuwait and other Persian Gulf States, and authorising the Political resident to make Defence Regulations thereunder itself expired on 24th February, 1946, and with it disappeared the sanction for the continuance in force of any regulations made thereunder, and, of course, for tne aing of cjiy further regulations. Statutory provision was, however, made by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, empowering h.-l. in C. to direct that certain Defence Regulations should continue to have effect for certain further specified purposes connected with economic recovery and reconstruction, and section 5 (4) of that Act in effect authorised the Political resident to exercise similar paowers in so far as the Persian Gulf States were concei’ned. I do not know, but I presume, the Political Resident must have taken all due steps in this connection to continue in force such Regulations as were stillrequired. A further statutory provision v/as later made by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) net, 1946, for keeping alive for a limited period such regulations as were considered necessary in the period of transition, but were outside the scope of the 1945 Act. Under Section 13 of this Act II. ii. in C. was empowered to provide for the continuation in force of certain classes of Defence Regulations having effect in any territory specified in Lection 4 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, and an Order in Council was duly made thereunder in relation to certain colonies etc.- seo the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) (Colonies etc) Order in Council, 1946, S.R. &amp; 0. 1946 No.255. Perhaps a similar Order was made in relation to the Persian Gulf Ctates, but I am afraid I have no knowledge of ^ny. Having regard to the above, whatever the position may be of the Defence Regulations already made under the Persian Gulf States Order, I do not think any further regulation could properly be made thereunder in relation to Kuwait. r nless, therefore, the Political Resident can contrive to bring his contemplated regulation within his normalpowers, either by relating it to one or other of.the purposes specified under Article 83 of the Kuwait Order or perhaps by exercising the poweres of restriction conferred under Section 19 of the Sea Customs Act 1873- which I presume has been applied or at any rate could be apolied to Kuwait under article 11(3) of the Order - I think he will find difficulty in rpoviding legal cover.

When I discussed the new Draft Orders for the control of exports from Bahrain and for the control of prices with you on the 26 th November, 194-35 y° v - rnade a certain suggestion the export should be prohibited. This suggestion has been incorporated in the new Order. Regarding the Order for the control of prices, you asked the following questions: (1) What are the views of imnorters on the profits allowed to them? (2) Why is there such a large discrepancy between the profits allowed to wholesale importers and those allowed to'retailers (5%)? I have since made certain inquiries on the points raised by you and I shall deal with your questions serially: (1) Mr .Tikamdas, of D.I.&amp; Sons, said that he was satisfied with a profit of 15% on his imports of food by co-rntry craft and with one of 10$ on imports by steamer. He stated that the market did not, in fact, always allow him to make 15% on the goods which he imported; and at times when he was anxious to turn over his money quickly he was in the habit of accepting a smaller profit, ^e added, however, that the big leakages alone from shipments of ghee and edible oils amounted to 15%&gt; up to the time of arrival in Bahrain and that he considered a larger profit on such commodities to be equitable. £b , Haji Abdul Aziz Ali Bassan stated that, in view of the large risk which merchants importing by country craft took, he considered that a profit of 15% was inadequate. He went on to say that insurance companies did not quote risks for cargoes shipped in country craft. He stated that the condition of the market sometimes offered a profit of up to 40$. A / t Ahmad Fakhroo considered that 15$ was a very inadequate profit when it was necessary to lay money out for 6 months for each transaction. He stated that he was able to cover his goods with insurance from Basrah and that he added the cost of insurance to his invoice price and calculated his 15% profit on the price plus insurance.My own view is in accordance v/ith Mr.Ti kamdas 1 s, i.e s , that a profit of is adequate. Were it not so 9 Messrs. Bassam and Fakhroo would not have large shipments of foodstuffs coming forward. Naturally every merchant would like to make a profit of 100$ if he were allowed to. I agree with Mr.Tikamdas, however, that a profit of up to 25 $ should be allowed on ghee and oil to cover loss by leakage. Ghee and edible oils have, therefore, been transferred from Schedule [lL to Schedule 7T (a) in the draft. ’ ' (2) The large discrepancy between profits allowed to whole salers and those allowed to retailers is explained by the fact that retailers take fewer risks on their goods of loss or damage in transit; secondly they are able to turn over their capital more quickly than the wholesalers. i k &lt; I went on to discuss the working of the present system with Mr.Tikamdas. He told me that, with the exception of the sales of wheat, barley^and sugar, which are made on ration cards, hardly any business is done at the prices fixed by the Food Controller. Merchants receiving a large consignment of, for instance, cigarettes are in the habit of selling a small quantity at the controlled price, then of telling customers who ^re not prepared to ray a higher price that they have no stocks left. The bulk of their stocks are then disposed of confidentially to whoever is prepared to pay black market prices and to say nothing about it. It is my belief that; since the original Price Control Order was passed in September, 1939, no godown or shop has ever been searched for hoarded goods, and merchants have been able with impunity to pretend to customers requiring goods at the controlled price that they have no stocks. To prevent the concealment or hoarding of stocks I have extended in the Draft Order the principle of registration of stocks held, introduced by Mr.Wakefield in respect of piece goods, to many other commodities. Such a system is of necessity cumbersome, and it may not in practice be possible to extend it to all the commodities of which the price is at present alleged to be controlled. It may, however, be ^ A vantage to extend it to some of the commodities and to maintain the previous system for the remainder. This is for further consideration. in fa *Article 1(a) ORDER NO. 11 OF 1941 For M in the forms attached to this Order” substitute ”on the form attached to this Order which shall be submitted to the Political Agency through the Directof of Customs who will certify whether in his opinion the goods which it is desired to export are surplus to local requirements. Should goods be 'surplus to local requirements” then permission to export will not normally be withheld.” incorporated in the second draft of the Price Control Order. Article 4 has been redrafted to contain the suggestions and for simplification . to punish any merchant selling any goods at prices which, in the opinion of the Political Agent, are excessive. I am not aware how Mr.Smith decides whether or not a purdah lady is sufficiently indigent to be granted a permit to buy cloth and how he ensures that she does not appear every day. In Article 5(b), a space has been left for the insertion of whatever Body is eventually appointed to issue permits to buy cloth to indigent persons. ITS . In Article 7 I would suggest that the words ”and the Bahrain Courts” and the word 'proper” before ’court* be omitted as the action of the Bahrain Courts will be legislated for by a parallel ’Ahlan* to be issued by the Bahrain Government. £ ^ t The percentage of profit to be allowed to importers of tyres, tubes, and car batteries, remains to be inserted in Schedule III(B). £o .

Exception (a) to be as at present recorded and Exception (b) to read as follows 'On articles listed in Schedule 3(b) the price should be fixed by a Committee consisting of the Executive officers of the Municipalities of Manama and Mahrraq under the chairmanship of the Price Controller.

Clause (h) - Exclude all after 'Controller' and substitute 'except in the circumstance adumbrated in the next succeeding Clause (i)'. Clause (g) - Substitute 'reasonable' for 'normal'. Clause (i) - Substitute 'authorise the prosecution of' for 'may prosecute'. Article 6. SEARCH . For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 the Agency and the Bahrain Courts may, either from their own knowledge or on being satisfied by responsible persons that there is reason to believe that any person who is subject to their jurisdiction is hoarding goods, issue warrants to the police for the search any building, container, lighter, rowing boat, sailing craft, or power propelled vessel, within the limits of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, wherein there is reason to believe that such stocks are likely to be found, the /policepolice may take-possession of any such stock pending a decision of the proper court. Article 8, Delete 'Such shall be made'. Tyres, Tubes and Batteries should be Inserted in Schedule 3(a) 5 but as the sale of these goods will be by Wholesale impor - ers to the, general public this should be noted in the Schedule and a percentage profit should be fixed.

It is not/proper ^ork for the Price Control ler or the Director of Customs and should be more properly carried out by a Relief Committee or the Municipal Bodies.

Z- The amendment will have the effect of upsetting the ordinary channels of trade and may even promote a trade in the black market instead of curbing it so long as actual rationing is not initiated. ✓ 1*3 The present system of issuing chits by the customs is not at all satisfactory apart from being illegal as suggested by the D* of C* As it is not practically possible for each individual in the Islands to take a chit from the Customs by going there and will have no chance of choosin; what he or she wants the large consignments of piecegcods that have come will be as good as not having come so far as the public are concerned. if at least.a coupon system like the ration cards for cereals and sugar are introduced the people will have better chances of getting things. The experience of people who have tried to get chits from the Customs is pitiable as they have no regular form and no arrangements for controlling ’ the people who come in for goods. Invari ably a lot of veiled women and Hamals and others scramble for chits at the customs window from morning till evening making it quite impossible for others to get a chit for a few yards of cloth. iojT t Unless the customs can make proper arrangements to issue fairly reasonable quantities of cloth for personal use without involving personal hardships for individuals who may not be able to waste a day in trying to get a chit the system will be a failure at least so far as the consumer is concerned. j_ s n0 £ unusua l for certain type of’ men and women to trade in these chits by going every day to the Customs and managing to get chits a® there are no means of identifying the people either by the customs or by the retailer. f °7 » The situation in the market having eased it is rather too late to think of instituting such a scheme and the Customs apparently have not the necessary staff to do all the trading in piecegoods themselves. 5-1-45. lot - -&gt; -H'S .✓ ft India office fisconcs MCROFU.M</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000079_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/727</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000079</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/727</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 28/34-II War emergency legislation’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-26T21:07:16</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (212 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
