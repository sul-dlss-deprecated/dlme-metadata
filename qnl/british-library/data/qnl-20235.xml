WITH reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the refusal of the authorities at Bussorah to permit the registration of laud and house property in the names of Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, 1 have the honour to report as follows :— A telegram has been received from Constantinople by the vilayet to the effect that the services of Sheikh Khazal and Sheikh Mubarek are highly esteemed by the Government, and that the Sultan is pleased with them. _ The acting vali, Ali Reza Pasha, on receipt of this telegram, sent Ahmed Nairn Bey to Failieh to inform the sheikhs, but as they were absent he has decided to communicate the message to them by letter. As regards the question of Sheikh Khazal, it will be remembered that in the time of Suleiman Nazif Bey the Tapoo office were instructed by Constantinople not to register any property in Sheikh Khazal's name. More recent instructions have been received by this department, allowing the sheikh to acquire property in houses and shops, and I hear that Sheikh Khazal has now begun to purchase houses. I am informed that after Hassan Reza Bey, former vali, left Bussorah, Sheikh Mubarek wrote to the vilayet asking why his land purchases were not allowed to be registered in his name. He stated that he had rendered good service to the Ottoman Government in the time of Midhat Pasha, former Vali of Bagdad, by going to Hassa and driving bin Saoud out of that district, and that he had always paid his taxes and given pecuniary assistance to the Government. He urged that the authorities should not suppose that he bought the land for other people, as they could do so themselves, and it was unreasonable to imagine that they wanted his assistance. He asked for a clear statement of the objections to his purchases. I am informed that Sheikh Khazal also wrote to the vilayet in similar terms, stating that he preserved good relations with the local authorities, and often captured runaway criminals and returned them to Bussorah. He asked for the reasons of their refusal to the registration of his land. Both sheikhs requested that instructions might be issued permitting the registration of property in their respective names. The Administrative Council discussed the matter and decided to support the requests of both sheikhs, informing the Minister of the Interior that there was no objection to register the lands acquired by Sheikhs Khazal and Mubarek in their respective names, and pointing out that Sheikh Mubarek had given £ T. 500 towards the relief of the sufferers in the fire at Constantinople, and £ T. 3,000 to the war fund during the Turco-Italian War ; and that Sheikh Khazal had given £ T. 400 to the Turco-Italian War fund, and £T. 300 during the present war.

I fancy that as, at t^e time of issue, the document was very secret it was not placed on the file (even though this was a confidential one), but kept in some special place, where nrobably it still is. I shall continue to have search made for it and hope to unearth it eventually. Lieut-Col.
