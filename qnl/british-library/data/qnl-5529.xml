The proposed re-organisation of the Office of the Political Agent, Bahrein, which involved an additional expenditure of Rs.7,300 per annum, has been approved, subject to the acceptance of half the cost by H.M.G. in the event of the proposal for sharing the whole cost of the Bahrein Office being accepted. We have since received a telegram from the Government of India and a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Agent pressing most urgently for orders on this matter. Colonel Loch says that he can no longer accept responsibility for any failure in his Office and that he apprehends that a serious breakdown may occur at any time owing to the pressure of work and the shortage of staff. It has been ascertained from the Foreign Office that it is unlikely that a moiety of the additional expenditure will be accepted by H.M.G. until a decision is taken on the general proposal, and that this decision may take some time. In the circumstances it is proposed that the Secretary of State’s sanction should be accorded to the immediate introduction of the proposed re-organisation. It seems unlikely that if H.M.G. decide to share the cost of the Office they will refuse to accept a moiety of this additional expenditure, of which they have been rYhaUl? made aware. The Foreign Office wi-AJL be informed that the re-organisation has been sanctioned as a matter of urgency, and that the proposal for sharing the cost of the Bahrein Office should be regarded as including this additional expenditure.

The question that we ask in our letter of 24th November is merely whether His Majesty 1 © Government, in the event of their accepting &amp; moiety of the expenditureat Bahrein, wouH approve of the proposals for the reorganisation of the Office* An affirmative answer to this question would not, of course, affect in any way the decision of Hia Kiajesty’s Govermaent in regard to the major question.

P.Z.7220/36 Department. The Political Agent, Bahrein, intimated to the Government of India in Septeraher 1935 that the staff of his Office would require to he increased in view of the additional work falling upon it. He submitted his detailed proposals to the Political Resident in October 1935* estimating the additional cost to be Rs.9l80 per annum. The Political Resident forwarded the proposals, with the exception of that relating to the pay of the head clerk (which reduced the estimated cost PeAj, ifijSb to Rs.8268)^ to the Government of India/, with a strong recommendation that they should be granted at a very early date. The Government of Indian recommendations reduce^ these are now submitted for sanction. The final proposals are that two additional clerks should be appointed at salaries of Rs.155-285 per mensem, j plus Rs.30 rent allowance, plus Rs. 15 special pay; and one additional clerk at Rs.125-225* plus Rs.30 rent allowance; while one post carrying a salary of Rs.l80 per mensem and a temporary post with a salary of approximately Rs.125 per mensem should be abolished. The scales of pay recommended for the new posts (Rs.155-285 per mensem and Rs.125-225 per mensem) correspond to the scales of the existing similar posts with the Gulf Allowance consolidated: The special pay of Rs.15 per mensem is for confidential work. These proposals are strictly economical. It is to be hoped that the scales of pay are sufficient to attract ! the type of man who will be competent to deal with the Iwork. The original request of the Political Agent that the salary of the head clerk of the Agency Office soon s/ae should be increased by Rs.75 per mensem, has been eliminated/ the additional cost further to Rs.7,300^ per annum, andeliminated altogether, although the staff of the Office is being increased. There is ample evidence to show that the work of the Agency has increased considerably in the last few yea 1 rs, and there is no reason to suppose that it will be reduced in the future. It is understood that no assistance is to be expected from the Political Residents staff when they are transferred (in two or three years* time) to the Island. « * The proposal that the cost of Bahrein and Muscat shall in future be shared by Imperial and Indian revenues, is under the consideration of H.M. G. It is probable that it will be accepted, in which case Treasury sanction to this additional expenditure would be required. In view of the urgency of the need for additional staff, it is proposed to ask H.M.G. to accept a moiety of the cost, pending a decision on the general question. A draft to the Foreign Office is submitted accordingly. \ ' b&gt;ia 3- ON' Dmj &gt; im^uj 4r / I Ul ^ ^ ^ k %, f.o.m fa (Vki) /] / / &gt;\s'cA / ^j ^ i^hTAo YaaJA u ffautc * fch+b d*M*&lt;~*- &gt; (Am CAK y&gt; fficAAj . y ^ Z 7 * 1 ' 7'°^* r ,, ti / , ^ Ccjp^ 'to \ / CL|(V&gt; ot. wCc Draft Paper. p. z. 7220/36.

In effect, therefore, so far as the number is concerned the increase in the staff proposed is one and for the reasons advanced by the Political Resident, the G-overament of India agree to the proposal except that one of the new posts should be in the Lower Division* The Bahrain office (English Section) will therefore consist of 1 Head Clerk l 7 OCT 1338 * * * r)p. or: 3 Upper Division clerks2 Lower Division clerks / &lt;— .— v_y i*e. six in all of which two wi;ll be ^nployecl in the • ^ , * J Confidential Branch. 3. '.s re^irds the scales of pay and allowances, the Grovermnent of India consider that the pay of the posts should be on an ad hoc scale, taking into account all the conditions and circumstances under which duty is performed and that in addition to the pay so fixed no Culf allowance (called Special Pay) should be attached* Further in consideration of the confidential and important nature of the work that the two Upper Division clerks in the confidential Br inch will be called upon to perform, it is considered that a special pay of Rs. 15/- each per mensem should be attached to theseUpper Division posts. It has therefore been decided that the new posts to be created should be on the following scales of pay and allowances Pay Rs. 155-6-185-10-285 2 Upper Division clerks (one to be designated - Stenographer) 1 Lower Division clerk 4. House rent allowance.Rs.30/- Special pay for confidential work Rs.15/- Pay Rs.125-4-145-5-225 House rent allowance Rs. 30/- per mensem. The additional posts are required^largely in the interests of His Ilajest27' , s O-overnment/the extra cost involved is estimated to be about Rs.7,300/- per annum. The expenditure at Bahrain is at present borne entirely by Indian revenues but the question of sharing this expenditure has already been referred to His IIajesty f s Government vide Foreign and Political Department letter No. F.546 H/33 of 16th January 1936. As the extra expenditure now proposed will also form part of the divisible expenditure, the prior approval of His Majesty's Government is required to the proposed revision of establishment. In view of the urgentnecessity for the additional staff it will not be desirable to postpone their entertainment and the G-overnment of India would be glad if pending a decision on the general question the consent of His Majesty's Government to bear a moiety of the expenditure involved by the revision be obtained and communicated at an early date* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Under Secretary to the Government of India* V( 2 r' Godv of a letter No*455 dated the 25th February 1936, from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Forei^a Secretary to t AA e Government of India, New Delhi. Reorganisation of the Bahrain Agency Office I have the honour to refer to Colonel Loch 1 a letter No.2000, dated the 29th September 1935, recommending the creation of a temporary appointment of an Upper Division clerk in the Bahrain Agency Office and foreshadowing the need for strengthening tne clerical staff of that dgency. 2. I now submit extracts from Col. Loch f s report containing his proposals for reorganisting the English section of the Bahrain Igency Office. The facts and figures given in support of the proposed increase of establishment speak for themselves. I entirely agree with the view expressed in paragraph 6 of Col.Loch T s letter cited above that, in view of the recent developments in Bahrain itself and the Trucial Coast area generally, it is no longer possible to regard the Bahrain Agency Office as a political office of the old days in the Persian Gulf, and that it needs to be reorganised to meet the new ana ever increasing demands upon it. 3. It will be observed that Col Loch proposes to divide the English Office into two sections, viz., the general English section and the Confidential section, the former to be composed of a Gazetted Officer in place of the present Head Clerk, two Upper Division clerks and one Lower Division clerk; and the latter to consist of two Upper Division clerks. The proposal thus involves the creation of one gazetted appointment •of-of Registrar and Treasury Officer, and three additional appointnents of clerks in the Upper Division (incxudx'ig the temporary appointment sanctioned in the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, telegram No.1089-E, dated the 23rd October 1935). Against this increase, the appointments of Head Clerk and Passport Clerk are proposed to be abolished* 4. I strongly support the recommendation for the creation of three additional appointments of clerks m the Upper Division against the abolition of the post of Passport Clerk, but in order to reduce the cost of the proposed scheme, I consider thb.t there should be no change for the present in the status and emoluments of the post of Head Clerk. I accordingly attach a revised nro'oosition statement, marked W B', excluding the proposed gazetted post of Registrar and Treasury Officei* The average extra cost of the proposed scheme, as modified above, will amount to Rs.8,268/- per annum. 5* I would like to add th^t, since Col. Loch framed his nronosals, the Bahrain Petroleum Company are proceeding apace with their refiners project, thus immediately increasing the work of the Agency in every branch* 6* I,therefore, recormiend that the Government of India will be pleased to accord very early sanction to the above proposal, and trust that it will be possiole to arrange for the necessary provision to be included in the ensuinm ye r f Q budget*Extracts from letter No. B-2 dated the 20th October 1935 from the Political Agent, Bahrain. Reorganization of Bahrain Agency Office. T have the honour to refer to paragraph 6 of my letter No.2000 dated the 29th September 1935 to the Government of India, in which I foreshadowed that a reorganization of the Bahrain 'gency Office would be necessary. 2. The whole nature and volume of the work in Bahrain has undergone a marked change in the last- few vears. In 1925 the administration of Bahrain was * placed on a regular basis. A British Adviser to the Bahrain Government and a British Director of Customs were appointed. An armed Police Force was raised. The administration has changed in less than a decade from a purely tribal autocracy which was beyond measure corrupt and inefficient, to a system which combines a large mea-sure of efficiency in essentials with the retention so far as possible of the best features of the old tribal rule. This change lias led to a great incurease in the work of the Agency Office. The institution of the Air Route along the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, the establishment of tne Naval Base in Bahrain, the development of the oil field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the opening up of Qatar by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and exoloration for oil and other minerals on the Trucial a. Coast have also entailed a great and growing volume of extra work, especially as owing to the loss of the R.I.M.S. Lawrence and the unaccomodating attitude of the Iranian Government the Trucial Coast has nad + o be placed under the supervision of the Political Agent, Bahrain. The establishment of the Bahrain Petroleum -Company-Company ha,s brought many Europeans and Americans to the island with an attendant demand for all kinds of assistance from the Agency, and their standard of office work makes a greater demand from the Agency Office inevitable e Relief has been afforded to the Political Agent himself by the appointAof an Assistant Political Agent, but this in turn has led to greater demands upon the Agency Office*, 3* I enclose figures which show the xhekbe increase in correspondence and in Treasury work, but these figures do not by themselves give a true picture of the increase in work, for a great deal is done in a place like Bahrain by word of mouth, and I should emphasise that in an Arab country business cannot be hurried♦ **-***■* 5. T propose that a regular Confidential Office shall be established in the Bahrain Agency. In view of the secrecy which attaches to much of the correspondence of the Bahrain Agency and. of the interest which is taken in it by persons and institutions both on the island end elsewhere, special precautions are essential* At present the work is carried on by one clerk in a little room, once a dressing-room, off the Political Agent's private office, which is most inconvenient*, It is, moreover, only possible to cope with the work as the clerk concerned has been doing it since the time when it began so rapidly to increase. He can no longer do it himself and in any case must go on leave shortly, after which he will, I think, be promoted* I propose that the Confidential Office should continue to work directly under the Political Agent and consist of a Confidential Clerk and a Confidential Stenographer, both of whom should be clerks in the Upper Division. The Confidential -Clerk-Clerk must be a man of sufficient standing and length of service to be entrusted with cyphers• It is impossible for the Political Agent to spare time for cyphering and the Assistant Political Agent will seldom, now that Qatar is being opened up, be available. I propose that the Confidential Clerk should receive a special pay of Rs.35/~ a month in addition to the special pay of Rso35/*- attaching to the Upper Division posts in the Persian Gulf in view of the responsible and confidential nature of his work. Both he and the Confidential Stenographer are likely to have to work longer hours than is usual in an ordinary office,, The Confidential Stenographer must also be an Upper Division clerk because of the secrecy and responsibility of his work and because it is desirable to have a man of some standing as he will accompany the Political Agent on his tours. I propose that the Confidential Stenographer shall also receive an additional special pay of Rs. 35/- a month in view of the confidential nature of his work and the special qualification of stenography which is desired of him because a great deal of the Political Agent’s work involves interviews which must be committed to pa.per as soon as they are over in order that a clear record may be kept of the business which is being transacted. 6. I propose that the English Office shall in future consist of a Registrar and Treasury Officer, two clerks in the Upper Division (one of whom must be a skilled accountant) and one Lower Division Clfcrk, who must be a really competent typist. Owing to the increased complexity and responsibi lity of the work and the fact that the head of the Agency office has to transact business and live in social contack with a number of well paid clerks of important commercial institutions (the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, the Eastern Bank Limited, -Cable-Cable and tireless Limited, and so on) I consid.er 'bha'fc his status should be raised to a gazetted rank and tn*t the emoluments of the appointment should be improved. I propose that a gazetted post of registrar and Treasury Officer should be created on the following terms:- Pay Rs.300-10-350 Special Pay Rs.75 House Rent allowance Rs.50 Although the office is not large enough to be divided into definite branches, I propose that the w ork shall be separated into three main ca,tegoriesj- (1) Bahrain affairs (ii) fet Sa’udi, Qatar and Trucial Coast affairs (iii) Accounts, budgets, stores. The actual work will have to be divided between the clerks somewhat elastically, but roughly the division of labour will make one Upper Division clerk responsible for accounts and stores and the other, with the help of the Lower Division clerk, for records and submitting ordinary work* 7. If the above strength is sanctioned, T em prepared to dispense with the post of Passport Clerk which was sanctioned in 1925 and of which the pay is mor e than covered by passport and visa fees, which average Rs. 6000 a year* 10* I enclose a proposition statement showing the effect of this reorganization which involves an additional expenditure of Rs*9,180/- per annum.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000dc_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3658</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000dc</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3658</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/82 'Bahrain Agency office: reorganisation'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-25T10:50:39</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (36 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 38; these numbers are written in pencil and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the reorganization of the Political Agency Office in Bahrain.The file covers the employment of clerks.The file is composed of correspondence between the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Conditions of employment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000dc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
