I hope from Gracious God, that you are enjoying the best health, and should you condescend to enquire after me, God, be praised, I am quite well.

With best Salaams to the Honourable fhaikhs - Hamad,Muham mad, and 'Abdullah and every one dear to your Excellency. My■ The Residencv, / / J . . - \\\H Vd »• , k M M Wi Bushire, yth June T n 17 , i have duly received (yesterday) your d /0 dated 4th May 1917 forwarding corses of correspondence in 1906 regarding the Bu Samait trihe. In reply to your D/o letter of the 14th April I can now inform you that our views are the same as were expressed by Sir P.Cox ,in his D/0 of 29th April 1906. The Bu Samait have m been settled in Persia for generations and are to all intents and purposes Persian subjects although of Arab extraction. All matters affecting tlfeir landed property in Persia hp.ve to be dealt with by Persian Law. This would be the same even if they were British subjects or proteges. Since 1906 the .situation has been slightly altered by the fact that we have a Vice-Consul permanently at Lingah. in specific cases of injustice the Bu Samait might represent the facts to the Vice-Consul who might be able to do something for the sufferers in a friendly way, though he could not of course make official representations on their behalf.

The first request was made in 1901, and discussed between the Political Resident Colonel Charles Kemball, and the Political Assistant at Bahrain, John Calcott Gaskin. In 1906 a further request was made, and again discussed between the Resident and Bahrain Political Agent (now Major Percy Cox and Major Francis Prideaux respectively). A third request was made by Shaikh Muḥammad bin Ahmad Āl Bu Sumait via Shaikh ‘Īsá in 1917, when Major Arthor Trevor was Resident and Captain Percy Loch was the Political Agent.The Āl Bu Sumait tribe wanted to move away from Bandar-e Lengeh because of the discrimination they faced at the hands of the Persian authorities there. Bassidore was most desirous to them because they wished to become British subjects, and hence be protected from Persian persecution. Representation was made via Shaikh ‘Īsá of Bahrain because the Āl Bu Sumait tribe were historic allies of the Āl Khalīfah. However, successive Political Residents rejected the their requests to move to Bassidore. In his letter to Loch of 8 June 1917, Trevor stated that “the Bu Sumait have been settled in Persia for generations and are to all intents and purposes Persian subjects although of Arab extraction.” (folio 20). A potted history of the migrations and movements of the Āl Bu Sumait tribe was written by Gaskin in 1901 (folios 3-5).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
