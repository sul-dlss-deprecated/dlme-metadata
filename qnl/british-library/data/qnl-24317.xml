Ij. heading the minutes of the previous meeting whicn is to be signed by the President arid tue members who may be present. 2;, Luring one of the previous meetings of Puharraq Balaueyah Majlis, it was decided that new Ford and similar taxi motor cars should carry five passengers excluding the driver. During the meeting held on 25th Safar 1354, it was decided that Ford and similar motor cars should carry four passengers excluding the driver in accordance wits, what was previously decided by the Manamah Baladeyah bu as the Mawnah Balcdeyah have recently decided that lord anu similar motor cars should carry five passengers excluding the driver, I think we should amenu our resolution and fall into line with them, making tne number of passengers of taxi cars equal in Muharraq anu liana man. 3) . As a sanitary precaution, the Muharraq Balaaeyan nave, since a long time, appointed an official specially for seeing to the animals before they are slaughtered and disallowing the slaughter of sick ana very weak animals. For this job, tne official in ^uestiuii receives a pay of ns.ou/- p.m. from the Baladeyah. But it is regretted that the Munarraq Baiadeyah recover no fee on the animals wnereas she should have recovered such a fee in return for that task as is done by the Baiaucyans in the world ana also the kanaman Baladeyah who recover as.o ; - for each sheep in her name ana As.4/- in the name of the Government. The expenses of the nurse is met out of the latter fee. Therefore, it is quite reasonable for tne Muharraq Balaaeyah to recover a fee on the animals slaughtered. 4) .

Reading the minutes of the previous meeting. 2) . It has been noticed that the quantity of fish brought to the Moharraq market during this summer is very small. I think this is due to the fact that the Muharraq Baladeyah have prevented the fish-sellers from selling their fish by wholesale to the retailers because the sale of fish in retail will cause delay to them, and especially when the quantity of fish is big and there is no market for it, it gets rotten owing to the excesive heat. The Baladeyah Inspector then throws the rotten fish into the sea. In consequence, the fish-seller incurs two losses; firstly waste of time and secondly loss of fish. For these reasons, the fish-seller prefers to take his fish to Manamah where he can sell it by wholesale, receive the price and go to his house or his fish-trap, as the sale of fish by wholesale is not prohibited there. Undoubtedly this will adversely affect the people of Muharraq as the price of fish goes up and the demand increases. 3) . Some arrangement should be made by•which the Balaaeyah can recover their various dues from the house owners if they are less than Rs.5/-. 4) . The question of compensating Ahmad bin Jubarah for cutting off his house for the purpose of widening the road at ^ Hidd is to be considered. The question of making a settlement ^ with the sons of Ahmad regarding the amount which the Baladeyati want to cut from their house, is to be considered as they want# the Baladeyah to give them money ana they will undertake to rebuild their house. Their upper room, two rooms arid one shop will have to be cut off. 5) . Discussions and suggestions in connection with the Electric Department. 6) . Miscellaneous. 7) .
