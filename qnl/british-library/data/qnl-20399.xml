ADdul Aziz TDin ATDdur Rahman Al Faisal. To - Hon # T3l« Colonel Cyril Barrett, Political Besident, Persian G-uir* After Oompliments. 1 desire to inform Your Honour of the following in order that you should 'bring same to the notice of the British aovernment. 7e have, 'by God&gt; graces and His Providence finished the punishment of rebels in all the Nejd territories and there remain none ^except a few routed pai tits who are on the 'boundaries of Kuwait. And on this date there have gathered at the Hofar al AtiJ under urieir respective 'banners / those forces which we ordered to gather in order to proceed against those rousted parties. And on this sa*e date we proceed In person / from RLadh / to command those forces and to lead them against those routed parties. 2. And the news has reached us at this time/when the rebels heard about our making for them,they got advice CaP-U'Cil rf tnw Utv ^ ^ 4. 4 fromy/heighbcuring countries to the effect that if ou^ forces ^^w^them and they feel unable to withstand same (the forces) they should do nothing but to run away in parties and join the Arabs of Kuwait and Iraq, and thereby to ensure safety for their properties and lives and also that the rebels may save themselves and in order that their advisers should likewise have time enough to renew difficulties between us and the British Grovernment. The situation as it can be seen by the British Government will be difficult for us nereafter and in ' off view of the fact that we have now started^there would r«main no ti*« exo.pt only f.w iays between this date the day wiien we shall have reached the plaoe where the rebels remain; and you know that fet land wa*- oonditlonsprevail it is not an easy thing to harmonize acts with the time and that the first opportunity is usually the one availed of for defeating the eneiay. ^e therefor# propose the enforoement of the following:- a. W® propose that the Government of Kuwait should order their subjects to gather all in one certain place and to station some forces in front of them to protect them - all in a place away from places where it is feared they will 'be the fieli. of aotion y and then the Kuwait Government snould inform us of this place then trits Government should also station real forces ( and we do not 'believe that aeroplanes alone will suffice) to 'be about Kuwait and its limits to prevent any forces of the rebels from talcing refuge within its 'boundaries should ol(nc£ct&gt; they want to do so # and there ie/be with these two forces officials on behalf of the British Government; and/it AC kcfi* should 'be possible for this force to expel^with all means it can, to the most distant point even to within the limits of Ne jd f in oriLer to ensure their non-entry into the(Kuwait) boundaries; and should it so happen that anyone of them whether an importantyor of little value / fly from any road into the Kuwait or Iraq, territories, should be arrested and handed over to us« In this case there will remain no cause for our forces to enter Kuwait borders. b. If these are not all possible to be carried out^ we propose that Kuwait subjects should be ordered to ih 0-c remain in one certain guarteiy^known to us / and then we should be left alone to deal with the rebelsato purste (*0 them/anywhere and we undertake in this case to protect the other subjects of the neighbouring countries and to prevent any encroachments upon them and we also undertake that none of our soldiers should remain in the neighbouring lands after the first hour in which the pursuit of culprits is completed. In this way^3 A {au l)y G-od's power an@L strengtii / ami reTDals* fate will 'be sealed ooiapletely* 4. This is what we see good for adjustment of the rebels difficult question and putting an end to tneir s't^uQe• And it is impossible xor us to rotrun froiii our ^ter the trou'ble^ywe^have experienced, the great expenses we have incurred and all the great exertions we sustained 'before we have sealed / 'by Clod's powe^ the fate of the last routed party of the re'bels. If the .British Government do not agree to any of the two proposals we shall iDe'/sorry for the situation which will result from it. And we desire you to emphasise to the British Government that it is not easy for us to see this section of our subjects tasting hitter punishment at our hands and verily it is heart rending to us to see them with their families and children in the « present condition in which they are today; and that made us to punish them except the fact that they obtained our protection and then transgressed upon Iraq and Kuwait subjects, we therefore see nothing would repair the violation of our 7/arrant which is the true Arab warrant but to mete our most exemplary punishment i up6n them so that they should realise the result of their treachery and the violation of their promise. If thos^^overnments Mrt^Cx to assist us in this matter which we have taken up for their own and their subjects safety, we do not desire that in cosequence we should come in a collision with the forces of the -British Government by ourown forces which is distinguished /tza oiitij by their beingy'by us personally; this is what we fear of and it is not possible God willing that we should • A attempt it. And in that circumstance we shall have nothing to do but to abandon the completion of the act of punishment and to adopt a policy by which we can completely safeguard our internal security and we shall then not be responsible, in any waftfwhatsoever, for anytransgression wiiich. might T dc d.one upon the neighbouring countries; we shall then 'be exouseO. 'before ourselves in particular and 'before all in general 'because we shall have fought our own people for the sake of our neighbours, hut our neighbours thenselves , 'harhourefl. their own enemies and assisted, them against us- are now proceeding on our way and should, we receive news of the enforoement of one of the two proposals - too. the neighbouring countries.well and good and if not we shall 'be sony to have to resort to the last policy and will 'be the last opportunity for taking any precaution 'by us for preventing all transgressions upon the neighbouring countries and the responsibility therefoi will devolve upon neighbours and not upon us« This is what we request you to convey to the British Government as soon as.possible and we have already written, to this effect, to H.B.M's Agent at Jeddaii, in order that he should inform the British Government about same.

His Majesty's Government have learnt of contents of Your Majesty's letter of November 17th to the British Agent at Jeddah with regret. they have repeatedly given to Your Hajesty to use all means in their power to prevent improper use of Kuwait and 'Iraq, territory 'by Your Majesty's rehellious subjects. Efforts which latter have made to take re fuge in Kuwait territory have indeed already 'been frustrated more than once and on Sept euro er 3rd Your efficiency with which the British authorities in Kuwait had carried out their undertakings 'by formally thanking them for their efforts. Crovemment were approached as recently as Novemher ist hy Sheikh Faisal-ed-Dawish with requests for guarantees for his women and children. They are credibly informed that overtures for peace which Faisal Dawish is reporte recently to have addressed Your Majesty were princi pally due to the uncompromising attitude which His Majesty's Government have taken up in reply to these requests. His Majesty's G-overnment have moreover given material pro^f of their earnest desire to co They 'have never failed in undertakings which r Majesty's Government recognised the sincerity and the As Your Majesty is aware tteet His Majesty'sco-operate with Your Majesty in suppression of reloexlion in North east Nejd 'by assisting Your Kajesty to obtain from India arms which you urgently required and hy arranging to supply in neat future on specially favourable terms four aeroplanes of latest type with necessary 2XXX British personnel. Further supplies for use with these aeroplanes are already on the way out to the Persian Gulf and should reach Darin early t in Decemher. His Majesty's Government feel certain thatJthese expla/nations will dispel any misunderstand ing as to their attitude. Careful enquiries have convinced liis Majesty's Government that Your Majesty must have 'been misinformed as to assistance which the rebels have obtained from Kuwait and 'Iraq.. His Majesty's Government desire in this connection to place Your Majesty on your guard against accepting reports from untrust^fi and unreliable sources. Turning now to specific requests contained in Your Majesty's comrnuniOation^His Majesty's Government^in addition to strict instructions already given to their authorities in Kuwait and 'Iraq., of the nature of which Your Majesty has been inxoiLied^have taken following action. In their desire to meet Your Majesty's wishes as far as possible and to show their readiness to co-operate whole heartedly with Your Majesty in re establishing peace and order in your dominions (i) they have now issued renewed instruc-* tions which should ensure that pledges already given to Your Majesty shall be fully implemented. (ii, j Instructions have been given to secure the removal of all Kuwait tribes and of refugee Awaaim from the vicinity of the frontier or from any scene /posalhle conflict, (ill) Instructions have 'been given con cerning necessary military measure-s for ejection of any of contending forces that may enter Kuwait oror * iraq, territory and to intercept wherever possible isdated groups of rebels entering such territory for purpose of merging with the local tri bes in the manner^which Your Maj esty suggests. With regaTd to coTimnjnication addressed 'by Your Majesty's Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British Agent Jeddah suggesting that rebels may attempt to escape into TransJordanian territory in structions on similar lines have now 'been sent to the High Commissioner for Transjordania which should effectively guard against the danger. Your Majesty will seefrom the foregoing that His Majesty's Government have gone to the furthest possible limit in their endeavour to co operate Your Majesty on the lines suggested hy your They regret ^'however that they cannot in any cir cumstances modify their decision againso allowing Your Majesty's armed forces to enter Kuwait, 'Iraq, ssl or TransJordanian territory. Apart from the risk, of which Your Majesty has already 'been informed hy the British Agentj Jeddah that such forces mr.ght be mistaken foi rebels, instructions issued to British local author! ties for ejection of any of the contending forces that may -cross the frontier would inevitably^ result in your forces coming into conflict with those of His Britannic Majesty, a contingency which His Maj esty's Govern rent and Your Majesty would equally deplore. In conclusion His Majesty's Government ^ ^ would again point out that the task of their Military Authorities would be rendered less difficult if Your Majesty could designate an emissary from Your Military forces to keep the local frontier authorities at Kuwait informed of the movements of Your Majesty's troops and of the rebels. *******61/14.

Visit of the rebel leader ohaikh Naif al Hathlain, Sir, I have the honour to report that on 19th No vember 1929 and unbeknown to me, Shaikh Naif al Eathlain paramount chief of the Ajman turned up secretly with one man on the outskirts of Jahrah, and sent in and asked if he could see His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. The latter without referring to me in anyway, sent and told him to quit Kuwait territory without delay, as the British G-overnment had forbidden all intercauMe between rebel leaders and himself, and that if the Political Agent heard about his arrival he would have him arrested at once# Shaikh Naif hastily departed. I am sorry to say that His Excellency only told me the story on Saturday the 23rd j and then only when I taxed him with having heard about the rebsl leader's entry from another source. 2. It is possible that His Excellency honestly thought I would have the reiiel Shaikh seized^as H.M 1 s Grovemment had in their recent reply to al-Duwish f s three questions, threatened that this would be done in the case of further visits of rebel leaders, so he quietly had him ejected, intending perhaps afterwards to inform me. As he said nothing I had to point out to His Excel lency that he had not played 'straight' by me. 3. I further pointed out to him that it was by my own efforts also, and not through him that I found out J fthat some of the rebel camels were ocraing down to drink in the evening at Jahrah # And that only when I complain ed to him officially he proceeded to write and report the fact to me as well as the Subalhiyeh and Tawil in cidents, mentioned in my telegrams Nos» 638 and 640 of 22nd and 23rd November respectively# 4. As already mentioned in the first of these telegrams I fancy His Excellency lost his head somewhat after the recent arrival of Bin Saud's emisary Shaikh Hafidh Wahba, He did not know what the latter was going to report to me or what information I was going to to him impart/about rebels and Kuwait* He fancied that to keep silence was the best policy© I have now throughly rubbed in the fact to His Excellency that he has no better friend than myself here, and that he need fear the intrigues of no person, enemy or supposed friend, in his Town provided he confides in me always and above all trusts me # I t&amp;lnk he has taken the lesson to heart« 6 # In fairness to the Shaikh, I must add that he is surrounded by a great many rogues and traitors, who while flattering him always, are in many oases in cons tant communication with Bin Saud* ^e knows this though does not feel strong enough to take energetic action# As regaxds the AJman leader, Shaikh Ahmad is connected by blood ties to both the Hathlain house as well as to that of Duwish^and this fact alone tends to make him favour and wish for the success of the rebels# It is after all only natural and I cannot blame him# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col#, Political Agent, Kuwait#GOCTIDmTIAL .

Sir, In continuation of my telegram No# 643 dated S5th November 1929, I have the honour to report that as I was anxious to make ciuite certain that none of the Akhwan whose camels were watering at Jahrah — vide my telegram No# 640 dated 23rd November 1929 - were camped inside the Kuwait frontier, between the Shaqq depression and the al- Batln, I decided to make a careful examination, on the 24th of November^ of the area lying in the South West corner of Kuwait State# I incidentally decided also to kill two birds with one stone, and visit the ooncentration of Kuwait tribes camped to the North West of Jahrah# 2# The results of the reconnaisance which lasted 13 hours were satisfactory^and I ami able to report that no Akhwan tents exist anywhere between that portion of the Shaqq. lying inside the State and the al-Batin# It was further pretty evident that the camels which were reported as watering at Jahrah came from across the border, from camps situate in the re-entrant West of Manaqish hill# This was confirmed by Bedouin reports uhlch placed seme of the t9 Bralh n 9 (Mutair) just across the border line in this locality# The route taken by me was as follows: Kuwait- Jahrah-Khabrat. al-FaraqjUm Amarat al-Shaqqy Um- Aaarat Matzul-Abrag al-HabarWJm Ruaiaa^Qraa al-Murru- Thamllal al-Qao^ and back by Jahrah# 5# When one recollects that to the Bedouin the artificial boundary fixed by us and only visible on maps-2- means nothing, a^d the fact that al-Duwish has been able to keep his widely scattered Bedouin from actually camp ing across this line, shows the man possesses great in telligence and no mean control over his people. 4 # It may be asked why the Akhwan sent some of theii camels to water as fax North as Jahrah, not to mention Tawil and Subaihiyeh, and in spite of all our warnings* The answer is simple. There is no other water available^ owing to the failure of the Autumn rains^for either camels or human beings camped in the North West corner of the Kuwait neutral area,and about Hamatiyat tiBExXxxxtX situate across the Shaqg between Khabra al-Duwish and Abu al-Hiran hill, 5. For the infoimation of those who do not know the Kuwait and adjacent areas it may not be amiss to mention that during sammer. or in th^ Anttima ±f the rains have failed , the only wells with unlimited water for camels to drink at are:- (a) Jahrah. ) Tawil, | in side Kuwait. Subaihiyeho) (b) Grain. ) Wafrao ) in Kuwait Neutral Zone. Shathaf. ) Maragha. ) (c) Arak. } Hamudh. j Ingair. ) South of the Neutral Zone. Naalriyeh. ) Nta. ) (d) Jariya Sifli ) Jariya Ilya ) along the old Kuwait boundary Safa, ) lineo Hafar al Batin.) a € Rlc^ai in the Bat in at the South West corner of Kuwait territory provides a little water, but only enough for man and a few sheep. 6. As soon however as rain fans, water collects everywhere in various ''pans 1 ' and lies for weeks at a time, in particular is this true of the whole length of the Shaqq and the Batin. Then and only then are wells deserted altogether for a time. 7. Again as grazing in the vicinity of wells general- ly is very soarse In the Autumn, It having been all eeten-3- eaten up by oamels caniped on the wells themselves during i the long suramer season, the Bedouin, as we see today, are forced to remove as far as possible frcm all wells to keep their oamels and sheep alive* They accordingly water the±r camels once in 7 days, sheep once in four days and horses once in three days . This from force of circumstances not from choice^ of course. 80 Hence today one can be sure of finding all Bedouin encampments not near water at all but 30 to 40 miles away from it, struggling to find grazing and at the same time, not going too far from water* 9® Only oamels and sheep travel to water, human beings and horses have water brought out to them on the backs of camels which have drunk* 10® Taking therefore present conditions and dis cussing only Kuwait and the Kuwait Neutral Area, we find, (a) Dhafir and Shammar 30 miles distant from and drinking at Safwan wellso (b) Kuwait tribes 30 miles from ffahrah y /ells. (c) The Braih (Mutair Akhwan) 40 miles from Jahrah wells, (d) Jlblan - Dooshan (Mutair Akhwan) West of Shaqq. ^ 40 miles from Subaihiyeh and Tawill wellso (e) Ajman (Akhwan) South end of Shaqq 40 miles from Grain, Wafra and Shathaf wells* 11* Hence denying water to the Akhwan camped around Hamatiyat and depending on Jahrah, Tawil and Subaihiyeh must compel a Southward move of al-Duwish and his people, 12* Therefore the move of the Akhwan to the Southern line of Haffar Safa, Jariya al Ilya and Jariyah Sifli now in progress txm is directly due to us* I have the honour to be.

RESIDENT. Telegram Code Krom Politioal Resident, Patrick Stewart To Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi No.T/ll Dated the 4th December 1929, His Majesty's Government have learnt of contents of note with regret. They have never failed to implement undertakings given to prevent improper use of Kowait and Iraq, territory 'by rebels and on 3rd September recognised efficiency of efforts of British authoiities in Kuwait by formally thanking .hem. On 1st November Dawish asked them for guarantees for his women and children. His Majesty's G-overnment are credibly informed that recent overtures for peace are due to uncompromising attitude which they have taken up. His Majesty's Government have given proof of their desire to co operate by supplying arms from India and aeroplanes. They are convinced Ibn Saud has been misinformed as regards assistance given to rebelsfrom Iraq, and Kuwait and warn him against accepting reports from untrustworthy sources. In their desire to show readiness to co operate (1) they have issued renewed instructions to ensure pledges shall he fully implemented. (2) Instructions have heen f^iven to remove all Kuwait tribes and refugee Awazim from vicinity of frontier or seene of possible conflict. (3) Instructions have been issued concerning necessary military measures for ejection of contending forces that may enter Kuwait,Iraq, or Transjordania. His Majesty's Government have gone to furthest possible limit to co operate and can in no circumstances allow Bin Saud's armed forces to enter Kuwait, 'Iraq or TransJordania. Apart from risk that forces might he mistaken for rebels instructions issued for ejection of any contending forces that may cross frontier would inevitably result in conflict between troops of Bin Saud and His Britannic Majesty^. Finally they ask Bin Saud to send emissary to Kuwait for liaison. - RESIDENT -Telegram R To Fr on XjpddLfeij^i Secretary of State for the Colonies, Londcru British A^ent, Jeddah, Ro. 139.

(2) You shoixld add that according to the statements of the leading Awazim Shaikhs (see Bushire telegram to Colonial Office No. 54, repeated to you under No. 1069 ) if refuge in Kuwait was not granted their only alternative was to throw In their lot with the rebels and fight against Ibn Saud, a course which they wished to avoid. In these circumstances it appeared to be entirely in the interests of Ibn Saud that the Awazim should be Neutralised by admission into Kuwait territojr^, (3) The expulsion of the Awazim in accordance with Ibn Saud f s request could only be effected by the use of force and it is out of the question to contemplate such a breach of the obligations which the Shaiklji)f Kuwait assumed when he gave the Awazim permission to escape the rebels by taking refuge in his territory.

As already stated by me, the statement made by the x^ing in the body of his letter about^rebels being inside ioiwait territory is entirely incorrect. 2 # I might mention that His Excellency the Shaikh also received a letter from Riath dated the same date as mine in whi ch H»M # the King after many compliments, stated that as he was about to drive the rebels against ioiwait boundary, he trusted that His Excellency would co-operate with his forces assisted by those of H.M's Grovernment, and attack the rebels in rear when they arrived. Many other letters in similar strain have also been received by mambers of the Shaikh^ family and the notables of Kuwait, ^ mention the above as H#M, the King appears to have one type of letter for H.M t s Government t s officials and another for His Sxcellency the Shaikh and his people. The real meaning behind such tactics would appear to be the King's desire to whip H.M»s Govenment into activity, and if possible by direct and indirect means 'panic' us into taking an active part in his war, and attack the rebels on his behalf. I feel certain the King does not feel strong enough to n take on 1 * Buwish single handed, but by an intensive propaganda of 'falsehoods' such as (a) the rebels having hidden themselves inside % p-2 inside Kuwait territory or (b) tternriBBta his being about to xaalce an innaediate attack on them, and Ms requiring iimedaite oo-operation from us, or (c) that the rebels, are camped right inside our territory etc., he hopes to sting us into committing ourselves, and bombing the rebels* He knows that such action would bring the rebels to their knees at once» I might add that in my considered opinion Bin Saud has not yet left Riath (i»e« on 4th December 1939) and this is the opinion held by His Szcellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and other ^sound' persons* I have the honour to be.

It had beew vacated about three days previously and Ibn Hithlain had moved South. Ajman shepherds with flocks of sheep, who necessarily move slowly, were encountered also moving or preparing to move South. As heavy rain is threatening and there is a risk that armoured cars, if remaining at Jahrah, might became bogged, I authorised them to return to Basrah on 7th morning but arranged for second reconnaissance to frontier by tour- «ing car and am awaiting further report.

I am disturbed to learn from your telegram under reference that the Awaaim are at present in the neutral z»ne and that no attempt to move them into Kuwait is apparently contemplated. I consider their presence in the neutral ?.one to be inconsistent with the assurances given to Ibn Saud and initself most undesirable. In Bin Saud's eyes it would seem confirmation of his belief that the rebels intend to use the Awazlm as agency for obtaining supplies from Kuwait ( see Jeddah telegram No. 170) and, if defeated, to escape by mingl- ^ing with Arabs in neighbouring territories. Moreover Bin Saud would be provided with an incentive for entefr* „ir.g Kwisdbbdatxxxtexy the neutral zone with his forces if the Awazim remained In their present position. Unless impracticable you should at once arrange with the Shaikh of Kuwait for the removal of the Awazim from the neutral zone and for their con** ~ccntration in Kuwait in some region distant from the frontier or the possible scene of conflict. Should the Awazim decline to leave the neutral zone I suggest that t ;ithat they should be informed that inview of the under- •takings given to Hon Saud His Maie8ty , s Government and the Shaikh ofKuwait are left no option but to treat them as part of the contending forces with the result- that they would be liable to attack should they sub- •sequently attempt to enter Kuwait territory, andin the meantiiQe ie denied all supplies from Kuwait.

We understand that the Kuwait 1 rentier zone which is being cleared extendp for e. depth of Pbout 15 mileB along the who 1 e length of the direction of the Kuwait - Ne^d frontier to the neutral zone. Please con- -firm this and report by telegraph when the evacuation has been completed. As regards the remainder of the frontier zone H.M f s. Government realise the impracticibility of the complete evacuation of any area on which the economic life of Kuwait depends, but you will have seen from Foreign Office telegram to Jeddah, Mo. 134 of 30th Novem- -ber, that Ibn Saud has been informed definitely and cat- -egorically that instructions have been given for the remov- -al of all Kuwaiti tribes from +he vicinity of the front- «ier. The fact that the frontier area East of the North-Western corner of the neutral zone ( approximately half that total frontier and including the important wells of Subei^iya ) has not been cleared is inconsistent with the formal assurance which has been given and to which it is essential for the sake of our good name to adhere if possible. Otherwise the effect may be embarraising on our relations with Ibn Saud. Ifit is quite impossible to implement the assurance a further explanation will have to be s^nt to Ibn Saud without delay in the hope that it will forestall possible accusation of bad faith on the part of His Majesty 's frovernment, which it would in the circum- -st^nref be hard to counter# PleaseA.'V 3 Please therefore te3-ecraph immediately full particulars of the position in the uncleared area and especially whether isolated shepherds and woodcutters oriy or the entire population have been allowed to remain in It. If the latter, every effort should be made partially to implement the assurance given to Ibn Saud by the removal of all elements not essential to the economic life of Kuwait to a distance of at least t±&amp; 10 miles from the frontier. As regards the Awazim no further communication will be addressed to Ibn Saud until the reply of the Awazim to the ultimatum reported in your telegram of 8th December is known; but the sj+^tlonis delicate and any development should Ifce immediately reported by tele- -gram. It is important moreover that there should be no misunderstanding as to the question of the allegiance of the Awazim. H.M's. Government have hitherto only approved of the grant to them by the Shaikh of temporary shelter ( see my telegram of 1st November repeated to Baghdad as No. 340 ). If the Shaikh shows any disposit- -ion to regard the present admission of the Awazim as constituting permanent transfer to him of their allegiance , ( see your telegram No. 54 of 31st October ), further con- -sideration will be neceesary since the Foreign Office doubt the legitimacy and expediency of such transfer of allegiance in the present circumstances. Please ascertain-and report what is the sit-iation. In the meantime you should make sure that nothing is done to prejudice the position. The foregoing refers to ycur telegram T—B of 3rd December and my telegram of 7th December repeated to Baghdad as No, 391. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES. A* p-s^/£ i 9 ^ jh'ic tu / a s $61^14.

The letter to the Shaikh was a curt demand to know the nature of the message, also a request to be made aware of any communication whatsoever that might take place between the Shaikh and subjects of Nejd. Tbe letteT to me enquired if I knew of the nature of the message and pointed out that it is highly undesirable for the Shaikh to interfers in the affairs of Hejd subjects. On the rime day the Shaikh c?illed on re and made an official protest against the obviously consular activities of Hafiz Wahba; he suggested deporting him under the terms of the Treaty. I however advised him first to take the advice of His pasty's Government. I think Hafi* Wahba's action calls for a protest and I should be grateful for ite orders on the subject.

Also woodcutters go out to collect brush wood for sale in the town. It is only these Individuals who are permitted in this zone, and the Political Agett reports that with the removal of the tribal elements the whole area IB practically deserted except for them. To deny them the use of the wells at Subaihiyah and Tawil would force them back on Kuwait and gravely affect its economic life.

In the first instance Bin 3aud sallied forth with only a few followers to try his fortunes against iiin Kashid, but could make no progress, so 3haikh imbarak sent out the Mutair and Ajiaan to assist him. A battle took place at Banif and resulted in the defeat of Bin Baud and the Kuwait forces, who suffered some 700 casualties and 4 members of the Shaikh^ family lost their lives. Subsequently however dissensions appoa.x* to have arisen among Bin lashid*s tiibes and taking advantage of these Bin Liaud was enabled to lako possession ot Kejd, hut his position was weak and he appealed to Mubarak for assistance against his rival Bin Kashid. The Mutair however refused to march and Mubarak attacked them in person with the ^jman, in- -flicted a salutary lesson upon them and ordered them hack to Jahra. Having regained control ; ubarak ordered both the Ajman and the Mutair to march to i&gt;in ^aud's aid and a battle occurred at Jarab between Bin Saud's forces ana those of Bin Kashid. At this battle the Ajman and Bin Baud's 'Hathari' forces were on the left and the Mutair on the right. tiin auci's left wing was broken owing, according to Bin Baud, to treach- -ery on the part of the Ajman, hut the situation was saved to some extent hy the Mutair on thB light. n the whole however the honours were with Bin lias hid and Bin Baud was compelled to retire to Nejd.

The Ajman In coiapany with some oi' Bin baud's other tritoes than went off to Central Hasa ana Bin aaud again appealed to Euharak for assistance. As usual Mubarak responded, and sent the ','utair under Uisj ow.n sons to attack them, sending word at the same time to Bin Saud to Join forces with them. The latter however, while the Kuwait forces wore waiting for him, marched to the South of the Ajman and offered them jjeaoe under the must binding oath, the oath of God. hey accept- ad, hut directly they had done so Bin ,'5aud attacked them in the nights he was however utterly defeateus -is brother was killed, he himself was hit in the log, and compelled to flee to Hoffuf. It was some days before the Kuwait forces heard what had happened; when they did so they retired to Kuwait, where a family council was held. teubarak was so disgusteu at Bin Uaua's act of perfidy that he was for leaving him to his iate. jabir and salim however ware for continuing to help him and finally a small force of 400 horsemen under Jahir and Ahmad, the present Shaikh, were despatched to Uofvuf. There they found Bin 3aud besieged in two small forts, the town itself being in the hands of the A. J man. The small Kuwait force could not /ohvi-jusly overcome the Ajman hut for 70 days they carried on a guerilla war- -fare against them, being joined, hut only just towards the end, by the Beni Hajir, one of Bin Baud's tribes, while Bin Oaud himself lay inactive and made no sorties. The Kuwait forces however inflicted numerous oasu^ties on the Ajman, and the latter, wearied of the game, finally withdrew to Kitha near Juhail. jin Jaud and the Kuwait forces followed them pp and were preparing to attack when orders were received from ubarak to cease operations as the Ajman had tendered their sutaissionsuMission to him; peace was conclucieci ana ubarak ordered tiie AJman back to iiat ^/arif while fiin .;&gt;c.iuu i eturn* -ed to Kejd, Jaoir and Ahmad to Kuwait. hile en route for Kuwait news was received of Mubarak's death, and Jabir reigned in his stead# 6. It was now that Bin Baud began to preach the extreme tenets of Wahabism, and the Aichwan movement really started, and Bawish announced his intention of joining it and went off with the nutair# J a. bix how** -ever only reigned for one year ana died of plague: no particular incident occurred 'between Kuwait and Mejd during this period, 7 # Jabir was succeeded by oalim: that much ot the present friction between Kuwait and Jlejd dates from this period cannot he denied. jJalim was stupid and obstinate and would listen to no advice. tie Ajman and the Awazim soon after followed the Mutair. The defection of his tribes was a sore point with .ialim and he showed little tact In his dealings with the grow- -in^ power of Nejd while Bin 3aud claimed to rule up to the walls of Kuwait. Two battles occurred; one at Kamuth in Hasa,where Salim was defeated- 'by i)awish him- -self, and another at Jahra, where Salim boat off Dawish's attack. Finally it was arranged that ihaikh Ahmad should proceed on a mission to Hejd with a view to effecting a settlement of outstanding matters# While en route news was received of salim*s death. Ghaikh Ahmad was welcomed with open arms hy Bin Baud, who congratulated him on his accession, and it was finally agreed that there should he perpetual peace between Kuwait and Hejd, no boundaries, and complete freedom of intercourse, and the news was proclaimed hy heat of drum in the cities of Kuwait and I^ejd. 8.11. 8. For soma roonths all went well, trade flouiibh- -ed and the tri'bes were at peace. in ^aud proueadea to attack Hail and Shaikh ihmad rendered him every assistance possible, sending Mm IS. 1,60,000/- m cash and 3000 camel loads of supplies, and finally sin Jaud was victorious and Ms power firmly establishea. 9. soon after this Bin Baud wrote to .ihaikh Ahmad and said that he was in need of funds and raised the question of custom duties, and demanded that a lixaa sum should he paid to Mm annually hy Kuwait. as in Arab eyes this would have been regarded as a tribute i ;aaikh Ahmad refused to pay a fixed sum, hut recalled the assistance he bad rendered Bin Baud in the past, and renewed his assurances that if Bin 3aud was au anji time in difficulties he would again assist Mm by any means in his power. Bin Saud then aemanded that he should have his own officials in the Kuwait customs house,, but for similar reasons Shaikh Ahmad refused to agree, ana there is no douht that had toex be agreed he would Uave lost his position as an independent ruler in the eyes of his own people# 10. It was then, 7 years ago, that Bin Baud declared a blockade against Kuwait, and for 7 years this small State has been subject to constant raias, its trade has been in great measure destroyed, and its economic life seriously interfered with. Its customs revenue, which was formerly about 8 lakhs a year, has fallen to about li lakhs. Trade is stagnant, and were it not for the pearl industry Kuwait town would have been reduced to a village and most of the populat- -ion compelled to seek their living elsewhere. The list of these raids was forwarded with Oolonel Barrett's ctesps.'tGti 40&gt; dated 8th. August 1^2--•5/* ^ 11 • During this period came the jair oonlereDce and the grievances of Kuwait at the results are known. Kuwait territories were reduced in extent and tbe chief grazing grounds of the Mutair and AJman transferred to Bin jaud, thus finally severing their connection *ita Kuwait and leaving this small principality defenceless, shaikh Ahmad recalled to me how on oir i ercy Oox t. return he said to him 'Then it is still the sword that wins the day in Axa'bia rt * 12. Finally a year ago came the revolt oi the Mutair and Ajman against Sin Saud. v.Viile the storm was brewing the Shaikh received a letter from Bin baud askins for Ws assistance and cooperation, but not un- -naturally this was not forthcoming. It may not be without interest to recall briefly the origin oi the present revolt, as recounted by 'aisal al .fev.isu to Colonel Dickson some time ago. He stated that when Bin 3aud started his religious crusade they were in- -flamed with the idea that the days of the prophet had returned: that Bin Saud was a new Imam and under his leadership Islam was to bo purified, and extended and a 'jehad* was preached not merely against imiuolvj but against mm such dissenters as Sunnis and Jhiahs, who were to be destroyed or forced to conform to Sahabi tenets. When the expansion of Bin baud's power was checked he was compelled to check his Akhwan ana to renounce his 'Jehad' and the 'Imam' legend was broken. The ifutair and Ajman leaders demanded that the matter should be referred to the Ulema, and a conference was called. Dawish and Ibn Hithlain at first refused to go to Bin Baud's tents although he offered them safety on oath but they said they would meet him at t^he Ulema's tent: Dawish however subsequently agreed to meet Bin Saud but on arrival he was shot through the stomach andand tils tocLy given to his woiaon to rgidovc■. j bn :. itul&lt;-in made good his escape, and as is known, Bawish sutisequent- -ly reoovered. 14, To return to Kuwait, directly the revolt occurred the ralas ceased, trade increased, shepherds and others were enabled to wander iar aliela uniaolebted, and ships began to bring much larger consignaients than formerly for Kuwait. Xhiuc four months, after seven years, Kuwait enjoyed prosperity. -hen came the flat of His Majesty's Government that all supplies were to i)e denied to the fikhwan, and the Shaikh, «ho hiid heen blockaded by Nejd for 7 years was ordered in his turn to close his frontiers and to abandon the old Kuwait tribes who were ready to return to tueii ioiiiier allegiance. 15, I think it can be said that Jhaikh Ahmad has genuinely tried With all the means at his disposal to carry out the ajQtsxxxii wishes of Hla Majesty's .fovarn- -ment. He realises that he is between two poweriul neighbours, that deprived of the only two Kuwait tribes that count he is defenceless and that his only hope oi maintaining his Independence is to rely on the British Government. That the Akhwan have on occasion camped in Kuwait territory and used Kuwait wells is undeniable, but that the Shaikh has copperated Ipyally with the iolltlcal Agent In having them turned out as rapidly as possible with the means at his disposal is equally un- -deniable. It must be borne in mind that the Kuwait hounaary Is indistinguishable on the ground to tribes- -men, and is a purely artificial one defined by no landmarks; It is doubtful If many Europeans would confidently say exactly where it runs. .'he ohaikh has no forces at his disposal who are capable of turn- -ing out the Kutalr or the Ajman: the only method he can employ::9 eMX)loy is persuasion. On the other luma the fact that the Kuwait customs statisuics show no im.provement is proof that he has denied them supplies. 16. His 'excellency stated, that he had recapitulat- -ed these past events to show the relationship subsist- -Ing between hiia and Bin Baud and the dirfioulty ot effecting a settlement• 'o the support ot kubarak and Kuwait forces did Bin iaud largely owe his original successes; at Hoffuf his life had been saveu by Jabii and Ahmad with Kuwait forces. hen shaikh hmad visited him he had promised perpetual peace with Kuwait, and at Hail the shaikh of Kuwait had afforded him every assistance in his power. Despite all this in baud would not abandon his arahition to rule up to the walls of Kuwait. It was only against Kuwait that it was proposed to impose these customs posts: there %as no talk of customs posts on the *Iraq. frontiers though in normal times many caravans left %obeir for Hejd, neither had Bin Uaud claimed customs duty on goods imported through the Trucial Ooast ports or Oman. He, Shaikh Ahmail, was ready to agree to any reasonable arrangement compatible with the maintenance of his own position as and independent ruler, hut he was convinced that Bin •;aud would agree to nothing unless His Majesty's Govern- -ment informed him in the plainest ^erms that they would not tolerate aggression into Kuwait territory. 17. His Excellency stated that for 7 years he had reported every instance of aggression to the i olitical Agent, but as far as he was aware no representations had heen made on his hehalf, and in no instance had any compensation or redress been obtained. ~e added that as long as the rebels were in the field he had no tear of8 t\ ■ \ j y\ i of Bin 3aud; he did not seem to think it prohahle that Bin 3and ivould beat tiiim in the open field, but he did think that within a short period terms of peace would probably bo arranged# Danish himseir has stated that he was sure that he would then be oraered to raid into I uwait territory but that to this he will never agree. And Shaikh Ahmad is convinced that as soon as Bin Jaud has come to terms with the utair and r^Jman he will renew the blockade of Kuwait and the raids into Kuwait territory. He was most grateful tor the assurances that he had received that in the event of his coop erat- -ing loyally vyith the British authorities His Majesty's Government would endeavour to effect an honourable settlement with Bin Saud; he thought however that past history showed that there was little prospect ol -&gt;in &gt;aud agreeing to any reasonable arrangement, and that on one pretext or another he would reject all proposals put before him, except under the strongest pressure. He hoped however that, if his forebodings came true. His Majesty*8 Government would, in view of his deience- -less condition, take such measures as might be possible to protect not merely the town but also the territories of his principality and the property of his subjects, and also to obtain redress for the past. IS. I would emphasise that Shaikh A.hmad spoke in no carping or complaining spirit; he is certainly an attractive personality, an Arab of the desert rather than of the aulf type, and as he himself stated several times has spent most of his life among the Bedouin. He realises fully that since the aafection of the 'utair and AJman he owes his existence as an independent ruler entirely to the British Government. I promised him however that I would report what he had told me and I havehave therefore repeated the conversation at length since it would seeia desirable that when endeavours are made to effect a settlement Pis Majesty's Government should ,'be in possession of his past relations with Bin jaud so that they may appreciate the difficulties that will have to 'be overcome. It would not seem to be a question of arriving at working arrangements regarding customs duties or similar matters, ithese present little difficulty given some measure of goodwill on both sides) hut, au fond, one of curbing the ambitions of a power- -ful ruler.

The Ohalkh can hardly help contxasting the ;;reat zeal displayed toy His lajesty's Govemment in coia- -pelling him to close his frontiers to the Akhwan with the entire lack of zeal displayed hy them when in .'aud was harrying Kuwait. It is the old story of the big man and the little man. 2. As regards Bahrain, as you are doubtless aware, Bahrain is the one place in the whole Oulf where land is ' valuable. It is purely a commercial centre; it ^osaass- -es numerous exceedingly wealthy merchants: wg have improved the administration out of recognition and with the construction of roads and other Improvements and underp \ v? under a more or leas British wlralnlstration oanliaenca is returnings outsiaers are flocking to Bahrain: trade is flourishins and the merchants arc building Tine houses on the outskirts of the town.

By this method and this method only,said the ahaikh,would ii.H. King Bin saud hold his hand. Should H.U's Ooverrment not aot in this manner he the Shaikh of Kuwait prophesied a repetition of tha incidents of the last few years against • Iraq, only this time it would be his territory that would suffer* 3 . The Shaikh spoke with great emotion as he told me all this, and appeated deeply dejected at the eituation generally He again and again empliasized that Le tiad nls best to treat the rebels strictly according to the orders given him by E.M 's Government, and that in spite of the fact that both the Uutair end ..man were once « tribes, aad were related by the closest blood ties to house, he had steadfastly refused to give them supplies and assistance, or afford them the obvious facilities of his port, to so doing /he had incurred the odium of his cm subjects to a degree he had never experienced before. xhe Shaikh went on to say that apart from E.k. TTing Bin Saud's many acts of perfidy and Ingratitude towards Shaikh Mubarak in the later years of that Ruler-s life and taking oniy the period of his own reisa, H.k. King Bin Saud for the last 7 years had imposed his cruel strangle -hold on Kuwait and had shown his -anforgiving enmity by every form of hostile act short of open war. ms 7 years blockage alon, had reduced Kuwait's customs revenue from 7 lacs to li and had all but ruined his peopla* All this H.M.Kln S Bin Saud had doae and more, through a personal dislike of his house and to satisfy^IS swora amtitloa, oft E tat 9 d. of nevex resting till Ixe ^ad planted his standard over the Kuwait oustoms building and made his, the uhaihh of Kuwait's suall kingdox., on appaaag® of Hei4# 5 # His opportunity, ccaatlnued ubrnfcl ^» vjQ throw off H.M .King Bin baud's tliroat-grip, and free KPmXt,and his people, had six months ago presented itself when S -aisal al Djwish left Artav-iyeli for Hassa to lead the present rebellion. -1 Duwish then invited him offi cially by letter and influential missioa, to throw in his lot with the rebels, and lead them himself, (reported at the time by me), but he had preferred to obey H.k's CJoTernment's oaamands and trust her oounsels rather than follow those of his own advisers, or the diotates of his own conscience. This refusal to take the advice of his own people to study his own interests and not those of H.K's (Joveiment, was now about to lead hln greater trouble and perhaps disaster, unless H.M's Govern- uxeiit came to liis assistaiio9» 6 He solemnly warned H.M*s Qoremment that no state bordering on K.Jd would know peace till H.M.Bin Saud the 'bully' and 'tyrant' of Arabia was overthrown, he now aaked H .M' s Government to carry out h.r treaty engagements with him. and see that Kuwait csme to no harm, and by this He said he did not merely mean the protection of Kuwait town, but the whole area of his State. In fairness, he said, this was due to him since it was H.M's Sovemment alone who had tied his hands, and forced him to adopt a neutral attitude in the present struggle between al-Duwisl. and H.M.Bin Saud* 7 . The Shaikh asked H.M's aoremment to picture what would hare happened had he placed all the resources of Kuwait at the rebels' disposal from the start. He ventured to think that by now B.M .King Bin Saud would have been without a kingdaa and a refugee, for it was the righting material of Hajd that had revolted and nothing—4— oouia Ixfeve prevented suooess If supplies and munition Had flo«n in regularly. ^ ** reverse Had Happened, and tHat H .M.Bin aaud Had been able to bring about tHe Atalba tribes' oollapsa, and was on tHe HlgH road to bring about tHe early submission of tHe Hassa Insurgents under al-Du- wisH / vas entirely due to tHe action of H.M's Governm^t.

I quite understand how the mistake arose about what happened on the .5th instant. 2 I have just put up a short paper to the High Commissioner here^pointing out that we are rather using the SHeik of Kuwait to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for ua and suggest^ that the time has come whlM might make some Tt^re definite promise «ith . regard to preserving the integrity of KXIifelT. 1 think the Sheik is in a most unfortunate position and it is up to the British Government to back him up a little bit mo re than they have done in the past, but I do not know what Sir Francis will do about it. , I think everything is moving smoothly o • now, with Dickson, as regards reconnaissances of aircraft and armoured cars. In accordance with your suggestion I am making use of him for getting intelligence. I have Just got a telegram from hin asking for air reconnaissance to be continued, ^ it would help a lot if Dickson could get a IV/T set there. U.. [i I feel that the necessity for having u 11 Ihrrr iS%ch reduced unless as you say we establish some sort of temporary air or armoured car basein IT . In the past we have found it difficult to get information and some time ago Dickson was Complaining that he was not /be ina:page 2. X being given information by the Sheik oi KUWAIT. The g.3,0. has means of getting information whioh may be unavailable to a Political Agent, e .g. he gets an allotment of Secret Service Money. The idea of sending him there would not be to spy on the Sheik of RU'.felT but simply to collect general information which .my be just as necessary for the defence of KUWAIT as for any other purpose. However, as I said, I dc not see the necessity for sending one there under the present circumstances and if I do see any reason for sending one, 1 will consult you about it first. r I was very glad you told the armoured oars to go ba^k to BA3HiiH. The fact that you did so, shows that we are all working together as one show. « nickson sent an emergency telegram &lt; • on the 16th of this month asking for Immediate assistance from our armoured cars from ADHAIBA. 1 am afraid that the assistance we actually rendered was a bit indirect, we did not send the armoured cars into KUWAIT to work with the Sheik's force but we moved them down the BAT1N. Dickson met llubb and the armoured cars and the object, i.e. turning AJMAN back into KEJD, was achieved. I would have sent the armoured cars into KUWAIT if it had not been for the fact that we had several panic messages from the 'Iraq Neutral Area and as there seemed a possibility of an unfortunate incident there I had to move the whole force of armoured cars in that direction. Looking forward to meeting you on the 15th January and wishing you are the best of luck for 1930. ~ Colonel H.F, Biscoe, The Political Resident, Persian Gulf • YoursTelegram Code ^ ^ !li Political Betiident, Busiiire ^ 0 Secretary of State for Colonies, London ITo Repeated British Agent, Jeddaii, Foreign and Political Depat,, Hew Delhi, Ko.i292 Duied a4th jJecember i929.

It is comparatively easy to deal with Large tribal gatherings but to deal with small : v par t le s Air Vice-Marshal 3ir nober,t Brooke- 'opharn, K.C.B., C.M.G., T).S.0. # A.KC., Air Officer Co binding, Iraq Command, Baghdad.parties of very mobile ruicierR who ax'e gone almost before one has £;ot news thai they have entered Kuwait Vr f(jiksu* y territory is a very diffiuult proposition, and before addressing Government on the subject 1 shall be grate ful if you will let me know how best, in your opinion, the situation sdc wi th which we arc confrfr^ted can biimt be tackled. ^he only measures that i can think of are that if Bin Baud renews his raiding tactics^s seems very probable^ a section of armoured cars should be located at .Tahrah or some other convenient point and that we should arrange with the Diaikh to increase his patrols along the frontier so as to bring in word on the arrival of the raiders and then if the armoured cars or aeroplanes from Basrah can catch them before they have left Kuwait territory and give thera a real lesson it w ild have a very wholesome effect and ^ would probably deter Bin Saud from further co raids.
