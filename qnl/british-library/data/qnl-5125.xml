The whole question was recently referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence and to the Cabinet, who agreed on the || 25th May, that in view of the attitude of the Afghan Government (See Katadon No. 53 of 21st April), it was no longer either practicable or politic to attempt to oppose the establishment of the German air service to Kabul.

QUEST I OH OF THE ESTABLISHMENT 01 ^ /U T AIR SERVICE BETWEEN INDIA AND KABUL. The question of an air service from India to Kabul has in recent years always been considered with special refei ence to the danger ox the establishment of a regular Soviet service to Kabul from the U.S.S.R. The conclusion reached by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India has been that u the Soviet Government' would gain greater advantages (political and strategic) from a Soviet air service to Kabul ? than would we? from a complementary British service 3 and consequently it h not been in our interests to take the initiative in establishing a British service to Kabul, as this would have made it easier for the Soviet Government to obtain a service on their side.' On the other hand, in the event of the actual establishment of the Soviet service, it has been recognised by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India that it would be essential for.us to maintain a British service in order to miti'ate the effects of the Soviet service. A German weekly air service to Kabul is now in operation, though no definite agreement on the subject has yet been concluded between the German and the Afghan Governments; a separate application to the Afghan Government being required for permission for each flight. We are also on the point of granting the Germans facilities for an air service to the Far East by the normal route used by Imperial Airways across India and Burma. In these circumstances the question has been raised whethen it would be to our advantage to run a service from India to Kabul, if permission could be obtained from the Afghan Government,/2. Government, in order to counteract German influence in • Afghanistan. On a previous occasion in 1932 v/hen the question of a German service in Afghanistan was mooted, H.M.G. and the Government of India were prepared to regard such a service, as far as Kabul at any rate, with goodwill as tending to exclude a Russian service. Since that date, however, the position has changed considerably. Anglo-German relations have deteriorated and there has recently been a great increase in German economic penetration into Afghanistan. At the beginning of this year there were no fewer than 119 Germans (71 men) in various posts all over Afghanistan and they are at present by far the largest foreign community in the country. On the other hand, there is as yet no evidence of political intrigue by Germans in Afghanistan. Moveover there is a good deal of hostility among the Afghans themselves against the recent increase in the number of foreigners in the country. It is quite probable, therefore, that the German community has reached its peak and will henceforth tend to decline, though the economic influence which Germany has obtained may nevertheless remain and the maintenance of the German air service would tend to consolidate this influence. Prom the strategic point of view the danger of a German air service seems clearly to be much less than that of a Soviet Service. For the present the German service to Kabul may be regarded as being on an experimental basis. Ane original scheme was to extend the service from Kabul across Sinkiang to the Par East in co-operation wicn mie Japanese. This scheme has been shelved for the present, though/3. though it does not appear to have been entirely abandoned b^ the Germans. At the same time there is abundant evidence that the Japanese are still hoping to participate in this service and that they are anuious to negotiate with the Afghan Government on the subject. Before they could participate effectively it would be necessary for the Japanese P apart from the difficulty of obtaining facilities from the Afghan Government which the latter will probably not be eager to grants to secure a oase in China from which to fly across Sinkiang to Kabul. The activities of the Japanese are somewhat obscure ? but perhaps the most plausible explanation is that they hope soon to bring the war in China to a successful conclusion and dictate terms to the Chinese. They would then secure permission from the Chinese Central authorities (whoever they might be* if any* at the conclusion of the war) to fly across Sinkiang from China to Kabul. In Sinkiang itself Soviet influence is predominant* while the Provincial authorities are virtually independent of the Central Chinese Government and strongly anti-Japanese. It seems improbable therefore that the Japanese would be able to establish landing grounds in Sinkiang* even if granted permission by some Central Chinese authority to fly over that Province. Apart from all the other obstacles* the physical difficulties of the route v/ould be very great. At present* therefore* the position is that the German service has reached a dead-end at Kabul and there seems little prospect of it obtaining an outlet beyond Afghanistan in the immediate future. It cannot/4 . cannot Toe a paying proposition and it still seems lust possible that in course of time it may die a natural death. If, on the other hand, a British service were to be established between Kabul and India this would have che effect of linking up the German service to Kabul with their proposed service across India to the Par nast. ihe establishment of a British service would involve the opening up of a u corridor 4 ' through the prohibited area*' on the North-West Frontier. Under the International .air Navigation Convention we should then have to allow occasional flights by foreign civil aircraft in this ''corridor' but refusal to permit a second regular air service to use it would not be a breach of the Convention. On the other hand; with the Germans already running a service to Kabul and also a service across India it might not in practice be easy to refuse them permission to join up these services by flying the same route as ourselves from Kabul to India ; especially if as seems likely, similar reciprocal facilities had to be granted to the Afghans as a condition of their granting facilities for the British service. For strategic and political reasons there are of course strong objections to the establishment of any foreign air line in the oouth or South East of Afghanistan. The present German service to Kabul and Tehran is very fast (the scheduled time between Berlin and Tehran is only 27 - 30 hours) and a through route from Bagdad via Tehran, Kabul and Peshawar to the Far East would be slightly shorter than the route followed by Imperial Airways. Even if it were practicable to exclude the Germans from the Kabul-India route the link provided by the British service might still tend to crystallise the5 . permanent air route. There is als f.lso the old danger that the establishment ervico might make it more difficult for the 1 st a Soviet reguest for similar facilities of a British s Afghans to resist It is true that the Afghan Government have permitted the British air line to Kabul though it could not be justified may be inevitable in which case we could not afford to be by such development than we should gain by our own participations and it is doubtful if the existing German service is a sufficient argument for taking the initiative in the matter at this stage by pressing the Afghan Government to allow a British service. It might however be worth while asking the Government of India and the Minister at Kabul for their views on the subject. If for reasons of policy His Majesty's Government and the Government of India considered it desirable to establish a British air line to Kabul, the financial difficulties should not be very great. When the matter present German service in spite of Soviet opposition and that the present trend of Soviet policy seems to be against the linking of the U.S.S.B. with other countries oy cir servicesj, but Soviet policy is opportunist and circumstances might cause the Russians to revert to their previous attitude and press for a regular Soviet Air Service. on economic grounds. It is possible that ultimately the general development of foreign air services in Afghanistan left out of it. But on balance we are likely to lose more was/P.Z.9089/35 of ¥. about £11,540 was last under consideration in 1935 the hovo■ India calculated that the running of a weekly service by Indian National and Kabul via L than Ns.3 lakhs -Nrways in both directions between Delhi ahore and Peshawar would cost rather more per annum. They were prepared to charge approximately half that amount (for the Delhi-Lahore part oi the route) to their Civil aviation estimates and to debit the remainder (as bein- entirely uneconomic) to the Afghan Deserve Fund. An annua.1 drain of upwards of Rs.l^- lakhs would be certain sooner or later to unbalance the latter fund* and under our arrangement with the Treasury the Government of India would expect His Majesty s Government to meet any expenditure which could not be covered out of their own annual contributions of Ds .5 lakhs to the fund. The financial aspect of the scheme may of course have changed considerably since 19 35. In particular the Government of India did not find it necessary in 1935 to allow for any initial expenditure on aircraft since they proposed to run the Service with certain machines then available in India. It would probably be necessary in existing circumstances to incur fairly large capital expenditure on this account.Draft Paper. 1 POLITICAL Department. DRAFT LETTER. Lt. Col.

Luang Pradist presumed that the Siamese would only become a party to it on suitable terms, as in the case of other countries 0 His Excellency added that he had heard nothing of a connexion between Berlin and Tokyo; he gathered that the idea was for Lufthansa to link up at Bangkok with the service to China of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation* 3o The above iniormation has been confirmed to me by Mr Jackson, the Operations Manager of the Aerial Transport Company of Siam, who said that the representative of Luft hansa in question was the Kapitdn-Loutnant Schiller mentioned in my despatch No 39 (45/11/38) of January 26 th last and elsewhere* Mr Jackson said also that his company (ice* the Aerial Transport Company of Siam) hoped to obtain the agency of the German line if it succeeded in coming through to Bang kok - a contingency which, he supposed, depended upon the consent of the Government of India* Mr Jackson went on to explain that, according to Kap itdn-L cut riant Schiller, Luft- &lt; bans a had now abandoned the notion of a service from .purop e to China, via Kabul and Sinkiang and thence to Canton, on account of the unfavourable weather conditions prevailing along this Northern route, and that it had been decioed ou iuirr&gt;nuiiir»iMin ~iirrr y follow the Southern route from Baghdad via Karachi, Calcutta and Rangoon to Bangkok* Mr Jackson supported the statement of Luang Pradist that the intention of Lufthansa was to join- up with the service of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation* I pointed out that the establishment of such a link was not completely practicable as yet, since the CiUxasia machines at present went no further than Hanoi, the gap between Q.• 3 . place and Bangkok Being filled By Air France&lt;» Mr Jackson thought that it would he only logical if the Furasia Cor poration should now ask the Siamese to allow their machines to cone as far as Bangkok, hut Luang Pradist tells me that his Department has not yet heen approached to that end, Mr Jackson agreed with me in judging it likely that Lufthansa ha.d in mind connexion at Bangkok with a Japanese service to Tokyo in addition to that with the iiurasia service, though he said that he was without definite information on the subject. This assumption appeared to me so reasonable after what had heen published in the vernacular press that I brought the point up in my conversa tion with Luang Pradist which I have already recounted. As I have said, he informed rne that he knew nothing of such a project, hut he admitted readily that negotiations with the Japanese Government for a service to Bangkok had now passed beyond the stage of verbal discussions reported in my despatch to your predecessor No 8 (12/4/37) of January 4th, 1937* (See Foreign Office telegram to me No 1 of January 2nd, 1937)° The negotiations with Japan, Luang Pradist said, had now reached the semi-official stage and the terms of a formal convention were under consideration, Luang Pradist gathered that the Japanese service would be one from Formosa via Hong Kong and Hanoi, In view of his statement the indications thus are that, subject to the Germans Being able to come to an agreement with the Governments oi India and of Siam, we shall soon see a Lufthansa service in operation between Berlin and Bangkok connecting with China through the intermediary of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, and else with Japan through that of the Japanese line the establishment of which is under contemplation provided that landing facilities /4 facilities are accorded at Hoiig Kong and in Indo-China 'by ourselves and oy the French., 5* Whilst I am about it, 1 would report here a recent conversation between myself and the French Minister, Monsieur Ldpissiero My colleague said that Air France was still operating itc services 'via Siam without any formal agreement having been concluded with the Siamese Government&lt;= A con vention was now in process of negotiation, but two difficulties had arisen over ito For one thing, the French company wished to reserve its right to fly to Hanoi by the Northern route from Burma, thus avoiding Siam altogether* To this the Siamese were mailing objection, as in the analagous case of Imperial Airways, and were insisting that the French services should be operated exclusively via Siam throughout the period of the Convention* The second difficulty proceeded from the desire of the Siamese to secure the right to operate a service of their own to Canton via French Indo-China* To this demand the French were agreeable, on condition that the pilots of the Siamese company should bo of either French or Siamese nationality* But the Siamese would not consent to a stipulation of that kind and the negotiations had in con sequence reached an i mpa sse* Monsieur Lepissier explained to me that, in the event of a Siamese air service to Canton being inaugurated, the Siamese machines would pass directly over the Indo-Chinese lines of defence, more especially at Fort Bayard r and that th French were accordingly apprehensive of what might happen if the Siamese were to employ pilei.s of German - Italian or Japanese nationality* ?notographs, he saxd, could be taken nowadays at incredible distances from ground- He realised that it was doubt fur whether the oj.amese would /« 5 « would in practice ever succeed in starting a service on their own account, hut the Government of Indo-China preferred to take no risks,, I observed to Monsieur Lepissier that i- 3 were taken with the Siamese, it would he difficult for the .French to accord facilities for flying into Indo-China to a Japanese air line, which would, of course - employ Japanese pilots-. My colleague admitted this difficulty-, hut could only presume that the Japanese,, if their application were entertained, would he compelled to follow some other route than the one via Fort Bayard* 6 , Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the following authorities:- The Department of Overseas Trade (by air mail); the Governor-General of India; the Governor of Burma; the Governor of the Straits Settlements; the Governor of Hong Kong; His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tokyo; His Majesty ? s Ambassador at Shanghai; the Vice-Admiral Commanding-in-Chief on the China Station; the General Officer Commanding the Troops, Malaya Command, Singapore; the Air Vice-Marshal Commanding the Royal Air Force, Far East, Singapore; the General Officer Commanding, Burma; the Chief of the General Staff, India; and the Naval and Military Attaches- Bangkok* I have the honour to be, With the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servant,Prom The Bangkok Times of April 30th, 1 938* EURASIA AVIATION CORPORATION REGULAR AIR SERVICER POR PASSENGERS, MAIL AND FREIGHT hy tri-motored Air-liners Dep.

The Air Ministry have 'been very slow about taking action on conclusion(c) of the C.I.D.^hut after persistent pressure from the Foreign Office and the India Office they have at length produced the letter of 9th June 'below, enclosing a draft letter in reply to the German Government’s application of 12th March last (flagged) for facilities in India and Burma for an air service to the Far East. It will 'be noticed that the Air Ministry draft letter does not refer at all to the question of co-opaation 'between Imperial Airways and Eurasia in China in spite of the fact that the C.I.D and the Cabinet gave particular attention to this point (see the concluding words of conclusion(c) as amended by the Cabinet). The reason for this, as stated in the Air Ministry letter of 9th June is that the Eurasia Corporation is not a German concern and German influence in it seems to he declining. I d not think that we should offer any comments on this ; question in replying to the Air Ministry. It will he for Sir Xingsley Wood to explain to the C.I.D. and the Cabinet why he has not felt able to adhere strictly to their recommendations.

I have now the pleasure of informing you that, with the object of meeting the wishes of the German Government, permission lor the tutaOlie ment of the service across India and burma along the route mentioned above will be granted, on the understanding that the German Government, actingI 2 - in the same spirit, will he good enough to grant reciprocal facilities when sought for the development of British air services^elsevvhere* 4* As regards the fifth paragraph of your letter, I would observe that the permission granted to foreign air transport companies at present operating over the route in question does net extend to the eruharkation of passengers or goods at one point in India or Burma for conveyance to another point in India or Burma, and it hc,s been ascertained that the Governments of India and Burma would be unable to make an exception in favour of Deutsche Lufthansa* 5* If the arrangement set out in paragraph 5 above is acceptable to the German Government, the formal permission of the Governments of India i and Burma for the operation of the German service across their respective territories will be communicated to you through the diplomatic channel.

In the course of a short discussion, it was suggested that the present position resulted from the fact that the Govt.of India had not developed its air routes. The Prime Minister said that that was a larger questioi which, if raised, would have to be brought up as a separate issue.

[E 2857/235/34] Copy No. 114 Mr. Butler to Viscount Halifax.—(Received May 17.) (No. 160.) My Lord, Tehran, Afril 22, 1938. WITH reference to the unnumbered telegram to you of the 1st April from His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul, I have the honour to state that the regular weekly service of the Lufthansa between Berlin and Tehran can now be said to be definitely established. The first aeroplane on the regular service left Tehran for Berlin on the 5th April, and the service has functioned regularly since then. It is understood, however, that the Lufthansa have not yet negotiated a written agreement with the Iranian Government regarding the service, and it is said that permission has to be obtained for each separate flight. 2. The aeroplane leaves Berlin on the outward journey at 12-30 a.m. each Friday (i.e., during the night of Thursday to Friday) and arrives in Tehran at 6-40 a.m. on each Saturday morning. Stops are made at Belgrade, Athens, Rhodes, Damascus and Bagdad. On the return journey the aeroplane leaves Tehran at about 4 p.m. on each Tuesday and reaches Berlin at 7 p.m. on the following day. Only four passengers are carried; their seats enable them to lie down. The fares from Berlin are as follows: To Belgrade, 135 reichsmarks; to Athens, 238 reichsmarks; to Rhodes, 300 reichsmarks; to Badgad, 650 reichsmarks; and to Tehran, 850 reichsmarks. The fare from Tehran to Berlin is 5,480 rials (£68 10.9. at the official rate of exchange). The fare can be paid in rials. 3. The German aeroplane leaves Tehran on the same day each week as the aeroplane of the Iranian air service to Bagdad. It is, therefore, not surprising that the German service should not he allowed to take in at Tehran mails, passengers or freight for Bagdad. Nor may any outward mail be carried from Tehran, though it is believed that the aeroplanes bring mail from Berlin. All outward air mail from Tehran is carried by the Iranian service. It is understood that mail for Europe is transferred to the Lufthansa aeroplane at Bagdad on Tuesday evenings, except for mail for the United Kingdom, which is forwarded by Imperial Airways. 4. The service is not yet running regularly to Kabul. _ • r* , i • i j l ^ O ^ I Arwnmm Ain 5.

This aspect of the question has been exhaustively examined by the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the India Office, and as a result it is felt by the Air Ministry and the India Office that in the altered circumstances it would be desirable, for the following reasons, to grant the German request without referring to any such condition or “ understanding ” : — (1) It is no longer practicable to oppose a German service as far as Kabul; (2) In present circumstances, in view of Soviet influence in Sinkiang and the physical difficulties of flying across the Pamirs, especially in winter, there is little likelihood that the Germans will, in fact, be able to extend their Afghan service across Sinkiang, at any rate for some time to come; (3) To ask the Germans to give up the idea of such a service is therefore unnecessary at the present time, and it would detract from the value of our offer of facilities in India and Burma as a gesture of goodwill to the German Government; (4) If the offer of these facilities were made in any way conditional on the relinquishment of any German plans for flying in, or through, Afghanistan, it would be necessary beforehand to inform the Afghan Government of the condition (otherwise they might easily hear of it first from the Germans), and the Afghan Government would be very likely to resent our bargaining with a third Power in a matter which they would regard as primarily their own concern; (5) It is to our ^advantage to encourage the Germans to build up “vested inteiests on the Indian route which Great Britain could control in case of war; (6) An unconditional offer still seems the best means of diverting the Germans from any future intention of developing the Sinkiang route m co-operation with the Japanese; (7) The adoption of this course might create German goodwill and enable us to secure reciprocal facilities from them in other quarters when lequue 01 the development of British Air Services.

Minutes of the 300th Meeting—Minute 10.) THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Secretaries of State for India and Air on the subject of German Penetration in the Far East in the field of civil aviation. (C.I.D. Paper No. 1429-B.) LORD ZETLAND said that when this matter first came before the Committee last June, it had been agreed “ that, since it is a strategic interest to keep both Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to “needing landing facilities either the Germans or the Russians.” Acting on this he had done what he could to discourage the Afghans from granting c oncessio ” s ^ hl , c . 1 l we , r t e view the Germans but he had foreseen that this would be difficult. With a view therefore to diverting the Germans from developing ^ .Ctentral A^an route via Afghanistan to the Ear East, it had been agreed with the Secretary of btate tor Air that the Germans should be offered transit facilities across India and Burnuu This proposal had been put to General Milch on “ c f;° n ^ h the Cev e r he German Air Force Mission to this country last October w t^ however the important qualification-which had been made dear to General Milch ^that^ offer was conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul lout . ond that the that General Milch was ignoring the conditional cha^ that the Germans were working for both the Kabul an oppose the German while, the Afghans had found it impossible to 1^ and Iran, requests, in view of similar requests which ha d be g rv i Y ce to Kabul. In and they had therefore decided to permit a weekly difficult pro blem of recom- these altered circumstances he had been faced with J^ catk) P which had been mending what reply ought to be made to ^ ^ rch for trans it facilities received from the German Governme 1T . arrmiescence should be made con- across India, and, in particular, whe er o q Kabul route, as we had ditional on the abandonment by the had agreed with the originally intended that it should be. Ver {J e A\A D ^ ra ^ ra ph (1) to (7) of the Secretary of State for Air, for the reasons ^ o-Ated unconditionally.

Thus, the arguments were very evyly danced, that he had referred the matter to th ^ Ministry LORD SWINTON said that this The whole question had must take the advice of the Foieign a erde p ar t men tal Committee on n ^ been thoroughly thrashed out y chairmanship of Sir Warren IS _ ^ national Air Communications undei he t djsa eab le as it was, it was This Committee had come to the conclusion tna [17212—1Jnot practicable to refuse the German request. He had done his best to persuad ( General Milch and had. in particular, emphasised the disadvantages and danJ of the Kabul route, but, as we had reason to know, Milch was not to be trulei We were now faced with the fait aecomfli that the Germans had obtained their licence from the Afghans, following the precedent of Iraq and Iran We were hardly in a position to tell the Germans that we would not allow them acro» India unless they “cleared out” of Afghanistan, and there was therefore lit tle to be Gained by refusal. On the other hand, there^ remained the fact that ,v ( were still very anxious to prevent the projection of the German service eastwards beyond Kabul through Sinkiang and Central Asia to link up with the Japanese' By giving the Germans transit facilities across India there seemed at leasts (1 UUL UJ. uriclCiUre i] to be gained by 'refusal. On the other hand, there remained the fact that*. anxious to prevent the projection of the German service eastwards through c By giving the Germans uxcinoiu . ^ icasi a hope of delaying, if not of diverting them, from the Sinkiang route. Furthermore as a matter of principle, he would like to lepeat his conviction that it was an illusion to suppose that we could go on indefinitely denying foreigners the freedom of the air for the development of civil aviation, any more than of the sea. For these reasons he felt that more harm than good would be done by refusing the German request. SIR ROBERT VANSITTART explained that the Foreign Office view was that it seemed illogical in principle that, having agreed, as we originally had that we should allow the Germans transit facilities across India on condition that they withdrew from Afghanistan, we should now allow them the best of both worlds. The recommendation in favour of this was based on the argument contained in paragraph (6) of the Memorandum, i.e., that “an unconditional offer still seemed the best means of diverting the Germans from any future intention of developing the Sinkiang route in co-operation with the Japanese” He himself had always been sceptical about the validity of this argument and his doubts had recently been confirmed by reliable information that the Germans intended to go on developing the Sinkiang route. He therefore suggested that we should reply to the German request either that w T e now understood that they were proposing to develop the Kabul-Sinkiang route and that we therefore presumed that they would not want the Indian route, or, alternatively, that we would grant them air transit facilities across India subject to our o-etting equivalent facilities, e.g., in connection with the Eurasia Company. SIR WARREN FISHER explained that his Committee had been over this ground again and again. They would have liked to suggest that we should impose restrictions on Germany. As regards Kabul, this was impossible; as regards India it was difficult by reason of the fact that we had already granted similar facilities to other foreign countries. One strong argument in favour of encouraging the development of a German air line through India was that it would be at our mercy in case of war. Furthermore, we were anxious to divert H , other s P heres 01 influence which we were particularly anxious to n f “ s ? lves ' the Atlantic. It had been suggested that Tbl n g f a h , 1 Germ ? ns the , rl g ht t° cross India, we should demand a quid mo quo. the ^ossihG ayS r dld ' . C ° nslde ration was at the moment being given to conceivable that th, K p ° 0U1 ^ y |Y ’P e y Mr services to Vienna, and it was thev wo^ld nnfleh h ffn' 8 rai gp J nlak T e difficulties.

LORD ZLI LAND pointed out that it had been the consistent policy of the Government of India to maintain the North-West frontier as a “ prohibited area. He felt that the suggestion for a reversal of this policy raised an issue which was too large and complicated to be considered at the moment. “ SIR 1HOMAS IN SKIP said that the discussion had clearly shown that we were not m a position to stop the Germans going to Kabul, and that, on balan« it appeared preferable to tell the Germans that we were prepared to offer them transit facilities across India, subject to an engagement from them that we should obtain such reciprocal facilities elsewhere as we might require from them Conclusions.

A reduction of 20 per cent, is made on return tickets. The machines fly regularly on to Kabul, but the carrying of passengers to and from the Afghan capital has not yet been officially authorised. This is expected at a very early date. The extension of this air line to the Far East is foreshadowed as soon as conditions there become normal. The journey from Tehran-Berlm normally takes twenty-seven hours, the service would, therefore, appear to be one of the world’s fastest. It is understood that Deutsche Lufthansa intend employing machines with accommodation for forty passengers, and with a cruising speed of 200 m.p.h., later in the year. No mails or passengers may, at present, be conveyed by this air line between Tehran and Bagdad, as this would compete with the Iranian State Air Line now operating between Tehran-Kermanshah-Bagdad. It is understood that numbers of Europeans and Iranian passengers have already booked passages to Berlin by this line. H. J. UNDERWOOD, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military A ttache.

As recently as 13th March last the Minister reported that, though he had not lately discussed with Afghan Ministers the general attitude of the Afghan Government to this service, he saw no reason to suppose that it had changed since last year, when his impression had been ’'that, while some of the younger generation would be glad to open Afghanistan to foreign air services, the more responsible members of the Government were chiefly anxious to avoid the establishment of a regular Soviet air service, which they feared would be the outcome of any concession granted to the Germans. Tney would thus have been glad of any means of objection to conceding landing facilities and H.M. Charge d 1 Affaires at Kabul was ’Affaires and H.M. Minister have done whatescape from the German proposals if a way could he found without offending the German Government”. Later telegrams from Kabul of 14th and 21st April have, however, revealed a change in the attitude of the Afghan Government. The Afghan Prime Minister indicated to Colonel fraser- Tytler on 12th April that this changevas due to the fact that the Afghan Government no longer had the same fear of Soviet reactions and to the effect of the Saadabad Pact, which had. caused the Afghan Government to endeavour to orient their foreign policy in accordance with that of their co-signatories, Iraq, and Iran, who for their part have now granted facilities for the German service. Colonel Fraser-Tytler warned the Afghan Prime Minister regarding the possible motives underlying the German request for facilities from the Afghan Government, but in his telegram of 14 th April he expressed a doubt whether the Prime Minister would be able, even if he wished, to resist the pressure of the German request plus the natural desire of the younger Afghans to have so direct a link with Europe. The Foreign Minister has since informed Colonel Fraser-Tytler that the Afghan Government proposed to follow the example of Iran by permitting a weekly service to Kabul, a sep arate app11cation for/ on condition offor each flight, and has indicated that representations by the Soviet Ambassador against the German service have irritated the Afghan Government and stiffened their determination to grant facilities. In the light of this information it seems clear that we should only antagonise both the Afghans and the Germans by any further attempt to oppose the German service to Kabul. It seems, therefore, expedient to acquiesce in this service with as good a grace as possible. Meanwhile, following on the conversation between the Secretary of State for Air and General Milch on 18th October last recorded in C.I.D. paper 1360-B, the German Government have on 12th March, submitted an official application to His Majesty's Government for transit facilities on the usual route across India and Burma for a German air service to the Bar Bast, with a terminus for the present at Bangkok. It will be remembered that one of our objects in deciding to offer the Germans facilities on the Indian route was to divert them, if possible, from developing the Central Asian route via Afghanistan and Sinkiang to link up with the Japanese in the Pan Bast. Although the Germans are starting flights via Tehran to Kabul, while simultane ously/simultaneously applying to us for facilities on the southern route across India and Burma for a service following the coast of the Persian Gulf it may be hoped that the grant of the latter facilities would greatly diminish any incentive which they might otherwise have for pressing on with the develoiment of the difficult Central Asian route to the Par East.

This aspect of the question has been exhaustively examined by the foreign Office* the Air minist-*.3- and the India Office, and as a result it is felt that in the altered circumstances it would be desirable, for the following reasons, to grant the German request without referring to any such condition or ”understanding”:~ (1) It is no longer practicaole to oppose a German service as far as xauu.1, (3) In present circumstances, in v±-^; of Soviet influence in Sinkiang and the physical difficulties of flying across the Pamirs, especially in winter, there is/is little likelihood that the Germans will in fact he able to extend their Afghan service across Sinktang, at any rate for sorne time to come; (o) fo ash the Germans to give up the idea of such a service is therefore unnecessary at the present time, and it would detract from the value of our offer of facilities in India and Burma as a gesture of good will to the German Government; (4) If the offer of these facilities were made in any way conditional on the relinquishment of any German plans for flying in, or through, Afghanistan, it would be necessary beforehand to inform the Afghan Government of the condition (otherwise they might easily hear of it first from the Germans), and the Afghan Government would be very likely to resent our bargaining with a third Power in a matter which they would regard as primarily their own concern: (5) It is to our advantage to encourage the Germans to build up ’'^esled interests n on the Inciian route whicn Great Britain could control in caco ox war; ( 6 ) An unconditional offer still seems the best means of diverting the Gtniaans from any future invention of uevolo^ino the Sinkiang route in co-operation witn the/Jit L.

It is suggested that this matter might be put before the C.I.D. at its meeting next week, end the draft of a memorandum is submitted. There is also flagged on the file a longer and more involved F.O. draft, which had been prepared before the latest developments occurred; it is therefore somewhat out of date, and moreover its presentation of the case is not quite accurate. We understand, however, that they would 4 prefer the submission to the C.I.D. to be in the form of their draft memo. Both drafts lead up to the same conclusions, namely, (a) that we should not take any further action at Kabul towards stimulating opposition on the part of the Afghan Govt, and (b) that in replying to the Germans about the Indian route we should make no mention of the relinquishment of their plans for flying in or through Afghanistan. It makes little difference which memo, is adopted, but I think the draft submitted is a better presentation of the case. If you approve it, perhaps we might tell the F.O. and Air Ministry that you propose to submit a memo, on these lines, leaving them to decide whether/whether to submit the longer memo, on their own account. If A i however, for any reason they should then press for submission of a joint memo., perhaps you would be willing to join in one on the lines prepared by the F.O., with such modifications as seem essential.Mr. Peel , Mr. Walton, Please see Mr. Hadow’s letter of 2nd May below. YJe have not hitherto given the Foreign Office draft memo, for the C.I.D. very detailed consideration here, because immediately on its receipt we were informed that, in view of the latest telegram from Kabul, the Air Ministry were no longer in favour of submitting the matter for a decision by the C.I.D. The objection to the Foreign Office memo, is that it is not self- contained, but requires to be read along with the long Foreign Office departmental note, which is itself not quite accurate in some respects. (Incidentally,also, it refers in one place to another Foreign Office departmental note which has not been circulated to the other Departments.) I think it would in the end be simpler for the C.I.D. to have a shorter, self-contained memo, and, since there is now no difference of view between the various Departments as to policy, it surely should not be impossible - in spite of pressure of work in the Air Ministry - to secure agreement in such a memo, before Thursday week, which is the date of the next/next meeting of the C.I.D. I attach a tentative draft memo. If, however, you think we should defer to the views expressed in Mr. Hadow’s letter we must, I think, suggest extensive amendments in the Foreign Office draft: for example, it surely ought to mention the efforts made at Kabul to carry out the C.I.D. conclusion of 17th June by encouraging the Afghans to maintain their refusal of facilities for the Germans. Para. 3 of the Foreign Office memo., which repeats a paragraph in their departmental note, does not seem to give quite an accurate description of the instructions issued by the Foreign Office, and in any case, I am not sure that it is strictly relevant to the question at issue.157/34) \ H I ( 4 0 H- jl 15.

Dear Crombie, Hearing from you that the Secretary of State for India had decided me ye to accept in principle the proposals put forward at the inter-departmental meeting on the 20th April with regard to the German air services to Kabul and the Far East but that he felt that the questions raised should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence for their decision, I consulted the Air Ministry (Galpin) with regard to the draft memorandum for submission to the C.I.D. which ?/as sent to the India Office and Air Ministry under cover of my letter of the 21st April. Pressure of work, especially in the Air Ministry, and a paramount need for replying v/ithout further delay to the German Government as regards the trans-Indian service if - as was hoped - we are to get any kudos ^hat soever out of our conciliatory move, made us both feel that/ :• Crombie, Esq., India Office.that this draft might, if you agree, stand (subject to any mwaor alterations you may feel to be essential; with the following alterations:- A.

Might I know whether these suggestions are agreed to, and if so, whether we may take it that the memorandum will be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence at its next meeting, which I believe will take place on Thursday,'Tith May, with the joint concurrence of the three Departments concerned?I am s ending a copy of this letter to Galpin for the information of the Air Ministry, and enclose a spare copy for the Burma Office.DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR THE C.I.D. The C.I.D. agreed on 17th June, 1937:- ”That since it is a strategic interest to keep both Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities to either the Germans or the Russians.” and H.M. Charge d^ffaires at Kabul was instructed accordingly in a despatch of 15th July, 1937. There has been frequent correspondence with Kabul on the subject since that date, and both the Charge d*Affaires and H.M. Minister have done what was possible to discourage the Afghans from granting landing facilities to the Germans. As recently as 13th March last the Minister reported that, though he had not lately discussed with Afghan Ministers the general attitude of the Afghan Government to this service, he saw no reason to suppose that it had changed since last year, when his impression hadbeen ’’that, while some of the younger generation would be glad to open Afghanistan to foreign air services, the more responsible members of the Government were ohiexlj' anxious to avoid the establishment of a regular Soviet air service, wnich they feared would be the outcome of oxiy concession granted to the Germans, xxiey would thus have been glad of any means of escape/escape from the G-erman proposals if a way could he found without offending the German Government'. Later telegrams from Kabul of 14th and 21st April have, however, revealed a change in the attitude of the Afghan Government. The Afghan Prime Minister indicated to Colonel Fraser- Tytler on 12th April that this change was due to the fact that the Afghan Government no longer had the same fear of Soviet reactions and to the effect of the Saadabad Pact, which had caused the Afghan Government to endeavour to orient their foreign policy in accordance with that of their co-signatories, Iraq and Iran, who for their part have now granted facilities for the German service. Colonel Fraser-Tytler warned the Afghan Prime Minister regarding the possible motives underlying the German request er facilities from the Afghan Government, but in his telegram of 14th April he expressed a, doubt whether the Prime Minister would be able, even if he wished, to resist the pressure of the German request plus the natural desire of the younger Afghans to have so direct a link with Europe. The Foreign Minister has since informed Colonel iraser-lytler that the Afghan Government proposed to follow the example of Iran by permitting a weekly service to Kabul, on condition of a separate application for/Jr 1C ^y^n C, jy^ ^ k *U+*l for each flight, and has indicated that representations by the Soviet Ambassador against the German service have irritated the Afghan Government and stiffened their determination to grant facilities. In the light of this information it seems clear that wo aro-virfeunlly 'fac^d with-ar 4ait aooom^li . 'and tftat we should only antagonise both the Afghans and the Germans by any further attempt to oppose the German service to Kabul. It seems, therefore, expedient to acquiesce in this service with as good a grace as possible. Meanwhile, following on the conversation between the Secretary of State for Air and General u ilch on 18th October last recorded in C.I.D. paper 1360-B, the German Government have at last, on 12th March, submitted an official application to H.M.G. for transit facilities on the usual route across India and Burma for a German air service to the Far East, with a provisional terminal at Bangkok. It will be remembered that^our objectjin deciding to offer the Germans facilities on the Indian route was to divert them, if possible, from developing the Central Asian route yia Afghanistan and Sinkiang to link up with tne Japanese in the Far East. ^ 11- must— be admi k &gt; in so far as Afghanistan is^pcticerned, this policy has notjpnolfed successful, since the Gepas^s are on the point of est€tWlching a service while/ i 1 J .^ j 4.

There has been constant correspondence with Kabul since that date, and the Charge d’Affaires and the Minister have, I think, done what was possible to discourage the Afghans from granting the facilities. On 11th March we consulted the Minister as to the possible reactions of t the Afghans if we were to inform them (a) that we had received an informal enquiry from the Germans about trans-India facilities, and (b) that we proposed to make their grant conditional on the relinquishment of the German service to Kabul. The Minister in his reply of 13th March gave the opinion that, if the Afghan Govt.’s attitude were still what it had been, they would welcome a communication of this kind, as the more responsible members of the Govt, were chiefly anxious to avoid a regular Soviet air service, which they feared would be the outcome of any concession granted to the Germans; at the same time, he thought that/that before any such reply were made to the German Govt., Lhe Afghan Govt, should be taken into our confidence, as ) their susceptibilities are always, of course, aroused if matters concerning them are discussed with any other government over their head. The Minister’s later telegrams of 14th and 21st April, however, indicate clearly that it would be a mistake for us to stimulate the Afghan Govt, further to opposition to a German service.- The Minister rightly put the Afghan Prime Minister on his guard regarding possible German motives, but it is clear that the latter no longer has the same fear of Russian reactions, and the Minister doubts whether he will be able, even if he wishes, to resist the German request, especially in view of the natural liking of younger Afghans for the idea of an air link with Europe. More over, the Soviet Ambassador, who has requested that the German service should not be permitted, has been snubbed. In the light of the last two telegrams it is clear, 1 think, that we should only burn our fingers if we took any further action at Kabul. Moreover, if we sought to impose a condition^as regards Afghanistan in our offer of trans-India facilities to the Germans, this might also well get us int^ trouble/&amp;&gt; trouble with the Afghan Govt., apart from the other objections to making such condition which are felt so strongly by the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office. In these circumstances it is submitted that *y fi*'*)*-Jr we concur in the present proposals of the other ** ^ . two Departments stated in the minute belowj that, they no longer think it necessary to submit the case ' the C.I.D., we need not press for this to be done. 9UJiute Paper. Mr. PZel . ^ l ~l( Lt Under Secretary of State, Please see Mr* Walton’s minute and the Secretary of State’s note of 21st April at Flag A. Following on the meeting held on 20th April the Foreign Office produced a draft memorandum for submission to the C.I.D. (flagged) and forwarded it for the concurrence of the Air Ministry and the India Office. But simultaneously with the receipt of the Foreign Office memorandum there arrived a further telegram from Kabul (Katodon 53 of 21st April, flagged) conveying the information that the Afghan Government definitely intended to follow the example of ^ran by permitting a weekly German service to Kabul and showing that the Afghan Government had administered a rebuff to the Soviet Ambassador for making representations against permission being granted by the Afghans for this service. The Air Ministry have informed us orally that in view of this telegram they no longer think it necessary to obtain a decision by the C.I.D. on the question whether any further action should be taken with a view to preventing or delaying the establishment of the German service to Kabul. In their view it is now too late to make any further representations to the Afghan Government on the subject, even if we wished to do so, since v/e are now virtually i aced a fait accompli . It also seems clear from the last telegram from Kabul that any such representations would be very ill received by the Afghan Government. Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Air, which is at present being sought, and to the/the concurrence of the other Departments, the Air Ministry therefore propose that a reply should now he sent to the German Government granting, in principle, facilitiep for an air service across India and Burma, for which the Germans applied officially in their letter of 12th March.' The Air Ministry deprecate making any reference in the proposed reply to the German Government to our understanding that the German trans—India service would he in substitution for their previous project of a service to the Far East across Central Asia via Sinkiang, for the following reasons:- ■&lt;r (1) A mention of this 'understanding' might detract from the value of our offer of facilities in India and Burma as a gesture of good will to the German Government. (2) In present circumstances in view of the political situation in Sinkiang and the physical difficulties there is no likelihood that the Germans will in fact he -VtjUvh/. able to maintain their Afghan service across Sinkiang to the Par East; and (3) The grant of facilities in India and Burma is in any case the best method of diverting the Germans from the Central Asian route to the Par East* since it does not seem possible that they would be able to maintain both services at the same time. In the circumstances explained it is submitted that we should concur in the action proposed by the Air Ministry Departments if this is approved by the Secretary of State for Air. Th^re appears to be no necessity to consult the Governments of India and Burma again before agreeing* m principle, to the establishment of a German air service on the Indian route, although it will probably be necessary to consult them in regard to the details of the conditions subject to which transit facilities will he granted. In this/ixmte Paper Department. 1 5319b 5000 10 3G Secretar y, political D epart ment (External), I am sending out to the Defence Department, Burma, copies of the two latest telegrams from Kabul under cover of a demi-official letter of which I attach a copy. I do not think that it will be necessary to consult the Government of Burma before returning an interim reply to the German Air Finistry agreeing in principle to the grant of transit facilities across Burma, provided that it is agreed that the Government of India will not object to such facilities across India. We have, however, promised to consult the Government of Burma before a final reply is returned, but this would only be necessary in regard to the detailed conditions subject to which the permission for transit facilities will be granted. ° ^ ,U %’*'***■ u ^ u Am y (UU. &lt;U. u oUa ttex F \*uxtA* ,&lt;3UW* OX* h*** f Ob / ^ rt ^ vVC A ^ oU /L«rv^/C&lt;^ %a-cA- ( 2 ^ ^3?- 2 - (U) To indicate to Germany that the grant of facilities for the trans-India route was dependent upon the abandonment of the Kabul schemes. (ii:l) To concentrate upon drawing Germany away from the trans-Asia (Sinhiang) route by making no conditions regarding the trans-India service in the hope that natural difficulties and the situation in China will, of themselves, postpone completion of the trans-Asia line beyond Kabul until such time as Germany realises that Japan wants all for herself in China and possibly falls out with her present partners. Mr* Ilado w then elaborated the views set out in the memorandum. As regards alternative (i), a telegram (No*49) dated 14th April had been received from His Majesty* s Minister at Kabul since the memorandum had been prepared. The purport of the telegram was that the Afghan Prime Minister had indicated to Colonel Fraser~Tytier that the attitude of the Afghan Government to a German service to Kabul had undergone e change in the past 12 months and that Colonel Fraser-Tytler doubted whether the Prime Minister would be- able, even if he wished, to resist the pressure of a Gex^man request, plus the natural desire of younger Aghans to have so direct a link with Europe. As regards alternative (ii), it was questionable r»T:oiihej.v the risk of consequential German opposition to Imperial Airways* plans in China and elsewhere was one that it was worth while running in an endeavour to prevent Germany from establishing a service to Kabul* Xt did not soon expedient to persist in an endeavour to induce the'Afghan Government to refuse permission for a Goman service to Kabul since, in the light or telegram any such attempt was likely in t he long run to be fxnxijless and the utmost that could be hoped for would ee a comparatively short delay for which in the minds of the Germans, all tne odium would attach to His Majesty 5 s Government.

An early decision was felt to be advisable in view of the need for replying, with as little as possible to the &amp; ran Ciovenrnnt's application for facilities on India and Buna in it* note of /lGerman air route to Afghanistan (to the Far ^st) through A CGMMITTlg OF BiF'SHLiL uEFKNGS meeting held on 17th June, 1957 decided that:- ^Binee it is a strategic interest to keep both 'Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should 'encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their 'objection to conceding landing facilities to either 'the Germans or the Russians. 11 Germany had however during 1957, made several trial flights to the Par Hast via Kabul, the last of which ended in detention of the airmen concerned by the Tungans in oin Kiang and involved the Government of India in some trouble and expense until their whereabouts were ascertained and they were released. It was therefore decided to make use of these difficulties - in our endeavours to deflect Germany from using the Kabul route - by encouraging German use of the xoute through India to the Par ast A visit by GSrSiUL MILCH was thought to be the best means of so doing and on 18th October, an opening having been afforded him by General Milch, the Secretary of ^t&amp;te for Air underlined the perils of the projected Afghan route to the Far &amp;ast and the danger that, ii uermany obtained this concession the Afghan Government would be unable to refuse a Russian demand for similar concessions. The oificial report on the conversation reads as iollows.- 'He (General Milch) took the opportunity of 'asking was there a practical alternative; *at about • •.'about the route across India? 'I (Secretary of State for air) said that we 'should be quite ready to consider this favourably 'if they put it up as an alternative. General Milch 'expressed his gratitude and said they would do so.' The case for claiming that the India route was to be an 'alternative' to the Afghan route to the Far East is established by the above record. Unfortunately it is not clear that;- (1) any limitation was set or suggested upon ( German establishment of a terminal Air Service to / Afghanistan, the conversation having concerned the German Air iervice to the Far East through.Aabul- Service is implied in conditions set upon the through service because the result of both services on Russia (2) The implications of the phrase 'as an alternative' used by the Secretary of State tor air were understood by General Milch as conveying abandonment of the nfghan route by Gemany as a ore requisite to grant of the trans-India concession. would bo the same]* [It could however be argued that the Terminal OP I SDIa'S statement that Germany 'Bust 'know that it is virtually * 'facilities' unfortunately it is virtually impossible for us to refuse these belief or at all events consio' imposing th Government ' unfortunately lends force to the contrary t all events considerably weakens the case for .... ^ rml standpoint as the opening letter Moreover that •••thkt this condition has been considered in Germany, For Herr Fisch merely stated that:- ^Your Minister intimated that it was unlikely *thut any hesitation would arise in granting English ^approval to German aircraft flying over British 'India.* $or does the subsequent official request of the German Air Ministry for permission to operate a Luft Hansa Service from Berlin to Bangkok ('•the present terminal for the Far ^ast Service’ 1 ) make any mention of abandonment of the Afghan through or terminal services. Whether the omission was studied or accidental play is therefore likely to be made, on the German side, of the fact that for close on five months since Herr Fisch first wrote, the German 'error’ 1 - if such it was - received no correction. Meanwhile Germany has gone ahead as fast as she can with the air Service as far as Kabul. The attitude of the AFGHAN i® ** ^_ s always with Orientals - pusillanimous. In a conversation with His Majesty's Minister at A&amp;bul tfte Afghan foreign minister explained in June 1957 that, - while not desirous of coming under German influence ’’Germany had helped Afghanistan out of economic diificulties 'and, as the relations between the two countries were purely 'economic, the Afghan Government did not wish to antagonise 'Germany by refusing a request which in itself did not seem 'of great political importance' - except for its effect mi ^fghan-Soviet relations. For a time therefore Afghanistan returned a temporising ♦. •temporising reply to German requests for permission to use the trans-Afghan route; stating that first Germany roust come to terms with Iraq. This permission Germany obtained, whereupon the consent of Iran was made a pre-condition. Now TEHRAN has, it seems, capitulated; and the Prime Minister of Afghanistan informed His Majesty's Minister n at Kabul on^fctf April that since the Pact of Saadabad Afghanistan mast taKe the same line as Iraq and Iran; felt that grant of terminal facilities at Kabul to Germany would not evofce either an outburst or a demand for reciprocal facilities by Soviet Russia; and could therefore hardly refuse what Iraq and Iran granted to Germany. His Majesty's Minister is therefore 'doubtful whether he (the 'Prime Minister of Afghanistan) will be able, even if he 'wishes, to resist pressure of German request plus natural 'desire of younger Afghans to have so direct a link with 'Europe,' The Geman Minister at Kahal has made no secret to Colonel Fraser Tytler of this progressive Geman advance towards the establishment of an Air Service^* Katml; the a 6th experimental flight for which w as &gt; jn 4*^ ^ reported by the Legation at Kabul as having left erlm. bent upon establishing . u-v That Germany is therefore P ■-* —......rrr arrangements for so doing seem Hansa representative being shortly due to discus. ^ question with the Afghan Government. From KABUL onwards Germany is faced wl i) the difficulty of flyi n £ conditions - particularly through the nanow Corridor between Soviet Russia and India; ii) ••ii) the fast that Sin Kiang is now virtually in Soviet hands and so makes establishment of landing-grounds over a long stretch of territory all but impossible; iii) a divergence of views between Germany and her partner in this enterprise, Japan, as to the route to be followed from Ansi onwards. For Japan wants to take the Northern and more direct route to Japan, while Germany has in the past favoured the mo *e profitable and easier Southern route to Shanghai; iv) there is however information of mutual concessions and co-operation between the two countries which points to agreement on the Japanese part not to press - for the time being - for concessions in Iran or further Westwards for _ Japanese aeroplanes. The Kabul link is therefore evidently being treated by JAPAN as part of a German- Japanese r frans-ASi&amp; route to the Par Hast eventually (it is hoped) to be established via Kabul and across China to Japan. But faced with the practical difficulties enumerated above GHRIMY is ior the time being - as shown in the Far Eastern Department s I memorandum - pushing forward a Luit Kansa service to B/Jfu&amp;GK for which Herr Fisch has now requested permission *&amp;s part of its plan for a Eervice to the iaT ast. Germany is also (as holding nearly half the capital of the iilrUSIA Company) interested in the Chinese Jurasia Service from China to Hangoon or Atcyab which is favourably regarded by the Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned .. •6 concerned as carrying with it possibilities ox counter vailing concessions i'or Ir:'.?-.RLiL AlR'taYS in China. It may therefore be that Germany proposes to leave the Kabul-Far -ast Section of the Trans-Asia route (via Bin Ki&amp;ng) either in abeyance for the time being or to her Japanese partner; and to press on with the trans-India connexions to China, via Bangkok in conjunction with the Surasia Company: a plan which would, if suitably encouraged, retard Japanese plans for an air-service unacceptable to mm %0m. British interest in the air-routes of the far Sast thus has an important bearing upon the question of imposing conditions as to the use of Kabul in replying to the German demand for facilities in India. for, before replying to Herr Pisch, His Majesty's Government must decide whether:- Government to obstruct or delay the German Terminal and/or through Air-Service at Kabul or b) Itself to indicate to Germany that grant of facilities for the trans-India route are dependent upon abandonment of the Kabul schemes* AS regards the FIRST AITATIVI His Majesty's Minister has already hinted on more than one occasion at the disadvantages to Afghanistan of this service and the likelihood of Russian objections or similar demands. But the Afghan Prime Minister has now clearly indicated that he does not consider Russia to be a sufficient obstacle; has stated that Afghanistan fears German economic retaliation if the service be held up; and has shewn that the younger ^progressive” elements of Afghanistan want the service. a) to continue to encourage the ifghan Afghan # • •7. VToj Afghan obstruction is therefore unlikely - whatever the further arguments or private persuasion used at Kabul, - to hold up the German Terminal service to Afghanistan for more than a few months, if at all. Thi* is also the danger, from the point of view of international relations that Germany will learn from Afghan sources opposed to British ’'dictation*' over an independent country that the real obstruction comes from. Great Britain;while the Increasing number of Italian airmen and other foreigners and the general desire for 'festernis&amp;tion* araong young Afghans further weaken the case for opposing German activities from the point of view of foreign •penetration* into Afghanistan* The principal disadvantage of the S8CCKD ALTW, ? .TIVS that of ourselves making clear to Germany that she can only use the trans-India route if she gives up Kabul - is from a business standpoint of relative gain and loss, the risk it entails of German abandonment of the trans-India route or of German ill-will and covert opposition to Imperial Airways schemes in China and elsewhere as a result of w offence”at our conditions and attitude. A THIRD ALTKMATryB therefore presents itself: that of accepting the Kabul terminal-service as virtually an accomplished fact and, by a show of 'generous co-operation such as grant of the trans-India concession without any 'strings' or restrictions - to endeavour both to obtain countervailing advantages for Imperial Airways elsewhere and also to postpone the Trans-Asia (Sin Kiang) project by establishing or increasing German 'vested interests' in the Southern air-routes to China (which Great Britain can at all ! N : I8 . tir.es control) while yet the trans-^sia route bristles with difficulties, is excessively costly, and of value, relatively speaking, only to Japan. The objection to this lere sutpine policy is that it does not keep Otnu&amp;ny out of Afghanistan as laid down in the COBiiiittee of Imperial Defence minute quoted at the beginning of the Memorandum. ^— But by approving the conversations with General Milch the Committee of Imperial Defence virtually recognized the force of the subsequent instructions sent to His Majesty’s representatives at Baghdad, Tehran and Bangkok, an Kovenbcr 19B7, to withdraw their opposition to Germany on the ground that 'it was felt to be impossible 'to block indefinitely the general German project for 'an air line to the Far Test and that it would be 'preferable, if possible, to secure some degree of control 'over it rather than to incur the hostility and possible 'retaliation of toe German authorities by opposing their 'plansSecret. .Z. 3613/38.

Department. German Air Service to the Far East - Secretary of State . Since you saw the file we have had the letter of 19th .pril below from the F.O. enclosing a memorandum. This iscusses three possible courses (1) to encourage the Afghan Govt, to obstruct or (2) to indicate to the German Govt, that the grant of facilities in India is dependent upon abandonment of the service in Afghanistan; (3) that we should make no conditions which might lead the Germans to reject the offer of a trans-India service, trusting that if they settle down on this they will not proceed with the very difficult Central Asia project. The F.O. letter expressed a preference for the third course, and suggested the preparation of a paper ior the C.I.D. explaining recent developments and the reason for the adoption of this course. In the discussion at the meeting yesterday both the F.O. and the Air Ministry were very definite in advocating course (3) for the following reasons, ihe telegram from Kabul of 14th April shows pretty clearly that the Afghan Govt, are not likely to object to a German service to Kabul, especially as their fear of Soviet reactions has been very considerably diminished; it is, therefore, nob likely that we should succeed in persuading, .hem -o any effective opposition, and the attempt to do so entails the risk of the Afghans placing the onus upon us for sucn half-hearted, opposition as they might put up. As regards course (2), the F.O. and Air Ministry feel strongly that delay a concession for a terminal or transit service in Afghanistan; 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,600 9.37 10P it/6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 lOP A V, U Lnute Paper. Department. it is to our interest to admit the Germans to the trans- Indian route (and that consequently our offer of it should be unconditional) , among other reasons because it would be under our control and because we may require the co operation of the Germans (i.e., the Eurasia Coy. in China, which is largely under German control) in regard to the important plans for reciprocal rights for Imperial Airways to fly in the interior of China. Both the other Depart ments were even opposed to our making any reference, when replying to the Germans about the Indian route, to an understanding, as distinct from a firm condition, in regarc to the relinquishment of the service in Afghanistan. The point they (especially the F.O.) emphasised was that any reference to this would 'spoil the gesture' of the offer of facilities in India and deprive it of some of its value. I emphasised the political objections to a German service in Afghanistan pointed out in your minute of 17th April. The other Departments were very decidedly of opinion, however, that we should not attempt to make any condition even in a wrapped up form, or take further steps to encourage Afghan opposition, in view especially of the fact that we cannot ourselves prevent the Germans having a service to Kabul if the Afghan Govt, agree, and the improbability of our being able to persuade the latter to withhold their consent. It was decided that a memorandum should be drafted for the C.I.D., suggesting the adoption of course (3)' in the F.O. memorandum. This will be drafted by the F.O. (in consultation with us and the Air Ministry), and the draft will shortly be submitted for your consideration. I reserved the India Office attitude as to whether we should ageee m it as a joint memorandum or alternatively put in a separate memorandum.C4tice, a.w.x, April, U36.

German Minister had however informed him that this was so and that representative of Lufthansa Company would shortly arrive in Kabul.to discuss prolongation of line to Kabul, i 3. As to attitude of Afghan Government, Prime Minister indicated that it had altered in past twelve months. Signing of the Saadabad pact had caused Afghan Government to endeavour to orient their foreign policy in accordance with that of their cosignatories. Consequently if Iraq, and Iran gave transit facilities it would be very difficult for Afghan Government to refuse to allow service to Kabul. 4* Chief obstacle to grant of facilities had been probable attitude of Sov5,et Government- Afghan Government had however noticed that Iranian Government took little account nowadays of Soviet reactions as determining factor in their policy. Afghan Government were similarly inclined to the view that Soviet policy was at present essentially pacific and passive and that grant of terminal facilities for German se3 ^ icc H'L kJ 4 . , 18 APR 1938 INDIA OFFICElto Kabul would probably act evoke outburst .from the Soviet Government or a strong demand for.reciprocal facilities* 5* Prime Minister then enquired what view His Majesty*s Government took of the motives underlying German request, ^Service obviously could not pay.

Z. 2187/38) for transit facilities in India and Burma for an air service* with^provisioni&amp;w ^ terminal at Bangkok. Secret information suggests that the Germans intend to extend this service to Japan along the South China coast in collaboration with the Japanese, making use of landing grounds on certain Chinese Islands which have 'been seized by the Japanese. The indications at present are that the German Government are also attempting at the same time to develop an air service •/&gt; to Kabul (possibly with the intention of extending it later to the Par East across Sinkiang, should conditions become favourable for such a service). It will be remembered that when the Germans were informed that H.M.G. would consider favourably an application for a German service on the southern route across India and Burma, it was hoped that we might thereby divert them from their project for a service by the Central Asian route across Afghanistan and Sinkiang. Our objections to the latter service were pointed out by the Secretary of State for Air in his conversation with General Milch on 18th October last. 0 Our objections to a German service to Af ghanista terminating at Kabul were not so clearly indicated in that conversation, though the argument used by Lord Swinton that^if the Germans were to establish a service in Af ghanistan^the Afghan Government could not refuse/2 . refuse similar facilities to the Russians, would apply equally in the case either of a transit service through Afghanistan or a terminal service to Kabul. (It was contemplated at that time by the Departments here that it should be intimated to the German Government that our offer of facilities in India and Burma y/as made on the understanding tfyat the Germans would no longer desire to obtain facilities either transit or terminal at Kabul, but this policy does not appear to have -been definitely approved by higher authorijty). ^ T ^ e question which must now be decided is the extent to which, in replying to the German application, it is desirable to insist that our offer of facilities m India and Burma is conditional on the abandonment by the German Government of any air service either ■—- oush A: fGhanistan to the Par East or terminating at abul# our objections to a German service to Kabul only, to be what the Germans are at present aiming at, are not perhaps so strong as our objections to a transit service through Afghanistan along the northern frontiers of India to the Par East. The main objection seems to be the one already mentioned that the establishment of such a service would probably lead to the result + . regularisation of tin. Soviet service to Kabul. It ^t also result in a furthjr increase of Geman economic penetration into Afghanistan which might not be in accordance with our i nterests , and there is the further danger that it might at time become possible for the German* + ^ ns to extend the which appears s is present service across Sinkiang to the Par Fa*+ + - at -w, jast, though thi not likely^m the near future in view of the extent of Soviet influence in Sinki an g ^ 3, It is suggested that the line to be 1 - , e taken in re-nitn*^ to the Germans should larpelv -h Q ^ ^ prying ^ be determined in ^ , . rn ohe light ^/\ ji&gt;LxrLCe__ a. a ^fil Ccndhi6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 lOP Minute Paper Department. ~) V p y Katodon 30 P.Z. 1703 / 38 . of the present attitude of the Afghan Government to a German service^. The Minister at Kabul recently reported (Katodon 30 of 13 th March at P.Z. 1703/38) N wfijilz chfCu.fJJU) i_ /^uw^sT&amp;vy ) thatyhe had no^^eason to suppose that the atTitude of the Afghan Government had changed since last year when his impression had been that while some of the ) younger generation would be glad to open Afghanistan to foreign air services the more responsible members ) of the Government were chiefly anxious to avoid the establishment of a regular Soviet air service which they -■eti fear^ would be the outcome of any concession granted to the Germans. At the suggestion of the Foreign Office x a telegram was sent to Kabul on 9th April instructing 'Ter n****jvt*\. Colonel Fraser-Tytler ^ ascertain more precisely the present viev/s of the Afghan Government. If the Afghan Government now show signs of being in favour of the Kabul service it would certainly seem » very bad policy on our part to attempt to persuade the Germans to abandon it as a condition of the grant 01 facilities in India. Such action could only have the effect of offending both the Germans and the Afghans. Cm, «t fob * There would seem no objection in this case to intimating to the Germans our understanding that the service across India would be in substitution for the through service via Central Asia to the Far East which they ^originally contemplated. 4. on the other hand if it still appears that the Afghan Government would be 'glad of a means 01 escape from the German proposals if a way could be found without offending the German Government'', we saay in these circumstances/BlBUWlCTgg' lie circumstances perhaps go as far as to info™ the Germans] without making it an express condition of our granting permission for the Indian route^that our understanding is on the basis of the Swinton-Milch conversation y that the Indian route would he an alternative to the route to the Par East via Afghanistan and Sinkiang, to which we had indicated our objections, and that we assumed that the Germans also did not now intend to pursue ^he idea, of* a ■terrniiis.l service to Kabul (wfiich tbe ; -ermaji Minister at Kabul had recently UJHty****# to the British Minister as a possibility). We might intimate that the latter question was of course principally a matter for t Afghan Government with whose decision we would not wish fv ' ' to interfere, though we still feared that a German service to Kabul might lead to the establishment of a regular Soviet service. At the same time we could also inform the Afghans of what we were proposing to say to tthe Germans, in the hope that our offer of the Indian route might make it easier for the Afghan Government to oppose the German application for a Kabul service. 6. The offer of the Indian route is not a particularly strong bargaining counter. The French and the Hutch already fly across India, so that we cannot very well make too many difficulties over granting permission oo die Germans without seeming to be unreasonable. The is apparently no particular objection to a German -oi^ce m India and there is a strategic advantage in the eVent 0f war or emergency in that the Germans would nave become dependent on facilities under our (thouga no doubt m the^ca^e of war German be interrupted re 1C service to the Par East could in Iraq or Syria). u ’# ZS'll/sg n t-K Li IS J ertrV L * Cnsl^ &lt;W&lt;A tihDEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION, Tel.

Dear Walton, With reference to your letter of the 7th instant (PZ.2316/38) about the proposed German air services in and through Afghanistan, I am enclosing herewith a memorandum setting out the position as we see it at the Air Ministry. This memorandum has been agreed with the Air Staff, but has not yet been approved by higher authority I think, however, that there is not much likelihood of any substantial alteration of the Air Ministry viewpoint Yours sincerely, J.C. Walton, Esq.., G.B. , M.G. , India Office, S. W. 1.I amim air s.srvicss in and ov^e Afghanistan. (Air Ministry Memorandum) The decision to offer the Germans facilities for an air service to the Far East across India and Burma was prompted hy our desire to keep them out of Afghanistan, if possible, and to induce them to abandon, in favour of a route under British control, their project to operate a regular service from Babul across Sin-Kiang to China, In the conversations with General Milch, therefore, the Secretary of State for Air pointed out the physical and political difficulties of this latter route which traversed a sphere of Soviet influence, the fact that incidents m the operation of the service were bound to arise with resulting requests for our assistance, and that violations of the prohibited area on the north-west frontier of India would be bound to re-occur. He also told General Milch frankly that, if the Germans were to establish a route through Afghanistan, the Afghan Government could not refuse access to the Russians, a sequel probably no more agreeable to the Germans than to us. Consequent upon the discussions with General Milch, the German Air Ministry was, in reply to an unofficial enquiry informed that we should be quite ready to give favourable consideration to a formal application for transit facilities for a German service by the southern route across India and *urma* to official request from the German Air Ministry has now been received for permission for the D.L.H. to operate to the Far East with a provisional terminus at Bangkok, The understanding here was that facilities in India and Burma would only he granted on the basis that their tran.1 service would be in substitution for, and not in duplication of, the one originally contemplated via Kabul and Sin-.mang. /It2* It seems, however, according to information from Kabul, that the Germans are, in addition to the proposed service to the Far East, concentrating on the establishment of a service terminating at Kabul, This would put them in a position to extend further east by the northern route whenever a suitable opportunity occurred or the occasion demanded. The question now arises whether they can be required, as a condition of being granted facilities in India and Burma, to relinquish any idea of a terminal service to Afghanistan, as well as of a transit service through Kabul. It would be difficult to make the abandonment of the Kabul terminal service an absolute condition of the grant of facilities in India and Burma. The original conversations auite clearly related to a transit service ty the northern route, and not to a service terminating in Kabul, although the Russian argument applies equally to both. The Germans might have reason to suppose that we were now endeavouring to go back upon our offer if we make this further stipulation. There might also be considerable resentment in Kabul, particularly among the younger generation, if it became known that we were attempting in this manner to interfere with their prescriptive right to grant concessions in Afghanistan as they might think fit, and, as pointed out in the telegram from H.M. Minister at Kabul dated 1.3th March, sue i -? n wi th the German proposals might cause them to fall m regardless of the consequences. On the other hand, if the Afghan Government is immediately made aware, that the Germans are to be given transit facilities by the southern route across India and Bumna h will be in a stronger position to give a refusal themselves the German application for terminal facilitie , v, thereby blocking German further argument that they are extension to the Far Bast will lose its force. /inIn these circumstances it is suggested that it would he unwise in the official reply to the Oermans to make any reference to our object ion to the terminal service, and that it would also he undesirable even for an informal intimation of this objection to be conveyed through the Air Attache at Berlin. He could, however, be instructed to ascertain definitely from the Germans, without expressing any views on the subject, what are their precise intentions Regarding such a service* The Air Ministry view is, in short, that we are not in a good position ourselves to prevent a German terminal service to Kabul. Reliance must primarily be placed on the Afghan Government preventing the project when they imow of 1 our offer of transit facilities across India and Burma. The (most that we might do is to delay giving formal permission . c „ +hp southern route until the Afghans have for the service by the sou-one.n ovfhTprt of the terminal service, declared themselves on the subject The official reply to the German application cannot, hcweve,, be unduly delayed without giving the impression that we are breaking faith. It may be added that the original desire of the ^ . . +h tlle smo-German Company 'Surasia' Germans to effect a ImK . . the ^ar Hast service does not now appear to be their motive for the . =t in 'Burasia' has dwindled as the to Bangkok.

X Before we can send any definite reply to Herr Fisen’s letter it seems necessary to reach a final decision on the question mentioned in para. 3 of my letter, No. ( P.Z. 1340/38, of 17th March, to Darvall^whether or not it will be desirable to inform the German Government that, if facilities were granted in India and Burma, we should expect them to relinquish any idea of a terminal service to Afghanistan as well as that of a transit service through Afghanistan. It would be most useful if we could have an expression of the present views of the Air Ministry on this question. It will also be necessary to decide on the line to be taken with the Afghan Government and to send a reply to Fraser-Tytler’s telegram of 13th March, a copy of which was enclosed in my letter to Darvall. 3.

I gather that it will be proposed that it should be discussed between the Air Ministry, the India Office and the Foreign Office. It appeared to be the view of the Committee that the question of the Germans going to Kabul ought to be cleared up as the impression rather was that in offering the Germans facilities on the route across India to China, the idea was to exclude them from going to Kabul.

Since 1st March 1938, the K.L.M. and Air France have been allowed to hand over inward surcharged mails at points*along the route operated by them across India; except that letters containing dutiable goods are required to be delivered to the post offices at Karachi or Calcutta, according as the bags -re from the west or from the east. As regards outward mails, the policy of the Government of India is to utilise only Imperial Airways: the only exceptions made at present are (1) Air Mails for Iran are consigned both by the K.L.m.

In this connection, it is assumed that what the Germans have in mind is an arrangement with imperial airways that Lufthansa shall he allowed to carry passengers and goods between aointc on KarachiS-Rangoon ^it-e when, either by reason of their schedule or lack of capacity, Imperial Airways’services are not available. Recently, .just prior to the inauguration of the increased services provided by the Empire *ir Mail Scheme, public opinion compelled the Government of India to grant a temporary concession to the l.L.M. and Air Prance allowing them to carry passengers in urgent cases between India and Burma when Imperial Airways were unable to guarantee accommodation; but this concession was withdrawn with effect from the inauguration of the Emoire Air Mail Services. v 1 A JUU rv/v U, iMa vT UjibL Ms* \ OJA.

Dear Dibdin, At the meeting of the I.A.C.G. on the 16th of March it was agreed (see item 9 of the Minutes) that the^ German application for permission to operate an air service across India and Burma to the Par East should he considered inter-departmentally. (A translation of Herr Pisch s letter has since heen circulated as paper I.A.G*427). As was pointed out at the meeting, the letter makes no mention of an undertaking to abandon the Kabul route to Sinkiang and China. In regard to the fifth paragraph of the letter we were pleased to note from India Office letter of . :,Larch, No S.&amp;0.1558/38, that the Government of India, with the con- K the Government of Borne, heve Jeold.d to netnt.tn s?

It is, in fact, based on the German authorisations issued for our Air services in Europe. We would suggest that the permits for the Par Eastern service should follow the same general lines. Substantial alteration would be necessary in paragraph 1 of the statement of the conditions to be observed in the operation of the service, as_the agreement referred to there does not extend to India and Burma. The embargo on the carriage of local traffic should also appear. These permits would presumably be transmitted through the Foreign Office. I am writing in similar terms to Donaldson at the Burma Office, and am also sending a copy of this letter to Talbot, at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely,In your letter of 12th March, foo. iu.iJ.I. 52dl/33, you asked that Deutsche Lufthansa A#G« might be authorised to operate a regular air service across India and Burma to the x«'ar Bast, with a provisional terminus at Bangkok. You stated that the proposed route of the service is merlin - Belgrade - Athens - Rhodes - Damascus - Baghdad - Jasrah - Bushire - Jask - Karachi - Jodhpur - Allahabad - Calcutta - Akyab - angoon - Bangkok, with landings at the under mentioned places in India and Bui'iaaj— Karachi J odhpur Allahabad Calcutta Rangoon* 2* The application has been sympathetically considered, in consultation with the Oovernment of India and the Government of Burma, in relation to General Milch’s conversation with Viscount Swinton in London on the lith October last, when the former expressed the view that, if a route via India were available, the company would wish to use it in substitution for the difficult route vi*j Afghanistan* 3. I have now to inform you that, vith the object of meeting the wishes of the German Govern ment in this matter, and on the basis that this service would not be in duplication o.t, oat in substitution for. the one origlhally contemplated by the route via Afghanistan, the Governments of anaia /andand Burma have agreed to afford permission for the establishment of the service across India and Burma along the route mentioned above in the first paragraph. 4. As regards the fifth paragraph of your letter, I am to say that the foreign air transport companies at present operating over the route in question are not allowed to embark passengers or gooas at one point in India or Burma for conveyance to another point in India or Burma, and it has been ascertained that the Governments of India and Burma would be unable to make an exception in favour of Deutsche Lufthansa. is understood that these Governments are preparing formal permits for the operation of the service across their territories, and that these permits will shortly toe forwarded to you through the diplomatic channel.

SLA*INDIA OFFICE, HITiHALL, S.W, 1, 14th ' arch, 1938, As our Secretary of State had rot seen the papers about t ie German air service for some time, I thought it as well to take tns opportunity of submittirv: them to him with a draft letter to the idr Ministry and the draft telegram to Kabul. I enclose copy of the minute and draft letter. As you will see, the draft letter deals with the two questions (a) whether we should make a cownunication to the Germans about terminal fi cilitiec at K bul, and (h) the opportunity of doing; so. As there in a slight difference of opinion on tactics between us in regard to (b), 1 put both points of view in t ie draft letter. Could you kindly let me know if you concur in the draft? A reply has now been received from Kabul, a copy of which is enclosed, and I will enclose this also with the letter to larvall.

UJ^ u/ua &lt;tcc^ yih^tZ £ t It will oe remembered 'thab there were three reasons for offering the Germans transit facilities across * India (1) with a view to diverting them from the Afghan route, where the service would not be under our control, as it would be in India, and where there are political and strategic objections to such a service, including the probability of the Russians acquiring corresponding facilities. It was recognised, however, in the Warren Fisher Committee on 21st July last that it was by no means certain that the grant of facilities in India would induce the Germans to abandon the idea of a service to Kabul, though it was thought that it would make it easier for the Afghan Govt, to maintain their refusal; (2) the policy advocated by the Air Ministry, and 13 1 accepted by the Warren Fisher Committee, of freely admitting the air services of other Powers to our air ports, of making concessions to the Germans where this can be done without serious damage to our commercial and strategic interests, and in particular of adopting a generous air policy towards the Germans in the F.ast; (3) the strategic consideration that, if the Germans settled down to a route across India and Burma, it would be of advantage to us in the event of war or emergency that they should have become dependent on facilities under our control. The diversion of the Germans from Afghanistan was thus not the only object in view when we offered the facilities across India, though it was an important one. In/ KIn his conversation with General Milch on 18th October Lord Swinton promised that, if the Germans asked for a route across India as an alternative to the Afghan route, we would be quite ready to consider this favourably In the memorandum prepared for the conversation it was suggested that it should be intimated that we understood that if an agreement^ were reached, the Germans would no longer desire to obtain facilities, either transit or terminal, at Kabul. The point about terminal facilities may not so far have been made very explicit to the Germane, though it was,to some extent at any rate, implicit in the argument which Lord Swinton used about the difficulty which the Afghans would have in refusing access to the Russians. . J* i |i^j || :he noxnt has been raised in F.O. minutes whether we should not now make explicit the condition that, if transit facilities are granted across India, the Germans will give up even a terminal service to Kabul. It may perhaps be desirable to try to arrive at an understanding on this point at some stage in the negotiations with the Germans, though, if the Afghans and Germans agreed with each other as to a terminal service Kabul, it would obviously be difficult for us to prevent it, even perhaps*^threat of refusing the transit facilities yia India (which it would be a pity to do, in view of the other advantages to be gained by the grant of such facilities). In any case, the time and method of making a condition or seeking an understanding on this point will require careful consideration, in order to avoid frightening the Germans off the Indian route unnecessarily. e snail also havp ■frv • j nave to consider the risk of causing Afghan resentment if ”' e appear to be insisting on a/ate Paper.

As regards this point, it is proposed to consult the Minister at Kabul as m the attached draft telegram, m which the F.O. have concurred. In the light of Col, Fraser-Tytler*s reply we can consider whether we should make an intimation to the Germans in regard to the terminal service at Kabul, and the time and manner of doing so. The F.O. departments suggest that (subject, no doubt, to consideration of Col. Fraser-Tytler* s reply) such an intimation should be made as soon as possible, in order to avoid any risk of the i&gt; Germans being left under a misapprehension which might subsequently give them ground for complaint. The 1.0. departmental view is that, as we have merely promised the Germans favourable consideration of an application if made, I and they have not yet ma.de an application, there need be no great hurry about affirming (or reaffirming) our conditions^, and that in order to avoid queering the pitch unnecessarily, we had better await an opportunity, such as a communication from the Germans which would serve as a peg for any stipulation we may decide to make.

The F.0. have not received any official request from the Germap Govt, for transit facilities in India, and I believe that the position of the correspondence with the German Air Ministry is that we are awaiting a reply to Sir Francis Shelmerdine’s letter of 30th December to Herr Fisch. Recent confidential information indicates that the Germans are still interested in the possibility of developing an air service to the Far East by the southern route across India. Meanwhile you will no doubt have seen Fraser-Tytler's telegram from Kabul of 13th January (copy enclosed in 1.0. letter No. P.Z. 270/38 of 14th January^ reporting that according to the German Minister at Kabul the German Govt, care not pursuing at present the project for a German transit service through Afghanistan to China, and were concentrating on the establishment of a terminal service to Kabul. As Fraser- Tytler suggests, it is possible that the German Minister was not aware of the negotiations for an alternative German service via India, but we cannot be sure that/ 6837 Wt 34001/249 10,000 1.38that the tiermans have finally abandoned their scheme for an air service to Afghanistan. One question for consideration is whether it will not be desirable at the appropriate moment (and subject to Fraser-Tytler* s reply to the telegram which we hive addressed to him, and of which a copy is enclosed) to inform the German Govt, that if facilities were granted in India we should expect them to relinquish any idea of a terminal service to Afghanistan as well as that of a transit service through Afghani star.. If it is decided that at some stage it would be as well to make a communication in this sense to the German Govt, (whicn could perhaps best be done informally through the Air Attache at Berlin) , the next question is whether it would be preferable to wait for some favourable opportunity such as might be provided by the next communication from the Germans, e.g., the reply to Shelmerdine’s letter of 30th December to Herr Fisch, or whether, without waiting for this, the Air Attache might make an informal enquiry whether the use of the Indian route is still contemplated, and in doing so intimate the position,, as we understand it, in regard to the relinquishment of the idea of terminal as well as transit facilities/ /aft Paper Department, facilities in Afghanistan. The F.O. think that_the suggested delayed because, if it is decided to make it, and if there is a possibility that it may come as a surprise to the Germans, it would be as well to avoid giving them ground for complaint of a change of attitude on our part at the last moment. On the other hand, we at the 1.0. are inclined to think that, Germans from the India route unnecessarily, it might be questionable tactics to make such a communication by itself ’’out of the blue”, as it were; and that it would be better at any rate to wait for the next communication from the Germans. This may give us an opportunity; or if by any chance it should appear from Fisch's reply that the Germans do not want to proceed with the trans-India route, the whole question, including the need for making any conditions, will of course fall to the the Air Ministry’s views on the matter. Meanwhile you will see from the telegram to Fraser-Tytler that we are consulting him on the question of taking ,, the Afghans into our confidence at this 1 stage in regard to our negotiations with communication should not be unduly since we do not want to deter the 6837 Wt 34001/249 10,000 1.38 the/the Germans.

Since there seems to be a slight difference of opinion between the India Office and the Foreign Office in regard to the best moment for informing the Germans of the conditions which we propose to attach to our offer of facilities on the southern route to the Far Fast across India, we think this had better be made clear in writing to the Air Ministry. 2.

Shelmerdine 1 s letter to BJrr Jlsch of the oOth Jacember i« a t. vur examination of this position has given rise to the discovery that it was not sisde entirely clear to General -Jlch, during his conversation hare in Kove^nber last, thatour oiler or facilities through India was conditional on the abandonment not only of tne ^inkiang project, out also of the whole Idea of a service to Afghanistan, whether transit or terminal* te feui that the German® may now he expecting both to g«t Afghan consent to a terminal service to Kabul and to be able to claim the right to use the Indian route whenever it suits them to do so; and ao fear that f if *e do not make our position quite clear before they either secure Afghan permission for the former service or definitely apply for our permission for the latter, we may find ourselves exposed to a charge of bud faith from them (either sincere or insincere } 9 the risk of which, nowever small, should clearly be avoided if possible. It has therefore bean suggested that the Air Attache in Berlin might be asked to make an informal enquiry whether the/fciia use or tne Indian route 1 © ©till contemolatecl ana to take the opportunity to intiaaate that this is, of course, conditional on complete abundorunent of the Afghan project. At the mm® time *© might taka the Afghan Government into our confidence on this question through the Minister at Kabul, to avoid the risk of their hairing indirectly of our offer to the Germana, and being offended thereby, w© may have to drop our opposition to the terminal service to Kabul, 11 we find that it appeals etr mgiy to the Afghans; but in any case it seem© important that there should be no ail aunde rat ending about our offer for facilities to India. I am sanding a copy of this letter to Walton who concurs in its tana®#W 1 o ate Paper. Department. 5000 7 35 For Dim Off lor. a he Russian ar^umen't which ,ord winton used a plies to a German service inj as well as to one through, Afghanistan, because the former as well as the latter -ould make it difficult for the Afghan Govt, 'to refuse access to the Russians* (who 'culd li 1 e to have a regularised service to abul, but for ^hom a tr fins it service is out of the question). It was from this part of the discussion with General lilch and the fact that he readily took the point that I inferred that the Germans ’ ould understand that we saw objection to a terminal as well as a transit service. (The matter was of course dealt 'ith in the last para, of the memo, supplied to Lord Jwinton.) 1 evertheless, I agree that it 'ill probably be desirable to make some further communication to the Germans on this point at the appropriate tine find through the German ir I inistry, with whom ne ; otiations are proceeding. But it ill need to be carefully considered how the matter should be put, and it seems to me that the best opoortunity for considering; it night be the receiot of err Fisch's reply to fir F. Ghelmerline’s letter of 3Cth dec ember. If by any chance it should appear from that reply that the Germans do not want to proceed with the India route, the question of our conditions will of course fall to the ground. If, on the other hand, the reply shows that they are still interested,it will give an opportunity for making sure tliat our deside.r,,i,:a are clearly understood. e mibt, however, consult the Air Ministry on the question whether something should be said to the Gennans now/now, or whether re should await the next German move, 1 think that in any cane now we might consult CoJ Fraser-Tytler on the question of taking the Afghans into our confidence at this stage, in order to avoid any complaint later on from them (see Mr. Grombie's minute of 24th January). 7e could ask him to advise on the probable reactions of the Afghan Govt, and on the question whether we should inform the Afghan Govt, that we have received an enquiry from the Germans about the India route as an alternative to that by Afghanistan and Central -sia, and that we have promised them that we would consider an application for transit facilities across India by the We could also ask for his views as to whether if usual routes^ %£ we give the Afghans this information, we should also inform them of the prooosed condition that the Germans give up the idea of even a terminal service to Afghanistani (Intld.) J.C. W(alton), 10.2.38.I agree with the point which Mr. Collier makes in his minute and which had not occurred to me. The India Office, however, seem determined to resist any action at Kabul, but put up the alternative suggestion that the British Attache at Berlin should approach the German Government orally. This is worth consideration, though I tend to think it would be best to wait for Herr Pisch's reply. P. E. Department. (Initld. ) J.T.H. 31/1. C. Department. See minute below. (Sgd. ) A.S. HALFORD. 28th Jan. In all the circumstances, I agree that we can await Herr Pisch*s reply. (Initld. ) L. C. Jan 28th. I confess that I share the fear expressed by Mr. Collier in his minute of the 17th January. According to the record in N. 5292/1292/97(1937 ) of his conversation with General Milch on the 18th October, Lord Swinton referred solely to the proposed German service across Afghanistan to Sinkiang, and it was as an alternative to this through route that he suggested the route across India. Admittedly Lord Swinton referred to the danger of the Russians asking for facilities similar to those given to the Germans, but when he did so he expressly spoke, according to this record, of the route through Afghanistan. I therefore hardly think that it is necessarily true to state, as Mr. Walton does in his minute on the 4th November on N. 5292/N.5292, that 'the Germans will, of course, from the 'tenor of the conversation, understand that the 'Indian route is an alternative and conditional on 'their giving up the idea of a service through or in 'Afghanistan'. The question of a route ending at Kabul does net appear to have been mentioned, and as we have expressed no objection to such a route, I feel pretty certain from what I know of the Germans that they will assume that we have no objection. In fact, from what we have told them, they would appear to be quite justified in so doing. That being so, it seems that if we allow them to go on believing that our only objection is to a through route, they will consider that we have acted in bad faith if, when they come to ask for facilities across India, we suddenly tell them that our objections also apply to a route ending at Kabul. This, I am afraid, is just the sort of treatment which enemies of this country in Germany believe is typical of us, and with which they would undoubtedly make play. ) I therefore submit that we should strongly urge tne India Office to make the position clear to the Germans without further delay. This could, I should have thought, be done direct with Milch or Fisch in Berlin through the Air Attache. (Sgd. ) I. MALLET. February 2nd, 1938. I think the India Office might be asked to reconsider the point in the light of Mr. Mallet's minute, with which I agree. (I apologise for delay) /o ^ x ^ ; (Sgd. ) W. srftANG. 5/2.I hope the India Office will now agree, in principle, to our saying something to the Germans on this point without further delay. As to where and how we should say it, I am open to conviction, though I still think Kabul the best place. (Initld.) L. G.

On the whole I think it would still be best zo wait for the official German application before approaching them on this point. We shall have to consider carefully the best method of making this communication tothe German Government, in view of possible Afghan ana Soviet reactions. An oral comrnunication to the German Government through the British Attache m Berlin would, perhaps he the best means of approach. The position vis-a-vis the Afghan Government may he rather delicate, since on general grounds the Afghans might he quite glad^to^have a German air service to Kabul. If we are to take/steps with a view to preventing it, it will he for consideration whether we should not inform the Afghans in some way of what we are doing. If the Af^ans shouid unfortunately decide that they agree to a German service to Kabul and risk Soviet reactions, it would I feel, he difficult for us to press our objections very far. .fay CXyLt\S/&gt; /I ^7 - 'xciw a tfu / ^ ru / ^ c&lt;uaj- w M.J' 4xkA ° ' I ^ [ A* k * Jit- If 4a- A A j fa if Us l (^.lA m 1 ^ 1 % ^ y.M I N U T K S. ^iaa 'S'llSO Kabul 'k ill J to ,s icatiou life 5 |t W^ ul^ o COPY . 168/58/97).

But we must expect the Germans to follow up both possibilities for their route to China until the last minute, before they decide one way or another. F.E. Dept. C. Dept. (Signed) A.S. HALFORD. 15th Jan.1958. ; I have talked with Mr. Crombie India Office about the desirability of instructing Colonel Fraser-Tytler to take action in Kabul on this. On N 5521/1292/97, Colonel Fraser-Tytler was in formed that the Germans were being offered facilities through India and was given discretion to warn the I j Afghan Government against a German terminal service to Kabul. x In conversations here, General Milch was given to understand that an offer of facilities through India was conditional on the Germans abandoning the Sinkiang project (see N 5292/1292/97). I think we may safely assume that Colonel Fraser- Tytler has seized every opportunity to make this point clear to all whom it may concern at Kabul, and it there fore seems unnecessary to instruct him to take any further action. When the Germans do officially approach us with , ;f a request for facilities across India, we can put our ^ conditions on record, and this method should be much more effective in the end. We cannot, in any case, do any more.., |more to stop the Gennans going through Afghanistan than we are doing at present. We might score a small tactical success now, by instructing Colonel Fraser-Tytler to head off the Germans in Kabul, but no amount of tactical successes are any use, if the strategy is wrong. The (Signed) A.S. HALFORD. 15th Jan.1958. point which troubles me in this matter is rather different from that discussed above. We have told the I Germans that our offer of facilities through India was conditional on their abandoning the through service via sinkiang; but as far as I can see we have not told them that it was also conditional on their abandoning the plan for a service terminating at Kabul, and I fear that if we do not take some further step now to make our position quite clear the Germans may establish their Kabul service and then claim that we are still committed to per mitting them to run a service to China via India. It seems to me that the German Minister’s present statement gives Colonel Fraser-Tytler a good opportunity for asking him whether he knows about the negotiations for the route through India, and adding in that connexion that he presumes it is realized that our caveat about the Sinkiang project applied also to a terminal service to Kabul. Otherwise we may be put in a false position , and even render ourselves liable to a charge of bad faith - which, to judge from our experience of their methods in other matters, the Germans would not hesitate to make if, as now seems probable, they are determined to push the Kabul project through if they can, regard less of our interests.T&gt; The reply to this telegram could also contain a reference to N 21d/58/97 - as to which I agree with Mr. (V Halford that we are adequately safeguarded against the ^ ) German attempt to use a route via Kandahar.

Johnston 14.12.37• This is a matter of considerable importance. It is very desirable on strategic and political grounds to divert the Germans from their projected route to the Far East via Afghanistan and Central Asia, and for this reason, after obtaining the concurrence of the Govts, of India and Burma, we have encouraged the Germans to apply for transit facilities across those coontries. The ! Warren Fisher Committee, moreover, has endorsed the view of the Air Ministry that it is undesirable to use our Empire geographical position to refuse landing rights to foreign concerns. In addition, if the Germans settle down to a route across India and Burma, it will be of advantage to us in the event of war or emergency that they should have become dependent on such facilities. Though the difficulties of the Central Asian route are very great, the Indo—Burma route is more roundabout for the Germans, and it is by no means sa^e to assume that they will decide on its adoption. Tne matter has therefore to be somewhat carefully handled, in order 1 to avoid, so far as possible, discouraging such a decision. It is clear, however, that if they use the Indian route, they will not be able to oDuain direct access to it from Kabul, and may find it difficult to do so from Tehran, and may have to adopt a more soutnerly route/ 063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 10P! 1 / * K J I ! 1, route via the Gulf. If they fly via the Gulf they should go by the northern shore and not by the Arab shore. I understand, after speaking to Sir P. Shelmerdine, that he agrees that it would be as well to explain these points at once about the approach to India. One can foresee that there may be a further difficulty with the Germans about the route from Burma to China. The proposed terminus of their projected Central Asian route was in N. China, and I presume that they will still be aiming at a terminus in N. China, or possibly Shanghai. For such a terminus the route followed by Imperial Airways (Rangoon-Bangkok - or Fitsanuloke-Hanoi- | Hongkong) would be very roundabout, and a route via the Shan States (if and when this materialises) might not be much better. So far as the Germans are concerned, they might possibly wish to take the risk of some more northerly, hitherto unexplored, route, e.g., Mandalay- Yunnan. If any such suggestion were advanced it would, of course, in any case necessitate consultation with the Govt. , m ■ p °f Burma, but there is also the question whether such a 1 1 IL short cut would be regarded as consistent with the principle I Jirl &lt; jij (which is of course part of the Air Ministry policy) of not ill giving facilities to a foreign concern which would enable . it to compete with advantage with Imperial Airways; the i '3 j |N| 1 I ; question whether this principle would be infringed would presumably depend partly on the German terminus, which would ai f ec t the question whether there was likely to be a.nj competition oetween such a service and Imperial Airways i: 1 I for the carriage of mails and passengers. Gol. Shelmerdine agrees, however, that we need l not say anything to the Germans at present about the route of departure from Burma, but can wait and see whether they maxe a specific enquiry on this point.linute Paper Department, I attach a somewhat revised draft, to which an addition has been made in the light of my conversation with Sir F.

My dear Shelmerdine, •iuh reiefence to your letter of the 8 th December about facilities for a German service to the Par East, v;e do not think it necessary to consulc tne -overaments of India and Durma as to the reply to be sent to Ministerialdirektor Pisch. Ue would suggest that you might inform him that transit facilities would oe considered for the German service by the route across India and Durma at present used by the French and Dutch air lines, namely, Karachi-Jodhpur-Allahabad-Calcutta-Akyab-liangoon, and that you might, as you suggest, add the information as to stage mileage. T 7e suggest, however, that it might also be desirable to give Herr Pisch such information as we can about the route of access t_q India. This might be useful to him, and may also avoid any risk of future misunderstanding. If you agree, perhaps some explanation on the following lines might be given to him. As he is no doubt aware, the north-west frontier of India and the frontier regions in Baluchistan, except on or near the coast, are a prohibited area; the method of approaching Karachi would therefore be along the coast from Gwadur; for access to Gwadur, unless the Germans find it practicable to fly there direct from Tehran, the route would be that followed by Air Prance and K.L.M. along the northern coast of the Persian Gulf; and would presumably be joined at some point either from Tehran, if that place forms part of the projected route, or from Baghdad. it/ Lieutenant Goponel Sir P.

Dear Sir Francis, On his return from his visit to England- of which he spo.xe in entnusias cic 'Germs — the Secretary of State, General Milch, informed me that your ‘Minister spoke with him regarding communication between Germany and the Far East, and that reference v/as made to the route over .British India. In this conversation your Minister intimated that it was unlikely that any hesitation would arise in granting English approval to German aircraft flying over British India.

Air routes There are no officially defined air routes in India at present. The route normally followed however is what is known as the trans-India route which is - Karachi-Jodhpur-D e1hi-G awnpor e-Al1ahabad-0al cut ta- Akyab-Rangoon. This route is followed by the air mail service across India operated jointly by Imperial Airways and Indian Trans-Continental Airways.

Dear Sir Francis, On his return from his visit to England - of which he spoke in enthusiastic terms - the Secretary of State, general Milch, informed me that your Minister spoke with him regarding communication between Germany and the Far East, and that reference was made to the route over British India. In this conversation your Minister intimated that it was unlikely that any hesitation would arise in granting English approval to German aircraft flyin pursuing this Far Eastern goal for some considerable time; the last experimental flights they carried out were directed towards this end. Lufthansa are thus naturally keenly interested in being able to fly over British India. Before we make a move at this end with an official letter to your Minister, however, I should first of all like to ask your attitude as to what in your opinion is the most suitable arrangement of routes (spacing and situation of stages) in India.

Early in our conversation General Milch expressed his gratitude for the help which we had given to the German pilots who were stranded in Sinkiang. This gave me the opportunity of opening up the whole subject of the route. I said that we had been very glad to help, but that the Germans seemed to have selected a rather perilous route. It was a route which we should never dream of attempting to develop for civil aviation, and I explained our unwillingness to have the risk of machines coming down in Indian frontier territory, on the lines set out in the India Office memorandum. I said that we should treat this just as much as a prohibited area for our own people as for anyone else, for these reasons. I also told General Milch quite frankly that if the Germans were to establish a route through Afghanistan, the Afghan Government could not refuse access to the Russians, and I did not suppose that would be more agreeable to him than to us - a point v/hich he readily took. I also told him that our latest information was that the Russian protbgb was again in control in Sinkiang, so far as anyone controlled. He said that was also his information. General Milch then said that they had selected this route because it was very short. I quoted to him the proverb about the longest x j ound being the quickest way home. He said that he thought in the circumstances there might be a good deal of truth in this. I am glad to say he then took the opening of asking, was there a practical alternative? What about the route across India?

My Lord, With reference to the 7th to 9th paragraphs of the enclosure to my despatch No« -529 of the IQth~NovemberI have to inform Your Lordship that the Soviet Ambassador called at this department on the 3rd November to discuss, as he said, several matters of mutual interest, particularly the proposed German air service to China via Afghanistan, which he must say frankly his Government did not like^ at all* 2. M.Maisky was informed that, to be equally frank, His Majesty’s Government did not like this service either; but it was thought that for various reasons it was not in fact likely to materialise. His Excellency agreed that some of these reasons, such as the state of affairs in Chinese Turkistan (about which it was hinted that he might have more information than His Majesty’s Government) were fairly cogent; but the Germans were very persistent, and he believed that they had already secured permission from the Persian and Iraqi Governments for the route to pass over those countries, provided that the Afghan Government gave their consent to it. He was told that this was also our information but that, as far as was known here, the Afghan Government were not likely to consent to a service terminating at Kabul but only to the use of Kabul as a transit station on/ His Excellency The Viscount Chilston, G.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc. , Moscow.on the service to China, so that if that service proved impracticable Afghanistan would not be affected 0 3 0 Mdaisky then asked whether the matter had been discussed with General Milch when he was here; and, as he evidently suspected something it was thought best to tell him that there was some possibility of the Germans altering the whole scheme to one of a service to the Par East by the southern route via India etc., and that if they applied for facilities for such a service the Government of India might well think it worth while to grant them, on the understanding that this would definitely put an end to the whole Kabul project. 4, For your own information I enclose a copy of a record of the conversation between the Secretary of State for Air and General Milch on this subject, and of a telegram from His Majesty's Chargb d'Affaires at Kabul showing the latest developments there.

We cannot be quite certain that their application will materialise, nor can we be too sure that they might not attempt to obtain terminal facilities at Kabul by persuading the Afghans that these facilities are only intended to be temporary until the situation in China permits of the service being extended to the Far East. The question is whether we ought to warn the Afghans of this possibility, as suggested in para .5 of Major Macann*s telegram, or whether we can safely leave it to the Afghans themselves and to the Russians to counter any such move on the part of the Germans. There is a certain advantage in remaining in the background ourselves as far possible'. In this connection please see Mr. Collier s note of his conversation with the Soviet Ambassador of 5th November, at P.Z.7374/37* On the whole, however, I think it might be as well to give Major Macann discretion to warn the Afghans as he suggests.» A draft telegram to Kabul is suggested.

If this is true, it is all to the good. * It may be desirable to try to ascertain from the German authorities what the present position is in regard to the suggestion made by General Milch in his conversation with Lord Swinton on 18th October for using the Indian route instead of the Central Asian. It is for consideration whether we should not take tentative soundings — perhaps through the Air Attache at Berlin, since the matter is probably very much within the sphere of the German air authorities. I spoke to Squadron Leader Darvall the other day about this, and suggest that we might ask the Air Ministry whether they think it would be a good thing to take such soundings. Unless we learn soon how the matter stands, it may become difficult to decide exactly what line we ourselves should take at Kabul. 'P.Z.7374/37. Draft Paper. political Department.

But our objections to a service terminating at Kabul are even stronger than to a transit service. If all goes well the next move should be an approach to us by the Germans for facilities in India, and pressure on Afghanistan should then diminish. In these circum stances it is perhaps unnecessary for Major Macann to speak to the Afghan Government spontaneously on this question, but we should authorise him to continue to resist the German service if they raise the matter.

I agree; but I cannot help feeling that this aeroplane service, Germany - Japan via Kabul is part and parcel of the 'Anti-Communist' German/Japanese Pact, and that consequently (a) Germany will await the outcome of the Sino- Japanese conflict ere she commits herself to the India route (b) Japan will do all she can to help open up the China service if a victory over the latter should enable her to do so. We must I think therefore reckon with this eventuality and the marked passage X^ a ^ es 1116 feel that the Afghans are weakening. (Signed) R.H. Hadow. 9/11. I agree generally with the above minutes. What I am afraid of now is that the Germans, seeingthat the service to China is not likely to be a practicable proposition for a long time to come, will avoid, or at least delay, making any application to us for the use of the Indian route, but will concentrate on getting permission from the Afghans for a service to Kabul only. (The fact that such a service would not be likely to pay would not necessarily deter them from starting it, as it would have a considerable nuisance value as against both us and the Russians and might ultimately be absorbed in a service to the Far East when conditions became favourable for that). If therefore we do not hear anything from the Germans about the Indian route in the very near future, ij ih I think it is desirable that Major Macann should speak to the Afghan Government as he suggests. Otherwise the Germans may get permission for a terminal service out of the Afghans, while we do nothing to stop them under the belief that they are going to apply for permission to use the Indian route for the Far Eastern service. They could not complain if they found out that we were doing this, since we have already made it plain to them that we do not want a German service either to or through Kabul. (Signed) L.

Note of a Conversation between the Secretary of State for Air wnd General Milch, I I RECEIVED General Milch and his colleagues this morning. Early in our conversation General Milch expressed his gratitude for the help which we W’i p-iyen to the German pilots who were stranded m binkiang. This gave me tk oDnortunity of opening up the whole subject of the route I said that we had I been very glad to help, but that the Germans seemed to have selected a rather perilous route It was a route which we should never dream of attempting to develop for civil aviation, and I explained our unwillingness to have the risk of machines coming down in Indian frontier territory, on the lines set out in the India Office memorandum. I said that we should treat this just as much as a I I prohibited area for our own people as for anyone else, for these reasons. I also ! General Milch quite frankly that if the Germans were to establish a route through Afghanistan, the Afghan Government could not refuse access to the Russians and I did not suppose that would be more agreeable to him than tous- a point which he readily took. I also told him that our latest information was I that the Russian protege was again in control in Sinkiang, so far as anyone controlled. He said that was also his information General Milch then said that they had selected this route because it was very short I quoted to him the proverb about the longest way round being the quickest wav home. He said that he thought in the circumstances there might be a o-ood deal of truth in this. I am glad to say he then took the opening of asking, ! was there a practical alternative? What about the route across India? I said that we should be quite ready to consider this favourably if they put it up as an alternative. General Milch expressed his gratitude, and said they would do so. j October 18, 1937.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF 299th C.I.D. HELD ON 14th OCTOBER 1937. MEETING (3) CIVIL AVIATION: GERMAN PENETRATION IN THE FAR EAST. (C.I.D. Paper N0.1356-B) (Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 294th Meeting, Minute 11. THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on German Penetration in the Far East in connection with Civil Aviation. (C.I.D. Paper N0.1356-B). LQtjj ZaTLaND said that the Government of India were very anxious to discourage the Germans from developing their civil aviation route to the Far East on the lines they were at present pursuing, namely, through Afghanistan. It was true that they had already started, but recently they had had a setback when one of their machine had been lost for a month and the occupants held captive. This incident had caused the Government of India a lot of trouble in providing assistance for its search. It T,T as clear that, if Germany insisted on continuing to use the Afghan route, similar situation w ould inevitably arise. There T ”ould be crashes and the infringement of prohibited areas, -hich the Government of India ^oula find undesirable and inconvenient. He therefore felt that the best solution w as to persuade the Germans to use the facilities already existing on our o m n air route to the Far East and that the moment seemed to be a suitable one in which to persuade the Germans to ask for these facilities. LORD STINTON, referring to the proposed discussions between himself and General Milch, said that he t,t ouLi endeavour to persuade General Milch to ask for transit facilities across India. There w ere t T * T o points, however, about T,T hich he T,T ould like the guidance oi the Committee.Firstly, if General Milch did not volunteer the request for these facilities, he felt that he (the Secretary of State for ^ir) should offer them. The second point ^as in connection T 'ith the German view that our objections route to their use of the Afghanistan/^ere due to our anxiety that the Russians would shortly follow. He (Lord 3-inton) suggested that it would be as well for him to allo r,T this impression to remain. CONCLUSIONS. THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed: (a) To take note of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for ^ir on German Penetration in the Far Last, with regard to Civil Aviation (C.I.D.Paper No.1356-3) (b) To concur in the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Air that, in his conversations with General Milch, he should take the following line:- (i) that, if possible, General Milch should be induced to volunteer a request for transit facilities for German aircraft across India. (ii) that, failing such a request, Lord Sainton should himself offer these facilities. (iii) that General Milch should be allowed to believe that our objection to the German use of the route through Afghanistan was due to our anxiety that the Russians would inevitably demand similar facilities, which it would be very difficult for the Afghan Government to refuse, if they had acceded to the German request.! * THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air. AT their 294th Meeting held on the 17th June, 1937, the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed— (i) To approve the principle that we ought to try and stop the development of a foreign air route if it would adversely affect some important strategic interest. (ii) That, since it is a strategic interest to keep both Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities to either the Germans or the Russians. (iii) That the proposal of the Secretary of State for India (Paper No. 1333-B, # paragraph 9 (a )), that facilities on the route Persia- Karachi-Delhi should be offered (subject to the consent of the Government of India) to the Germans, should be referred to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications, for consideration and report. The question of the grant of facilities on the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi to a German company was accordingly referred to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications and the following extract from the minutes of the Committee contains the Committee’s recommendation :— “ The Committee noted from Paper I.A.C. 365 that the Governments of India and Burma had no objection to an offer being made to the Germans of transit facilities for a German service across India and Burma by the existing route, but that the Government of India doubted if the offer would ( be accepted ‘ in view of the considerable diplomatic and technical success that the Germans have already achieved, and the fact that they must already know it is virtually impossible for us to refuse these facilities.’ It was explained to the Committee that this doubt of the Government of India had been expressed in the light of the two recent successful experimental flights from Kabul to Kansuh and before the recent incident. On its return flight from Ansifu, a Lufthansa machine, with Herr Von Gablenz, Managing Director of the Deutsche Lufthansa, on board, had been forced to land near Khotan (Chinese Turkistan), where passengers and crew had been held captive for a month until a permit had been granted for the flight to be resumed. In the meantime, search arrangements had been organised by the Germans with the help of the Government of India. “ It was suggested to the Committee that the moment might be opportune to approach the Germans. The physical and political difficulties of the route [15971]mwm from Kabul, which traverses a sphere of Soviet influence, could be stressed and the fact that occasional incidents of this sort with requests for our assistance would be inevitable. It could be pointed out that violations of the prohibited area on the north-west frontier would in these circumstances ■ probably re-occur. . . “ The Committee were informed that a mission ot the German Air Force.' headed by General Milch would be visiting this country next month. The n fVmf ftne visit would afford an ouuortimitv nf m+Ov,™ ii. the neaaea oy uentna-i ' : , P p : mumn. j Committee thought that this visit would afford an opportunity of letting Germans know that if they asked for facilities across India and Burma by the normal route, we would be ready to offei them. It was considered preferable that the Germans should, if possible, be induced to make the request rather than that we should make an offer. It was suggested that this could be done by the Secretary of State for Air or Sir Francis Shelmerdine I in conversation with Herr Milch. It would, however, have to be made clear j that our offer would be conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul route. t£ The Committee considered that it would be desirable for the Air Ministry, India Office and Foreign Office to prepare, in consultation, a memorandum for guidance in connection with the suggested conversation with General Milch on this matter.” I am in agreement with the recommendation of the Committee and, with my colleagues’ concurrence, I should propose, if a suitable opportunity arises, to discuss the matter with General Milch next week on the lines suggested. S. Air Ministry, October 12, 1937.MEMORANDUT. Suggested material for a conversation with General Milch. The conversation might perhaps be opened by a reference to the interest with which we have followed the progress made by the Lufthansa Company with the project of a service to the Far East. It might then not be amiss to express some admiration for the enterprise shown by the aviators, including, it is understood, Herr von Gablenz, who undertook the difficult experimental flights from Kabul across the Pamirs and deserts of Central Asia to Kansu in one hop, and congratulations on the success of the first two outward experimental flights. On the other hand, it could be continued, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the two experimental aircraft were not able to complete the return journey with the same success; we were delighted to hear of the safe return to Kabul of the lost aeroplane with von Gablenz and its crew on 27th September, after four weeks' captivity in the neighbourhood of Khotan. We were very glad to do what was possible in endeavouring to assist the search aircraft operating from Kabul by instituting enquiries through our local representatives in Sinkiang and elsewhere, and by giving such facilities as we were able (see attached note). 2. It might then be stated that we fully appreciate and. sympathise with the German desire to establish a commercial air route to the Far East which we consider to oe perfectly legitimate and natural and have no desire to hinder in any way. It would seem, however, that the experience now gained more than confirms the anticipations which may naturally have been entertained, in trie absence ofany possibility of using Russian territory, as to the inherent difficulties of this particular route across Central Asia, passing as it does through the narrow Wakhan corridor, over the Pamirs and across the deserts of Sinkiang. Apart from the physical difficulties, there are, as has just beoi illustrated, other difficulties resulting from the disturbed political conditions in Sinkiang, of which His Majesty’s Government have had unfortunate experience for many years, and which appear to be almost endemic; as a result largely of these disturbed conditions, Chinese authority is intermittent and the connection with the Central Government at Nenking (even when the latter is not preoccupied as at present) is hardly more then nominal. The Soviet Government have been able to acquire a considerable degree of political ascendancy over the Provincial authorities. For some time past a Tungan and Turki rebellion has been in progress in Southern Sinkiang against the Provincial Government, but the rebels have recently suffered reverses, and the latest news is that the Provincial Government are now again in control as far as Khotan. 3. Apart from these general considerations, which indicate the enormous difficulties, physical and political, of the Central Asian route, it might perhaps be frankly stated that the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government would view with some misgiving an attempt to operate this route from the point of view of their own local interests in that part of the world. One most important consideration is that a route passing through a narrow corridor between Russian and Indian territory almost inevitably involves risks of flying over Indian territory in bad weather, if Russian territory is to be avoided. This part/part of Indian territory is a prohibited area, and one of the main reasons why it has been prohibited is precisely the inaccessible and inhospitable nature of the country, which is not everywhere fully administered, and the backward character of some of its inhabitants - factors which make it extremely difficult to organise the search for, and rescue of, an aircraft in the event of a forced landing, or to provide for the safety of its passengers and crew. It is clear, however, that there is a grave risk not only of aircraft, which attempted to use the proposed route, crossing Indian territory but also of a relatively high frequency of accidents, in which case it would naturally be incumbent on the Indian authorities to do what they could, despite the great difficulties, to organise searches and rescues. The use of the route would consequently involve the Government of India in anxieties and responsibilities which they would naturally desire to avoid. 4. Perhaps, if we are prepared to be completely frank with General Milch, it might also be stated that we have another reason - which would appeal to the Germans - for viewing with some apprehension the establishment of an international air route through Afghanistan, namely, that, as the Germans are doubtless aware, the Russians have for many years been pressing the Afghan Government for a permanent agreement for a service in Afghanistan (to replace the precarious and irregular facilities which they at present enjoy); the Afghan Government who have no love for the Soviets, have hitherto, we are glad to say, resisted this pressure; but oixsea German or other international service were established through that country, it would seem impossible for the Afghan Government to deny to Russia what they had accorded to Germany; this would be a development which/which we should be very sorry to see materialise, as the Russians on account of their geographical and other advantages would probably secure the lion’s share of the traffic, so far as Afghanistan was concerned, and the result would be a great access to the economic and political influence of the Soviet Government in that country. 5. le might then sound General Milch as to his information regarding the attitude of the German Government on the question of proceeding with the project of a service to the Far East by the Central Asian route. If it should appear that the Germans themselves are impressed by the difficulties of making a practical success of this route, it might be possible to elicit from them an enquiry as to the possibility of an alternative route vj.a India, which would equally well serve the German objective, viz .. the carrying of mails and passengers to China and Japan. If in the course of conversation no such enquiry or request is elicited, then we might volunteer a tentative offer (based on our policy of freely admitting the civil aviation of other Air Powers to the regular airports situated in our territory) to consider in principle affording facilities, in accordance with the usual practice for a year at a time, for the German service to the Far East by the normal route across India and Burma, subject, of course, to subsequent examination of all the details. It should be explained, if necessary, that it would be impossible to give facilities for a route from Kabul across India, on account of the existence of the prohibited area (through which the Government of India are not at present prepared to open a corridor); but in principle the normal route via Karachi could be considered. 6. It should also be intimated that we of course understand that if a mutual agreement were reached for the utilisation/utilisation of the normal route across India, the Germans would no longer be interested in the Central Asian route, and would not desire to obtain facilities, either transit or terminal, at Kabul, and that our offer is made on this understanding.Note on recent experimental flights by German aircraft across Smkiang in connection with projected German service to the Far East. Two experimental flights by Lufthansa aeroplanes were successfully made last August from Kabul to An-si-fu in Kansu, but the first machine to attempt the return flight with Herr von Gablenz on board had to make a forced landing on 30th August near Khotan, in Southern Sinkiang, and was not heard of again till 27th September, when it arrived at Kabul, the crew having during the interval been detained under arrest by the Tungans, who are rebels against Chinese authority in Sinkiang and are in control at Khotan. The second machine appears to have met with an accident, or otherwise to have become damaged, in China. The Germans sent an air expedition of three aircraft to Kabul to search for the missing machine, and made a number of requests to the Government of India for facilities and assistance in the search, many of which were granted. Thus - (a) A supply of petrol was sent to Kabul for the use of the rescue aircraft. (b) The Consul-General at Kashgar and the Government of India’s representatives in Chitral, Kashmir, Gilgit and. at Lhasa were asked to institute enquiries regarding the missing aeroplane. The Consul-General at Kashgar was also asked toofier any assistance he could to the local authorities. As a result of the Consul-General’s action ohe ^ Administrative Commissioner at Kashgar instructed all the authorities under him to make enquiries, and also informed Urumchi. (c) Later on, the Germans asked permission for the rescue aircraft to use the Gilgit landing grouna. The German narty at Kabul subsequently explained that they only wished to use it for landing in case of emergency, and the Government of India, agreed to this in the event oi real emergency. (d) The Government of India agreed to the German party at Kabul establishing direct wireless contact with the Consul-General at Kashgar. i (e) The German Minister at Kabul asked that in case of emergency, including bad weather, the German aircraft/aircraft might use a route passing through Chitral, in Indian territory, and the Government of India replied that, while they were unwilling to grant formal permission, they would not object if that territory had to be crossed in emergency. The Indian frontier had been crossed by one of the search aircraft on a reconnaissance flight on 13th September - a. violation which was condoned by the Government of India. When the lost aeroplane arrived at Kabul the German Minister there expressed great appreciation of the assistance afforded by the Government of India in the search.-V _ gll 14th October,1937 My dear Walton, . Ihank you for your letter of the 6th instant with which you sent me a draft of a memorandum of material for a conversa tion with General Milch, together with other documents. We have no observations to make on the draft memorandum. Lord Swinton has seen it and will himself deal with General Milch. Yours sincerely, 'Zxc/n*. cv J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B. ,M.C.

Sir oince the draft rcemor&amp;n^ma enclosed 'ith my letter of 6 th October wag drafted, we have son»e later news from Oinkiang, where the situation is liable to rapid change. I enclose a telegram of 6 th October, from ^hicn you will see that the Provincial Government at Urumchi, which recently recovered Kashgar from the Tungan forces, has now been able to resume control of Oouthern oinkiang as far as holan (the place near which von Gablenz and his crew were recently detained by he Tungans, who were then in control there's. Ihe effect of the collapse of the rebellion is, on the one hand, that for the time being (it may not last long} there is a condition of relative peace instead of civil war in the area between Kashgar and Khotan, and, on the otuer, that the Provincial Government, which is, to a large extent at any rate, under the influence of the Soviet Government, is now in control of this area. Colonel F,C. Shelmerdine, O.3.E. In/In order that the facts in the memorandum for Lord Swinton may be up to date, couli you kindly i&amp;ve the following substituted for the last 12 lines of loere^raph 2 of the draft memorandum? . hardly more than nominal. The Soviet Government have been able to acquire a considerable degree of political ascendancy over the Provincial authorities. For some time past a Tung&amp;n and Turki rebellion has been in progress in 'Southern .inkian, ; against the Provincial Government, but the rebels have recently suffered reverses, and the latest news is that the Provincial Government are now again in control es far as Khotan.' The Foreign Office have no observations on the draft, except that they suggest that at the end of it something should be said about the concession of facilities in India being for a year at a tine (so that it could be withdrawn if the Germans revived the Central is-sian plan). I think that Collier consulted Burkett on this point. I imagine that it is implie in any offer of facilities th&amp;l they are automatically terminable, but we see no objection to the point being , brought/brought out. Perhaps in the sixth line on page 5 of the draft, after the words f&lt; to consider in principle affording facilities', the words &lt;c in accordance with the usual practice for a year at a time' should be inserted. As regards the Persian link, if the Germans have difficulty in arranging a more direct route from Tehran to Karachi they would presumably follow the French and Hitch route along the Persian shore of the Gulf. We agree with the Air Ministry view that they should not be allowed to think that they could obtain authorisations from the rulers on the Arab shore. (Sgd.) J.G. Walton.1 *please see my minute. (Intd.) L.C. The draft memorandum follo?/s the lines of the decisions at the International Air Communications Committee meetings (Sir G. Mounsey's minute on N 5711/1292/97 and Mr. Howard Smith's minute in N 4894/1292/97). The only points on which we can comment are (1) the fact that we are apparently not to ask for any quid pro quo for facilities in India, unless the 'understanding” suggested in the last paragraph of the memorandum may be considered in this light. It may be that we want nothing from the Germans as far as civil aviation is concerned, but it might be as well to establish this before making them on an unconditional offer. The 'understanding” that the Germans would no longer try for a service to Kabul would be difficult to formulate. If informal it might not be of much value*.- if formal it would give great offence to the Afghans if it became known to them without their being u parties to it; and although they dislike the German service they might well hesitate to renounce their chance of it for good. (ii) Mr. Walton enquires of Sir F. Shelmerdine v/hether he thinks the Committee of Imperial Defence should be consulted again before the offer is made to the Germans. Their last conclusions on this subject are in N 3475/G- As they asked for a report on this question and have not yet pronounced on it again it seems that their view should be taken. I understand that Mr. Burkett, Air Ministry, agrees ’ with the draft memorandum with the addition of a passage making it plain that we could not give facilities on Mr.Burkett that we agree to this (Intd.)

Mr. Howard Smith (first) Central Department (after action) (Sgd.) B.A.B.BURROWS 11 . 10 . I certainly think the Committee of Imperial Defence ought to be consulted before anything is said to the Germans. As regards the second paragraph of Mr. Burrows* minute, it is difficult to see what quid pro quo we could require of the Germans in this case except the abandonment of the route through Central Asia; nor do I see why it should be difficult to formulate an understanding to that effect. It would, of course, be informal, as the whole conversation is to be informal; but I can see no objection to saying to the Germans: It must be obvious, from what we have just said about our dislike of the Central Asian route, that we only give you facilities through India if that route is abandoned in favour of the Indian route. If you revive the Central Asian idea, it goes without saying that we 'shall withdraw the facilities through India. '• (I have written this on the assumption that we should not give any facilities for an unlimited perioa. I cannot imagine that we should be so foolish as to give any rights which we could not withdraw after giving reasonable notice; V as the Air Ministry are 30 free and easy in these -tars, it might be as well to make sure of this in any This is so.

C.H.S. i 12 AO I have now spoken to Mr. Burkett, who agrees that something should be said at the end of the memorandum about the concession being for a year at a time, so that it could be withdrawn if the Germans revived the Central Asian plan. As regards consulting the C.I.D., Mr. Burkett thought that it could technically be argued that, when the C.I.D. referred the matter to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications, they washed their hands of the whole matter, since the Committee normally reported only to the Secretary of State for Air. He realised, however, that the C.I.D. might be surprised if they heard nothing more of the case; and he would bring the point to Lord Swinton's notice. I said that, so long as it was understood that the Secretary of State for Air took the responsibility for deciding whether or not to communicate again with the C.I.D., I did not suppose that the F.O. would wish to urge/WHKK&amp;B urge any particular course of procedure upon him. All they wanted to do was to put on record their own view that the C.I.D. seemed entitled to he consulted, or at least informed, before anything was said to the G-ermans.

As regards this service (the Kabul-China service;, a Herr Schuler, v;ho v/as on aircraft business here at the time of Schacht’s visit, representing the German approximation to our Department of Overseas Trade, is now again in Tehran. He has confirmed that nine trial flights were sanctioned, but says that negotiations have now broken down because the Iranian Government have declined to offer other or better terms for the proposed German Service than they offered to Imperial Airways in the past. Schuler said also that one Government’s consent to the service was outstanding beside the Iranian but seemed to think that this other one - name not given - could be obtained at a pinch.i^bobbob This is very interesting as being the first f ^ __ i indication that the German negotiations may^&amp;eh%LAdiixx ✓ elsewhere than in Kabul. If the Germans cannot obtain facilities in Persia the possibility of a service via India as well as via Afghanistan is excluded (even the A.M. do not want to let the Germans fly down the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf). It is to be feared that the Germans will use our offer of facilities in India to overcome their difficulties in Persia. There seems to be nothing we can do beyond our despatch in N 5292/1292/97 to Tehran. S. Dept, confirm that this is the latest information about the service from Tehran. ?

It will be remembered that the C.I.D. on 17th June last referred to the Warren Fisher Committee for consideration and report the proposal in the S. of S.'s memo, that facilities via India should, if the G. of I. agreed, be offered to the Germans, in the hope of diverting them from the Afghan route. The Warren Fisher Committee gave preliminary consideration /Am/? to the question at its meeting on 21st July, and agreed provisionally that, subject to further consideration when the views of the Govts, of India and Burma were received, transit facilities for a service via Karachi and Delhi might be offered. The Committee’s provisional views were communicated to the two Govts, concerned in our telegram of 4th August. The Govt, of Burma (telegram of 18th August) see no reason to object and the G. of I. (telegram of 6 th September and letter of 22nd September' have no objection, though they doubt whether the offer has any chance of acceptance, in view of the considerable success which the Germans have already achieved in negotiating for, and prospecting, the Central Asian route and the fact that (as the G. of I. suppose) they must already know that it is virtually impossible for us to refuse facilities via India. The question was considered further by the Warren Fisher Committee on 29th September in the light of the telegrams from Burma and India and of the recent history of the experimental flights across Sinkiang, in the course of which the one machine which performed the return flight was missing for four weeks near/ »i\near Khotan. The view of the Northern Dept, of the F.O. was, I understand, that the Germans were likely to be so depressed by what has happened to the experimental flights that they might give up the project without the necessity of our having to offer alternative facilities via India at all (i.e., the exact opposite of the G. of I.’s estimate of their probable attitude). This view, however, was not accepted by the F.O. representative on the Committee who, on the Chairman indicating that he thought the offer ought to be made, concurred in this proposal. I suggested that if the offer is to be made, the present seemed to provide a good psychological opportunity, as we could point to the difficulties experienced on the Central Asian route, in which the Germans had to ask for assistance (which was granted) from the G. of I., and the fact that the use of the route is consequently likely to involve us also in difficulties and anxieties. Sir Donald Banks strongly supports the proposal to offer the Indian facilities to t ! the Germans, mainly on the general ground of our policy ! of freely admitting the commercial air services of other Powers to our airports. The conclusion of the Committee was that we should either try to elicit a request from the Germans or, if necessary, make an offer, and, on the suggestion of Sir D. Banks, which the Chairman approved, that this might be done orally and informally in conversation with General I Milch, who will be visiting this country with a German Air Force mission this month. It was left to the 1.0., Air Ministry and F.O. to prepare in collaboration a memo, for use in the proposed conversati on, &gt;iinute Paper. Department. It is submitted that the proposal of the Committee may be approved. The proposed method of informal approach in the first instance has its advantages, but the memo, which is to serve as a brief for this purpose will need careful preparation. I am not sure that the F.O. and Air Ministry will see very closely eye to eye as to what should be said. As a first step I have sent a tentative draft memo., with the letter below, to Sir F.

It may well turn out that this view is correct; but that is not a reason for refraining from ascertaining whether the Germans would welcome or accept facilities vis India as an alternative to their present project. Moreover, the difficulties which tney have experienced with their experimental flights (despite the ultimate recovery of von Gablenz’s machine) and the facta that they had to turn to us for assistance, and have expressed gratitude for the help given, at any rate provide a good opportunity for soundiny them on the subject. 4./4. r n fcoonectton. with the question what should he said to General Mich, I enclose for ease of reference, three extracts from the Intelligence Summaries of our Military Attache at Kabul, dated 23rd iragraph 3 of Nummary Ho, 30. ; July and 14 th and 20th August * 2 M * .33. ) Ho. 34. ; respectively, in which remarks made J ^ by the German Charge d’Affaires at &lt;abul are recorded.

The use of the rout© would consequently involve the Government of India in anxieties and responsioiiiti.es which they would naturally desire to avoid* 4. Perhaps, if we are prepared t© be completely frank with General Milch, it might aleo oe stated that we have anotl®er reason • which would Ui ieal to Germane for/for viewing with some apprehension the establishment of an interne tional air route through Afghanistan, ixa&amp;eXy, tnut^ su the Q^ruiaxw are doubtless ewnre the mmi^m have for jrears been pressing the Afghan Government for « permanent agree/.ient for a service in Afghanistan (to replace the preoar ion© and. irregular facilities which they at present enjoy)} the Afghan Government who have no love for the Soviets, have hitherto, we are glad to say, resisted this pressure} but once a German or other international service were established through that country, it would seem impossible for the Afghan Government to deny to Husaia whet they had accorded to Germany; this would be a development which we should be very sorry to ma materialise, ae the Hues lane on account of the^. geographical and other advantage® would probably secure til© lion’s share of the traffic, so far as Afghanistan was concerned, and the result would be a great access to the economic and political influence of the soviet Government in that country. 5. we might then sound General 1 ileh as to his information regarding the attitude of the German Government on the question of proceeding with the ^reject of a service to the War last by the Central Asian route. If it should appear that the Germans themselves are impressed by t he difficulties of making a practical success of this route, it might be possible to elicit from them an enquiry ae to the possibility of an alternative route via India, which would equally well serve the German objective, via ., the carrying of m ils* t k i * * ‘ (fa) 5. &gt; and paseec^era to OMm and Japan • it in tM cours© of ccnTersaticn iio suoii enquiry or request is elicited, then we migiat volunteer a tentative offer ( based on cur policy of freely admitting the civil aviation of otmr u &lt;t ^ f l*- ^ r a * Air . owers to the regular Air sorts situateo in our to ooiaoider is&lt; , rincisle afford! aa facilitioij^ /for the Qe-nmn service to the Far East by the normal route across India fiiid Buraia, subject, of course, to aufesequent axasiination of all the details* it should be explained, if necessary, that it would be iapoeeiole to give facilities for a route from Iteul across India, on account of the existeiioe oX the prohibited area (through which the Government of India are not at present procured to open a corridor j; but in principle the s&amp;oroal route v~&amp; Kur.iChi could be oonaidered. d* It should also be iatli&amp;ated that w© of course understand tnat if a mutual agreement were reached lor the utilisation of the normal route across Xn&amp;ia f the farm*** would no longer be interested in the Central usi&amp;n route, anu would not desire to obtain facilities, either transit or terminal# at Kaoul, and that our offer is tuade ou this under©tan -ing•Hot© on recent ex &gt;eri sentai flti htc by German rircrrift across rinktang in connection frith projected Ger mn service to the Pi r r et.

In their opinion, the objective of the Germans being what it is, they would only diverge from the direct route from Tehran to China via Kabul in the last resort, and it is also to be considered whether the Iranian Government would allow a service which traversed Iran from Tehran to Karachi. 2. It seems unlikely that Geimany w ill ask for facilities for an air service terminating at Karachi or elsewhere in India. The Government of India do not wish feat she should he offered facilities for such a service, and should she ask for them they would like to be consulted further.

Affaires in para graph 6 of his despatch N o,88, dated the 14th August 1937, regarding the objections which exist to the loan of experts to the Afghan Government to assist them in start ing the required ground organisation in their country. They also think the Afghan Government might well resent the offer of such assistance as undue interference on our part. No useful purpose will, it is considered, be served by offering the Afghans either free training for their ground staff in India or financial with or without technical assistance. 4. With regard to the general question of the proposed German air service to or through Afghanistan, the Government of India are inclined to think that it will be more politic to avoid opposing the scheme in Kabul. As we have no alternative scheme to offer ourselves, the Afghans may well suspect us of designs to retard their progress and to keep them too much under our influence, and will almost certainly inform the Germans of our attitude. The Russians in any case are likely to oppose the scheme to the best of their ability, and we may leave it to them to incur the odium of loll owing this course . 5.

The Committee noted from Paper I.A.C.365 that the Governments of India and Burma had no objection to an offer being made to the Germans of transit facilities for a German service across India and Burma by the existing route, but that the Government of India doubted if the offer would be accepted ”in view of the considerable diplomatic/diplomatic aiiG. tcclinical success that the Germans have already' achieved and the fact that they must already know it is virtually impossible for us to refuse these facilities.” It was explained to the Committee that this doubt of the Government of India had been expressed in the light of the two recent successful experimental flights from Kabul to Kansuh and before the recent incident. On its return flight from Ansifu a Lufthansa machine with Herr Yon Gablenz, Managing Director of the Deutsche Lufthansa, on board had been forced to land near Khotan (Chinese Turkistan) where passengers and crew had been held captive for a month until a permit had been granted for the flight to be resumed. In the meantime search arrangements had been organised by the Germans with the help of the Government of India. It was suggested to the Committee that the moment might be opportune to approach the Germans. The physical and political difficulties of the route from Kabul, which traverses a sphere of Soviet influence, could be stressed and the fact that occasional incidents of this sort with requests for our assistance would be inevitable. It could be pointed out that violations of the prohibited area on the north west frontier would in these circumstances probably re-occur. The Committee were informed that a mission of the German Air Force headed by General Milch would be visiting this country next month. The Committee thought that this visit would afford an opportunity of letting the Germans know that if they asked for facilities across India and Burma by the normal route, we would be ready to offer them. It was considered preferable that the Germans should, if possible, be induced to make the request rather than that we should make an offer. It was suggested that this could be done by the Secretary/3. Secretary of State for Air or Sir Francis Shelmerdine in conversation with Herr Milch. It would, however, have to hej made clear that our offer would be conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul route. The Committee considered that it would be desirable for the Air Ministry, India Office,and Foreign Office to prepare, inconsultation, a memorandum for guidance in connectior with the suggested conversation with General Milch on this matterQa*' ‘J^CAat^C^ AFGHANISTAN. EXTRACT FROM INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NO. 39. FOR THE WEEK ENDING 24TH SEPTEMBER, 1937. 3. German Air Service to the Far East . Reference Summary No. 38, paragraph 3. (a) A third three engine Junker monoplane No.D-AOYO arrived in Kabul at 1450 hours on 21st September to assist in the search for the missing aircraft. This monoplane was due in Kabul on 18th September but owing to shortage of petrol made a forced landing near Ghizao in Hazarajat. On 20th September petrol was dropped by parachute by one of the two German aircraft in Kabul, and the monoplane took off from Ghizao for Kabul. The pilot missed Kabul and landed by mistake at Jalalabad. After spending the night there the monoplane left for Kabul on 21st September. (b) There are now three German aircraft in Kabul. Search flights with a view to finding the missing aircraft have been made towards Wakhan and the Pamirs as follows 17 th Sept. One aircraft left Kabul returned at 1815 hours. at 0530 hours and 18th Sept. One aircraft left Kabul returned at 1300 hours. at 0730 hours and 19 th Sept. One aircraft left Kabul returned about midday. at 0805 hours and 21st Sept. Two aircraft left Kabul returned at 1100 hours. at 0530 hours and 23rd Sept. One aircraft left Kabul returned at 1315 hours. at 0600 hours and (c) On 23rd September a member of the staff of the German Legation in Kabul stated (A) that he thought no further flights between Kabul and Chi* 151 would be made until a wireless station had been established in Wakhan, and an emergency/emergency landing ground constructed between Kabul and Anhsi-fu in Kansu. The two monoplanes used for the experimental flights to China were not suitable for the work as they had not sufficient ceiling. One of the three aircraft sent to search for the missing monoplane would return to Germany in a day or two. (d) Afghan military and civil officials have made rather uncomplimentary remarks regarding the efficiency of German aircraft and pilots during the week. These had particular reference to the forced landing in Hazarajat, and the pilot making the mistake of thinking that when he reached Jalalabad he had arrived at Kabul. X XX Foreign Affairs . 9. Afghan officials at Nazi Congress meeting in Germany . The 'Islah* of 18th September states that according to information supplied by the German Legation in Kabul the following Afghan officials attended the Nazi Congress meeting held at Nurenburg recently - Abdul Majid Khan(WW-73) Managing Director of the Afghan National Bank, Abdur Rauf Khan and Muhammad Atiq Khan officials of the Afghan (WW-363) National Bank, and G.M. Muhammad Ihsan Khar/Commandant of the Afghan Air Force. G.M. Muhammad Ihsan Khan was given an interview by Herr Hitler who is said to have expressed his pleasure at the establishment of air communication between Germany and Kabul as this would be of advantage to both countries in the development of their cultural and economic interests.COPY (N 4061/1292/97) (96/3/37) British Legation, Sofia, August 27th, 1937.

The permission of the Chinese Government had been obtained for the flight. The second aircraft would remain in Kabul as a reserve in case any accident occurred to the first aircraft.

August that the Afghan Government had sanctioned nine trial flights over Afghan territory for the proposed German civil air service between Berlin, Kabul and the Far East. The Afghan Government would not however sanction a permanent service yet, and had stated that both the Russian and British Governments were opposed to the establishment of this service. He said that he could understand Russian objections to the service, also the proposed route led through the Wakhan which was a very narrow belt of Afghan territory and would inevitably lead to accusations of violating Russian territory. The British attitude he could not understand especially as Iraq had now sanctioned transit over their territory by aircraft of the proposed service, but he imagined that the British were afraid that the Russian Government would demand similar facilities for a civil air service in Afghanistan if the German service was estaolished.'v) c-o** ■ THE Under-Secretary of fetate fof.

Herr von Schweinitz the German Charge d*Affaires in Kabul stated (A) during the week that now that Iraq and Iran had sanctioned flights over their territory by the aircraft of the proposed service, they were anxious to carry out two or three test flights from Afghanistan to China. The Afghan Government had not yet sanctioned regular flights over their territory by the proposed service, but he still hoped to obtain their permission. The Russians were he knew very much opposed to the service, and would try to place every obstacle in the way of inaugurating such a service.

If, however, considerable expenditure on their part were m fact involved, the Afghan Government would presumahlv use dns ai gum ent to i el use the concession. It seems therefore unlikely that the question of financial assistance will arise. 4. Before turning to a consideration of the desirability of offering techni cal assistance, and the form which this might tale, I feel l'should give you the premisses from which I propose to discuss the matter. If these are incorrect caving to my limited knowledge of air matters, you will be in a position to make necessary adjustments. I am assuming that the main aerodrome which the Jiitt Hansa Company will use m this country will be that at Kabul and that Jan ding grounds will he required at Herat, Kandahar and Faizabad. Landing grounds exist at Herat and Kandahar and I suggest Faizabad, since the German meteorologists who took observations near the Anjuman Pass over the Hindu uusii last winter visited this place in the spring, and a possible inference is, that tney were prospecting for landing grounds. 5. Technical assistance to the Afghan Government could take at least two rms—tlie loan of experts to visit this country, or the training of Afghan per- sonuel m India. The former alternative is obviously preferable from the point 0 .,, vie )Y f t ;* 10 amount of British influence in air matters which it would carry wiln it, but is open to the following objections :— (G It involves, presumably, visits of reconnaissance and inspection by British subjects north of the Hindu Kush which I doubt whether the Soviet Government would view with equanimity, or without an attempt to obtain similar facilities south of that range. (ii) It would give the Soviet Government a double lever to move the Afghan Government to permit them to establish the Soviet air service for which they have tried so long.

As far as our information goes, they received permission from Iraq, but not from Iran and Afghanistan. It may be that they are conducting an experimental flight leading up to a service, but, as you know, we are anxious that they should be diverted from the Afghan route if possible and these developments therefore need very careful watching.

Sir, With reference to your telegram to Lieutenant- Colonel Fraser-fytler rfo.61 Secret of the 17th June,! have the honour to inform you that the Counsellor at this Legation took the opportunity of a talk with Captain Walker of ^essre Hawkers Limited to enquire what he believed to be the position with regard to the German air service through Iran. captain Walker replied that his impression was that German plans had advanced pretty far in Iran and Iraq, }, representative of the Lufthansa is now virtually attached to the German Legation here,and another German air expert from Kabul was in lehran last week. They told Captain Valker that they had found an exit not more than 9,000 feet high fx^om oorth T, ast Afghanistan,but that the lap from Kabul would have to be a very long one. Captain Y.olker expects another big German aeroplane here in a few weeks 1 time and thinks that the series of propaganda flights will continue until plans are still further advanced. His own aerodrome «-u Boshun T&amp;ppeh is a good natural all-weather one,which could easily be made a really good airport. Captain Walker believes that the German Legation derive satisfaction from their knowledge of this fact. 2.

It might be as well, therefore, to hint to the Germans the possibility of going through India, to induce the Afghans to be sticky, using the Soviet bogey, and to keep the Germans in play, delaying them where and when we can, until Imperial Airways is firmly established on the route which we are prepared to offer the Germans.

Ufo f ) A meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on , international air commonications was held at the Treasury on 21st July. Sir Donald Banks pointed out that the matter could not be thoroughly discussed until we know the views of the G. of I.; he also thought that the views of the Govt, of Burma should be obtained, m order that we may know whether we can offer the Germans not merely a terminal service to India but a transit service to China; the latter would be preferable to the former from our point of view, because there would be no raison d’ etre for a German service terminating in India except in competition with our own service. His own feeling was in favour of offering facilities, for the reasons given m the Cabinet by Lord Swinton and Sir S. Hoare against the adoption of an exclusive policy. The Committee agreed that, both on these general grounds and because of the strategic importance of diverting the Germans from Kabul, it would be desirable to be able to rake the offer of transit facilities in India and Burma. It was decided that it would be useful to let the Govts, of India and Burma know the sense of the nrelimmary views of the Committee, in order to expedite the consideration of the question. The possibility was recognised that, even if the Germans were given facilities in India and Burma, they might still a^k the Afghans for facilities for a service to Kaoul as a terminal service. But (apart from the possibility that tu.e^ might have less motive for pressing for the latter than would be the case if they required facilities at Kabul xor a transit service to China) it was thought that it might oe easier for the Afghan Govt, to continue their opposition to a service to Kabul if it were to be a terminal rather than a transit service, as the would not be open to the charge of blocking the latter. It/It has also to be remembered that, whereas the Afghan Govt, are at present opposing the.scheme because of their fear of Russian reactions, it is always possible that treirattitude may be modified by a natural desire to see ivabul a centre of internatlonal traffic* On the other hanc , re Afghans may perhaps have less motive for yielding to the Germans if it is a Question of a ^ranc/v (terminal) service i ati^er tha i oi a main (transit) service. Draft telegrams to the Govts, of India and Burma are submitted. Their issue would be subject to the concurrence of the S. of S. for Air, to whom the Committee reports; and the Secretary of the Committee has been consulted with a view to this being obtained.

It was recognised that even if transit facilities via India and Burma are granted, Germans may still ask Afghan Govt, for a terminal service to Kabul, but it was thought that it would be easier for latter to refuse this than a request for transit facilities. / .

The Committee had befca?e it a memorandum (l.A. C.352) calling attention to tiie reQuest o.l the Committee of Imperial Defence that the Question of offering the Germans facilities for an air service on the route Persia - Karachi - Delhi, should be examined. In ohis connection the text of a despatch which had been sent to the Government of India in order to ascertain their views was circulated at the meeting. The Committee felt that, pending the receipt of those views, and also those of Burma, the question could not usefully be explored in detail; but there was much to be said for making concessions to the Germans where this could be done without serious damage to our ccnimercial and strategic interests. In this case a concession would be likely to lessen the Geiman pressure on Afghanistan, while a generous air policy in the East might make it easier to keep the Germans off the direct ITorth Atlantic route. The danger of Germany linking up ?/ith the Par East and with Japan via Central Asia was shown by the reported recent formation of a Japanese International Airways Company, which had sent representatives to Germany to explore the possibility of a German-Japanese service. On the other hand it was thought that there would be decided disadvantages in allowing the Germans to make a terminal in India. Such a concession had not been granted to the French or Dutch who enjoyed transit facilities only. The Committee considered it preferable, therefore, that only transit facilities should be accorded to the Germans. It was by no means certain that this concession v/ould, in fact, induce them to abandon the idea of a service to Kabul, but it would in any case make it easier /for I J -i I'M 1* f I r I- 2 - for the Afghan Government to maintain their refusal of facilities for such a service. The Committee agreed provisionally that, subject to consideration in due course of the views of the GovemriBnt cf India and Burma, transit facilities for a German air service via Karachi and Delhi might be offered, and Hr. Walton promised to communicate this provisional view to these Governments. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxt~ ( 7 + P.Z. 42+77/37- ^ ^ (‘4 c 3$i) htbia oppice, WHITEHALL» S.W.L, 19th July, I 937 * SECKET AIR MAIL* / / / ■he I m directed by the Secretary of state for India to refer to the correspondence ending with Kabul telegram Wo.52 of l 5 th June regarding the proposed air 3erV ' iCe t0 Kabul ‘ This question has been under the careful examination of His Kaie'-tv'- nro majesty s Government. They consider it to be a strategic interest to Keep German as well as Russian air services out of Afghanistan and that the Afghan Government should be encouraged to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities to either Power. A copy is enclosed of a despatch which is being sent to His Majesty's ioter, ,.abul, regarding the attitude which he should a^opt towards the Afghan Government on the subject. _&gt; however, pOoSiole ohat the Afghan Government may ohe...ogives unaule go resist German pressure to grant l^nuing facilities, and the policy to be followed by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in that contingency requires consideration. 2. The Secretary of State would be glad of the views 0x tae Government of India on the suggestion that, if it appears likely that the Afghan Government cannot resist German pressure, an offer of facilities on the route .vc.ii.chi snould be made to the Germans, in the Hope that, as financial considerations cannot be entirely absent from their minds, this might divert their service altogether from Kabul. It would be for consideration whether/ (Wr’ etary t0 tile Government of India, SiSaf fairB De P ar traent,1W WHMM 4./ 2 * whether it would not he necessary, in order to furnish sufficient inducement to the Germans, to permit them to fly not only to Karachi hut also across India and Burma. Such an offer would strengthen the hand of the Afghan Government in refusing facilities in Afghanistan, as they would no longer he open to a charge of being an obstacle to a trans-Asian service. The Government of Burma could he consulted at a later stage regarding the grant of transit facilities to the German service in Burma and the route by which it might leave Burmese territory. In examining this suggestion, the consideration will be present to the Government of India that there may be strategic advantage rather than otherwise in air ports used by foreign Powers being situated in Empire territory, so that such Powers become dependent on us for facilities of which they would be deprived in the event of war. i. It seems possible, in view of the technical difficulties of running a service over the Pamirs and the iiiiluence of the Soviet Government in Sinkiang? that a regular German service via Sinkiang is at present impracticable. There is thus a chance that if the service smould reach Kabul, the German Government might seek permission to fly across India and Burma to join the services run in China by 'Eurasia'. The Germans could not V- of course be given facilities to fly from Kabul across the prohibited area on the North West Frontier; but it might Be necessary in the circumstances to offer on suitable conditions facilities on the route Iran-Karachi-DeIni• Thus the question of conceding such facilities may conceivably arise in any case.4. ..he suggestion made in paragraph 2 above will be considered in all its aspects by the standing Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications and the Secretary of State consequently hopes to receive the Government of India’s views upon it as soon as possible. 5. In the event of it being clear that a German air service is to be established in Afghanistan, it might be desirable to make an attempt to reinsure British influence in aviation matters at Kabul by offering to give financial and technical assistance to the Afghan government in starting the required ground organisation m their country. The Secretary of State recognises that trie cost of such assistance is at present beyond the reoources of tne government of India’s Afghan Reserve Fund, out he would oe glad of their views on the policy involved. It would of course be necessary to proceed with great caution, as an offer prematurely made might have the effect cf encouraging the establishment of foreign air services in Afghanistan. ; r.

If any points of interest arise at the Committee, however, the 1.0. would communicate them at once to the G. of I. The 1.0. are represented on the Committee. As far as the P#0. are concerned I presume that we would prefer that the German service should go across India rather than Afghanistan - (except that this would appear to make it easier for the Germans to complete their connexion with the Par East, via Burma and Yunnan, but in time of peace only). Para. 5 of the A.M. memo below quotes statements made by Lord Swinton and Sir S. Hoare at the Cabinet of June 2 (W 11818/113/27). These seem to be largely irrelevant to the present question and were not endorsed by the C.I.D. on June 17. It seems to me that the vital interests concerned are those of the Govt, of India; but that so far as the P.0, are concerned, it would be preferable for the service to go across India whe*e it would at any rate be subject to British control. My view is that, pace Lord Swinton and Sir S. Hoare, we don 1 1 want to see this German Par Eastern service established at all, if we can help it. We should there fore only offer facilities in India if it is clear that (SD. ) B.A.B. BURROWS. 20. 7. (SD. ) G.

(The Air Ministry seem to misunderstand the position when they speak of there being ’’still time to divertthe German service from Afghanistan”). I agree with Mr. Burrows that paragraph 5 of the Air Ministry memorandum is irrelevant. If we were dependent on German transit facilities point (e) in that paragraph might he relevant; hut, as far as I know, no British long-distance air route goes through German territory. (SD. ) L.

Sir, Ulth reference to the correspondence ending with Lieutenant Colonel Erase r-Tytler’s telegran No. 58 of the 15th June last, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter which is being sent by the India Office to the Government of India regarding the proposed German air service to iabul. 2. I approve the language used by Lieutenant Colonel Fraser Tytler to the Afghan Government on this subject, as reported in his despatch No. 34 of the 26th March last and m his telegram No. 52; and you may, if you think it desirable, confirm to them that the position as regards the Iraqi Government (who have since agreed to give transit facilities to the German service) is as stated in the third paragraph of his despatch No. 34 of the 26th March last. 3. You should continue to encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities for the German service. If the latter should obtain facilities in Egypt and Iran as well as in Iraq, the Afghan Government might be encouraged to ask the German Government where it would go after Kabul and whether facilities for that part of the route have been obtained. This 'light of course have the effect, if, as seems likely, transit rights in Cinkiang are unobtainable, of causing the German Government to accroach His Majesty's Government for facilities in India and Burma. It might also be suggested Afghan Government that a service terminating at ^ A-S.H. Macann. Kabul/ eto -&gt; etc., etc., Kabul. ''1 r i ! VKabul is unlikely to pay its way, and that there might therefore be a danger, especially if the policy of the German Government should change, that after a period the service might be withdrawn, like the old Junkers service in Iran, leaving the Afghan Government saddled with a Soviet Service, if they had had to agree to that in order to counter Soviet suspicions of the German service. 4. It arrears that the German Government owe much of their success in preparing for these services to their method of representing to each government concerned that they alone are holding up the introduction of a service, for which the governments of all the other countries on the route are ready and waiting. In order to hinder the successful utilisation of this device, I propose to keep you informed as far as possible of the course ^f the German Government’s negotiations with the other governments concerned; and you may use the information sent to you in whatever way you think best. I enclose herein a memorandum prepared in May last giving a general view of the question of German penetration into civil aviation in the East and the attitude to be adopted towards it. 5. I shall also be glad of your views on the question of possible British assistance in the ground organisation for air services in Afghanistan, which is raised in the fifth oaragraph of the letter to the Government of India. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and of its enclosures to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Bagdad, Athens, Tehran, Peking, Bangkok and Berlin; and I am communicating/coramunicating with the first four of these in the sense of the fourth paragraph above. I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) .-AUriSJ'iUfe COL.UES6872/113/27) GERMAN PENETRATION IF CIVIL AVIATION IN THE NJl/iR AND FAR BAST . ( Memorandum by the Air Ministry and Foreign Office ) I. Ever since the advent of the Nazi Regime in Germany, there has been evidence of increased German activity abroad in the many fields which •ffer favourable opportunities for the expansion of German influence and commerce, and during the last two years these activities have been intensified in the field of civil aviation no less than in other fields. If these activities in South East Europe and in the Near and Par 'East are viewed not in isolation as mere attempts at local penetration, but as the co-ordinated development of a single policy, then their definite purpose becomes readily apparent, and that is the vigorous revival of the ’’Drang Nach Osten” in the air. The progress which Germany is making in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan apd China is briefly indicated below. The German efforts in each of these countries should be regarded as part of one whole plan. H. GREECE . In pursuance of her policy of expansion Germany managed te obtain a concession from Greece for Deutsche Luft Hansa to extend their service from Sofia to Salonica in 1932. Co-«peration/Go— operation was next established with the Greek company which had obtained the concession (icaros) for the development of air lines in Greece, and this afforded the German company the opportunity to improve their foothold, which the international situation has subsequently enabled them to consolidate. Last November, taking advantage of the changes in the Greek Government, the Ger ians were able to negotiate favourable Governmental and inter-company agreements under which the Deutsche Luft Hansa, in addition to their service to Salonica, have secured rights to operate to Athens and Rhodes from the direction of Sofia and also d»om that of Venice. In virtue of the inter-company agreement the Deutsche Luft Hansa and the Greek Air Line now reoresent each other reciprocally in Germany and Greece. Moreover the German Company undertakes to put its chief technical expert at Deceleia at the disposal of the Greek Air Line free of charge. The service to Athens was inaugurated in January of this year and the agreements referred to above have secured for Germany the necessary transit rights for services further afield. But this is not the whole extent of German penetration. A school for training Greek civil pilots for the Greek air lines has been established by the Germans at Salonica and Greek pilots also receive training on the German air lines operating between Germany and Greece. German aircraft are being sold to Greece at attractive prices. German money and propaganda, and above all Germany s state-controlled economic policy have established a strangle hold over Greece which is likely to close down still further on/on British interests in the field of civil aviation. There can be little doubt that the attractions offered by Germany are partly responsible for the difficulties which impede our present negotiations f.r a new Air Convention with Greece The harm which this German penetration can do to British interests may well pass beyond the commercial sphere and assume a strategical aspect, Germany obtaining aerodrome and repair facilities in Greek territory which might some day enable her to threaten our Mediterranean communications. III. EGYPT . As Turkey has firmly closed her doors, Egypt is the next goal for a German route to the East. German influence was brought to bear upon Taher Pasha, Vice-Chairman of Misr Airwork, the Anglo-Egyptian concessionaire company subsidised by the Egyptian Government, In 1936 proposals were made for the formation, under Taher Pasha s chairmanship, of a German-Egyptian company styled 'HORUS', to be financed and subsidised by Germany, for a service between Athens and Egypt in the first instance. The fact that the Vice-Chairman of the Egyptian National Company should be associated with this enterprise is an indication cf the extent of German intrigue. As the result of the vigorous opposition which we were able to prompt in Ministerial quarters in Egypt, combined with the Egyptian Government’s lack of enthusiasm for the Project, the application for Horus to establish this service was rejected. Defeated in this line of approach, the Germans in December last formally applied for temporary permission to operate a service between Berlin and Cairo, via/ Vvia Athens and Rhodes 'which would facilitate intellectual and commercial relations between Germany and Egypt', and 'would eventually extend beyond the Egyptian Frontiers'. Permission to make experimental flights before the end of 1936 was requested. Various pretexts have been advanced for holding off this application, but it seems likely that the Egyptian Government will feel bound in the long run to accord facilities, at least for transit services, especially as the Germans have offered to forego passenger traffic in Egypt. In the meantime, the recent 'Oasis' race has afforded with this in view a large passenger aircraft flown by two picked German military pilots was sent, with a number of other modern aircraft, to participate. The aircraft, having completed its task in Egypt, has proceeded to Iraq and will, from there, continue its demonstration in Iran and Afghanistan, is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, and in order to avert this eventuality discussions are now proceeding with Imperial Airways Limited, with a view to their participation in the shareholding in Misr Airwork in the event of Airwork Limited being unable to take up the balance of their allotted capital holding. !V. IRAQ. Information concerning future German air projects in Iraq is at present somewhat vague. The country is already served by three well-established air lines - Imperial Ai-ways, t the Germans an opnortunity of impressing local opinion, and The influence of Taher Pasha is being directed to displacing British interests in Misr Airwork by German. If he Air France (Air Orient) and K.L.M. - in addition to a Bagdad Cairo/Cairo shuttle service run by Misr Airwork, a combined British- Bgyptian organisation, and a shuttle service run by Air Prance between Damascus and Bagdad. Any German venture would therefore from its inception have to contend with health competition. Feeder services within Iraq will, if financial considerations allow, in all probability be operated by the Iraqis themselves, particularly as the Iraqi Government are very anxious to establish a 'national 51 air service, and the reorganisation of the Royal Iraqi Air Force is understood to include the building up of a 'civilian reserve' of pilots. It is known that Germany, through the Luft Hansa Company, has schemes, however nebulous they may be at present, for the extension of civil air routes operating via Bagdad through Persia to the Par East, and Iraqi reactions to such tentative proposals as have been advanced through the medium of the German Consul in Bagdad have not been entirely unfavourable. The risk exists that if Iraq cannot obtain from His Hajesty’s Government a satisfactory offer of modern military aircraft for the expansion of her air force she may turn to the Germans who are very anxious to step in. If this risk materialises the Germans would be in a favourable position to ask for preferential treatment for their civil aviation, or to enter the local market for civil aircraft, e.g. as the essential foreign element in any 'national' Iraqi Company. It is understood from a recent despatch from His Majesty f s Ambassador at Bagdad that the Iraqi Government have decided in principle that there is no objection to the organisation by the Luft Hansa of an Air Service across Iraq to Kabul.V. IRAN. in February 1927, the Junkers Persian Air Transportation Company, a German enterprise controlling most of the commercial aviation in Iran, commenced working internal services from Teheran to Baku, Bushire, Bagdad and Meshed. But the venture closed down in March 1932, mainly owing to the financial collapse of the parent Junkers company in Germany. Actually the Luft Hansa took over the Junkers organisation, and may have made odd flights, but all regular services ceased from the date the Junkers Company liquidated its contract with the Iranian Government. During the recent visit to Teheran of Dr. Schacht, however, the re-inauguration of civil air routes in Iran under German operation is understood to have been discussed. The tentative proposals provided for (a) a through line from Berlin to Kabul via Bagdad and Teheran, with. Kermanshah and Hamadan as emergency landing grounds and two other emergency landing grounds between Teheran and Meshed; (b) subsidiary feeder lines within Iran to be operated by Junker aircraft. (c) all ground organisation to be in the hands of German operatives. The latest information available suggests that whilst the Iranians might agree to (a) and to the presence of a limited number of German mechanics at the aerodromes, (b) and (c) would be refused. These negotiations may be affected by the agreement for the establishment of a service between Teheran and Bagdad which is understood to have been reached recently by the Iranian/ VIranian Government with the Iraqi Government. VI. AFGHANISTAN . German penetration in civil aviation in Afghanistan has not as yet achieved any tangible results, but there is considerable evidence to show that the German authorities are taking seriously their plan to run an air service to Kabul and, if possible, beyond there to Sinkiang, China and possibly Japan. (The Japanese have also shown interest in the scheme). The route beyond Afghanistan would not appear to offer many commercial advantages and for some time to come the operational difficulties would appear to be very considerable. I.ioreover, Soviet influence, which is very strong in Sinkiang, is likely to be an obstacle. But in the course of a visit to Kabul in July 1956 a German Junker 6-seater aeroplane made a reconnaissance up to the Chinese frontier. An attempt was made t« cross the Pamir, but the aircraft was unable to gain sufficient height. Soon after this two Germans established a meteorological station on the top of a pass in northern Afghanistan at which observations were taken throughout the winter. It is evident, however, that the Germans would like to start a service to 1 abul even if they could not go beyond. The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty's Minister at Kabul on 3rd February that the German Charg£ d r Affaires had informed him that the German Government had decided to establish a through service from Berlin to the Far East and asked the permission of the Afghan Government to Fly across their territory.. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied that the Afghan Government would consider this request when they knew that the German Government had agreed with the Iraqi and Persian Governments for passage acrosstheir territories. The Afghan Pri me Minister subsequently asked His Majesty's Minister whether His ajesty's Government could not influence the Iraqi Government to refi lse permission for the German service to cross Iran hi = „ . . , iraq. ms Majesty's Minister did not encourage this idea. Oho r, Ir aqi Government have now granted permission for the Service). The Gervnan representative at Cairo informed the Egyptian Government on 27th March that the eastern terminus of their proposed line for which they wanted facilities in Egypt was 'Kabul to begin with”. The German machine mentioned in paragraph 5 of Section m ( Lgypt ) haS also f:Lown t0 Kabul , but it is not known whether the officers in charge of it carried the negotiations any further. A German ex-officer pilot is at present in ] abul engaged on renovating two old Afghan Junker aeroplanes. It was thought that he was intended to create the nucleus of an Afghan civil aviation service, but the Afghan Prime Minister has told Colenel Praser-Tytier that this is not strictly true, though it was proposed to employ such aircraft as the Afghan Government possess on civil duties. The Commander of the Afghan Air Porce is about to leave this country for Berlin. vn * china . Working from the other end of the chain, Germany has secured a foothold in China, but her attempts to push westwards have hitherto been unsuccessful. In 1931 the Sino-German Company 'Murasia” was formed for the development of internal air services in China, and for the opening up of a route through Manchuria and Siberia to Europe. Russia was obdurate, however, and this latter part the scheme proved obortive. n The/The Germans, with regard to the therefore, instituted informal inquiries possibility of Eurasia extending their Shanghai-Yunnanfu service to Rangoon or Calcutta. We agreed with the Government of India that this extension could not be permitted, and that if an air connection with Europe was desired by the Sin*-German Company, it should be made at Hong hong by means of Imperial Airways Limited's service. It seems likely that an application by Eurasia to fly to Hong long will, in fact, shortly be received. In February last, however, the Manager of the Company made it clear to our Air Attache in Shanghai that the main objective of German civil aviation policy in the East is still a direct service between Berlin and Shanghai, and it is evident that they are bending all their efforts in that direction. VIII. Prom the commercial standpoint this penetration by Germany in the Near and Par Past can only be viewed with disquiet. In the attainment of her objective, money seems to be no obstacle; pioneering flights are undertaken ana services started without regard to expense. The local organisations which are created at the places of call of German air lines serve as focal points for the spread of German influence which is also fostered by the undoubted high standard of the services invariably provided, and by the efficiency of the material and personnel employed. The route in prospect traverses fertile fields for the goowth of this influence. If Germany gains control of civil aviation/ablation in the minor States along this route, her methods will make it hard to displace her. Trade also follows the flag. The fact that British influence runs counter to her purpose goes some way to explain the present deterioration of our relations with Germany in civil aviation in Europe and her desire to extort concessions for every facility accorded to us. It aooounts for Germany’s recent desire to extend the Anglo—German Air Navigation Convention to include British overseas territories, a request to which no official answer was returned, although it was unofficially intimated that it did not meet with our approval. It also accounts for her representations that the absence of colonies cramps her developments in civil aviation. The strategic aspect is not here directly in question, but the prospect of a German air line being firmly established as a conductor rail supplying motive force for centres of German 'Kultur” along one of the main lines of our Umpire communications cannot be regarded with less misgiving from that standpoint than from the commercial angle. 22nd April, 1937.)raft Paper. ^ ^77 SecCdvr ftw\~Wv The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department^ SIMLA. , &lt;L.(\ • 1 ^, v v 37 ■ { SENT GY AIR MAIL I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the corresi ondence ending with Kabul telegram flo.52 of 15th June regarding the proposed German air service to Kabul.

It might also be suggested to the Afghan Government that a service terminating at Kabul is unlikely to pay its way; and that there might therefore be a danger, especially if the policy of the German Government should change, that after a period the service might be withdrawn, like the old Junkers service in Iran, leaving the Afghan Government saddled with a Soviet Service, if they had had to agree to this in order to counter Soviet suspicions regarding the German service. 4.

GERMAN PENETRATION IN THE NEAR - AND FAR EAST. (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1329-B and 1333-B.) (Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 252nd Meeting, Minute 10.; THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Secretary;# covering a Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Air and Cabinet Conclu sions thereon (C.I.D. Paper No. 1329-B), and a Memorandum by the Secretary ., of State for India (C.I.D. Paper No. 1333-B). THE PRIME MINISTER asked Lord Zetland to introduce the subject. : iii LORD ZETLAND said that his views were contained in the Memorandum flfl before the Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1333-B). Briefly, the position was tha%(ioE the Germans were applying to the Afghan Government for facilities to open an^nni air route through Afghanistan. Neither India nor Afghanistan were anxious , that such a scheme should materialise, because it would make it difficult to refuse . similar facilities to the Soviet Government. The Germans had obtained the consent of Iraq for their proposals, but not, as yet, that of Iran. Thus, there was still time to take such action as might divert the German service from§i\L Afghanistan. This had led him to make the first suggestion^(a) in liis rJt ( Memorandum—namely, that the Government of India should be asked whether j|p|j they would be prepared to offer facilities on the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi. The second suggestion in his Memorandum was that His Majesty’s Minister in Kabul should be instructed to discuss the matter further with the Afghan^ Government. This had actually been done, and he had with him a telegram which had just been received from our Minister in Kabul. The Minister reportedly that he had been approached by the Afghan Foreign Minister, who had stated^ that the German Charge d’Affaires had once more returned to the charge with the request that the necessary facilities for the German route should be granted ' by the Afghan Government, on the grounds that similar facilities had now been obtained from the Iraq Government. The Afghan Foreign Minister had then asked the German Charge d’Affaires whether permission had also been given by . y the Iran Government, and on being informed that it had not, he had replied that the German request could not be considered until this permission had likewise He been granted. His Majesty’s Minister had then asked the Afghan Foreignuh Minister whether the Germans were seeking facilities for a terminal service toai-I Kabul or for a transit service. The Afghan Minister had replied that theira®] request was for a transit service. Our Minister had then suggested that such ^ transit facilities would presumably be conditional on the consent of the Chinese y Government for the prolongation of the German route through Sin-kiang. The Afghan Minister had agreed in thinking that this would be the case. He had y added that his Government felt very uneasy about the whole project, particularly with regard to the difficulties in which it might involve them with the Soviet ;: y Government, who would almost certainly ask for similar concessions. It wouldij^ thus be seen, observed Lord Zetland, that the action taken by our Minister m Kabul was the answer to the second proposal, (5), which he had made m his sy Memorandum. In his third proposal, (c), he had suggested that— “as it might well prove difficult to dissuade the Afghan Government '• from proceeding with the German project, and it would be a mistake o press them too strongly (especially if the Government of India were them selves prepared to give facilities for a German service by the Karachi r°u _y it might be desirable to consider whether we should not aim at reinsuring |y t our influence in aviation matters at Kabul by offering to give financial an technical assistance to the Afghan Government in starting the giounc y organisation for air services in that country.”[15420] D ft THE 17 He would like to make one comment in particular on the wording of this proposal as he had originally phrased it namely, with regard to the word ‘‘ dissuade. . From the account which he had just given of the interview between our Minister m Kabul ami he Afghan Foreign Minister, it would now be clear to the Committee that the Afghan Government were in no need of “ dissuasion ” »He would, however, like to have the opinion of the Committee on this last proposal of his. LORD SWINTON asked whether we should not make the Germans and tb^ mnrp anYinns to nroseente thpir 1 .

If; ^ LORD ZETLAND felt that the problem could be viewed from two angles One view was that, if landing facilities were to be granted in Afghanistan it would be preferable that they should be under our own control. The other view was that it might be wiser to do nothing. THE PRIME MINISTER asked who was meant by “we” with regard to the suggestion that financial and technical assistance should be given to the Afghan Government. Wttol LORD ZETLAND replied that he had meant that this assistance should be given by His Majesty’s Government. He felt that the Indian Government had done as much as they could. LORD HALIFAX took the view that, unless His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India were prepared to help, the Afghan Government might be awkwardly placed in having to refuse German or Russian assistance. LORD ZETLAND agreed. SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said that the Foreign Office would prefer to see neither the Germans nor the Russians in Afghanistan, and suggested that it would not be beyond the capacity of the Afghan Government to play one off against the other, as they had on many occasions in the past. LORD SWINTON said that in discussing the problem when it came before the Cabinet he had pointed out that two broad principles were involved—one the freedom of the air in relation to the development of civil aviation, and the other our strategical interests. The first proposal— (a) in Lord Zetland’s Memo randum-raised a large number of questions which would require careful examination. He therefore recommended that this particular aspect of the problem—namely, the diversion of the proposed German service along the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi, should be referred to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications under Sir Warren Fisher. LORD HALIFAX considered that Sir Robert Vansittart’s argument that we should aim at excluding both Germany and Russia from Afghanistan carried great force, and he suggested that it might be put into practice on the lines contained in proposal (c) of Lord Zetland’s Memorandum. THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but added a caveat that it would be necessary to proceed slowly. LORD SWINTON then raised the question of German air activities in Igypt Our local interests in that country were at present bound up with an -^-Kgyptian Company called Misr Airwork. The Germans had been c allengingthese interests in an attempt to form a rival Company—“The Horos A nC m AT 5 g Lliese interests m an attempt to torm a rival wumpyu.y— xnc xxuiuo do be financed and subsidised by Germany. The Air Ministry were trying to d Imperial Airways to help Misr Airwork with a view to excluding German influence. Mr. EDEN suggested that similar difficulties might arise in Iraq. TORO SWINTON felt that Imperial Airways had already done as much l be expected of a commercial concern. He added that he would like to : Ve principle recognised that, where there were British interests involved . A ^ernal air line, we should not allow them to be squeezed out by foreign C( ®ipetition.THF PEIME MINISTER asked Lord Swinton if he would go further into the question of British interests in Air Lines in Egypt and Iraq with a view to suggesting what more could be done.

Should, ths owner be a.t war with the users, the Port is denied to the latter and it follows that the more Ports one owns and the greater the dependence on them by foreigners the better position one is in from every point of view. The same applies to Air Ports. The Empire should therefore aim at establishing Air Ports in Empire Territory and at making these essential to others. Failing Empire Air Ports we should encourage them in friendly countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq. in terms of Air Services, the Air Ports are what matter, and we should be well advised to aim at getting some sort of controlling influence in those in Afghanistan and Iraq, rather than in competing for Air Services to these countries. 2.

In accordance wifli 'tlie Cabinef conclusions on 'the 2nd June the memorandum prepared by the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office regarding the proposed German air route I to the Far East and the Cabinet discussions thereon have been referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence and are on the Agenda of the Meetingjfon Thursday, 17th June. The Cabinet Secretariat (Wing-Commander Elliott) think that it may have to be referred to a sub-committee and they have asked us to circulate a memorandum. A draft of such a memorandum is attached. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will probably like to subscribe to it and it could easily be turned into a joint memorandum. The Committee of Imperial Defence Secretariat are anxious - to have it to-morrow (Tuesday). The Defence of India Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence considered the question air services in Afghanistan in 193V. In paragraph 53 of their report they said: 'In this connection Sir Francis jj Humphy^-s had suggested to us that our relations wi th Afghanistan might be materially improved and our position | substantially strengthened if we were to assist the King more actively in the development of his country. The directions in which this might be_done are briefly these (eV The' establishment and maintenance of a civil air service between Kabul and Peshawar, conducted by British pilots and subsidised by the Government of India, j This would, we think, have the great advantage of ousting the Russo-Afghan air force and would give British pilots experience of re^lar flying over Afghan territory.There is, however, the practical difficulty that the Legislative Assembly might not be willing to vote the necessary funds for a flying service of this kind. We attach great importance to the proposal and trust that it will be possible to overcome this difficulty. Here again, however, the initiative must come from King Amanullah himself. u In considering this report.in January, 1928, the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to approve the Sub committee's conclusions which they said ’'may be summarised as follows:- U) A friendly Afghanistan being a primary condition of the military plans referred to in 2 above, it is important that any opportunities of further improving our relations with Afghanis tankhould be taken / if possible. Some of the measures which might be adopted to that end are&gt;f(e) the establishment and maintenance of a civil air service between Kabul and Pesnawar conducted by British pilots and subsidised by the Government of India. ” At that time there was a regular civil air service run by the Russians between Tashkent and Kabul, and it was clearly desiraole to establish a British service to Kabul in 02 ?der to counter, so far as possible, the influence of the Russian service. Since 1929, however, tne regular Russian service has been closed down and all that is left is an arrangement whereby Russian planes are permitted, on sufferance, to carry diplomatic mail and personnel for the Soviet Embassy at Kabul. This arrangement is not a cause of much anxiety to us and, tnerefore, the factors which made a British service to Raoul desirable in 1927 do not, at present, exist.

The locus classicus on our present policy towards air services in Afghanistan is Sir Samuel Hoare's despatch to the (Government of India of the 10th May, 1934, in which he said: ”1 greatly welcome the attitude of Your Excellency’s Government set out in paragraph 5 of your despatch of the 5th June, 1933, on the question of the offer made by the Afghan Government in 1930 of an agreement for an air service from India to Kabul^ in the event of their entering into any agreement with the Soviet Government for the operation of air services in Afghanistan. At the same time, I concur in your view that it is to be hoped that occasion for taking up this option may not be forced on your —-4 ' Government by Soviet-Afghan agreement^ since it is clear that the Soviet Government would gain greater advantages from the Soviet air service to Kabul or Kandahar than could be obtained on the Indian side from a complementary agreement. u In case there have been further developments at Kabul regarding the German plans since Colonel fraser- Tytler’s last despatch on the subject we might telegraph to him as in the attached draft.

In connexion with C.I.D.paper No.1329-B 3 regarding the proposed German air service to Kabul, I circulate as arranged at the Cabinet Meeting of 2nd June a memorandum on certain aspects of this project which have a bearing on our strategic and political interests in Afghanistan and on the North West Frontier of India. 2. fo make these clear it is necessary to give a short resume of the recent history of the question of air services in Afghanistan and in particular to explain the position regarding a possible Soviet air service in that country. Question of a soviet Service . 3. The Soviet Government have frequently in recent years, particularly during the period 1930—1933, asked the Afghan Government to permit the establishment of a regular commercial air service from Termez to Kabul in place of the present arrangement, which has existed on an irregular and precarious basis since 1929, whereby about four tames a month diplomatic mails and passengers are flown to and from the soviet Embassy at Kabul. The Aighan Government have consistently refused to do.penetration and communist intrigue and propaganda; and in 1932 told the Soviet Government that the present arrangement ma^ continue only so long as adequate road communications to the Soviet frontier do not exist, a defect winch they are working to remove. on the other hand the Afghan Government might not oe able to afford a definite split with the Soviets over this question, especially if they had given facilities for a German service. 4. The establisliment of Soviet air services in Afghanistan would be contrary to our interests both as increasing Soviet influence and as facilitating the aquisition of an air base south of the Hindu ICush. it is particularly desirable to exclude a Soviet air service (and in a lesser degree other foreign air services) from Afghan territory lying east and south of Kabul, in view of the special opportunities it would give for propaganda in the tribal areas on the North West Frontier and the possibility that the flight of foreign aircraft near those areas might prejudice British prestige. 5. In 1930 an undertaking was obtained from the Afghan Government by H.M.Minis ter at Kabul that if a convention were concluded for the establishment on a / fca&amp;i ia regular basis of an air service between Russia and Afghanistan, His Majesty.s Government would be given the option of a corresponding agreement for a service between Afghanistan and India. The late King Nadir also said in 1931, in answer to an explanation of the grave concern which would be caused to us by a Soviet service to the Indian Frontier, that he would never qgree to the operation of such a service eastwards of the Kabul-Kandahar line. The Soviet Government would gain greater advantages from a Soviet air service to Kabul than would we from a complementary British service^ and consequently it has not been in our interest to take the initiative in establishing a British service to Kabul as this would have made it easier for the Soviet Government to obtain a service on their side. 6. In 1935 the Soviet Government reopened the question of a Soviet service to Kabul and the Afghan Foreign Minister raised it with H.M.Minister, Kabul. He explained that the road to the Soviet frontier was nearing completion and that the Afghan Government would consequently have to consider their future policy regarding the Soviet air service. He asked for the advice of His Majesty*s Government onaproject lor an air service between Europe and India via Afghanistan in/in which the section through Northern Afghanistan would be covered by a Husso— Afghan service ; and enquired whether His Majesty*s Goveriunent would take up thei option by co-operating in an Indo-Afghan service in S .E.Afghanistan which would link with the Husso-Afghan service* After considerable dis cussion between H.M.Minister, Kabul, the Government of India and the Departments of His Majesty*s Government concerned, the Afghan Government were informed in February 1937 that such a service did not seem to be a commercial proposition, which suggested that the Soviet Government *s interest in the matter might have ulterior and non-commercial motives, and that for these reasons the Afghans could not be advised to pursue the project* The negotiations between the Soviet and Afghan Governments had in the meanwhile broken down on the point of Afghan participation in the service and the Afghan Government were told that in view of this His Majesty*s Government assumed that they would not expect an answer to their enquiry whether His Majesty's Government would exercise their option to co-operate m a service from Kabul to India, but that they would be glad to be kept informed of any development. This the Afghan Government promised to do.The 11 prohibited area 11 on the 7. A ,f prohibited area” is maintained by the Government of India covering Baluchistan, the North-West Frontier province (including our tribal areas) and much of Kashmir, in which no civil aircraft may fly# This is necessary to obviate the danger of forced landings in unadministered tribal territory, which might well lead to 'incidents”. The establishment of a British service to Kabul would necessitate the creation of a 'corridor” through this 'prohibited area”. The International Aerial Navigation Convention would debar us from preventing occasional flights by foreign civil aircraft in this 'corridor' although refusal to allow a second regular air service to use it would not, be a breach of the convention. Question of a German service when mooted in ±y'S2 l 8. His Majesty^ Government had cause to consider their attitude towards a German air service in Afghanistan in 193S when the German Minister at Kabul enquired regarding our probable attitude towards a service by Junkers from Tehran via Herat, Kandahar, Kabul to Dakka (near the Indian frontier west of the Khyber Pass). The view of the Government of India was that though any foreign air line south-east of Kandahar or Kabul would be politically objectionable, nevertheless in order to keep/keep oat a Russian service they‘would regard a Gen - lJ:: ser vice to Uakka with benevolence. Eventually, the German Legation at Kabul was told that they could count on our good will but that there could be no question of Junkers extending their service into India or of carrying British mail, nor would there be any air connection with India. It was hoped that this statement would persuade Junkers not to go further than Kabul. In ■Uict, they decided for financial reasons not to pursue the matter at all. Conclusion. ^• It will be seen that the project of a German air service to Kabul is open to certain objections from the point of view of India. It would represent a substantial extension of German economic influence m Afghanistan, which, in view of the proximity of Kabul to the dorth-West Frontier, and the possibility of its unfavourable reactions on te attitude of the Soviet Government to Afghanistan, could hardly be regarded as satisfactory. The Afghan Government fear that the establishment of a German air service would lead the Soviet Government to press for a Soviet service to Kabul, and it might not be easy for them to resist such pressure. On the other hand, I recognise that it may be an advantage rather than otherwise that air ports used by foreign Pov/ers should be situated in Empire territory, so that such Powers become de pen dent/air dependent on as for facilities of which they would be deprived in the event of war and iailing Empire territory, there may be some advantage in the situation of such ports m countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq, which are friendly to us. Takin fc these various factors into account, I would suggest as a possible plan for the consideration of the Committee:-* (a) that the Government of India might be asked now whether they would be prepareci to oiler facilities on the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi. This might possibly result in the diversion of the proposed German service from Afghanistan. (b) That H.M. Minister at Kabul should be instructed to discuss the matter with the Afghan Government; it might perhaps be suggested to the latter that if Egypt and Persia as well as Iraq accord transit facilities to the German service, and consequently the German Government make a fresh approach at Kabul, 'the Afghan Government should ask where the proposed service would go after Kabul and whether facilities have been obtained; it might also perhaps be suggested to the Afghan Government that a service terminating at Kabul is unlikely to pay its way, and that there might therefore be a danger that after a period it might be withdrawn, like the old Junkers service in Persia, leavingf the Afghan Government saddled with a Soviet service, if they had had to agree to this in order to counter Soviet suspicions regarding the German service. (c) As it may well prove difficult to dissuade the Afghan Government from J*—'■ '1^ proceeding with the German project, and it would be a mistake to press them too strongly (especially if the Government of India were themselves prepared to give facilities for a German service by the Karachi route), it might be desirable to consider whether we should not aim at reinsuring our influence in aviation matters at Kabul by offering to give financial and technical assistance to the Afghan Government in starting the ground organisation for air services in that country.§£CR£1 1329-B ^ ^ ; 1 COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for Air (C.P. 145(37)) circulating for the inform ation of his colleagues a Memorandum on the subject of German penetration in civil aviation in the Near and Par East, which had been submitted to him by the Inter-Depart mental Committee on International Air Communications. The Secretary of State proposed to circulate the Memorandum also to the Conmittee of Imperial Defence, and suggested that copies should be transmitted to the Dominions and Colonies concerned, and to the Government of India. The Memorandum briefly indicated the progress Germany was making in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan and China, and suggested that the German efforts in each of these countries should be regarded as part of one whole plan directed towards expansion of German influence and commerce in the Near aid Par East. The Secretary of Statefor Air said that his memorandum dealt with German activities, but he wished to make some remarks on the general policy governing civil aviation. The^pollcy which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom/had &amp;mm at at the International Conference on Civil Aviation some years ago was one of complete freedom in the air, that is to say that airports should be as free for civil aviation as commercial ports were for the mercantile marine. had failed to secure that policy at the International Conference. The result had been that we had been driven into a policy of reciprocal concessions. Every case had had to be the subject of a bargain. Portunately, we hadhitherto not been badly situated for such7 a policy snd. had gensrally D 66 n able t-o obbain a useful quid pro quo, for any concesa.ons made. I'he subject had recently been considered oy the Civil Air Communications Committee of the Imperial Confeience# H.e was glad to be able to say that tbe resolution adopted had been in favour of the Governments of the Empire always playing as a combined team. He had hardly hoped for so good aresult. All the Delegations con cerned had been represented by Ministers except South Africa, but he thought there was every prospect of securing acceptance of the resolution by the Imperial Conference. His own view was that it was just as impossible to keep the air Powers out of world civil aviation as it was to stop the development of mercantile services in world shipping. He thought it was impossible to do more than to use our Empire geographical position to ensure the fullest reciprocity and the best bargain in each case. That policy must be subject to three conditions - establishment of uneconomic services. This, for example, had justified our attitude towards the development oif German air services to %ypt and the pressure we had put on the Australian Govern ment to refuse permission for the establishment of a Dutch air service to Australia: (a) We must avoid cut-throat competition and the important strategic interest: ourselves: ^ K-n; wq ft ftirfiadv using the double ergu- second, that if Germany had colonies she 43 her owi i‘-!/ e &lt; . 1 £i e Ljf 0rS had n0t been raised at the ►fee—ce, but the Caoinet were bound to take them into ITALY. Negotiat ions with. consideration. The Home Secretary supported the view of the Secretary Oj- State j_or -Air. In the past we had been right to adopt an exclusive policy for the reason that the question of national prestige had been involved in the development of British air communications. The situation was not changed and he thought that the policy of air development should be the same as in the case of the mercantial marine. It appeared that the Italian Government were tending to push us out rather than for us to restrict the air services of other foreign countries. On balance, he felt that it was right to deal rather generously with the German Government in this matter with a view to removing their suspicions. The Secretary of State for Air agreed that in Italy we were particularly vulnerable. He had, however, just received a very satisfactory offer from the Italian Government for the use for seven years of hake Bracciano which was the only suitable place for use by seaplanes. The Italians only asked as a quid pro quo for customs facilities in Khartum. He was in cornnunication with the Foreign secretary on tne matter. The Foreign Secretary said that the Sudan authorities were strongly opposed to making this concession to Italy and were backed by His Majesty’s .Ambassador in Egypt. He was not prepared to give an answer at the moment. The Secretary of State for Air said that the only for seaplanes to alight was at Maples alternative place- 4 - where the facilities were dangerous for this purpose by day and unuseable by night* He suggested that the opportunities for intrigue against us afforded by customs facilities were small especially when it was remembered that the Italians already had the right to land at Khartum. If he could not adjust the matter with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he would have to bring it to the Cabinet. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it would be a serious matter if the Empire air services were rendered impracticable. The Secretary of State for Air assured the Cabinet that it was b- physleal imptre^trtMty- to carry through the Empire air route without the use of Italian territory. This was true not only for seaplanes but also for aeroplanes, for which it would be necessary to use an Italian landing ground at Tobruk. Unless the proposal for uake Bracciano could be accepted, the iimpire air mail route could not be carried on by night. The Secretary of State for India said he did not wish to dissent from the proposal of the Secretary of State for Air but he felt bound to mention certain points of difficulty from the point of view of the Government of India. The proposed German routes to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan with possible extension to China were not very acceptable to the Government of Afghanistan. When that Government had been approached by the Germans they had replied that they would give an answer after consent had been given by the Governments of Iraq and Iran. They had hoped that we should take action at Baghdad to stop the consent of the Govern- rfJU . fflent of Iraq. -Both-Governmentfs, however, fheir consent and the Afghanistan Government was coti rented with a difficult decision. There was yet another probable difficulty. The Prime Minister of Afghanistan thought that ^■f the German route were sanctioned, the Soviet Government- 5 - ' would try and establish an air route from Tashkent! to Kabul which the Afghans would dislike. This would involve the opening up of an air route from India to Kabul/, te i^^^ 1 esttoio an gir^^, 0 /f(K^C 'UJ&amp;aS' cPi^-^tce^o . j!^lnh-Md-^ ccn eTo-ood unu-ey -the .: .r,-^ PM: . D ; These were points which would require consideration. He asked how soon the German scheme was likely to come into operation. The Secretary of State for Air said that the Germans had a good many machines which were half civil and half military and should be able to bring their scheme into existence rapidly. He called attention to his suggestion that the point raised by the Secretary of State for India should he considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Secretary of State for India agreed. Tha Home Secretary suggested that if the Germans did obtain permission to establish an air route, we ought to take up at once the question of the India-Kabul air route. Perhaps, we might, with advantage have done this earlier. The Cabinet agreed: (a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should give his personal attention to the request of the Secretary of State for Air that customs facilities should be given to Italian aircraft at Khartum in return for the use of Lake ELracciano by seaplanes for the Umpire air route: (b) That the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on German penetration in the Near and Far East (C.P.145(37)), together with the above summary of the Cabinet discussion, should be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence for consideration and report./W* The Germans are trying to organize an air route from Germany via Athens, Cairo, Baghdad, and Tehran to Kabul and hope subsequently to extend it via Sinkiang to the Far Bast. A note was submitted by the Foreign Office and Air Ministry to the Inter-departmental Committee on International Air Communications setting out the extent to which the Germans have progressed with their plans. The Committee recognised that the strategic aspects of the project were beyond their terms of reference and suggested th^t it should be considered by the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Secretary of State for Air has now submitted the note prepared for the Committee to the Cabinet for their information, with the suggestion that it should be circulated to the Dominions and Colonies concerned, to the Government of India and to the Committee of Imperial Defence. 2. The Afghan Government have replied to the German request for facilities in Afghanistan by saying that they would consider it when agreement had been reached for passage across Syria, Iraq and Persia. They realise that if the 8 erm*n 9 Ret their service the Soviet Government would also demand facilities for a service to Kabul, while xf they refuse the request of the German Government, the latter might be less ready to afford Afghanistan, further economic assistance. There appears to be a split on the subject in the Afghan Government, the younger members beinR anxious for the civilizing influence of air services while the older members are apprehensive of communist penetration. But it flT^vldcn* that i'uhammad Hashim would be glad to be relieved of the necessity of taking a decision, as he made . - 1 Pruaer-Tytlei* that H.M.G. should the suggestion to Colonel eraser use/ - t/s. use their Influence with the Iraqi Oovernrsent to refuse the Germans permission to fly over Iraq. 3. The Iraqi Government have since decided to inform Lufthansa that there is no objection to their operating over Iraq en route to Kabul and the moat recent information about Persia is that the Peraians are more likely than not to give facilities. Complicated negotiations are proceeding regarding Egypt. The Egyptian Government do not like the German project and, prompted by are making stipulations regarding the reservation of short haul traffic to Kisr Airwork to which the Germans have not yet agreed. If, however, their terms are accepted the Egyptians feel that they cannot refuse facilities for a purely transit service. Presumably in Palestine and Syria it is not ponsible under the terms of the mandates to refuse transit facilities. It therefore looks as if the Germans will reach Kabul. 4. It is worth while recalling the line H.M.G. adopted to a proposed German air service from Tehran to Afghanistan in 1939, when our relations with Germany were Government of India said that any foreign air line south east of Kandahar or Kabul would be politically objectionable, but in order to keep out a Russian service they would regard the German service to Bakka with benevolence. Eventually the Germans were told that they could count on our good will, comparatively good. The German Minister at Kabul then asked Sir R.Maconachie our probable attitude to a Junkers service from Herat via Kandahar and Kabul to Dakka* The 1 but thel there could be no question of Junkers extending their service into India or of carrying British mails - nor would there be any air connection with India. It was hoped - nor that/3. that this statement would persuade Junkers to make Kabul they decided for financial reasons not to pursue the matter. 5. The objections to the present German project from the India Office point of view seem to be;- (a) The presence at Kabul of German civil aircraft and personnel would make it much harder to prevent the Germans obtaining undue influence in the Afghan Air Force. In any case it would mark a substantial extension of German economic penetration in Afghanistan. (b) It would, as Muhammad Kashira fears, lead the Soviet Government to press for a regular air service »-3 0iA&amp;, \o*.

I gather from the reports I have seen from time to time in the print sections that the Afghan Government are not very likely to view this project with favour, but in any event one would have supposed that Soviet influence in Sinkiang was quite sufficient to give the Moscow authorities a deciding voice in the matter.p.z. 3390/37.

The progress which Germany is making in Greece* Egypt* Iraq* Persia s Afghanistan and China is briefly indicated below. The German efforts in each of these countries should be regarded as part of one whole piano .11, GREECE. In pursuance of her policy of expansion Germany managed to obtain a concession from Greece for Deutsche hu^t o, their service from Sofia to Salonica in 1952, Co-operation was nezt established with the Greek company which had obtained the concession (Icaros) for the development of air lines in Greece* ana this afforded the German company the opportunity to improve their foothold, which the international situation has subsequently enabled them to consolidate, ta»t Hovemfcer, taking advantage of the changes in the Greek Government* the ^ nn d infer-company agreements negotiate favourable Qowernmtn^^.c &lt;ma inxoi . iunder wrar-U 'ihv D-^uv sc he Luft riaBsa s in addition to their service to Salonica 9 have secured rights to operate to Athens and Rhodes from the direction of Soil a and also from that of Venice In virtue of the .1. nter-company agreement the Deutsche Luft Hansa and the Greek Air Line now represent each other reciprocally in Germany and Greece 0 Moreover the German Company undertakes to puxr iis cn.ir,.^chnical expert at Deceleia at the disposal of the Greek Air Line free of charge. The service to Athens was inaugu rated in January of this year and the agreements referred to above ba^e secured for Germany the necessary transit rights for services » further afield But this is not the whole extent of German penetration c A school for training Greek civil pilots for the Greek air lines has hem established by the Germans at Salon!ca and Greek pilota also receive training on the German air lines opex*ating between Germany and Greece^ German aircraft are being sold to Greece at attractive prices, German money and propagandas and above all Germany’s state- omt rolled economic policy have established a strangle -hoId over Greece which is likely to close down still further on British interest® in the field of civil aviation.. There can be little doubt that the attractions offered by Germany are partly responsible for the difficulties which impede our present negotiations lor a ngw Air Convention with Greece* The harm which this German penetration can do to British interests may well pass beyond the commercial sphere and assume a strategical aspect„ Germany obtaining aerodrome and repair facilities in Greek territory which might some day enable her to threaten our Medi tex*ranean comm uni cations. ]1L - gGtVT o As Turkey has firmly closed her doors, Egypt is the nest goal. l0r u German route to the East* German influence was brought to hear upon Taher Pasha,, vice- -airman £ Miar Alrwork, the Angio-Egyptian concessionaire■ japw subsidised by the Egyptian Guverameat* In 1936 proposals were ^de tor the formation, under Taber Pasha’s chairmanship, of (f e Crermen-Egyptlaii company styled W H0RU3 M £ to be financed and aufcsidised by Germany, for a service between Athena and Kgypt in The ?. act that the Vice-Chairman of the Egyptian National Company ahoold be associated with this enterprise is an indication of the extent of German intrigue. As the result of the rigoroua opposition which we were able to prompt In Ministerial quarters in Egypt, combined with the Egyptian Government's lack of enthusiasm for the pro beef, the application for Horus to establish this service was rejected Defeated la this line of approach, the Germans in December last formally applied for temporary permission to operate a service between Berlin and Cairo, via Athena and Rhodes 'which would iVllitaie intellectual and commercial relations between Germany and Egypt' P and 'would eventually extend beyond the Egyptian Frontiers'* Permission to make experimental flights before the rid of 1936 was requested Various pretexts have been advanced for holding off this sf-plioation, but it seems likely that the Egyptian Government will ffound in the long run to accord facilities, at least tor services, especially as the Germans have offered to Xoiego pahsenger traffic in.

The route beyond Afghanistan would not appear to offer many commercial advantages and for some time to come the operational difficulties would appear to be very considerable. Moreover^ Soviet influence, which is very strong in Sinkiang 5 is likely to be an obstacle. But in the course of a visit to Kabul in July 1956 a German Junker 6~seater aeroplane made a reconnaissance up to the Chinese frontiero An attempt was made to cross the Pamir, but the aircraft was unable to gain sufficient heighto Soon after this two Germans established a meteorological station on the top of a pass in northern Afghanistan at which observations were taken throughout the winter* It ie evident, however, that the Germans would like to atari a service to Kabul even if they could not go heyond.

It seems likely that an application D y Eurasia to fly to Hong Kong will, in fact, shortly be receded.. In February last, however, the Manager of the Company made it clear to our Air Attache in Shanghai that the main object!of German civil aviation policy in the East is still a direct se..vice6 *ion from -he ccjninicrcis! standpoint this penetration by Germany in the Near and Par East can only be viewed with disquiet. In the attainment of her objective, money seems to be no obstacle; pioneering flights are undertaken and services started without regard to expense The local organisations which are created at the places of call of German air lines serve as focal points for the spread of German influence which is also fostered by the undoubted high standard of the services invariably provided, and by the efficiency of the material and personnel employed The route in prospect traverses fertile fields for the growth of this influence.. If Germany gains control of civil aviation in the mtarr States along this route, her methods will make it hard to displace her* Trade also follows the flag.. The fact that British influence runs counter to her purpose goes some way to explain the present deterioration ot our ? . - ? with Germany in civil aviation in Europe and her desire to extort c a eastone for every facility accorded to us* It accounts for Germany's recent desire to extend the Angio- Genaan Air Navigation Convention to include British ov~.. seas territories, a request to which no official answer was returned, although it was unofficially intimated that it did not meet with our approval. It also accounts for her representations that the absence of colonies cramps her developments ii’ The strategic aspect is not here directly in question, the prospect of a German air line being firmly established as a conductor rail supplying motive force for centres of German 'Kultur’ d nf* our Empire coiirniunications cannot be along one of th« main lines ox our - ^ , , froP1 that standpoint than from the regarded with less ■ commer-sial angle. 22nd Aprils 193 ?Extract from ranuteB of 4and Meeting of 1*+^.

There were, however other c ounti ies into whose civil avia.tion Germany was penetrating, e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan and the countries of the Far Fast , out it was difficult to obtain a complete picture of the German ’Draug nach Osten’ in the air if their efforts in these various centres v/ere only considered in isolation. He thought it might be advisable if the position as a whole could be made clear to the Government. The Committee concurred in this suggestion and agreed that the Foreign Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, should prepare a paper setting out the position in regard to this matter for the consideration of the Committee. The paper could then be submitted to Ministers with the Committee’s comments on the effect of German penetration into the countries concerned from the point of view of British-civil avialion interests and with a note that the matter was also of considerable significance in its strategic aspect.BBS!

As all the other competitors in the race were aeroplanes of a more or less sporting type and points were given in the Rally for such factors as comfort, space, equipment etc* , it was more or less a foregone conclusion from the start of the Rally t/at it would be won by the Junkers plane* Because of its new design^ heavy oil engine, etc., it created a considerable stir locally and was undoubtedly the plane on which public interest was concen trated at vlmaza Aerodrome after the race. 2. Captain von Blomberg and his fellow pilot together with the other German competitors in this Rally were made much of in &gt; gypt but would not appear to have established any special contacts with the igyptian authorities. They were, however, in close contact with the Geman Minister who was himself a passenger in the Junkers plane during the Rally, and it is noteworthy that this visit coincided with an/ * Sight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., ®tc*, etc., etc.an attempt by the Ocrmiin minister to Btampede the Egyptian 0ov eminent into giving facilities for a Ger as an air service passing over Egypt. you are aware from my telegram fto.124 of February 24th last and connected correspondence, a request for permission to start trial flights was put forward by the German Legation and during Japtain von Bio -berg f s visit great i pressure was brought to bear upon the Minister for Foreign affairs and the minister of Communications to grant these ^ facilities without delay. It was only a firm stand by the Director General of Civil Aviation supported by the Embassy which enabled this pressure to be withstood in order that the Egyptian Government sight give due consideration first to alternative proposals referred to in my telegram $0,136 of March 4 th. 3. In addition to the Junkers plane piloted by Captain von Blomberg, two other German competitors were among the first five in the Oasis Rally. It is a significant fact also that the JuniterB purchased in Australia should have timed its arrival at for the day before the start of the race and that at the start it was out in the aerodrome waiting to leave *11 this has naturally proved an excellent local advertisement for German aviation and the advertisement ^ili carried down to Cape Town as Herr von Gronau, one of the above-mentioned competitors» proceeded there after the : ace. In t .is connexion I would draw attention to the definite increase in German activities in F.gypt which has tae-en place unct the visit of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance to Berlin in .ugust last. This has been noticeable particularly In the commercial field and you will see from my despatch Ho. 171 K of February 4th last that ..Feral schemes die undei consideration for setting up German enterprises in ' OT t and for increasing trade between the two countries. * xurther example/4 i example of Germany’a new intereet in Kgypt hn&amp; been the bestowal of high German decorations not only upon Hahaa pasha, Makram Kbeid Pasha and members of their suite who accompanied them to Berlin, but also upon Madame ga&amp;hloul Pasha, who remains the dominant influence behind the Wafd. Another less striking but not unimportant example of German interest in Kgypt is, I venture to suggest, the fact that the two leading members of the German Davis Gup team, Baron von Kramra and Herr Henkel, have come to Cairo both this year and last year for the Egyptian Tennis Tournament, The rest of the entries, although good, are not of quite the same class and it eeems possible that these two players have been encouraged to visit Egypt with a view to carrying off the local chainpionship® and increasing the regard and admiration already felt in this country for German efficiency 4. As regards social relation® with Captain von Blomberg and his friends, they were very carefully looked after and given a warm welcome by Group Captain Bone, the Director General of Civil Aviation and also by my Air Force A.D.O, Flight Lieutenant Heber~Percy, who took part in the Rally. I myself entertained them at His Majesty’s Embassy and they were also entertained by the Boyal Air Force officers at Heliopolis during their short stay in Cairo, They made a very favourable impression on all who came in contact with them.

The Prime Minister said that this was not correct. As he had already informed me the Afghan Government had declined to consider the proposals for a German air service to Kabul and the Far East, until permission had been obtained by the Company or the German Government to operate the service across the intervening countries. He thought it possible that the information given by the agent of the Company at Baghdad to His Majesty’s Ambassador was based on the misapprehension that the leave granted last summer by the Afghan Government for a single experimental flight to Afghanistan was in fact a general permission for the company to operate their service in future across Afghanistan. 3. The Afghan Government had been careful to emphasise that the permis sion then given was for one flight only, and the fact that the German Charge d ’Affaires in Kabul had recently raised the question of permission for the 1 establishment of an air service to Kabul showed that the German Government themselves realised this fact. 4.

He said he considered that the Afghan Government, as an independent State, was entitled to grant or refuse permission to the air services of any other State to operate a line in Afghanistan. I agreed that this was the case and added that 1 had no idea at present what view His Majesty’s Government took of the matter. Speaking quite informally however I said that I knew that the Soviet Ambassador had recently expressed considerable misgivings at the present German penetration of Afghanistan, and that it seemed to me that the question now before the Afghan Government was not one of their sovereign rights but of expediency. The grant of permission for a German line to operate to Kabul would undoubtedly increase Soviet suspicions, and if the Soviet Government were then to ask for similar per mission and it was refused these suspicions would be further enhanced. 2. The Prime Minister replied that the question had not yet arisen. When it did he would consider it on its merits. In the meantime he had informed the German Government that they must first secure permission to cross Syria, Iraq and Iran before approaching the Afghan Government again. Would it not be possible for His Majesty’s Government to bring their considerable influence to bear on the Iraq Government and cause them to refuse permission to the German line to operate across Iraq ? This would solve the whole question. again reminded His Royal Highness that I was not in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Government in this matter, and any remarks I might make must be taken as an expression of my personal opinion, Prima facie however it seemed to me extremely unlikely that His Majesty’s Government even if they wished to do so, would be able to intervene in the manner suggested. So far as I knew there were three foreign lines now operating across Iraq, Imperial Airways, the K. L. Nl, and Air France, and it would be very difficult for His Majesty’s Government to suggest to the Iraq Government that, after having granted permission for these three lines they should then refuse permission to the Lufthanza line to cross their country, without assigning any very good reason for so doing. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India.

An interesting despatch. Colonel Fraser-Tytier The Gemans evidently take seriously their plans obtaining facilities in Sinkiang. There is always the possibility that they might operate a service as far as Kabul before the rest of the route was open. The younger members of the Afghan cabinet are bound to gain ground as time goes on and the Soviet danger continues to recede. We can be certain that sooner or later air services will operate in Afghanistan. We shall soon have to consider our attitude to a German service there. It might seem at first sight that we should react in the same way as we did to the possibility of a Soviet service, i.e. ask the Afghans for the option to start a Kaoul-India service if the German project goes through. But if, as seems most probable, the Germans cannot for a long time get further east than Kabul, the only possible use of a service to Kabul would be if it joined a service from there to India. Refusal to contemplate such a service would therefore be a good weapon against the German plan. ingeniously tried to kill two birds with one stone in paragraph 6 . for a service to the Far East in spite of the two tremendous difficulties of flying over the Pamir and m spite of the two ?

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a few days ago a report appeared in the local press to the effect that the Grerman Luft hansa woua.d shortly start operating an air service from Germany to China and that the machines would call at Basra 2. I caused enquiries to he made of Dwyer and Company, who were indicated as the agents for the Luft Hansa, and the manager, Colonel Dwyer, gave me the following information. There was he said, a good deal of truth in the report and it was the intention of the Luft Hansa to operate an air service from Germany to China carrying both mails and nassengers. The Germans had tried for several years to persuade the Turkish Government to allow a German air service to pass over Anatolia but they had so far failed to obtain conditions acceptable to them. More recently, the German Luft Hansa had decided to operate this Far Eastern service by way of Greece, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. The sanction of the Afghan Government was secured last August and two meteorological experts of the company had been for some time in Kabul. It was proposed to carry out a series of trial flights beginning in April and in all probability the German Luft Hansa would be operating towards China within the next few months. 3./ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.» M.P*&gt; etc., etc., etc.mmm )1 ULU^ mmm 3 . Colonel Dwyer added tnat Doctor Schacht was understood, during nis recent visit to Tenran, to have come to an understanding with the Iranian Government about this service; and from a different source I heard that the German Minister had applied to the Iraqi Government for permission for the Luft Hansa to operate through Iraq. 4 . I took a recent opportunity of asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Doctor Grobba had in fact approached him on the subject. Doctor Naji replied that he believed that such an application had been made but that the correspondence had not yet been laid before him. 5 .

G-erman aviation activities in Afghanistan.y0£iL (ICSRI* In view of the Afghan Prime Minister’s official visit to England this week, I think it might he as well to report the following side light on the German Aviation activities in AFGHANISTAN, in case that subject is touched upon in London. Starting about the middle of this month Captain von BL0N3ERG (son of the Minister for ¥ar) and Captain Baron SPECK vonSTERNBURG, both officers of the German Air Force, and an additional crew of three, are flying to KABUL via EGYPT, (where they take part in the international so called 'Oasis Rally') BAGHDAD &amp; TEHERAN, returning by BENDA-ABBAS, SONIRAS, BASRA, BAGHDAD, CYPRUS, RHODES, ATHENS, ISTANBUL, SOFIA, BUDAPEST &amp; VIENNA. They are flying in a JUNKERS 86, 2 engined (civil iyP e ) aeroplane, the bomber version of which is to be one of the new bomber types in Germany* This expensive flight is, of course, 'Bing financed by the German Government. These two young ofileers naturally regard the flight as a great adventure, and have heen entirely frank with me as to the details of their arrangements. But I have not a shadow of ^ouot tnat contacts will be made with the IRAQI&gt; the Ik-.h ana aRCMUK Governments, and that the flight is all part of a long distance policy both in its literal and its political sense. I have promised these officers personal introductions to one or two officers at HELIOPOLIS and BAGHDAD and I mean to write to Mr. Butler at TEHERAN, whom I happen to know. I would suggest that both from the point of view of politeness and in order to keep in close touch with the objects of their flight, we should give them a welcome m British circles wherever they go. Might /Might X suggest, therefore, that the British Diplomatic representatives in EGYPT, BAGHDAD, TEHERAN, KABUL &amp; perhaps, CYPRUS, should he notified of the intended ilignt and should be asked to show, unofficially, any hospitality possible to these officers. Bearing in mind that Captain von BLOMBERG is the son of head of the German Forces, their reception in private by British subjects en route will naturally be reported in high places on their return, and I am most anxious that they shall come back with good impressions: it will all help in our dealings here with the German ^ir Force. I should add that the Junkers 86 is being introduced i as an air traffic machine and that the officers are flying as private pilots, and I understand from the Passport Control Office that they have completed all the necessary Passport requirements.

Hempel the German pilot employed by the Afghan Government is an ex-officer of the German Air Force who fought on the Palestine front in the Great War, and was for some time a prisoner of war in Alexandria where he was well treated. After the Great 7far he was employed by the Lufthansa Company. He speaks some English. Herr Kempel and his mechanic have examined various aircraft belonging to the Afghan Air Force, and are cf the opinion that provided the necessary spares are obtained ^ from Europe several of the aircraft can be made serviceacxe enough for instructional purposes, and thus bring the total number of serviceable aircraft up to seven. Herr Hempei is also to act as a pilot instructor in the Afghan Air Force. (b) A second German mechanic is reported to have arrived in Kabul and is to work for the Afghan Government under Herr W. Hempel.

N — GERMAN FLIGHT to KARL/] . _ INTEREST IN EASTERN AIR LINES FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT BERLIN, Feb. 18 Two young German airmen, Captain von Sternburg and Captain von Blomberg (a son of the War Minister), have just left Berlin for Kabul by air. En route their aeroplane—a twin-engined Junkers 86 will take part in the Oasis rally near Cairo, proceeding thence via Baghdad and Teheran. . Their flight is a private enterprise but is perhaps symptomatic of the interest now being taken here in the development of a German air route to the Far Eas .

In the course of this reconnaissance the aeroplane is believed to have flown (presumably inadvertently) over part of Ghitral. It was understood that this trip was carried out with a view to exploring the possibilities of a service via the Middle East, Afghanistan and Sinkiang to the Par East* in which, it has been suggested, the Japanese would co-operate. In January 1937 a German pilot and a German mechanic arrived in Kabul; another German mechanic is to follow. They have been engaged by the Afghan Government to recondition a defunct Junker machine which has been in Kabul for years, and to Instruct in aviation. The Air Ministry nave copies of ail our papers on which the above information is based. There is no possibility of facilities of any sort for an air service being secured by the Germans in Sinkiang or Soviet territory. Indian territory bordering the Wakhan is pert of a prohibited zone, and it would not be possible to allow German planes or airships to fly over it. In any case, presumably, an air service over the Pamirs would be extremely hazardous, and, whether the service extended to the Par Sast or stopped short at Kabul, the revenue earned by it could never be expected to cover more than a fraction of its cost. These activities are. no doubt, part of the present German economic penetration in the Middle Kast. As yet, there is no sign that German commercial activities in Afghanistan /Afghanistan have political ends, bat the position is being closely watched. The history of projects for air^services in Afghanistan is a long one and the question important strategic and political aspects. Consequently, the attitude to be adopted by H.M.O. towards any scheme for a German service in Afghanistan - ii* (as would not be improbable) the Afghan Government should asic our advice - would require careful consideration in consultation with H.M.

Attitude of Hie Majesty's Government to this request* General policy of His Majesty 5 a Government is based on the desire for a friendly and stable Afghanisiaiio In military and air matters, fulfilment of this policy has hitherto taken the form of supply of war material on easy tarms and no effort has been made to influence the training of Afghan forces by the introduction of British instructors,, This is due to the following considerations: (1) a disinclination to take any steps which might disturb the Anglo^Afghan-Soviet relations; (2) realisation that F after the experience of past history, ar&amp; attitude of friendly detachment towards Afghan development would pay us better in the long run; (3) adverse conditions to which foreign employes in Afghanistan are subjected* Praaer Tytl er 119 i ?

His Majesty's Government are in a better position than I am to say whether this estimate is correct or note From local point of view Russians would probably prefer to see British instructor’s here than German or Italian. The presence of any foreign air instructors, save their own, in Kabul, might, however be antagonistic (sic, ? antagonize) Soviet Government further against present Afghan regime* (2) The present request suggests that policy-of detachment has been successful and that ? at any rate so far as present central Afghan Government axe concerned, we have lived down past history. In my opinion this tactor -n our policy has now lost great part of its force, though employment of British instructors may still give a handle to anfi^Government propaganda. (3) Conditions of life described in Katodon 37, still obtain, but are gradually becoming more tolerable, British employees of Marconi'' s working here under Afghan officials are reasonably satisfied with conditions, and personnel working (? under * omitted) general direction of Y/ar Minister and Air Commandant should b© we 11^ treated, * 6 &lt;&gt; My conclusions are that active assistance in training Afghan forces in Afghanistan would further oui general policy towards the Afghan Government, provided that granv of such assistance does not unduly upset the Soviet Government. Fraser~Tytier 119, Deoe mb er 22 nd vivrAs regards the request now under* consideration? the following points appear of importance: 'Refusal would hardly seem consistent with His Majesty 9 is Government 9 s request already made that the Afghan Government should base their air force mainly on British sourcesa (2) Acceptance would appear' to involve acceptance of scheme for training Afghan personnel in India* unless the present request is intended to replace the former one* (3) Refusal would probably mean the engagement of German or Italian personnel* 3* If His Majesty 7 s Government decide to accede to the request* the following points arises. a Cost of personnel would probably? though not certainly* be too high for the Afghan Government.

No. 106, dated the 1st (eeceived In the Military Attache’s Summary No. 28, dated the llth July 1936 paragraph 3 reference is made to the visit to Kabul of a German aeroplane! The German Minister and his wife, accompanied by the officer in charge of the aeroplane and the second pilot lunched at His Majesty’s Legation on July 2oth. The following particulars regarding this visit, gleaned from them and irom a subsequent conversation with the Foreign Minister appear to be of sufficient interest to form the subject of a separate report. 2. The plane is a three engined low winged monoplane with accommodation for ten passengers of the type usually employed on the Lufthanza passenger service. It has a flying speed of about 240 kilometres per hour, and a ‘ ceiling ’ of about 20,000 feet. 3. The outward voyage was made by Bucharest, Stamboul and Teheran and the plane arrived in Kabul on July 8th. It left on July 30th on its home ward journey which I understand is to be made by Teheran, Aleppo and Rhodes. 4. During its stay a number of flights were made in the vicinity of Kabul during which meteorological observations were taken and one morning members of the diplomatic corps and their families were kindly invited to the aerodrome by Dr. Ziemke and given short flights in the machine. A flight was also made to Kandahar and back with a number of Afghan officials as well as Dr. and Mrs. Ziemke on board. The most interesting incident of the visit and apparently its main object was a reconnaissance north eastwards from Kabul. The plane traversed the lower ranges of Nuristan and crossed the Hindu Kush by the Munjan Pass. It then continued north eastwards till it reached the Oxus near Zebak. A course was then laid up the valley of Wakhan, following the upper waters of the Oxus, and an attempt made to cross the Little Pamir. At a height of 19 000 feet the observers -were able to look down into Chinese Turkestan, but it appears that they did not consider that their machine had enough ‘ ceiling ’ to continue the flight further, and so turned back, possibly stopping at Khan a bad to refuel. 5. The Afghan Foreign Minister said that the flight was a reconnaissance made with a view to finding out whether it would be possible to establish a through service from Germany to China by this route. Permission for ,he reconnaissance had been given by the Afghan ^velnme'nt Were for Turkey, Iraq and Iran had been obtained. The Afghan Go\( in not, however, committed to the establishment of \ se /Y 1CE A't ifbrthe Goman would consider the question after arrangements had been made by the mrma Government with the aforementioned countries. « Th. officer in « « Majesty’s Minister, Teheran as No. b.

Similar letter sent to 14—6130 13241 ( 2 )(£ 4816/518/65) O.A 74 Pear Pacjy, A G-erman 3-engined junkers oommeroial aeroplane arrived in Tehran on June 30th and left for Afghanistan after a week’s stay. The local press reported that the object of the visit was the study of meteorlogical conditions. 2. The Japanese Minister told Simmonds that he thought the German plane was studying conditions for an eventual service between Berlin and Urumchi via Ankara, Baghdad, Tehran and Kabul. At Urumchi connection would be made with a further service to Shanghai. He said the Germans had been granted by the Chinese Government the concession for an air service from Europe to China, but the soviets had refused to allow the German service to operate over soviet territory. The proposed route was interesting from a political and propaganda viewpoint, but was unlikely to be remunerative. 3. Pybus has heard a similar story from the French miitary Attach^, so there may be something in it. Walker agrees too that the Germans are probably wanting to run an air service through here and that the present trip is in the nature of a meteorological survey; but he has no information as to the proposed route after Kabul. 4. Whether the Germans have obtained permission to operate across Iran, and to what extent the proposed service would compete/ H.L. Baggallay Esquire, The Foreign Office*compete with the projected Iranian civil air service to Baghdad, are questions which we cannot yet answer* 5.

The file contains correspondence, extracts from intelligence summaries, memoranda, and notes documenting the efforts of British officials to oppose the establishment of a German airline in Afghanistan, and the operation of an air route through Central Asia between the territories of the Soviet Union and British India. This includes detailed policy discussion between the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, and the India Office over whether to grant Lufthansa transit rights across India and Burma in order to induce the company to move away from the Central Asian route. Details of experimental flights between Berlin and Kabul are also recorded in the file; a sketch map illustrating the route of a German reconnaissance flight July 1936 between Kabul and Wakhan may be found on folio 612v.Additional correspondence is largely with William Kerr Fraser-Tytler, HM Minister at Kabul. However, there is also a small amount of correspondence with the Governments of Burma and India, and – largely in the form of circulars – British diplomatic representatives at Athens, Cairo, Baghdad, Tehran, Bangkok, and Peking. The file also includes a few letters between the Air Ministry and Herr Fisch, Germany's Aviation Minister, regarding Lufthansa's application for transit rights across India and Burma.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Deutsche Luft Hansa</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kabul</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00021e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
