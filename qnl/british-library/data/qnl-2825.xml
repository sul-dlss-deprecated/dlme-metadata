The Government of India would be glad to know what the explanation of these increased exports is and whether there are grounds for suspicion that any of the tea may be intended for the enemy. 4.

So far as Bahrain is concerned there seems to be some last enclosure to Government of India letter No. D.1012-N/40 dated the 3th March 1940. I am informed by the Director of Customs and port Officer in Bahrain that between April 1938 and October 1939, 5489 cases of tea, equivalent to 6,14,768 lbs., were imported here; whereas from the 1st November 1939 to the 31st January 1940 imports totalled 299 cases equivalent to 33,488 lbs. From these figures it is apparent that the rate of import actually decreased in recent months, and it is indeed reported that for some time after the outbreak of war there was a drop in the imports of tea into Bahrain owing to speculation in India, though they are now normal. 3. As for the Trucial Coast ports it is believed that the export of tea from these ports to Iran has increased by about 30# since the outbreak of war. On the average about 4000 lbs. are exported from Dubai and Sharjah monthly mistake in the figures shown in statements I td II in the while /Ydiile a small quantity Is smuggled into that country by passengers and crews of sailing craft. Tea carried openly into Iran from the Trucial Coast ports generally goes to Bandar Abbas whence, it is understood, it is forwarded to Kerman, Isfahan and Tehran.

The Middle East Supply Centre have evidence which indicates that large quantities of tea are finding their way from India into enemy territory via Syria. It has been suggested that the Persian Gulf route is being used and I have been asked to investigate this suggestion in relation to Bahrain and the Trucial Coast. 3. In regard to Bahrain there are certain figures which I find puzzling and I shall be glad of your assistance dated the 24th April i940)• From April 1940 to October 1941 imports of tea into Bahrain were 5214 cases (vide your memorandum No.SOl^SF, dated the 2nd March 1942). It seems, therefore, that up to the end of October 1941 imports have been normal i.e. averaging approximately 300 cases per month. Between 1st November 1941 and 31st January 1942, however, no less than 1478 cases of tea were imported into A* ?£ Bahrain (vide your memorandum under reference 1 as against 299 cases imported between 1st November 1939 and 31st Jan uary 1940. Figures of imports between 1st November 1939 and 31st January 1940 are not a sound criterion since that in elucidating them 4. Imports of tea into Bahrain from April 1938 to October 1939 were 5489 cases (vide your memorandum No.442/3 / periodHiamMiMib -* ml / &gt; - 2 - pericxi was a disturbed one following immediately on the out break of war. The fact remains however that.,whereas average imports of tea into Bahrain are approximately 300 cases per month*imports for the period of three months from 1st November 1941 to 31st January 1942 are 493 cases; per month. 5. Since imports of tea up to the end of October 1941 were normal and, from the beginning of November 1941 to the end of January 1942, were greatly above normal one would ex pect to find that stocks of tea in Bahrain at the end of Jan uary were very much larger than they had been 3 months earlier. Statistics available to me do not fulfil this expectation. In fiu h*'/(4 ( * the Food Controller's memorandum No.PA/PC/239/60, dated the 6th October 1941 stocks of tea in Bahrain are shown as being 6 months* supply (i.e. about 1500 cases). The corresponding statement sent in the Food Controller's memorandum No.PA/FC/ 312/- 60, dated the 27th November 1941 again shows stocks of tea at the level of 5 months' supply. In the Food Controller's report /• ^ 9 'Jli- ''/v* | NO•PA/FC/37/61, dated the 31st January 1942 stocks of tea are shown as being 1200 cases (i.e. about 4 months' supply). T he point that I find it difficult to understand is how stocks of tea in Bahrain between the end of October 1941 and the end of January 1942 declined when imports were very considerably above normal. From these figures it looks as though there had been a considerable leakage of tea, amounting to between 500 and 600 cases, from Bahrain between the end of October 1941 and the end of January 1942. I shall be grateful if you can throw any light on the subject with particular reference to the question whether tea nominally imported for consumption in Bahrain is being re-exported by routes leading eventually to enemy territory.

One merchant informed me that large consignments tof tea recently sanctioned for export to Ganaweh were really taken to Basra and that if we ascertain from the Suetome office the names of the nakhudas and dhows by which the tea was consigned and make enquiries from Basra regarding the same nakhudas and dhows we shall be able to confirm this* 3* The other merchant informed me that tea and other goods for Persia always hare to be consigned to the smaller Persian ports ifcere no endorsement by the local customs authorities on shipping bills is required* The Butfiire customs authorities refuse to endorse any shipping bills from Bahrain owing to the Persian claim to soyerelgnty* 4* I hare been Informed that the export of tea from Bahrain has recently been totally prohibited* 5* Tea is the national drink of Persia and if there is any surplus in the Gulf ports there is no harm in letting it go to Persia prorided it is genuinely Intended for that country* With regard to Iraq I am not quite sure what the situation is but X bellere tea fetches a high price now there and probably a certain amount is generally required for local needs* It is necessary, however, carefully to watch the amount of tea sent to Iraq in case it may be sent to the enemy via Turkey* (i ltd.

It is also not a tated to what extent if any we are to be guided by them. 3. A large consignment of tea has just reached Dubai and there are considerable stocks in Bahrain. The local consumption is small and most of it is intended for re-export to Persia or Iraq. 4. To what extent should such re-export be discouraged ? In Bahrain there would be little difficulty about prohibiting it — in fact such a prohibition has recently been announced - and pressure could also be brought to bear on the tfhaikh of Dubai though he would be reluctant to take action as the prosperity of his State is dependent on its trade with Persia. So far as the local situation is concerned I am in favour of permitting re-export provided precautions are taken to conserve sufficient ^ stocks for local needs. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Wakefield and Hickinbotham. If there is no objection would you kindly send them copies of your reply. H.

(58)/42, dated the 3lst July there will be no further exports of tea to Persia this year, a more than sufficient quantity having already been exported. The export of Tea to Iraq, has also been made subject to quota, it is therefore desirable that the re-export of tea from Bahrain to Iraq and to Persia should,if possible, be prohibited. 3. Since Dubai depends largely for its prosperity on the entrepot trade it will presumably not be prac ticable or advisable to attempt to prevent the re-export of tea altbgether, but so far as possible the dimensions of the trade in the re-export of tea should be restricted. It will be appreciated that the more tea that is re-export ed from the Persian Gulf Ports the less there will be for the needs of Arabia arid the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms. P.O.

The re-export of tea from Bahrain and the Truclal Coast to Iraq or Persia is not at present generally prohibited, but in both these areas re-export is only permitted in respect of quantities surplus to local requirements for a period of six months. Since tea stored in the Gulf deteriorates after a period of six months, it would be false economy to keep in reserve more than six months* requirements. Tdoreover, tea is almost the sole remaining commodity which can be purchased on the Arab side of the Gulf by Persians bringing over meat, potatoes, or dates smuggled out of Iraq. If the re-export of tea were prohibited, Persians would cease to bring over meat, etc. (since they could take nothing back in exchange) and the food situation in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast would become even more desperate than it already is.

We are sole distributors for Brooke bond's Tea in Bahrain and it is over twenty years we have been importing the same ana selling retail and wholesal in the market, bince the last two years our suppliers have not been able to ship us any tea as all their products have' been requisione d by the government for military purposes. Incidentally after some tine our stocks got finished and it put our customers to great hardship and inconvenience to buy tea from the market. We therefore started buying tea from the market &lt;_ no supplied our customers and since the rationing system came in force we have been applying to the Fo^d untroller for our requirements and were getting a few cases every month for retail sale in our shop. ihe quantity of tea that the Food Controller allowed us was far less than our requirements but somehow we carried on and satisfied our clients. However now as we have finished all our previous stock of tea and coffee and moreover getting of tea from the market has become very difficult and cumoersome all our customers come to us ana request^ ^ us to oblige them by getting them the tea required. We require about five cases of tea of best quality each case weighing about 60 to 70 lbs every month for retail sale in the shop. We assure you that we will sell only to our bonafide and regular customers and we will not sell more than one pound at a time to an individual or family. Moreover if you wish we wil^ keep a register showing names and date and quantity of tea supplied to each customer, so that no one can make misuse of tea purchased from our stores. We wish to take upon ourselves the bother of selling tea in order to KHuvKisHSK afford convenience and facilities to our customers and we trust you will kindly grant us the favour we have asked for and oblige.

During current coffee season,' 1616 tons coffee were released by Indian Coffee Board for export to Persian Gulf but separate allotments were not made for each destination in Gulf. According to their contract with Indian Coffee Board, exporters are free to itip this coffee to any destination and it is not possible to force them to divert any portion to Bahrain. However exporters who have still some unexported balances are now being requested to sell some to Bahrain.) 3. For future, it is suggested that one of the following procedures be aoopted for inport of coffee from India: (a) Merchants may apply direct to Indian Ccffee Board, Bangalore through you for their requirements. In this case you will be responsible to Board for payment of coffee bought. . - v or (b) Merchants may get into touch with any of the established shippers of coffee as per list attached. Exporters will, in their turn, buy coffee from Indian Coffee Board and make their own arrangements for shipping. Alternative (a) should however be adopted.only if there is genuine difficulty experienced in obtaining coffee. Otherwise ordinary channels of trade should be used. Orders for release of coffee during next coffee season should be placed before October 1943^. 4. Monthly quotas now in force, which include re-export quotas for Saudi Arabia in case of Bahrain and Kuweit, were fixed on basis of estimates of requirements furnished by Political Resident in May 1942 (viie his telegrams Nos.T/401 and 1/472 dated 1st and 9ThMay 1942).

The sugar figures have accordingly been placed as low as possible in relation to t^e ten figures^ ^tirther reduction of then f* impossible for obvious reasons. (Bahraini exports of sugar to Persia, when she has had sufficient for re-export, were eight times the quantity of her exports of tea). The purchasing power of a ton of tea is approxima tely eight times that of a ton of su ar. Therefore, if any reduction is to nirde in the amounts of tea applied for, the amounts of ■agar should be Increased according So that ratio, subject to a alnlraua of 10 tons of tea for » tons for the Trucial Coast. 4. The above figures are coinpi following present values of monthly imports of essential eofirioditlss required from Persia i- &gt; Bahrain Its 1,15,000 \ Trucial Coast fc 1,50,000 S ( omenta on these figures follow. 5. It will perhaps be noticed, from the Trade Report figures which hove been supplied to you up to and including the year 1941-42, that the present monthly value of Bahrain’s imports from Rersis considerably exceeds the average monthly value of her imports prior to the spring of 1942. The reasons are threefold«-- 2 - (a) Tha export from Persia of moot, if not all, of the commodi ties in question is officially prohibited, and they have in conse quence to be smuggled out of the country by enterprising nakhudas, who are enticed by the prospect of high prices in Bahrain and the acquisition of goods from Bahrain in exchange* As a result, prices of these commodities have increased enormously since the spring of 0 (b) In the case of certain essential commodities, such as char coal and firewood, of which previously only a small proportion of Bahrain's requirements used to come from Persia, that country has now become our principal, if not the only, exporter, owinr to res trictions placed on theirncport by other countries which used to be e our chief suppliers. (c) A very considerable increase in Bahrain's requirements of meat on the hoof, poultry and cattle, all of which come exclusively from Persia, is necessitated by the greatly increased number of passengers by air who will henceforth be given meals at Bahrain on their way through. The first stage of the expansion of the B.O.A.C'g services has alrsady taken place, some ten days ago; further stages ars likely to follow in quick succession, with a likelihood of a con siderable number of regular night stops at Bahrain by the end of 6. Sharjah is not likely to be affected to anything like the same degree as Bahrain by the consideration at(c) in the previous para graph. The considerations at (a) and (b), however, apply also to the Trucial Coast and r atar with the exception that in their case the majority of the trade with Persia is carried on, not by Persian nakhudas but by Bubal and Sharjah merchants. On the of Trucial Coast by far tha most important import from Peraja afceeently las been dates. Although in the Trucial Coast's monthly statements of imports from -1941 both Iraq and Kuwait were shown as having supplied, in the aggregate, more dates to the Trucial Coast than from Persia, I understand from the Fesidency Agent, Sharjah, (who made enquiries in the matter during his recent visit to Kuwait and /-\V&gt;M 3 and Basra) that a large proportion of the dates shown as having been Imported from Iraq to Kuwait originated In actual fact from the Persian territory on the 3hatt-al-s\rab y but were declared as Iraqi dates on account of the export restrictions Imposed In Persia, For all Persian dates, whether brought to the Trudal Coast direct frfem Persia or via Iraq It la essential that sugar and tea should be available In exchange (now that plecegoods can no longer be available) for It Is only by being allowed to export theee commodities In exchange for the dates that they import that Dubai and Sharjah merchants are Induced to go to the trouble at a price low enough — sometimes lower. In fact, than the prices at which they bought them,— for the Indigent Inhabitants of the iruelal Coast to afford. It la, of course, hoped that the Persian r ?ulf Sheikhdoms will be enabled to pure ha ae Iraqi dates from the currant crop through Andrew v?elr * Co«, more cheaply than Iraqi or Persian dates have been bought In the past,(reference correspondence resting with India office telegram Ho, 16612, dated the 26th Jhly 1943,) but there le no guarantee that the whole of the Truclal Coast's and star's yearly requirements of 8000 tons can be supplied by Andrew Weir, In computing the figure of fe 1,50,000 given In paragraph 4 above, I have allowed for an average of 250 tons of dates per month from Persia, out of a total estimate. This figure and the figures In paragraph 2 will, of course, Increase If the M,E,S,C, are unable to produce the balance 7m The Government of India have enquired about the possibility of the Truela1 coast obtaining Its requirements of dates from Muscat, This Is Impossible as, to the best of my knowledge, Muscat has no surplus dates for export, (The small quantity which Is annually sxported from Wisest to ths Truclal Coast is from date gardens in 'fuscat territory owned by Inhabitants of the Trucial Coast, and is off-set by small exports from Dubai to Muscat), A reference In this connection la Invited to paragraph 132 of the ?*U8cat Intelligence Summary Ho, 12 of 1943, Gven If &lt;*v which does not seem an excessive fttaA't'toWI* A'rrxvr't. fWv* bacat to the Truclal CoDstin any quantity 9 the Truclal Coast would have no means of paying for thornj furthermore the price of **uscat dates was very high last yearand the same is probably the case this year* 8* In conclusion I must emphasise that the figures given in paragraph 2 above are minfoifn essential figures and are not capable of further reduction* (I have myself reduced by nearly 60 per cent the figures supplied to me by the Residency Agent)* Unless the plaee formerly held by plecegoods as the chief article of barter with Persia can be taken by sugar and tea in adequate quantities the results will be disastrous for the economic life both of Bahrain and of the Truclal Coast* It will also mean, incidentally, that it will not be possible for local supplies of meat, milk, butter and eggs to be made available for passengers on the B*C*A*C* flying boats and that tinned supplies, much of them no doubt from India, will have to be brought here in their place* If adequate Inducements are given to the Persian nakhudas, they will bring us our essential supplies* If not, they will take them elsewhere* The question of whether there are alternative commodities suitable for barter with Persia, which might be more readily available from India, has been examined, but it is only for sugar and tsa, in addition to plecegoods, that there is a per manent demand in Persia and therefore a regular quota of these two commodities Is essential* 9* I apologise for the length of this letter, but T have noted the Government of India's request, in paragraph 4 of their express letter No* 5868-N/43, dated the 9th August 1943, for any information on the organisation of economic life in the Sheikhdoms • 3d/- V* G.

Subject : Imports of piece-goods and tea . MEMORANDUM. Considerable dissatisfaction is felt locally at the system, or lack of system, emx^loyed by the authorities in Bombay in issuing export perndts for piece-goods. Up to August 1943 we sent monthly Loading Programmes recommending a certain tonnage for each of our merchants, but the authori ties never complied with these Programmes; and some Sharjah merchants who bought piece-goods many months ago on the strength of our recommendations have been unable to import them yet. Lately Dubai merchants have v een unable to get export licences but a Basravi, Abdullr Ahmed Zunaidi, has just t-ianag d to import 52 bales of piece-goods to Dubai and 56 to Qatar. 2. If India would agree to issue licences in accordance with our recommendations as is being done in the case of tea, everybody would be satisfied, and the merchants would''settle among themselves what proportion of imports each was to' have. It would then be possible for us to put into operation some such scheme as that in force in Bahrain whereby one third of the imported piece-goods are taken over and sold at a controlled price to the poor. This is a matter of real urgency as the price of piece-goods is now 200 to 300 % higher here than in India, it would be difficult to institute this scheme at present as we have no hold over the merchants and it is possible that they would start importing to other coast towns instead of to Dubai or Sharjah. 3. With regard to the question of tea, merchants have represented to me that they have been refused their April- August quota in India because they could produce no 'licence' from the Political Agent. They state that Bahrain merchants have received their quotas as they had each a separate 'licence' from the Political Agent.

Thus th. four months March, April, May, and Jun. 1942 should b. added. During th.s. four months 3,515 bags of coff.. w.r. imnort.d.

At my request the Director of Customs examined the import figures for the years 1939-40 and 1940-41 and informed me on the 5th of December 1943 that the average annual imports for Saudi Arabia for these two years were approximately 600 tons. I acceptec this figure and did not personally check the figures for 1941-42 which formed a somewhat unsatisfactory basis for my predecessor's estimate of our requirements for Saudi Arabia. Assuming the Director of Custom's figures to be correct for 1939-40 and 1940-41 and taking an average for these two years with the figures for the complete twelve months of 1941-42 we get the figure 474 tons as ti average annual imports for the 3 years.4.

The position is as follows :- The Tea Conipollei* pj?esuinably gave Aii Reza^s preoentative in India permission to purchase 500 cases of a, as they are one of the mercnants who import for Saudi f-bia via Banrain# The Tea Controller, when he gave this rmission, was not aware that quotas are allotted by Jr'.A* ahrain, vide p.2ib. Re te Ar p4 B , A i Rezd. states tnat tne tea which was bought lor export coc.ts more than that used for consumption in iriaia, and so he cannot sell this amount in India. He wants a letter addressed to the Tea Controller stating that r.iw Ec.nrciin lias no objection to the amount being imported into Saudi Arabia. This is obviously impossible as the Tea Con- t^oller has been advised by us that exports should be made strictly in accordance with our quota allotments. Ali Reza may be given some kind of compensation, e.g. As he is the only merchant who appears to have suffered by the Tea Controller*s being unaware of our quota allotments, lls n ^ me onl y nia y mentioned in our fist until his 500 cases nave been shipped. This would take 5 months. The other inporters may raise an objection but we may strike out Reza*a name irom the list for a corresponding period after the 500 cases have, been shipped. obt to su Ali Reza appears to be desperately anxious to am any kind of assistance in this matter. He is coming morrow and may be asked whether he agrees to the above ■ggestion ?</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/767</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/767</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 29/18i I Food Supplies – TEA &amp; COFFEE’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-10-23T21:12:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (372 folios)</extent><extent>Files papers are arranged more or less chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the back cover with 374; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

Letters, telegrams and memoranda are exchanged mainly between the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and also between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent, Bahrain and several Government of India officials, particularly the Tea Controller for India, the Export Trade and Foreign Trade Controllers in Bombay and Calcutta and other officials, mainly in the Departments of Commerce and External Affairs.The file contains numerous supply and trade statistics, mainly for tea, and in particular the regular lists compiled by the Director of Customs and Port Officer for Bahrain, acting in his wartime capacity as the Food Controller, Bahrain. His lists show the monthly distribution of licenses for the export of tea quotas, and to a lesser extent coffee, from India to Bahrain, together with the names of the Bombay exporters and the Bahrain importers for each consignment. Throughout the correspondence, British officials discuss their several enquiries into Indian tea exports to Arab countries that they suspect are re-exported or smuggled into Germany and other enemy countries. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf also raises his concerns about the potential impact of Government of India export controls on the economy of the Arab Gulf States and shaikhdoms if he should strictly enforce them, since they would inhibit normal trade with Iran (Persia) in essential commodities subject to severe wartime shortages, such as fresh food and firewood. The file also includes numerous letters exchanged between Bahrain importers, Indian exporters and the Political Agent, Bahrain about shipments of tea and other commodities to Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Food Controller</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Coffee</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food resources</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tea</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
