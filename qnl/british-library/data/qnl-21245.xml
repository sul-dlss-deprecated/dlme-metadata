AI'R HEADQUARTERS, 'IRAQ GO Tor AND, HINAI 7 )! • m/R. 11080. 8th November, 1933. jiy dear Ludlow, With reference to your message of the 19th October, I enclose herewith two sKetch maps, one of Muharraq. Island (marked No« 2) and one of the Northern portion of Bahrein Island (marked No. 1), on which I have marked out the proposed reserved areas for future R.A.P. requirements. The maps have been prepared from mosaic photographs and while every precaution has been taken to ensure that the scale is accurate, yet I would point out that no survey has been carried out of the Bahrein Islands and therefore the sketch maps cannot be accurate to the nearest yard. 2, My choice of these reserve-d areas has been influenced by the following points. MANAMA. Requirements for a seaplane base. 3, The Chief Engineer of this command estimates that the minimum area required for a seaplane base accommodating one squadron is approximately 6R acres and it is thought advis able to have as much foreshore as possible consistent with a reasonable depth. It appears to me, therefore, that an area of approximately 800 yards by 400 yards should meet the case. Reasons for proposed location. 4. On reference to sketch map No. 1 you will notice that the area I have reserved is not on the site of the present Rest House and Pier but is some 400 yards to the South of this. My reasons for selecting this particular site are ; (a) The ground around the Rest House has several valuable properties on it. I cannot ascertain at the moment the precise ownership of these without having reference to the Bahrein Government, but 1 understand from tiie Political Agent that the properties belong to various private Arab persons. There can^be no doubt that the negotiation for the lease of land on which are these properties would be a difficult, lengthly and expensive business. I am informed by G-roup Captain Welsh that there are no practical difficulties in moving the seaplane anchorage some 500 yards to the South. On reference to /Admiralty VICE-MARSHAL SIR EDGAR R. LinLO^-HEWITT, K.C.B., G.M.G,, D.S.O., M.C., AIR MINISTRY, AD ASTRAL HOUSE, KING-STAY, W.C.2.( 2 ) nf n I J Admiralty Chart No. 20 (Bahrein Harbour) also to the mosaic photographs forwarded under cover of my ^.o, letter to G-rour) Captain Harris No. 'D.0./S. 11080 of the 14th October, 1955, it will be seen that a reef of rock runs under water at a distance of approximately a quarter of a mile out to sea opposite the existing Rest House; this v is approximately the length of the present pier. This reef iuts further out to sea as one proceeds further South. For this reason it is important that the nortnernmost boundary as shown on the map is adhered to as far as possible otherwise the new pier, which will be required in any case, will have to be considerably longer than the present temporary erection. / c ) The site I have chosen has no properties on it whatsoever, has equally good hard sand as around the present Rest House and has the advantage that it can be f i extended further to the South if necessary; also it lies adjacent to the aerodrome site of Manama which no doubt would be very useful for communication purposes. 5 # I do not know at present whether this reserved site is owned by the Bahrein Government or by private individuals but I think that there should be no difficulty in our acquiring this land provided action is not too long delayed. l\ MUHARRAQ. Requirements for a landplane squadron base# 6, The Chief Engineer estimates that the minimum area required for a landplane squadron base is approximately 62 acres for buildings, etc. and approximately 1000 yards square for the aerodrome. Reasons for proposed location. 7. I have come to the conclusion that irwiew of the ultimate development of the Air Route and also possiole future service requirements it would be most advisable for the R.A.P. aerodrome to be entirely separate from the civilian aerodrom^e. There is a large area of good hard sand of the same nature as the present aerodrome which lies where I have marked out our reserved area on map No. 2. My reasons for choosing this location are (a) In a Gulf Port such as Bahrein it is highly advisable that the living quarters of any personnel who may be stationed there should be situated on tne sea front facing the prevailing wind in order to get reasonable comfort during the very trying Summer months. It is also advisable to have the aerodrome in such a position that dust blown up by aeroplanes is not blown back on living quarters, etc. (b) The proposed site is in easy access to the causeway connecting the two islands which I hope will be completed in the future. (c) There are no properties of any sort on this area. I understand it is not subject to flooding. /(d)( 3 ) (d) Very little work will bereqaired to make^an ,. i\ * h ! aerodrome of 1000 yards 'by 1000 yards with an equally good surface as the existing Muharraq. aerodrome. q Colonel J.E» Ohippindall, R.S», tue Oaief^ ffno-ineer will be visiting Bahrein at the end or this weeK oi 1 the beginning of next and I have given him instructions to carry cut a reconnaissance of this site from the point oi view oi giving good foundations for Dnildings* etc# j do not at present know who owns this land but think that it is the property of the Sheikh and I do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring a permanent lease for this although in our former agreement with the Sheikh he stimulated that we should not build an aerodrome within a mile of Muharraq town, and you will notice that the oouth ^Test side of this area is from 1300 - 1600 yards from the town. However, this should allow ample room for any future expansion of Muharraq town. 10. If negotiations for the acquiring of the Muharraq site are commenced with the Bahrein Government a clause should be inserted to ensure that high buildings, such as derricks, etc. , may not be erected close to the aerodrome boundaries without our permission.

Dear McClaughry, t: ' ^ ivfeny thanks for your letter of the 18th Novemtier, No# 3»3144:«5/pt« II* I Quite s^^ree tii8 ,t the Air Iviinistry are entirely uncorumitted at this stage as regards the purchase of any supplementary areas for the purpose of landing ground or seaplane bases in Bahrein, \ an d that throughout the discussions which have taken place between us on the subject it has been clearly understood that the whole matter was one which must form the subject of discussion once the A.O.C. f s detailed recommendations had been received and that no decision of any sort could be taken or suggested until that discussion haa taken pl^ce. 2. Your letter rather suggests, however, that the Air Ministry may feed reluctant to engage in expenditure for the purpose of acquiring additional land as an insurance against the future at Bahrein. That is, of course, essentially a matter for them, and if they are satisfied, after considering the A.CUC.'s report, that Commander W.A. IVicClaughry, D30., IvlC., DFG., their/ Air Ministry, Adastral House, King sway, W.C.2.their requlreiTients over the long period during which tho Rahrein petroleum Company's mining lease may operate tne cam Oj, will he met/we have nothing more to say. My sole object in raising this point originally was to draw attention to the fact that the lease if taken out would run for a period of 5£&gt; years and that, with the pro'ca'ole development of air conmunications during that period and the accepted importance of Bahrein as cl - linK in the air route to the East, you might think some special precautions necGssary. 3 # i should like, however, pending detailed examination of the A.O.C.'s recommendation to draw attention to the following points, which perhaps you would 'bear in mind. The first is that it is arguable that the Company might contend that such undertakings as they have given cannot reasonably he construed as extending to sites not in our possession and in respect of which we are only in a position to say that at some time during the currency of the mining lease we may wish to acquire them. The correspondence which has passed between us ana the Company(and the Eastern ana General Syndicate) in respect of safeguards for landing grounds and seaplane bases in Bahrein is sumnarised. in my letter of 89th September last, No. P.Z.6219/33, to Seal, of ^ -which/which- copies wsre sent 'to Turner at the Air Iva .nist.ry as well as to the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, India and Bushire. My second point Is that even if we assume that the Company are prepared to agree that the undertakings given by them extend to any areas which we may now mark out for landing ground and seaplane bases, even if these areas are not in our possession, it will inevitably become known sooner or later (anu prooahly in the very near future) that we have or may have the Intention of acquiring those areas for Government purposes. Will not the effect of this be to raise the price against us very suostantially li we wish to acquire at a future date? I am at your disposal if the Air Ministry wish. to talk matters over further, ana in the event of the Air Ministry, with Treasury approval, desiring to make further purchases of land, we shall, of course, oe very glad to send any necessary instructions to the Political Resident. 5. if you see no objection I should like to send copies of this letter to the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department, as they are all indirectly interested in the position. In that event, perhaps you would/„&gt; b CONFIDENTIAL. ^■ 0# C/Z2, of 1934.

In the meantime we are preparing a paper on the subject. I enclose herewith for your information copies of sketches received from A.C.G.Iraq, in which he indicates the extra land he suggests should be acquired by us. We woibld be grateful if you ootid obtain from Fowle as soon as possible an estimate af the cost of purchase of that lana. With reference to paragraph 5 of your ahove- quoted letter, we agree that copies of relevant correspondence should be sent to the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department, ana I will take the necessary action in so far as v.e are concerned. Yours sincerely, sd. W.A.McClaughry. J.G.Laithwaite Ssq., Inaia Office, S.W.Ou(jOfemment are purchasers until transaction is complete. Purchase should be in name of His Majesty^ GoTernment and not of any individual department. Its object can informally be stated as Air Force requirements. It is of course most important not to give any indication that Admiralty are at all interested. (3). Air Ministry suggest that you should keep m close touch with A(ir) O(fficer) C(ommancLing), Ura^,regarding any difficulties which may arise (group mutilated Torer?) land occupied by Persians so as to ensure that any failure to acquire land occupied by them does not ruin remainder site.

Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to Treasury letter of the 21st Beoeiaber, S.3467S/S forwarding a copy o.. a letter to the Admiralty on the subject ox the purchase of land at Bahrein and to acquaint you for the infomation of the Lords Gomiais si oners of His Majesty's Treasury that they are nov .i„ a position to formulate proposals for the acquisition of Ic^xd in Bahrein for Air Force purposes. These proposals ^ like those &gt;.l the ..dniiralt j, are not designed to meet an immediate requirement but represent, in the: Council 's view, a prudent measure of insurance .gainst the uncertainties of the future, uased upon . forecast of orobeltle deyelopments during the currency oi tne mining lease which i- .e Banrein Petroleuxa Comp; n^ are expected ' go tahe up. Apart, therefore, from the cost or purcnasinj the lan^ the Council do not at present contemplate any expenditure upon its development for Air Force purposes. bd.sting Air Force requirements at Bahrein are confined to the maintenance of the strategic air route turoujn the Persian Gulf and are met by the lease of a landing ground at Manama on the Island of Bahrein and the maintenance in the proximity of this landing ground oi mo or in, and a temporary pier for the use of fl^i.x boats, fhe landin ; ground is, however, of small dimensions and as tne cost of renderi^ it suitable for use by the h rger and heavier types oi aircraft is regarded as excessive, such aircraft are at present compelled to use the landing ground on Muharraq Island, which is be in;, leased lor use by Imperial Airways. It would, hoY /ever, be rash to prophesy that Air Force Secretary. . require^ e. .ts hn/ . ,.1.2. requirements at Bahrein during the next fifty years will be confined to the luaintenanoe of the strategic -.air route, or, even if they were so confined, that they could be met 'by the facilities now available. The Air Council have accordingly considered it prudent to envisage the possible need for establishing a flying boat base on the Island of Baarein and an aerodrome on iaiaarraq Island, the use of which could be confined to service aircraft. Sites for both these requirements have been selected 'by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, as indicated on the attached plan and an estimate of the cost of their acquisition obtained from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, vide the attached copy of a telegram to the India Office. 'The estimated cost of acquiring the areas selected, 72,000 Rupees for the Seaplane Base, and 65,000 Rupees for the aerodrome, is somewhat higher than the Air Council had anticipated but as it appears certain that the land will increase in value, they have no hesitation in recommending Their Lordships to agree to its acquisition concurrently with the purchase of the land required qj the Admiralty. In coming to the foregoing conclusion the Council have had regard to the undertaking obtained from the Bahrein Petroleum Company in 1928 not to include in the areas they select any land required by the Air Ministry for a landing ground and seaplane base, They are, however, advised that it might oe difficult to resist a contention by the Company that this undertaking could not reasonably be construed as extending to sites not in the possession of the Department and in respect ox which the Department is only in a position to say that it might wish to acquire them during tne currency of the mining lease. They are further advised that even if tney were willin^ to assume that the Company would be prepared to extend its undertaking/undertaking to any areas, wiiicii may now be indicated to them as sites for landing ground and seaplane b .aes, tue fact that such sites had been so earmarked would be certain to become generally known and would tend to raise the price of the land, if it became necessary to acquire it. It is true that recent indications point to the exclusion of the two sites selected from the area of 100 ,000 acres to be demarcated b v ; the Company and that the India Office regard any interference bj the Oil Company as improbable. Nevertheless, as pointed out in paragraph i of Admiralty letter of the 11th December, i :*0354l/33 it seems probable that the Oil Company^ operations will tend to increase land values in Bahrein. I am accordingly to request ti .ut you will move I'heir Lordships to assent to the purchase of the two areas of land at a cost roughly estimated at £10,275 and to the insertion of provision for the purpose in Subhead E of Air Vote 4 for 1934. In the event of the purchase being completed during the current financial year, it is anticipated that the cost can be met from savings on the Vote as a whole.

Dated, Dil Haj, 26. 1352 April, 11, 1934 From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my demi-official letter No. c /l05 dated November 9, 1933, regarding the acquisition of certain land in the district of Jafair and to inform you that the government of Bahrain has now completed the purchase of all the privately owned land within this area. I enclose a plan of the area and a list, (No. 1) showing the owners of the private property, the approximate area of their land, particulars of buildings and gardens, and the amount of money paid to them by the govern ment as compensation. The total sum is Rs 36,415/-. 2. There remains a large portion of open land within the area which is presumed to be the property of the government though it is probable that Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa will claim that it belongs to him when he returns from Cairo. If such a claim is raised it may be necessary for the BahrainBahrain government to satisfy Shaikh Mohammed by- paying to him the price for which the open ground to which he lays claim was estimated, but this in any case is a matter for arrangement between the Bahrain government and Shaikh Mohammed. 3. In my letter No, C/l05 I estimated that the cost of acquiring the whole area would be approximately Rs 41,500/- of which Rs 8,816/- was the value of the open land owned by the government, and the remainder, Rs 32,684/- was the value of private properties, I found it impossible to satisfy the owners of the land with the amount which I estimated. I made cash payments to them amounting to Rs 36,415/- as well as gifts of land which are described on the enclosed list. Owing to the necessity for having had to disburse a larger amount to the owners than the sum which I estimated only Rs 5,085/- remains, if my original estimate is accepted, as payment for the land belonging to the Bahrain government. In my original estimate the value of this open government land was assessed at Rs 8,816/-, 4, As it was impossible to satisfy the private owners with the payments mentioned in my list No. 1, it was decided that in most cases the Bahrain government would give them pieces of land approximately the same area as the land which was taken from them. The Bahrain government has gifted to them the lands mentioned in list No. 2, which is enclosed. The approximate value of the land given to these persons as compensation amounts to Rs 10,500/-.-3- 5. The final financial result of the whole transaction to the Bahrain government is as follows. I estimated that the area would be acquired for Rs 41,500/- of which Rs 8,816/- represented the value of the land owned by the government. Actually it was necessary to make cash payments to landowners of Rs 36,415/- leaving Rs 5,085/- only, instead of Rs 8,816/- to cover the cost of the government land. This represents a loss to the government of approxi mately Rs 3,800/-. In addition to this the govern ment has been compelled to make grants of land to the landowners concerned whose value amounts to approximately Rs 10,500/-, so the total loss incurred by the Bahrain government in completing the transac tion is approximately Rs 14,300/-. 6. In my letter of 9th November I gave an approximate estimate for acquiring the whole area. I had no time at my disposal in which to examine the matter carefully. I did not inspect any of the houses or gardens as it was inadvisable to draw attention to the matter at that time. My estimate was therefore a very rough one. 7. At one period during the negociations I obtained the services of three assessors, leading merchants who are well acquainted with land values, Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Kozaibi, Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Ziani, and Haj Mohomed Tyeb Khunji. They examined one property which was estimated by me in my letter Ko. 105 at being worth Rs 10,600/-. They assessed the value at between Rs 20,000/- and Rs 25,000/-. I dispensed with the services of assessors and continued to deal with the owners themselves by bargaining.-4- fit) 8* The whole transaction has been carried out in about six weeks which is a very short time in which to complete negociations of such magnitude. With longer time at my disposal it is possible that the properties could have been acquired at a lower cost. The landowners have been treated generously; they have undoubtedly received considerably more than the value of their properties and the general public is well aware of this. Any other course than the payment of a great deal more than the real value of the land would have made the government the subject of considerable odium and would have raised a storm of criticism. 9. A proclamation for one month was issued on 27th Dil Qaad calling upon persons claiming any rights within this area to file their objections. No objections were filed. The persons whose ownership was registered in the land department were dealt with as I have described above. 10, The question of fish traps remains. The purchase consists of the land shown on the enclosed plan, it does not include the sea and the foreshore which are the property of the government. Certain persons however, among them some of the landowners whose property has been acquired possess fish traps in the sea adjacent to the area which has been purchased. The fish traps are their property and they enjoy an income from them. The actual areas in the sea enclosed by the fish traps are the absolute property of the owners. Their title deeds give boundaries extending over large areas but it is the practice of the government to recognise boundaries of fish traps not as rights-5- rights of ownership over the sea included in such boundaries but only in so far as no other fish traps or buildings will be allowed to be constructed within the boundaries. The sons of Shaikh Abdul Rehman, owners of the house on the north east point of Jafair have applied to the Bahrain government for a written guarantee to the effect that if the catch of their traps is impaired by the build ing of jetties, piers or by constant coming and going of boats or launches that the traps shall be paid for at their present value. In my opinion this is a very reasonable request and I am arranging to have their fish traps assessed in case of the question being raised in the future. 11• All the title deeds acquired from the previous owners of this land are lodged in the Land Department of the Bahrain government. I should obliged if you would inform me as soon as possible what nature of document you require in this connection from the Government of Bahrain, whether an ordinary title deed should be issued or whether as exchange of letters is required. 18. The occupants of the houses and gardens have been informed by me that for the time being they can continue to reside in their houses and that they will be notified when the land must be vacated. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Mviser to the Government.another large piece of ground was owned by Khalifah bin Khamis, Bahrain subject, at present in Bombay. 3. The property of the Bahzads consisted of approximately 1050 x 300 feet of land along the shore and 1200 x 1050 feet in the sea. The amount of compensation for the land was placed at Rs 5,000/- and this sum was sent to His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, as the owners are concerned in judicial proceedings in the Agency Court. The Baiizads also possess a large piece of ground on the coast outside the required area nearer to Manamah. An area in the sea equivalent to the piece which was acquired from them is being allocated to them in the sea adjoining their other property. As this is nearer to Manamah it is more valuable. The whole piece, land and sea, which has been Hcquired from them was originally purchased by them for Rs 4,500/-. They have been paid Rs 5,000/- for the land and have been given an equivalent area of sea elsewhere. 4. Khalifah bin Khamis has been given an area of similar size to that which he owned on the southern edge of the land delineated in the enclosed plan. He will be compensated by a cash payment by the Bahrain government on his return for an artesian well built upon his property and a hut and some stones. 5. Unfortunately the original title deeds of the Behzads have not been obtained from them. I suggest that before payment to them of the—the Es 5,000'- they should be required to sur render their title deeds. The title deed of Khalifah bin Khamis will be obtained when he returns and will be filed in the Land Department. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

A I f Ministry under our printed letter No. P«^ 9 3741/34 of 37th Aprils ana the political Resident s telegram of 30th April, No. 136, of which copies have gone to you to-day under our printed letter P,Z.2877/34, about the acQuisition of land for naval ano. air purposes at Bahrein. 2° 3ie Acimiralty will, I think, agree that it is very satisfactory to have concluded this transsxtion so promptly and. vvitn so little fric oion and it may be desirable not merely to express our appreciation of the assistance given by the Political Agent ano. the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government, hut to suggest for the Resident's consideration the desirability of an expression of thanks to the sheikh for his personal cooperation.. 3/ ♦ Powell, Esa., Aamiralty, ^ 3 r W « 1 .5/ 3. From Loch's report you will see tnat he ha , in fact, -i-H antic ipation of approval, hougiit at a cost of x?s.5^00 ohc aiea 'belonging to^ Sheikh Khalifah-Bin-Salmaxi# An expenditure of j ^S o 14 j 231 in ^e provisional estimates originally suhrnitted has^been incurred consequent on the cost of certain houses anci gardens proving to 'be laore than was anticipateo at the time» j\s the Political Agent points out, the estimates were drawn up uncier rather difficult conditions and while the excess is not inconsiaerahle it is, we think, understandable in the circumstances. 4= So far as I can see the whole of the excess is de tit able to the Admiralty. Ihe extra piece of ground (Hs.3 5 300) dovetails in with the areas which the Political Agent was authorised to acquire on their behalf. The excess expenditure of HSol4,231 appears also, so far as can be judged from the papers, to be wholly in respect of properties within the Admiralty area, for, as you will see from the statement appended to the Political Agent's despatch, the expenditure in respect of land acquired in ^udhaibiyah and Muharraq (for Air Force purposes) amounts to Rs. 137,000, being tne original estimate, and uhe additional expenditure is wholly in respect of acquisitions in Jufair.0 - (np) 5. you agree with the above we should be grateful iX you would, authorise us to arrange on your benall ior payrnent ol f^s. 17,531 into the account of the Bahrein Government with Lloyds Bank Limited, Bombay, as suggested in paragraph 5 of Colonel Loch's despatch of l9tii Aprilo You will see tnat the Political Agent states that it is desiraole that tnis should he done as soon as possible. 6. We should be grateful if you would also let us know whether you have any other comments on the points raised in Loch's despatch, subject to which, ana to the concurrence of the Air Ministry, we would propose to approve the action taken by hinio ^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Renael at the Foreign Office, and I enclose copy of a letter sent to IwcClaughry. We shall have to let the Bahrein Petroleum Company know in due course that these areas have been set asiae by us and it will be necessary to consider the wording of our letter to them rather carefully.

Abdullah bin 1 Isa is leaving suddenly by this nail (May 2Bth; for the Lebanon in order to get special aedical treatment (this is genuine) for one of his Family and expects to be away some six weeks* 2. i ha?e had conversations with hiia about the Budget and the Civil List, and have emphasised that the Government of India naturally regard the proportion of tiie revenue swailoweu up by the Civil List as far too high* I have tried to put into his mind that it is advisable to have definite proportions allocated to the Ruling Family and to the administration, so that in good times and in bad times they will share alike* He taices a sensible view in financial matters and understands them, and 1 will take these questions up again on his return* 3* In the meantime Shaikh Hamad is very anxious to Have a share of the proceeds of the acquisition of land, the amount mentioned on his behalf by Shaikh Ubdullah being 'one half of the balance'. The meaning of this in figures is as follows:* Payments made by His Majesty's Government to the Bahrain Government Rs. 196,031/- r ayment made by Bahrain Government to private owners 49,32?/- Balance to credit of Bahrain Government Rs.146,704/- Refunded to Reserve B8.60,000/~ Allocated to Causeway 30,000A 60,000/- Balance Bs.ofc,704/- Shaikh asks for Hs. 33,352/-4. I told th&amp;ikh 'Abaullah in one of the early talks that I had mentioned the matter to you and tnat it was desirable to settle the general question of the Civil List and kindred matters; and that I would write to you, 5. Shaikh 'Abdullah came over urgently on the 24th May and asked that the shaikh might have Hs.10,000/- to use towards the expenses of his relatives' moves out of the towns for the hot weatner and so on. I think that he hoped, if successful, to get the 1 haiku to give him something towards the expenses of his journey to the Lebanon! I felt that in view of how well the Shaikh had halped us over the acquisition and of his admirable reception of His Excellency the Viceroy (which cost him something), it would have been, and would be regarded as, scurvy treatmnt to make a ooiplete reiusal, or even to work for further delay, so event ually 1 gave him the 1x8.10,000/-. 6. Personally, i am very loath to connect the proceeds of the acquisition with any argument over the finances of the State, except to emphasise the one-third/two-thirds proportion, and Shaikh 'Abdullah points out with some force that half the balsnce is nothing like as much as one-third of the whole would be, and that in the time of his Father the Shaikh would have had the wholei 1 feel that tne Ghaikh has well earned a share, and as he has himself refunded half a lakh to the Reserve (which is a long move in the right direction for an Arab Euler), it would be hard to refuse him the comparatively modest share for which he asks, ite feels a natural diffidence in broaching the matter to ne himself, but i know that he feels strongly that he has a right to a portion and 1 would much prefer to approve his having the balance of E8 .23,352/- without delay or bargaining. if you approve, would you kindly telegraph the one ^ord *GHANT n . 7. i think that i should aad that a favourite device of /our3. :%) our enemies wben the Shaikh do e8 anjtnin^ to please us is to press him as to what he has got out of being our friend, ana in this c&amp;se for him to have got nothing for himself would be too good a chance for thea to miss.

His Majesty's Government agree generally, subject to Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.•r? -2- (\&amp;) to the following comments, with the suggestions in paragraphs 11-14 of Colonel Loch's letter of 19th April. (a) The Air Officer Commanding, Iraq has been instructed, to make arrangements for a representative of the Royal Air iorce with a knowledge oi surveying to check over the title deeds with a representative of the Bahrain Government, to see that the boundctr^, pillars that have been put up are sufficient, and to arrange for their upkeep, and the Admiralty ve agreed that this ofiicer should also exaunine the title deeds of the land which lias been purchased on behalf of the Admiialty• ^he oliicer in question will be instructed to furnish a i epoit contaiiing full pa r t i c u lar s of the areas acquired on the completion ot his examination. This report will cover the land acquired on behalf of the Admiralty and a copy of the report will be sent to the Admiralty by the Air Ministry on receipt. (b) No objection is seen jo the proposal in paragraph 12 \\ of the Political Agent's letter of 19th April, so long as you are satisfied that failure to collect rents from present occupiers over a period of 1 years will not invalidate the title Df His Majesty's Government, nor give the occupiers 'squatters ,, rights. As regards the print raised in paragraph 13 of the letter in question the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government have intimated that they would be prepare! to consider any claims which may arise in respect of damage to fish traps, but they observe that no damage is likely to be caused to fish traps unless and until the sites are developed. 5. As regards paragraph 15 of Colonel Loch's letter, it is thought that the most satisfactory course will be that the deeds, when they have been checked, should, as suggested by/■0 -3- fl by the Political Agent, be reprcducea for record by a photographic or other process; that the originals should be deposited in the India Office and that copies should be retained in the Agency at Bahrain and at the Residency in Bushir e. 6.

We also note that Major Papworth has suggested that Bahrein Government should be asked to grant the strip of land separating the two Admiralty areas. Subject to any remarks that the Political Agent may have, and on the assumption that this land is open space and would not entail any expense on purchase, we think that this suggestion is well worth following up. We feel that the present arrangement is unsatisiaotory anc that if guarantee of access to the Mosque is given the reasonable requirements of the Bahrein Government would be met. 4.

This was done and I understood from him when he returned me the title deeds at 18.30 hours on the 2Snd, that he had been over Qudhaibiyah before breakfast and Jufair after breakfast. He visited Muharraq in the afternoon. 2. The Victoria bringing Major Papworth had a forced ^ lyCrf/i landing on the mainland near Jubail owing to bad visibility, but it took off immediately it had got its bearings and before any of the Sa'udi officials could approach her. 3.

He was particularly interested to know where rJaor maiai T yah and the proposea LIuharra x area lay. 2* i emphasised that it was desirable to accjuire land now while it was cheap and essential that both the Naval cind Air requirements should be acquired at the same time to prevent raising the price unduly. He said that he would go into the matter carefully. 3. he asked about Henjam and I saia that I thought that it was hardly possible to retain it in present circumstances though if the Shah were to die things might return to normal in Persia 4. I told him where the Bahrain Petroleum Company intended to have their oil landing station. 5. I introduced the director of Customs (Mr.de Grenier) and the Agent of Imperial Airways (Mr.Russell). 6.

On tne morning oi the btJi February 1934 I discussea the question ot tiie acquisition of land witn tne Adviser* It was ( decided tnat tne best plan was to meet tne SnaiJm at tJae Tombs, wiiere he goes in tne atternoon,on Saturaay^ tne lOth February^ at It).30 nours and tnat I should there asic him to give Govern ment his help for this proposed acquisition. It was tnought best to snow him the areas on the mosaic map. It is probable that he will tell the Adviser to make arrangements and also tnat he may suggest that Shaiim Abdullah should be consulted. Snaiich 'Abdullah is certain to find out before long as part of the land in question belongs to him and it will be better to consult him from the outset it the Shaikh so suggests. * 3. Shaijfch Muhammad has certain t hibba f rights over Jufair and it is thought tnat it would probably be best to offer a lump sum based on certain recent transactions to buy out his rights,the sum being one which the Bahrain Grovemment would 1 . . , . , . .... give him it they had to acquire under their inherent xxgkt powers and that no bargaining should be entered into. He is understood at present to be short of money owing to nis visit to Egypt. 4. The general procedure for buying in otner places was also On the afternoon oi whe 10th February 1934 Mr.Belgrave and I met the Shaikh at the Tombs for discussion of the acquisition of land. I took with me the two mosaic pnoto- graphs which fortunately include all the areas wmch are required and have apparently made a considerable impression arranged 8-2-1934 on the Shaikn,who does not read ordinary maps with anyfacility. 2. After the usual courtesies I said to the Shai&amp;i that His Majesty's Government wish to ask his help in a certain matter. 1 said that in view of air developments they were anxious to buy land,Doth in Muharraq^ and Manamah lor their purposes (using the words among others 'ashghalhum' in order to make the sense wider than merely air). The Snaikh at considerable length said that he was very pleased to do anything that he could. The exact areas were pointed out to him on the maps, the Adviser being able to point out the individual houses and saying that they are the houses of so and so,so that there was no trouble and the Shaikh knows what is required. He said that he nad no objection to the acquisitions and agreed (indeed,! think that ne came out with the suggestion first) that it should be done by the Bahrain Government and then that the Bahrain Government should transfer the areas to His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh said that it would be better if the people would sell willingly but evidently contemplated that if they did not they would be made to sell. He asked that the matter should be disclosed to Shaikh Abdullah as he is clever at business and should be consulted. I readily agreed to this as it would,m any case,be impossible to keep him out 01 it as some of his land is to be acquired. I impressed on the Shaikh that it was necessary to keep the matter quiet as long as possible,because if it were known that His i^ajesty-s Government were interested the price ol land would rise and there may be difficulty with Persian owners. The Shaikh jumped at the latter suggestion and emphasisea that on no account^ ^irould Bushire and Tehran be allowed to get news , ■i of it. 3. The Adviser will get hold of Shaikh Abdullah and go into tiie matter with ium and bring Him to see me in clue course. 4. A note should be made based on the telegrams which havepassed showing exactly wnat areas are to be ac^uirea. It will be best not to do anytning in writing at tne moment but in oirder that tnere may be no mistake a copy snould be given personally to the Auviser. ll-H-1934. P.A .

On the 18th April I discussed with the Adviser the i meaning of the word'Sahil f, in the Shaikh's letter ahout 1 t'he acquisition of land. He tells me that in the local Understanding it certainly includes the shallow water 'beyond the actual dry shore. This is 'borne out by the tenour of X fehe translation sent by the Adviser with the Shaikh s letter and also by the context of the Shaikh's letter. The Adviser was satisfied and I am also that there can be no - I dispute about the shallow sea,but I record this note to show that the point was considered at the time. Telerram Ko:436 of 30/4/1934 from ResidentShaikh Abdullah came to see me on the morning of the 2nd Lay about trie money received from the acquisition of land, ohaikh Hamad had asked him to say that although he had not written in his letter about it, he though that he should receive some share of the proceeds of the sale. Shaikh T Abdullah said that Rs.50,000/- was to be returned to the deposit account irom which it had been borrowed, and that Rs.30,000/- were to go to the pier and that Shaikh Hamad should have some share of the remainder, which was Rs.73,000/- I said that I was not quite sure what the balance was as some presents had been made to other people, but what share did he (Shaikh T Abdullah) think that Shaikh Hamad shoula get of whatever the balance was. Lid he think one-third two-thirds would be suitable? He smilea ana saia , T, No, one- half ?t . I said that 1 would put the matter before the Resident. 2.

Mr.Belgrave had been invited, through the India Office to visit the Admiralty with a view to giving additional information on matters of detail in connection with the lana urcuased at Bahrein for the Admiralty. He stated that complete secrecy had been preserved about the land having been acquired for the Admiralty, the local belief being that it nad been obtained for the Air Minis try, and that the latter propose to give up Basra and Baghdad and move to Bahrein; Asked as to the nature of the land acquired, Mr .Belgrave stated that in the main it consisted of open or comjnon land with enclosures here and there consisting of houses surrounded by gardens; generally speaking no physical boundaries existed^ but his Oovernment had recently caused a number of concrete posts to be erected defining the limits of the land acquired# fhe Admiralty's title was absolute, i-e. e jiivalentto an English freehold, and there could be no interference with the Admiralty's possession. If the Bahrein il Company (who under their prospecting license could take up 100,000 acres for their oil field) wanted the Admiralty land they ould be tola that that area had been sold and was not therefore available to them® Mr.Belgrave/Mr*Belgrave considered it most improbable however that the Oil Company would want to extend their operations so ifar North. They already had some 7 or 8 wells in action about the centre ol 4 Bahrein island* and had actually commenced shi px &gt;ing oil to Ja y an* These wells wex'e connected by pipe line to tanks on Sitrah islands which had been connected to the main Island by a bridge? here also they had constructed a Jetty, ith an oil pipe line out to deep water. A tarred motor road had been built from the wells to Sitrah and another to Manamah* ABked. whether the Bahrein Government would endeavour to dispose of oil concessions over their remaining territory after the Bahrein Oil Company had taken up their 100,000 acres» Mr *Belgrave replied that in his opinion it would be impracticable to have two Oomx&gt;anies operating, but mentioned that the Bahrein Oil Company had some time **■*&amp; ago endeavoured to negotiate for rights over the remaining area. Those negotiations had Mien through on the question of price, but there were again indications that the Company wish to acquire the wider rights* The Company have up to the Sna January 1936, in. which to exercise their right to a mining lease under the terms of the current concession. In any case the Admiralty 's land and certain other areas of a special character, would he excluded from any such, negotiations. The nature of the land acquired for the Admiralty was sanay with coral rock a few inches helow the surface in the eastern portion, and a softer subsoil elsewhere. The foreshore and seabed was coral rock, capable of being dealt with by hand levers in lumps or sheets; from this it was assumed that a suction dredger «ould be useless, but that a dredger fitted with tusks, or possibly even a bucket dredger could deal with the coral. Mr.Belgrave/A K fp / ■ Mr.Belgiave was asked whether a crew could be found locally ioii* a aredger sent out from England with say, a Master and Chief Engineer„ and replied thatjhe thought a n itive c v t 1 j i /oljloly oi yomaliSf would be i ^uite efiicientf alter a little training f as deck handSj, but not as Engineers No dreagers capable of dealing with the coral were available at Bahrein* '^ocal buildings were usually built with walls of stone won from the foreshore or seabed, with flat roofs constructed on shuttering of cement and plaster® Practically all timber was imported from India and Persia and was expensive; fittings and ironmongery have to be imported. i&gt;iers or jetties would be of solid construction with facings of thy harder kind of coral and fillings of spongy coral. There would be no difficulty in building this class of jetty by native labour. Underwater work would ^ be done ^ ' ative divers wit,lout dre8S or any 8:5eoial &gt; apparatus. Mr*Belgrave stated that at the present uioment a causeway connecting Bahrein with Muharrak was being constructed in this way. Mr.Hunter in asicing Mr.Belgrave for his views as to what would be the best way to get our buildings actually erected, mentioned that sometimes the Air Ministry if they had Engineers on the spot undertook the work for the Admiralty. Mr .Belgrave said the Air Ministry's nearest organisation was at Basra, tot that if only simple buildings were involved he felt sure the Bahrein GovernmaU would do the work if desired# Asked about the prevailing sanitary system, ;\ j Mr .Belgrave stated that almost everywhere the dry system was in use, but that a water -borne system on the Admiralty land should be yuite possible as there was an excellent supply of wa ter from an artesian well on Abdul Wahab's land ana an inferior/ I i; k) 1 4* Xt* J/ inferior one to the south, both of which are at present used for irrigation. A small engine for pumping would be necessary. Mr.Belgrave*s attention was called to the statement in the correspondence that some ol the land ac^uirea had been taken in the absence of the owners; he stated that the owners had been co ajBunicated with by correspondence and the transaction was ^uite in order» The areas in question, however, were bought on Air Ministry and not Admiralty account* Translations ol the deeds of the Admiralty lend and copies of the plans pasted on the backs of trie deeds will 'be furnished to the Admiralty through the India Government* The mosque situated in the centre of the Admiralty land has not beeripurchased. A strip for access had been provided for in acquiring the surrounding land; this will be shewn quite clearly in the plans illustrating the deeds. As to the suggestion that the Admiralty should make a smalipayment towards the upkeep of the Mosque for its use by the Admiralty's Mohammedan personnel^ Mr-Belgrave explained that such places of worship are administered by a department .of the Bahrein aovernment, to whom any Admiralty contribution should be tendered. He did not, however, suggest what the amount should oe» With regard to roads and tracks shewn on our plan^ Mr.Belgrave stated that the 'public road' referred to in a footnote on the plan was a trivial affair and even if now in use by the public would present no obstacle to the Aoniralty 's development of the area. He was unaware of any roads crossing the area referred to aa 'Open Ground - Dismt- ed', and thought the narlcs shewn on plan were probably old boundary lines and not roads. In any caee. all roads and rights of way have been extinguished by the ao ,uiBitio u Asked/\ 5. ^ r Asked whether the arrangement for the previous owners to remain in occupation of their houses and gardens until these were required by the Admiralty would entail any risk of squatters' titles toeing created against the Admiralty, Mr.Belgrave thought not 9 but stated that in Bahrein law a squatter stile could be acquired in ten years, and suggested that to avoid any future difficulty the Admiralty might grant tenancy agreements to the former Owners at nominal rents o -f say an anna : er annum on monthly, quarterly or other terms* Mr .Belgrave explained that he could arrange the tenancy agreements if asked to do so by the Political Agent, without in any way revealing that the Admiralty were interested* He saw no reason for doing this through the Air Ministry. A reference was made to a recent newspaper statement that : ersia was laying claim to the Bahrein Islands: Mr.Belgrave stated tnat Persia had been doing this at intervals for the past 100 years, and had been again stimulated to make the claim by the discovery of uil on Bahrein. He explained that the Islands were independent, hut were under the external protection of the British Government, | Mr. Hunter thanked Mr .Belgrave for his viait ana for | the helpful and interesting information he had given.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and officials at the India Office and Air Ministry in London. The land acquired at Jufair for naval facilities is discussed in detail in ‘File No. 5/7 I Jufair Naval Base’ (IOR/R/15/2/216).In 1934 the British Government acquired four pieces of land in Bahrain: 1) an area, approximately 1200 x 1000 yards in size on Muharraq Island, for the development of an aerodrome; 2) a strip of the coast on Bahrain Island, approximately 800 x 400 yards in size, for use as a seaplane anchorage; 3) a large expanse of land at Jafair [Jufair], south of Manama, for the purposes of a British naval installation; and 4) a second plot at Jufair adjacent to the first, also for naval purposes. The correspondence indicates that Government officials in London were keen to acquire the land in question as expediently as possible, while trying to keep the identity of the purchasers (the Air Ministry) unknown.The volume includes copies of public notices announcing the imminent acquisition of land (most in Arabic, folios 57, 58, 86, 87), copies of the title deeds (all in Arabic and with maps on the reverse, folios 179-82), details of the costs of acquisition, including excesses (folios 76, 77), and subsequent surveys of the acquired land (folios 210-17, 225-29). The volume also includes numerous large-scale maps, including sketch maps of the proposed areas for acquisition at Muharraq and Manama (folios 15, 16), and more detailed maps (accompanying reports) showing the boundaries and dimensions of all four areas of acquired land (folios 69, 83, 88, 194-98, 218-21).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
