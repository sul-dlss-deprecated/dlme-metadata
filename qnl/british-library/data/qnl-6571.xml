CABLE COMMUNICATION. LANDING EIGHTS FOR THE CABLES OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT IN PERSIA.Memorandum on Landing-Rights for the Cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Persia. 1.— Landing-Rights at Bushiee. The landing-rights at Bushirewere regarded as a feature in the agreement made with the Persian Government in December 1862, for the construction of a line of telegraph via Khanakeen, on the Turco-Russian frontier, through Teheran to Bushire, as an alternative to the line through Turkey to Fao, and thence by cable via Bushire to India. A copy of this agreement (marked A.) is annexed. It had been suggested that formal application should be made for landing- rights on Persian territory for the cable down the Persian Gulf. A despatch was sent from the Foreign Office to the British Minister in Persia on the 18th October 1862, in the following terms :— “ I have been informed by the Secretary of State for India that it has been determined to effect telegraphic communication with India, in the first instance, by means of a cable to be laid down the Persian Gulf, and that it is intended to establish a station at Bushire, and also, if necessary, at or near Bunder Abbas. I have accordingly, in compliance with Sir Charles Wood’s request, to instruct you to apply to the Persian Government for the necessary permission for that purpose.” But the British Minister at Teheran considered this undesirable, replying on the 7th February 1863 in the following terms :— “ With reference to your Lordship’s despatch of the 18th October, I have the honour to state that I have not mentioned the subject of that despatch to the Persian Government, because I am certain that separate stations for the Turco-Indian line of telegraph at Bushire and Bunder Abbas can be easily obtained by judicious management when the Convention for the Khanakeen and Bushire line is ratified by Her Majesty’s Government. Further, I may state that when the ratification takes place there will be no difficulty about the line being extended from Shiraz or Bushire to Bunder Abbas. I had a distinct assurance from the Itizad-oo-Sultaneh, the Minister of Public Works, that the Shah would undertake that extension. “ I believe, therefore, that I am able, before leaving Teheran, to report that I have arranged the whole question of the telegraph, and that the only thing wanted is the approval of Her Majesty’s Government.” In pursuance of this understanding, the Persian Government ordered the Governor of Bushire to give the requisite facilities for the landing at that point. A copy of the document conveying this order (marked B.) is annexed. On the 23rd November 1865, a formal Convention was entered into between the Governments of Persia and Great Britain, and under it, a second wire was attached to the line already existing from Khanakeen to Teheran and Bushire. This Convention took effect from the opening of correspondence on the second wire and remained in force for five years from that date, viz., to 12th August 1872. A copy of this Convention (marked C.) is annexed. On the 19th June 1872, this Convention was extended for three months from 13th August 1872, see C. 2 annexed. The next Convention (dated 2nd April 1868) related to an alternative line along the coast of Persia and Beluchistan. A copy of this Convention (marked D.) is annexed. A 24 In 1870 the through line of the Indo-European Telegraph Company was opened to Teheran vi&amp; Djoulfa (on the Russo-Persian frontier). The Khanakeen-Teheran section was, therefore, practically given up and a new Convention was entered into between Persia and Great Britain on 2nd December 1872, under which iron posts were to be substituted for wooden ones and a third wire erected on the Teheran-Bushire section; one wire being used for Persian local traffic, and the other two being reserved for through traffic with India and the Far East. This Convention applied specially to the Teheran-Bushire section, but would apply equally to the Khanakeen-Teheran section if the British Government should wish to resume charge of it. A copy of this Convention (marked E.) is annexed. The rights secured to Great Britain under the Conventions of 1868 and 1872 were to expire in 1895; but a Convention was concluded in 1887 extending these rights to 1905, and another Convention in 1892 provided for a further extension to 1925. Copies of these Conventions (marked F. and G.) are annexed. 2. Landing-Rights at Jask. In the above-quoted despatch from the Foreign Office of the 18th December 1862, reference was made to landing-rights at a point (Bunder Abbas) on the Persian coast in addition to Bushire, and the reply of the British Minister with regard to the facility of obtaining landing-rights applied to both those points ; but the Order of the Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire specified the latter point (Bushire) only. Landing rights at Jask are considered to be implied in Article II. of the Convention of the 2nd April 1868 (marked D.) to the following effect:— “ The English Government will pay annually to the Persian Government the sum of 3,000 tomans for leave to lay down the line of telegraph on these coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia.” The possession of land for a cable station at J ask is,moreover, set forth in an agreement of the 25th February 1887 (marked H.) containing a clause in the following terms :— “ The telegraph establishment, which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the point, take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the telegraph establishment, 400 yards from the present boundary fence between which and the telegraph establishment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from the end of the promontory to the limits of 900 yards ; at the end of these 900 yards a wire boundary will be drawn, and the Government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits.” The cable is landed within the limits specified. B. T. FFINCH, J anuary 1900. A. Engagement entered into by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for the construction of a Line of Telegraph from Khanakeen to Bushire. (Translation.) 1. The Persian Government considers it necessary to construct a line of telegraph without delay from Khanakeen to the Capital, Tehran, and Irom Tehran to the Port of Bushire, and they agree that, whenever the English Government may require to communicate by the said telegraph, they are to be at liberty to do so through the Persian Telegraph Offices in the way they may desire, paying for the same at rates to be specified hereafter.6 %L 2. The Persian Government will assign a sum sufficient for the construc tion of this telegraph, and for the purchase of such materials as are not procurable in Persia, or can he better obtained in Europe. 3. The Persian Government engages to purchase from the English Government all the materials which are better procurable in Europe, and the English Government agrees to supply such materials at moderate prices. 4. In order that the said line of telegraph may be well constructed and officially worked, the Persian Government agrees to place it under the superintendence of an English engineer officer, who is to be paid by the English Government, and they further agree to fix a period during which instruction may be given and the line may be brought into good working order ; and His Eoyal Highness the Itizad-oo-Sultaneh, the Minister of Public Instruction, and His Excellency the Amin-ed-Dowleh, will have cognizance of the aforesaid officer’s proceedings. 5. The said officer will be fully empowered to call upon the Persian authorities to supply any materials he may consider requisite for this work, and the Persian authorities will make no alteration in his requisitions unless it should be impossible to obtain the thing required. But a Persian officer will accompany him everywhere, so that he may be informed of what is done and of the prices of the materials, and the accounts will be audited by the above- mentioned Prince and by the Amin-ed-I)owleh every three months, when a report will be drawn up and printed in the “Tehran Gazette.” 6. In order to increase the friendship between the tw-o Governments, and to promote the above undertaking, the English Government engages to purchase in England at reasonable rates, with the approval of the Persian Minister Plenipotentiary, the materials required for this work, and to convey them to the Persian frontier, and to receive from the Persian Government the price paid for the above articles by five instalments in five years after they are delivered on the frontier of Persia. (In the handwriting of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.) The Persian Government accepts this engagement. If the English Government desires it, the construction of the line of telegraph will be commenced in conformity with the above stipulation. B. H 13488. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Governor of Busuire. 18th May 1863. As you already know, by desire of His Majesty the Shah, the Persian Government are about to construct a telegraph line from the frontier of Kermanshah to Bushire, and the English Government, as they may feel disposed, are at liberty to j&lt;&gt;jn their telegraphic wires, which are to be brought by submarine line, to the Persian wires; it is therefore necessary that they should have a telegraph station on the coast, and His Majesty has ordered 'that a station should be erected for this purpose at Besheer, under the directions of the Prince Itizad-oo-Sultaneh, which is to be given to the British Government for an annual rent. The Prince has written the instructions necessary, and they are now r sent to you. In the meantime, as the English cable may shortly reach Bushire, and on its arrival they may require a place at once in which to keep their stores and materials before the regular station is completed, you wdll now at once, after communicating with the Eesident, and ascertaining the exact spot where the cable wdll be landed, proceed to erect a building according to the accompanying plan given by the Prince in a suitable position, and get it in readiness, so that they may not suffer inconvenience. You will then forward an estimate of the expenses of completing the building, and when you receive orders on the subject, you will have it finished by building the additional portion. A 3His Majesty has further commanded that the station also required for the employes on the Persian line of telegraph from Bushire to Khanakeen, is to be built alongside of the station constructed for the English Telegraph to India, so that for the better working of the lines, the two stations are not to be apart and distant from each other. c. Convention between Her Majesty and the Shah of Persia relative to Telegraphic Communication between Europe and India. Signed, in the English and Persian languages, at Tehran, November 23,1865.

Q12 First Order of Saint Maurice and Lazare, and the First Order of the Saviour of Greece, and the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden, and the Second Order of the Legion of Honour, and the First Order of the Osmanieh ; And the aforesaid distinguished llepresentatives, after meeting in the Capital of Tehran, and perusing and exchanging their full powers, which were found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:— ARTICLE I. To expedite and facilitate the transmission of international messages, the English Government will, at its own expenses, and under the superintend ence of its own officers, erect a third wire, in addition to the two already in operation between Tehran and Bushire, and will also substitute iron standards for the existing wooden poles. The English Government agrees to substitute the above iron standards at the rate of five hundred (500) annually; and the Persian Government engages to pay in ten annual instalments the sum of ten thousand (10,000) tomans to the English Government towards defraying the expenditure incurred on these iron posts. During this work, the Persian Government engages itself to render to the Superintending Officers every assistance in its power of which they may stand in need. ARTICLE II. Whereas all British subjects in Persia are entitled to the protection of the Persian Government, under the operation of Article XII. of the Treaty of Paris, of March 4, 1357, it is now provided that the British employes of the Telegraph Department, being charged with public duties, shall be every- Avhere placed under the special protection of the local authorities, who shall furnish guards when necessary, and otherwise assure their personal safety. ARTICLE III. Until the completion of the third wire provided for by the above Article I., the appropriation of the existing first and second wires for local and inter national messages shall remain as at present, viz., as regulated by Article VIII. of the Convention of the 23rd November, 1865. ARTICLE IV. After the completion of the third wire, notice of which will be given to the Persian Government by the Director of the English Staff, the appropriation of the three wires shall be as follows: The first ware, viz., the one set up originally in 1864, shall be used for local traffic, while the second and third wires shall be used for international traffic, with the exceptions herein-after specified in Article VI. ARTICLE V. To prevent any confusion in the working of the different wires, the first wire shall be worked by Persian Government employes, and the second and third wires by English Government employes, separate rooms being provided by the Persian Government for the said English and Persian employes, in telegraph offices considered suitable by both Administrations. ARTICLE VI. (a.) Should the first wire be broken at any time, one of the others shall be temporarily lent for Persian correspondence, until communication by the first wire is restored, provided always that both the second and third wiresare at the time in good working order throughout their length, and free from contact. (b.) Should the first wire be in contact with either the second or third wire while the remaining wire is clear, the wire in contact with the first wire shall he insulated, to allow free working by the Persian employds on the first wire until the contact is removed. (c.) Should the first wire be in contact with the second or third while the remaining one is interrupted, or should both second and third wires be interrupted, or should all three wires at any time be in contact, the resultant single line shall be used by the English and Persian Administrations in the respective proportions of two-thirds to one-tliird of the day, the exact hours to be fixed by mutual agreement between the English and Persian Directors. ARTICLE VII. The revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wire shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic are meant messages originating at (me Persian station and terminating at another Persian station. ARTICLE VIII. The Persian Government having already made an arrangement with the Indo-European Telegraph Company regarding the revenue derived from the Indo-European traffic, the English Government will abide by that agreement as far as they are concerned; tliat is to say, the Persian Government, in consideration of a fixed annual payment by the said Company of either twelve thousand (12,000) tomans, or of two (2) francs per message cf twenty (20) words, renounces all claims to any portion of the revenue from transit traffic over the line from Julfa (on the Russian frontier) to Bush ire. This revenue shall therefore be divided betv een the English Government and the Indo-European Company in such manner as ihey themselves may decide, and the accounts between them shall be settled without the intervention of the Persian Government. As regards international messages originating or t(rmmating in Persia, the Persian Government agrees to cede to the English Government for a term of three (3) years the entire Persian terminal tax on such messages, in consideration of a fixed annual payment of two thousand (2,0C0) tomans, to be paid to Persia by the English Government. After the three years, the Persian Government shall be free either to accept an annual payment calculated on the basis of two-thirds of the average terminal receipts, or to claim two-thirds of the receipts of all fide terminal messages. The Persian Government agrees to leave it to the sense of justice of the English Government to decide which are bond fide terminal messages, and which are to he considered as transit messages, being forwarded to Persia evidently for the purpose of being re-transmitted to other countries. During the time this Treaty remains in force, the Peisian Government engages itself to oppose at the International Telegraj h Conferences any alteration in the present transit and terminal rates, unless a previous agreement with the English Government shall have been made. ARTICLE IX. The English Administration being responsible for the correct transmission of all international messages, and for the adjustment of the accounts, will collect the payments for these messages according to the rates of the prevailing International Telegraph Convention. All international messages originating in Persia shall, before trans mission, he registered and sealed by officials appointed by the Persian Government. C 2International messages terminating in Persia shall be delivered to the addresses through the agency of the same officials, who shall be bound to give receipts for such messages to the English Administration. The Persian Administration shall at all times have free access to the English offices, and to all records connected with international traffic. International messages are those which pass over the wires of more than one State. ARTICLE X. The maintenance of the line, including repairs, and the appointment, control, and payment of the Line Guards, shall remain in the hands of the English Director and staff. As a contribution towards the expenditure under this head, the Persian Government will pay to the English Director the sum of one thousand (1,000) tomans annually, this amount being deducted from the royalty due to Persia by the Indo-European Telegraph Company, as hereinbefore described in Article VIII. ARTICLE XI. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and Line Guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. If the line be wilfully damaged, the Persian Government will take the most stringent measures to oblige the local authorities to apprehend and punish the offenders. The Governors of districts will be accordingly instructed to pay prompt attention to all complaints and communications made to them by the English officers. ARTICLE XII. In case of any wilful damage to the line, the expense of repairing the same shall be defrayed by the Persian Government. ARTICLE XIII. To enable the English Director to have a perfect k lowledge of the state of the wires and offices, and thereby to provide for their general efficiency and the rapid removal of any impediment to telegraphic communication, the orders and regulations issued by him regarding the connections within the offices, and the times and manner of testing the lines, shall be strictly obeyed by the Persian telegraph officers and signallers. ARTICLE XIV.

With regard to the bountfries of the Telegraph Establishment at Jask, in accordance with the information received by the Persian Government and the British Legation, it has been decided as follows under date of the month of Jamadi A. H. 1301 (February 25th, 1887). C 1That the Telegraph Establishment which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the point take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the Telegraph Establishment, i.e. 400 yards from the present boundary fence between which and the Telegraph Establishment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from the end of the promontory to the limits of 900 yards ; at the end of these 900 yards, a wire boundary will be drawn and the Government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits. As the Telegraph Establishment well is about 1,000 yards distant from the boundary agreed upon, it is decided that the road and waterway from tlie well to the place where they meet the limits be protected and no one shall build upon, destroy or interfere with them ; and for the preservation of the well itself it is agreed to set aside a space around the well to be walled in at a distance all round of 100 yards from the well. The Customs and other buildings of the Persian Government Agent must be without the limits above agreed upon and be built on the place agreed upon between Mr. Pftnch and the Malek-i-Tajjar. It is agreed that the Telegraph Officials and their true, positive and salaried servants be exempted from Customs dues. It is agreed that stores for provisions and the necessaries of existence which aie brought from the interior for the Telegraph Establishment, such as rice, ghee, wood, etc., and such like be exempt from taxation. It is agreed that if any of the dependents of Jask, other than the true, positive and salaried ^ivants of the Telegraph Establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection penetrate within the limits, the telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them ; on the contrary they should place them without their boundary and hand them over to the Government of Jask. Any merchant, native or fore'gn, who may have shops within the limits must pay the usual Customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy or sell. (Signed) A. NICOLSON.
