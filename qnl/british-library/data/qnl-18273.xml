Samuel Hennell states that the Durya Beggee still persists in rejecting overtures for a reconciliation with Bakir Khan of Tungistoon [Tangest훮n]. Hennell reports that around the end of May, a number of men broke into the home of the Governor of Cazeroon [K훮zer큰n], Abbas Kooly Khan, with the intent of murdering him and his wife. Both the Governor and his wife were severely wounded. Hennell also provides details of the defeat of Ally Kooly Khan by Sheik Houssein ben Jubbarah of Congoon [Kang훮n]. The letter concludes by stating that Sheik Nasir has received a rukum from His Royal Highness and a letter from the Nusseer ool Mulk, both of which request the Sheik's immediate attendance at Shiraz. Hennell expresses his doubts that Sheik Nasir will go to Shiraz. The letter is followed by an enclosure: a translated substance of the monthly report from the Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Mahmood, which concerns affairs in Fars between 28 April and 28 May 1850.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000029#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
