The first bout was between two small boys from the Muharraq primary school, and Indian, Pakistani and Bahraini boxers provided the contestants in the other six bouts. Care had been taken in the appointments and lighting of the ring, the contests were well conducted, and the programme was carried through with a smoothness and despatch that is the more creditable as it is the first time that a Bahraini club has . staged a boxing competition.

The virtual monoply which Mr.Yateem enjoys is, however, soon to be broken as a new ice factory is being built for Abdur Rahman al Gosaibi, the machinery for which recently arrived in Bahrain, and two other Bahrain merchants have ordered plants for ice factories. One of them, Hussain Ahmeli, is providing his ice factory with ample cold storage accommodation. The manufacture and sale of ice is a profitable industry in Bahrain though it has to be seen whether there is enough business for four ice t factories. It has been estimated that Husain Yateem is receiving a net profit of around Rs.2,000/- a month for his ice factory. This figure has been calculated from the controlled price obtaining for ice and should be considerably . larger in fact for Mr.Yateem is known to sell much of his l daily output of ice on the black market. He is not unaware of what dangers lie in competition, and has prepared against - x them by importing another ice plant and by engaging an Italian Engineer as his refrigeration expert. (vi) Crim e.

On the 8th, Shaikh Isa bin Salman, the eldest son of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, was married to the daughter of Shaikh Salman bin Ibrahim A1 Khalifah. His Highness gave a number of 'wedding breakfasts', and entertained His Excellency the Political Resident, Mr.B.A.B.Burrows, the Political Agent, and about 30 other members of the local European community to dinner on the 12th. On the 6th Shaikh Ali, the eldest son of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifa and a cousin of His Highness overtook and stopped his car in front of the car of Father Anselm, the Roman Catholic Chaplain of Manama (an Indian subject) and struck Father Anselm when he got out of his car to ask the reason. Shaikh Ali who was the worse for liquor appears to have been picqued by the fact that a policeman on duty at a traffic junction gave Father Anselm's car the right of way rather than that of Shaikh Ali which was at a greater distance from thepoliceman. As a result of the Political Agent's writing to His Highness, Shaikh Ali was summoned before his father, Shaikh Abdullah, and Mr.C.D. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, sitting as Judges of the Bahrain Court, and sentenced to confinement to the island of Muharraq and the payment of a fine of Rs.4,000/-.

His Excellency the Political Resident, His Highness Shaikh Salman, and most of the Bahrain Government officials being present. Old boys are critical of the fact that most of the ' ’athletic' events have given place over the years to ceremonial marches, drill displays, football on stilts, and musical chairs, but the younger generation of school boys seems to enjoy such items immensely. Spectators who were a little bored at seeing all thirty members of a troupe performing in turn the most ordinary feats on the vaulting horse were compensated with a raffle on the programme numbers, the lucky winner receiving his money prize from the hand of the infant son of His Highness. On the 12th the Police Sports were held in the grounds of the Manama Police Fort. A long programme included sprints, a relay race, pole vaulting and a display of tent pegging. It was marred for early arrivals by the spectable of a number of shackled prisoners putting the finishing touches to the sports ground, while officials bustled, prominent guests were led to their seats, and the Commandant of the State Police puffed contentedly at his cigar. (iv) N^bi.Saleh Tragedy :* Jezirah or Nebi Saleh, a small island of the West Coast of Manama Island, contains the tomb of Nebi Saleh, a local Shiah Saint, and forms a place of pilgrimage for Bahrainis of the Shiah sect.

Some forty persons are said to have lost their lives. On the 10th a fire broke out in a barasti hut in Muharraq and one of the two inmates, and old blind woman, was burned to death. The Muharraq fire waggon (there is, it appears, only one firewaggon for the town of Muharraq) was very late in arriving at the scene of the fire and two fire waggons from Manama and one from the RAF station got there before it. The fire has revealed an alarming state of neglect and inefficiency in the fire fighting arrangements of the Muharraq Municipality. Onifey one man, a driver, was on duty for the evening, and he could not be found when the fire started.

On the 7th April Abdullah Bangoor, Iraqi caretaker of the Royal Naval Establishment at Jufair, who isn.iquor permit holder .spent a convivial evening with three prostitutes and some of his friends.

It is also reported that taxi drivers who are caught conveying a foreigner to the house of a prostitute are to receive a sentence of six months rigorous imprisonment. (ix) New Building Projects? The growth and prosperity of Bahrain is reflected in the many new buildings recently built or under construction. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co,Ltd., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., have recently built new residential quarters for their staff a few miles outside Manama town.

(Report not yet received). H.G. Jakins Political Agent.2 1 tr With the lifting of the cares of State from his shoulders the health of Shaikh Abdulla is reported to be inuch improved 9 On September 11 an American Missionary doctor was called to him because he seemed to be seriously ill and to have lost the power of speech. His condition was diagnosed as a surfeit of camel meat. One incident ruffled the course of affairs in the early part of the month when Shaikh Abdulla asked for the money supplied by the Oil Company for the payment of the guards and was given it by Shaikh Ali and Saleh al Mani 1 . When the Political Officer remonstrated with Shaikh Ali he claimed to have recovered the money from his father. As the Qatari authorities raised the question of appointing a police officer the permission of the Shaikh of Bahrain was obtained to the secondment from Bahrain of Inspector Cochrane who arrived in Doha to take up his ap pointment on September 3. After Shaikh Ali had recovered from his surprise at so speedy an arrival he authorised the recruiting of 15 men to start with. The available ma terial is quite raw and untrained. The Shaikh of Bahrain offered Qatar thirty rifles and ammunition as a loan until they could import their own. For some reason which is not yet clear Shaikh Ali wished to refuse this offer but was dissuaded by the Political Resident while in Doha from giving such gratuitous offence to the Shaikh of Bahrain. 75 rifles and 7,000 rounds of ammunition have been ordered on behalf of Qatar who are jibbing at the price. Meanwhile' interest is centred in some 450 rifles that the former ruler acquired in 1939 and for which he recently obtained ammunition. The rifles are presumably, in what sort of condition is not known, with Shaikh Abdulla in Riyan although both Shaikh Ali and Saleh al Mani’ denied the existence of any serviceable rifles in the peninsula. A check on the rifles in the possession of the guards at Dukhan is proceeding. Mr. Allcard's visit (see paragraph 133 (ii)) was in connexion with (a) the unloading of cargo in Qatar hitherto done by Bahrainis carried there for that specific purpose. Shaikh Ali wishes the work, which is semi-skilled, to be done exclusively by Qataris and (b) the opening a branch of the firm in Doha. 137. TRUCIAL COAST. F/0 J.E.

Ruler of Dubai, accompanied by his brother Shaikh luma'h bin Maktum, left for Ras al Khaimah to look after his gardens at Khirran and Shama’al. On August 31 an exchange of fire took place between Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, and Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim, the eldest son of the former ruler. Saqr bin Sultan appears to have tried to force villagers near Mania’ to pay annual taxes to him as well as to the ruler. The villagers appealed to the ruler who went with a party to restrain Saqr bin Sultan. When firing started the ruler is reported to have returned to Ras al Khaimah. There were no casualities on either side. It is rumoured that Shaikh Sai'd bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, proposes to repair the road of Hatta which runs between Muscat and the Trucial Coast. Arrangements are said to have been made between the Sultan of Muscat and Shaikh Sai'd during his last visit to Muscat. 138.

(i) B ajo c o 0 Reference paragraph 127 (ii) of Summary No,15. Aramco are reported to have reacted violently to the establishment by Bapco of a survey aid station on Arabi. Aramco claims the island as Saudi Arabian territory. Bapco now propose to extend their exploratory activities in the waters to the area lying north, north east and east of the Island of Bahrain as far as the bank Fasht Abu Safah having received an assurance from the Shaikh that the area lies within his territory. (ii) Rev aluation of Sterling . u* Pakistanis employed and paid locally are dis turbed at the extra cost of remittances to Pakistan and at the prospective loss of part of their savings and the de preciation of provident funds. At a meeting of the chief local firms held at the Agency to discuss the question it was clear that no agreed common policy could be reached. The question is now beingconsideredofficially as the Agency staff includes Pakistanis. (iii) S lipway project , Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd, propose to build a slipway on the Muharraq side of the bridge connecting Manamah and Muharraq. The Shaikh proposes an alternative site on the Manamah side of the bridge and this is to be given technical examinationx. ■1 (iv) Reference paragraph 134 of Summary No.16. Shaikh Humaid bin Saqr, brother of the Ruler of Sharjah, left for Sharjah by launch on the 29th. 145. QATAR . (i) Zu barah . As a result of the call at the Foreign Office by Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser, and Mr. Ballantyne, the Shaikh considers that not every dot and comma in his voluminous correspondence with the Agency on the subject of Zubarah has been faithfully transmitted to London and so he is in clined to feel that his interests have been neglected. He also thinks that the change of Ruler in Qatar is a golden op portunity for settling this ageing dispute. It might be but for the fact that Shaikh Abdulla although abdicated still stays on in Qatar and is still visited daily by his son the new Ruler and, even spoke recently of paying a visit to Zubarah himself. The attitude of the Shaikh o*f Bahrain is now very reasonable and as a bait towards settlement he has offered to substitute transit dues on goods for Qatar passing through Bahrain instead of the full dues now levied. The Shaikh is now asking for an assurance from His Majesty's Government, not Qatar, that his rights in Zubarah will be respected.3 I i (ii) Gray Ma cke nzie Messrs. Gray 9 Mackenzie &amp; Co . 9 Ltd. (see paragraph 136) are acquiring a site near the Customs Jetty at Doha and are preparing to build there. (iii) Cable arr Wire less Ltd . The question of starting public telegraph facilities in Qatar 9 including radio telephone communication with the United Kingdom and the United States of America 9 is under con sideration. (iv) Bri tish Bank of Iran and the Mi ddle Las t The bank has received permission to visit Qatar with a view to studying local banking possibilities. (v) Political A g ency In Doha. The Ruler has offered to provide a piece of land for the new Agency building in Doha and the various alterna tive sites are under examination. (vi) Tnt erna 1 Organisation . The progress of the Ruler towards becoming an enlightened monarch is extremely slow. His personal expen diture is on a fairly generous scale but he shows little en thusiasm for promoting the extremely feeble growth of his new police force and n,one at all for organising his State. He is unable and unwilling to distinguish between personal and State income. And when asked to draw up a tentative budge', ended by declining to consider the matter. In this he was doubtless prompted by his father who is showing signs of^ surprising rejuvenation and whose idea ol State finance is that all receipts she ild go direct to the privy purse and stay there. In order to ease the monetary demands of the Shaikh's relations it is proposed to find them., where pos sible, suitable employment in government service. This project however has made little headway. It has been es timated that two-thirds to three-quarters of the Customs dues collected find their way at the pocket of the Director of Customs. A proposal that motor vehicles^should be li censed by the police was accepted by the Shaikh but the re- &amp;ultafitincome is likely to go in the Shaikh's pocket rather than in helping to pay for the police force as was intended. The delay in appointing an Adviser is to some extent responsible for the failure to make headway in Qatar. But a much greater obstacle is Shaikh Ali's outlook m whj-ch he is encouraged by his father, by local influences^such as the Darwish family and tkx by the example of Saudi Arabia, oil royalties in Qatar are not to be frittered away but a P“ plied to the public good a very firm line will' sooner or iat^r have to be taken with Shaikh Ali. The appointment of an Adviser remains the first essential step. Meanwhile there are hopes of a reconciliation between Shaikh Sa’ud bin Abdur Rahman of Wakra and the Rule^ who i4 who is reported to be ready to accept the Shaikh as Emir of Wakrah. Shaikh Sa'ud seems to be a strong character, and to have him in authority in the neighbourhood of the new tanker port of tlmm Said might have many advantages. 146 o TRUCIAL COAS T. (i) Move ments of Shaik hs. On the 17th Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashic^Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain, arrived at Sharjah. He visited the Medical Officer for medical attention and returned to Umm al Qaiwain the same day. v 3 , Shaikh Sai‘d bin Makturn, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, returned to Dubai from Ras al Khaimah during the period under review. (ii) Local Affairs . On the 16th Jasim bin Dalam, a notable and wealthy merchant of Jazzirat az-Za’ab, was killed at al-Hail (16 miles south of Ras al Khaimah) by three of Ayal bin Qazib, subjects of the Rulei of Ras al Khaimah._ The murderers fled and took refuge with Saif bin ^li bin Saif, Chief of the al-Khawatir tribe. Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, sent out a party of armed men to trace the cul prits but failed to arrest them. The Ruler of Ras al Khaimah asked Saif .bin Ali to hand over the murderers for punishment and offered him Rs.10,000 'Ikramiyah' to release them; but following tribal custom he refused. It appears that the said killed man is the uncle of Abdullah bin Hassan, Shaikh of Jazzirat as-Za’ab. The assasination arose from domestic troubles. On the 23rd a gang of the al-Awamir robbers attacked a caravan of Dubai near the r JabeiaFayah pass on its way from Dubai to Batinah. They looted four camels and then ran away into the desert. The Shaikh of Dubai sent out a party of 10 armed men on camels to pursue them. On the 25th Shaikh of Dubai arrested six men who were reported to be selling 'Araq f and had in their possession three barrels and other distilling equipment. They were lashed, their faces were coloured with tar and were driyen through market and public places. After fourdays imprison ment they were released. (iii) Tan b Isl and . The Captain of L.T, 'Nearchus' was informed by the lighthouse staff at Tanb Island that according to the local villagers the Persians have placed a flagstaff on Nabiyu Tanb. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, has been requested to divert one of His Majesty’s ships to Tanb Island to look into the matter. (iv) Slavery . Reference paragraph 113 of Summary No.13. The kidnapped woman, Asrah bint Rubin', was brought back to Sharjah by Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr, brother of the Ruler of Sharjah, with the help of Rashid bin Hamad al-Shamsi, Chief of the al-bu-Shamis tribe in Buraimi. It isI2 ^? t ,f avo ^ rS - I a P riv:: -leged class and is inequitable for non- pnvx.eged classes. The machines are all of British manu- lacture. The question seems to be bound up with the rake-off +-n ^ agh f ad , re P re fentative and again points the moral that t ^ ade ln the Gulf direct local agents should be appointed and openings not sacrificed to Levantine middlemen. (v) Air Services . ^Mr. F. Bosworth was given permission to run pleasure flights during the Id holidays. He has also been Io^ n - Permi f? 10n for n °n-schedule flights to Sharjah from Bahrain pending a decision on the question of his running schedule flights to Sharjah. * (vi) Pearl mar ket. Pi^berman, a United States pearl merchant, whose own company is associated with the United States firms oi Jacques Bienfeld Incorporated and the Sea Gems Company and connected with dealers in the United Kingdom and France visited Bahrain to study the pearl market. He said that Bahrain merchants would not sort the kind of pearls he re quired for sale in Europe and the United States so that he ° fcl mu ed ' t ° P ack ets of which he could only use about iv/oo The remainder would have to be re-imported to Bahrain or exported to India. He estimated that in Bahrain and uoai there were large accumulations of good pearls awaiting a market. He said that there was a demand for pe-rls in the United Kingdom and France, that was second only to that for 2 i ai ? 0 ? ds ? , ? s ar ? i nsu y a hce against depreciating currency and that lor the first time in history pearls were cheaper in the united States^than in Europe and European buyers had crossed the Atlantic in search of them. Mr. Lieberman claimed that sales of cultured pearls encouraged the demand for real pearls. e said that as a result of publicity De Beers had improved their diamond sales and he felt sure that the real pearl market would respond to publicity, American, British and xrench merchants would be prepared to contribute. He said that a proposal to this effect had been made to the Bahrain Government, without result, two or three years ago. He intended to re-examine the market in Europe resulting from revalued currencies in the light of the knowledge lie had acquired of the local market in Bahrain and to return here next s ea s on. (vii) B ritish Police De tachmen t. The Bahrain Government have engaged a fourth man from the former Palestine Police and all four are expected to arrive in Bahrain shortly (viii) Malaria Cont rol. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are carrying out measures to control malaria in twenty-six villages on the island using a solution of D.D.T. per gallon applied and requiring one gallon of liquid per acre water surface. The solution is sprayed in a very fine mist and no damage to gardens should result.Situation in Qatar c Ali and the ’Id part of result c 152o QATnR (i) Shaikh Abdulla who abdicated remains in the pe ninsula and the Darwish family have extended the influence they exercise over him to his son the present ruler Shaikh Ali. (ii) Id Calls Calls on the first day of the 'Id were paid to Shaikh Abdulla. Among the callers was the Ruler Shaikh All. Shaikh Ali received on the second day. The Political Officer called first (as soon as he was available) on Shaikh afterwards on Shaikh Abdulla. On the last day of Shaikh Sa'ud of Wakra paid a call on Shaikh Ali as a plan of reconciliation but with little apparent (iii) There are elements in Qatar that look forward to a new deal in the peninsula but Shaikh Ali is no F.D.R, His object seems to be to scrape along until the royalties begin to pour in and then to live for himself alone. No administration is being set up, no progress is being made with the budget, the whole country stagnates and the forces of reaction dig themselves in deeper every day. The need for appointing an Adviser grows daily more imperative. (iv) Inspector Cochrane (who at least has got his strength of the police with uhe He hopes also to increase their a short visit to Bahrain to buy pay) expects to increase the end ,of the pearling season, present low wages. He paid materials for the Police and and favourite son Ahmad who is nominally in charge is intelligent, helpful and promising. 153.
