This pioblem has giown in importance since 1932, owing to the increasino’ indications of a drive on the part of the Saudi Government to reduce certain foreign elements in their country, especially such as tend to over-populate the towns and, m particular, Mecca, with nondescripts. Broadly speaking, it may be said that their policy is less open to criticism than the methods employed in their spasmodic attempts to give effect to it. The growth of xenophobia, however, directs attention to the lack of any droit d’etablissement whatsoever. I have dealt with the whole subject at length in a recent despatch to the Foreign OfficeI * PiFILE COP LJG/WB ( 37 groups ) DXCJLP H.

Having received no reply, t took occasion of Fuad bey H&amp;mssa 1 a presence in Jedda on ICovember 16 to question him. He denied having seen my second note, explaining that it might well have missed him owing to hi© recent movements between T&amp;if and Mecca, bhough far from satisfied with this explanation, I did not labour the point, for Fuad bey undertook to study my note on Ms return to Mecca and to ensure that it was answered. Meanwhile he gave me a verbal assurance that zay information regarding the nationality Committee’s activities In Mecca was. so far as he knew, incorrect. I replied, that I had withheld my first note until 1 had satisfied myself that my information was substantially accurate and that i should therefore be glad if ha would look well into the matter before my note was answered, since my object was to keep my Government fully and accurately informed* fhis he promised to do. I am still however without a reply. 5* nevertheless it seems that the Committee’s activities ceased in the early days of this month, after it had completed its survey of the Mu’abda quarter of Mecca, in which almost the only foreign residents are Hadhramie. About the same time it was learned privately that the Amir of deada had received orders to constitute a similar Cojasdtuse ana that the Mayor of Jedda /had Hi© Majesty’s Principal ..a eretary of btate for Foreign Affairs.haci advised his accountant^ who happens to he a British subject, to naturalise himself an Hejassi* Ho effect has yet been given to these orders, however, and my latest information is to the effect that the whole matter has been referred to RiyUdh* 4« I do not regard this step as securing more than a breathing- space, rhe foreign elements in the population of .iecca and J'edda m*e considerable and their existence gives grounds for a degree of foreign consular intervention which this Government resent, eepecially in regard to Mecca* Certain of these elements, such a© the west African for instance, also present an economic problem in hard times* I do not think we shall be very far wrong if we take it as axiomatic that the government would like to naturalise as Hejassis all foreign elements of value to them and to get rid of the rest.I think it probable therefore that the Committee will resume its work before long and with these two objects still in view* but that it© methods will be modified. It remains to be seen how the necessary element of threat will be used. 5* fhe attitude which this Legation should adopt seems to be clear up to a point, namely that of insisting that sufficient time is allowed for the obtaining of confirmation of any claim to British nationality, but it may be necessary to seek your instructions beyond that point, should this Government cling to their objectives and prove intractable. 6* There is one exues ulon however which seems to require immediate consideration, that of Iladhramia. A few hold British passports, the majority hold no documentary evidence of nationality. Then these apply to this Legation for papers, as they well may, their names and particulars will be referred to the Chief Commissioner at Aden, but I know of no existing form of passport with will oh they can be issued /Hot$©£ only would an unsatisfactory local situation eu»ise, in which ) some iiadhramis who happen to have obtained .British passports in their travels would he regarded as foreign subjects or protected persons, while the rest would be classified by this Government as hejasis, but political repercussions might also be felt if and when Ibn Ge’M begins to extend his sphere of influence to the H&amp;dhramaut coast* I am not at all clear to what extent we control or ”protect 5 ’ that series of secluded valleys and petty sultanates, nor how, except in Egypt, the somewhat ineeterminate status of its adventurous natives is regarded by other Governments in relation to His Majesty’s Governments. Here, however, the question takes on a special character and possibly special importance.

Since 1929 natives of the Hadramaut have not been treated as British protected persons^In the same way as natives of the other Dependencies of Aden on the ground that the territories to which they belong are not ’’British Protectorates” but “States under o British protection”; but^as the Resident at Aden has recently pointed out^the treaties between His Majesty*s Government and the Chiefs in the Aden political sphere who are under British protection a.re all similar in form and intention^and there appears to be no justification for a distinction between the 'Aden Protectorate' and the 'Hadramaut'. These treaties contain a clause conferring on the £hief and his rfependencies 'Gracious favour and protection', and although there are Chiefs in the Hadramaut with whom we have no treaties, most of the territoryeain this relationship to His Majesty’s Government. Actually^ since neither the Hadramaut nor the other dependencies of Aden are administered territories both are strictly speaking rather under British protection' than 'British Protectorates'/■ &gt; • Protectorates”, but it is desirable and has become customary to treat natives of the Aden Protectorate as British protected persons^and it is fair that Hadramis should be similarly treated. Subject to the views of the Colonial Office and of this Office, the Foreign Office propose to authorise His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda by telegram to issue passports to Had rami s^ where required as British protected persons. Before the appearance ofthe Foreign Office circular of 10th March last which laid down separate regulations for#* ^^^^atives of the ’’Aden Protectorate” and of the Hadramaut^a direct arrangement had been made between the Resident at Aden and the Minister at Jedda that His Majesty’s Legation should issue such passports where proper and necessary, and full details of the procedure to be followed have been arranged locally. * It may be mentioned that in 1914 (TT was considered desirable to treat natives of all the Aden dependencies as British protected persons and, about the same time and for political reasons arising out ofthe war, even natives cf the Yemen. r~ Subject to the. views of the Colonial-Office is r~lac/ ia*. we may concur..w^i^bheforeign Office proposal and., a draft letter-to the Foreign Office in this sense is submitted. ^ % % n \ JOi&amp;c f a —■»-#/100,‘J 4000 7.31 Draft Paper.

While in Foreign Office circular, No. T 2117/593/578 of the 10th March last, a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter of March 22nd last, a distinction is drawn between natives of the Aden Protectorate and natives of the Hadramaut, the Resident and Commander-in-Chief at Aden has, as Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, recently suggested that the distinction of name between the two territories should be obliterated, and that all the tribes and tribal areas hitherto spoken of as being in the Hadramaut should in future be spoken of as in the Aden Protectorate, since they are in fact in the same relation to His Majesty* s Government in the United Kingdom as the tribes of the Aden Protectorate and since the whole area is supervised from Aden. 3. You will remember that the difference in treatment in regard to travel facilities between natives of the Aden Protectorate and natives of the Hadramaut was made, in 1929, on the ground that the states of which the latter are subjects are not British protectorates but states under British protection/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.

The conditions under which the passports should be issued were discussed with Mr. Champion, the Protectorate Secretary at Aden, during a visit to Jedda and full details of the procedure to be followed, e.g. in regard to consulting the Residency at Aden in individual cases, are on record at His Majesty’s Legation. 4.

The enclosed extracts give the more important articles of the regulation as it affects the general public. The other articles deal with the machinery for taking the census, the forms to be used and the steps to be taken against persons furnishing false information or refusing to give the required particulars. 3. Broadly speaking the machinery is to consist of a central committee, three sub-committees for Mecca (which are to include Sheykhs of quarters and notables nominated by the central committee) and similar sub committees in sufficient numbers elsewhere. The sub-committees are to collect full particulars regarding natives and foreigners and the central committees are to draw up in due course returns showing each of these categories/ Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.categories separately. A scale of remuneration for the suh-committees is to he fixed later. Persons giving false information are made hahle to a fine of from five to one hundred riyals or imprisonment of from one to twenty days. Persons refusing information are to he warned and threatened with imprisonment in the first instance and, if still recalcitrant, to he actually imprisoned until they comply.

The Hejazi Government have ordered at short notice a census of all male inhabitants of towns in the Hejaz. One of the main objects is to determine the proportion of foreigners.

(T 8266/8045/378) JEBI)A . Jane 21st, 1932. Sir, The Umm-al-Qura newspaper of June 10 announces the intention of tne Eejazl Government of preparing a sort of nominal census of the male population of the cities in this country in order to combat the economic and other evils result ing from the constant influx of foreigners of all nationalities some of them undesirables. The announcement explains that the sole object is that stated and assures the native population that they need fear nothing in the nature of conscription or capiuation tax. The matter has been referred to the Legislative Assembly in order that the necessary regulations may be drawn up. 2. There are so many alien Moslems in this country, some with and some without documentary evidence of foreign nationality, that the proposed regulations might be made a means of widespread oppression, but it will be time enough to worry about them when, if ever, they are put into force. I may say that, although a difficult intervening period might have to be traversed, I should not be sorry to see in the final result a considerable diminution of the semi-settled population of various British origins in a country which has so little to recommend it as a place of sojourn once a man has achieved the object with which most come in the first instance, that of performing the pilgrimage.

It was agreed that I should send the Sheikh a list of cases in a personal letter. I sub sequently delayed this letter, as I heard of one man having been paid and hoped that others might have the same good for tune, in which case I should be spared the necessity of draw- img up a list in which holes could be picked. It was also brought to ay notice that certain chauffeurs had been warned against appealing to the Legation. One has always to reckon with the danger of exposing applicants and possible applicants for assistance to further oppression, rather than doing them good, if one takes up cases too often or too strongly in the deplorable conditions of this country. 4 # Tae matter took, a new and more serious turn,, how ever, on March 27th, when a report was widely circulated that certain chauffeurs of various nationalities in Mecca, who had demanded their arrears of pay and threatened to go on strike if they did not get them, had been imprisoned and in some cases severely beaten in public. There have been various versions of this incident but the reports that reached me loft ho doubt that the men had been most harshly treated and that they had boon so treated under the order® of the higuest authorities^ 5 # This compelled me to consider the situation very carefully* I have tried to avoid fresh causes Mli of quarrel with the Hejasi Government pending the liquidation of the Trans* Jordan frontier question and I am anxious that the atmosphere for the impending negotiations between the Iraqi Prime Minister and the Hejasl Government should be as favourable as the state of the Trans—Jordan question will allow. I was also hampered by the difficulty of obtaining precise information and of being sure that the chauffeurs who had been maltreated Included men whosewhose title to British nationality or protection could be pro ved* On the other hand it seemed essential not to ignore the incident* 6# Sheikh Yussuf Yasin came to see me i’or other reasons on March 09th. We had a long and amicable conversation ^ on various subjects and I d elded to seise the opportunity of speaking to him In friendly but categorical language about the chauffeurs. I remind d him of our conversation of March 16th, and said that, while I was preparing the personal letter on which we 'had agreed, 1 had heard two reports. The first was that after our first conversation, Sudanese chauffeurs had been warned not to appeal to the Legation* It was, I said, the right of any British subject or protected person to lay any grievance before me and it would be contrary to every principle of international law, if any local authority interfered with the exercise of that right. The second report was that the chauffeurs had been imprisoned and oeatsn for having demanded .| the arrears due to them* I could not I said, vouch for this report any more than for the' first x*eport t but, if it came to my knowledge d finitely that any British subject or protected person had been treated in such a way for that reason, I should strongly protest. Sheikh Yussuf gave me the reply which was to bo expected* He admitted freely the right of recourse to the Legation* If ermuffours had been warned against appealing to me, it could not have been a consequence of our conversation of March 16th as it was known only to himself, the King, myself and my interpreter* He suggested that, although any British person had a right to come to me with his grievance, people of the class concerned were apt to distort things; to which I retorted that that was the very reason I had waited nearly three■BSMm three months 'before taKimg action* He dismissed the second report as incredible and Expatiated on the King’s special sol' icitude for the we ale and humble* I ara afriacl tlaat. In the interest of the cause $ X echoed some of this humour {though it is perhaps not wholly humbugj for the King Is often gemer-*- ous to the lowly) even on Pals Sunday * ent, which I received on March 50th. It has been prepared by Captain Seager from information supplied by an African* It is not necessarily accurate on all points but it bears out gener ally in a coherent form, iny earlier information* flic affair has been so bruited and has created such emotion that two Oj. my household servants related it spontaneously and with much indignation to my wife* X hope to hear more irom tne Indian Vice-Consul who went to Mecca on March 31st* In the Beantime I have had a conversation with my French colleague* A s I ex pected he is not very keen* He had heard the same story and he promised to mike indtpond^nt enquiries* d&amp; gave me another account of the origin of the trouble which he heard some weeks ago* The chauffeurs, according to this version, were discon tented because the Government had introduced stringent rej'dila tions to control petrol supplies etc., thereby depriving them of opportunities for peculation* This is quite possibly ix , ue but the temptation to steal must be increased by irregulariuy in the payment of wages. Yasin may produce some effect* I propose to take no further action for the moment* I have, however, reported on the whole subject fully for more than one reason. I consider, and I trust you will agree, that, if the trouble continues, no political consideration should restrain me from making strong- I enclose a further account of the Mecca incid 9* 1 hope that my conversation with Sheikh Yussuf representatlons irepresentations, provided they seem likely to have a good ef fect as regards any British subjects or protected persons con cerned* Ibn Ba t ud and his underlings are far too ready to think that they can do as they please, especially In the case of Moslems of small account* Secondly, I consideir that the British authorities in the Sudan and British Somaliland would do well to discourage natives of these countries from coming to this country to seek employment* The case of Kadraiaia may be rather different and I hope to discuss it Ji&amp;kthis month with the Protectorate Secretary at Aden, who is visiting me here* Thirdly I conoid r that, in spite of the difficulty of keeping any general register of British and British protected persons of African and Asiatic origin settled in the Hejaz owing to their number and the vagueness in laany cases of theis national status, something should be don© to encourage a larger proportion of them to provide themselves with proper papers* I will study this difficult question further* 10* I am sending copies of this despatch and enelo? sure to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Depar tment), The Governor General of the Sudan, the Governors of British ;-emailland and Nigeria and the Political Eesid nt at Aden* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

(According to my infor mant orders had been given by the King that they were to be all but beaten to death*) A clerk is said to have been present beside the slaves jotting down the number of strokes made to ensure that each man received the same number* Two of the Som alia are said to be in a dying condition and medical aid is said to be wanted for them* 4* The king Is reported to have been present together with the Amir Faisal and Sheikh Abdullah Phllby* 5* There is no doubt that a stir has been caused in chauffeur milieus and that the men have been harshly treated* 30/3/3110.130. mx TI3H LM 1 ATIOT , April 7th, 1931. » oq APR ■ *^ - - '' ■ *w Sir, la despatch Mo. 121 of April 1st relative to the position of chauffeurs employed by the Hejaad Oovernment I stated that I prox&gt;osed to take no further action for the time being.

I had, I ©aid, been greatly distur bed by my information but. Instead of writing a note, I had preferred to speak to the Sheikh on March 29th* I had then said that I could not vouch for what I had heard about the men being imprison© and beaten. That was true as regards the details but as a matter of fact I knew a great deal. It was certain that mm had been imprisoned and beaten* Whatever the immediate cause, the ultimate cause was that their wages had not been paid. I had good reason to believe that they included British m&amp; 4 British protected persons. and could now tell me what had happened. The Government chauffeurs included men of various nationalities, Syrians, service of the princes and the palace. They were treated very liberally in the way of tips etc* It might be that their pay I Introduced the question of the chauffeurs by Sheikh Yussuf said he had been making enquiries His Majesty*s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.UMMMHK mm overdue* Th^y were not always to tha E«ja» on pay-day and they were really so well off that they did not need to draw their wages mid preferred to let tlieia moxmt up* ' levertlieleaa a certain imsmei* of thm had mz&amp;e trouble and tried to organise a strike# these had tried to get the others , to join them imd, an meeting with a refusal, had set upon them* -■■ppi froopo had hem called out to restore order# &amp;• I ©aid that, if the men imd 15 © much cause for happiness that they did not need their wagoe, it was odd that I had hem given a list of 40 people in the M©J*ua who seemed to want them* I had, not received petitions from all of them hut I imd ted half a ciosm or so mostly frcaa mu employed by the trmsport Company run by the Govemmant# I did not know what the local law on strikes was, hut if 40 mm were kept out of their pay to my own country there wemM he a strike mid, it it went on, there would he a revolution# The chelkh observed tlmt there was no such thing n© a strike in this cmuatryi that mrt of thtog was }mi rebellion# I said that there wm nothing to the Koran or the traditions about strikes hut tout there m&amp; a very great deal about people getting their $mst dues# 1 suggested that the extent of the Motion e&amp;uoedy 'by the incident was not realised* X did not, X said, encourage ay servants to bring such things to m notice* When two of them comm to w wife with the story, it was evidence of a widespread feel tog# 6. ateikh tmmti? told me that tlm .'^vermaent had d elded, to pay off toe recalcitrants and discharge them* 1 mentioned a ru^iaur that they were to be deported# 1 suggested ttet the wisest nom*m for a Govenfmmt which ted created a grievance, allowed toe situation to develop until there was a breach at Um peace ate than bam compelled to restore order0 ord^r wua, a« scnm as mat aeoeas&amp;ry step had bem takaa, to resoTe gidamixce and retrain fro® ai^ former tttmM '.'ieaeurea* i&gt; # -me c^vormitlon, %iiich was entirely frtexiOXy, haa served w im*i&gt;oa© of oiiod laoro Mp^sl^hg tli.# Imrdalilp Imposed osa. the elmuffe : ur© 'W zw^pvwmnt of wago© and tHpras- ||m cm the MMMl MM liiliitlir | had pjRiMMrifti done the gravity $f the ttaning incident* Ae I plated out to him* the informxxticm he gave m© differed fr*oa m omx In only one important pnrtlcul&amp; § mm&amp;W ttot I Imd heard nothing of w qnarrol attended fey violence asaong the cliauffeurs themselves* 1 do not 'tiiink that I oan usefullp' pursue Urn rmtmr further, luileaa there la fresh trouble hut in view of the possibility of further developments, it may fee wall to place an record such fresh information a© has reached » since fey conv^sation with aheikh fusauf fasto -on April 1st* V # the following ©tatem^nt of these furtliox* parti- euX&amp;rs is feasod cm the news brought feae&amp; fey the Indian Vice- consul from Meeeu and imde fey during the last few dsysi- (a) Oaptain aeuger points out tfeat the otouffeurfe have a wide roag© of action and it is tuits xosslfele ttet the 40 men whose com-'laints were reported to hlM would not all fee in the rnfm at a given moment, mife laight Justify tip to a point one of dhei&amp;h Yuaauf*« contentions.
