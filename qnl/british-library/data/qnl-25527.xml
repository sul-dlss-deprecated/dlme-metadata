I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 3614-E. B., dated 16th September 1907, on the subject of the concessions held by the “ Sponge Exploration Syndicate”. 2. Since that date I have periodically enquired of Hatinoglou’s Bushire acquaintance Mr. T. J. Malcolm (Messrs. Strick’s Agent) what news he had of the Syndicate, and regarding Mr. Hatinoglou’s intentions; and Mr. Malcolm informed me up to quite recently that he bad had no news whatever from him for months past, and that he supposed that the project must have been abandoned. On 23rd September, Mr. Malcolm informed Captain Trevor confidentially that Messrs. Strick had desired him to obtain standard samples of sponges obtainable in the Gulf, and asked that our Agent at Lingah might be asked to help him to get them. Khan Saheb Agha Badr was accordingly instructed to try and obtain some samples and to send them to the Residency. On 29th September, Mr. Malcolm stated that Messrs. Strick now cabled that Hatinoglou had lost the concession and enquired whether he, Mr. Malcolm, thought it worth acquiring. On 22nd October, Mr. Malcolm reported that Messrs. Strick now inform ed him that Mehdi Khan, Persian Charge d’Affaires in London, held the concession and that as the people to whom he had first granted the right to work it had not done anything, he had cancelled it and was naturally anxious to get somebody else to take it up. They asked Mr. Malcolm’s advice and repeated the previous request for samples. On 2nd December, Mr. Malcolm forwarded a copy of a memorandum which he had received from Mr. Strick under cover of a letter, dated 13th November, and asked mv Tiews on the subject. In reply I advised him to recommend Messrs. Striek to consult His Majesty’s Foreign Office, and request them to c-iuse such instructions for the accord of co-operation to be issued to me as they might consider called for. A copy of Messrs. Strick’s memorandum referred to is attached. o T rermest that Mr. Malcolm’s commnnications may be treated con- fidentiaUv, e&lt; ottmi'wise there may be danger of his getting into hot water with Messrs Strick, and hesitating to furnish me with early information in future. ^nd February 1906.

His Majesty’s Government have instructed me to inform the Persian Government that, according to evidence which has reached them, it -'-.Ussfe tseems probable that the Sponge Exploration Syndicate will apply for, or, in default of proper control, assume, the right to fish for pearls in those waters. The pearl banks on the Persian shore are, as Your Highness is aware, visited by boats from the Arabian as well as the Persian shores, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees to the local authorities. On 18th June 1900 I informed the Persian Government, in obedience to instructions from Lord Salisbury, that His Majesty’s Government could not recognise any contract which would interfere with the established rights of Chiefs under British protection. Y r our Highness will agree that any infraction of these rights, hitherto enjoyed, would inevitably lead to grave complications, which both Governments wish to avoid, as well as to the increase of the patrol duties, already sufficiently heavy, of the ships of the two Governments; and from this point of view I am to inform Your Highness, in anticipation, that His Majesty’s Government will view with grave concern any open or tacit amplification of the Sponge Concession as communicated to His Majesty’s Legation in December last.

With reference to previous correspondence respecting the conces sions obtained by the Sponge Exploration Syndicate from the Shah of Persia and the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by Secretary SirE. Grey to transmit herewith a copy of a letter from Messrs. Eussell and Arnholz containing enquiries on the subject. Sir E. Grey would propose to reply that His Majesty’s Government are aware of the gi anting of these concessions, but that the Muscat Concession is for a duration of 15 years only, and does not grant exclusive rights of fishing for sponges. With regard to their enquiry as to whether there wmuld be any objection to the concessions being financed by clients of theirs, Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished with Mr. Secretary Morley’s view's as to whether, since it appears impossible to do anything towards the cancelling of the concessions, it would not be desirable to encourage British capital to take them up in order to obviate the nanger of their falling into the hands of foreigners.

A 2 S. 17.On the 19th November 1905 (21 Ramazan 1323) His Highness the Sultan of Muscat granted a similar concession to the same Syndicate with respect to the waters over which he has sovereignty. Both of these concessions are for fifty years.

Eoreign Office, g; r 15th May 1907. With reference to your letter of 7th Eebruary 1906 relative to the affairs of the Sponge Exploration. Syndicate, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter from Messrs. Paddison, Trevor, and De La Chapelle, who are acting as solicitors to that association, forwarding a translation of the concession granted by the Sultan of Muscat, and soliciting a declaration from His Majesty’s Government that the terms of this document in no way infringe the rights of other persons protected by the commercial Ireaty between Great Britain and Muscat, and that His Majesty’s Government recognise the concession as being perfectly in order. A comparison of the translation forwarded herewith with that of the same concession which formed the enclosure in your letter of 11th January 1906 reveals the existence of an important discrepancy between the two, viz., that whereas the preamble of the India Office version only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the “ permission to produce sponges from ” his “ waters,” that of Messrs. Paddison’s version declares that he leases to them “ the sea of ” his “ kingdoms ” for this purpose. It appears to Sir E. Grey that, if the translation of the concession now given by Messrs. Paddison rightly reproduces the sense of the original text, that instrument does, in fact, grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat waters during the period of the lease, and thereby constitutes a violation of the Treaty above referred to. I am accordingly to request that, should Mr. Secretary Morley see no objection, steps may be taken to ascertain from the Government of India, who are understood to be in possession of a copy of the original text of this concession, which translation is the correct one, and I am to inquire whether, should it he shown that Messrs. Paddison’s version is accurate, this discovery would not modify the opinion expressed in your letter of 7th Eebruary 1906, that the concession cannot be held to be a violation of Article IV. of the Treaty of 1891. I am further to draw your attention to the passage common to both versions of the preamble, in which it is stated that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to the Syndicate to a distance of ten miles in breadth, and I am to state that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the Sultan of Muscat and the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, Limited, should be informed that His Majesty’s Government are unable torecogmsB the right of the former to confer such a privilege outside of the territorial waters and over the high seas situate between three ana ten miles from the coast. llliee The Under Secretary of State for India.

Annex 1. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Foreign Office. Tehran, 23rd April 1907. In my Despatch No. 275 of 7th November last, I had the honour to transmit to you copy of a note which I had addressed to the Persian Government warning them that the concession which they had recently granted for sponge fishing in the Persian Gulf might be abused, and that any amplification of it which might interfere with the pearl fishery in those waters would be likely to raise serious difficulties. I now have the honour to transmit further correspondence which has passed between the Persian Foreign Office and this Legation on the subject. You will see from the Ala es Sultaneh’s note of the 19th ultimo that the Persian Government deny that the Sponge Syndicate are authorised to interfere in any way with the pearl fishery in the Gulf. As the concession to the National Bank contained a clause giving the Bank the right of exploiting the Persian pearl fisheries, I considered it would be prudent to enter a renewed caveat as to the rights acquired by British protected Arabs, by way of lease. I explained verbally to the Foreign Minister the purpose of my note, and he assured me that, according to Mahommedan law, due respect would be paid to acquired rights in any concession made to the National Bank or any other institution. I have, &amp;c., The Right Hon. Sir Edward Grey, Bart. Omitted. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Ala es Sultaneh to Sir C. Spring Rice. 19th March 1907. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of 20th October 1906, making certain statements regarding the Sponge S. 22.Exploration Concession. In reply to your note, and for your information, I have the honour to state that no right whatever has been given by the Persian Government to the Sponge Exploration ^ Syndicate for pearl fishery. If the Syndicate is carrying on any operation it is in connection with the sponge fishery. The Syndicate has so far not applied for, noi has the Persian Government thought of, granting the right of fishing for pearls. If any information with regard to this matter has reached the British Government, the Persian Government has none. If such a measure has been taken by the Chiefs, or if the British Government has discovered that they have taken such a measure, I request that the Persian Government may be notified, in order that the necessary inquiries may be made, and, if proved to be true, steps for its prevention may be taken. You stated in your note under reply that “ the pearl banks on the “ Persian shore are visited by boats from the coasts of Arabia as well as “ Persia, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees “ to the local authorities.” You also referred to your note of the 18th June 1900. As I do not properly understand your object in making this state ment I cannot give a reply. But when you state in this connection that “ any infraction of those rights would inevitably lead to grave compli- “ cations which both Governments wish to avoid,” I have no doubt you will consider me justified in expressing surprise, for the Persian Government have always on important occasions given, and will give, proof of their desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two States, and they will never permit British subjects to suffer in their legal interests, not speaking of matters of no importance, with regard to which the Persian Government do not understand why the British Government take the trouble of making representations. Annex 3. Sir C. Spring Rice to Ala es Sultaneh. 3rd April 1907. I beg to thank you for your note of the 19th instant about the Sponge Concession. My object in writing was to prevent any incident arising owing to misapprehension which could disturb our friendly relations. .When two people are friends, it is, as you know, their custom not to wait until a difficulty arises, in order to speak as to their rights. If they think that a difficulty is likely to arise, their custom is to warn each other beforehand _ in a friendly way in order that by timely action a difficulty may be avoided according to the verse “a stitch in time saves nine ” and “prevention is better than cure.” The pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf are of course, as far as they are within the waters which belong to Persia, Persian property, and no one will ever dispute these rights. But the rights have in some places been leased by the local Persian authorities to Arabs, some of whom are under British protection. If these leases are suddenly altered and annulled the Arabs will of course complain, and make difficulties and these difficulties would cause difficulties between our two Governments. C l rC ! er • t ° a 1 V01( l tllese difficulties I wrote you the letter of 20th October m order that you might know what people say who are in the Persian Gulf namely, that Arabs living on the Arab coast have contracts giving them the right to fish for pearls in waters belonoW to Persia which have been given them lawfully by the local Persian Governors, and that these contracts are good and valid and cannot be cancelled without compensation. I said this foi two reasons, one, because our Governments are friends and because it is better for us to warn each other beforehand of anyarisen ; die other, that' b^th* ow^vemSs 61 ^*’ f® llas subjects, should suffer in their legal interests * ^ 0ther ’ or Its own Enclosure No. 7.

As to value ot the sponge beds either on the Persian or Arabian we have no infor mation at all; nor, as regards sponges reported to have been sent home by Wonkhaus —vide enclosure to our letter of 11th April,—have we been able to ascertain the result of examination in Germany. We consider that, if Syndicate has proof of existence of profitable sponge beds, the more British capital embarked in the venture the better. We may point out that it may be possible for us, if necessary, to induce the Sultan to refuse foreign companies admission on the Arabian shore, seeing that syndicates are given no power of alienation under Muscat Concession. Enclosure Xo. 8. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 16th July 1907. In continuation of my letter of the 29th May, on the subject of the concessions granted to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate by the Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose, to be submitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of n ffi *.^{r d T 7 | th , Julyl9t,7(Sentt0l?0reign a telegram* from the Viceroy, ce 1 11 ' stating that the translation of the Muscat Concession forwarded with the letter from this Office of the 11th January 1906 is correct. The Muscat Concession is thus not open to the objections based on the translation furnished by the Concessionnaires which were expressed in your letter of the 15th May, No. 14,782. But as regards the per mission to fish for sponges “to a distance of 10 miles in breadth,” to which attention was called in that letter, it will be seen that the Government of India agree that the Syndicate and the Sultan of Muscat should be informed that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the latter to confer such a privilege beyond the limit of Muscat territorial waters ; and Mr. Morley proposes to instruct the Government of India to inform the Sultan accordingly. The attention of Messrs. Russell and Arnholz will doubtless be called, as proposed in your letter of the 4th May, to the fact that the Muscat Concession is for 15 years only and does not grant an exclusive right to fish for sponges. _ The Persian Concession, it is observed, is for 50 years and grants exclusive rights. As regards the question raised in your letter of 4th May last, No. 13,603, whether it might not be desirable, since it is impracticable to procure the cancellation of the concessions, to encourage British capital to take them up in order to obviate the danger of their falling into the hands of foreigners, I am to refer to my letter of the 29th May last.

Grey to inform you that a report on the subject has been received from the Government of India. I am in the first place to explain that there was found to be an important discrepancy between the wording of the translation of t e concession forwarded by you in your letter of 3rd May, and that w ic had already reached this Department through the India Office, and o± which a copy is enclosed herewith, for whereas the preamble of the latter only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the permission to produce sponges from his waters, that of your version declares that he “ leases ” to them the “ sea of his Kingdoms ” for this purpose. If the latter were the correct translation of the Arabic text the concession would grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat waters during the period of the lease, and would, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, constitute a violation of Article IV. of the treaty between Great Britain and Muscat of 19th July 1891, which forbids the establishment of any kind of monoply or exclusive privilege of trade in the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat. The Government of India, having now compared both versions with the original text, have declared their own version to be the correct one, so that the concession is not open to objection on this score. With regard, however, to the statement contained in the preamble of both versions alike that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to a distance of 10 miles in breadth, I am to point out that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the Sultan of Muscat to confer such a privilege outside the territorial waters and over high seas situated between 3 and 10 miles from the coast, and that it is proposed to make a communication in this sense to the Sultan. I am to add that if the syndicate or company formed to work the concession—subject, of course, to the above-mentioned limitations—is able to satisfy His Majesty’s Government that it is a bond fide British undertaking and is satisfactorily constituted, and that it is willing to respect the rights of the Arab tribes in the pearl fisheries, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to assure it of their due support in the legitimate exploitation of its concession.

Hatinoglou, the representative of the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, had been dining with him the evening before aSd ''hi e . discoursing expansively on the bright prospects of his Syndicate had explained that their present concession dealt specially with sponges but that it was expected as a matter of course, that the acquisition of pearl-fishing privi- leges would lollow in due course. r Under these circumstances, Mr. Malcolm said that he had come to remind me of the old concession which he, with a reputable British Syndicale at his bach, had practically acquired from the Persian Government, but of which Colonel Ross had managed to procure the withdrawal by means of pressure applied upon the Persian Government at Tehran. He remarked that his treatment by the Residency in regard to this matter had alwavs remained a sore point with him, but that it was an old story now, and he did* not wish to trouble me w ith it, what hn desired to say was that he believed he was still in a position to form a powerful syndicate of British merchants, and to secure the grant of a similar concession to that which he had succeeded in obtainino- before. He continued that, in view of the change of conditions brought about by the Hatinoglou concession, he hoped that His Majesty’s Government might he prepared to modify their attitude in his favour, and that, as he learnt that I was proceeding to Simla, he had come to ask me to “sound ” the Government of India on the subject. 3. In reply, I said that he, Mr. Malcolm, was, I knew, aware of the, altitude which the British Government had always maintained in regard to the Gulf Pearl Fisheries, and that I had no reason to think that the Sponge Syndicate’s concession had caused them to modify that attitude, but that I would not fail to lay his representation before the Government of India. The history of Mr. Malcolm’s former negotiations of 1890 is on the records of the Foreign Department, having been communicated under Bushire Resi- + Fro. No. 358 in Secret E , June 1894, Nos. 351- dency letter No. 32,f dated 21st April 36 °- 1894, and I need do no more than refer to that correspondence. 4. With such a weak syndicate to deal with as that which Mons. Hatinoglou represents, I always felt that a possible and convenient course would have been to have procured the withdrawal botii of the Maskat and Persian concessions the moment we heard of them. I am afraid, however, that they must now be regarded as accomplished facts, and indeed the Persian concession has already excited a good deal of notice and comment in official circles in Bushire, and probably in other ports, owing to the uncertainty which exists as to whether this Syndicate, at one time reported to be “ British ” and at another “ Greek ”, does or does not give cover to some mysterious political move on the part of Great Britain in the Gulf. In any case, there can he no doubt that the existence of this concession considerably alters the aspect of the Pearl Fishery question and of our position in regard thereto.5. The problem involved is such a far-reaching one that I hesitate to make any very decided recommendation as to the action which can best he taken on Mr. Malcolm's representation. My own inclination would be _ to temporise for a few weeks, or months, on the grounds that, during the coming pearling season, matters will probably develop, and we shall seewhat success the Sponge Syndicate have with their venture. Meanwhile, Mr. Malcolm might be informed that the question raised by him has been referred to His Majesty s Government for consideration. The capital at the command of the Sponge Syndicate is apparently very small, and if their initial operations are not profitable, they may retire from the scene, and we may still stave off the issue for some time to come. If, however, they succeed in establishing themselves on a profitable basis, then the danger is that foreign commercial or political representatives, seeing that the Sponge Syndicate has successfully broken the ice and is pursuing its operations unhindered, will be quick to take advantage of the fact and to look out for openings for themselves. In such circumstances it would be necessary for us to consider the advisability of furthering the ambition of Mr. Malcolm to secure a pearl-fishing concession before any foreigner gets a footing. He, perhaps, has first claim on us, in view of his previous concession, and could probably form a much more reputable British Syndicate than that by which Mons. Hatinoglou is supported. I solicit early instructions as to what reply to make to him.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLET, O.M., His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 23 rd August 1906. Sm, ^ t0 the correspondence ending with your telegram dated the 28th February 1906, we have the honour to forward a cony of letter No. 1367 A., dated the 25th June 1906, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the pearl fisheries on the Persian shore, together with an extract from the diary of the Political Resident in the Persian°Gulf, which shows that the Sponge Exploration Syndicate was at the end of June about to begin work at Hormuz. 2. In our Secret despatch No. 63 (External), dated the 10th March 1904, we acquainted His Majesty’s Government with our views concerning the pearling grounds on the Arabian side of the Gulf; and in your predecessor’s Secret despatch No. 8, dated 31st March 1905, we were informed of the opinion of the Law officers of the Crown on the subject. The movements of M. Hatinoglou and his Syndicate have now rendered it necessary to consider the question of the Persian shore also. 3. ^ The pearl banks on the Persian shore extend from Kharak to Lingah, and, with one or two exceptions, are generally regarded as open to all the maritime tribes of the Gulf. As was explained by Lieutenant-Colonel Meade 1 »rfe Secret despatch from Government of India, in his letter No. 74, dated 5th March No. 4,2 (External), dated the 29th March 1900 . 1900, they are visited by boats f rom the Arabian as well as the Persian shores, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees to the local Persian officials or to the territorial magnates of the districts to which they belong. The Persian banks, though not as lucrative as the Arabian, form a valuable asset to their owners and have been several times sought after by foreign capitalists. In 1882, Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh (the Shah’s Minister of Telegraphs) in partnership with the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., obtained a concession in Persian territorial waters and searched some of the banks near Lingah and the island of Kharak, but the venture proved a failure. In 1890, attempts appear to have been made by the Mr. Malcolm referred to in the Resident’s letter, and by several others, to secure exclusive rights of fishing from the Persian Government, but without success. In 1894, Mr. Malcolm applied for British support towards * India Office to Foreign Office, dated the 4th a renewal Ol negotiations, but WUS informed'^ July 1894 . jyr j s Majesty’s Government were unable to comply with his request. In 1898, MM. Sunye and Hagens secureda concession, but before they ^ ^ wor^ sSSSS-^ SK*^Ar/c rifflits of Chiefs under British protection. All attempts by foreigners to exploit the Persian pearl-banks bare thus been hitherto unsuccessful. 0 .. 4. The concession now granted to the Sponge Exploration Syndica e, though ostensibly limited to the exploitation of sponges, does not, like the Maskat concession, provide that an overseer shall watch operations on behalf of the Persian Government, and that all produce, except sponges, shall become the property of the latter. The absence of this safeguard, together wi h the statement attributed to M. Hatinoglou that the Syndicate expect pearl- fishing privileges, warrants the belief that such privileges will shortly be either openly granted or tacitly connived at; and as the extent of the Persian banks and the rights therein of the Arab tribes under our protection are alike undefined, this might lead to grave complications. Another difficulty would be that the Persian Government do not possess the means either of keeping the conces sionaires from transgressing the limits of their territorial waters, or of pre venting conflicts with the local Chiefs, and that additional patrol duties would thus be entailed on His Majesty’s ships stationed in the Gulf. 5. In these circumstances, we would venture to suggest that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran should be instructed to warn the Persian Government of the probability that the Sponge Syndicate will apply for or assume the right to fish for pearls and to deprecate in anticipation any open or tacit amplification of the sponge concession.

Paddison, Trevor, and De La Chapelle, who are acting as solicitors to that association, forwarding a translation of the concession granted by the Sultan of Muscat, and soliciting a declaration from His Majesty’s Government that the terms of this document, in no way infringe the rights of other persons protected by the commercial 'treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, and that His Majesty’s Government recognise the concession as being perfectly in order. A comparison of the translation forwarded herewith with that of the same concession which formed the enclosure in your letter of 11th January 1906 reveals the existence of an important discrepancy bettveen the twm, viz., that whereas the preamble of the India Office version only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the “ permission to produce sponges from ” his “ vraters,” that of Messrs. Paddison’s version It appears to Sir E. Grey that, if the translation of the concession now given by Messrs. Paddison rightly reproduces the sense of the original text, that instrument does, in fact, grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat w r aters during the period of the lease, and thereby constitutes a violation of the Treaty above referred to. I am accordingly to request that, should Mr. Secretary Moriey see no objection, steps may be taken to ascertain from the Government of India, vlio are understood to he in possession of a copy of the original test of this concession, which translation is the correct one, and I am to inquire whether, should it be shown that Messrs. Paddison’s version is accurate, this discovery would not modify the opinion expressed in your letter of 7th February 1906, that the concession cannot be held to be a violation of Article IV. of the Treaty of 1891. I am further to draw your attention to the passage common to both versions of the preamble, in which it is stated that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to the Syndicate to a distance of ten miles in breadth, and I am to state that, in Sir E.

Spring-Rice to Foreign Office. No. 76. Tehran. Sir, 23rd April 1907. In my Despatch No. 275 of 7th November last, I had the honour to tiansmit to you copy of a note which I had addressed to the Persian Government warning them that the concession which they had recently granted for sponge fishing in the Persian Gulf might be abused, and that any amplification of it which might interfere with the pearl fishery in those waters would be likely to raise serious difficulties. I now have the honour to transmit further correspondence which has passed between the Persian Foreign Office and this Legation on the subject. You will see from the Ala es Sultaneh’s note of the 19th ultimo that the Persian Government deny that the Sponge Syndicate are authorised to interfere in any vray with the pearl fishery in the Gulf. As the concession to the National Bank contained a clause giving the Bank the right of exploiting the Persian pearl fisheries, I considered it would be prudent to enter a renewed caveat as to the rights acquired by British protected Arabs, by way of lease. I explained verbally to the Foreign Minister the purpose of my note, and he assured me that, according to Mahommedan law, due respect would be paid to acquired rights in any concession made to the National Bank or any other institution.

Spring Rice. 19th March 1907. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of 20thExploration Concession. In reply to your note, and for your information, I have the honour to state that no right whatever has been given by the Persian Government to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate foi peail fishery. If the Syndicate is carrying on any operation it is in connection with the sponge fishery. The Syndicate has so far not applied for, noi has the Persian Government thought of, granting the right of fishing for pearls. If any information with regard to this matter has reached the British Government, the Persian Government has none. If such a measure has been taken by the Chiefs, or if the British Government has discovered that they have taken such a measure, I ‘request that the Persian Government may be notified, in order that the necessary inquiries may be made, and, if proved to be true, steps for its prevention may be taken. You stated in your note under reply that “ the pearl banks on the “ Persian shore are visited by boats from the coasts of Arabia as well as “ Persia, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees “ to the local authorities.” You also referred to your note of the 18th June 1900. As I do not properly understand your object in making this state ment I cannot give a reply. But when you state in this connection that “ any infraction of those rights would inevitably lead to grave compli- “ cations which both Governments wish to avoid,” I have no doubt you will consider me justified in expressing surprise, for the Persian Government have always on important occasions given, and will give, proof of their desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two States, and they will never permit British subjects to suffer in their legal interests, not speaking of matters of no importance, with regard to which the Persian Government do not understand why the British Government take the trouble of making representations. Annex 3. Sir C. Spring Rice to Ala es Sultaneh. 3rd April 1907. I beg to thank you for your note of the 19th instant about the Sponge Concession. object in writing was to prevent any incident arising owing to misapprehension which could disturb our friendly relations. When tv-o people aie friends, it is, as you know, their custom not to wait until a difficulty arises, in order to speak as to their rights. If they think that a difficulty is likely to arise, their custom is to warn each other beforehand _ in a friendly way in order that by timely action a difficulty may be avoided according to the verse “ a stitch in time saves nine ” and “prevention is better than cure.” I he peail fisheries in the Persian Gulf are of course, as far as they are within the waters which belong to Persia, Persian property and no one will ever dispute these rights. But the rights have in some places been leased by the local Persian authorities to Arabs, some of whom are under British protection. If these leases are suddenly altered and amiuUed the Arabs wd! of course complain, and make difficulties, and these difficulties would cause difficulties between our two Governments. omnnTn • t ° j V 01C 1 tliese difficulties I wrote you the letter of 20th October in order that you might know what people say who are in the Persian Gulf namely, that Arabs living on the Arab coast have contracts giving them the right to fish for pearls in waters belonffing to Persia which have been given them lawfully by the local Persian Governors, and that these contracts are good and valid and cannot be I said this for two reasons, one, because our Governments are friends and because it is better for us to warn each other beforehand of anyEnclosure No. 7.

Mr Morley agrees generally in the view of the Government of India that, if the enterprise is likely to he successful, the larger the share . ntish capital has m the concern the better it will be, though he thinks it will be desirable not to commit ourselves till further information has been obtained from Messrs. Russell and Arnholz as to the constitution of the Board of Management. Before, however, any action is taken it seems necessary to clear up the question raised in your letter of the 15th May, No. 14,782, as to the exact nature and scope of the Muscat Concession. A copy of that letter, with its enclosures, has been sent out to the Government of India, who have been asked to telegraph their views as soon as possible.

As to wirue of the sponge beds either on the Persian or Arabian we have no infor mation at all; nor, as regards sponges reported to have been sent home by Wonkhaus —vide enclosure to our letter of 11th April,—have we been able to ascertain the result of examination in Germany. We consider that, if Syndicate has proof of existence of profitable sponge beds, the more British capital embarked in the venture the better. We may point out that it may be possible for us, if necessary, to induce the Sultan to refuse foreign companies admission on the Arabian shore, seeing that syndicates are given no power of alienation under Muscat Concession. Enclosure ISlo. 8 . India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 16th July 1907. In continuation of my letter of the 29th May, on the subject of the concessions granted to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate by the Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose, to be submitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of * Dated 7th July 1907 (sent to Foreign teWram* from the Yicerov Office 8th July). a telegram irom tne \ iceroy, stating that the translation ol the Muscat Concession forwarded with the letter from this Office of the 11th January 1906 is correct. The Muscat Concession is thus not open to the objections based on the translation furnished by the Concessionnaires which were expressed in your letter of the 15th May, No. 14,782. But as regards the per mission to fish for sponges “ to a distance of 10 miles in breadth,” to which attention was called in that letter, it will be seen that the Government of India agree that the Syndicate and the Sultan of Muscat should be informed that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the latter to confer such a privilege beyond the limit of Muscat territorial waters ; and Mr. Morley proposes to instruct the Government of India to inform the Sultan accordingly. Ihe attention of Messrs. Russell and Arnholz will doubtless be called, as proposed, in your letter of the 4th May, to the fact that the Muscat Concession is for 15 years only and does not grant an exclusive right to fish for sponges. The Persian Concession, it is observed, is for 50 years and grants exclusive rights. As regards the question raised in your letter of 4 th May last, No. 15,605, whether it might not be desirable, since it is impracticable to proeme the cancellation of the concessions, to encourage British capital to take them up in order to obviate the danger of their falling into the hands of foreigners, I am to refer to my letter of the 29th May last. If the Company formed to work the concession is found to be satisfactorily constituted, and to be willing to respect the policy of non-mterference with the rights of the Arab tribes in the pearl fisheries, on which stress was laid in the Viceroy’s telegram of 22nd May,- ,1 V 11 1 -. pi Ain Morley would suggest that t ey should be assured of due support by His Majesty’s Government in tne legitimate exploitation of their concessions. mi tt n o I &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A.

I am in the first place to explain that there was found to be an important discrepancy between the wording of the translation of the concession forwarded by you in your letter of 3rd May, and that which had already reached this Department through the India Office, and of which a copy is enclosed herewith, for whereas the preamble of the latter only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the permission to produce sponges from his waters, that of your version declares that he “ leases ” to them the “ sea of his Kingdoms ” for this purpose. If fihp, latter were the correct translation of the Arabic text the concession would grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat waters during the period of the lease, and would, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, constitute a violation of Article IV. of the treaty between Great Britain and Muscat of 19th July 1891, which forbids the establishment of any kind of monoply or exclusive privilege of trade in the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat. The Government of India, having now compared both versions with the original text, have declared their own version to be the correct one, so that the concession is not open to objection on this score. With regard, however, to the statement contained in the preamble of both versions alike that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to a distance of 10 miles in breadth, I am to point out that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the Sultan of Muscat to confer such a privilege outside the territorial waters and over high seas situated between 3 and 10 miles from the coast, and that it is proposed to make a communication in this sense to the Sultan.

My object in ^Triting v,ras to prevent any incid ent arising o-'ing to m isaopreheneion which could disturb, our friendly relations. When two people t.re friends, it is, as you lenow, their custom not to wait until a difficulty arises, in order to speak as to their rights. If they think that a difficulty is likely to arise, their custom is to warn each other beforehand in a friendly way in order that by timely action e difficulty may be avoided according to the ..j verse 'a stitch in bime saves nine’* end 'prevention is better than cure”. The Pearl Fisheries in the Persian Gulf are of course as far as they are within the waters which belong r to Persia, Persian property, and no one will eve# dispute these rights. But the right® have in some places been leased by the local Persian authorities bo Arabs, some of shorn are under .British protection. If these leases ere suddenly altered and annulled the Arabs will of course complain end make difficulties and these 1 ifficur-d.es would cause diff iculties between our two Governments• In order to avoid these difficulties I wrote you the letter of October SO in order that you might know what people say who are in the Persian Gulf, namely that Arabs living on the Arab Coast have contracts giving them the right to fish for pearls, in waters belonging to Persia which have been given them lawfully by uhe local Persian Governors» and that these contracts: are good and valid and cannot be cancelled without compensation. Itwo reasons, one because our Govern- ments are friends and because it is h-tten xu xto o^uoer lor us to warn eacn other beforehand of anv ii-r-p-? , . w ^i^ficulty which is likely oo arise than to quarrel after the iit-r-ff - cxxoen one difficulty has arisen.;- th6 ° Uner that b0tl1 governments are just and when they see what is just they do not refrain from doing it As you eay / neither government would admit that the subjects 01 ^ ° ther ° r lts own subjects should suffer in their legal interests.: In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote ,1:3603.

'While the divers were in the Gulf I was at pains to keep myself in formed as far as possible in regard to their movements, and in view of further details since received, of which I append the purport, I feel sure that the deputation of a Government vessel at this stage to enquire into their unobtru sive operations would not result in the acquisition of any more complete or scientifically valuable details than those which are now to hand. 3. In view of the uncertainty which at present attaches to the subject and of the intrinsic importance of the Sponge fishing industry generally in the view of the British Museum Authorities, I venture to hope that, when a con venient juncture arises, the Government of India will entertain the precau tionary measure of setting existing doubts at rest by means of organised scien tific investigation. Owing to the excessively hot weather at Ormuz, the divers could only work for about 18 hours during the time they were in those localities. On their return to Bushire, they tried Kharag with no brilliant results. I am, however, informed that there was much disagreement and bad blood between Hatinoglou and Captain Demetri who was guiding the operations of six Greek divers, and it is alleged that it was on account of this disagreement that the diving operations proved a failure and the divers dilly dallied with their work until the expiry of the period of their contract, when they insisted upon leaving. Captain Demetri was a Spongologist and he told me that there were many places in the Gulf full of sponges, good, bad and^ indifferent qualities, of all which he had gathered specimens. It was his opinion that he could enlarge the fields of the good sorts by cultivation so as to be ready for harvesting in three or four years’ time. HatinoMou himself was very sanguine of ultimate success and told me that ids object in going to Europe was to arrange with a Syndicate for return ing with the best equipment for operations.

The specimens represent a Monaxon silicious sponge, probably a variety of Ealichondria panicea, a widely distributed and common species. Sponges of this kind differ from the bath sponge (Euspongia officinalis) as regards the structure of their skeleton and are therefore of no commercial value. Where as in the bath sponge the skeleton is made of the soft but strong and tenaceous substance known as spongin ; in these silicious sponges it is largely formed of numerous minute sharp spicules of silica bound together by a thin deposit of spongin. The spongin skeleton of Euspongia is the bath sponge of commerce, the living substance of the animal having been removed. So far as it is possible to say, sponges such as the specimens submitted do no harm to any commercial product or artificial structure. The true bath sponge occurs in the Indian seas, notably in Mergui and the Andaman Archipelago. Whether it could he fished with commercial success or not depends on a number of biological and environmental factors which could only be investigated in situ. These factors include the depths in which it is found, the size of the individual sponges, their rate of growth, powers of recuperation after injury, methods of reproduction, etc.1907 SIMLA.

At the same time the ship would be just as available for any urgent cable work that might occur as she would be if lying in harbour at Karachi. I may add that the “ Patrick Stewart v is so well known in the Gulf that her presence would create little or no attention. .

In our Secret despatch No. 63 (External), dated the 10th March 1904, we acquainted His Majesty’s Government with our views concerning the pearling grounds on the Arabian side of the Gulf; and in your predecessor’s Secret despatch No. 8 , dated 31st March 1905, we were informed of the opinion of the Law officers of the Crown on the subject. The movements of M. Hatinoglou and his Syndicate have now rendered it necessary to consider the question of the Persian shore also. 3 . The pearl banks on the Persian shore extend from Eharak to Lingah, and, with one or two exceptions, are generally regarded as open to all the maritime tribes of the Gulf. As was explained by Lieutenant-Colonel Meade Vide Secret despatch from Government of India, his lettei No. 74, dated 5th March No. 4a (External), dated the 29ti» March 1900 . 1900, they are visited by boats from the Arabian as well as the Persian shores, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees to the local Persian officials or to the territorial magnates of the districts to which they belong. The Persian banks, though not as lucrative as the Arabian, form a valuable asset to their owners and have been several times sought after by foreign capitalists. In 1882, M ukhbir-ed-Dowleh (the Shah’s Minister of Telegraphs) in partnership with the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., obtained a concession in Persian territorial waters and searched some of the banks near Lingah and the island of Kharak, but the venture proved a failure. In 1890, attempts appear to have been made by the Mr. Malcolm referred to in the Resident s letter, and by several others, to secure exclusive rights of fishing from the Persian Government, but without success.

Hatinoglou, the representative of the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, had been dining with him^ the evening beforef and while_ discoursing expansively on the bright prospects of his Syndicate had explained that their present concession dealt specially with sponges but thatit was expeeted as a matter of course, that the acquisition of pearhfishing privF leges would follow in due course. &amp; Under these circumstances, Mr. Malcolm said that he had come to remind me of the old concession which he, with a reputable British Syndicate at his hack, had practically acquired from the Persian Government, but of which Colonel Ross had managed to procure the withdrawal by means of pressure applied upon the Persian Government at Tehran. He remarked that his treatment by the Residency in regard to this matter had always remained a sore point with him, but that it was an old story now, and he did not wish to trouble me with it; tvhat he desired to say was that he believed he was still in a position to form a powerful syndicate of British merchants, and to secure the grant of a similar concession to that which he had succeeded in obtaining before. ° He continued that, in view of the change of conditions brought about by the Hatinoglou concession, he hoped that His Majesty’s Government mio'hfc be prepared to modify their attitude in his favour, and that, as he learnt that I was proceeding to Simla, he had come to ask me to “sound ” the Government of India on the subjecr. 3. In reply, I said that he, Mr. Malcolm, was, I knew, aware of the attitude which the British Government had always maintained in regard to the Gulf Pearl Pishcries, and that I had no reason to think that the Sponge Syndicate’s concession had caused them to modify that attitude, but that &amp; I would not fail to lay his representation before the Government of India. The history of Mr. Malcolm’s former negotiations of 1890 is on the records of the Foreign Department, having been communicated under Bushire Resi- + Pro. No. 358 in Secret E., June 1894, Nos. 351- dency letter No. 32,f dated 21st April 360 - 1894, and I need do no more than refer to that correspondence. 4. With such a weak syndicate to deal with as that which Mons. Hatinoglou represents, I always felt that a possible and convenient course would have been to have procured the withdrawal both of the Maskat and Persian concessions the moment we heard of them. I am afraid, however, that they must now be regarded as accomplished facts, and indeed the Persian concession has already excited a good deal of notice and comment in official circles in Bushire, and probably in other ports, owing to the uncertainty which exists as to whether this Syndicate, at one time reported to be “ British ” and at another “ Greek ”, does or does not give cover to some mysterious political move on the part of Great Britain in the Gulf. In any case, there can be no doubt that the existence of this concession considerably alters the aspect of the Pearl Fishery question and of our position in regard thereto.2 5 The problem involved is such &amp; far-reselling one tost 1 hesitate to make any very decided recommendation as to the action which can best he taken on Mr. Malcolm’s representation. My own inclination would he to temporise for a few weeks, or months, on the grounds that, during the coming pearling season, matters will probably develop, and we shall se e wl &gt;at success the Sponge Syndicate have with their venture. Meanwhile, Mr. Malcolm might be informed that the question raised by him has been referred to His Majesty s Government for consideration. The capital at the command of the Sponge Syndicate is apparently very small, and if their initial operations are not profitable, they may retire from the scene, and we may still stave off the issue for some time to come. If however, they succeed in establishing themselves on a profitable basis, then the danger is that foreign commercial or political representatives, seeing that the Sponge Syndicate has successfully broken the ice and is pursuing its operations unhindered, will be quick to take advantage of the fact and to look out for openings for themselves. In such circumstances it would be necessary for us to consider the advisability of furthering the ambition of Mr. Malcolm to secure a pearl-fishing concession before any foreigner gets a footing. He, perhaps, has first claim on us in view of his previous concession, and could probably form a much more reputable British Syndicate than that by which Mons. Hatmoglou is supported. I solicit early instructions as to what reply to make to him.

Dear Sir Louis, Kindly reTor to the papers forwarded to me under Foreign Department endorsement Ho.1009-B/B., dated 3rd instant, in which was communicated the decision arrived at Dy His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Concession granted to the Sponge Syndicate by the Sultan of Kaskat. 1 do not presume to question the correctness oi the deliberate view of the Secretary of state and his legal advisers that, the Concession having once been given, we must accept it as an inconvenient fact, and have not sufficient constitutional grounds for causing it to be annulled. The same considerations apply to the Persian Concession, which was first understood here to have been acquired by a 'Greek' Concern but which I have lately learnt also figures in the name of the British Syndicate though the Kushir-ed-Dowleh is pleased to call it the ’Greek Sponge Exploiting Company'. Clearly the only thing to be done now is for us to watch the effect of the operations upon which the Syndicate are now embarking in pursuance of their Persian Concession, and this i will not neglect to do. Meanwhile there are one or two aspects of the question which oeexfj hardly worthwhile reporting officially, but of which I should like you to have personal cognizance.As regards the liaskat Concession, I suspect that it was obtained chiefly with the idea that the production of it by natinoglou before Arab Sheikhs further north would facili tate the acquisition from them of similar Concessions covering the waters of the Gulf as far as Bahrein , admittedly one of the main objectives of the Syndicate and probably the chief one. The Sheikhs concerned having been duly warned, a fact ol which Hatinoglou must have heard through his Agents, the Syndicate will no doubt let Maskat waters alone for the present, as being lessfiikely to afiord a lucrative prospect ing ground and ?vrill confine their energies to the exploit ation of waters covered by their Tehran Concession. The ilaskat Concession in itself I do not regard as of much individual importance ; I objected to it rather from the fear of what it would open the way to. ±nit in case it should, later on, come into evidence On its separate merits, I fear that the first condition of it, relied upon by the Secretary of State in the correspondence under reference, would prove of little or no help to us, owing to the fact that we should not, i imagine, have the co-operation of the Sultan, seeing that strict observance of the condition would be opposed to his personal interests. I think it may be taken for granted that in a matter like this His Kighnesr Seyyid Faisal would not be prompteddeep-laid scheme on the part of the British Uovemnent. ion may perhaps think me ultra nervous over this matter and I hope this may prove to be the case, but 1 must admit that at present l have instinctive apprehensions that the Concessions will bring us trouble, and think that I shall be erring on the right side if I impart then to you persoa- ally* Yours sincerely, S&amp;.

There is no definite information in literature concerning the existence of commercial sponges in the Persian Gulf; and, although the Natural History Museum possesses specimens of horny sponges from that region, some of which were collected by the writer of this Report in the course of a voyage from Basra to Karachi, there are among them no typical commercial sponges. In spite of this negative evidence, which is of small importance, it is very probable that commercial sponges do exist in great abundance in certain localities in the Gulf, especially, for instance, on the extensive pearl oyster beds. The fact that there has hitherto been no trade in sponges from the Persian Gulf is no proof against their existence. Previous to 1840 the sponge trade of the West Indian region did not exist, and its origin at that date was due to an accident; now thousands of men are employed in the industry. The Persian Gulf, or “the Green Sea,” is a shallow enclosed sea, the depth of which rarely exceeds 55 fathoms. Numerous islands and shallows occur in its south-western portion and near the entrance to the Straits of ‘Ormuz. The bottom is formed of mud, clay, sand, and rocks, the last two ■being favourable ground for sponge growth. Outside the Gulf and along the coast of Muscat, the 10-fathom line extends out several miles from the shore; and beyond this line the great depths are reached. Conditions Favourable to the Growth of Commercial Sponges. These sponges flourish in warm temperate and tropical waters in depths of from 10 to 30 fathoms, though their bathymetrical range is from 2 to 70 fathoms. They grow best on rocks and reefs in currents of three or four knots an hour. Too strong currents cause the growth to be irregular. Unfavourable Conditions that might Prevent Successfid Sponge Pishing in the Persian Gulf. Mud is obnoxious to most sponges. There is no likelihood of commercial sponges being abundant in the northern end of the Gulf, where the diluvium brought by the Shat-el-Arab is being deposited. The “ Shamal,” or Dust-wind, a north-west wind that fills the air for days together with dust from the plains of Mesopotamia, would probably be rather detrimental to certain forms of submarine life, for the impalpable sand and dust fall on to the water, and are partly suspended and partly sink to the bottom. Lastly, occasionally the temperature may be too great for healthy sponge life. An air temperature of 179° Fahr. has been recorded on the Muscat coast; this would give rise to a water temperature nearly as high {i.e., within 33 ° Fahr. of boiling water) in shallow water of only a few fathoms depth. S. 33.At the sponge fishing grounds of Florida, the highest air temperature during the two years 1895—6 reached 88'58 Fahr., the water temperature on the same date being 86 * 58° Fahr. Probably the temperature on the Bahrein Banks never attains so great a height as that recorded from the Muscat coast where local conditions, such as encircling rocks, may have contributed to the reaching of such a record as that given above. Methods of Obtaining Sponges. The methods of sponge fishing vary with the local traditions and circum stances, the depth being one of the chief of these latter. Sponges are obtained in four different ways :— (1.) By naked divers who descend, with the aid of a heavy stone, to depths up to 10 fathoms. The men can remain under from two to three minutes, the last period being almost the outside limit of endurance. The sponges are cut from their attachment and hastily gathered into a basket, the diver then being hauled up to the surface. [The Bahrein pearl fishers, who usually descend in about 10 fathoms, go down feet first, and remain under about two minutes. They close the nostrils with a small clip resembling a clothes-peg, to prevent the entry of water.] (2.) By means of divers in diving dresses. Where capital is available, the catch is greatly increased by employing diving dresses. A diver in dress can remain under water up to depths of 10 fathoms for a long period, but in greater depths of 20 fathoms he can only stay under for a few minutes. Both in the Mediterranean and West Indies the native population is usually hostile to the users of diving dresses. (3.) By means of forks with a very long stem or handle and two or three prongs. This method is employed in Dalmatia and all over the West Indies, and is available in depths of 5 to 8 fathoms, in clear water. In the West Indies (Florida, Bahamas, &amp;c.) a schooner-rigged vessel of several tons will take several small dinghies on board, and a crew, allowing two men to each dinghy. When a suitable reef is reached the boats are put out. While one of the two men very gently sculls the other inspects the bottom through a submarine telescope or a pane of glass let into the bottom of a bucket. The object of tins is to do away with the effect of surface ripples. When the man sees the black sponge on the bottom he transfixes it with the fork, which may be over 30 feet in length. Great skill is required to operate successfully without damaging the sponge too much. (4.) By means of dredge nets usually made of camel’s hair, and fitted with an iron frame at the mouth. The dredge is worked from a sailing ship, and in considerable depths of from 50 to 70 fathoms, where the other three methods would be unavailable. The dredge can be used in lesser depths, but would be injurious to pearl oyster beds. Would it be possible for a syndicate to collect sponges without at the same time bringing up oysters or damaging their beds ? The collecting of sponges on the Pearl Oyster Banks would be likely to cause some damage at certain seasons, when the young oysters wouldtem’ itiin lejf '•mil 1111,1 ciltlln, V?f5»e J stout, It uplotln in akiit about t?j is bases, [ ’01 b can oiilf ro or tkee t the West earfoteF, iner-rif' hoaFiasI itable reef mea ?eij suhmarioe kt ;e rippM traasta 7ecaiibf IF be injured by beiiiff trodden upon Ff +1 in a dress, or booking were employed the * ^ n ^ ° f naked divin ^ 5 divin S up oysters to the surface. ’ 16 W ° U ^ be n ° danger of Ringing It is probable that the. local triW ^ i syndicate working on the Pearl Oyster Banks 6 , eXtr ®' lely hostile to an . v that it was to their interest to co operate wiih tl 7 7 ™ r COnvinced fisheries occupy about 30,000 men and 5 000 1 e syndicate.

Legislation enforces a close period in Tunis from 1 st March to 1 st June. Summary and Conclusion. The writer of this Report is unable to state definitely whether or not rich beds of commercial sponges exist in the Persian Gulf and along the Muscat coast; but he is of opinion that many of the conditions requisite for the Healthy Me of such sponges occur there. The sponge harvest is, perhaps, the most profitable of all marine harvests and the price of sponges in the market appears to be continually increasing.’ In view of the increasing demand of the world for sponges and of the diminishing supply, sponge fisheries have now become a most valuable asset; accordingly, if sponge grounds are present to any extent in the Persian Gulf, a syndicate would stand a very good chance of success.

Dear Sir Thomas Sanderson I regret that I am unable to learn any thing regarding the members ol the ”Sponge Explora tion Syndicate” further than what was registered at Somerset House on 1st February last.

Another concession I believe granted about 1898 to tv/o Spanish and Belgian sub jects, but I do not think anything came of it either, I have never heard of Sponges being procured in the Persian Gulf. The real object of this Syndicate I take it is to exploit the Pearl Banks. If this Syndicate’s operations are restricted to Persian Waters little harm may be done, but any attempts on the Arab coast would probably lead to trouble.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,—■ copy. 39 , DUKE STREET, St. MARY AXE, LONDON, E.G. 24th October, 1905. Sir:- I beg leave to inform Your Lordship that on the 22nd May and 28th June last this Company had the honour of addressing to you two petitions praying for a Concession to be granted to us by His Majesty*s Government for fishing and exploiting Sponges in the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian as well as on the Per sian sides. The petitions referred to above were addressed to Your Lordship in conformity with the advice given to our representative at Bushire by His Majesty's Consul General residing at that place, as per copy I herewith annexed. * fe* By two letters from Your Lordship, dated June f. &amp; 13th and August 3rd last, and addressed to this Com pany, we were informed that His Majesty's Government could His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.could not grant any Concessions, first because they held the view that dredging for Sponges would of necessity interfere with the rights of fishing al ready exercised by the Arab tribes with whom His Majesty’s Government have relations, and secondly as regards the Arabian Coast north of Bahrein and the Persian side of the Gulf, His Majesty’s Govern ment have no power to grant concessions as they claim no right of jurisdiction there. In the face of the above communications, our Company, in order to safeguard their interests, thought it advisable to petition His Imperial Majes ty, the Shah of Persia as regards the Persian side of the Gulf. Accordingly a Concession was granted by the Government of Persia to our Company giving us the exclusive rights of fishing for Sponges from Pao in the Persian Gulf to Gwaddar in the Indian Ocean, for a period of fifty years. As the extent of the Company’s discoveries of SpongesSponges includes also the waters of the whole coast of Oman from Merhat or Kooria. Mooria up to and in cluding the Bahrein Islands, we find it most neces- savy in order to protect our interests, to seek to obtain the privilege of exclusive fishery on these coasts also, hut as His Majesty’s Government could grant no such privilege for the reasons before stated, the only alternative for this Company to take, has been to instruct our representative in the Persian Gulf to proceed to Muscat, and there meet the Chiefs of the Tribes, and arrange with them a private treaty with respect to their Sponge fishery. We presume that Your Lordship will have no ob jection to make to the course we have taken, seeing that if we do not acquire this privilege, some other individual or Company will surely obtain the same, to the detriment of the legal rights of the discovery of this Company, which is a British Concern, and it must be in the interests of British prestige to have an industry developed in these v/aters by British Capital. WeWe have telegraphic information that our repre sentative is now at Muscat, and on behalf of this Company, I humbly beg of Your Lordship that His Majesty's Consul at Muscat be instructed to afford our said representative all the assistance and pro tection that British interests require.

Sir:- At our interview some days ago you informed me that the British firm known as The Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited, 39, Duke Street, St. Mary Axe, London, E.C. had given you a roving commission to obtain for them a concession in these waters or elsewhere for ”the exclusive right to fish for and take as their own property sponges, corals and all undersea produce suitable for commercial purposes”. You asked my help and advice in the direction of securing such a concession. I now have the pleasure to confirm the reply which I gave you then, namely, that so far as these waters are concerned the most expeditious course for the Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited to pursue in f Monsieur Mishel Hatinoglou,in the first instance will he to address themselves fully on the subject either to His Majesty’s Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs or His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, who will no doubt con* i sider what can be done to further their interests.

I told him that I could readily give him a promise as regards the second point, but that without specific instructions,^ I could not pledge Government to any particular course of action, though this would doubtless he what was most appropriate to each occasion as it arose. 3. As the agreement of 22nd December 1880, signed by the Chief of Bahrain, contained no provision against a disposal of territory, I thought it desirable to obtain a document to that effect from him, and thus complete the series for the whole coast. The Sheikh preferred one identical in terms with that signed by the Trucial Chiefs to a declaration in a single article, and it has, therefore, been executed in that form, though the first two clauses are really superfluous in his case. I trust that my action in this respect will meet with approval. I, Zaeed bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, in the presence of Lieutenant- Colonel A. C. Talbot, C.I.E., Political Besident, Persian Gulf, do hereby solemnly hind myself and agree, on behalf of myself, mv heirs and successors, to the following conditions, viz. :— 1st.

In this communication it is stated that the last, desired to confine themselves to Sponge Fish eries only, and they urge that, in the circumstances the decision conveyed to them in the letter from this Department of the 13th ultimo, may te recon sidered. Lord Lansdowne observes that the Syndicate’s statement is not strictly correct. It is true that in their petitions of May 18th and 29th the The Under Secretary of State, India Office.the specific request in the concluding paragraphs of their petitions is for a Concession or Conces sions n for the purpose of exploiting the new beds of sponges discovered or to he discovered and deal ing in this article” (i.e. sponges). But their objects are further stated to he, inter alia:- (1) To carry on the business of exploration for sponges and other produce suitable to coinniercial purposes and (2) to carry on the business of Sponge, Pearl and Coral finders, merchants and dealers. Further Major Cox, in his despatch No.7 Com- J mercial of May 19th, reporting an interview with the Syndicate’s Agent in the Persian Gulf, states that that gentleman was sanguine as to the bright prospects of a Sponge industry but that 'there can be little doubt that the Sponge is only used by him as a screen for the pearl'. In these circumstances Lord Lansdowne proposes, if the Secretary of State for India in Council agrees, to reply to the Syndicate that His Majesty’s GovernmentGovernment must maintain the decision already con veyed to them, and he would he glad to learn whether Mr. Brodrick would consider it desirable to add that a Sponge isnery Concession must necessarily inter fere with the rights of Fishery already exercised by the natives in those regions. I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant39, DUKE STREET, copy. Sir:- ST. IJIARY AXE, LONDON, 28th June, 1905. I have to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's communication dated 15th instant in reply to the two petitions of the members of this Syndicate dated 19th and 29th ultimo, praying for a concession to be granted to them by His Majesty's Government for ex ploiting sponge in the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship's communication is to the effect that His Majesty's Government could grant no conces sion, as the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Per sian Gulf, with which they have relations, have a right to the exclusive use of the Pearl Fisheries within the three mile limit. In reply to Your Lordship's letter I humbly beg to state that the two petitions of the members of this syndicate afore-mentioned did not pray for a concession of Pearl fishing, as they are well aware His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.aware that such fishing has been and is carried on by the tribes, but they prayed that a concession be granted to them for Sponge fishery only, an article of which the tribes have no knowledge and have never fished for, and the existence of which this Syndicate have, after considerable expense and trouble, discovered in the Persian Gulf. If Your Lordship will permit me I may humbly suggest that a concession granted by His Majesty's Government to this Syndicate for Sponge fishery only, such concession will be far from doing any injury to the interests of the tribes, on the con trary by its exploitation a new industry would be locally created and the tribes would greatly benefit thereby. On the strength of the statements that precede I, on behalf of the members of this Company, hum bly beg that Your Lordship may be pleased to re consider the matter and grant the concession prey ed for, on such terms and conditions as to Your Lordshipcopy.

I am directed by His Lordship to state that, in so far as concerns the tribes with which they have relations, His Majesty's Government could grant no concessions in derogation from the exclusive fishery rights which those tribes have always enjoyed and to which His Majesty's Government consider them to be en- The Secretaries to The Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited, 39, Duke Street, St. Mary Axe. titledentitled.

However, the papers indicate that it was felt by British officials that the real object of the company was to exploit the Gulf's pearl banks, which entailed the risk of infringing Britain's treaty obligations with the Arab states.The principal correspondents are the Foreign Office; Major Percy Zachariah Cox, acting as Consul-General for Fars, Khuzistan etc., and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; officials of the India Office and the Government of India; the Viceroy of India (the Earl of Minto); and the Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited.The papers include: letters of application for concession rights from the company; the granting of a concession to the company by the Government of Persia; the granting of a concession to the company by the Sultan of Muscat; a report by the British Museum, on the Persian Gulf as a possible area for successful sponge fisheries (folios 175-176); the involvement of the company with the rulers of the Trucial Coast; and the rights of British-protected Arabs. The volume also contains an Admiralty chart of the Persian Gulf on folio 50.The French language content of the volume consists of an agreement on folios 129-131.The date range gives the covering dates of the main items of correspondence. This is mainly dated 1905-09, with one item dated 1916. The correspondence also includes enclosures dated 1892 (folios 214-215).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, year the subject file was opened, subject heading, and list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
