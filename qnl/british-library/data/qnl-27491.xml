Memorandum: - Reference your memorandum No. C/1471 dated 31st October, 1943, instances have occurred in the past of persons or firms buying up consignments or a large proportion of a consignment of provisions imported from abroad, such consignments are not always from England, sometimes they are from India. 2. The matter was discussed by the Political Agont, myself and the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, last spring as it was found that canteen Managers and contractors to the services were frequently the culprits in these practices. The Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, took steps which, I believe, have checked wholesale purchases by service suppliers from the stocks in the bazaar. 3. I think a rule restricting the quantities to be bought by individuals as suggested in your para 2 would be useful and practicable but it is equally necessary to control the purchases by agents on behalf of cummunities such as service units or companies. 4. perhaps you would care to discuss the matter with me and the Director of Customs. j{/fl' mJm . 1 }lo'p -1 a - SF of 1362', Offic e of the Adviser t&lt;5 the Govermient, Bahrain Dated, Dulqaada 10, 1362 November 8 , 1943 H.

Dear' Sirs, Wo have taken up the question of supplies of Beer to your port, but the position still is that no experts of any kind are allowed as all the output of breweries is concentrated on supplying beer to the Forces on the Continent etc. Suppliers inform us that tney see no likelihood of supplies being available for the next few months at least uncil breweries are again working on the Continent. we therefore suggest that if you can make strong representations your end through the Government of India, and the India Office in London will give us official backing, this will enable us to recommence shipments to you as soon as the ban is lifted. Wja had a conversation with Mr. Campbell when he was in London when he suggested that, say, 20/30 barrels of pasteurised beer complete with bungs and taps for shipment to you during October/February. we took up this matter with breweries who inform us that outside the present ban on the export of beer, the difficulty is the barrels as these are not returned on export shipments, and that ^therefore there was a great shortage of them. d We will, however, keep the matter before us and see what can be uone when the present ban is relaxed.
