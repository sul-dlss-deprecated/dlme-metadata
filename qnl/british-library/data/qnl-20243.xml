Confidential.) gi r Bushire, February 5, 1932. I HAVE tiie honour to state that, during my recent visit to His Majesty King Ibn Saud, I discussed with him the question of the Koweit blockade. 1 began bv informing His Majesty that my visit was entirely private and informal and that I had no mission of any kind, neither had I received any instructions from His Majesty's Government, and emphasised that His Majesty s Minister at Jedda was, of'course, the channel for official communications. At the same time, it might be desirable to discuss any questions connected with the Persian Gulf informally, and I asked Ibn Saud if he had any matters which he wished to raise affecting the Gulf. 2. Ibn Saud replied that sometimes quite small matters loomed large m places in which they arose, because the places themselves are so small, and that he had nothing of importance that he wished to discuss, f then said that there was one matter regarding which I would like to take the opportunity ot ascertaining His Majesty's views, and that was the embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. I pointed out that at present Koweit was being ruined bv the cessation of its commerce with the interior; that the customs receipts had fallen from about 8 lakhs to under 2 and that, though some of this loss might be due to the prevailing commercial depression, there was no doubt that much of it was owing to the blockade which His Majesty had imposed. 1 asked His Majesty whether, in view of his close former relations with Koweit, some means could not be found to alleviate the situation. Ibn baud said that Koweit interests were his, and that he and Sheikh Ahmad were brothers, but what he feared was the loss to his own country. He had to consider that first of all. He was in direst straits for money ; though he made small allowances to his sons, he took nothing for his privy purse. He had no private domains, and the Beit-al-Mal, which formerly went to the Ruler, was now paid into the general revenues. He added ; I swear by God as a Moslem that 1 have no mone\ for my children, for my family, and I know not if they will have money for food and clothing. Money is a question of life and death, and no country can do without it.' If he allowed his tribes to go to Koweit he would lose the revenue now derived from Hasa and Ojair. n •, 3. I mentioned that in the days of the former -Nejd Government the tribes traded with Koweit and the then Government presumably took its dues. \vh\ should thev not do so now? His Majesty replied that then they weie all Badu, there was no Government, the tribes did as they pleased. What would suit him best was for his people not to trade with Koweit under any circumstances. [ mentioned that thev were apparently permitted to trade with Iraq through Zubair, to which His Majesty replied that he proposed to stop this, too, and compel them to get all supplies in their own country through their own ports. 4. The conversation continued for some time on these lines, and ultimate!} His Majesty said that there were three ways in which the matter could be settled : — (1) He should be allowed to establish a post at some place on the outskirts of Koweit territory, e.g., Subaihiyah, where he would take his customs, Koweit to guarantee that all goods should pass through this place, and that nothing should leave its borders by any other route. (2) A Nejd customs post in the hands of Nejdi official, with, however, no official position in Koweit, should be established at the gate ol Koweit town and he would collect the Nejd dues as caravans passed out. (3) Koweit should make a fixed annual payment representing the Nejd share of the Koweit customs. [408 e—1]5. 1 suggested that, since caravans must follow certain well-defined routes in order to obtain water, a chain of border posts could easily control them, though, obviously, a few odd camels could slip through from time to time. His Majesty retorted that smuggling would certainly take place, and that even now they could not prevent luxuries which paid higher duty from being smuggled. I pointed out that it was virtually impossible on a long frontier line to stop a certain amount of smuggling in any country and that we had been unable effectively to stop gun-running, despite the expenditure of very large sums of money, but what w T as possible was to exercise control over cara\ans con\eying smuggled goods into the interior, provided the caravans passed through one s own territory. The Persian Government had, to a very large extent, reduced smuggling into Persia., not by patrols along the coast, but by making it exceedingly difficult to transport goods into the interior. 6. His Majesty then went on to say that if he allowed trade with Koweit Ojair would be killed and Hasa would lose one-fourth of its trade. So for the time being I left the matter at that. 7. Subsequently, I discussed the matter with Yussuf Yasin, and he informed me that His Majesty had realised that proposals (1) and (2) put forward by him were impracticable.' Koweit could not possibly guarantee that all goods would pass through the tunnel of Subaihiyah, or wherever it might be established, and he realised that the suggestion of establishing a customs post at the gate of Koweit town would never be accepted by the sheikh, and in any case would prove unworkable. For instance, many of the Koweit Araibdar and tribesmen fvom Iraq come in to purchase goods in Koweit. It would not be possible for the Nejd officials to distinguish between them. The only solution he could suggest was that there should be an annual payment by Koweit to Nejd. The sheikh, however, had informed Colonel Dickson previously that he would never agree to anything of this sort as it would be regarded as a tribute in Arabia. 8. Yussuf Yasin mentioned that some customs arrangement of this kind was in force between Palestine and Syria and in other places. I said 1 knew nothing about this, but he must bear in mind that an arrangement which would be perfectly feasible between two Powers of equal standing might bear a different appearance when entered into between a big man and a small man. I also pointed out that the blockade really amounted to an act of war, and that if the Government of India took similar action, say, in the case of Goa, in order to divert trade to their own port, Bombay, it would unquestionably evoke very serious protests on the part of the Portuguese Government. Colonel Dickson ■and I, however, did not entirely dismiss the possibility of some solution on the lines of a payment by Koweit'to Nejd and thought that circumstances might- force the sheikh to agree. 9. However, the following day I again returned to the charge with Ibn Saud and made a personal appeal to His Majesty, pointing out all he owed to Koweit and the fact that he had been brought up there. 1 said that, presumably, he did not want to see it ruined and sink to the level of Debai, as it certainlv w T ould do if the present policy were persisted in. The King said that he must consider his own interests and that it was for him to milk his own people and not to supply pasture cows for Koweit. Ultimately, however, he said that the only solution he could see was for arbitrators from either side, consisting of well-known merchants, with possibly one official, to meet and try and work out a compromise that would be agreeable to both parties, but the arbitrators must be carefully selected for their patience and ability. I welcomed the suggestion and promised to put it before Sheikh Ahmad. 10. The discussion on the whole was conducted in a most friendly spirit. Ibn Sand was not uncompromising and his description of his financial straits was, of course, correct, and at present, at any rate, he cannot aftord to lose a penny of his revenues. On the other hand, if any system can be devised by which he will not lose revenue or have to incur heavy expenditure on the establishment of posts on the frontier, then, I think, he will be prepared to meet us half way. I asked Yussuf Yasin if the real reason of the blockade was not that His Majesty was afraid that the tribes might establish too close relations with Koweit. He said : ' No, not nowadays. We have got them too much in hand.' 11. If I may sav so, I think perhaps it would have been helpful if His Majesty's Government had seen fit to inform the Nejd Government of the large and exceedingly well-substantiated claims put forward by Koweit against them.It would have given me. to some extent, a lever. All that we could do under the circumstances was for Colonel Dickson to mention the matter to \ ussuf Yasin. While normally I doubt if much can be accomplished by the appointment of commissioners, especially in such cases as frontier aft airs, boundaries. &amp;c., the present case is rather different. I have no doubt one of Ibn &gt;&gt;aud s commissioners will be a member of the Quasaibi clan. Koweit also has one or two merchants of considerable standing. The latter will be fighting ior their own existence and welfare, and will certainly spare no effort to arrive at some arrangement, and once the question is reduced to a commercial basis there is some prospect, at any rate, of a settlement being arrived at. For instance, it seems possible that they might agree to increase the Koweit customs duties, which are at present merely 4 per cent., and then for so many annas in the rupee to be paid to Nejd, or something of that sort. If an arrangement of this sort was arrived at between the commissioners, the mercantile community of Koweit would certainlv bring a good deal of pressure to bear on the sheikh to accept it. I would, therefore, suggest that if the sheikh agrees to the appoint ment of arbitrators Ibn Saud should then be asked, through His Majesty s Minister at Jedda. to inform us what type of representatiyes he proposes to nominate, e.g., whether merchants or officials, so that Koweit can appoint the same kind of persons. I would suggest two merchants and one official, preferably .a customs official. When these details have been settled, 1 would suggest that, if Sir Andrew Ryan sees no objection, he should be authorised to inform Fuad Hamza personally of the Koweit claims, and, if he considers it desirable, let him have a copy. He can say at the same time that His Majesty s Government had not presented these claims as they were hopeful that a friendly settlement of the Koweit blockade would be arrived at. If so, the sheikh would be willing to let the claims go, but that they thought it desirable to let the Nejd Government know informally that these claims had been submitted. I am asking ( olonel Dickson to ascertain Sheikh Ahmad's views regarding the appointment of -commissioners and will report further in due course. ^ I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda and to the Government of India.

It is unnecessary to recapitulate the conversations at which you ^usxyourseIf were present, but the final outcone was that His Majesty stated that while he could neither afford in hi a preaent condition to sacrifice any revenue no^t to incur any additional e*ptnditure, he was willing to agree to the appointment of commissi one rB to discuss the matter from the business point of view, and iie more or less accepted the position that if «oiae arrangement could be arrived at by viiich trade vi«L Kuwait wooxu not involve him in any pecuniary loss he would be prepared to consider favourably the discontinuance 01 the blockade.

Saud, in the matter of the blockade of Ke^d# I also dis cussed Ihe matter from eTory angle, especially bringing out the fact that Colonel Biscoe, who had his interests greatly at heart, was disposed to think that the plan proposed by Bin Saud, namely that 3 Commissioners be appointed by both sides to explore ways and means, and try and discover a way out of the impasse, was one that at any rate offered some prospect of solution and was certainly an advance on the previous hopele«sly difficult attitude of the King. 5, The Shaikh at first adopted a very 'sticky' attitude, and while thanking Colonel Biscoe sincerely fcr all his obvious efforts on behalf of Kurait, pointed out in rather forcible language that he ecu Id see no prospect at all of the Commissioners succeeding in their object, as there was really no ouestion in dispute, between Bin Saud and himself, such as a doubtful w boundary ,, question , or a piece of territory which both claimed, and which could be argued out by the representatives of both sides, in a give and take spirit. On the contrary tl® issue he said was a perfectly clear one. Firstly Bin Saud wanted money, and to obtain it he had decided to throttle Kuwait and divert its trade through To Captain E .H .Qastrell, Secretary to the Hon t ble the Political Resident f vV f in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.••2- through Ojair and Hassa, Seoondly he wanted the Port of Kuwait to round of his Hncdom, and Uie throttlinc process would not only assist him in getting liie money he wanted, but would help him realize his second and life ambition by, ) &gt; as he hoped, slowly forcing Kuwait to agree to become a Vassal State from motives of self ~ , 4 # The Shaikh remarked that he for one would die rather than become a vassal of Bin baud's, and as regards i Bin Saudis efforts to bring pressure by ruining Kuwait s trade, he thou^fcit that was a matter for His Majesty's Govern- meat who ought to come to his assistance a friend and ally by compelling Bin Saud to raise the blockade under threat of breaking off relations 5 # I found it somewhat difficult not to agree with everything the Shaikh said, but grimly stuck to the main issue, and I am glad to say was at length able to persuade the Shaikh to agree to the ^three Comniissioners 1 w idea. Please therefore tell Colonel Biscoe that the Shaikh will agree to the proposal, though he does not believe anything will come of it, and possibly he will be made a laughing stock^ ^ 6. The Shaikh however insisted on my making it quite clear to Colonel Biscoe that he would on no account agree to the following being even discussed:- (a). The placing in Kuwait a Nejd official to collect Nejd customs on goods leaving the main City Gate. (b). The foroin^ of individuals or caravans to proceed by a sort of w tunnel' route from Kuwait to a post of Bin Saud's located on the frontier. (c). The payment of an annual sum of maney in lieu of customs tax to Bin Baud. The first because it would affect his honour as an independent Ruler. The second because it was impossibleimpossible for him to cuarrantee success. The 'ttiird because such an act would be tantamount in the eyes of all arabs to his paying the ^ezzia** or Tassalage tax. always done, to the 'manifest system w being adopted Ihat is the compelling of all caravans, small or large, proceeding to Nejd from his town to be in possession of properly drawn up manifests, copies being sent to the K ing or any otiier official or officials he migjit desire# . He of course would welcome frontier Customs Posts which he had always pleaded for, as the only sensible and s obvious way out of the difficulty# 8 # The Shaikh at the end of the interview smilingly remarked that he as an Arab kn6w Bin Saud t s innermost mind better than Colonel Biscoe or me and was in no way deceived by his Bin Saud's proposal to Colonel Biscoe. Clearly he said Bin Saud wished to end an awkward and undesirable conversation, as he realized that Colonel Biscoe was oomerfeg him# He therefore put forward tiie 'Committee of merchants' idea just to end the talk, all Hie time making the necessary mental reservations. allcwing any committee to spoil his plans, the Shaikh cited tiie recent farming out of the Hassa 'Customs' to the Al- Qosaibi and Al-Ajaji, of Hassa and Bahrain fco: 11 lacs of rupees for the year 1932# As far as he knew here the matter was put liirougi by Mohomed Tawil just after Colonel Biscoe left Hoffuf. Bin Saud could not possibly go back on this 'farm', as he would have to do, if there was any proposal of raising or even modifying the Kuwait blockade. It would not be fair on the fanners. He would on the other hand agree as he had To pr6ve that Bin Saud had no intention ofCONPrDEKTIAL. L. O. No. C-20 of 1932.

I think it would be deeirable to get eoraething in writing froai the Shaikh. Frankly I think he is taking up a stupio attitude: it is all very well to ride the high horse, but when one's revenue is rapidly de- -clining, ana the other fellow has the whip nana the wiser course is to try and get the best terms one can, provided they do not involve anything definitely lower- -Ing to one's self-respect. Now as regards paragraph 3 I agree that Bin Baud *ants money and has therefore decided to divert trade to his own ports^ But this after all is a per- -fectly legitimate measure. As iegards his ae-iie to reduce Kuwait to vassalage I uo not agree. I think Bin faud once had ambitions in that direction but I think he now uefinitely realises that His Majesty's Government would never tolerate this, and I think he is much too worried about running his existing dominions to seek territorial expansion at trie present time* I am afraid that the idea of His Majesty's Government creaking off relatione with Bin Saud over the Kuwait blockade is not practical politlcsi Finally I can not see how the Shaikh can possibly be made a laughing stock by agreeing to tae Commissioners; As Lieut-Colonel H.P.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait•1-- . / i As regards paragraph 6 it woild seem quite unnecessary to make reservations (a) and (b), waicn Bin Saud himseli aamittea were out of the question.

They have now travelled a long distance and are already far off, and I, your brother, can see liiat it would be mostmost difficult for them, if I were to send after ^ tbem and delay Item on account of this mttar«, Also this mi^it lead to the spread of rumours which Your Majesty would probably not like. Here they near Kuwait, we would have taken the nece ssary action and carried Your Majesty* s wishes under any /t circumstances, but their question now concerns &amp; od and Your Majesty.

I ,w ^ You will remember that I sent you a telegram No.36 dated the IStfci March in reply to your d I o .C.20 dated 1iie I01ii March saying I would get out of the Shaikh as soon as he returned from Riath the formal fetter yoi require about the 3 Kuwait 'conmissioners' to meet Bin Saud^ 'Commissioners'*' and discuss possible ways and means for a removal of the Blockade# 2, During the Shaikh*s absence, (to be exact on 22nd March 1932) I took the opportunity of sending for and discussing the wholo question of 1iie blockade with ihe Shaikh's Confidential Secretary or 'Wazir' Khan Bahadur Mulla Salih, a shrewd man, who in his time served Shaikhs Mubarak, Jabir and Salim, In parti cular I asked him how in his opinion he iiiou^it the imtter mi^it be settled, and what terms he thoa^it the Shaikh would agree to being offered by his coraaissioners, always assuming tiiat Bin Saud i would also agree to thenu 3 # Mulla Salih's reply, and he took pains to add that it was his own opinion only , and was not to be taken in any way as reflecting the Shaikh's views, was to tiie effect that the Shaikh should propose 'ttie appointment of a special Kuwaiti Officer to collect Nejd customs on goods taken out ot the city by bona- fide Nejd merchants, Nejd tribesmen^and on goods exported to Nejd by Kuwait merchants. This man to have his office in the market place, side by side with the Shaikhs land Customs officials but to have a separate room of his own. Bin Saud to be asked by the Shaikh before operations started, what rate of customs he desired should be taken, every single article of goods likely to be The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H.Y.Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.be exported to Nejd being mentioned. The rate having been fixed, this special Customs Ofricer, to start operations. Receipts to be then collected and handed over to the Shaikh, who would privately remit same in the form of a lump sura to Bin Saud, either monthly, quarterly or annually as the latter wished. The arrangement to be an entirely private one as between Shaikh Ahmad and Bin Saud, all official reference to the system being carefully avoided. The idea being 1iiat the money would go as a sort of personal gift from one Huler to the other, and not be credited by Bin Saud to his general revenue. 4. Should Bin Saud desire to see the accounts at any time , copies could be sent privately by the Shaikh. 5. The point cf keeping the wholB thing a strictly private and personal arrangement, added Mulla Salih, was the Shaikh's fear lest the Arab world, think that ^uwait was paying tribute or 'Jezzia' Tax to Bin Saud. If once such an idea got abroad, then all would be spoilt, t, Pride w said Mulla Salih, was everything in the world to an Arab, and especially to an ancient ruling house such as the w As~Subah tf was. The Shaikh would rather die or see his city ruined than have his^onour' sullied in any way, as in the eyes of Arabs it would be if it was ever thou^it he was paying 'Jezzia^ Tax to / Bin Saud. 6. When I asked how Bin Saud could insure, thet he was getting the wktole customs receipts taken, Mulla Salih replied - w That is tiie whole point, the business must be run on ' mutual trus t lines# BoliL Rulers were hi^i spiritfed and honouralilfi Arabs, and if Ibr|3iibah gave his word to Ibn Saud 'that he would tfay straight, then the other must and would accept his fellow Ruler's pligftted word. Arab honour would not require more'. 7. Mulla Salih finally said that it of course wouia. be open to both or either party to conclude the arrangement any time they thought fit, for instance K uwait could not be expected to continue the arrangement, if Ibn Saud was involved in hostilities with Eis Majesty's Governmeiit, or if he started blockade restrict ions again etc. etc.8. Mulla Salil^s views open up fresh possibilities, and I write the above rather at length to show you how the ^rab mind works and how that the biggest difficulty we are up A against in this business is 'Arab Pride'. Ibn Saud has a sufficiency of this we know^ but Ibn Subah, I suppose because he is the little fellow, and so more sensitive / has a 'double amount'• This 'pride' business is a wonderful thing, as instance the murder recently in Bagdad of the Mutasarrif by Abdullah Beg al cfaleh as-Saadun, and I fear we have got to take it into our calculati ons.o3/o4.

Kuwait Blockade and p roposal to appoint Com mission ers from both si des . |v Sir, yt Witb, reference to my telegram No.06 dated the 16th March 1932, I have the honour to report that on the return of His iixcellency the Shaikh from ^iath on 3rd April I took 'the first opportunity to call on him and explain the gist of your confidential D.0.Ko.C.20 dated the 10th March to me. I then proceeded to write an official letter to him, translation of which together with his reply which I fear is not as satisfactory as it might be, I forward as enclosures to this letter, lly letter as you will see merely recapitulated previous events and included a formal request that the Shaikh should give me in writing what he had pre viously agreed to verbally. 2. You will observe that in his letter His Sxcellen cy agrees to the proposal that 3 commissioners from ei13ier side should be appointed, but he makes it clear that lie has very little faith in any such discussions bearing fruit. 3. His Excellency, also in spite of the fact that, I was particularly careful KSsack to tell him in the course of conversation, both on my return from Massa and again on-3- ^ on receipt or yoiir iM»»o»No»C»20 datied 'th.e 10'fch llarch., 'that i^in Saud had himself admitted to you the impracticability of having (a) a Customs official of his own in Kuwait City, and (b) a single Customs Post on the frontier with a Kuwait guarrantee that all exported goods should pass through it; b- '' nevertheless in his present letter reiterates that he can never agree to either of such proposals, nor can he agree to a third one viz, a fixed sum of money being made over by him to Bin Saud, in order to n bu^off the Blockade' to use his expression. 4. In answer to a question put by me to the Shaikh at an interview subsequent to the receipt of his letter, as to why be had introduced all three conditions into his letter, knowing that two of them no longer held good, the Shaikb replied, that he had done so to make his view point quite clear, to His Majesty's Government knowing that his letter would probably be sent on to London. He also said that he did not believe that Bin Saud was sincere when he talked about dropping two of the conditions. he said Bin Jaud/had always in the past offered to raise the blockade if he, the Shaikh, would agree to any single one of tlie three conditions# If therefore Bin Saud was prepared to withdraw two of them, it meant that he would still adhere to the third as a condition of raising the blockade, namely that a lump sum be annually handed over to him. 5. His Sxcellancy hinted indeed that the last condition, namely the payment of a lump sum was the most difficult of fulfilment of all, as the Arab world would look upon it a 'tribute' or'Jezzia M Tax and would definitely place him in the position of a 'vascal'. The arrangement would no doubt be most acceptable to Bin Saud, as fhe latter v^oald be getting money, for nothing, and would quite understand the real meaning and significance, of such an act, 6. The Shaikh's attitude I regret to say has all along been, and still is that it is up to His Llajesty'silajesty's G-ovenuoeEt as his protecting power not to leave him to fight his own battles, but to ocme to his assistance, and impleioent their promises made during the ilkhwan rebellion. Hence the last paragraph of his letter. His argument is tlB t His Hajesty's Government knows^ quite well that Kuwait is weak, and consequently should be able to understand tbat any negotiations entered into by himself direct with his big neighbour must either prove abortive, or end in his surrender ing a vital part of his independence. On the other hand he maintains that if His Majesty*s Government really were willing to bring even a small amount of diplomatic pressure to bear on Bin Saud ; whr^e he is forced to believe they are apparently loath to do, the latter would at once react, for althcu^i outwardly a King, Bin Saud i\ in reality still a rou^i Bedouin at heart, and would at once appreciate the necessity for yielding to His Liajesty's Govermoent t s wishes. 7. This attitude of the Shaikh is clearly reflected in his letter to me under reference, and which if examined carefully, follows the line of argument propounded by him at his interview with me on 17th February 1938 and which was reported in my confidential D.C. No. 17 dated the 17th February last, 8o To sum up it would appear that His Excellency the Shaikh from his letter is definitely against •the'three comriissioners tT idea, even though he egrees to give the pro posal a trial, out of regard for yourself anr 1 His Majesty^ Government. Whether you will think this Justifies proceed not know ing further with Ihe matter, I do/but in any case I shall await your further instructions.

Reference Hie recent conversation which I had with Your Excellency on Monday 4tii April. 2. Your Excellency will recollect that on lEth February last liie Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf wrote and told me to explain to Your Excellency that during his visit to H. M. King Bin Sa^d in Hasa the latter agreed after considerable pressure to the appointment of three Kuwait commissioners who would discuss the/blockade matters with, a similar number of Kuwait representatives, end more or less accepted the position that if some arrangement could be arrived at by which trade with Kuwait would not involve him in any pecuniary loss, he would be prepared to consider favourably the discontinuance of the blockade. 3. In his letter liie Hon t ble 'Qie Political Resident was disposed to think that the plan proposed by Bin Sa'ud was one that at any rate offered some prospect of success, and was worthy of Your Excellency^ very serious ccnsideration. He also gave it as his opinion that it was desirable to exclude -s as far as possible state officials, in order that the discussion should be kept as far as possible on a business footing. For this reason he said he personally would like to see the commiss ioners consist of two leading merchants, and one official only, preferably a customs official.4o Colonel Bisooe lastly asl©d me to ascertain Your Excellency^ views on tlie matter, and trusted that Your Excelloicy would agree to the proposal. So You will recollect that I informed Your Excel lency of the contents of Colonel Biscoe's above letter and discussed the whole matter with Your Excellency on 17th February Oast, and Your Excellency was good enough to convey your approval to the proposal, namely that three n Commissioner2 from either side should assemble at a place to be agreed upon and attempt to solve the Blockade Problem in a way that would be satisfactory to the honour and dignity of both sides. 6. Your Excellency at the time made certain remarks and reservations, which were all faithfully reported by ms to Colonel Biscoe, and you expressed 'the opinion among other things that althouhg you did not entirely believe that the commissioners would be able to arrive at a satisfactory solu tion, neverthless out of regard for 131 e wishes of the Hon^le the Political Resident, and in order that Bin Sa'ud should not be given a handle to say later that it was not he but the Shaikh of Kuwait who had created difficulties, you said you were willing to agree. 7. The above conversation was duly reported to the Hobble the Political Resident on 17th February last. 8. The latter has now written to me in a letter dated 10th March (which letter reached rae the day after Your Excellency proceeded to Riyadh), and has asl©d me to obtain from Your Excellency a formal letter intimating Your Excel lency^ acceptance of the aforesaid proposal. On receipt of this letter from Your Excellency, Colonel Biscoe states he will immediately talag up the matter with Bin Sa'ud through His Majesty's Govemaant, who in the meantime have doubtless asked . _ tforfor a similar letter from the King. 9^ Colonel Bisooe lastly instructed me to ask Your Excellency whether you were in favour of the two merch ants and one customs official forming the commission, or whetht -er you would prefer a different arrangement. 10.. I would request Your Excellency to be so good as to favour me with an early reply, in order that I can forward Your Excellency's letter to Bushire by next down mail.

Dated the 4th Dhil Hujjah 1350 (10-4-32). After canpliments, With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No* 51 dated liie 2nd inst and understood what has been proposed by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with regard to the discussions which he had with His Majesty King Bin Sa'ud during the former's visit to His Majesty at Hasa, regarding the question of the Kuwait blockade, and how that the latter agreed after considerable pressure to the appointment of three commissioners from either sidd in order to discuss the matter, and that the Hobble the Political Resident is of the opinion that it is desirable to exclude state officials in order that the discussions should be kept on a business footing, and would like to see the commissioners consist of two leading merchants and a third person who should be a customs official; all this I have noted, even to the end of your statement. I^om my whole heart, I thank the Hon^le the Political Resident for his efforts and kind thought fulness, and I have already informed you verbally that I approved of his proposal, even thou^i I have extremely little hope of its being able to solve the blockade problem, and feel sure that no result will be arrived at through the discussions of the commissioners, except failure, and the providing of newspaper editors with an opportunity to gossip. His Majesty King Bin Sa*^ would assuredly have agreed - 2 -agreed to establish customs posts at the principal strategic points along Ms frontier, (line of wells), had he really- desired to settle the question of the blockade, in which case we, as always, would have been prepared to help him to control and check the goods exported by his subjects, by forwarding manifests for everything, whether big or small. But you were informed by His Majesty (Bin Sa'ud) that he would never agree to the establishment of such customs posts, because this would involve him in great expenditures• Neverthless, we, in compliance with the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf's wishes, do accept and agree to the appointment of the said commission of two leading merchants, the third being either a customs official, or somebody else, even though no benefit will result from their discussions. As regards the ever steady demands of His Majesty King Bin Sa'ud, namely (l) the appointment of a customs official by him in Kuwait, (2) the payment of a fixed sum of money, and (3) the establishment of a single customs post on the frontier, with a guarantee from us that all exports should pass through it (tunnel system); it is absolutely impossible for us to agree to such demands, and it is for this reason that I do not see any possibility of the commissioners being able to solve the Blockade Problem* You will no doubt recollect that during the activities of the Nejd rebels (Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30), I pointed out to the Hobble the Political Resident the immense losses which Kuwait has suffered (as a result of the blockade), and that he promised that His Majesty's Government would endeavour as far as lay in their power, to remove 1iie difficult- ies iget the blockade raised), and open a way which would lead to the well-being and prosperity of Kuwait.

As regards the view expressed by the Shaikh, that the appointment of coomissi oners is unlikely to produce a solution of the difficulty, I cannot but think tnat despite this the proposal should be proceeded with # .-ven if the commissioners arrive at no satisfactory settlement, Ibn Saud will be made ayirare of the fact that His Majesty^ Government are interesting themselves in the question of the Kuwait blockade, and, if I may say so, I think it is incumbent upon them, in view of the promise .aade to the Shaikh at the time of the Akhwan rebellion, to take some steps in the matter.

Ibn Saud himself admitted that the first two were impracticable and I told Yusuf iasin that the Shaikh would nerer a^ree to the third, and Ibn 3aud himself knows perfectly well that it would bear in Arab eyes the appearance of a tribute.

D.O.Ko.242-.&gt; of 1932. 5^ 0 British Residency, Buahire, the 23rd Aprii 1932. I am sending you by this aail a despatoh regarding the Kuwait blockade, in wh ch I have urged that the satter should be taken up at Jedcia* In this deai*official letter I propose to put before you certain general aspects of the matter, of which I th nk you should be raade aware. I am inclined to think that the Shaikh of Kuwait nowadays is to some sli^at extent losing faith in us* Up to the present he has been sonspicuously loyal in his attitude and has ^.one out of his way in many minor matters to make his friendship with the British plain ts his subjeets. He realises that he is surrounded by two powerful nei^bours and has pinned his faith to the British to support him and to stand up for his interests. Ihile I think he still considers that his best hopes of salration lie in us X am not at all sure th t he does not now think it desirable to effect a re-insu ance policy by cultiTatinf closer relations with Ibn Saud and abandoning all causes of friction* The fallowing considerations must be borne in mind. 0. firstly, the 3hi£kh undoubtedly hears a ,good deal of anti- British propaganda current in the uazars of Kuwait and * Iraa. The riews expressed may be summed up as bein; to the effect that the British are 'on the run 1 * and that democracy cannot rule an irapire, etc. He has before him the fate of his close friend, the Shaikh of Mohastiierah. He is sore about the Ojair agreement where he considers that we saerificed Kuwait interests .c.j; .Parkinson,Esq* 9 O.B.B., lolunial Office, indon. ,'W finterests for our own ends* He said to Cox at the tiae '♦then it is still the strong man armed who wins the day despite the talk about the ri{£its of sraall people 1 * and Cox had to admit that it was so v In his eyes we seem to lie trying to erade the fulfillment of the undertaking definitely ^iTen to him in the War that the Kuwait date gardens would always be exempt from taxation. As far as he is aware we hare done nothing to try and implement the promise made to him orer two years a^o to take up the question of the Kuwait blockade. He sees that our attitude towards the Persies is Tery different from what it was formerly. He has recently paid a visit to Hiadh where he has receiTed the warmest welcome from Ibn Saud, and returned loaded with gifts* Having regard to all these circumstances 9 it cannot be wondered at, I think, if at times certain doubts regarding our intent ions cross his mind, and if, with all these numerous examples of* hope deferrad* before him, he does not sometimes wonder whether he would not lie well adrised not to offend his powerful I neighbour* How it may of course be argued that we hold Kuwait in the hollow of our hand and can impose our will there any time we choose, and that it is a matter of indifference to us what the personal feelings and inclinations of the liul^r may be. This, I think, is an extreaely narrow view* Firstly, to honour ne*s pledges redounds to one's credit* Steps to this end taken openly and publicly and especially in the case of a small State where we cannot be accused of harin^; been acMituated primarily by self interest enhance our prestige* They are the subject of open and farourable comment in the Arab world and after all that people should think that our promises are not lightly given and when given are fulfilled is a very valuable asset in this world. Secondly ...Secondly, during the War we did auoh to obtain the friendeiiip of eren Tery small men, and as we nowadays aore than erer seem to hare rererted to trie policy of trying to hold the British SMpire with the prorerbial corporal's ^uard we may yet in some future crisis find the friendship of small men of Talue again. For these reasens ^ do consider it desirable that we should now make some definite effort to implement the promise made to the Jhaikh about the blockade more than two years ago. I am not Tery hopeful about the commissioners myself»but it will show Ibn Saud that we intend to do so^iethin^, and if they fail to arrire at as arrangement, I think, we shall be then in a rery strong position to say frankly to Ibn Saud that we riew this blockade as an unfriendly actJ that erery effort has been icade without success to effect a settlement by the means suggested by him and that there seems nothing now '(a for it owdfiVi 1r ~ adopt the manifest system su&amp;^ested by the Shaikh of Kuwait, These things take sometime to arrange, but if the commissioners could meet ^uring the stamer or Ter/ c^rly in the autumn, and if they , it is probable that I could arrange to meet Ibn Saud at Hasa again next winter 9 and if His Majesty*© Oorernment agrees X should be quite prepared to hare a tussle with him on this subject. 4.D.O.

I am sorry about the telegram you refer to,and I shall try and see that It does not occur again. About the Sheikhs visit to Rlath, and your remarks thereon. I am afraid the Sheikh from the first never Intended to discuss Blockade matters xvlth Bin Saud, and If you remember when I went to Hoffuf with you I was asked by him to deliver a message to that effect. The Sheikh I admit is being very difficult in this matter ) and It is not easy to make excuses for him. As far as I can make out the Sheikh is in process of trimming his sails, and is definitely anxious today to let matters lie where the Blockade is conce^ned^ if he is to be called upon to move in the matter. His people are of course anxious for relief but their Rul&lt;='r appears to have developed a peculiar ke9nnes c not to offend Bin Saud just now. He passed a curious remark to me recently when I was talking to him preparatory to getting the letter out of him that you wa-nted. It was as follows; 'If H.M.G's only object is to try and get me to try and effect a settlement direct with Bin Saud then I say let things be, as they are, I am content to wait till Bin Saud dies - Then I shall get all I want'. He said this irTT tone of appeal as if he feared something.

He instanced the fact that the Sheikh had since hia return called on the merchants for a 1^10000/- subscript ion to feed the poor, and that the amount collected had reached feSOOO/- in two days: Nafisi ended his talk by saying that he had received a personal letter from Bin Saud by the hand of his son who had accompanied the Sheikhs party, to the effect that he Bin Saud sent his special 'salaams' to me, and was much pleased with all my efforts to bring about a better understanding between Kuwait and Nejd. I have a sort of feeling that the Sheikhs curious desire to keep in with Bin Saud these days is possibly due to the Anti British propaganda which has for sometime past been going on^in Kuwait: I have nentioned the matter to vou before. It takes the form that ^-reat Britain is * y* N .-v. &lt;V^ , • ^ ... . . loosing her grip of things in the Near East and East general -ly, as instance the condition of Indi ., her relaxing her hold in Iraq, and ;:er policy in P-^sia etc, etc. Great Britii^ is pictured bela 0 all too read^ nowadays to -doot the line of least resistance, abandon her rights, desert her friends, and generally rely on the League of Nations (a broken reed) to ajust her affairs for her. Nearer home, the Sheikh has seen unaccountable delaysjas he thinks, in the matter of his Date G-ardens, the settle ment of the Blockade, and the Post and Telegraph question. All this in a way conf irtis ^ he thinks^ what propagandists are ever preaching. He of course fears Nejd and Iraq, the latter much more than the former, '. T hat better course, he thinks t than to be in the fashion and arrange a rapprochment with one of his strong neighbours Bin Saud, a big personage crrtalnly^ nd to whom he after IT i? relateti by tribal ties ,Though I have of course nothing definite to 10 on as yet, I have a c ort of feeling that the Sheikhs visit tA Til ,th was ' r lth a view to arran ;e some sort of secret alliance, or at any r&amp;te to prepare the way for one. The above Is of course surmise, but I believe there is something in it, - - - (Paragraphs 8 to 10 extracted and placed on j?iie 86/1 regarding Kuwait uii; 11.

It will be seen that His Majesty King Ibn Saud has apparently permitted Nejdi caravans to visit 1 Iraq for the purchase of supplies. ihen I discussed the Question with King Ibn Saud I pointed out that he was allowing Kejdi caravans to go into 'Iraq and was presumably obtaining customs dues from them on their return and that therefore his prohibition of all f trade with Kuwait seemed to be wholly unjustified. If they could trade with 'Iraq why could they not trade with Kuwait, and if he could recover customs dues from caravans which had entered 'Iraq why could he not do so from caravans that entered Kuwait ? His Majesty replied that he did not wish his people to trade with * Iraq but wished all trade to come through his own ports and that h* proposed to stop it. It will be seen, however, that he is authorising trade with 'Iraq while maintaining the blockade against Kuwait, and that he proposes to levy customs dues on caravans returning from ^Iraq when they reach their destination in i^lejd. This completely knocks the bottom out of his contention that if he permitted trade with Kuwait it would be necessary to have a cordon along the ... esty* s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, LOHDO-.along the frontier to oftlleot customs dues. To any one acquainted with local conditions It is evident that this is largely a pretext for refusing to allow trade with Kuwait, since large caravans must follow well-defined routes In order to obtain water and there is actually no difficulty in levying customs dues when they reach their destination in Hejd* 3* 1 would mention further that the Hejdi tribesmen and merchants, for a variety of rea3ons 9 much prefer purchasing their requirements in Kuwait to purchasing them in v Iraq« Firstly f they have long-standing commercial connections with Kuwait, and the Kuwait merchants give them extensive credit* Secondly, the Hejd Mutair and AJman have many relations among the Shaikhs Araibdar, who are also J'utair and AJman, and If they proceed to Kuwait can not only purchase goods but also arrange marriages and see their relations, etc* Thirdly, if a dispute arises between a Badu and a shopkeeper In Kuwait, the Badu can obtain Immediate redress, as the Shaikh or one of his hear relatives sits daily In the bazar to settle dispates and administer Justice in a rough and ready but paternal manner. This is not possible in ^raq. Finally, a Kuwait merchant will sell to a Badu everything he requires - his dates, his rice, his clothing, his tent ropes, camel gear, etc., etc*, but at Zubalr he has to get foodstuffs from one shop, clothing from another, ropes from a third, and so on - obviously a more troublesome arrangement* Many of us prefer to do our shopping in London at a large store such as Harrods than to wander about from one shop to another* 4* I have thought it desirable to bring these facts to notice since^ when the question of the Kuwait blockade is dis cussed with the Bejd*HeJaz Government's 1 hope it will be shortly, they will form, I think, a useful answer to the grounds that King Ibn Saud always gives for his action, and HisHis Majesty^ GoTernment can I think legitimately complain at the differentiation made between trade with Kuwait and trade with 1 Iraq.

It is reported that caravans from the province of Ciasim and Central Wajd, totalling eome 1200 camels, visited Zubair (3q. f.ix) on 29th April to purchase supplies. Tribesmen from the Harb and ^hamiaar accompanying this caravan state that Ibn i usa'ad, the uovemor of hail, visited Buraida (Sq, g.viii) about i5th April and gave iwr- mission for caravans to t*ade with Hie I*aq markets from Zubair northwards. Ibn iausa^d is also reported to have announced that the following dues would be imposed on all caravans returning from Iraq, payAent being made on the arrival of the caravan at its destination in hajd Foodstuffs .. .. Riyals 2 per camel load. Poffee •• .. Hiyals 6 per camel load. Clothing &amp; Materials •• Hiyals 6 per camel load. Caravans returning from Jubail (bq. g*x) ana Hasa (bq* h.x) would be exempted from these dues, but must oe in possession of documents ahowing wliere the goods were purchased. Similar reporte of a revival of trade activity have also been received from Samawa, which is now being visited by nuiaerous Najdi caravans, eager to avail themselves of the opportunity to purchase supplies at a comparatively reasonable price before the advent of the hot weather. (Authority; S.B.O^s As aalm&amp;n and Basra). Comment. Despite a favourable grazing season as instanced by the large quantities of M ghee rt now being brought into Subair by Majdi tribesmen, prices of essential com modities are still very high in the Najd tows. The present raising of the M blockade M in respect of trade between ttajd and the Iraq markets may therefore be regarded more in the light of an economic necessity than as an indication of the resunption of normal business relationships between the countries concerned.

Tel.25.4.35 j ''4* , . , —— 2, Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary oi State for India and the Secretary of State ior oreign Affairs, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would suggest that the question should now be taken up with the Hejaz-Nejd Government through His Majesty's Legation at Jedda in the following manner. King Ibn Saud should be informed that His Majesty's Government have received a report from the olioii.al Resident in the Persian Gulf upon his recent visit to Vie King at which the question of the Kuwait blockade was one of the questions discussed. King Ibn Saud will recollect that at first he expressed the opinion that there were three ways in which the matter could be settled, viz.- (l) He should be allowed to establish a post at some place on the outskirts of Kuwait territory where he would take/ THS UKDiSR SSCRtSTARY OP STATE, INDIA 0FPICJ5.take his customs, Kuwait to guarantee that all goods should pass through this place. (2) A ^ejd customs post in the hands of a Nejdi official should be established at the gate of Kuwait town to collect the Kejd dues as caravans passed out. (3) Kuwait should maise a fixed annual payment representing the Hejd share of the Kuwait customs. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin subsequently stated that the King realised that the first two suggestions were impracticable, and the Sheikh of Kuwait, who has been consulted, has stated that he cannot see his way to accept the third. King Ibn Baud, however, himself intimated to Colonel Biscoe as the result of their discussion that the only solution he could see was for ^arbitrators' from either side, consisting of well-known merchants and possibly one official, to meet and try to work out a comproraise which would be acceptable to both parties. The Sheikh of Kuwait accepts this proposal and His Majesty^s Government trust that ir the interests of co-operation and friendly relations between the ic-jaz-I^jd and Kuwait, King Ibn Saud will now agree to the appointment of such a Commission. If so, they will be glad to know whom the King would propose to appoint as his representatives The Sheikh of Kuwait for his part would be agreeable to appoint as the Kuwaiti representatives two merchants and one official (preferably a customs official). 3. If such a Commission is appointed. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would propose to inform Colonel Biscoe that His Majesty's Government see no objection to the Kuwaiti representatives putting forward a proposal on the lines suggested in p^ra^raph 11 of the Political Resident 's despatch/despatch 1jo.3 of the 5th of -Februrii-y. Colonel -Btacoe does not enter into any details of the rcheme which he proposes, but, reading the Resident*? proposal in the light of the observations m&amp;de in his telegram of the 13th of March and the connectf-d rorrespondence, fUr Philip Cunliffe-Lister enTi^agec a echem# scxnewhat cn the following lines • The Kuwait customs would te increased by an agreed p e rcent age auid an a^rt:ed proportion of these receipts would he paid over to the King. The ^ing would at the ssjne time establish frontier poots at the wells where he would arrange to collect his own customs dues on the entry of goods into i^iejd, and the Shaikh of Kuwait would institute a system of manifests which 'would enable a check to be kept upon the goods passing through the xjosts. The King would thus hare two separate sources of revenue, firstly a percentage of the Kuwait customs and secondly the money derived from his own customs. The scheme would aim ear to have severa! 1 advantages# Jj'irst, the King has said that he cannot afford to establish and maintain customs posts on the frontier as he has no money. If he were to receive a percentage of the Ku ^t customs in addition to his own customs dues, the money thus provided would oe available for this purpose, and the financial objection would be met. Secondly, there would be a definite inducement to the King to encourage trade through Kuwait, as his receipts both from the Kuwait customs and from his own customs would increase in proportion to the increase of trade. Thirdly, a system of this sort ahotlld benefit Kuwait inasmuch as the KUwait customs receipts would increase as a result of the greater volume of trade. It may be objected tint the payment of a percentage of the Kuwait customs would, in effect, be a payment for the purpose of buying off the blockade. x*ievertheless, it would not be/ be a fixed annuia payment, whicli would have the appearance of 'tribute*, and to whic.i the Sheikh would be strongly opposed, but rould vary from yeai v to year aooording to the volume cf trade, and it should be possible, therefore, for the oJieiJch to accept the arrangement without loss of prestige. 4. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would also suggest that .His Majesty 1 « iUaiator at Jedda should oe instructed to advise the Kejaj;-x ?6jd Govermaont at a suitable opportunity info niially oi the exidtenoe of the claims put forward oy the Sheikh of Kuwait A^aiuot king j .t&gt;n 5aud» Suon a co r Timunication mi ^ht be Eiade on the lines proposed by Colonel Biscoe in the latter part of paragraph 11 of his aespaten of the 5th of February.

In these cirouin stances Sir Samuel Hoare is inclined to think:, subject to Colonel Biscoe^ views, that it mi ^h be preferable to refrain from givin t , the representatives any lead as to the proposals which they should put forward or as to any arrangement which they should accept. 4. a copy of this letter is oeing sent to the Foreign Office.

Sir Phillip Cunliffe -Lister would appear to have got hold of the w wrong end of the stick entirely', if I may use the expression. 4. All along we have seen that the straight and honest way out of the difficulty, was for Bin Saud to establish his own Customs posts outside Kuwait territory and take his own Customs dues, and to this end the Shaikh of Kuwait repeatedly expressed his readiness to assist with the manifest system. For the Colonial Office to think that Kuwait will ever agree to Bin Saud having two sources of revenue at her expense^and of the kind envisaged, seems to show that the position has not yet been properly appreciated at Home. 5. No doubt you have noticed the point yourself and will by now have drawn His Majesty^ Government's attention to the matter.

Mien King Ibn Saud suggested the appointment of commissioners it was necessary to consider whether there was any probability that they would be able to arrive at a solution of the matter, and in thinking the matter over it occurred to me that some such arrangement as was outlined in my despatch J!io«3 of 5th February 1932 might be feasible, and that the discussions were not necessarily foredoomed to failure 9 even though the prospects of arriving at a settle ment were perhaps not very great* It must be remembered that the Oriental mind frequently works on lines which differ considerably from those of the ordinary European; and I have known cases where settlements have been arrived at which appear to the ordinary Englishman exceedingly illogical and somewhat •••• MaJetity* s Secretary of State for the Colonies 9 Colonial Office, London*Mmmm —fe -2- somewhat unsatisfactory, but apparently satisfy the people concerned. The greatest hope of a settlement lies in the fact that the Kuwait merchants hare a very direct interest in obtaining a relaxation of the blockade if they can. If the commissioners meet therefore I certainly think that we should leave the Kuwait merchants to fight their own battle, but at the same time should try and strengthen their hands as much as possible. This could be done firstly by bringing to the notice of the Hejaz-Hejd Government the existence of the Kuwait claims and the readiness of the Shaikh of Kuwait to waive them if the blockade was lifted, and secondly I would suggest that His Majesty v s Minister at Jedda might indicate that the action of the Hejaz-Sejd Government is exceedingly unfriendly and would not be tolerated in the case of any civilized countries, among which presumably the Hejaz-Mejd Government is trying at the present time to take its place, and that the differentia tion imposed between trade with 1 Iraq and trade with Kuwait, reported in my despatch No.19 of 18th May, has further emphasised the disagreeable impression created by the blockade. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's x Minister, Jedda, and to the Government of India. I have the honour to be.

'ihe Political Resident reports that fving ion Saud is permitting Nejdi caravans to trade with Iraq and that he is collecting Nejdi customs dues from these caravans when they reach their destination on their return to Nejd. This fact, in the Political Resident's opinion, renders nugatory King ibn baud's argument that, if Nejdi caravans traced with Kuwait, it would be necessary to establish a cordon of customs posts on the Nejd-Kuwait frontier, and maices clear that the king's prohibition of all trade with Kuwait is unjustified. 3. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is in agreement with the views expressed by the Political Kesident, and while he would not suggest that any mention should be made of the information now furnished when the Hejaz Nejd Goverrrnent are first approached on the matter as recommended in the letter from this Department of the 13th I-ay, he nevertheless considers that this information may well prove useful at some subsequent stage in the negotiations with the Hejaz Nejd Government or during the meetings of the arbitrators if they are appointed. 4.

Political Resident, Bushire. No «4-SAYINGr. Dated 25tli August received 12tti SeptemlDer, 1932» / v My telegram No.169 of 25th August. I sent copies of my note and per- -sonal letter of August 19th 'by 'bag which left on August 22nd. Personal letter was confirmation of informal communication which I made orally to Fuad on August 11th and enclosed a list of claims. Following is gist of Fuad^s reply of August 22nd, to my personal letter:- * I will deal with subject of your personal letter 'before replying to your note. There are many reasons for this. Two most important reasons are these. Firstly, intimation regarding claims is like a threat to enforce settlement completely independent of question of commercial relations. Secondly, their presentation shows clearly dis regard 'by Kuwait of international agreements, and it is no use concluding Ifurther) agreements if such agreements are not respected. Trade negotiations are more advantageous to Kuwait than to Nejd 'but King does not, out of consideration for Kuwait and desire to please E.M's Government,object to an agreement confer ring equal mutual advantages, agrees in princip»A to commission of delegates 'but prefers in view of...in view of your personal communication concem- -ing claims, to postpone it pending settlement of latter question. -Reasons are that on one tiand most claims are prolDa^ly not genuine, and on other hand there are large -Nejdi claims against Kuwait to he considered simultaneously. It is a serious consideration moreover that claims were settled reciprocally some months ago and disavow- -al of this settlement necessitates caution until Kuwait's willingness to respect agreements is established. Biscoe and Dickson discussed mutual claims at ilasa on January 27th. It was agreed to hury them and that King should write to Shaikh. Letter was written on 28th January and given to Biscoe and Dickson for delivery. Shaikh replied on Feh- -ruary 15th agreeing to hury all claims save one which had heen specifically excepted. I enclose copies of these letters to assure you of facts of settlement and in order that you may ascertain whether Shaikh seriously intends to return to this confusion of claims. As regards loans at time of operations against Hail, King admits them hut is uncertain of details which are lecorded in records in possess- -ion of Nafisi. He recollects wanting to 'buy rice hut Shaikh insisted on making it a gift and the same happened as regards loan. King will however pay immediately if Shaikh makes claim. I request you after reading enclosed letters, to inform me of decision of your G-overnment and Shaikh* •s in order that I may deal appropriately with hoth matters. • Following is...Following is gist of my rejoinder dated August 25tli:- ^ I am shocked at suggestion that personal letter, confirming for your convenience my oral communication, should 'be construed as a threat. It is quite usual, and implies no threat, to foreshadow concession on some other question when States are discussing import- -ant 'business. Only subject under discussion is that of restrict- -ions on trade. I was instructed, when pursuing of- -ficially, suggestion made hy King himself at Hasa,to make friendly intimation regarding claims. My G-overn- -ment will 'be gravely disappointed to learn that King proposes to allow this to delay main question. I ask him to reconsider frLs attitude. If claims 'beeom^ subject to official discussion King can contest them. Having no instructions to present them 'but merely to inform you of their exis- J -tence and foreshadow concession,^cannot discuss claims or effect thereon of correspondence which you enclose. I have some knowledge of this correspondence though only that hitherto in my possession is King's letter of December 30th. So far as I know Biscoe and Dickson and Shaikh considered it to relate only to small tribal questions. Claims of the very kind in first two parts of list are subject of important ques- -tion long familiar to both G -overnments though His Majesty's G-overnment have for some time past refrained from pursuing it for reasons explained to you. There is evidently misunderstanding but if matters so impor- -tant had...had 'been settled at Hasa Biscoe would have reported it and Yusaf Yasin would have mentioned it in letter to Biscoe of 28th January. 6///e / Question of trade, as you say, is entirely in- -dependent. I am sending this correspondence to my G-ovemment 'but strongly urge you to send early reply to my official note of August 19th.' BY AN.

Sir Hugh Biscoe did not touch on this point in his despatch Bo. 2 of &amp;th February 1932 as obviously it was intended to wover only minor claims. 3* His Majesty wrote his suggested letter and it was L , &gt;VV A# given to Colonel pickson for delivery to His Bxcellency the Shailch of Kuwait t idiom it eventually reached, who in due k TV'7 course replied, (copies of these were forwarded to you under my printed letter Mo« 42 of the 13th September 1932 (No* 659-S to the Crovermnent of India arid Jedda)), and to idiom His Majesty sent an acknowledgment (copy enclosed here- with) • His Majesty^ Sec%tary of State for the Colonies, London.4* Some apprehension was felt by Sir Hugh Bieooe lest His Majesty should read the widest possible meaning Into the abore correspondence and on the 14th March 1952 he addressed a communication on the subject to the Political Agent, Kuwait: 'Does notithls (I.e. the correspondence referred to) wipe out the whole of Kuwalt'ojolalms against Hejd In respect of Akhwan raids, etc.? If It does not, I think: It would be as well to clear up the matter* 11 The Shallch, who had not yet recorered from the hypnotising Influence of a Tlsit to His Majesty at Riyadh, where he had been well receired: 'Definitely and Indignantly rejected the idea, that Ibn 3aud' b proposal and his acceptance of same, meant that Kuwait ^ money claims against Mejd in respect of Akhwan raids could be washed out. 'What, he said, Bin Saud was obTiously thinking about, and what he Mmself certainly understood by the proposal, was that the number of ^ad' Mejd Bedouin camel claims against Kuwaitis and Tice versa become so numerous of late that it was time some steps were taken to stop them. 11 h ' J (Vide paragraphs 2 and 3 of Colonel Diekson T s reply of 7th h* I S' JW April which together with Sir Hugh Biscoe's oommunications A a' were forwarded under my printed letter Mo. 38 (jjo. 625-8 to Government of India and Jedda) dated the 6th September 19 32). There the matter rested until raised by His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, in his telegram Ho. 169 of 25th August 1932 to the foreign Office (Mo. 227 to Bushire). 5. With regard to the merits of the case as presented by the two parties—Ibn Saud and the Shaikh—there seems no doubt/^ s A doubt vhateyer that the latter^ contention Is correct, and that both parties intended the agreement to corer only the minor claime indicated in Colonel Dickson^ letter of the 7th April 1952* The Bhaiich would never , hare accepted His Majesty 1 a proposal if it had been otherwise. Moreoyer, as Colonel Diclcson points out in Jp ( 0 « paragraph 4 of his letter Mo. 153, dated 9th September 1932(copy forwarded to you under ay printed letter So. 42 (Ho. 659-8 to the aoyernment of India and Jedda), dated 13th September 1932), Zbn Saud could not haye known of the Shaikh's Akhwan claims in January last when he made his proposal. In paragraph 3 of the same letter Colonel Dickson produces some further arguments based on the Arabic phraseology used: for instance the expres sion ♦♦between our subjects and your subjects* 1 , no mention oeing made as to the claims as between the two GoTernments* This latter argument is slightly weakened by the fact that in the aboTe statement (forwarded to you under Sir Hugh Biscoe 1 s despatch Mo, 11, dated 13th May 1931 (copy to the Government of India and Jedda under printed letter Mo. 267-a), Claim 1(a) consists almost entirely of losses by Kuwait subjects in camels, sheep, etc. Mevertheless, taking all the circumstances into account, I am sure that any court, having regard particularly to the intentions of the parties concerned at the time of the claims, would give an award in favour of the shaikh. Unfortunately we are not dealing with an individual subject to a court of law, but with an independent ei vereign. ihc, e ^ that at the time of the agreement 11m Baud's intentions were the same as the Shaikh's will not presumably prevent the former from continuing to use his present interpretation, which has sufficient plausibility for his purpose, as a trump card of consideraole value. By/By It not only will he probably avoid, or at least post pone, the meeting of the lie J d-Kuwait Blockade Commission 9 about which he appears to be less than luJce-warm y on the grounds put forward by yuad Hamza: u it %a no use con cluding further agreements if such agreements are not respeotedlf (Jedda Saving Telegram Mo« 11, paragraph 2 (Mo. 4 to Bush ire) of 2&amp;th Augu b ^, but he also may be able —at all events to his own satisfaction—-to refute entirely the A)chwaB claims, which now—even as a bargaining counter—«ay cease to have much, if any, value. At least s^ch is my reading of the situation, 'fie v*io sups with the devil fcust have a long spoon 11 , and 1 am afraid that His Sxcellency is no matchjfor Mis Majesty. We can only, I suppose, put forward the ahaiJch^ reading of the agreement to Ibn Baud as cogently as possible. The ShaiJch, however, though he has my sympathy, by his own action in not making his intentions clearer in his letter, and by his continuing to believe in the good faith of Ibn Saud even after being warned by Colonel Dickson, has made the task a difficult one. With regard to the loans at the time of operations against Hail, which His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, reports In his telegram that His Majesty accepts,tiiough contending they were a 'gift 1 * These are detailed in Claim II of the Afchwan claims, and according to paragraph 7 of Colonel ^ T&gt;i ^ ^ - Dickson 1 s letter Mo« 55 of 7th May 1951 (forwarded under Colonel Biscoe's despatch Mo. 11 of 13th May 1931 referred to above) are clearly loans not gifts, the Shaikh having documentary evidence to this effect in his possession* Ibn Saud presumably recognises this fatft, hence his generous offer to pay.

I have, etc., (Sd.) iS.R .Ludlow-Hewitt. Acting High Commissioner for Iraq, (Copy with copy of enclosure forwarded to the Political Agent,Kuwait, under P.L.No.768-S of 14/10/32;, The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister, G ,B .iS .,P.C.,M,C. f M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.I.A Note on the presertot position of Trade 'between Iraq and Najd. Trade between Iraq and Najd is restricted almost entirely to the sales and purchases of goods made by caravans sent into Iraq by the Najdi tribes. The tribes send into Iraq to sell fats, wool and other products of their camel herds and take away dates, rice, wheat» barley, tea, sugar, cloth and other manufactured articles# This trading is called musabilah. The Iraqi towns to which Najdi caravans chiefly resort ar3 Zubair, Nasariyah, Samawa and Najaf. Iraqi merchants do not send caravans of goods into Najd to trade. The restrictions which the Najdi Government iraposes on Najdi caravans trading with Iraq have generally one or both of the following objjDcts in view;- (i) to raise revenue by imposing a tax on caravans returning to Najd, This tax takes the place of the customs levied by more advanced administration. (ii) to punish a tribe. A tr be suffers much hardship if denied musabilah in Iraq. The formand degree of the restriction on control imposed by the Najdi Government on trade with Iraq varies from time to time and pb the Iraqi Goverranent are not informed of the orders issued by the Najdi Government in this regard it is always difficult to know precisely what the position is. The following is the latest information available but it should be noted that the present time is not the busy/iu u busy musa'bilah season. This occurs in the Autumn after the new date crop is ripe. The Shammar and 3hafir from Najd are now it seems free to tr^de with Iraq but the l!utair and Earb are forbidden musabilah with Iraq. Recently however in order to obtain Harb assistance against Ibn Rafada the ban on the Harb was apparently temporarily suspended. The Najdi Government inqpose a tax of 3 Najdi Riyals (about 3 rupees) on every loaded camel returning to Najd from Iraq. This is a heavy tax representing about 50^ of the value of a camel load of barley &gt; 30^ of a load of wheat and 30% of a load of dates. ?ixed routes have been laid down for caravan traffic with Iraq. Caravans trading with Zubair and Kasariyah have to use the route via Hafar, those resorting to Samawa and Najaf the route via Lina. It has been reported th^t several caravans which hnve endeavoured to evade these ord rs have been captured and their goods confiscated by Najdi frontier patrols.98124/32 11.

Downing Street, 14 December, 1932, t • rf Sir, I have the honour to refer to your confidential despatches Nos,42 and 43 of the 13th and 17th September regarding the claims of the Sheikh of Kuwait against King Ibn Saud.and to inform you that the matter has been considered in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India. 2, On consideration of the information contained in the enclosures to your despatches, it appears that there is at any rate room for doubt whether the Sheikh's view as to the correct significance of the correspondence which passed between himself and Ibn Saud in January and February last is sufficiently well founded to enable His Majesty's Government to press this view upon Ibn Saud with any great prospect of success. If this is the case, it is not uriiieLy that the only result of taking up the matter officially with the Saudi Government would be to postpone indefinitely the appointment of the proposed commission which is to endeavour to secure a settlement of the blockade question, 3, The strength of the Sheikh's case appears to depend upon the exact meaning of the Arabic terras used in THE HONOURABLE THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PlCRSIAN GULF,in thffl corrQPT )ondenc(» # If i 4 Is certain i^et the only r^ascnable int i rprf?tR'tion of there t^r &gt;3 liinits the correspondence to bad or doubtful ciai is f'lid also to claims between the nfitionalftg as distinct fro tLe Gov rnments , of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, t e^n would oe a stronger case for taking up the point officially vith Ibn Saud, but in that event it is suggested t&gt; at it would be mora appropriate and more likely to oe successful il the Sheikh himcslf explained to Ibn Saud his interpretation of th« correspondence. 4, Thin course would appear to have several advantages. In the first place, the Sheikh could speak more authoritatively than 3 r.Hope Gill on this question of the precise meaning of certsin local Arabic terms® Secondly, it seems fitter that the Sheikh and the King should themselves settle the misunierstanvin^: as to the significance of letters exchanged between them. Thirdly, from the tactical point of view the King appears from pEst experience far more likely &gt;.0 yicla t..rscetfully in such a iiiattar if approached direct by the bheikh tyian if the question is made the subject oi diplomatic correspondence with His ■ ajesty's Govern ent. kor^over, if this suggestion is out to the Sheikh,the nature of his reply will go a long way to indicate whether he is in fact convinced that the words in dispute can rightly beer only the interpretation whioh he has put forward, or whether, in explaining the matter to Lieutenant Colonel Dickson, he was, as seems at lepst possible, overstating his case.5, On the other h ^nd, if there is any real doubt as to the correctness of the interpretation of the oorresoonoenc^, there aii-rht ha an advantage in at once dropping such of the clairaa as are not admitted by King Ibn Baud t namely ?5ll except the clni ris in respect of money nnd aiJPT »li ^8 advanced by the -heikh to the King in 1^19-1920, and i aJcing such use as ay be possible of this concession in ord ^r to secure an understanding froia the King that he will fscilitPte the consideration of the questions orislng out of the blockade of iuwait^ 6, I shall ue glad if you will re -exa dnc the matter in the light of t e eons! erations aivanced in thi !e8patch # and fvjrnish me with your views on t v ve alternative courses now su^g-stev• 1 &gt;iave the honour to be.

In continuation of my telegram No.122, dated the 19th June 1953, I have the honour to forward trans lations of the following letters for your information and that of His Majesty's Government 'A' Letter No.68, dated the 7th Safar 1352 (23rd May 1933), from E.M.King Abdul Aziz al Saud to H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait: n B n Letter No.3 /l026-R,dated...(actual date will be given when letter issues) from H.S. the'Shaikh of Kuwait to H»M. Abdul Aziz al Saud: ^C' Letter No. Nil, dated the 15th Ramadhan 1348 (14.2.1930) from H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to H.M. King Abdul Aziz al Saud. 2. In forwarding the above letters I beg to offer the following explanatory remarks:- (a) Letter 'A' came via Bahrain and was received by West bound aeroplane, which arrived at Kuwait on 15th June. It was typewritten In Arabic but was so badly expressed and so obscurely worded that it took H.E. the Shaikh two whole days to study before he could understand the meaning, and myself five days (working with three trans lators) before I was able to get out a suitable C i % Cg,suitable translation that would make sense. (b) The Shaikhs reply to the King, as sent to you, has at the time of writing not been actually des patched yet. The Shaikh on leaving for Bahrain on 18.6.35. left the draft with his Secretary with orders that he should dhow it to me, get any sug gestions that I had to make incorporated, and send it after him to Bahrain by the Air Mail of 22nd June 1933, when it would be sent to Bin Saud after the Shaikh had finally approved and signed it 0 Actually the only advice I gave was to the effect that the Shaikh should be extra careful of the wording of his letter, and that he would do well to point out to the King, that he could not raise his sea customs without reference to His Majesty's Government, owing to the existence of a treaty, drawn between him and ^ A His Majesty's G-overnment to this effect. I thought it would be as well to let the King know this if in deed he is not aware of it already. (c) Letter 'C' has been included with fA.' and n B n above, because the Shaikh has referred to it in his communication to the King. The particular piece of history connected with this letter is as follows:- Immediately after the collapse of the Akhwan rebellion in the Spring of 1930, and after the meeting between the late Lt.-Col.Sir Hugh Biscoe and the King at Khabari Watha, the latter, in evident good mood at having got His Majesty's Government to assist him, and especially at having had the rebel- leaders handed over to him, wrote to Shaikh Hafith Wahba, who had repaired to Kuwait, and told him to offer three conditions to the Shaikh of Kuwait, anyone of which, if accepted, would be the signalsignal for him, the King, to raise the blockade. These 3 conditions summarized shortly were as fol lows : - r r The Hing to establish one central customs post, near the frontier and inside Nejd territory and any Nejd merchant going up to Kuwait to buy goods to report al^jf the post on his inward and outward journey. Such merchant to have from his Government a document saying what goods he could purchase fran Kuwait. The Shaikh for his part to guarantee that the merchant only took out of the Town what was mentioned in the pennit. (ii) The ^ing to establish a customs post at -ubaihiyeh wells (10 miles inside Kuwait terri tory) and all Nejdis to visit Kuwait free of interference and the Shaikh to guarantee that each caravan tribal or otherwise would be con veyed under guard on its return journey to the post, where duty would be taken. (iii) The Shaikh to pay a lump sum annually to the i^ing, the amount to be mutually agreed upon. he shaikh, it seems, regrottod conditions (ii) anc viii), but wrote to the King accepting (i). ihe King would appear to have thereupon changed his mind, probably because he saw the settlement of the Blockade in sight, a thing he had never wanted. He struck camp and went to as ianurah to meet --ing Faisal and never replied to the Shaikhs letter, nor even referred to it in the subsequent blockade conversations with the late Lt.-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe, held at Hoffuf in uhe Spring of 1952, at which the writer was present.Note, It seems that the above negotiations were carrier out in secret, for, until he was told the story by the Shaikh*s Secretary on 20th June 1935, the writer was unaware of the exchange of the letters in question or that Shaikh Hafith was carrying on private negotiations. 3. The Shaikh in his present reply 'B' to the 2 0 ' King's recent letter reminds His Majesty of his letter written on the 15th Hamadhan 1348 (14.2,1950) and says that while he cannot raise his sea customs to that of the King's Hassa posts for reasons which he explains, he is still willing and ready to agree to the King* s original proposal as mentioned in 2(c)(i) above, or failing that to the placing of a string of Nejd Customs posts along the Kuwait-Nejd frontier: Further that he is prepared to cooperate to the best of his power by means of ^'mani fest' or other suitable system, provided the King will fall in with either of his counter proposals. 4 o in a lengthy interview, which I had with T : T .J. the Shaikh on the 18th June 1933, and at which Bin Sauds letter was the subject of discussion, the Shaikh gave it as his considered opinion, that the -^ing had written his letter out of nervousness, because, to ime his words 'Ke had been given the 'tip' by his Minister in London to make some move in the matter of the blockade before -is Majesty* s Government, who were contemplating bringing pressure to bear on him t could act' With this view I am inclined to agree. 5, The Shaikh was very definitely of opinion that the King had made his letter confused, gaxded, and definitely obscure of set purpose and to confuse issues, and that he as determined as ever to make no change in the situation. The only one clear point, whichwhich stood out in the King's letter was the proposal that Kuwait should raise her sea customs to that of the King's Hassa ports* This, according to the Shaikh was a ridiculous suggestion and was obviously put forward in the clear knowledge that it would be n turned down'. Clearly if it were adopted all Kuwait trade would be diverted South in a very short time seeing that the freight to Kuwait from India was already considerably higher than that from India to Ojair or Jubail via Bahrain, and on top of freight charges and equalized cus toms rates Bin Saud proposed taking the 'Khawa' tax of Rs.3/- per camel going from Kuwait into the interior• The number of these camels in Shaikh Mubaraks time is said to have numbered some SQOOO per annum and they paid approximately Rs.240,000/- in ^Khawa' tax, which fell on I 'f'yM/ Y the shoulders of Nejd merchants. A 6 f I asked the Shaikh whether he thought the King's letter was, possibly, a forerunner to one dealing with the 'Neutral Zone' and the American Oil Interests in Hassa. He replied that he thought not, but that it was a possibility. He then laughingly declared that he could not understand any Oil Company applying for an Oil Con cession in Bin Sauds dominions to-day, when there was no guarantee what the future would bring: For, clearly, he said, if the King died to-morrow, there would be general anarchy and then where would the Oil Company be who had its works in Hassa. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. VSS. ^rs Tt A Tt /?&gt; Copyj in translation, of a letter No»68, dated the 7th Safar 1352 (23rd May 1933) from His Majesty King Ibn Saud to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed A1 Jabir As- Subah, - L . G . I . j ],, Ruler of Kuwait* O 0o — I iiope you are perfectly well and enjoying the best of health. Brother! Llay God bless thee: It is long since I desired to talk about a certain matter, but fearing that communications would lead to no success, thereby losing all hopes, I was inclined to think that matters would be best settled without referring them to you. You are undoubtedly aware of our relations, both during the past and at present: They are things that can not be explained. Now, :'ay God preserve thee, things have long been delayed^ and the world, may the Almi^ity God protect us both from its evils - is only mortal and so are its people. That this affair of ours (the Kuwait Blockade) should exist between our two countries and two families, and for us to give it no proper attention, is neither beneficial nor advantageous; although of course you must know that it is to my real interests that this matter (the Blockade) should never be settled, and this fact, we presume, is quite clear to you as well as to others. ^That I have expressed below is my opinion, and it is for you to safeguard your interests if you think it necessary for you to do so. But if it is clear that both our interests are involved then thanks be to Him, for the family is one and our countries are likewise one. I pray God that you will never stand in need of our help. If it (an agreement between us) is in the inte rests of your country, you should look into the matter,m - 2 - \S- matter, because I see things are 'shaky* in certain quar ters. We are not after the wealth of the world, but (it is clear that) with the scanty quantities of imported goods (from other directions), and present (internal) conditions generally, my country would be clearly ruined and put in critical situation, if the door of trade were opened without conditions. This is what we ourselves perceive. Nevertheless it would be a bereavement and loss of our rights were we to revert back to what has been going on heretofore. If we were to Itt matters run as they are, and remained patient, it would mean that we should be broaden ing the gulf. Therefore we propose, subject to your agree ment, the following two ways of solving the problem:- 1. That there should be a unification of yours and our customs (i.e. that you should raise your sea customs to the same figure as ours): 2# That we for our part - and indeed we are entitled to do so more than they - should collect such duties on land caravans going into Nejd, as used to be taken (in the old days i.e.'KHAHA') by A1 Dawish, (Mutaii) Ibn Rashid, Ibn Duwaihi, (Jjhaflr) etc. If such were to happen we also for our part would be prepared to offer you a guarantee for all and sundry (i.e. guarantee the safety of Kuwait goods and caravans going into the interior). If we can settle this matter secretly between ourselves, it will be well and good for both our names and the interests of both our countries. 7e should not listen to the words of those who are deceivers and have bad intentions in this matter. There are two picture that will always strike a bad minded person. He willa A ■vV A / - 3 - will either say that Ibn Saud desires to get control of Kuwaitj whereas Kuwait has not been born since the Saudian regime came into being, but has existed long before. Kuwait always comes to the rescue of the A1 Saud, and so do the A1 Saud fly to the help of the Kuwaitians. And even were there no obstacle in our way (i.e. of attacking and taking possession of Kuwait), By God ( we would not do so) for we have no ill will towards Kuwait nor its inhabitants, from its northern limits to its southern limits. Moreover it is not in our interests to do this. And added to everything we may mention that the people inhabiting Kuwait are more dear to us than our very souls. And more over we fully realize the present sad conditions prevailing in Kuwait. Then there is another matter, I refer to that Government (His Majesty * s Government). May God protect us from her evils. At the moment she is on friendly terms with us, but we greatly fear the consequences ( of her friendship with us). My reasons for saying this are many, but my proofs are clear as the sunshine. It is said by some that if the Kuwait Customs Duties were enhanced, imports would decline. '.That I say is that Kuwait cannot decline more than she has done already, even though some people think otherwise. After studying the Kuwait situation from all its angles, your brother feels bound to make mention of the fol lowing last two points, instead of (as he originally intended) only giving you a hint, or communicating the matter to you through some one else. They are as follows (a) Efforts from both of us are necessary if Nejd and Kuwait are both to be assisted: (b) You, my dear Brother, and my dear people of Kv ait must be made to understand my present state (i.e. the finan- ii' 1 'I a %:■ I. ■ IMS i I A ir^ • 4 . financial straits that I am in) which has lead me to pen you this. Remember that my strength is your strength and my weakness is your weakness. I have no other alternative to offer: It must be either 'Iltizam' (i.e.Guarantee of safety of caravans going into Nejd) or n Nothing Tt , which latter would put me in a critical position (financially). Neither you nor any Muslim Arab would ever, I think, like such a situation to arise (bankruptcy). After saying what I have said, I hope, by the Grace of God Almighty, that the door of happiness will be opened and the wound in my heart healed. I swear by the God of both Heaven and Earth, that I intended nothing by my writing. It has neither sinister political meaning, nor do I wish to teach you your business. My words are those from a brother to his brother; from a father to his son; from a friend to his friend; andfrom a sufferer to his body. I trust you do not mind what I have said above. If the foregoing is not acceptable, your brother will not take offence. It will be out of friendship and kindness, if you accept what I propose; and will be due to your noble character, and for the advantage of all. Salams to all the brothers and sons. •oOoCopy, in translation, of letter No,3/l026-R dated •♦•(actual date will be given 'when letter issues) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed A1 Jabir As-Subah, K.C.I.S,, C^S.I», Huler of Kuwait to His Majesty King 11511 3aud - / (^^9- ^6v ( ^ • 4/3/m /i 1 * ooo—--- / / I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed favour, for y/hich I thank you. The friendly tone of your letter under reply coupled with the fatherly sentiments expressed therein, are all due to your Majesty^ nobility, I ask God that as long as Your Majesty survives, the relationship between our two houses, which are really but one body, may continue to remain satisfactory, and stand on the best footing. I fully believe that Your Majesty entertains all I that is advantageous for us, and^/also realise that your keen desire is to look after the interests of one and all. It is a well-known fact that Your Majesty places the welfare of your brother and his country (Kuwait) before that of your own private interests. May God the Almighty grant you a long life for the prosperity and progress cf all. I have no doubt at all about Your Majesty's state ment when you say that our respective families and countrfe s are one and the same. No doubt your Majesty is the oneindi- vidual capable of rendering assistance in times of prosperity and adversity. It is you alone through whom unity can be achieved. I cannot adequately express my gratitude and esteem for the manner in which you have made knovm your feeling towards your brother, and I pray that you achieve your- 2 - your alms, and that your enemies and the deceivers be defeated always• Sire, I have carefully gone through what you have been pleased to say with regard to the establishing | o. Musabalah' (permitting trade) between the two countrJes. In thanking Your Majesty I value your precious remarks, which I know are intended to be in the interests of both parties, and are the outcome of true love and kindness. With regard to what you say in the matter of _ the collecting again by Your Majesty of the duties 'Khawa^ which used to be levied in the old days by Ibn Rashid, Ad Dawish, and Bin Duwaihi: The idea is a good one, and will not be difficult of enforcement, for the people and tribes of iejd are under Your Majesty's jurisdiction, and will certainly not disobey an order that you find to be in their own interests# Your Majesty is of course far more entitled to take such duties, than the persons mentioned above were. tfith regard to the question that we should raise our sea customs to the level of yours: Your Majesty may rest assured that whenever possible, we will always be eager to do that which pleases you, as well as give your interests preference over ours. But Your Majesty cannot be unaware of the present sad state of our town, and the peculiar geographical po sition of Kuwait ( in relation to the rest of the Persian Gulf). Kuwait to-day cannot bear a heavier burden than I it now carries, both owing to the grave conditions of pover ty that exist, and also to the general financial depression prevailing. And in passing let me say that I call God to witness that I have not the slightest suspicion of Your^ Majesty's good intentions, when you make the suggestions you have, seeing that we are one family and one house. ■■f ?1 - 3 - house• Furthermore Your Majesty without doubt is fully- aware that we are in close relationship with His Liajesty^s Grovernment, the friend of all. And owing to certain agree ments which have been concluded between us it is not pos sible for us to enhance our sea customs, without a reference being made and an agreement being come to with His Majesty^s Government. In the above connection, however, I beg to take the liberty of inviting Your Majesty's attention to my let ter dated 15th Ramadhan 1346 (14.2.1930), in v?hich I beg ged Your Majesty to agree to introduce on the frontier cer tain proposals made by Your Majesty. If what was proposed, then still meets with your generous approval to-day, why, then we for our part are prepared to endeavour to make it a success, and render all assistance and help in carrying out the arrangement, provided such post be on the frentier t (and not inside our territory). Such assistance to include the submitting of statements ( to your officials) giving details of all goods exported to Nejd in particular and to other parts of Your Majesty^ dominions generally (manifest system). Lastly I take the opportunity to repeat once more my thanks and gratitude for Your Majesty's letter, and beg that your brothers views be given due and sympatnetic con sideration, thereby bestowing one more favour over and above the many good deeds already accomplished by Your Majesty. It is with deepest respects^Sire, that I submit my above counter proposals and I tnust Your Majesty will find them not difficult of acceptance. other In the event, however, of your having any /proposals or suggestions to make, such as the placing of a string of customs posts along the frontier line, within I^ejd territory } .territory, we for our part will certainly not put any dif ficulties in the way or raise objection; nay, we shall be only too pleased and grateful to render all assistance and help in carrying the proposal through and making it a success. ►—ooo-Copy, in translation, of letter dated the 15th Ramadhan 1348 ( 14.2.195 0) from His ilxcellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al- Jabir As-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait to His Majesty King Bin Saud• 1 * ooo You are aware of the stong and close relationship that existed in the past between our two families• 7e were and are still desirous of strengthening this relationship but of late,unfortunately, things have occurred which no friend can look upon with indifference. It is in the in terests of both parties that we revert back to the old state of affaiss, and that the blockade may be raised, in such a manner as will neither hurt your interests nor be the sub ject of any further ill feeling between us. Shaikh Hafiz Jfr/ahbah has brought to our notice Your Majesty's suggestions and views regarding f, Musabalah Tt and I thank your Majesty for your noble and generous feelings towards my country. We willingly agree with one of the suggestions made, namely, that Your Majesty should establish a single post on the fron tier within the territory of Nejd, from which passes would be issued to those persons who wish to cone to Kuwait and make purchases. Further we are prepared to consider any other sug gestions on these linet that Your Majesty may be pleased to make.COOTrDBRTIAI.. Mo.45 of 1933.

This increase in the tariff will naturally furnish a greater incentive for smuggling into Saudi Arabia and it seems to me likely that this consideration may have prompted Ihn Saud to make his recent suggestion to the Shaikh of Kuwait ( vide my Printed letter No«44 (Ho.757-S to the Government of India and Jedda) of 27th June 19 33) that the customs tariff of Kuwait should he raised to the level of that of Saudi Arabia# 20 2.* I am sending copies of this letter to the Government of India and His MaJ esty^ Minister t Jedda# 1 I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Lieut.-Colonel, JPolitical Resident in the ^ersian Gulf.
