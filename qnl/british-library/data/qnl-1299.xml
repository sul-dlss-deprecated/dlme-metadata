Ist no, 69S. In course of interviews with Shaikh Mubarak and conversation regarding his property at Iaadaghiyeh I have elicited the following:- Shaikh h'is not yet inade acquaintance of present Wali, 'but previously he had been assured by each Wali in succession, that the Porte were prepared to grant him a farm an, by which they would guarantee to maintain existing position and entirely abstain from interfering wither in the Gotrb. or affairs of Kuwait,, provided that he would comply with their desires by taking out Turkish papers for his sons These overtures he had always rejected , he said, in the first place because in his belief we wished him to reject them, and in the second place because he had. opined that we should by virtue of our agreement •with him arrive in due course at a settlement of the difficulty regarding property question on other lines. It was his personal belief that ^Tif he registered his sons and thus placated the Turks^so far as his property in urkey 'was concerned he would in future receive fair play. With regard to the ultimate poss^- « Nihility of such registration leading to interference by Turkey despite his firman, he would not apprehend, he •'said, such a contingency, in his .own case. lie felt more jver that. Kuwait was safeguarded by our engagements he ^was with himself; / iaowever ft# of ©pinion that future possibil- -ities in this respect could be gti^ged /%$£// much oetter by the British Government than by himself! and felt tn^^J our estimate of tfesm must be accepted by him. The Shaikh however replied In the affirmative to myf oTiestion wiiether considered that, , in. the event of the readiness of the Porte to grant a farman couched in satisfactory temrs, his security would 'be quite assured by our obtaining from the Porte a document by which /ruy&gt; ' they engaged themselves to observe the farman strict y. /\ It would seem as if the above procedure woula provide sufficient recognition of Turkish suzerainty and ^ppsorently as long as our existing engagements with the Shaikh hold good axtd are reaffirmed, he would not resent it. : Referring to the-question of payment of tribute by the Shaikh, which has been suggested, I believe I an correct In saying that tribute has never been paid by the Shaikhs of Kuwait. The honorary title of ^aim -maqari, and^in ca^es of emergency., voluntary cooperation by the Shaikh such as that rendered in 1371 to Midhat Pasha, together with the receipt annually from the authorities at Basrah of a compiim^ntary present, of date^have been the only indications o f the ■ dependence of the Shaikhs on Turkey. In 1808 those outwara signs ceased, and they might now be tacitly resumed-! but the Shaikh would grea .uly resent any suggestion of the payment of tribute, in addition to which such -payment would appear unneceasary and not expected by the Turks. ' The worst possible impression would also be created among the other Arab Shaikhs in relation with us by such a step, and I aeprecate it earnestly. As to suggestion (4) it is presumed that .effective control on shore as weifel as afloat^such as xs exercised fcy us in igyp^is Keant by'control of port . Were that lacking, in my judgment impracticabilities without numfeer woAld beset the position^ more partt^uls so ^if our control did not extend over the last section of the railway.luimhumh Questions or exterritoriality amd other such difficulties would inevitably supervene once Kuwait had 'becore the railway terminus, and developed inx-o a large coTnmercial port frequented by foreign firms, and the crude regime of the Shaikh would need to be replaced by a more civilized administration. Such administrata!on must be under the supervision of the British Government who on behalf of the Shaikh would deal with foreign powers. The stipulations that Bubiyan, Jm Kasr and Warbah be recognized as being in the sphere of control of the Shaikh, and the present Turkish guards there removed 'should be included in any form of recognition of Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait. The further condition that the recognition of suzerain^j was specifically contingent on a definite decision to make the terminus of the railway at Kuwait would also seem to be essential. In the absence thereof it might be said by Geriiany, after she had brought about this recognition by Great Britain that on further conai-.eration the most convenient position for the terminus was decided to be eithe lao or ,Basrah, -pofey'the * possibility that we might find it necessary to dredge the bar by reason of tTie requirements of the oil trade or the railway from Mohammerah to Julfa before the Baghdad railway reache s th e Gulf , must be rrept^in-view-r Lastly, the Turks will clearly not consent to the Trans ference of the large customs i na transit duties now realized by them at Basrah to the Shaikh of Kuwaitis pockets, nor will the latter allow the Turks no take the bul^( of the revenue from the Kuwait customs. It will be essential then to arrange a fair division if Kuwait amd not Basrah is to be the terminus, ana the selection of the terminus would appear to depend mainly on this c ons i der at i on, If the opening of the railway negotiations is not likely to be deferred for long, I consider the settfe of the Tadaghia question agmits of being deferred ti 1TW^' 4o^/v i THE POTSDAM MEETING. FRANCE AND RIFAAT PASHA'S STATEMENT. (from oub own coerespondent. ) PARIS, J an. 2!!. The first accounts of Rifaat Pasha's statement in the Ottoman Chamber yesterday have attracted considerable attention in France, especially the Turkish Foreign Minister's refe rences to the declarations which were made to the Porte by the German Ambassador with regard to the scope of the Russo-German Agreement. It is noted that Rifaat Pasha stated that ' Germany recognizes the special interests of Russia in Northern Persia,' and that this fact does not signify that Germany disputes Turkish interests in Persia. The Temps this evening observes that, if the German Ambassador at Constantinople declared to the Porte that Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Agreement as published by a London evening journal were incorrectly reproduced, the only fuit^rej^ic portion of 'the ipufoVphed text would tie Article 1, relating to Russia's attitude with regard to the Baghdad Railway. In the opinion of your Paris contemporary, ' it remains to be seen whether Baron von Marschall's denial applies, as we believe, only to the form and letter of the text published in London, or whether it likewise applies to the substance of that publication.' The Temps learns independently from Constantinople that, according to some accounts, the German Ambassador denied the authenticity merely of Articles 3 and 4, in which Germany pledges herself not to promote the construction of railways north of Khanikin and recpgnizes Russian interests in Persia. Article 2, the authenticity of which, according to these local accounts. Baron von Marschall did not deny, relates to the linking up of the Baghdad Railway with the Persian railway system via Sadidje and Khanikin. It is further pointed out that, while Rifaat Pasha declares that the' German Ambassador has denied the authenticity of Article 4 of the published text, the Turkish Foreign Minister states that Germany recognizes the special interests of Russia in Northern Persia. But the recognition of these interests by Germany is precisely the purport of Article 4. THE DEBATE IN THE TURKISH CHAMBER. CONSTANTINOPLE, J an . 22.» The debate in the Chamber yesterday on the Potsdam interview was opened by the Syrian Deputy, Shefik Mayyad, who provoked frequent rnterruptiona owing to the nature of his speech. The President was obliged to intervene to correct an expression he used—namely, ' the Arab Khalifa to,' remarking ' There is only one Khalifate, namely the Islamic.' The correction was greeted with a salvo of applause, in which the Arab Deputies joined. The next speaker was Ferid Bey, who, in an able speech which was warmly applauded, re viewed the whole position. He criticized the apparent apathy of the Government in a ques tion of vital importance to the country, and pointed to the Potsdam interview as wounding the national amour propra. Quoting a recent publication of the alleged text of the Russo- German understanding, he argued that it was a consequence of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 and resembled that agreement. He sub mitted that the recent declarations of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, the German Ambassa dor, contradicted nothing, while Russia had remained silent. Rifaat Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, thereupon read a statement to the following effect;—- The Potsdam interview, to judge from what had become known, exclusively concerned the recognition of Russia's special interest in Northern Persia by Germany,wliile safeguarding the open door and the junction of the Khanikin Baghdad line with the prospective railway in Northern Persia and the maintenance of the status quo. M. Sazonoff had made a similar declaration to the Ottoman Ambassador in St. PeterBburg. Subsequently, however, the publi cation of the alleged Russo-German Agreement had aroused doubts, but the assurances of Baron von Marschall, who had promised to supple ment them in a couple of days, had calmed their fears. Rifaat Pasha added that the integrity of Persia was a matter of capital importance to | Turkey. The Russo-German pourparlers were 1 continuing, but Turkey did not admit that the 1 upshot would inflict injury upon her rights and sentiments. M The Minister denied the existence of pourti fbarlers between Germany and Great Britairi fen the subject of the Baghdad Railway, adding; Ihat, according to an assurance received, such; pourparlers would only take place with Turkey. ■ T he P ersian G ulf. Referring to the rumours concerning the position in the Persian Gulf, Rifaat Pasha de clared that the integrity of Turkey's sovereign rights in those regions was unquestionable. The relations of Turkey and Great Britain were marked by the greatest cordiality, and the questions that might exist between the two countries would be solved by negotiations based on mutual confidence, not by newspaper articles. Summing up, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there had been no decision at Potsdam in reference to Turkey's political and economic interests or the military position in the eastern Erovmces of Asia Minor, and that Germany, aving recognized Russia's interests in Northern Persia, could not be regarded as not recognizing Turkey's important interests in the same country. He declared that he would gladly accept' the co-operation of foreign capital for the construction of railways, but he desired to prevent economic undertakings from developing into zones of political influence. He assured the Chamber that all enterprises not conform ing to the above essential rule would be rejected. The statement was received with applause.

Turkey and the Bagdad Railway, Now that Russia has withdrawn her oppo- .sition to tbo Bagdad Railway and has made ten us with Germany in the Near East we are broi Tht a stage nearer to the problem of the proposed tenniaus of the railway on the Pensi m €rulf. As long as we could eqiint on the Ui ited support of- Russia and France wo were content with a waiting policy. Railways cannot be built merely by graiitittg oouces- sione, and while the purses of Europe were shi against the Bagdad Railway fcharc was always the prospect of compromise under financial pressure. Germany has micceeded 'in loosing the' puree strings. That is-one effect of the Russo-German agreement. Nothing can be gained by pretending to ignore it. Great Britain must soon face the situation and ■ us-t decide whether or not she will consent to have a Gerir an railway terminus on the Persian Gulf and the flank of India. This is a ques tion that ritally concerns our imperial and commercial interests, and until the people of this countr ■ recognise its supreme importance there is danger of drifting into ' a - position from which it-will be difficult to-extricate our selves peacefull-. Our present ' losition is plain. While we •knowledge thv suzerain rights of the Otto man Governmeit over Koweit, the proposed terminus of the railway on. the Persian Gulf, we claim both t eaty and prescriptive rights ver this littor 1. These rights have been uii-ed by raor &gt; than a century of effort and critiee in mafi Gaining the peace of the Gulf. The Britisii ^-ernment has neither the wish nor the intention to deny the interests of Turkey in this remote fringe, ofVhs Ottoman Empire. That is cleftriv established by the fact, recorded by our correspondent in Con- srfentinopie yesterday, that tho British Government is prepared to accept the good offices of the Ottoman Government in solving the problem of,'the terminus. From the stand point of interpatkmal law the Bagdad Railway is a Turkish railway leased so Germany for a number of years and under certain conditions. It is therefore to the interests of the Ottoman Empire to see thalj the terminus is an effective terminus and that the success of the railway is not imperilled by a bittej- international dis pute between Great Britain and Germany. The Turkish Government has the power, if it has the 'will, to, clear the way for a settlement. The moment is opportune, and we hope that the Government in Constantinople will respond without delay to our friendly invitation.JTn '— 197 . Foreign Office has been more than once conveyed to Berlin. But apart from commercial considerations, Great Britain has a big political stake in the Baghdad Rail- way, and the German Government know by this time that this side of the question cam.ot be ignored without endangering the whole project of a through trunk line from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf. The railway when constructed will open up an alternative route from Europe to India, and this fact alone invests the project with an international interest of first importance. Further than this, Great Britain has by force of circum stances acted for the past 100 years as policeman in the Gulf for the whole world, and however much we may wish to get rid of our responsibility in this respect we cannot do so without dislocating all those accumulated arrangements under which the riparian chiefs, from Muskat to Basra, are permitted to administer their terri tories on condition that they keep the peace between themselves, abstain from piracy, and give up the traffic in slaves. It is in this sense that the Persian Gulf has become an English preserve, in which poaching cannot be allowed without disturbance of those harmonious relations which we have established among the wild tribes on both sides of this great international water way. The Tanin is crying 'Hands off!' to England on the plea that the railway will run its whole course from the Bosphorus to the head of the Persian Gulf on Turkish soil; but this is not so. As far as Baghdad, and possibly, though not certainly, as far as Basra, Turkish sovereignty is indisputable; but Basra is sixty miles np Now that Russian opposition to the Baghdad railway the Shatt-el-Arab river, at the mouth of which there is has been overcome and a Russian agreement made a bar with barely ten feet of water at low tide, and with regarding the future junction of the projected (Russian) not more than eighteen feet at high water. The railway Teheran-Kermanshaw railway with a branch of the must, therefore, be taken to the coast, but beyond Basra Baghdad line at Khanikin, it is high time that England Turkish sovereignty has never been recognised by the and Germany should agree about an extension of the ruling Sheikh either of Muhammerah or of Koweit, trunk line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. Such an with both of whom we have what are practically offensive agreement w 1 ' 11 be easier made now than when the and defensive alliances which are as binding on the German railway has reached Baghdad, and when con- Sheikhs and ourselves as are the secret stipulations of flicting international interests will be accentuated by the Triple Alliance binding on Germany. In the case of being brought into close practical propinquity. As Koweit, at the request of Sheikh Mubarak in 1898, pointed out last week in Truth , the Russian Govern- when Abdul Hamid threatened to dispossess him of his ment would have facilitated an all-round settlement if sovereign powers, a formal treaty was drawn up placing they had insisted on representatives of the other two the Sheikhdom under British protection on condition Triple Entente Powers being invited to the Potsdam that its foreign relations were handed over to the British Conference; but after all Russia must take care of Resident-General in the Persian Gulf. This being the herself, and the agreement which she has concluded with case, it is quite certain that effect cannot be given to Germany only concerned her own interests without Article xxiii. of the Baghdad Railway Convention of giving away those of France and England. . 1903, by which the Porte conceded to the German What it is important for the Germans to understand company the right to establish a terminus on the Persian is that England and France are ready to negotiate on Gulf, without the joint consent of one of the two Sheikhs perfectly friendly terms, and with a bona fide desire to mentioned and of the British Government. This con- assist Germany in getting the railway through to sent can, of course, be bought for a price, which it is Baghdad, and afterwards to Koweit, with the least now believed.Germany is willing to pay. possible delay, and at the cheapest possible cost. But All authorities agree that Koweit is the best point for before French and English capital become available for the Eastern terminus of the railway, and what now this purpose there must be an agreed undertaking that remains is for Germany, Turkey, and England to come the railway is not to be used for the commercial advan- to an understanding under which the Gulf section of tage of any one nation, or group of nations, to the exclu- the line which passes through a British protectorate of French, English, and other people who may wish shall be constructed out of British capital and worked to j the line. To come to the point, and without under British control, the same guarantees being given beating further about the bush, what is required is an for commercial internationalisation as for the German- assurance on the part of Germany that the railway will built sections of the line. This would enable the railway be commercially internationalised. M.

J Turkish policy since the Revolution has 'loeea , subject to such frequent and abrupt fluctuations that wo are not disposed for the present to attach much importance to the revulsion of feeling caused at Constantinople by the Russo- German negotiations.

The Sheikh of Mohammerah does not owe even nominal allegiance to the Sultan , and the Sheikh of Koweit occupies at least a semi -independent position, with which the Porte never seriously attempted to interfere until the port of Ivoweit began to be talked of as the probable terminus of the Baghdad Railway. It may be needless to remind Turkish Ministers, but it may be useful to remind some of their impetuous followers, that Turkey must reckon with the realities of a situation for which she is herself primarily responsible. Turkey, like Persia, and even more than Persia, has failed hitherto to discharge effectively in the Persian Gulf the duties that were incum bent upon her if she wished to secure the effective recognition of her sovereign rights as a riparian Power. It is we who have for a hundred years alone patrolled and policed the Persian Gulf ; we have surveyed and buoyed and lighted its chief roadsteads ; we have given to it postal and telegraphic com munications with the outer world ; we have cleared its waters of the worst forms of piracy at no slight cost of blood and treasure ; we have gradually weaned the native popula tion along its shores from their internecine feuds and reconciled them to more peaceful methods of livelihood ; and whatever effective authority Turkey exercises to-day in those regions—and the same applies to 1 orsia is due mainly to our forbearance and good will and to the self -denying ordinance under which we have refrained from seeking for our labours any territorial (omperisation. 1 hese are, roughly, the arguments upon which Lord Lansdowne based his declaration in 1903 with regard to British interests in the Persian Gulf, and to that declaration his successor lent renewed force when, at the time of the Anglo- Russian Agree nent, he secured from Russia the formal recognition of our special interests in the Gulf. We have been compelled in .the ^ past to assume in those inhospitable regions responsibilities which the Turks and others showed themselves incompetent or unwilling to discharge, and at the same time we have been, perhaps unwisely, content merely to ignore the claims put forward from time to time by the Porte to an extension of titular sovereignty of which Turkey continued in practice to repu diate all the obligations. Now that new politi- ] cal factors are being introduced with the develop ment of new means of communication it may bo well to bring all the long-pending questions connected with them to an issue and to arrive at a definite and comprehensive settlement. The Turks may rest assured that they will find this country ready to deal with them in a friendly and reasonable spirit, so long as they do not expect from us the surrender of vital interests or the abandonment of our local allies and friends.Turkey and the Persian (The Times, Thursday, Jaauarf 10.)

But, in the second i place, there are British political interests of a special nature in the Persian Gulf zone which no British Government can afford to overlook or to surrender ; and as to these, in so far as Turkey is concerned, it is with her that we must seek to arrive at an agreement. We have sufficient confidence in the statesmanship of Turkish Ministers not to impute to them any desire to ignore this aspect of the question, though the local Turkish authorities in the Baghdad and Basra Vilayets have of late frequently adopted high-handed measures, which implied h, singular disregard of even old-established Treaty rights. Eaterprising officials seem, indeed, to think that Turkey is now in a position to establish shadowy claims of sovereignty wherever they deem it con venient to put them forward, by the simple process of military occupation. Ismail Haxki Bey , the well-known Deputy for Baghdad, who enjoys considerable credit with the Com mittee of Union and Progress as an authority on foreign affairs, has delivered himself of a series of articles which cannot pass entirely unnoticed.

These are, roughly, the arguments upon which Lord Lansdowne based his declaration in 1903 with regard to British interests in the Persian Gulf, and to that declaration his successor lent renewed force when, at the time of the Anglo- Russian Agree nent, he secured from Russia the formal recognition of our special interests in the Gulf. We have been compelled in .the past to assume in those inhospitable regions responsibilities which the Turks and others showed themselves incompetent or unwilling to discharge, and at the same time we have been, perhaps unwisely, content merely to ignore the claims put forward from time to time by the Porte to an extension of titular sovereignty of which Turkey continued in practice to repu diate all the obligations. Now that new politi cal factors are being introduced with the develop ment of new means of communication it may bo well to bring all the long-pending questions connected with them to an issue and to arrive at a definite and comprehensive settlement. The Turks may rest assured that they will find this country ready to deal with them in a friendly and reasonable spirit,,so long as they do not expect from us the surrender of vital interests or the abandonment of our local allies and friends.TURKEY AND KOWETT. : fgp the claim of suzerainty. (from a correspondent.) Considerable misconception appears to prevail regarding tfle exacfc nature of the Turkish claims Oi suzerainty over the port and territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, in the Persian Gulf. In his articles in the Tctnin Ismail Hakki Bey lias declared that Koweit is officially a Turkish kaza (canton). Hussein Djahid Bey has stated in an article in the Tanin, quoted in The Times of January 26, that ' lor us Koweit is Ottoman territory.' These statements are in need of correction. The purpose of this article is to show that the Sheikh of Koweit is an inde pendent ruler, that the suzerainty of Turkey does not extend to Koweit territory, and that (ireat Britain possesses a preferential position a*^ Koweit which no other Power, not even i urkey, can impair. The facts set forth are based partly upon careful research and partly upon investigations on ths spot. Thid Stemrich Mission. Early in 1900 a German mission arrived over- land at Koweit. It was headed by Herr Stem- rich, then Consul-GeneraI at Constantinople, and afterwards Minister at Teheran, who now occupies a prominent position in the German ioreign Office. The object of his visit to Koweit was to obtain from Sheikh Mubarak a concession for a terminus for the Baghdad ilailway upon the shores of Koweit Har bour. He asked for a site at Bas Kathama, at the head of the bay, and for a, lease of 20 square miles of territory around it. It is n'ot i surprising that the request was flatly re fused. Mubarak would probably have re jected the Oei\a overtures in any case, because lie kne\y- the character of German relations with Turks, with whom he was on bad term-!. I '5, ^there was another circum stance which made refusal imperative. Almost the first administrative act per formed by Lord Curzon' after his arrival in India as \ ieeroy had been to instruct Colonel Meade, then British Keskient in the Persian Gulf, to conclude an agreement with Mubarak, the nature of which certainly precluded the i cession of any portion of his territory to any foreign Power. That agreement was signed by Colonel Meade and Mubarak at Koweit on January 23, 1899. The Sheikh received certain definite considerations in return for his acquies- j cence. The precise terms of the agreement have never been made public, though its exist-1 ence is now generally known. They are, how- j ever, sufficiently indicated by Mr. Balfour's i reference in the House of Commons on April S, 1903, to the territories of a Sheikh whom we have under our special protection, and with whom wo have special treaties ' ; and by the statement of The Times, on January 11, 1904, that Mubarak had contracted 'special treaty relations which placed his rights and interests under the a?gis of Great Britain.' In a foot note in his published version of his Romanes lecture on ' Frontiers,' Lord Curzon states -that the agreement of the Indian Government with the Sheikh of Koweit ' was tantamount to an assertion of protectorate, although . . . by a strange anomaly, the protectorate of Turkey was never formally denied.' Germany has been, in effect, warned off, and there has been no further attempt to obtain preferential advantages at Koweit. I believe 1 am nevertheless justified in saying that Mubarak would like to see the terminus at Koweit, if he could be assured of his own inde- j pendence and of the continuance of British protection. The Relations with TrsKEY.^oS^V During Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty TitrkSy , repeatedly endeavoured to obtain possession' of Koweit, over which she claimed a vague sort of suzerainty. The Turks have long sought to make fresh conquests in the Gulf, and so far back as the forties tried to secure the allegiance of Bahrein. There is reason to suppose, however, that their eagerness to seize j Koweit during the early years of Lord Curzon's rule in India was due to the belief that the harbour was the only possible terminus for the Baghdad Railway. Reams have been written about the basis of the Turkish claims to Koweit. The very origin of the Arabs of Koweit is disputed. Colonel Polly, a former Resident in the Persian Gulf, declared that they came from Um Kasr, at the head of the Khor Abdullah, 250 years ago ; but the Bombay Government Records, and the memoirs of Midhat Pasha, alike state that they came from Nedjd, and the latter theory is probably correct. The statements in the Bombay records about their relations with tho Turks are rather contradictory. It is fairly clear that throughout the 18th century the Sheikhs of Koweit were entirely independent. In 1829 Captain Brucks, of the Indian Navy, wrote that the Sheikh ' acknowledged the authority of the Porte,' and p aid a tribute of &lt;10 bags of rice and 40(; frazd-. of dates annually, fn'IS^-TEreutenant K^mbafi''irepoftcd that for 20 years Koweit had been ' considered ' to be ' closely connected' with the Pashalik of Baghdad. The Koweit vessels flew the Turkish flag, and the Sheikh received annually 200 ; karahs of date s (equivalent to 4,000 crowns) ( , m return lor wTnclV he was 756und to pro tect Bas ra f rom foreign aggression.' There is not mucE suggestion of suzeruihty or tribute j in this statement. About the same time Lieutenant Kernball made another report I in which he said that the inhabitants of Koweit ' acknowledge a nominal dependence to the j Turkish Government.' In 1853 Lieutenant Disbrowe stated that the Sheikh had ' placed himself under the guardianship of the Porte.' Colonel Felly, who visited Koweit in 1863 i and 1865, stated that the Sheikh received ; annually ' a complimentary present of dates i from Basra, in token of suzerainty and for the supposed protection of the mouths of the Basra ' River.' There is again very little | implication of tribute in this assertion. Pal- grave, not a very trustworthy witness, as he | never went to Koweit, wrote in 1863 that the Sheikh had ' refused the demands of tribute | and submission ' made by the Vali of Baghdad, i Midhat Pasha, who was Vaii of Baghdad in 1869-70, states, in the memoirs edited by his son, that the people of Koweit had success fully resisted all attempts to bring them within Turkish jurisdiction, and that they had main- i tained their ' practical independence.' He ] claims to have added their territory to the- Vilayet of Baghdad with their consent, but as he makes a similar but quite illusory statement about Bahrein, the allegation that he included Koweit witliin tho dominions of the Sultan hardly commands acceptance. Tcbkish Suzerainty a Fiction. Mv own view, after examining much more evidence than is here recorded, is that the suzerainty of the Sultan over Koweit was neve; more than a ' polite fiction.' Midhat Pasha's admission probably describes the situation tha existed all 'last century. Rulers who were abl. to protect a Turkish city in return for paymen were not likely to brook any serious exercis- of authority by the distant potentate of Con stantinople : but they doubtless tendered th Sultan that ill-defined though tangible respec which most Musulman magnates proffer t one who, whether he be Khalifa or not, is gtjj the greatest Monarch in Islam. Mubarak's own attitude is not difficult t. understand. He wishes to preserve his owi independence, and to enjoy the protection o British warships in case of need; but h knows the mutability of human affairs, am prefers to keep on good terms with his Turk is] neighbours so far as is possible. He is wel aware that differences with the Sultan do, hin liQiTrn in tlio eyes of Musu Ixntiris, tind w lien came into possession of Koweit in 1896 he evei tried by distributing bribes at Constantmopk to buy the recognition of Abdul H amid. lit has the best of reasons for wishing to preserveTurkish friendship), because he owns date groves near tao, in Turkish territory, which bring bim in £4,000 a year. He therefore thinks it policy to have a foot in each camp. He gladlj' seeks the aid of British bluejackets when bis capital is menaced, but he flies the lurkish flag as a cheap and meaningless com pliment. There is no doubt about' the flag, tor when he received me a huge Crescent and fe ar was flymg over his house. His own explana tion, though not made to me, was that be new it because it was the emblem of the Musul- man faith ; and, further, that when his ships f S1 iV. r) f ei S n harbours, it was a convenience or xern to carry a flag which was known and recognized. It is probable that the custom is really a survival of the days when the vessels ot ivoweit sailed forth to pro ect Basra from the delta 01 P rodator y tribes of the Euphrates It is perhaps doubtful whether Ivoweit will T T ^ 0m * the commercial terminus of the -Baghdad Railway. That destiny may be ! reserved for Basra, and the bar at the mouth of tne bhatt-al-Arab can bo easily dredged. But ; even under the new dispensation Turkey has ! not erased to make advances, sometimes cordial, sometimes menacing, to Koweit. In 1909 pressure was placed upon Mubarak by the cancellation, on the pretext that he was 'not a i urkish subject, of large purchases of land which ne had made in Mesopotamia. Attempts to Seize Koweit. (aw . : ' 1 e Lord Curzon was Viceroy Turkish mtngues, by direction of Abdul Hamid and | ns is believed, at the instigation of Germany, ri a ^ more definite shape. In 1900 uborak, who lias great influence with the j fillers ot Central Arabia, plunged boldly into the rivalry between the great families of Ibn Kashid and Ibn Saud, and led an army into the j interior. He was marching to the support ot - bu baud, and after more than one victory was ambushed in a ravine, and so badly de- ed that when the remnants of his force returned to Ivoweit, some of his men were rid- mg three on a horse. Abdul Hamid inune- aiately took advantage of Mubarak's plight, in 1901 a decrepit Turkish corvette, packed with troops, steamed into Koweit harbour, and its commander blandly prepared to take possession of the town. Lord Curzon was fully acquainted with the projected plot, and, with the sanction oi the Home Government, had issued explicit directions to the British naval authorities to prevent the seizure of Koweit, The corvette found the inevitable British cruiser awaiting her. and a British naval officer. Captain Pears, said a few plain words which induced the Turks to withdraw in considerable haste. The Turkish Government afterwards bad the effrontery to inform the Foreign Office that the vessel carried no troops at all. Towards the end of the year the corvette reappeared, bearing a high Turkish official, who carried an extremely threatening message from the Sultan to Mubarak. On that occasion another British naval officer,^ Captain Simons, whose ship was at Koweit, intervened upon his own responsibility—for instructions had not reached bim—and at bis bidding Mubarak ordered the Sultan's envoy to depart. The Turks were not deterred from ma; 'ng mischief, although twice driven back by the sight of British guns. They incited Ibn Kasbid to move on Koweit, which he did with great alacrity. The close of the year found throe British warships in the harbour, a British force with light guns in the fort of Jehara 18 miles inland, and British bluejackets manning hastily-prepared entrenchments outside the town. Clouds of Ibn Rashid's horsemen hovered near for some time, but the task was too formidable for them, and eventually they marched back to Central Arabia. The last definite attempt to seize Koweit was made some months later by Mubarak's nephews, assuredly with Turkish cognisance. They left the Shatt- al-Arab, where they were in exile, with a fleet of boats, which was promptly chased and dis persed by bis Majesty's ship Lapwing. j r .

[6th January.] SECRET SERIES. Section 3, [637] No. 1. Sia H. Babington Smith to Sir A. Nicolson —(Received 6th January 1911). Ban que nationale de Turquie, Constantinople, SOth December 1910. (Extract.) I saw the Grand Vizier yesterday, and I enclose a memorandum of our conversation. Hakki Pasha, in the course of our conversation, dwelt a good deal on the Baghdad question and on the situation in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. He stated distinctly that he thought the railway on its present footing must be made as far as Baghdad. This is significant in connection with the reports which are current, that negotiations have been begun for the early construction of the line between Helif and Baghdad, and also in connection with the para graphs in Djavid Bey's budget statement, in which he refers to the Baghdad question, and points out that in five years' time, the earliest date at which the line could be completed, the surplus of the debt revenues will probably have increased sufficiently to provide the guarantee as far as Baghdad, and that the Germans, therefore, will lose nothing by abandoning their lien upon the proceeds of the increased customs duties. The Grand Vizier also stated distinctly that it would be necessary to arrive at some arrangement satisfactory to England about the section between Baghdad and the Gulf, and expressed his readiness to bring pressure to bear on the Germans, if necessary, in this direction. I do not know whether the general political situation as regards Germany makes it any more likely now that they would be prepared to come to terms; but it is evident, in the first place, that we have no means of preventing the German line from reaching Baghdad, and, in the second place, that friction is likely to become more and more acute unless some settlement is reached. Such a settlement would, in itself, improve our relations with the Turks also, and I confess I do not see why we should not at the same time give the Turks some satisfaction regarding Koweit, if we obtain binding engage ments regarding its alienation or use as a ' port de guerre.' I will not, however, write more on this subject, as I hope I may have the opportunity of seeing you shortly in London. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Interview with Hakki Pasha , Grand Vizier, on 29th December 1910. I informed Hakki Pasha that I was leaving for London in a few days, and that it would be necessary to arrive at a decision regarding the future of the National Bank. As he was aware, recent events had raised grave doubts as to whether the bank could with advantage continue its operations. The decision of this question would depend, in great measure, upon the prospect of obtaining active and practical support from the Government. The bank would never have been started unless the invitation of the Ottoman Government and the attitude of the British Government had given it expectation of support from both. Hakki Pasha said that in England there appeared to be a mistaken idea that, because a concession had been given for the Bagdad Bailway, the ground 1757 F. D.j - u a «/ • t-p -araw fr&gt; hp civpii affQiin, it woulu. vcl^ j existing con^on^Wit^.^ _ ^ ^ it was , and it could not bo Tnkld But the Turkish Empire was large, and there was room lor v eiy many other enterprises which were open not only to German capital, but to British capital; and British capital would be heartily welcomed. T said that I did not think that this erroneous view was held by anyone who was well informed. It was undoubtedly true that the Baghdad question had St importance in the relations between England, Turkey and Germany' both in itself and also in relation to the position in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf generally. If the Baghdad question could he settled m a satisfactory manner, I was convinced that it would have an admirable effect on tlie relations of the three countries. Hakki Pasha said that the question of Koweit was at the root of the Turkish feeling about British action in that part of the worJd. On this subject he spoke strongly. He said that he regarded it as beyond doubt that British action in relation to Koweit had been unjust. Lnder British protection, although there was not a protectorate in the technical sense of the word, Koweit was the centre of the contraband arms traffic, and a source of continual conflict with its neighbours. So long as this anomalous state of affairs existed, it was impossible to restore peace and order in thai part ol the world. Koweit was like a thorn stuck in the side of Turkey ; and it^ was British action there more than anywhere else that had created suspicions oj British aims in Mesopotamia. T said that I was not acquainted with the details of the question, but whatever the rights or wrongs of the matter, His Highness knew perfectly well that British action regarding Koweit was not directed against Turkey, but against the possibility of Koweit falling into other hands. The Grand Vizier said that he quite realised this, but that practically the action taken by way of defence against another Power operated as against Turkey, ft was not in any way Turkey's interest or desire to permit any other Power to establish itself there. Even under the old regime, Abdul Hamid had not permitted the Germans to acquire a coaling station in the Red Sea. The new regime would be even more strongly opposed to any such acquisition. If there were any doubt as to this, Turkey would be willing to take formal engagements as to the use of Koweit as a naval station. He said that, in his opinion, the matter was one that ought to be capable of settlement if there was good-will on both sides ; but he complained that he had been unable to obtain a frank and full discus sion of the question, which was the first condition of an understanding. i said that the matter was not one in which i was entitled to express an opinion, but that i saw with great regret the extreme sensitiveness of Turkish opinion as regards the most innocent and legitimate activities of British shippmg and commerce in the Gulf. T referred to a recent article by Ismail Hakki Babanzade, in which the presence of British shipping at Bussorah and the extent of British trade there were treated as matters of offence and indications ol sinister intentions; whereas it was clearly essential to the prosperity of the country to welcome all the shipping and trade that could come, whatever the nationality. ^ Hakki Pasha replied that articles in the press must not be taken too Bussorah • and^ l Bj } ban 1 zad(S had i ust returned from Baghdad and was the question of KoweH n,0le ,m P reSsion on llim than anything else Ho th0n ret 'r ned 1 . t0 the q ues tion of the Baghdad Railway. tW -t Germans must be allowed to complete the line to Baghdad but a™.r f Tf 1Sed that Baghdad it was necessary to Ind some preferW he tou W To?^ tlSf T| En r and ' P™ 0 ! 86 soill tion was to be Clearly any arra^ement S he? H 'T d,foits ilC&lt; l ,,isan(l interests coneprnBrit r must he a matter for negotiation ; and it was for the be verj anxious t^Mrive'at 1 i proposals. The Turkish Government would i. e at a settlement, and would be prepared to brm^pressure on the Germans with this object. One solution would be to make the line south of Baghdad an international one; another solution would be that it should be a Turkish Government line, a suitable arrangement being made with the interests concerned for providing the capital. As regards the position of Turkey generally, he said emphatically that, in his view, it was most undesirable to give any one Power an exclusive or preponderant influence in Turkish affairs. He wished to remain on good terms with all the world; and the interests of Turkey lay in securing the assistance of all the Powers equally for her development. I then spoke again of the position of the bank. I said that so far the bank had received no practical evidence of the Government's desire to support it. No Government accounts had been given to us, and the only semi-official account we had was that of the Commission de la Elotte. The Constantinople loan had only been arranged after competition with other banks, and after a struggle lasting over several months. I asked whether he could give me any assurances of practical support in the future which I could lay before our friends in London. Hakki Pasha said that, as regards Government accounts, their hands were tied to a very considerable extent by the terms of the concession of the Ottoman Bank. The Constantinople municipal loan had produced profit sufficient to cover the expenses of the bank for one year at any rate. If the bank had been able to conclude the loan recently under discussion, the profits would have provided for the bank for two or three years at least. Unfortunately, this had been prevented by the action of the British Government, which, he said, speaking quite unofficially, he could only describe as a blunder. If the British Government did not interpose any bar in future the National Bank would be able to take part in Government loans, either in co-operation with the Ottoman Bank or in competition with it. Apart from that, he repeated that the whole of Turkey was open to foreign enterprise, and that'foreign capital would be welcomed. If British capital would come to take part in the development of the country, there would be a profitable field for the bank's energies. He regretted that British capital had taken so little interest in Turkey In recent years, and thought that both the press and commercial circles were not well-informed. He referred in this connection to the mining law, in the amendment of which the British Government had taken a great interest. The law had been amended, but in the two years which had elapsed since then there had not, so far as he was aware, been a single British application for a mining concession. I replied that British capital had had very good reasons for avoiding the country under the old regime; and in order to persuade it to come here now it was necessary to offer adequate inducements, and to create the conditions neces sary for success. In the case of mines, for instance, the absence oi roads and railways made all mines, except the richest, unremunerative. This accounted for the absence of applicants. As regards works of public utility we found, unfortunately, a certain want of practical sense in the Public T* orks Depart ment. With the object of securing advantages to the State concessions were hedged round with impossible conditions. It would be to the real interest of the 'Government to grant the first concessions on terms which would make them thoroughly remunerative; whereas the conditions now laid down were such that there could not be a large profit, and that there might very likely be no profit at all. ^ Hakki Pasha admitted that there was truth in what I said, but added that in his own opinion, this difficulty would disappear in time. At the outset of a parliamentarv regime, there was a tendency to criticise everything. In the endeavour to'avert such criticism, the conditions had perhaps been drawn too tightly. Experience would remedy these defects. I asked the Grand Vizier whether they proposed to approve the Baghdad municipal loan. He said that he had been somewhat disappointed as regards the administrative capacities of Nazim Pasha, and that they had doubted whether the money would be satisfactorily spent if it were granted. He thought however, that they would come to the decision to support Nazim Pasha still and in that case thev would approve the loan. I represented that4 it was very desirable to decide the matter as soon as ^Wc smw iny .URa ; &gt; Nazim Pasha, resuming our liberty of action m the mattf i. li..l &gt;•••'_ reached him, or would reach him in a day or two. I added tha, it lai^hl bav .. some influence as regard the future of the bank s if 1 could point to om mi _ , at any rate, though not a large one, which had been cone] aded. Hak Ki said that he would endeavour to hasten the decision. H. BABINGTON SMITH. 29 th December 1910.

J-5 that Malimoud Shevket Pasha and the senior officers by no means approye the direction given by it to Turkish policy. The lesson learnt by the refusal of the French Government to allow the late loan to be quoted in Paris has had its effect, and that there is a tendency in the committee to modify its chauvinism, at least, temporarily, is shown by the substitution in the secretaryship ot the moderate Haji Adil Bey, lately Vali of Adrianople, for the violent Dr. Nazim. Time will, therefore, to all appearances, bring about a change for the better in our favour, but on the other hand, the causes that are at work may operate slowly, and in the meanwhile articles such as those of Ismail Hakki—not to mention hints which have already appeared in the local press that English intrigues are responsible for the troubles in Kerek—may do us some harm, even in the eyes of those sections of the people who have now no doubts as to the sincerity of our friendship. Another danger from delay lies in the fact that the Turks desire th e Baghdad Hallway to be built. It is true that the financial arrangements hav e only been completed for the construction as far as El Helif, but, as the Grand Vizier implied to Sir Henry Babington Smith, there can be no question but that the money will be found for the annuities for the sections as Ear as Baghdad. There is even reason to believe that negotiations for the purpose are already on foot, and it is thus probable that although the line cannot actually be built for some years, the Germans may potentially reach Baghdad within a few^ months, and will be free to turn all their attention and influence to asserting their existing rights under the concession to the Baghdad Bussorah—- Gulf sections. It is not, perhaps, out of place to remark here that by her recent pourparlers with Germany Russia appears inclined to disinterest herself in the southern sections of the railway. In my despatch No, 42 of the 29th ultimo I expressed the opinion^ that too much importance need not be attached t o the advances made by llilaat Pasha to us for a renewal of negotiations lor a solution of the railway question, but it is quite possible that if that question and that of Koweit v eie treated together we should find a genuine and effective desire on the part of the Turks to come to an agreement. The prospect of gaining something at Koweit would be a powerful inducement to them to obtain from the Germans the latitude requisite for them to satisfy our requirements in the railway question. It shoulci be remembered that the main object in view when, eleven years ago, we entered into relations with Sheikh Mubarak was to prevent the Baghdad Hailw ay from reaching the shores of the Gulf except under conditions consonant v ith our interests, and I venture to suggest that it is worth while considering whether the moment is not now approaching when we should endeavour to turn our acquired position at Koweit to account, and whether, if we do not now seize the opportunity, we may not eventually find that we have saddled ourselves with responsibilities towards the Sheikh involving us is particularly thorny questions vis-a-vis of the Turks, without having reaped any commensurate advantage Our position as regards the actual terminus of the railway at Koweit may still be secure owing to the agreement of October 1907, but we might now use the leverage offered to us by the Turkish anxiety to settle the Koweit question to secure our interests on the Baghdad-Bussorah sections; whereas if we do not, and if we allow the line to reach Bussorah under purely German control, it appears to me that a very awkward situation might arise.

Such action might lead to a situation ot which the only solution would be a war with Turkey, and the question should be considered as to what should be done in such a case, and what complications in Egypt or India might be involved by war with Turkey In tact, Sir E. Grey considers that it would not be safe to press matters so far till the naval and military authorities are known to be agreed upon a plan of campaign, and prepared to carry it out in the last resort. For these reasons Sir E. Grey, though appreciating the inconvenience of the present unsettled and undefined state of affairs, considers that, unless extreme provocation is forthcoming, it would be better to wait till the Turkish Government renew this year their request for the increase of customs dues, and ihen to open the question oi all the points in dispute and to endeavour to secure a reasonable settlement.

Sik, , In my despatches ]N T os. 14 and 15 of the 4th January I had the honour to submit some remarks on Young Turkey's views as to the policy to be pursued in Southern Mesopotamia, and on the connection in the Turkish mind between the settlemenf of the Koweit question and the arrangements for completine- the terminal section of the Baghdad Railway. I notice by the Government of India's telegram of the 1st December, enclosed in the India Office's letter of the 9th December 1910, that the resident at Bushire advocates the necessity ' from the local standpoint 55 of publishing our agreement with Koweit and intimating to the Turkish Government our intention of making it effective, while also eliminating the anomaly of the Turkish flag there, inducing the Turks to confine themselves to Katif and Ojair, and bringing about their withdrawal from El Bida'a, Jinnah, IJmkasr, and P v - Batmjan. V l ] ^ ' : I would venture to submit that, for the reasons in part set forth in my despatch No. 14 of the 4th January, the time has not yet come for such a drastic treatment of our outstanding difficulties with the Turks at the head of the Persian Gulf. As pointed out in Sir Gerard Lowther's No. 603 of the 22nd August 1910, and in my No. 14 of the 14th instant, the Turks expect that in return for their making the arrangements we desire concerning the Baghdad- Persian Gulf section of the railway, we shall restore them to complete sovereignty over Koweit. They attach immense importance to the latter. , 1 cli on Id it ever be deemed expedient to accede 10 tho Turkivh (lesire point, and, should it e\ er oe ut 1 denondent on their resigning alJ the matter, ^u^f-east of Ojair. The other claims to Bahrem, El ^ ^ 4f Comet ' an d the Sepoy guard at the assets we possess or ^ ^ | cr as Turkish constitutionalism is a mere St r^fiSutions and is associated mainly with the state of siege ami seCTe ^court-mai'tiats, any settlement on the above lines, imply mg as it tould the delivery of Koweit to the tender mercies of committee regime, would seem to be excluded. 1 , • 1 Should the committee eventually prove unable to establish an orderly Government and the Empire be brought to a state ot anarchy, as in lersia, it might become necessary to consider the expediency 01 openly p-'A • iimmg a protectorate over Koweit and its dependencies, but in the meantime any whisper of our intention to adopt such a course would r(ii&gt;i a fi' •&lt;&lt; st&lt;-un both here and in Central Europe. The recent report in the ' Daily Telegrapli,' which reached here through the 'Neue Ereie Presse 'to the effect that England was about to conclude an arrangement with Germany that the Baghdad Railway should terminate at an 'English port in the (ruM, i.e., Koweit, called forth very angry remarks in the ' Tanin.' The writer concludes his comments by stating that it is imperative to warn those who are working to establish foreign influence in Mesopotamia, ' the oldest and most attached province of the Empire,' that their schemes are vain and that ' the mention of an English port in the Persian Gulf, to be established to the detriment of Ottoman interests and territorial integrity, is the height of indelicacy.'

Sir E. Grey would suggest that with a view to such a settlement (which would only be acceptable as part of an arrangement for British participation in the Baghdad Railway), His Majesty's Government might recognize the Turkish suzerainty while stipulating for a full measure of home-rule in the administrations especially as regards customs matters, as to which the Sheikh is particularly jealous of foreign interference. The question might also be considered whether provision be made for the payment of a fixed tribute by the Sheikh to Turkey, for which he might possibly recoup himself by certain port dues on trough traffic :—the continuance of the tribute to be subject to the equitable treatment of the Sheikh in regard to his date groves in the Vilayet of Bussorah. As the Sheikh has already virtually admitted Turkish suzerainty by accepting the title of Kaimakam, Sir E. Grey does not anticipate that there would be serious difficulties in inducing him to assent to such an arrangement, especially as he is most anxious that the terminus of the railway should be at Koweit. A settlement of the question under discussion would probably only be satisfactory if it involved the control of the port by His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh, thus excluding Turkish or German interference at Koweit in internal matters. It is not possible to estimate what leverage, if any, the situation of Koweit gives Great Britain on the Baghdad Bailway question until it is decided whether some such concessions as are above indicated can safely be made, but the main lever for the settlement of these questions will consist in the power of His Majesty,® Government to refuse their consent to the proposed increase of 4 per cent, in the Turkish Customs and to the continuation of the 3 per cent- increase beyond the month of April 1914i when the consent already given to that increase will expire.

Ends, A change of policy is involved by the proposals of His Majesty's Govern ment, and I . earnestly recommend that there should be no surrender of our position until (1) we secure predominant control in Baghdad-Koweit section of railway, say HO per cent, of capital and control as minimum, and (2) share with the Sheikh the absolute control of Koweit harbour and port ashore and afloat. 1 would further urge as a sine qua non that before concluding suzerainty negotiations a specific assurance be secured that terminus shall be at Koweit. If these essential conditions can be secured, I generally support Cox's views. It would be better that there should be no question of payment of tribute: an arrangement under which the Sheikh and the Turks divide the Koweit customs receipts to compensate latter for losses or reveuue at Basrah, would seem all that is required.

CONFIDENTIAL biKj I have the honour to enclose translation of an article in the Tanin by Ismail Hakki I&gt;ey, commenting on two recent articles in the Times concerning the Persian Gulf. He takes the Times to task, and perhaps with some reason, for dis cussing matters concerning railways in Turkey without mentioning the Ottoman Government. As regards England's ' interference ' in Mesopotamia, he would ask His Majesty's Government to declare that' England harbours no hostile thoughts with regard to Irak (Lower Mesopotamia), Bussorah, or any other place proved to be actually, morally, and historically part of Ottoman territory to-day, and that she has no designs of direct or indirect encroachment,' Ismail Hakki, while thus begging the question, calls this method one o f '■ very simple logic. 5 ' It is a common trait in Turkish character to charge one's opponent with some misdeed which is the creature solely one's own imagination, and call on the adversary to disclaim it. The Tanin was lately most anxious to have a denial from the Eussian Embassy of a statement that the Eussian Minister of the Interior had ordered the Czar's portrait to be hung in all mosques in Eussia. Ismail Hakki would similarly like us to deny that we have any intention of seizing Bussorah« His history is somewhat at fault when he imagines that England's appear ance in the Gulf dates from the suppression of the Indian mutiny, while the impossibility of negotiating with such a claimant is shown by his statement that ' if there is any country that has a historical, moral, and real right to the Gulf it is Turkey.' As set forth in my despatch No. 603 of the 29th August 1910, he would base a Turkish claim to Bahrein, Katr, the Trucial Coast, Muscat, and probably Gwadur, on the fact that an Ottoman Admiral sailed up the Persian Gulf in the first half of the sixteenth century. It would indeed be difficult to arrive at a comprehensive settlement of outstanding difficulties with a Young Turkey ' statesman,' who professes to believe, and proclaims that ' all the tribes (in Mesopotamia) are armed with hundreds of thousands of rifles coming from English factories,' while one cannot help wondering what methods the Young Turk Committee, which during the last twenty months has been unable to rule Constantinople without martial law 3 would apply to the Sheikh of Koweit, and others whose allegiance they claim in those parts. I have also the honour to enclose translation of an article in to-day's Tanin, from the pen of Hussein Djahid Bey, on ' Turkey and England,' commenting on the third leader in the Times. It is written on the whole in a moderate strain. When he talks of Germany winning a position of friend ship in Turkey by coming to the help of the latter, ' when none of her friends, not even England, stretched out a hand,' he is obviously referring to the recent loan negotiations. In this connection, a devoted adherent of the committee recently expressed his opinion, confidentially, that France and England had rendered Turkey an inestimable service in the matter of the loan by checking reckless military expenditure. Hussein Djahid's reference to martial law in Young Turkey and the 'stern measures' to which she has recourse shows that he fails to understand that Young Turkey is still in an 3029 F. D.i i =fotp and until she can return to a le^al and normal state it would ? r2ti to'hTnd over Sheikh Mubarak to her with the risk of his being be I ,!tiallnfl and hanged. He seems to forget that Ismaal Hakki Bey com- -in • the Timin the dispatch of an Ottoman torce to oa^SStVi-*. ■&gt;&lt; s—'' •• M - I have, etc., GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Extract from the Tanin of 23rd January 1911. (Translation.) The Persian Gulf. The day before yesterday Rifaat Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke some reassuring words about the Persian Gulf, which we think it not without interest to reproduce here :— ' As to rumours in the press concerning the Persian Gulf there ought to be no doubt as to the protection and safeguarding of our rights over ^ the Gulf, owing to the maintenance of the most cordial and friendly relations between us and the English Government. If there remain certain questions to be settled they will be solved not by newspaper articles, but by discussion between the two Governments on a basis of mutual good-will.' The Times has written two articles this week on the Persian Gulf . The first was indirectly answered by M. Pichon's statement—a statement confirmed yesterday by Rifaat Pasha-—that only the Ottoman Government can command the Railways in Turkey, and that the right to grant railway concessions belongs to Turkey alone. The statement of Rifaat Pasha quoted above is a reprimand to the Times for its article; it shows that the out rageous demands made by the Times are at variance with the ' mutual good-will between the two Governments.' Our own point of view and that of the Times differ on very many points concerning the Persian Gulf. I note that the articles I wrote from Bussorali about the political situation in that place have been misunderstood— perhaps intentionally, and that their importance has been so exaggerated as to open the door to a baseless misunderstanding. What I wanted to show in my letters, which portrayed a foreign influence increasing day by day until it has become a cause of uneasiness to Ottoman interests, was that an officious spirit is being shown not by the English Government, but by its officials in the ^ersian Gulf. To regard this as an attack on the English Government shows mat tnere exists a defence against this imaginary attack, or rather an attack un er the name of a defence. The aim, however, was not to make an cSZlklaL a foH England d ! rect &gt; : we 0 % pointed out the necessity for consolidating Ottoman power m those parts, it is always within our rights tostme to consolidate and strengthen our country, and this ou^ht to be considered as a proof not of hostility, but of friendship • for the stronger Hi '7'' pi '5'3 om w ' n i»iiot trir.u! s' 'jsgj 'j a- * rs:.' to I d ou/Mesopotamian luflll ? nce and oth er interference referred case sincerity and correctness ^vo 1 exis ^ or do no ^ exist; in the former then to prevent iheir oecurrpn op 118 prove their existence and Government ought to sive a ol^n ^ i cominuance » i 11 the latter the English i^as no hostile thoughts with regard'to iTk E ^ land3 place proved to be actually, morally, and historically part of Ottoman territory to-day, and that she has no aims at direct or indirect encroachment. If that is done we will take back our letters with shame, and we shall be the first to applaud the English Government's friendly declarations. I'V e are nure that this very simple logic will be well received by English statesmen, and we think the time has come to put an end to the disturbed and vague position in the Persian Gulf, and for the two sides to stretch out to each other a hand of sincerity free from all fraud and deception; for it must be admitted that no important cause of separation between England and Turkey will remain when once the Bussorah nightmare has been laid aside. To come to an understanding would dry up gossip at the source. If action is based on equity we can see no real reason why an understanding should not be come to ; only it is necessary that Turkey should not be treated as Central African chiefs or sheikhs on the shores of Hadramaut and Muscat, and therefore that in the negotiations our treaty, historical, and moral rights should be respected. If this is not done the Persian Gulf will become not a cross-roads—-a battle-ground for the interests of the whole of Europe—but a blind alley. To turn this into a cross-roads, to make it a high-road, depends on England's sincerity, and on whether she will pursue a policy which will give us no cause to hesitate. As Rifaat Pasha's statement shows that this is the case we can afford to wait, as it proves that England is ready to put an end in all sincerity to the reign of jealousy and hesitation. All politics of our time turn on the pivot of ententes, which are formed by countries as obstacles to the outbreak of wars. Alliances do not meet the need as it is impossible for two countries to have common interests on all questions. Eor a country like Turkey, for instance, which has different interests in each province and has to follow a different aim in every part the time has long come to adopt a method of treatment to each part and province. That is why we do not shrink from discussion with England, but on the contrary, support discussion within the bounds of reason. We say ' within the bounds of reason,' because the Times article we published cannot of course form a basis of agreement. Eor instance, the Times says, ' up to the present both Turkey and Persia have neglected their duty as possessors of the shores of the Persian Gulf, Eor 100 years that duty has been discharged by England.' Now it is not 100 years since the English flag was seen in the Persian Gulf, As a matter of fact, it is half-a- century since the East India Company passed through the danger of decline and death not only in the Persian Gulf, but even in India. What we mean is that when England has not possessed a real sovereignty even in India for half-a-century it is a contradiction of historical facts for the Times to consi der England as possessor and ruler of the Persian Gulf for the past 100 years. There is no country whose actual sovereignty in the Persian Gulf has lasted longer than that of Turkey, whose flag has waved in that sea since the time of Sultan Suleiman the Lawgiver. It may be that the Ottoman Government's power in those parts has been weakened now and then, but if there is any country which has a historical, moral, and real right to the Gulf it is our own. The Times say, i( It appears that Turkey thinks it necessary and sufH- cient, in order to establish Ottoman sovereignty, to occupy the territories claimed by Ottoman troops.' No just person can deny that it is Turkey who has made the greatest military sacrifices on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and has poured out the blood of her soldiers for her sovereignty. England may have carried out a sort of sea-police duty and sacrificed a few men, but we want to weigh the Ottoman blood spilt up to the present moment against the English blood ; if the English can prove that they have spilt one-tenth as much blood as we have we will give up our claim. Moreover, how far has England penetrated from the coast ? How far does her actual sovereignty extend in places where ours does not ? Does she levy taxes on the people, take men for military service, or form courts of justice in those parts ? What has been done in proof of soyereignty ? If a comparison' ' 11 ill 11 ulllllil i^ft^ 4 be made on these points the balance will, of course, be a hundred times more favourable to Turkey. . e , But Turkey has also moral rights, rights which it would be suicide for her to 'ire up. England is not in a position to invoke such a right. Ou the contrary, the feeling of the local population cannot be reconciled with the idea of English sovereignty. Yet the Times wants to arn re at a solution of the question by the legal method. The Sheikhs of Mohammorah and Koweit are supposed to he the allies of England. We do not know on what principle of international law such alliances are based. Neither of these sheikhs is indepen- dent; they have not even complete internal independence. How, then, can it be imagined that they possess independence in foreign affairs ? The Times claims that my letters were mistaken on two points. In the first place, it says that England has striven to prevent the smuggling of arms, and in that way has served Turkey. But I do not find this refutation very strong, for since all the tribes are armed with English weapons, the prevention cannot have been very effective. If anything is certain, it is that hundreds of thousands of rifles came from English factories a fact which is due to the doubtful position of Koweit. If the Sheikh of Koweit is indepen dent enough to form an alliance, he must have a responsible position, and in that case his land ought not to be an arms depot. No one ought to deny that if it serves as an arms depot, the countries that suffer have a right to dry up the source of the trouble. The other point on which the Times tries to refute me is this. It says I have claimed that the English have stirred up the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit, whereas the two sheikhs maintain that Turkey has stirred up the other sheikhs to make raids on them and plunder them. In the first place, I do not remember saying that the two sheikhs had been stirred up against us by England : on the contrary, T maintained that thev were abusing their doubtful political position. As to making raids and plun dering, what of the raids on Sa'adoun Pasha and the Muntefik tribes ? Those acquamted with Bedouin customs know that the Muntefik tribes will act, not as the result of Ottoman agitation, but by way of retaliation and for revenge. Knwrii !?n tl; \r,2 ,t0man | G(l i ernm - ent stirrin s up the tribes against those of Koweit and Mohammerah, there is no such thing. Even if there were—to oppose the impossible-how could it concern England?

As we did not clearly grasp her demands on the point, we were of the opinion that England ought to be asked what she wants in the Persian Gulf. We are glad to find that the Times article forms a reply to that question, for, as the Times says, the English ought to be as little doubtful of the friendly inten tions and cordial disposition of the Turks as the Turks should be that England will approach the question with a sentiment of friendship and justice. We were satisfied that explanations would be given in the Times which would lighten the darkness ; but unhappily we must admit that the lines we read did not come up to our expectations. In the Times article there is visible a state of nerves and trembling as astonishing as it is painful. We naturally cannot fail to notice the vehe ment attacks made on us by a paper which is assuring us that we shall always find friendly feelings in the English. If Russia enters into negotiations with Germany without notice to her friends, and if Germany wins' a position of friendship in Turkey in a very short time by coming to the help of the Turks at a moment when none of her friends, not even England, stretched out a hand, the fault is not ours, and we ought not to have the consequent annoyance visited on our heads. If there is a party which is responsible for English policy not taking its rightful active part in the affairs of the East, it is not Turkey. This being the case, it is not right to attribute the aloofness of England and Erance from Turkish policy and the resumption by Germany of her old friendship with Turkey to our ill-treatment of various Ottoman elements. That is a subterfuge, and an admission that they are not the friends of Turkey. If the Young Turkey Government finds it necessary to proclaim martial law in certain places and has recourse to stern measures, the reason and wisdom of the step is known to the whole world. In these first years the constitutional regime is bound not to wink at any aggressive action; that is necessary for the safeguard of its glory and honour. When we note that the leader of the Egyptian Nationalists, Mohammed Eerid Bey, has just been condemned to six months' imprisonment for writing a preface to a book, we cannot understand how Young Turkey, with its three-year-old constitution, can justly be blamed for not applying the laws of liberty and equality as fully as the English. Hence it is absolutely wrong to say that the Young Turks have resolved to follow a policy of force and severity, tyranny, and oppression, and that, having realised that they will therefore be debarred from friendship with Liberal Governments, they have inclined towards German policy. We cannot reconcile this view with the weight of such a paper as the Times. Perhaps speaking the truth openly like this arises from a fault similar to that lack of political ideas which the Times finds in us. If these are our only faults, we admit them. What does England want in the Persian Gulf ? It is not very easy to understand that clearly from the Times articles. That paper divides English interests in the Persian Gulf into two parts—economic and political. We think we can readily admit the economic interests, for what England wants is that her trade should not be prejudiced to the benefit of her rivals. As we have no intention of favouring one side more than another, it is unthinkable that a difference should arise on that point. But it is the question of political interests that is hard to understand. The attention :of the Times has been particularly struck by the articles of the Tanin, and our brother, Ismail Hakki Bey, about the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit. In this respect, it reminds us that the Sheikh of Mohammerah has no connection with the Ottoman Government. Turkey, however, never made such claim ; the Sheikh of Mohammerah is under Persia. But has that Sheikh any connection with England? At least he is our co religionist. Nevertheless, the Turkish Government claims no right over the Sheikh of Mohammerah ; but our right to desire to put a stop to the Sheikh's agitation and attacks in Ottoman territory will be generally admitted. Can the Constitutional Government wink at the presence in Bussorah itself of the secret paid agents of the Sheikh as the means of carrying out his various aims ?6 /Wm'ls as tlio most correct As to Tvoweit, we d' not wish to enfcv to t ,, e Ministry of method will be to leave the dwcusw® P il; ^ ottoman territory.

U I am oi' opinion that even if we cannot obtain a preponderant share in the financial and administrative control of the Gulf section, it would nevertheless be to our interests to come to a friendly understanding provided that we could thereby ensure the terminus of the line being at ivoweit, and control both ashore and afloat remaining entirely in our hands. At present nearly all the trade is British and therefore any increase in Customs is equivalent to a British contribution i I towards the cost of the line. StilljMby virtue of our position j in India,^we can-count on obtaining a predominant share in the supply of labour and material for the construction of the section, it would seem worth our while agreeing to the 4/^ increase in Customs on the understanding that it is only for a limited period, and in exchange for a permanent guarantee that British merchandise .'/ill never be subject to differential rates. The precise percentage of our share would not matter so long as we can protect ourselves against differential treatment even though a predominance in management and finance is unattainable But in any case we should surely have the strongest reasons for claiming a larger share tuan any other tower excopt Turkey. In this connection the inclusion of America might be - / '' r on the grounds that she ha© a considerable interest in the trade of the Gulf and Lie sopot ami a in the *vav ox 1 i q u o x ic--. , 9 dates and piece-goods. If this were i e .isible I would suggest a distribution of shares as followsi— iurlse^ 30, vji yat br itain ^5, Germany 18, France 15, America 12. In which case we could count on practical control as long as France and America &gt; r ere with us. OurOur standing out altogether would, in the event of the line being brought to Busreh, or some other point in Turkish limits in apite of us, involve a greater loss of prestige than if w© secured control of terminus without management and control of section, in this latter case our tailing a prominent part in the construction, as above suggested, would still further miti gate any loss of prestige we might incur owing to our not con trolling the section, I have not had Lord Lansdowne 1 s memorandum with me to refer nWiHWHimMIWiI * - ■ ir u muj i j- m i ■ -&gt;v■&lt;&gt;«?^ to; but it seems to me of vital importance for us to do our utmost to include Lira Kasr in any bargain which provided for our aontrol of 'Koweit and its t0rritories ,, . We have the strong est grounds for the support of such a contention as it is generally admitted that the existing fort was built by the present SheiKh's grandfather, and his tribe afterwards migrated to Koweit. Although the fact of the i^oweit terminus being in our hands would greatly diminish the importance of Warba dnd Bubian, still their inclusion would be advisable as precluding th© possibility of the Khor Abdullah in connection with a point in the Baghdad section within Turkish limits, being used by Turkey in the event of a with Persia and the closure of the Shat t —a3— Arab• The importance strategically of i^hor Abdullah would be still further reduced if the railway were to come direct to x^oweit without touching Um Jt^asr; but in any case it .would seem import ant to eliminate the Turks from the S.E. end of Bubian Island.

With reference to the Baghdad Railway, in recent years the circumstances have changed, and the entire political perspective is now dilferent. Some years ago Germany entered on that policy ot railway construction in Asia Minor which gradually resulted in every rail way in these portions of the Turkish Eupire, except one, passing into her hands. The present posit on dates from 190(5, when a convt'ntion was concluded between the Turkish Govern ment and the Anatolian Railway for an exten- sioti of the line from Konieh, in the heart of Asia Minor, to Baghdad and Basrah and a port on the Persian Gulf. It is quite clear that the Unionist Govern ment in 1903 took up no hostile attitude to wards the railway. They did not object to the construction of the line under certain con ditions, and it was only when those conditions were not satisfied that His Majesty's Govern ment receded, I believe with much regret, from the negotiations into which they had entered. Whether this was a fortunate or an unfortunate decision it is not necessary to discuss. In the circumstances it was inevitable, and, so far as I know, it was ratified, rot merely by public opinion, but by all who were competent to decide on both political sides. What is the present position? As regards rail way construction, the progress during the past few years has not been great. The line has been carried to a point where it has halted for six years. Money has been found, I believe, for tke extension. The most difficult section of railway now lies before its promoters. There is talk of reviving negotiations. During the last day or two 1 have seen a great deal in newspapers about fresh transactions which are alleged to have taken place in Constantinople, and under which the Baghdad railway is alleged to have surren dered its concession for the Gulf section under certain conditions in [return for the grant of a line from Osmanieh to the well-known port of Alexandretta. if this agreement is conclud - ed it 'would be a 'great ad van tape to {T Te German coTTi^ali\~ wTTTcTTwould gain access to the most important port on the Mediter ranean, and, so far as I can see, the whole tr.i do of Mesopotamia, which has a west - w ard trend, must ttnet its outlet in that port. Wnat more immediately concerns us if these statements be true, is that the price alleged to be paid for this very notable concession is the surrender of the rights of the company at the Gulf end of the former line, and if that be so the position would be very much easier should it be the desire of His Majesty's Govern ment to enter into discussions either with the Turkish Government or with anyone else upon that branch of the subject. B uitish I nterests. What are the British] interests in the Bagh dad Railway ? They are two-fold. In the first place, they are commercial and economic on every section of the railway from sea to sea, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf. Secondly they are political, strategic, and Imperial upon those sections of the railway in the neighbour hood of the Gulf. Over almost all the area covered by the Baghdad railway, British trade is predominant. We have to see, therefore, that in these arrangements our trade should not be subject to any differential treatment in the future. Sir Edward Grey said the other day that the orignal convention contained satisfactory assurances on this point. I am not quite clear as to that myself. A mere clause in the statutes of the company prohibl t- imy (l inerentia'l rate s h'mv pf Ijttlp. hv itself . 'Jt woulcl be comparatively easy to THme a tariff favouring categories of goods coming mainly from Germany as opposed to goods coming mainly from Great Britain or India. Therefore, I am a bit suspicious, and I hope His Majesty's Government will be alive to this aspect of the case, and that consent for money required will not be given unless they are assured that our commercial interests will be protected over the whole of the area from hostile and differential treatment. There is one branch of the projected railway about which I am not altogether happy, and that is a branch just north of Baghdad to Khanikhan. British trade going up the Gulf in ships is sent to Baghdad in boats, and then by mules over the mountains into Persia. That British trade amounts to £1,000,000 a year. The whole of the trade of the other countries of|Europe on that route is not one tenth of the sum. What is to happen to that trade in the future ? U p to Baghdad it will hold its own , I think. Wliat will happen on tlie middle section between Baghdad and Khanikhan I am not quite certain, but I have a very shrewd sus picion that wh en the Russian railway is built f rom Teheran to the frontier the w hole o f f.TT^ tra.fip. of INorthern ana uentr al Perl iarin so far' as it'now 1 down Ho'the southern coast by the customary caravajj route, will be ^ diverted to this new line, and if that be so the prospect for British trade isone which we cannot help regarding 7 with some alarm. I hope the Government will keep an open eye on this branch of the que&amp;tioii, and will leave no opportunity of secpriiig-fair treatment which theenoimous p yej^ naterance of our commerce on the route entitles us to demand. Sir E. Grey said that if we wanted to combat this route with advantage British trade ought to make other routes, though he did not specify what they should be, and he rather blamed Mr. Balfour for not suggesting any alternatives. It is not for the Opposition to make suggestions in these cases. The respon sibility lies with His Majesty's Government, and it is for them to put pressure where it is likely to be successful. I should like to know whether Sir E. Grey's statement was merely a platonic enunciation of general principles, or whether it pointed to any definite plan in t he mind o f His kajesty 7 s Government ? Some years ago there was given to His Majes ty's Government an autograph promise from the then Shah of Persia that any Russian rail way concession in the North of Persia should be balanced by a corresponding British railway in the South. That promise has been quoted more than once. If it is true that a Russian railroad is about to be commenced in the North, the time is drawing near for the possible ful filment of this pledge to us. (Hear, hear.) Our interests in the Baghdad railway are political and strategical. These considerations start into being the moment we leave Baghdad. It is a mistake to suppose that our inter ests are confined to the Gulf. They extend over the whole region from the Persian Gulf to Baghdad. (Hear, hear.) The naviga tion of the Tigris right up to that city has been in the hands of a British company for scores of years, who, though crulley hampered in recent years, have managed to hold their own. We have treaties with Arab chieftains all along the banks of the river. Nearly 90 per cent of the trade going to Baghdad is British or Indian. Many Indian subjects visit and live at the Holy Shrines. Thesef facts entitle us to a predominant iniluence in any questions which may arise with reference to that end of the Baghdad rail way. (Hear, hear ) No R ivals in the G o.ls'. The Persian Gulf is part of the maritime frontier of India. With its politic? involved the peace and integrity of the Indian Empire. It is a fundamental prin ciple that we cannot allow any rivals in the Gulf. (Hear, hear.) The assertion of this principle is not, and need not be, antagonistic to any other power in that part of the world. I imagine that it will be frankly accepted by Germany. Whether we enter into negotiations with that Power, or as seems more likely, with Turkey, respecting the railway, I venture to say there is nothing in our claims which is likely to prevent a successful issue of those negotiations. Quite frankly , if I wer e to spea k as an Englishman alone, i should n ot b e verj a nxious to see T rie ua ghdad Railway carried _ down to the Gult. it would produce elements * of change and novelty, and possibly of danger, I am not clear that it would benefit our trade.

I doubt very much whether the Baghdad section can be financed by any Power alone if remunerative profits are to be secured. There are also great schemes afloat for the reclamation and irrigation ot Chaldea and Mesopotamia. Everyone would like to see those projects translated into fact, but those who have travelled there are inclined to wonder where, if those works are executed, the popula tion is to come from in order to till the reclaim ed ground and to revive the ancient glories of the past.

Whatever method of constructing may be favoured in the railway, I hope His Majesty's Government will see that the predominance of- British interests is maintained, and that no thing is done to impair or whittle away Bri tish rights. (Opposition cheers.) I shall be glad to know whether the Government have information to communicate on the sub ject of the alleged agreement between Russia and Germany, entered into, if not concluded , at Potsdam, in November last. Several versions of it have appeared in the newspapers. lam quite prepared to believe that they are ail in correct; but certain authoritative statenents have been made by the German Chancellor at Berlin and the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg. From these utter ances there is justification for the belief that when the German railway from Baghdad reaches the frontier of Persia the Russians are prepared to build a line from Teheran to taeet it.X i Vw' - V- T 1 Ul' !

When the Uevulu- tioh trausforined the political situation in Turkey, the young Turks counneuced their reign under the iiilluence of a convic tion that, ^ if Turlfey could hppe-to re • cjovei- a place aanpng the nations, there must he a complete break, witji Ilamidian ' ta-aditions. Those were briet' moments, full of hope and even of expectation ; and, difficult, of realisation as such ideajs no doiibi; we're, they Were not, and aye still not, impracticable. But these mdments Were certainly b^ief. They have been succeeded by a different temper^ both in the dorhain of .doipestic and foreign politics. (Jevhian counsels are- sixain s^preuie r in Cons tantinople, Wiiat rt'ould seem to be the guiding principles of Turkish policy at th^ present time ?

Turkey stands, of course'; in ' a wholly diliereht position; but the mental ten- idenby towards High Politics is seavcpliy iess dange'rous in her case than in the case of Persia. •As to the cOmihercial side of the qustion Mr. Lynch writes;-- Nobody would, 1 suppose, contend that a rail way of this kiii'l, iinanced almost entirely by the capital of Europe, and controlled- by Euroneans, was iv matter of purely domestic concern to Turkey. Bat the facts that it is soughtifco find fresh revenues for its construction in lhe shape of iurther increases of the Customs duties, and that these duties arc tlxed by international agreement, entitle other countries trading with Turkey to havo a voice in the future of the line Of these countries, Gireat Britain is the one whose trade is by far the largest, and which, therelore, stands to lose most by any re striction, .such as- increased duties, which may be placed upon tha.vohune of this, trade It is at this point that we : appro^h the com mercial question nnd it requires much more care ful attention than it has hitherto -received. What will be the commercial value of the rail way?. I agree with Jleri von G winner that the fear of an inlux of German goods into Asiatic Turkey and Pers a coming by railway across Europe, and favoured by diiferential rates during their passage through Anatolia, is a pure ligment of the imagination, Huch goods are conveyed at pr . sent by sea to Haidar Pa^ha, the terminus of the Anatolian, Uail way opposite ,0oiu tantinople. It is scarcely conceivable that the Baghd id railway wiU not be hnke I by a branch line with the sea at or in the neighbour hood of the port of Alex.au Ireita. Goo Is for the rail way from the great industrial .centres of Europe will th n be conveyed to sea 'ay Alexaa- dretta. The danger of dnfereutial treatment,, whether in rates or by other advantages, commences, therefore, at Alexandretta. 1 can- n ; t see how . this danger can effectively be ayerted unless Great Britain has at least an equal voice in the management of the- line with the representatives of Germany and Austria We must remember that from Baghdad a branch of ■the railway is -to be taken to the Persian froa? tier at Khaaakin in the direction of Ivirmanshah Now the Baghdad-Kirmanshah trade route i^ one that, has been .developed entirely by Eng lishmen, and over which British goods to the value of over a million sterling arc conveyed every,year. This hgure .compares \\ith under £1,00;),000 as t'he value of the goods sent by.all other European countries, including Germany. Should the rail,way be built, if did' rential rates were imposed, even . on the Baghdad- Khanakin section alone,, all this trade would eithev rind the door slammed in its face or would be placed at a disadvantage with Ger- maa trade. Commercially, this.seem* to. me a •much-.-fmore , important matter thai) the *oi:- il^^reafc^jrntam- j^ '.^hV' the railway between Baghdad W) i jna sugge._ section o and the Persian® &lt; It is, indeed difficult to perceive what pos sible object can be served, under existing economical coAjXftlFi^e frbin Baghdad to the Persian Gulf, ^e^tegicallyji;,. could be of little valug tQ.Turl^y.ias hentKoo^faiwould continue to be conveyed bv sleamer down the Tigris As a means €&gt;f» Shrough passenger or mail communication between India and the British Isles, it could scarcely compete with the existing route- mVi'-tflfti'^uezr Canal ■ As Sir Thomas Sutherland has pointed ouL it would only hefed a 'slfghii ''acceleration of 'the'' present steamer service .toy-establiisk., equal conditions with the proposed railway in point of view of time. As regards comfort, the advantages jare all in favourof the spa route, in spite of the assurance given us by Herr von JGwinner that the railway journey is cspable of being made quite comfortable, by placing a German ice machine in every ear*, and' a little liquid air. As for goods; the^cost of transport would be immeasurably; heightened if we add, as we mustrto the freight the additional e.ost of the article to the consumer due to the' increase 1 'of (Justpiius duties, tor the purpose of firraisieiug the line. Let me give an illustration. A to.ni of cotton ^ goods is worth, on the average, £100. I he duties are levied ad valorem and the suggested increase of 4 per cent, i would therefore work out at 80s. per. ton. The pre sent river freight on such goods from 3 us rah, near 'the head of the Persian Ghlf, to Baghdad is ''Jos: a ton. Even if the raihv'ay were ' : tb carry therp for nothing, there would, therefore; beanincrpase i-a their cost to-the consumer ia Baghdad of 55s. a ton ! V If wb examine the commercial aspect of the railway from 1 the point of vi4w of Turkey,-' 1 think we must come to the conclusion that little thought has been bestowed upon it;' It is possible, but, not ■.certain.; jthat the districts about Mosul inay benefit by the railway;in their export trade.* But the natural outlet 4pr the. districts about the Euphrates and the Tigris are those waterways themselves. But ai'e 1 ' c'apable of almost indefinite im- provemeat;- k-nd -that at J a' cost which sinks into dnsigoificance when compared with the railway. 'The pvp^eflt average cost of river transport i between Baghdad and Biisi;ahis 12&lt;j. a ton on | ordinary goods, and 10^ a ton or less on grain. : Only a rail way heavily subsidised at the 'cost of the taxpayer could compete with rates such as these. It is true that there might be some ad vantage'in the rates of freight from Alexan- dretta to the European ports as compared with those ruling at Busrah. . Taking the United 'Kingdom, and assuaiiag that the. sea freight from AlexaadrettirT\'Oiild be th-e sambas the average present rate at Constantinople, we get a rate of 17s. 6/. a ton. This compares with the 'averageayxisting rate Ijet^vedh Busfali aadt^xe 1 United itingdon^ of a A t'oil. Tlj^ atlyj^t^e in favour of Alexandretta is, of course, ac counted for to some .ftxbMit by the fact that cargo consigned from tiiat pgrjf^would escape the Sue^ Qanal dues, which are equivalent, for the purpose of this calculation, to about 5s. a ton. But this is a't/fvlal mSstter wlierf'compared to the proposed^ increase in the t Customs duties i and if trapl were ...increased?' by the,, aeverop'mciff; *of the great waterways, the ocean rate between Busrah and the United Kingdom would tend to approximate to the Bombay rate, which is normally about-JO.s. a ton. The conelusion is that there would be very UtSle saved in cost of transport ftom Alexandretta as -compared with transoort from the oorts at the head of the Persian Gulf. i hesc facts, which, at the risk of becoming tedious, I have thought it necessary to brin' - Oil'. make it plain thatfurthercareful considera tion is necessary if the Baghdad scheme is to be 1 brought into consonance with the requirements [ of Turkey and with the interest-? of her follows | among the nations,'. Whether it is destined to be so treated is quite another matter. Its promoters are quite entitled to raise the note of tjriumph which is'characteristic of their recent writings. Indeed, their course has, up to now, been marked by a series of diplomatic Successes. They have already obtained -an equivalent lor that increase in the Customs duties which was necessary to finance the Taurus sections* of-tlfcih project. The duties were raised with the consen-t ,of the Western Powers, on the ground,, that an exhausted Treasury could not otherwise supply the funds required tor the.administration of Ivlacedonia. • A- short time differ wards, a sum of several hundred thousand pounds' a? year was made availablejlaiiviidfi-om the - ^HHi-dest—revenues in Turkey, and was earmarked for the- railway r' But : the Mncedohfah ■ transaction lias still some rough-adges abo-nt 4t-, -ftftd- dHHcult to believe that an enterprise of this nature can be carried thpoug^ by sheet- forcq.

GERMANrS ATTITUi E. &gt; Two v?ry important commimicationi defining the .attitude of the German Government to wards the Baghdad Railway question appeared in German newspapers on the 5th March One of them, which appeared in the official Nordrlfiutsc/ie Ally-mcine Zcitu»g, and the sub stance of which has already been given, pointed out that the construction of the line as far as Baghdad had already been definitely settled between the Turkish Government and the German company which was building the railway, so that no negotiations between the Ottoman Empire and any other Power could possibly deal with this part of the scheme. Concerning the final section from Baghdad to the coast of the Persian Gulf the official com munication emphasised the fact that the con cession for the construction of this part of the line had also been granted to the German com pany, so that certain rights had been granted to this corporation by formal agreement. All reports of negotiations between Turkey and Great Britain were thus obviously beside the mark because England could not discuss with Turkey alone the question in which Germany has certain conceded rights, just as it would be improper for Germany to^ discuss with England the matter of a railway which runs exclusively through Turkish territory. If Great firitaiu had any wishes in regard to the final section of the line, the British Government must formulate them and communicate them both to Turkey and Germany. So far as Germany was concerned, said the communication, England's wishes would be considered in a friendly spirit. A ottatiox tn E n or. an t&gt; This official statement was supplemented by the following despatch, sent to the J'rnnkfwter Zeitung by its Berlin correspondent, whom the Standard'i Berlin correspondent describes as ' one of the chosen mouth pieces of fch? German Foreign Office':— *' English newspapers continue to show agita tion concfruing the question of the Baghdad Railway-in Germany. Long ago we became accustomed to treat questions connected with the Baghdad Railway as a business matter, while in England they cannot divest the matter of all the political significance which has been artiflcally attributed to it. Even the House of Commons cannot refrain from occupying itself with the nutter by addressing all sorts of indiscreet questions to Sir Edward Grey. ^ In all these discussions a large section of the British Press has been unable to see the Tights of the question clearly, for .British rule in India, British supremacy in the Persian Gulf, and the alleged British Protectorate over Koweit serve as reasons for advancing claims on territory which is beyond all doubt the pos session of Turkey.

In the course of the debate on the budget in the Turkish Chamber on the 5th March the Grand Vizier made.an impertant statement with regard to the scheme. Ismail Kemal, the leader of the Democrats, criticized the system of kilometric guarautees for railways, and the Baghdad Railway, remind ing the Ohamber of the offers of the British and French groups to build certain lines with out a guarantee, which were rejected by the ex-Sultan Abdul flam id. The Grand Vizier pointed out that the present Government was not responsible for past concessions, but was detei mined scrupulously to observe the engagements contracted. He defended the system of guarantees, declaring that the Government had suffered no loss on this head, while cue receipts from provincial taxation had inc.reased 45 per cent., thanks to improved communica tions, since the reign of the Sultan Abdul Aziz. The continuation of the Baghdad line was a settled matter. Although any increase in the Customs was pledged, the railway company had renounced its rights to the recent Customs surtax of 3 per cent., in order to permit the application of the money to reforms in Mace donia. A similar question had arisen to-day in regard to the 4 per cent, increase in the Cus toms. However, the Government would never renounce the prolongation of the line. It was impossible that it should remain at VA Helif, the junction of Baghdad and Con stantinople being a primary nece* si v. With the completion of the sections t) KI tie!if there would remain 600 kilometres only as far as Baghdad, which would cost £;T;!i).&gt;,000 annually—a trifle compared with the results he would hope and strive ! o attain. Personally he was irrevocably determined not to recoil', and was confident of the supporCof the Chamber. In regard to the sections beyond Baghdad, an understanding was inevitable owing to the loyalty and goodwill of the Government whose only interests were Ottoman iuterests. When the line reached Baghdad, if an understanding had not been arrived at, the Chamber would hare a right to criticize the Government.THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY.. GERMANY'S ATTITUDE.

Prudent English newspapers refrain from explaining on what rights such a demand is 'based, and the reasons given by the less prudent section of the British Press cannot possible be taken seriously. No one will desire to prevent Great Britain | from assuring her rule over India, but if British interests in India are to servo as claims on railways and ports in Mesopotamia, then Eng land might, with equal justice, claim supremacy over South Italy, for the distance of Koweit frum the nearest point of the Indian frontier is almost exactly as far as Portsmouth is from Naples. Concerning the British .claim to the protectorate of Koweit. the Turks are known to take a different view from that of the English, and we have no reason to regard the Turkish attitude towards this matter as less justified than the British attitude, _ But, apart from Koweit even a protectorate in one form or another over this port would not justi fy the putting forward of any claim whatever by Great Britain to control the final section of the Baghdad Railway,for with equal right the possession of Gibraltar might be made the basis ,,of a claim to control the eptire, railway system of Spain. ~ ^ , • / (5*5 ' R easonabt.e V oices. .u ' We note with satisfaction fhat r'easonameCj voices are already 'being raised on this point in'^ England, for one English paper recently ex plained very clearly that Turkey can construct on her own territory whatever railways she pleases or entrust their construction and man agement to whatever companies she may choose for this purpose, The ©nly contracting parties in the matter of the Baghdad railway are the Turkish Government and the' Baghdad Railway Company, which is under German management.

In the course of the debate on the budget in the Turkish Chamber on the 5th March the Grand Vizier made.an impevtant statement with regard to the scheme, Ismail Kemal, the leader of the Democrats, criticized the system of kilometric guarantees for railways, and the Baghdad Railway, remind ing the Chamber of the offers of the British and French groups to build certain lines with out a guarantee, which were rejected by the ex-Sultan Abdul Hamid, The Grand Vizier pointed out that the present Government was not responsible for past concessions, but was determined scrupulously to observe the eiagagements contracted. lie defended the system of guarantees, declaring that the Government had suffered no loss on this head, while the receipts from provincial taxation had increased 45 per c^nt., thanks to improved communica tions, since the reign of the Sultan Abdul Aziz. The continuation 'of the Baghdad line was a settled matter. Although any increase in the Customs was pledged, the railway company had renounced its rights to the recent Customs surtax of 3 per cent., in order to permit the application of the money to reforms in Mace donia. A similar question had arisen to-day in regard to the 4 per cent, increase in the Cus toms. However, the Government would never renounce the prolongation of the lino. It was impossible that it should remain at El Ilelif, the junction of Baghdad and Con stantinople being a primary nece 1 ei y. With the completion of the sections t; El Ilelif there would remain 600 kilometres only as far as Baghdad, which would cost £ r L&gt;Or),000 annually—a trifle compared with the-results he would hope and strive ! o attain. Personally he was irrevocably determined not to recoil, and was confident of the support^of the Chamber, in regard to the sections beyond Baghdad, an understanding was inevitable owing to the loyalty and goodwill of, the Government whose only interests were Ottoman interests. When the line reached Baghdad, if an understanding had not been arrived at, the Chamber would have a right to criticize the Government.R, l I c ; r it m0,nber Perc3r cri fcicising the \ n -&gt;in ij- issian agreement from the noinT r * * British cormner e.

In his reply, Sir Edward Grey said that he complaint to make of Mr Balfour's remarks, but the Leader of the Opposition had not shown what lever Britain possessed by which she might exert an influence on the course of events in the middle East. Mr. Balfour admitted that an opportunity arose when he was in office of taking part in the Baghdad Railway st he me, but that it was not been found practi cable to secure equal rights with regard to plan, ft that opportunity passed (continued Sir Edwaid) surely it was not easy for us to create that opportunity again, or to take advantage of it (Oheers.) T should like the right hon. gentfemm to be quite clear about this. I am not reflecting upon anything that he did while he was in office. I do not say it was an opportunity of which more could have been made than hi- Government made of it. I only want to em phasise this point-that the Baghdad liailwav concession having come into existence—I think while they were in office-they did not find it practicable, though they were quite as con scious of British interests as they are now. to arrange British participation in the enterprise. So it was not likely, when the Baghdad Railway had made some further pro gress, that we should find it easier than they did. In all the comment of the right hon. gentleman there was nothing to show that we h d even been m a more favourable position than his own Government was for arran^inf terms with regard to British interests in 'the Baghdad Railway.

The con cession has not been extended, and it is within the rights of the German concessionaires and the Turkish Government to carry out its terms as they please, in Turkish territory. The branch which was to be made from Baghdad to Khanikin was contained in the original concession. Ihe right hon, gentleman says ' Yes ; but now you go beyond Turkish territory there is going to be a branch made from Khanikin to Teheran, and that is not going to be under British control. Whether there had been the Anglo-Russian 'agreement or not, anyone who looks at the map and sees Liiat the branch from Khanikin to Teheran is going to proceed not south but north, into Persian territory, will know that in no conditions in recent years would it have been possible for us to secure concessions for railways in the north of Persia. It we are to have concessions for railways they must be in the South. Northern Persia is out of our reach. Wo could not have secured the concession, and, if we had, we could not have protected it. If we were to protect British interests thfy must be protect ed in the south and not in the north of Persia, and that remains unaffected by anything we have*done since we came into otiice. So far as British trade can be protected by guaranteeing equal rights on these railways, it will be protect ed. (Ministerial cheers) More than that we cannot do with regard to these railways The right hon. gentleman said that t ho.-e guarantees of equal rights may ! be so ordered as to be in practice unfavourable to British trade. Our only guarantee against that is to obtain concessions and make other routes of our own for British trade. You cannot possibly take away the concessions which the Germans have got. The right lion, gentleman suggested no lever which we could use to bring pressure to bear in the interests of British trade on these railways But we aro not quite so helpless in the matter as might be supposed from the speech of the right hon gentleman. T hk M onky Q ukstion. These railways are going to cost money. The Turkish Government require money, and have applied for a 4 per cent increase in the Customs duty, which cannot be levied without our con sent. I am exceedingly anxious that we should give our consent. I wish to see the new reyijns in Turkey strengthened. (Cheers.) I wish to see them supplied with resources which wiil enable them to establisli strong and just government in all parts of the Turkish Empire. But if any part of this money is to be used to promote a railway which must be a source of doubtful advantage to British trade, or, still more if the money is to be used to make a railway which will take the place of means of communication which have been so far in the hands of British concessionnaires. then it will be impossible for us to agree to the 4 per cent increase until we are satisfied that British trade interests will be satisfactory safeguarded, (Cheers.) As regards Koweifc, we are not anxious to have a forward policy in the Persian Gulf, or to acquire new territory, or disturb the statm (/ mo ; but if the status quo is going to be dis turbed by others, then undoubtedly we must use our resources to maintain the position which we have in the Persian Gulf. (Cheers.) Part of the statu* quo is that we have entered into treaty obligations with the Sheik of Koweib and it is incumbent upon us to see that these obligations towards to Sheik o r Koweit in. maintaining his position are fulfilled.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 13.) (No. 81.) gi r Per a, February 5, 1911. THE 'Times' of the 28th ultimo printed an article entitled 'Turkey and Koweit' from a correspondent, the object of which appeared to be to prove that the Sheikh of Koweit was an independent ruler, and that the suzerainty of Turkey did not extend to Koweit, and that Great Britain possessed a preferential position there. Whether the publication of this article at this moment, when the deepest suspicions as to our action in the Persian Gulf have been aroused, was judicious is questionable, but in any case the arguments brought forward in the article do not appeal to e very convincing, and it has elicited a long reply from the pen of Hussein Djahid, a translation of which I have the honour to enclose. _ i t w &lt; &gt; i The article is moderate in tone, and the writer appeals to Lord Ouizons * ' Persia and the Persian Gulf/' for evidence in support of his contentions, althoi^h m one portion of the article he contests our rights to use the evidence of British othciais in support of our claims, while he himself quotes the work of the son of Midat 1 asha in support of the Turkish view. He cites various passages from the pen of Lord Ourzon, which appear from reference to the work to be accurately given, ana which are in suppoit o ui s claim from Uiair to Fao. i i i \ x 4.1 The writer briefly states the nature of the arrangements concluded between .he old regime in Turkey and the British Government, and concludes by deprecating a continuance of the status quo, and expresses a hope for the definite settlement of the Koweit question by friendly and benevolent discussion. • , • j i- The general impression here seems to be that the ' Times article instead of strenertheninef our case rather reveals some of its weak points. 6 &amp; I have, &amp;c.

Extract from the ' Tanin' of February 3, 191L K oweit, BABANZADE ISMAIL HAKKI'S reference to Koweit as a kaimakamhk (Turkish canton), and our statement that in Ottoman eyes Koweit is Ottoman territory, have called forth a long article in the ' Times' of the 28th Janu ^T' 0 It will be seen that the object of that article is to prove that even Ottoman suzerain rights over Koweit, not to speak of the rights of sovereignty aredo^bttiU As we said before, it is natural for the Ottoman Government to admit that England has certain rights in the Persian Gulf; but it is clear that iur c\ cou u never conse to have indisputable Ottoman rights and interests trampled under 00 . m pmoirs The Ottoman rights over Koweit belong to this order. Mid a i i i v clearly show that during his governor-generalship of Ba 1 ^ ad \ m ^ connected with the Ottoman Government as a kaimakamhk with ce ^ t ^ m P r ^ vl ^ and exemptions. Moreover, whereas, until then, Kuweit beamed a i- i i foreign flags, they adopted the Ottoman flag ; and the fact that they av , . it ever siSce and that Sheikh Mubarak is called to-day a ' pasha, a title belonging exclusively to Turkey, is the most decisive evidence that the Ottoman sovereignty has continued without interruption. The acquisition by Koweit o cei am prm eges^ exemptions is no proof that Ottoman sovereignty over Koweit evei apse ' . . Koweit out of the question, there are places in all parts of the oman [1894 n—2]2 which have become more or less privileged; and their exceptional position has never meant the lapse of Ottoman sovereign rights. i t i * v n In examining the nature of th&lt; relation between Koweit and the Turkish Govern ment the 'Times' quotes the evidence of certain officers in the service of tne Indian Government. This does not appear to us quite in accordance with legal methods. _ tor since Endand is the plaintiff, it is scarcely right that the witnesses ior the plaintiff should be English. Nevertheless, their statements all confirm the relation between Koweit and Turkey, and not one of them contains anything to prove that England has any rights over Koweit; they speak of allowances made to the Sheikli of Koweit and of the duties laid upon him. Are not these all proofs of the existence of Ottoman sovereign rights ? While mentioning these proofs the ' Times claims that not one of them shows that tribute has ever been paid by the Sheikh of Koweit to the Ottoman Government. Now, although we have questioned the right of supporting an English claim by English witnesses, we have such confidence in English sincerity and uprightness that we will call an English witness to establish our rights. We do not doubt that this witness will be accepted with confidence by the ' Times,' for it is Lord Ourzon, late Governor- General of India, and a man famed for his knowledge of the Persian Gulf. Fifteen years ago. Lord Curzon wrote a book entitled ' Persia and the Persian Gulf' We will content ourselves with quoting some details about Koweit from pp. 462 and 463 of the second volume. Lord Curzon says that Ujair Harbour may be taken as the southern boundary of the territory on the El Katif coast of Turkey, and that northwards from that point the influence and sovereignty of the Ottoman Government runs and is established without dispute as far as Fao. As it is possible that we misconstrue this passage, we reproduce it here in the original ;— ' Northwards from that place the Ottoman dominion is established without dispute- as far as Fao.' On the question of payment of tribute, to which the ' Times ' attaches so much importance, Lord Curzon gives evidence in favour of Turkey, he says ' * 1S ? 0 Z consi( J ered as dependent on the villayet of Bussorah, and pays its share of tribute to Bussorah.' I his passage also we reproduce in English ; tribuW' 0 ^ n0W n0minaIly formS P art of the vma y et of Bussorah, to which it pays 1820-21 the^ritish offk'iaM a p lttl ? ear . u ^.'. us ,,oolc Lord Curzon admits that in Ottoman territory, for if Koweit h-id nnt I 'i i S P roves Koweit to be would be no meaning in the action of the Biltkb 0 ' fli ^ 0 ^® an te ™tory there Gove^t in g™* d the 0 «— a crushing answer to 0n tlUS POiut ' f ' 0r 1,01(1 Cur 2on's words afford advantage of the'weaknel'SdTm^tenTO of'thene th - S Gov , eniment . taking influence in the Persian Gulf, and has t, e,l ^ w T Ked to extend its protection.

By treaty and by law Koweit is Ottoman territory, and to-day it lives under the Ottoman Hag. England made an undertaking with the Ottoman Government not to claim a right of protection over Koweit ; but on the other hand the Ottoman Government consented not to send troops to Koweit and not to disturb the status quo. But the continuance of this state of things will be bad both with regard to the projected Bagdad--Bussorah Railway and to the maintenance of order in Mesopotamia ; so we hope that the K oweit question will be definitely settled as the result of friendly and benevolent discussion between Turkey and England. We will respect England's rights in the Persian Gulf, and in return we expect a friendly and law-abiding attitude from England in respecting indisputable Ottoman rights such as those over the Persian Gulf.[ This Document is the P rop erty o f His Britannic Majesty 's Government.] [February 20.] S ection 2.

This telegram, which I have procured confidentially, seems to show Tewfik Pasha's anxiety lest the ' Times' article should provoke a sharp and polemical rejoinder from the pen of Hussein Jahid, and it probably accounts to a certain extent for the ' Tanin's ' studiously moderate and reasonable article on the subject. 1 have, &amp;c.

THERE is an important article in to-day's ' Times' explaining the treaty concluded on the 23rd January, 1899, by Mubarek-as-Sabah, Kaimakam of Koweit, with the political officer sent by Lord Curzon, the late Viceroy of India, and showing the reasons for the treaty and what led up to it. The article suffices to show what objects are being aimed at by England in the Persian Gidf and Turkish Iraq. I therefore think it my duty to tell you that it is necessary to give such orders as will prevent the ' Tanin ' and other Turkish papers from raking up such questions by publishing that article in full and will prevent difficulties being raised against the future of the Ottoman Empire and its present affairs ; and I would add that the necessary steps should be taken to keep England in a good humour.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 20.) (No. 106.) Sir, Constantinople, February 15, 1911. IN my despatch No. 100 of yesterday, I stated that Rifaat Pasha had said that the Ottoman Government would be prepared to give Great Britain a written engagement not to alienate Koweit to ^ third Power. It is difficult to see what practical value such an engagement could have, and, to judge by your despatch dated the 20th January to the India Office, it would appear to be rather a question of obtaining, in certain contingencies, a reliable undertaking that the internal status quo of the Sheikh of Koweit's territory should be respected—a condition of things which would seem hardly compatible with the acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or sovereignty (as stated in your despatch No. 28, Secret, of the 18th January, to Sir F. Bertie). Koweit s land frontier is undefined, and has been considerably encroached on by the Turks, especially if we take as approximately accurate the map attached to volume I of W. G. Palgraves ' Central and Eastern Arabia,' where the sheikh's territory, marked in different colouring from that of Turkish and independent Central Arabia in 1865 i.e., shortly before the forward policy in those parts of Namik and Midhat Pashas—is shown as extending* north of Fao. Presumably the land frontier would have to b€&gt; defined, and stipulations made as to the administration on both sides of the line. The whole position is, in a way, vitiated by the abnormal condition of things in Constantinople, where the present Central Government can apparently maintain itself in power only in virtue of the state of siege, and would be almost certainly swept from office were the state of siege to be abolished. In an article in the ' Tanin,' Ismail Hakki Bey Babanzade, deputy for Bagdad, discusses the question of an arrangement with England concerning the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf. He says that, from the Turkish standpoint, ' the fundamental question is the Persian Gulf, and the Bagdad l\ailway takes second place, mainly because, 'on the former question, differences and misunderstandings have arisen, whereas on the latter it is only surmised that they may arise ; although Ottoman sovereignty is established and clear in the Persian Gulf, it is attacked by England at some points, whereas in the matter of the railway even England admits that Ottoman sovereignty cannot be discussed.' He goes on to say that the object of an under standing cannot be to assure important interests to England or any other Power, but should be to put an end to the rivalry of two Great Powers. &lt;s If the matter is judged with good-will it is clear that confusion cannot last, unless there is a secret aim of drawing unlawful profit from the confusion. iurkey, he says, has no such aim, but unfortunately the statements of the most important English papers do not point to England being animated by the same sincerity. The Times,' for example, talks of England insisting on having a right of ' control' over the Bagdad Railway : 'Any Ottoman statesman would be made to negotiate on the basis of control. Perhaps the talk of control is simply a scheihe to nullify the negotiations from_ the start. But never mind, for at any rate part of the dark curtain will have been raised, and some of the secret aims disclosed, which is a gain in itself. 'If reasonable and permissible questions had been discussed before this absurd proposal was put forward, a more benevolent intention would have been shown. There is the Bahrein question, and certain other questions which are claimed as corollaries of it. There are the treaties concluded with sheikhs. One ought to examine the effect these treaties have as regards third parties. Above all, there is the Koweit question, &amp;c.' Ismail Hakki Bey thus raises the questions of Bahrein, Ivatar, and the trucial chiefs, if not Muscat, and it would certainly seem politic, if not imperative, to settle definitely the status of those places, vis-d-vis Turkey, before in any way admitting Turkish pretensions to Koweit. . , . , t n i „ &gt; 1 have the honour to enclose a translation of an article in the Ikdam, a projpos of an arrangement regarding Koweit and the Gulf.

In view of the fact that negotiations are proceeding apparently rapidly and successfully between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government for the completion of the line to Bagdad, I have consulted my French colleague, who has agreed that we should submit to our respective Governments the need of taking some prompt and energetic action in order to prevent some surprise such as that of the Potsdam agreement. We suggest that our action might take the form of a joint communication to the Sublime Porte to the effect that all negotiations connected with the completion of the line to Bagdad must be taken conjointly with France and Great Britain. We should add that our Governments consider it quite insufficient for the Ottoman Government to submit an agreement already arrived at, and that we cannot hold out to the Sublime Porte any hope of our agreeing to the 4 per cent, increase failing a preliminary agreement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made an evasive reply to the questions which I put to him to-day regarding the course oi the negotiations.

Instructions on the subject have been sent to M, Cambon, who has been directed to speak to you in regard thereto. M.

According to the ' Tanin,' a paper in close relations with the Ministry of Finance, an annual increase of £ T. 60,000 on the revenues already put aside for the construction of the line will suffice for the extension of the line to Bagdad, and the 4 per cent, increase on the customs duties has no connection with this. It is conceivable that the .£ T. 60,000 represents the difference between the amount needed, including working expenses and guarantee, for the line from Halif to Bagdad and £ T. 334,000 surplus of tithes and revenue.

ABOUT two years ago, at an interview you granted me, I ventured to urge the importance of coming to an agreement with Germany regarding the Bagdad Railway, and explained that, having regard to the fact of M. von Gwinner, the president of the Bagdad Railway Company, being my cousin, I was in a favourable position to negotiate a commercial agreement, of which the basis would have been the control by English capital of the southern part of the line from Bagdad to the Persian Gull I expressed myself sanguine with regard to the result of such negotiations. Your reply was to the effect that, while the proposal in itself might be acceptable, nothing could be done without &lt;c une conversation a cjuatre, as you could not act without the knowledge and consent of France and Russia. The Germans declined to discuss the matter on that basis, and the matter dropPt resiimec [ ]jy Si r Ernest Cassel, with your knowledge, and, as I understand, with your consent, but without result. In the meantime the Persian question entered upon a more acute phase. Ine British Government's note to the Persian Government alarmed the lurks. 1 he claims nut forward by Great Britain as to her rights and privileges m the Persian Guit section increased Turkish suspicion, so that the chances of Turkey agreeing to Germany ceding that portion of the concession to build the southern section of the Bagdad Railway to British capitalists are now very much reduced, if indeed they have not ''^foS'tderstaading has removed Russia from the group of Powers supposed by the Turks to be antagonistic to the Bagdad Railway enterprise. The position was further complicated by the lurkish loan negotiations, wh lc terminated in the signing of a contract with Germany for 11,000,0001. Turkish bonds aftpr France and England had declined to assist Turkey. . , t , -n * When I saw Sir Arthur Nicolson shortly afterwards he said that the Foreign Office did Dot then encourage British capital being put at the disposal of the lurkish Government, and at my interview with you in January you confirmed that, although von were not altogether averse to British investments m lurkey.

Negotiations with Bagdad Railway Company are being conducted on the following- basis, according to a voluntary statement made to me to-day by the Minister for Foreign Affairs :~ No revenues, such as future 'temettu,' 1 future monopolies, surplus of ceded revenues, or 4 per cent., beyond those already accorded, to be asked for by the railway company. The Turkish Government would probably grant the company an outlet at Alexandretta and call on it to give up its right to construct the section from Bagdad to the Gulf which was in a fair way of being reached, the internationalisation of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section, though remaining an Ottoman railway, would be proposed by the Porte to Great Britain and Powders interested, the suggestion being that France, Germany, ourselves, and possibly Turkey, should join in acquiring shares. Although Bussorah could easily be turned into the outlet, the Turkish Government would prefer Koweit, but for that an arrangement with Great Britain as to its political status would be necessary. His Excellency observed that, from the standpoint of Turkey, the preservation of the present status quo was impossible, and obviously Ottoman territory was the only terminus for an Ottoman railway. His Excellency added that the international syndicate should also build the terminal port. Rifaat Pasha asked me to keep what he had said secret, and observed that his object in speaking to me had been to let His Majesty's Government know the general view of the Ottoman Government in the matter; and that he would eventually communicate the proposals of the Turkish Government in writing. His Excellency added that he would use similar language to the French Ambassador. [February 14.] S ection 3. [1889 o—3]£^1 B ocmk -: v . 18 f ± Z .

After briefly recapitulating; l: '' J ' sll ., ) ' s ^ ailc e tbe remarks attributed to Rifaat Pasha which were, as given here, to tiie ctt'eci. that the Bagdad Railway Company had an undoubted right to build the line ^ Persian Gulf, and that all negotiations connected with the scheme would be con due t ed^ by the lurkish (government direct with the company and not with the German Government, the ' Norddeutsche ' reproduces, by way of comment on this statement, a telegram sent to the '' Kolnische Zeitung' by its Berlin correspondent, which sums up the official German attitude at the present moment in the whole question. After emphasising the readiness of the Bagdad Railway Company to welcome the participation of English and French capital in the enterprise, the ' Kolnische ' says that Germany has absolutely no reason for fearing such participation or for objecting to as much publicity as possible being given to the objects and mode of execution of the scheme. The writer then goes on to observe that if other people had been equally disinterested the railway might by this time have been completed, and then no doubt would have been left as to its real character, which was that of a great transversal line, intended in the first place to open up the more inaccessible parts of Turkey, and in the second to benefit equally the-commerce of all nations. ' In the consciousness that the line is intended to serve these purposes alone,' says the ' Kolnische,' ' Germany may camly await the development of the situation without being made nervous by criticisms of the foreign press, which have no justification in fact.' The ' Hamburger Nachrichten ' also reproduces the telegram from the ' Kolnische Zeitung,' stating that it was probably inspired by the Deutsche Bank. It then goes on to quote a recent announcement in the 'Neue Politische Korrespondenz ' to the effect that up to now negotiations between Germany and England with regard to the Bagdad Railway had failed in consequence of the English demand for the inter- nationalisation of the line—a demand which it was held on the German side Turkey could not accept, as the Bagdad Railway was a Turkish enterprise, which was only being financed and carried out by Germans. The ' Hamburger Nachrichten says that, should England again attempt to obtain any control over the line, she couid only be successful on the condition of her unreservedly assuring to Turkey complete sovereign rhdits over the whole railway. Finally the article discusses the question of the terminus of the line on the Persian Gulf, ' where Persian, Turkish, and Arab territory meet, the latter nominally under Turkish sovereignty but in reality partly independent and partly under British control.' After observing that it was formerly generally admitted that the line must terminate at Koweit, the writer quotes •'an apparently semi-official statement ' in the ' Miinehener Neueste Nachrichten saying that the opinion is p-ainin^ around that Bussorah will have to be chosen as the terminus of the railway instead of Koweit The 'Hamburger Nachrichten' concludes-by saying that it quite concurs in this view, as it would be much better that the line should, from beginning to end, be built on Turkish territory.

Gambon to-day, verbally, the substance of my conversation with Count Benckendorff yesterday, omitting any reference to the details of German participation m the 1 ehran—Khanikm branch railway and to the neutral zone in Persia. M. Cambon took the same view as I did as to what M. Sazonow had done at St. Petersburgh with regard to the Bagdad Railway, and said that it was more than ever necessary that France and we should keep in close touch and act in accord. I concurred in this. M. Cambon added that M. Sazonow had informed the French Ambassador in St. Petersburgh that, owing to the publication of the draft agreement, the draft, would have to be set aside, and some time would be required to arrange matters. M. Cambon understood that M. Sazonow had said to Sir George Buchanan not only that time would be required, but that in the course of further discussion the arrangement with Germany might have to be extended, so as to embrace more than was comprised in the negotiations at Potsdam. I added that M. Sazonow had said that only what related to the Bagdad Railway would be put in writing, and that whatever else there might be would not be in writing. I then told M. Cambon that, if we received a proposal as to the Bagdad Railway from either Germany or Turkey, we would try to get the best possible. terms in connection with the section from Bagdad to the Gulf. But we would not make a definitive arrangement without consulting the French Government and keeping in touch with them. M. Cambon asked me what arrangement would be possible, for he understood that we had told Djavid Bey that we could not agree to the conversion of the Bagdad- Gulf section into a Turkish railway. T replied that, on the contrary, we had told Djavid Bey that if the Gulf section was to be a Turkish railway, and the Turks would employ British engineers, materials, &amp;c., an arrangement might be possible. As to Koweit, if the Turks would guarantee the status quo of the sheikh's position we would recognise Turkish suzerainty over the whole district. ^ r _ l . _ The information that we were prepared to recognise iurkish suzerainty over Koweit seemed to be new to M. Cambon. He said that a Turkish railway made by British engineers and British materials, with a British director, and a harbour constructed and managed by us, seemed to oiler a possible solution. I asked him what France would require. He answered that the Bagdad-Horns line would be of no use until Mesopotamia was made profitable by irrigation. France would, however, ask for the preference m making this line if Turkey ever decided to have it built. _ This he regarded as a rather remote contingency. France would also ask for the junction oi the Aleppo line with the Bagdad Railway; for the Samsun-Sivas line ; and^ perhaps also some small railway in the north. After all that had passed, Russia ought to agree to this. I said that in any case we must keep in touch, and we must both see that ^ done „ . 1» » written off. X am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

V\ 1 1 H. reierence to rny despatch No. 10G of the 15th instant, I have the honour to report that the local press here has recently contained several comments on the 'negotiations ' proceeding between the Porte and this embassy on the subject of the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway, Koweit, and pending questions in the Persian Gulf, and that several newspaper correspondents have addressed themselves to this Embassy for inlormation on the subject. 1 have told them that no such negotiations have begun, and that when they do their success will not be facilitated by my giving information as to the course of their progress. These rumours are in part, traceable to the Turkish Cabinet, some members of which are anxious to represent that delicate negotiations are in progress with England, and their success would be endangered by prolonging or pushing to extremes the present Ministerial crisis. They are thus partly the outcome of party political manoeuvres. In an interview I had yesterday with the Grand Vizier, his Highness had practically nothing to add to Rifaat Pasha's communication reported in my despatch No. 100 of the 11th instant. I informed him, , ■ as instructed in your telegram No. 40 of the 16th instant, of your readiness to consider any proposals that the Ottoman Government might make on the subject. Hakki Pasha referred to Rifaat Pasha's communication, and said that the difficulty was that they could not begin negotiations with us until they had settled with the German company the basis of their renunciation of their rights in the Bagdad-Gulf sections, and that before arriving at such a settlement it was necessary to ascertain and lay down the general nature of the arrangements to be made for the continuation of the line from Bagdad to the Gulf. He alluded to the pecuniary indemnity claimed by the German company, when Herr Gwinner had discussed matters with Sir Ernest Cassel in Berlin, on the basis of 2,000Z. per kilometre on the Bagdad-Gulf sections, as a set-oft' against the prospective diminution of profit on the working expenses on the other and more expensive sections of the line, and said that Koweit was of course the ^ natural terminus and harbour, but that, if it was impossible to come to a satisfactory arrangement on that point, Bussorah would have to become the terminus, despite its obvious drawbacks, and, referring to Koweit, remarked that '^England imght teel assured that any place she recognised as Turkish would remain lurkish. liakki Pasha's use of the word 'recognise,' if intentional, would seem to indicate ins contemplating the possibility of being unable to induce England to recognise the place as Turkish in the committee's acceptation of the word. On the latter point Ismail 1 Ukki Bey Babanzade, in an article in the ' Tanin ' of which 1 have the honour to enclose a translation, gives us the committee standpoint. He would only ^ , ^ e . 8h |^ h Vj autonomy of any Mesopotamian Arab tribes, e.g., the Bern Lam, Muntelik &amp;c., a would insist on having Ottoman police, customs, and gendarmerie m Koueit th restoring Ottoman influence, which has suffered some sort oi interrupUon WO- to its original condition.' He seems conveniently to ignore the fact that pevw - that date' Turkey can point to no real act of sovereignty in taxes or direct administration in any form.

Precis of Article in the ' Tanin ' 0/ February 20, 1911. Discussion about an Entente with England. FOR some time there lias been keen anticipation of discussion for bringing about an entente between the Ottoman Government and England concerning the Persian Gulf the last section of the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c., and the latest information goes to show that the fonnd at ion-stone is to be laid by an exchange of views between Kitaat Pasha and Sir Gerard Lowther. The opinion expressed by the former, that such important questions ought to be discussed by statesmen and not in the columns 0 newspapers, is thus confirmed. To judge by the unreasonable claims of the ' Times ' and similar papers, there was no hope of peace between the two parties. But in the more moderate papers there has appeared a change full of promise. For instance, the ' Statist says that it is the act of a novice for England to play an ambitious, grasping role ; that Turkey has the right to increase her resources, and therefore cannot remain without railways ; that England has no right of veto over the extension of the Bagdad Railway in Turkey ; and that once upon a time many English politicians opposed the Suez Canal project. Ihis attitude shows us that the sense of what is right is not quite extinguished in. the English, which brings us hope and consolation. Nevertheless, there are still inconsistencies caused by ignorance. For instance, a telegram from London to a French paper says that the English Cabinet will confirm Ottoman sovereign rights over Koweit without difficulty, provided the sheikh's autonomy is respected and the harbour of Koweit is left in English hands. Koweit harbour lias nothing to do with England even now. Is it to be anglicised as a reward when Turkey has adopted a favourable policy towards England with regard to the last section of the Bagdad Railway ? How can the expressions ' Ottoman sovereignty ' and 'English harbour' be reconciled? To tell the truth, the telegram is nonsense ; and we think such a scheme is no more likely to be put forward by England than to occur to Turkey. The real bone of contention is the Persian Gulf. With regard to the Bagdad Railway, there is no diagreement between the two Powers, and officially there cannot be; it is a weapon—a dependent question—which will serve to settle the main question. We do not know how far our views are shared officially; but if there is one thing certain, it is that our consenting to listen to England's aims and objects with regard to the Bagdad Railway is a great favour and sacrifice. There is mutual sacrifice in a bargain ; and we ask England for her views on the last section of the Bagdad Railway, and tell her to give up her important position in the Koweit and other questions. That is the first foundation-stone of an entente. We think England is coming round to this view. The object of ' control ' is now- seen to mean preponderant participation in providing the capital, English being a language which admits of such elasticity. All the row about the word ' control ' must therefore be attributed to the elasticity of English. If the matter had been a piece of plain business, there would have been no need for discussion with the British Ambassador about the railway; there would have been negotiations between the Ministry of Public Works and the company which was willing to provide^ the capital. But as the real object was the Koweit and Persian Gulf questions, it was felt that diplomatic approval was needed. When the basis of the cntertie has been laid with regard to the political and diplomatic points, the commercial3 soft f?' i 0f the t0 resulne its natural course and to leave the sott catspaw of diplomacy with its hidden claws. Our estimate and firm conviction is this— 1. rhat the first caiise of hesitation will be removed bv fixing on Koweit as the terminus ot the Bagdad Railway. ' . 2. Tiie Sheikh of Koweit's autonomy will be maintained in accordance with the principles followed with regard to tribes ; but as the position of Koweit will increase in importance and delicacy there will have to be police, customs, and gendarmerie in the hamorr, and they will be Ottoman. In this way Ottoman inline ice, which has suttered some sort of interruption since 1902, will return to its original condition. A narboui will have Uj be built in Ivoweit, and there is no objection to its being constructed with foreign capital ; but the position of the harbour will not differ from that of any other of our harbours which have been built by foreign capital. Our advantage lies in putting an end to the doubtful position of Koweit, while that of England consists in being easy in her mind and not afraid of a (undecypherable) which interests her commerce a great deal. The extraordinary advantage that will accrue to Indian commerce is different—-for the Bagdad Railway will give it life as the Suez Canal gave life to England. This means that in order to gain the trifling advantage of a clearer definition of Turkey's position in Ivoweit we practically give England a future security and life—a bargain in which England is again the gainer. But we allow ourselves to be taken in over this bargain in order to extend our future friendly relations with England. If the ' Times' and its like complain at this sign of friendship, and Lord Crewe, Lord Lansdowne, and others again sow the seeds of coldness by references wounding to Ottoman dignity, England will be harmed not by us but by English statesmen.[T his QoeaiL'ent is th e Prog ei ■; d His Britannic Majasty E C3-o¥er imet:t, eastern department secret series.

In return for this, His Majesty's Government might admit, and advise the sheikh to admit, Turkish suzerainty over Koweit to the full extent compatible with:— (a.) The complete autonomy of Koweit in respect of its internal administration, to be guaranteed by a firman to the sheikh, and confirmed by a written undertaking to His Majesty's Government, as proposed by Colonel Cox. (5.) The maintenance of our agreements with the sheikh. (c.) Fhe recognition by Turkey of Um Kasr, Bubiyan, and Warba as part of Koweit territory under Turkish suzerainty, and the withdrawal of Turkish guards and symbols of authority therefrom. A reasonable settlement of all property disputes, the sheikh taking out Turkish papers for his son, should also be included in the negotiations; and it would further be understood that, if the question of tribute is not raised, the sheikh will approach the division of customs duties, &amp;c., in a liberal spirit. Whether the Turkish Government will be prepared to negotiate on this basis will presumably depend largely upon the value which they attach to considerations mainly of a sentimental order. On the other hand, the concession which His Majesty's Government are prepared to make, in facilitating the use of Koweit as a terminus for the Bagdad Railway, is of a very substantial nature ; and in considering what we may reasonably expect to receive in return it must be borne in mind that the position which His Majesty's Government have built up for themselves at Koweit, and fortified by formal agreements with the sheikh, is—together with the similar position which they hold at Mohammerah—the one solid asset that they possess in those regions, and that they have been at pains to acquire it precisely for some such purpose as that to which it is now proposed to put it; while, quite apart from all question of compensation, this same position makes it impossible for them (as Mr. Marling has pointed out in his despatch No. 14 of the 4th January last) to abandon the sheikh to the Turks without such a loss of prestige as would be disastrous to their general policy and interests in the Persian Gulf. . For these reasons Lord Crewe would regard the conditions recapitulated above as essential to a satisfactory settlement. It is clear that in any negotiations that may be opened great care must be taken to avoid making any admissions with regard to t e status of Koweit that may be used to our detriment should the whole negotiations [1932 c—1] \1prove abortive, or should some place other than Koweit eventually he adopted as the 30t}i December, 1910 (annextd J. j alJ1 &amp; c R.

Corbett to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 6.) (No. 17.) ^ Ir &gt; r i . Munich, March 2, 1911. THE qiiestion of the Bagdad Railway continues in no slight degree to occupy public attention here. ^ Statements made on the subject in Parliament and the articles that appear in the British press are closely followed by the German newspapers, which lose no opportunity of insisting that the question is one that primarily concerns Turkey and Germany and only very indirectly Great Britain. The ' Frankfurter Zeitung ' of to-day's date treats the matter at some length and with more than the usual frankness. After contrasting the attitude of the British and (rerman press very much to the advantage of the latter, the writer of the article goes on to observe that, in spite of all that has been written about it in England, British journalists have not yet succeeded in acquiring that clearness of thought on the subject which is so desirable. ' England's dominion in India,' says the writer, her supremacy in the waters of the Persian Gulf, and her alleged protectorate over the Turkish town of Koweit are made the ground for claims which have direct reference to indisputably Turkish territory ; and—most important point of all—the English Govern ment is to be forced to claim for England the control over the so-called last section of the railway, that is to say, over a distance of some 600 kilom. from Bagdad southwards to the Persian Gulf. The granting of this claim is to be the sine qua non for reasonable and friendly relations with Turkey and Germany. Some particularly truculent journalists even talk about an assurance in this sense or a danger to the peace of the world. ' The question of the railway might be treated with far better hope of a satisfactory solution for England if our neighbours on the other side of the channel could get rid of a habit which is clearly deeply ingrained in their nature of confusing claims and rights. It seems to be an indisputable fact that England does claim an alleged protectorate over Koweit, and similarly the so-called control over the final section of the railway. This, however, is not the question : the point simply is, what rights England has over the terminus and final section of the future line. I he wiser part of the English press advances no basis at all for such a right, and no one can take in earnest the grounds alleged by less prudent journals. No one will wish to prevent England from assuring her dominion in India, but to make the securing of the niastery in India an excuse for establishing English rights over ports and railways in South Mesopotamia is as absurd as it would be to claim a suzerainty over Southern Italy. TCoweit is just about as far from the nearest point on the Indian frontier as Portsmouth is from Naples. In the question of the alleged English protectorate over Koweit the Turks are notoriously of a different opinion from the English, and we have no reason to believe that their conception is the less well grounded oi the two. But whether the solution of the question ultimately gives England a partial or a complete protectorate over Koweit, her claims concerning the southern section of the line are not m the east advanced thereby. To argue from a protectorate over Koweit to a control oi the railwavs in South Mesopotamia is like claiming control over the whole hpamsh rtulnaj, system on the strength of the possession of Gibraltar. It is certain, however that opinion in England on this point is now following a more reasonable line, and this i. satisfactory.

In either case, the river steamers serving the same regions would be most unfairly handicapped by competition with a subsidised railway line. It the State guarantee for the railway be found through increased customs du t&gt;^ we Uust that His Maiestv's Government realise the extent of the increased burden which would thus be placed upon British trade.

In this new form they were again submitted to the Turkish Cabinet, with a request that they should fulfil their promise to conclude the business. There the matter rested. The Turkish Government for some time refused to give any answer whatever, and ultimately attached wholly new conditions to their acceptance— conditions which destroyed the entire basis of the agreement. They refused to hand over to the proposed new company their own exclusive rights, but failed to indicate how under these circumstances we should be able to comply with their stipulation for an equal share in the enterprise. Moreover, they had stipulated that the new company should undertake various duties, such as the conveyance of Imperial mails, and the transport of material, troops, and stores at special rates, which obviously could not be imposed upon a company subjected to free competition. Hilmi Pasha, when Grand Vizier, had very carefully considered the question of transferring these exclusive rights of navigation, and had come to the conclusion, on the merits of the question, that the new company must enjoy such rights. He had the case of the steamers on the Bosphorus under consideration at the time, and recognised that the absence of exclusive rights would give rise to such a conflict of interests and consequent uncertainty of reward as would render an efficient service impossible. This is how the matter stands at present, and we should of course be pleased if any plan can be devised, which would reconcile the different points of view, to give it careful consideration.

I HAVE the honour to report that your speech in the House of Commons on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and Koweit questions has, according to the ' Nord- deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,' made a very favourable impression in official circles. ' Your statesmanlike speech,' that paper says, ' clearly shows the lines on which an understanding can be discussed and arrived at, both as regards the raising of the Turkish customs dues and the building of the railway from Bagdad to the Gulf.' The Imperial Chancellor told me this evening that it was he himself who had caused this paragraph to be inserted, and he asked me to tell you how much he appreciated your clear and conciliatory language on these two questions. His Excellency also said that he was glad to be able to say that he noted a general improvement in the relations between the two countries. This opinion was, he told me, shared by Count Metternich, whom no one could ever accuse of exaggerated optimism. The Chancellor did not mention the question of Koweit, but the press this evening has much to say on the subject. As the messenger leaves to-morrow morning, I have not time to give more than the briefest summary of their remarks. The ' Vossische Zeitung ' says, while expressing itself very favourably as regards your statement regarding the Bagdad Railway, that it cannot on the other hand agree with your observations respecting Koweit. It says that though the lurkish sovereignty over Koweit has for many years laid dormant it nevertheless exists, and that though through this sovereignty not having been made effective Great Britain has been able to obtain a footing there, the treaties she has made with the Sheikh of Koweit cannot lie held as valid, as they are not recognised by Turkey. It adds that things now are not as they were, and, that with the regeneration of Turkey, a thorough examination and exchange of views on the subject between the two Powers concerned cannot be much longer del^The ' Kreuz-Zeitung,' at the close of a long historical article on the subject of the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, says that the necessity of putting an end to all doubts on this question has now become acute, and that, as it is in itseli a question of right, the Court of Arbitration at The Hague would seem to be the proper place to have the matter definitely thrashed out. It adds that though it can har y be supposed that, as the first and foremost champion of the principle of arbitration Great Britain could refuse such a proposal were it to be made to hei by Turkey, sti it cannot be denied that there are certain difficulties arising out of the general situation xv Vhp I i striTicl in tlic way oi sucli ci solution* , ji id *&lt;.* 'l In a second article on the same subject, the ' Kreuz,' after scofhng at the Bnt.sh idea that in this question Germany stands behind Turkey, quotes largeh irom i a an s articles and 'specially from an article by that wnter m the Natrona) He view of articles ana espe y ^ couclusloI1 that as i ong as Germany s Septembei 1J0-, in w nicb ne Bagdad Railway, as far nearest harbour to the 1 er , sia ' qI10 da ' n „er to Great Britain.

Still, the idea is not new, and the creation of British spheres of influence in Persia may have been a preliminary to such a step should events render it necessary. Another way would be the formation of a strong naval squadron with its base ^ on the Indian coast, whose duty it would be to close the entrance to the Gulf when necessary. In both cases Great Britain would be true to her traditional policy of letting no straits or narrow seas of any strategic importance fall into the hands of a great sea power. Both of these methods would, of course, cost a great deal of money, and would be a heavy charge on both the English and Indian exchequers ; they would, moreover, necessarily give rise to considerable difficulties and discussions. . _ 1 .- pi ' There is, however, a third way for Great Britain to realise her aims if she really considers it so vital to her interests to keep any foreign maritime Power out of the Persian Gulf ; it is, perhaps, open to her to arrive at that result by diplomatic means. Whether liussia would lend herself to an arrangement on the lines desired by England is a question by itself. First and foremost it is a question between Great Britain and Germany, and as Germany's interests in the East are of a commercial and not a political nature, an understanding between the two Powers on the subject of the Persian Gulf would appear to be by no means impossible. ■' The particular question of Kow r eit is in itself a juridical matter—a question of rights. If, as such, it was an isolated question, Turkey could not do better than propose to Great Britain that it should be referred to The Hague tribunal. It is, however, not an isolated question, but one closely bound up with the numerous political and strategical problems of the Persian Gulf. But the whole Koweit question would lose its importance, and the solution of the southern section of the Bagdad Railway become comparatively easy, if only an Anglo-German Persian Gulf under standing could be arranged which would pay due regard to G reat Britain's special position and her political and strategic interests.' This is the concluding sentence of the article, and there is no mention of what concessions or advantages Germany would, in the writer's opinion, expect to gain from such an understanding. As, however, the article from which I have quoted is one of a series, the German side of the question may possibly appear in a subsequent issue of the ' Kreuz-Zeitung. 1 have, &amp;c.

Extract from the 'Morning Post' of March 15, mi.— {Received at Foreign Office, March 15, 1911.) Bagdad Railway Question : French Government's Attitude. [From a French Correspondent.] J HE attitude of the trench Government towards the Bagdad Railway question cannot be tlioroughly understood without a short historical retrospect. For a very ioiig tune, in tact until the year 1902, French policy in respect of the Bagdad scheme vsas rather unsteady. [he idea of connecting Asia Minor with the Persian Gulf, which the German engineer, W. von Pressed launched iii 1871, could not appeal to France more than to England, since all the previous English or French schemes had always contemplated the linking of the Persian Gulf and of Mesopotamia with the echelles of the Levant^ on the Mediterranean coast. Owing to the importance of French settle ments in ^yria such a line as the Mediterranean-Bagdad Railway recommended in 1856 by Sir John MacNeilJ and General Chesney would have suited France much betcer than the German plan. Still, it appeared from the first that the Turks them selves would, tor strategical reasons, prefer the German scheme to the English one, their main wish being to connect Constantinople with the remotest parts of their Empire. i heretore the trench Government never offered a blind opposition to the new enterprise, ' uriously enough,'it was a French company, the Compagnie Fives-Lille, which constructed the first line from Haidar-Pacha to Ismid in 1871-73. A new situation arose, however, when a German company secured in 1888 the concession from Ismid to Angora with the promise of an ulterior extension towards Bagdad. With a little more energy it was generally thought at the time that France might have secured the concession for herself. But now the Deutsche Bank had the railway and meant business. In 1893 the German rails reached Angora, and the Anatolian company secured two more concessions—one from Angora to Kaisarieh, which was left untouched ; the other from Eskisher to Konieh, which removed from north to south the route to be followed by the future Bagdad line. A double menace was thereby offered to French interests. First of all, the French lines in Asia Minor were shut out from any extension towards the east or the south. Such was the case with the line from Mudania to Brusa, and later on with the Smyrna—Kassaba line, after the latter had been bought by French financiers from an English company. In the second place, the Bagdad line was to take the Syrian route instead of crossing the Kurdistan ; it was bound to injure the Mersina-Adana line, worked by an Anglo- French company, and might prevent any further extension of the French lines in Syria. Had England joined hands with France at that moment it might have been possible to interfere in an efficient way with the somewhat ambitious schemes of the Germans. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The French Ambassador in Constantinople (then M. Paul Cambon) had to act alone. He therefore confined himself to asking for a sufficient compensation. Owing to his successful efforts France secured not only the railway from Damascus to Aleppo, including any future line which might connect that railway with the coast, but she was allowed to extend the Damascus-Aleppo line as far north as Birejik. Had the French financiers taken advantage of that very important concession they would have found themselves in an exceptionally strong position when the Bagdad line, after crossing the Taurus, would have found its route barred by a French railway already in operation. It was not the French Ambassadors fault that the construction of the Aleppo-Birejik Railway was not pushed in time, and that the German company easily managed to take over that part of the concession in 1903. It was only in 1902 that the policy of the French Government, in view of the imminent agreement between the Turks and the Anatolian company, over the Bagdad line, became definite Nobody failed to perceive then that a misunderstanding had arisen between the French Foreign Office and the representatives of French interests [1932 p—1]t Iwl been arrived at between tbe in Constautinople. ^f^dMs^the S^^jgillcL been ^extended'as tar as Atiun Karahissar on the Gemau^oute), t ^ ^ had niade up their mind to have a share m the Koxneh ^ was to keep .or part in the Turoo -German n ff ' ; e ' nt ' 0 f the capital in tbe new P .. . ... ultimately'W AmWdor. _M.

Delcasse's decision with great firmness. The opportunity ior nig came in December, 1909. A few months before a syndicate had been formed m blasus with the object of constructing the section of the Bagdad line which extends from Bulgurlu to El Hehf; it had been promoted by the Ottoman Bank in oidei t'&lt; ! effect to its participation in the railway, and included four French members. Questioned in the French Chamber on the 27th December,, M. Pichon emphatically denied that the French Government had withdrawn its opposition to the scheme. To the two conditions mentioned by his predecessor, M. Delcasse, he now added a third one : England ought to be allowed to participate in the enterprise as well as Russia and France. On our side, he said, ' we have always held the view that, if a call were to be made upon our financial credit, we ought, as far as possible, to act in the sense of the inter- nationalisation of the line, and this view T we continue to hold. After repeating that he made M. Delcasse's declarations his own, the Minister for Foreign Affairs added : 'We continue to watch the negotiations which are being conducted on this subject. The House may rest assured that I have not failed to confer with the British Government, as well as with the Russian Government, on this question, and I have not failed to discuss it with the Germans when they mentioned the matter to me. In a word, we have not ceased to look for the possible settlement of this important question in an equitable co-operation on the part of the various States concerned in the enterprise on the basis of a share for ourselves equal to that of the most favoured anion- the states.' Lastly, M. Pichon declared on the 16th January, 191L, that even after the Potsdam negotiations he did not intend to depart W the policy already defined Tbs means that the Bagdad Railway Company-unless M. Cruppi should take a dtfeient line—is still to be excluded from the Paris Bourse until further notice Has that negative policy come to stay ? Will M.

But out of those 100,000,0007., 60,000,000?. are invested m ^ State funds ; they are not likely to suffer from the construction of the Lagdad Ivailway any more than the 4,000,000/. invested in land and real property, the 3,500,000/. invested in banks and credit institutes, or the 2,500,000/. invested in mines and industrial enterprises. As far as the railways are concerned (15,000.000/.), it is a vvell-established fact that since the Bagdad company bought the Aleppo- Birejik concession in 1903 and (he Mersina—Adana line in i 906, it is not hkely to interfere with the important French lines which are all located in Syria. Of course, German interests mav, as a result of the new enterprise, follow in Smyrna a programme of extension whicli would endanger the prosperity of some French commercial firms. But this will simply compel some of those houses to change their antiquated methods. From a purely political point of view, it is equally difficult to justify a policy of blind opposition on the part of France. Although the pan-Germanists were silly enough to shout at the top ot their v r oices that Germany was going to swallow the Ottoman Empire, it seems rather unlikely that the Bagdad company, which is only German as far as the general management is concerned, which is using nothing but native labour and has undertaken not to bring a single German colonist to Turkey, which depends upon the good-will of the Turks as well as upon non-German investors, will do much more for Germany than other lines have done for France or England. At any rate, France has very few political interests outside Syria, and cannot be very much afraid of a line which is only touching Syria's borders. As for the constitution of the company, it has nothing in itself which should prevent the admission of the Bagdad Railway on the Paris Bourse : there are indeed a great number of companies which have free access to the Paris market, in spite of the fact that their French shareholders are not properly represented on the board of directors. I nternation al C onsiderations. The French Government has, therefore, no vital reasons, as far as France herself is concerned, to insist on the conditions laid down by M. Delcasse. But other considerations of an equally imperative nature are preventing the French Foreign Office from settling at once its differences with the Bagdad Railway Company. It is almost an open secret that M. Delcasse took up the position of 1902 in order to please Russia, who strongly objected to the building of the new line. Curiously enough the Russian Press had started a campaign against French participation in the scheme in January, 1902. two months before the famous declarations made in the French Parliament. The ' Novoe Vremya, in an article written by M. Porochine, went as far as to hint that the continuation of the Franco-Bussian Alliance largely depended upon the attitude France would adopt in the matter. Russian diplomacy interfered in the same way. In taking Russia's side in a question which was to her of a greater interest than to France, M. Delcasse and, after him, M. Pichon, did nothing but their obvious duty. At the present moment Russia seems, of course, inclined to take another view of the Bagdad Railway. But even if she ceases to oppose the scheme France is not prepared to follow in her steps unless she is satisfied that she can do so without hurting English interests. This is the most important feature of the present situation, and it would be a great pity if English opinion were not aware that to-day French policy is entirely directed in the Bagdad question by the Anglo-French understanding. It is, of course, a sad fact that up to now the co-operation of French and English private interests in Constantinople has been very imperfect. On the British side the complaint has justly been made that French financiers have too often chose to increase their personal profits by joining hands with England's opponents. French financiers retort that the representatives of British interests have several times acted against France; for instance, when the British president of the Ottoman Debt supported a campaign instituted against the Societe des Tabacs ottomans, or when British financiers tried to secure the concession of the Tripoli line, which had already been promised to France. The last Tuikish loan episode, when the Ottoman Bank and the ^National Bank stood, for a moment m direct opposition to each other, is another illustration of a state of things which made some people say that in Constantinople the entente cordiale was nothing but a name. Buu the temporary clash between a few individuals interests there are indeed many good reasons to believe that it is not going to last much longer cannot exert the least influence on the policy of both Governments. When M. Pichon stated m the rrcncnParliament a month ago that the entente ^twoenthe Office had never been stronger, his declaiatious, • diplomacy supported France cartes had a very precise meaning^ « ^nt itsomise 'd it to settle the- during the Moroccan attan « 0 ^ H , Turks to an arrangement over Bagdad question until England has come vwtl he of curst, reciprocal ; British Ambassador in O^taatmopfe ^ f advice the French Foreign KinrTsr too soon rjfc — „ f «u. ^ ^ Swu Albania^ Anatolia or anywhere else . )ne thTng, however, is alre^y certain.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 65 of the loth March, 1911, relating to the Bagdad Railway question, I have the honour to report that the ' Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,' after referring in appreciative terms to the general tone of your recent statement in the House of Commons goes on to make the following observations with regard to Koweit and to the proposed 4 per cent, increase in the Turkish customs :— ' Quite apart lies the question of the proposed increase of Turkish customs dues, and the possible application of a surplus yield of duties to a kilometric guarantee on the Bagdad Railway. Nevertheless, we believe that in this question too, it will be possible to arrive at an understanding which shall fulfil the wishes of Turkey and also take into account English interests. In the concluding part of his speech, Sir Edward Grey reviewed the much discussed question of the relation of Koweit on the Persian Gulf to the Ottoman Empire. This is a matter which demands in the first place discussions with Turkey on questions of international law. We therefore prefer not to examine this point too closely, especially as it is not necessarily bound up with the question of the construction of the line down to the shores of the Gulf.' The ' Norddeutsche' remarks in conclusion that your statement on the Bagdad Railway question signals a great advance on previous British methods, which had not always been free from a certain flavour of chicanery in the matter of this particular German enterprise, ' which was destined to strengthen Turkey not only politically, but also commercially, and thereby benefit the whole civilised world.'

I ilAVE the honour to transmit herewith the translation of a speech delivered on the 5th instant in reply to the criticisms of Ismail Kemal Bey by the Grand Vizier on the subject of the liabilities of the Ottoman Government towards the Bagdad Railway Company. ion will observe that his Highness stated that, apart from the convention, i.e., of 1903, the company had a claim upon the excess revenues of the customs under the firman granting the concession, but that when the 3 per cent, increase was obtained, the company abandoned that claim. Now, when there was a question of obtaining an increase of 4 per cent, the same question presented itself. Before transmitting to you the text of the speech, 1 thought it well to inquire of his Highness whether he had been properly reported, and invited him to inform me which was the firman that granted these revenues as guarantees. At first his Highness was disposed to say that he could not carry the complicated details of the liabilities of the Ottoman Government in his head, but, after some pressure ou my part, he stated that it was not a firman, but the convention of 1908 that set aside as a guarantee the excess revenues of the debt. 1 said I could not accept that interpretation, and then read him the article of the convention dealing with that point, showing him that, if the two paragraphs were read together, it was clear that these revenues were only set aside for the prolongation of the line as far as Halif. His Highness declined to accept this view, and insisted strongly that the ' prolongement de la ligne de Bagdad meant the whole railway. For convenience of reference, I insert here the paragraph referred to ' Convention additionnelle, faisant suite a la convention du 20 fevrier, 1318 (5 mars, 1903) ' Le Gouvernement Imperial a decide de prolonger la ligne de Bagdad depuis Boulgourlou jusqu'a la localite dite Helif, situee aux abords de Mardine, et de construire un embranchement de Tel-Habesch a Alep. La longueur de cette ligne et de Teinbranchement est d'environ 840 kilom. ' L'excedent des revenus concedes a la Dette publique ayant ete afPecte au prolongement de la ligne de Bagdad, la garantie pour ces 840 kilom. de ligne sera payee sur les excedents des revenus concedes a la Dette publique a raison de 11,000 fr. par kilometre, en conformite de I'article 35 de la Convention de Bagdad. I was, however, quite unable to move his Highness on this point, although T reminded him that last year (as reported in my despatch No 276, Secret, of the 3rd May) the point of view of the Ottoman Government was that they were only bound by a moral and not a legal obligation to the continuation oi the line. Hakki Pasha was quite unable to explain how, if he relied on the 1908 convention, it had, as he stated in his speech, been necessary to obtain from the railway an abandonment of their claim to the 3 per cent, surtax. The enigma may, however, be explained by the enclosures m this embassy s despatch No. 48 of the Jth February, 190^. Imally, his Highness said that the argument was not an important one, as there was no question of the 4 per cent, surtax being required for the construction of the Halif-Bagdad section. This, of course, is true, but only because Turkey is providing for ordinary expenditure out of loans. . I then explained to his Highness again at length that our consent to tne mciease of the 4 per cent, was dependent not only on the abandonment of the claim of the 4 per cent, by the Bagdad Railway, but to a general settlement of the railway question, which would not interfere with our existing rights in those regions, and, 1 added, that to avoid any misunderstanding 1 would place our views again on paper for Kilaat lasha.

W rTErs the first reports ol your speech in Parliament on the Bagdad Railway question were received in Germany, it was generally hailed by the press as being a statesmanlike utterance, and the verdict of the ' Norddentsche Allgemeine Zeitung ' that it was ' a statement which could, without reservation, be greeted as highly gratifying' was quoted with approval in most of the South German papers. Since then your treatment of the question of the Turkish tariff and of our relations to Koweit, and the leading article in the ' Times ' on the latter subject, have been made the subject of more critical commentary. Most of the papers here only reproduce extracts from the Berlin press generally arguing that Koweit is Turkish territory and that our rights there are in the nature only of claims and not established facts, but the ' Frankfurter Zeitung ' devotes a good deal of space to the subject which it discusses on its own account. In its issue of the 10th. instant, after praising your treatment of the relations between England and the Bagdad Company by putting them on the solid basis of existing facts, the writer goes on to say that as regards the tariff it may be supposed that the British Government did not propose to put pressure on Turkey in the matter of the railway, but rather that they would not withhold their consent to the raising of the tariff as soon as they were convinced that the extra revenues would not be used for further railway construction. There were hopes that you would soon receive the desired assurance. The Turkish Minister of Finance had explained in his budget speech that his Government was negotiating with the Bagdad Railway Company about the financial securities for an extension of the line on the understanding that the company renounced its rights to the revenues produced by the proposed raising of the tariff. The writer thought himself safe in saying that the company was inclined to meet the claims of the Government in this respect, and that in this case you would keep your word and no longer withhold from Turkey a financial resource so necessary to her if she was to succeed in her difficult tasks. There was a certain obscurity, he adds, due perhaps to the deficiencies of the telegraphic message, in the report of the last part of your speech ; you spoke of the possibility of the line passing out of Turkish territory. In that case England would doubtless have to use all means in her power to preserve the status quo which had been endangered by others. But it was difficult to understand what you had meant by your allusions to the obligations of England to the Sheikh of Koweit. England and Turkey held different views on the position of Koweit, and it was natural for an English Foreign Minister to support the views of his countrymen. A compromise between the two Powers was presumably possible, particularly seeing that you had not identified yourself with the theory, so often repeated by the English press, that Koweit was an English protectorate. If England had really only the desire to fulfil certain obligations towards the sheikh, a way out of the difficulty might be found which would not violate the Turkish rights of sovereignty. As far as the Bagdad Railway was concerned, it might be observed that the name of Koweit did not occur in the concession. The company was entitled to construct a line from Zobeir in the neighbourhood of Bussorah to some point on the Persian Gulf to be decided on between the Imperial Government and the holders of the concession. In consequence the harbour of Koweit, however many advantages it might have, was not the necessary terminus of the line. I have, &amp;c. VINCENT CORBETT. [March 17. | S ection 3.

Company abandons right to build Bagdad to Persian Gulf section with proviso that no foreign Power shall have a larger share thon Germany in the company to be formed for its construction.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. 1 ice-Consul Smith to Sir G. Lowther. Adana, March 6, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that during the first few days of this month, owing to the Seihun River being in flood, a considerable amount of damage has been done to the works which are being carried on for the construction of the Bagdad Railway bridge over the river at Adana. The floods were not so severe as last year and, except to the bridge, little damage has been done. In order to transport material to the east bank of the river, for the construction of the sections to Missis and beyond, a temporary bridge carrying the line had been built, supported by two stone piers and a large number of wooden trestles. Fifty yards above this the permanent bridge (iron girder supported by concrete piers) was in course of construction, and the work was well advanced when the flood came. The temporary bridge has now been entirely swept away, and part of the frame-work of the permanent bridge was also carried away. The damage done is said to amount to from 4,000/. to 8,0001., and it is expected that the destruction of the bridge will con siderably delay work on the line to the east of the river. There is now no means of transporting material to that side except by the town bridge, a detour of about miles, by which cart transport alone is possible. It is said that the engineers do not propose to reconstruct the temporary bridge, but to proceed as fast as possible with the construction of the permanent one. I hope in a short time to be able to report more fully on the progress made in the construction of the railway. 1 have, &amp;c. IAN M. SMITH.

W1 LH reference to my despatch No. 156 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to transmit to yon herewith a translation of an article by Hussein Diahid in the ' Tanin ' on the Bagdad Railway. J he writer says that lurkey will pay no attention to the claim over Koweit, made by the ' Times ' on behalf of England, and states that Turkey does not need Koweit harbour in order to build the Bagdad Railway and to carry the line to the shores of the Persian Gulf. If England raises difficulties against the construction of the terminus at Koweit, that will not prevent the construction of the line. The ' Times, he goes on to say, seems to think that the invitation to England to enter into negotiations was dictated by fear or necessity. This is far from being the case, and Turkey will expect some return for the courtesy and friendship shown to England. But if Turkish friendship is rejected, then Turkey need no longer consider British commercial interests. In any case, it cannot be believed that England will be guilty of such injustice, in spite of the advice of the ' Times,' as to use her consent to the increase of the customs as a weapon in the Bagdad Railway question. In connection with this last point, I enclose an article from the ' Jeune Turc,' by a German Socialist student of economy, which contends that the increase of the customs dues to 15 per cent, ad valorem will be an economic blunder on the part of Turkey. There is no doubt that there is considerable logic in this point of view, as an increase of the customs duty to 15 per cent, on such primary necessities as, e .g., sugar, would constitute an ail but unbearable burden on the lower classes, whose general standard of living is very low. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the ' Tanin ' of March 14, 1911. (Translation.) The Bagdad Railway. WE are always talking about this question, but we consider it our duty, at the risk of boring our readers, to follow every phase of the question, on account of its importance with, regard both to Irak and to our foreign policy. Our prophecy that the Bagdad Railway question would give rise to a dispute between the German and British presses has not been falsified. The ' Times ' article we reproduce to-day is written with the heat—nay, the bitterness—caused by this dispute. Let the English papers and the German press quarrel as much as they like, but it should not be forgotten when the English press is replying to the German papers, which are walking hand in hand with Ottoman interests on this question, that contempt for the Ottoman Government and mdifference to Ottoman public opinion will cause sorrow^ and astonishment in Turkey. It is not our fault that the German papers have said that England can take part in the negotiations as conciliator, so why should the English press talk in a manner wounding to our amour-jyropre, our rights, and our feelings ? The English, German, and French, or any other press must understand that to-day the Ottomans have a [1932 w—2] BRMMWINHIWJ JifllNUUI I I human -i i + with foehn^s of tli6 loftiest and puresi heart, and ihat crus hed, but it can never, even for a day, bow patriotism ^We'beg ^em W rcmemljer this, and to give np the tone to the insults of foK .^derstand insult and store it up m our hearts.

And ther VhTBa S Xd U RarW qulstion is not the Koweit question, England andjhirkey have undertaken by mutual agreement to maintain the statu* quo m Koweit. Wdi let the question stay at that. We do not need Koweit harbour m order to build the Bagdad Railway and to carry the Bagdad -Bussorah section to the shores of the leisian Gulf. If- the terminus is not at Koweit, it can be somowhere else on the sea , s o if England refuses to recognise our right, and raises iitliculties against having tn&lt; terminus at Ivoweit, that cannot prevent oui constructing ii* iiJie. This will not do as much harm ; but what will England gain ? She does not come as conciliator into the negotiations now beginning with regard to the Persian Gulf and the Bagdad Railway; but she must also remember that she does not come in as a conqueror whose will is law. It is our first desire to be on friendly terms with England, and that is why we took into consideration England's commercial interests in Irak, and her position in the Persian Gulf, and invited her to negotiate, in order to avoid misunderstandings and to lay the foundations of a sound and lasting friendship. Our object was to get a clear idea of England's point of view and to reconcile English and Ottoman interests, and to do nothing to wound a Government whose friendship we desired. To judge by the language of the 'Times,' one would think we had taken this course either from fear or from necessity; it holds such language and makes such demands as might be heard, not when friendly negotiations are being entered into, but when a victor is issuing commands to the utterly vanquished. But we were influenced neither by fear nor by necessity ; it should baknown that Ottoman patriotism and amour-propre could not bear such a thing. According to the ' Times,' the Bagdad Railway question affects English interests in two ways : (1) the protection of British commercial interests in the points through which the line passes^ (2) the maintenance of British pre-eminence in the Persian Gulf. 1 his means that is Avhat the English want. If they prevent the line from going to Koweit. and take up a not. very friendly attitude towards us, will they gain what t^ey want ? If we fail to persuade the German company to hand over the Bagdad- Bussorah section to an international company and we have it made by the German company, what will British commerce gain ? It is known that she would gain nothing But is it so diihcult to estimate what she woidd lose? If the railway, instead of terminating at Koweit, ends at some other point on the sea, will no harm be done to England s preferential position m the Gulf ?

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Note communicated to Sublime Forte by Sir G. Lowthcr. HIS Britannic Majesty's Embassy lost no time in forwarding to His Majesty's Government the memorandum handed to His Majesty's Ambassador by his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1st March, 1911, containing certain proposals regarding the completion of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf Railway. These proposals will receive the careful consideration of His Majesty's Government, and a reply will be sent in due course. In the meantime, His Majesty's Embassy desires, under instructions from its Government, to call attention to the fact that paragraph 2 of the memorandum referred to, which deals with one of the conditions of the assent of His Majesty's Government to the increase of the customs duties by 4 per cent., gives a statement of the conditions laid down by His Majesty's Government which does not correspond w r ith those which have at various times been explained to the Sublime Porte. The point of view always maintained by His Majesty's Government has been that they would be unable to consent to the proposed increase for a fixed period if such increase were to be devoted, by setting free other affected revenues, to facilitating the prolongation of a railway which could not but have a prejudicial effect upon long established British commercial interests in Mesopotamia. These views were clearly set forth in a conversation which his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs had with His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London on the 19th May last, and on the 20th July they were again explained at the Foreign Office to his Highness the Ottoman Ambassador in London, who was on that occasion accompanied by his Excellency the Minister of Finance. Subsequently these views w 7 ere set forth at greater length in a memorandum which was placed in the hands of his Excellency the Minister of Finance when his Excellency was in London. The Sublime Porte will doubtless also remember that His Majesty's Government, in the course of the pourparlers regarding the question of consenting to the additional imposition of the 4 per cent,, expressed the desire, in the interests of the internal development of Egypt, that the Ottoman Government should arrange to remove the restrictions on the borrowing powers of the Government of His Highness the Khedive imposed by the Imperial firman of the 7th August, 1879 (19th Chaban, 1296), and thus revert to the financial status quo ante of Egypt as indicated by the Imperial firman of the 25th September, 1872 (22nd Redjeb, 1289), and that of the 8th June, 1873 (13th Habi-Akher, 1290).

WITH reference to my despatch No. 154 oi the 10th instant, 1 have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a leading article from the ' Tanin ' of to-day's date, which discusses the relations between Turkey, Germany, and Great Britain in a somewhat more moderate tone than has recently been the case. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the u Tanin ' of March 11, 1911. (Translation.) Turkey, England, and Germany. IT seems likely that the article in which the semi-official German paper, the ' Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, 1 ' says that, as Turkey and the Bagdad Railway Company are bound by a contract neither of the parties can discuss the subject with a third party on its own initiative, will give rise to discussion, and the ' Times 1 article which we reproduce to-day may be taken as the preliminary. It is natural that the Ottomans, as the most interested party, should watch this discussion with great attention. We admit that it is rather strange that a matter affecting our country should be the subject of discussion and dispute between two foreign Governments. Yet we must be thankful for the blessings conferred on us by the constitutional regime, which enables us to interfere as much as we do in the matter and to raise our voices on the subject; for under the old regime, this matter, like all those affecting Turkey's very life, would have been arranged without our knowledge, and doubtless to our disadvantage. The existence of an Ottoman Govern ment conscious of its interests and rights and resolved to defend them naturally directs the discussion into another channel. It can never be a cause of satisfaction to us that the Bagdad Railway question should cause rivalry and hostility between England and Germany. Without attributing that fact to any lofty feeling of humanity or desire for peace, we can say that we deprecate dissension between these two Powers because we should doubtless be the greatest sufferers. Turkey's duty is therefore to prevent the shock of^ contact between two opposing interests in the Persian Gulf, and that is why we maintained that we ought to come to an understanding with England and considered this discussion to be advantageous. • i r&gt; • It is satisfactory to the statesmen of neither country, we believe, that a 1 ersian Gulf question which is opposed to the friendly relations existing between England and Turkey should always exist in a vague and threatening form. Whenever Irak is referred to a number of embarrassing questions come up. Why should we not consider these doubtful joints in friendly discussion and try to find some means of removing them ? When we hear England talk about English commercial interests and rights in the Persian Gulf we are naturally displeased and anxious, not knowing clearly what the material and real form of these interests is or will be. It was clearly necessary to have an exchange of views in order to avoid even greater misunderstandings. ^ The statements in the German paper referred to above contain nothing that would prevent an Anglo-Turkish discussion of the Persian Gulf questions, and we do not think the German Minister for Foreign Affairs has such an idea. We make this explanation because the ' Times ' shows overmuch suspicion. Nevertheless, it _ must be admitted that just as it is right and legitimate for England and Turkey to discuss [1932 w—1]2 any questions they like connected with cither Ox Bagdad Railway or the Persian Gulf, to it is right and legitimate tor Germany to demand d.at the exislmg nghts o Germans should not lv prejudiced by such a discussion On dial point we admH that the German paper h right, for- Turkey is bound to the Bagdad Railway Company by an agreement, the conditions of which cannot lie changed by i urkey as a result ot discussion with another Government. U is, f course, necessary to isk for the views and obtain the consent of the company holding the concession. The Ottoman Government continues the discussion with England, finds out what the English claims consist of, and decides what i re be done if some of them are admitted to be legitimate and to deserve a hearin \ ll the mea -ures to be f akeTi prejudice the rights of the Bagdad Railway C'ompaey tlif Government o.t course obtains the company's consent; but if there is no point affecting the company it is obvious that no one has a right to object. From the desire evinced to continue this discussion, we understand that Turkey s wish to enter into negotiations with England is received with satisfaction m 'Jiat country. This may be taken as showing how advantageous it is to take up art enterprising line in our foreign policy. In order to solve political diiTu ultic c i naturally better to take up a definite line and try t( prevent difficult es rat her bun o wait until matters become a ' question.'' In our foreign policy in general, and in the Persian Gulf question in particular, our interest lies not in setting rivals by the cars, but in uniting them as far as is compatible with Turkish interests, and it is naturally better for us to think out means to this end and to prepare them.[Tliis Doonr . ;iit is oae 'ropert s cf His Britaanie Majesty's GoTennoeotJ EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

Pera, March 22, 1911. i r ix J tiL appeared j^esterday in the local press an official communique, which I enclose herewith, of a conversation between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and M, Boppe, the French charge d'affaires, on the subject of the arrangement which has been arrived at with the Bagdad Railway Company. His Excellency declared that the arrangement was a purely economical one, and Turkey would now be able to appeal to foreign capital for the Bagdad-Bussorah (sic) branch. He informed M. Boppe that the Ottoman Government were anxious to see the negotiations which had begun with I ranee for increasing the railway system in this county terminate satisfactorily, and expressed the hope generally that the financial interests of France here should cover a larger field. The £&lt; Tanin,' the mouthpiece of the Minister of Finance, to-day enlarges upon this subject, pointing out that the declaration in question should remove any bad humour^ or suspicion that might exist in France over the signature of the new conventions, Turkey being specially anxious to see French capital interested to an extent even greater than hitherto in the economic development of this country. The negotiations to this end, the article states, are at present connected with the Samsoun- Sivas-Erzeroum and Trebizond-Van lines—the two lines to be constructed in Albania and the line to the Bulgarian frontier. These lines will cover some 3,500 kilom. It adds that, as the Ottoman Government is bound under its engagements to construct these lines itself, a loan will be required, and an exchange of views as to the construction and working of the lines becomes necessary, and even expresses the hope that the negotiations may be concluded so expeditiously as to admit of Parliament being able to sanction them before the end of the session. Finally, the article says that whether the French will conclude these arrangements with or without the financial assistance of Great Britain is a matter which concerns Great Britain and France more than the Ottoman Government, but, in view of the entente existing between the two countries, Turkey would only regard such co-operation with satisfaction.

According the Concession Law, which was the outcome of the 'affaire Lynch,' all concessionPf involving a financial liability on the part of the Treasury must be submitted to the Chamber, and it is certainly straining the interpretation of the preamble of the 1908 convention to maintain that the reallocation of the revenues assigned to the Haidar • This table is inaccurate; see corrected one in Sir G.

I understand that my German colleague, Baron Marschall, is proceeding to Berlin in a few days, and that he intends impressing on Herr Kiderlen-Waechter the desirability of Germany unofficially approaching England, with a view to a friendly solution. On the other hand, the present Turkish Cabinet feel that the Potsdam interview, where matters Turkish were discussed without previously consulting the Ottoman Government, was a severe blow to the latter, and they are anxious at least to appear to come* to a settlement of Persian Gulf matters with England direct. At the same time, the proviso that in the event of the failure to form the new 'international Bagdad-Gulf company, the German company should be reinstated in her rights under the original concession, would seem to point to Germany's desire to be prepared for all eventualities, e.f/., the breakdown of the Anglo-Turkish negotiations on the subject. It is said that one of Germany's main objectives in all these negotiations is to obtain free access to the Pans money market. On general grounds it would seem that the removal of the mam causes of nvalrv and friction between Germany and England and France here, if not in a wider sphere, would be to the benefit of all parties concerned.

The attitude of Germany during these negotiations will be curious to watch. She apparently has something to gain by a settlement, and therefore may urge moderation on the Turks. On the othei hand, it might be unwise to confide in her until she comes out into the open, as it is always possible she is up to double-dealing. Mr. Mallet to see, A. P Foreign Office, March 27, 1911. It seems to me important steadily to keep in mind the main object we have in view, namely, the safeguarding of British interests in the Persian Gulf and, subsidifl .rily, in Mesopotamia, It was because we considered those interests threatened by the germain monopolistic railway scheme that we have declined to assist Turkey, or Gexman financiers, in carrying out that scheme. Our attitude has resulted in impressing Furkey with the necessity of obtaining from Germany a freer hand in regard to the Bagdad—Gulf section of the railway, so that Turkey now has something to offer to us, in return for which we are expected to consent to increase of customs and to allow British money to be made available for the railway. It is the customs, and our hold over Koweit, which have been the lever by which we are beginning to secure some success. This lever is available as against Turkey, and it is from Turkey that we want a satisfactory arrangement respecting the position at Koweit and generally on the littoral of the Gulf. Therefore we should do well to continue negotiating with Turkey. It is true that we are also desirous of coming to an understanding with Germany, but this seems to me, at this stage, not the primary, but the secondary, consideration. It is probably more important to us to get a favourable settlement of the Gulf question in genera! than to agree about the exact proportion of British participation in the railway. It is moreover only too likely, because in accordance with our long experience of German diplomacy, that if we were to agree to negotiate with Germany direct, she would after driving the hardest possible bargain with us, finally turn round to the Turks and, by some systematic misrepresentation such as their inspired organs are masters of, get Turkey to believe that it was England that was contemptuous of Turkish interests. If we do not get satisfaction out of the Turks as regards our position in the Gulf, we shall gain practically nothing by any agreement with Germany. On the other hand, a direct negotiation with. Germany might bear no direct fruit, and yet we might still come to a satisfactory arrangement with Turkey. Everything therefore points to the wisdom of negotiating direct with Turkey in the first instance and as the most important part of any attempt to carry out our policy. Any negotiation which we may carry on simultaneously with Germany ought to be clearly explained to be subject to the reservation that it can lead to no agreement unless we at the same time obtain satisfactory terms from Turkey.

Berlin, March 24, 1911. . 1 ^ e l0n0U1 ' t 0 enclose herewith a translation of the account given in the semi-omcial Nordueutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ' of the agTeements recently concluded between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company, lliis communique has been received with the greatest satisfaction by the rest of the German press, and all the most important newspapers have jubilant articles on the subject. The c Kreuz-Zeitung' says that the agreements have given equal satisfaction in Germany and lurkey. It passes lightly over the advantages gained by Germany in obtaining the concession for the building of the Alexandretta-Osmanieh branch line, and gives greater prominence to the benefits accruing to Turkey by the renunciation by the Bagdad Railway Company of so manv of its rights. It particularly points out that the renunciation of its claim to the proceeds of the contemplated 4 per cent, customs increase has simplified matters for Turkey, and will prevent the consent of other Powers to that increase being used as a lever to extract unwilling concessions from her, or to exercise pressure on the Sublime Porte. It appears from this observation that, in the opinion of the ' Kreuz-Zeitung' at all events, the release by the company of the proceeds of the 4 per cent, increase entails the removal of all opposition to that increase on the part of other Governments. 1 he article goes on to say that by the present agreements Turkey has gained greater freedom of action, and has in any case gained time, so that she can approach any international negotiations, directly or indirectly, connected with the Bagdad Railway question at her leisure, and without any fear of being hurried or forced into decisions with regard to the recognition or non-recognition of ' rights,' such as those put forward by England as regards Koweit. ' Neither,' it adds, ' will the German concessionnaires be under any necessity of coming to any immediate decision with regard to any concessions which may be demanded by other Powers interested.' The article then turns more particularly to the question of the southern section of the Bagdad Railway, and in that connection it sounds a note of warning. It says that while the postponement of international difficulties as regards the railway up to Bagdad may be regarded with satisfaction, the postponement of the difficulties regarding the Gulf section of the line is another matter, and entails upon the German Government the exercise of the greatest circumspection and vigilance. It was true that in renouncing its right to construct this section the company had stipulated that the German share in the new company to be formed should not be less than the share of any other non-Ottoman Power. The French press had objected that this renunciation on the part of the company was illusory, as the Germans and the Turks could always outvote the French and the English. This was, however, no certainty, and it might easily happen that, if German capital was only assured a share equal to that of other Powers, circumstances might arise in which an Anglo-French combination might gain the upper hand. 'We must therefore,' it continues, 'not shut our eyes to the danger that the influence of German capital may become illusory, that England from the south may get the deciding influence over the Bagdad Railway, and the Suez Canal drama be played over again. In this way England is seeking real and lasting advantages, both political and commercial. Germany, on the other hand, politically disinterested, seeks only to maintain the principle of the open door, and, far from having any idea or intention to set up permanent preferential tariffs, will be content with the temporary advantage of supplying the material for the construction of the line. To give up permanent advantages and acquired rights for such a transiton advantage would be a very short-sighted policy. Consequently, a word of warning to the German companies interested would not be out of season, and they should be advised to be very careful in their future negotiations not to make concessions disproportionate to the transitory advantages which it is desired to obtain by them.'

AS has already been announced elsewhere, various agreements were concluded yesterday at Constantinople between the Turkish Government and the German Bagdad Company to ensure the completion of the construction of the line as far as Bagdad. ~ The object of these treaties is to place the construction, which was already ensured by the original concession, on such a financial basis that its completion within a few years can be guaranteed by the company.

Cambon informed us that the French Government wished to secure certain railway concessions in the north of Asia Minor, which were being applied for by a Russo-French group. They wished to complete the system of Syrian railways ; and, as for a part of its length the Hedjaz Railway competed with one of the French railways, they wished this length of the Hedjaz Railway to be conceded to the French, Further, there was the Danube-Adriatic Railway project, in which they were interested. 1 said that I assumed that, if they were satisfied on these points, they would then be prepared to give their consent to the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs dues, and to consider that an agreement had been come to about the Bagdad Railway generally. M. Cambon assented, but said that the consent of the French to the increase would be dependent upon an accord having been come to with us. I told him that our situation was a corresponding one. We wished to have a satisfactory arrangement about the Bagdad-Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway that would secure for us two things. The first thing was that British trade should be sure of perfectly fair treatment on the whole of the Bagdad Railway system. We could secure this if we had control of the Bagdad-Gulf section, for the arrangement of through- rates would then be a matter in which we should have oar say. The second thing we wished to make sure was that the strategic position in the Persian Gulf should not be altered to our disadvantage. We did not wish to press that the Bagdad Railway should be continued to the Persian Gulf, but we wished to secure that, if it did reach the Gulf, it should do so at a place and under conditions such that the present strategic position would not be prejudiced. I should discuss these two points with the India Office, which was specially interested in the strategic conditions, and with the Board of Trade, which was interested in the commercial conditions. I should then make a counter-proposal in reply to the Turkish proposals, which would certainly nob do as they stood. But, as the Germans could upset any arrangement which was come to with the Turks, I thought we should probably tell the Germans frankly what were the things which Ave wished to secure, and find out whether they were willing to agree to conditions by which they could be secured. If we found that an agreement could be reached, I should tell M. Cambon what the agreement was to be ; and T should say to the Turks that we would not conclude it and give our assent to the customs increase until the French Government also were satisfied on the conditions which he had indicated to me.

SECRET SERIES. [i1396j No. 1. Sir H, Babington Smith to Sir A. Nicolson.—(Received March 28.) Dear Sir Arthur, Constantinople, March 16, 1911. I HAVE not troubled you with letters since my return to Constantinople, in the first place because 1 know how busy you are, and in the second place because 1 have kept the Ambassador fully informed of anything that has come to my knowledge, and have also written to Cassel, who I knew was seeing you from time to time. 1 have had some conversation both with the Grand Vizier and with Djavid Bey on the subject of the Bagdad Railway. I understood from both of them that the partici pations suggested were not intended as final. When I told Djavid that 1 was sure that their proposals on this point would be unacceptable, he said that it would be possible to modify them by increasing the share for each country from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent., or even more, but that the Germans, he thought, would not be willing to accept any arrangement which would give them a smaller share than any other country. He added that he already noticed a stiffening in the German attitude, in consequence of Sir Edward Grey's full recognition of the rights of the existing concessionnaires. I replied that he was hard to please if he complained of Sir Edward Grey's speech, since the statements made were precisely similar to those made by the Grand Vizier in the Turkish Chamber a few days before, and added that Sir Edward Grey had to reckon, not only with Germany, but with opinion in England, which had hitherto refused to recognise accomplished facts. As regards the participations, 1 am inclined to think that our interests would be sufficiently protected if we had 40 per cent., as against 20 per cent, each for Germany, France, and Turkey. This would give us a majority in combination with any one of the other three parties, and would also give us a claim to the chairmanship. If our object is to make this the minimum of our demands, no doubt we should begin by asking for something more, say, 50 per cent. In the debate in the House of Commons a great point was made of the possibility of preferential rates, to the detriment of British commerce. This is valuable as an argument, but I am inclined to think that its practical importance is often exaggerated. In a customs tariff preferences may no doubt be given in the manner suggested by Mr. Balfour ; for instance, cotton yarn of particular counts, or cotton goods of particular categories, may be taxed at a lower rate. It would hardly be possible to apply such fine distinctions in the case of railway tariffs; for instance, on the Anatolian Railway, all fabrics, whether cotton, woollen, or linen, are treated together, and are in the same class, with a large number of other articles. The great bulk of the Mesopotamian trade is in cotton goods ; and I cannot believe that it would be practicable to manipulate railway rates for cotton goods in such a way as to favour German competition with our existing trade- Even if minute distinctions between different kinds of cotton goods were possible, it is evident that any new competitor would, in the first instance, at any rate, be obliged to compete by sending goods similar to those which at present hold the market. 1 am not aware that there is any authenticated instance in which the Anatolian Railway discriminates, directly or indirectly, in favour of German goods. I am very glad to see that the tone of the English press is, on the whole, more reasonable and more conciliatory than it lias been m the past, but, even under the most favourable conditions, discussions in the press are likely to prejudice the negotiations. I venture to suggest that the longei the negotiations List the less the prospect of success, and that as rapid a rate of {progress as is possible is a matter of real importance. n t Conversations have taken place between Bompard, the Ottoman bank, and the Turkish Government regard'^g a large railway loan. I do not think that the discussion has got so far as has been alleged in the newspapers. The idea, I think, on both sides is to find a means of reopening the 1 rench market; and it is thought that a loan to be applied expressly to public works would give the necesbaiy excuse to the French for relaxing their conditions. As regards the lines on which the monej' would [1932 ee—l] [March 28.] Section 1.be spent the Samsoun-Sivas line has been suggested, with prolongations U. Ereerouin ami Van!

IN continuation of my despatch No. 183, Confidential, of yesterday's date, I have the honour to transmit the text of the declaration made by the Bagdad Railway Company renouncing its rights conditionally to the Bagdad Gulf section and the ports of Bussorah and the terminus. This was handed to me to-day by Rifaat Pasha, with the assurance that, though not verbatim, it was practically the text, and that there was nothing beyond this. His Excellency, in reply to my enquiry as to a rumour to the effect that the Turkish Government had undertaken to keep the German Government fully informed as to the course of the negotiations with the British Government, declared that there was no truth whatever in the statement. No renouncement of the right to build the port of Bagdad, provided lor by article 22 of the convention of 1903, appears to have been made on the present occasion, and Rifaat Pasha did not know whether it had been the subject of negotiation. With regard to the annual sum to be paid by the Turkish Government to the railway company for the construction and working of the Halif-Bagdad section, 1 enclosed a table, in my despatch already referred to, showing that the amount would be about £ T. 400,000, while the surplus receipts assigned by the Government should yield about £ T. 405,000. This calculation was, however, based on the returns for one year (1910-11), and I have now had a further calculation made, taking the average results of tithe revenue surpluses for five years, without allowing for almost certain increase, which works out at considerably less in favour of the Government, for, as you will see from the enclosed memorandum, instead of there being a slight surplus, there is an apparent insufficiency of £ T. 208,000. This may have some academic interest. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Declaration by Bagdad Railway Company.

The German trace which crosses the Euphrates at El Badj and proceeds thence via Kerbela, following the right bank of that river. This route is the shortest and cheapest. It will carry the Kerbela and Nejef pilgrim traffic ; it is, however, not well placed for serving the area to be irrigated. 2. A line which follows the right bank of the Tigris as far as Kut-el-Amara, and proceeds thence along the line of the Hai River, at which point it crosses the Euphrates and then follows the German trace. This route would run on the embankment which Willcocks proposed, and is a little more expensive if constructed after the irrigation works have been carried out, while if constructed before these works it will be necessary to make a bank for the railway. There would result a substantial, though not prohibitive, cost. It would, however, as regards the irrigated area, be better placed as no large river intervenes. It would be at a considerable distance from the regions which will benefit by the Hindi6 barrage, as these lie nearer to the Euphrates river. A supplementary system of light railways would probably be required in order properly to serve the area ultimately to be irrigated in both cases. As Willcocks's plans are frequently changing. Sir Henry Babington Smith finds it difficult to give any decided opinion, but the fact that the German trace is independent of the precise nature of the irrigation schemes is, in his eyes, a great advantage.EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

I SEND you, by Sir E. Grey's desire, a copy of a memorandum, prepared after our conference on the 30th March, setting forth the conditions on which His Majesty's Government might agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties from 1 ] per cent, to 15 per cent, for a limited period. Sir E. Grey feels that whether the terminus is at Kovvcit or at Bussorah, it would be inexpedient for His Majesty's Government to agree to the customs increase unless the status of Koweit had first been agreed upon by us and the Turks. If we are sure of maintaining British control at Koweit. then prima facie it would seem advantageous that thp terminus should be there, and if such control is to be secured there are serious drawbacks to admitting German participation, as it would involve the presence of German officials at Koweit, and would give Germany a voice in the concern of the Gulf. The port would, however, be administered in the interests of the railway and of international trade. If we cannot secure control of Koweit, then we must reconsider our attitude towards British participation in the railway, with its terminus at Bussorah, but in any case, as stated above, we could not assent to the customs increase or favour such participation unless the status of Koweit had first been regularised. There is an article by LovatEraser in the April number of the 'National Review^, contending that it is to our interest, on strategic grounds, that the terminus should be at Bussorah, and not at Koweit. Sir E. Grey is inclined to think that if we had real control at Koweit we could prevent the establishment of a naval arsenal there if it should ever be attempted, and that we could in any case render such an arsenal useless by barring the entrance to the Gulf (see report by the interdepartmental committee which sat here in the autumn of 1907), but he proposes to consult the Admiralty and the War Office on the point. With regard to the collection of customs at Koweit, Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn the views of the Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

The idea underlying his remarks is to suggest that His Majesty's Government and the Opposition do not see eye to eye on the questions at issue, and that, while the former are inclined to advocate the settlement desired by Turkey, the latter are inclined to take up a less friendly standpoint in the matter. He denies that an increase in Turkey's strength in the Persian Gulf regions would endanger British political interests, and goes out of his way to point out the ' obvious error ' in thinking that Turkey is likely to have any designs on India. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHEli Enciosure in No. 1. Extract f rom the ' Tanin ' of March 28, 1911. T he ' Times ' A rticle. (Translation.) IN passing judgment on statements in the 'Times,' one must always remember that that newspaper holds political views opposed to those of the British Cabinet. The ' Times ' supports the Conservative leaders, such as Lord Curzon and Lord Lansdowne, on the Bagdad Railway question, and blames the Liberal Government for not acting with sufficient firmness and severity. What angers the ' Times' most is that criticism should be directed against the rejection of the proposal made to England in 1903. At that time the Conservatives were in office. The Germans invited British capitalists to take part in the Bagdad Railway construction; but the proposal was rejected by the Conservative party, on the ground that the line would be opposed to British interests. In this there was also the idea that the Germans would be unable to accomplish the task unaided. Lord Morley's statement that the apprehensions of 1903 were unjustified moves the ' Times,' the Conservative organ, to reply, and to defend the Conservative statesmen. Our object in giving this explanation is to prevent the views of the ' Times ' from being accepted as the point of view of the whole of England. In a recent article the 'Times' said that the British Government was to blame for not preventing the encroachment made by Ottoman troops on part of Koweit territory and urged the Cabinet actually to interfere in case of need. The difference between the 'Times'' violent language and Sir E. Grey's refusal to accept the expression ' right of protection over Koweit' will doubtless not escape the attention of Ottoman public opinion. . „ . It is clear that no change has taken place in the (Conservative point of view since 1903 ; it is clear that the Bagdad Railway is still regarded by them with an eye of displeasure. The ' Times' says so openly ; it argues that this railway is a source of danger to England and that it offers her no advantage. In our opinion the Bagdad-Bussorah line can never constitute a danger to Eno-land. Since—as the ' Times ' admits—she has no intention of seizing territory in the^ Persian Gulf or Irak, an increase in the strength of Turkey in those regions can never endanger British political interests. We are convinced that they themselves do not seriously believe that an increase in Turkey's strength in the Persian Gulf would constitute a menace to India. To think it likely that we have designs on India an to [1969 c—2]r 2 put that forward as a serious consideration is an obvious error; therefore an increase in Turkey's strength in Irak can never be a menace to British political interests. As to British commercial interests: will British trade profit more it the Bagdad Railway is built without the participation of British capitalists ^ Had it been impossible to construct the Bagdad-Bussorah line without England's consent, it would have been reasonable to propose onerous conditions; but as the line can be built and taken to an undisputed harbour on the Persian Gulf, whether British capital participates or not, England's interest, if she wishes to safeguard her rights there, is to participate in the construction and take a share in the line. How mistaken the 'Times'' point of view is, is proved by such statements as this ; 'We should have liked to do a service to two friendly nations; but we cannot do so without knowing what advantage we are to gain.' Now neither Turkey nor Germany ever asked for a service or a favour. Out of consideration for England's great commercial interests, we applied to her to show that we did not wish to harm those interests, and to prove that it was a very precious hope with us to maintain friendly relations with her; we made explanations to clear away England's doubts and apprehensions, and desired to know her point of view. It must not be forgotten that the door of negotiation has been opened, and that during the course of discussion no words should be spoken, no demands made, which e oundm^ to ^the amour-propre. The friendly attitude and conciliatory policy taken up by the English Cabinet is a source of satisfaction. As the Liberal Cabinet lias before it the real state of the question, we can see no point favourable to British interests m the 'Times'' criticisms of the Cabinet. We hope the 'Times' realises that the Bagdad Railway question, is not the Koweit question nor the question of the 4 per cent, customs increase.TMs Docum ent is the Property ^ ffi^ Britannic Majesty's Goveru nenil EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

' The passage off the extreme of the Has is about 5 miles wide, and is clear of all dangers Anchorage with good shelter for small vessels of 16 feet draught may be found close inside the westward of Has Tanura, the holding ground here being reported as very good ; large vessels would have to anchor off the extreme of the Eas, where the depths are sufficient, but the holding ground is bad. The westward anchorage is used by Turkish Government vessels visiting A1 Katif, and a coal depot is maintained by the Turks near it. The general approach to Ras Tanura from seaward appears to be free from dangers so far as the existing surveys show. As the meaning of the word 'Tanura' is ' whirlpool,' it may be assumed that strong tides exist in this vicinity. A1 Katif, which is an important coast town, lies west-south-west at a distance of 10 miles from Ras Tanura. The town can only be reached by boats drawing 6 or 7 feet, the principal approach being from the southward. It is situated in an oasis of the same name, which extends 9 miles north and the same distance south of the town, and its depth from the coast inland is, on the average, 3 miles. The oasis is bounded on the north and west by a large desert tract. As a port A1 Katif serves only the oasis on which it stands. The principal exports are dates to Bahrein, and most of the imports are ^f Indian origin. A Turkish garrison is stationed here, which in 1908 consisted of a detachment of fifty infantry. The climate of the oasis is damp and unhealthy, and malaria is prevalent. The total settled population of the A1 Katif oasis was estimated in 1908 at 26,000, of which number 10,000 belonged to the town of A1 Katif and its suburbs. It would take a very large expenditure to make a harbour suitable for a railway terminus at Ras Tanura, and also to render the place more healthy. I am, &amp;c. W, GRAHAM GREENE.

Board of Trade to Foreign Ofice.—(Received ( April 8.) (Secret.) . , • - - ' r * ai ' B 0a vd of Trade, April 7, 1911. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to advert to your letter of the t6th March, and enclosures, with regard to participation m tlie Bagdad Railway and' other matters, and to the Board's re£ly of the 22nd March, and also to a letter, dated the 29th March, from the India Office to the foreign (Mfice, of which the BoaiXi' have heen favoured with a copy. With reference to the main question addressed to them by the Foreign Office, viz., what steps could be devised to ensure equality of treatment for British commerce if a system of internationaiisation were arranged for the Gulf sections of the Bagdad Railway such as would not allow of preponderating control in capital and on the railway board to this country, I am now directed to inform you that the whole matter of the s£eps necessary to secure British trade from adverse discrimination on the railways of Asiatic Turkey has received the very careful attention of the Board. As a result, they have caused to he prepared the enclosed rough heads of two forms of agreement having the proposed object in view, and applicable respectively to the two cases in which Great Britain has or has not control to the extent of at least 50 per cent, of the southern section of the railway. It will be observed that the form and contents of the two draft heads of agreement differ fundamentally. In the first case supposed, the desired object could probably be attained without serious difficulty by an agreement as to the con ditions of through traffic between the new railway company, the Bagdad Railway Company, and perhaps the Anatolian Company. This aim would be materially facilitated if, in addition, one or two British directors were admitted to the boards of one or both of the last-named companies. The draft heads of such an agreement are enclosed (marked (A) ). In the second case supposed (which is the case assumed for the purpose of Sir Edward Grey s question), the Board consider that nothing short of a formal treaty between Great Britain and Turkey would be of any use, and as we should, ex hypothesi, have no controlling power on either of the boards of management to prevent dis crimination, the only means of enforcing the treaty would be diplomatic pressure at Constantinople backed possibly by a threat of withdrawing consent (if given) to the 4 per cent, increase of customs duties. In the opinion of the Board of Trade, the articles of such a treaty, in order to be effective and to prevent evasion, would have to be drawn in a form not less stringent than those contained in the draft enclosed herewith (marked (B) ). They cannot, how ever, conceal from themselves that insistence on such drastic conditions would be likely to hamper the ordinary commercial development of railway enterprise in Asiatic Turkey, and that it would be difficult to justify them from the point of view of British railway practice. On the other hand, diplomatic pressure at Constantinople, with its inevitable delays and uncertainty, does not appear to the Board to be a satisfactory mode of preventing or remedying, as they arise, cases of alleged differentiation, cloaked as they usually would be under various forms of adverse classification, delay of traffic, or other indirect methods of discrimination, without the adoption of a nominally differential tariff. For the above and other reasons, the Board cannot recommend this course, which does not appear to them to give to British trade any satisfactory recompense for our consent to the increase of Turkish customs duties ; while, on the other hand, if such consent were refused, we should be deprived of any effective lever to secure attention to our representations to the Turkish Government. Such study of this question as the Board have been able to make from a purely railway, commercial, and financial point oQview has led them to the conclusion that there are only two practicable policies :— [1969 h—i] BI 1.

The Board of Trade, as at present advised, are strongly opposed to the adoption of this policy, if it can be avoided. They are not directly concerned as a department with its probable effect upon the political relations between this country, Germany, and Turkey, but it appears to them that it is not unlikely that its adoption might lead to a Turkish boycott of British ships and commerce, which would react chiefly upon the trade of the United Kingdom, and would cause grave dissatisfaction in commercial quarters. It is even within the bounds of possibility that we might have to Face the repudiation by Turkey of her obligations as regards customs duties under the Capitula tions, and the unilateral enforcement of the 4 per cent, increase without our consent. If such an extreme step should be taken and receive the support of Germany, and if it could be plausibly represented that it had been directly caused by our unreasonable refusal to consent to a measure required, by the financial circumstances of Turkey, the Board do not see what effective means of resisting it would be open to us, and in that event our control over the rates of Turkish customs duties would be gone for ever. The Board of Trade therefore submit, for Sir Edward Grey's consideration, the desirability of taking some such steps as the following ;— 1. An immediate confidential conference with the authorities of the National Bank of Turkey (or of any other financial institution through which Sir Edward Grey may contemplate working) to ascertain definitely whether, if desired, they would be disposed to take up the matter on lines satisfactory to His Majesty's Government both as to the security of British control of the capital and as to the financial arrangements to be made between the new company and the Turkish Government. In this matter the Board of Trade will be glad to give any assistance that may be desired. 2. A confidential conference with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway, to ascertain if that company would be prepared, subject to Turkish consent, to co-operate in a scheme on the basis of forming a new company for the southern section, financed equally by that company and the National Bank of Turkey, subject to a satisfactory working agreement among the railway companies for through traffic, the admission of one or two British directors on the boards of the existing railways, and (if thought necessary) a separate arrangement for the construction and control of the terminal harbour on the Persian Gulf. confe^-enteslstnown. 0 Turk,sh note on line8 to ^ deci(1 ed when the result of these two 1 am &amp;c.

CAMBOIS having' told Sir Arthur Nicolson that Count Benckendorff had spoken to him of the desire of Russia to participate in the railway from Bagdad to the Gulf, in order to show that the good understanding between England, France, and Russia had not been upset by the Potsdam negotiations, 1 took an opportunity of discussing the matter informally with M. Cambon to-day. Sir Arthur Nicolson being also present. 1 observed to M. Cambon that I appreciated the good political intentions of the Russian Government, and the value of what they wished to demonstrate. On the other hand, the Russian suggestion would complicate the negotiations exceedingly. Supposing that France was to have a 20 per cent, share in the Bagdad—Gulf section, Russia 20 per cent., and England 20 per cent., and that, in addition, France was to have what she desired with regard to the Syrian railways, part of the Hedjaz Railway, railways in the north of Asia Minor, and the Danube—Adriatic Railway, while Russia had the abnegation of German projects in the Russian sphere in Persia, in such circumstances British public opinion would say that, as France and Russia had these things in addition to a share in the Bagdad - Gulf section equal to ours, we should also get something in addition. My idea was, therefore, that we should not participate in the advantages which France and Russia were to get elsewhere, and that they should not participate in the Bagdad—Gulf section, but allow us to make the best bargain we could with regard to this. We have hitherto asked a share of at least 50 per cent., and if we got this the rest of the section must, I supposed, go to Germany under the German arrangement with Turkey. M. Cambon said he entirely understood our difficulty. He had told Count Benckendorff that the question as to whether France should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section was one which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to do so, but she did not regard it as her affair. He was impressed by the desire of the Russian Government to retrieve the blunder which they had made at Potsdam, and he took the same view as I did of their political intentions in the matter^ but it was very difficult for them to undo what they had done at Potsdam. He had also pointed out to Count Benckendorff that the consent of Turkey was necessary to Russian participation. I observed that 1 had warned Count Beckendorff from the beginning that, while M Sazonow should reduce as much as possible the difficulties in which he had become entangled at Potsdam, he should not break off the agreement made there with Germany^ because the Khanikin Tehran branch and the other inconveniences in the arrangement were not serious enough to justify a political quarrel between Russia and Germany, which would suit neither Russia nor England, and which 1 assumed would not suit France either. M, Cambon asked whether he might tell Count Benckendorff, who was not instructed to make any proposal formally, that I would talk over the matter with him. I replied that I would do so next week ; but I hoped that M. Cambon would explain the difficulties to him, as I should have to point them out to him when he came. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

[13720] No. 1. / at , r \ ^' r Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (No. 105.) ^ I ASKED Count Benckendorff to-day what with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. He told me that, since Germany had renounced the Bagdad—Gulf section and the matter no longer appeared, to be one between England and Germany alone, the Russian to\ ernment thought that it would be a good demonstration of the co-operation a trois if t if,} j as well as France, participated in tne Bagdad—Gulf section. Co-operation a trois had lather diopped out of sight, and the Russian Government would like to see it re-established. I entirely agreed with this, but i explained to Count Benckendorff our difficulty with regard to the Bagdad—Gulf section. As a matter ,of fact, Germany had not i enounced this section ; she had stipulated for a participation in it as great as that of anj other x^ower except lurkey, and the German concessionnaires had reserved the right to claim an indemnity for loss of profit on kilometric guarantees. I also told Count Benckendorff that we had not yet sent in our reply to the proposals which the iurkish Government had made to us. W hen we did replv, we should certainly point out that the position which they now put before us was quite different *o that which Djavid Bey had suggested last summer as a possible way of meeting our views. I)javid Bey had then asked us whether we thought that a settle ment could be reached if Turkey had a free hand with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section. W e had replied that this might provide a basis for a settlement, provided that, if the participation of foreign capital was invited, our participation was in pro portion to our trade ; this would give us about 60 per cent. In any case, it would be difficult to reconcile British public opinion to a bargain unless we had at least 50 per cent. But, in the new circumstances created by the German agreement with Turkey, if we had 50 per cent., Germany was also to have 50 per cent., Turkey would drop out oi linancial participation, and the question would still be one to be discussed between us and Germany. France, I understood from M. Cambon, wished to secure railway advantages in regions quite different from that of the Bagdad Railway ; and she would participate in the latter railway only if we desired her to do so, for she did not look upcn it as her affair. My view was that Russia should make her bargain as she had begun to do at Potsdam. France should make her own stipulations with regard to the matters in which she was most interested. We ourselves should make the best terms we could about the Bagdad-Gulf section. Then, when we were all three ready, we would simultaneously agree to the increase of the Turkish customs dues. Simultaneous agreement of this sort would have an excellent effect. Count Benckendorff said that the fact that Germany had not unconditionally renounced the Bagdad-Gulf section made a considerable difference. He thought the Russian proposal was founded on the assumption that Germany was out of the question. The Russian desire was to help us, and therefore their proposal would not hold if the question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, that if it was ultimately decided to have French co-operation, Russia should come in too, for the participation of Russia as well as France, entailing the division of the railway section into five shares instead of four, might just turn the balance in our favour. I agreed that if France came in it would be desirable that Russia should come in also, and if the negotiations took a turn in this direction I would bear the point in mind. Meanwhile, I thought it better to leave the question open, and I promised to let Count Benckendorff know how the negotiations progressed. It might be that, as a result of the terms which Germany had made with Turkey, the negotiations would revert to an attempt on our part to arrange a settlement with Germany and Turkey alone as the only way in which to get the large share in the Gulf section which British public opinion expected.

As pointed out before, the title of ' Pasha' which has been given to General von der Goltz, Lord Kitchener, and numbers of others does not necessarily imply Ottoman nationality or subjection, while though Sheikh Mubarek bore the title of kaimakam, or governor of a kaza, the Ottoman Government has never exercised authority in Koweit territory through military, police, customs or other officers, nor has it prevented the sheikh from contravening its laws and carrying on war with neighbouring Ottoman tribes, e.g., the Muntefik. The refusal of Sheikh Mubarek, mentioned by Abd-ul-W ahab, to obey the summons to proceed to Bussorah, Bagdad, or Constantinople, rather goes to prove that he was really independent. 1 would add that the suggestion contained in the India Office letter of the 3rd March, 1911, concerning Koweit would seem to be on the lines of granting to the sheikh's territory a status similar to that granted to Egypt by Imperial firman. 1 have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. (Translation.) Extract from the ' Tanin ' of April 10, 1911. Koweit in the Past, the Present, and the Future. IN view of the fact that Koweit may be considered as the kev to Irak, and even to the whole of Mesopotamia, it is natural that the question should occupy the world's attention. The 'Times' and other English papers, while differing in various details, are united on some fundamental points. According to their claim, Koweit has been independent ah antiquo, and the English have an interest in Koweit. On hearing of this claim we were greatly astonished, for up to the present time the Kaimakam of Koweit, Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha, has never separated himself in any way from his Ottoman nationality. Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha is an Ottoman and the son of an Ottoman ; that point is fully established by entries in official registers and by documents signed by his own hand. Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pusha has not hesitated to show his obedience and submission to the Government, both secretly and openly, and to keep his Ottoman nationality in its entirety. His predecessors—his brothers Sheikh Muhammad Pasha and Sheikh Abdullah Pasha, their father Sheikh Sabah, and their uncle Sheikh Jabir—admitted their Ottoman nationality with the greatest pride and loyalty. This admission, this bond, is very important for us; for the tie is our chief weapon in a time of conflict. Reference to official entries in registers proves clearly that Koweit is regarded as a dependency of Bussorah, as Bussorah is a mutessarifate under the vilayet of Bagdad. All the documents kept in the vilayets of Bussorah and Bagdad, am [1969 s—l]particularly those from the Graud V oLdient Koweit is connected with Bn^orah ^ ^ p asha) the foVder of liberty, to the Empire.

Even when Lord Curzon. Governor-General ot India, pa^ a ^ lslt , . 1 Persian Gulf and was received by Mubarek -es-Sabah Pasha as one o. tn ^ ' 1 ^ Gulf, he saw that the Ottoman flag waved over Mubarek -es-Sabah . asha s house o\e^ his private ships and his ships of commerce, and in other places, and realised hs connection with and loyalty to the Ottoman Empire ; and when he asked him - Do you still use this flao-?' Sheikh Mubarek Pasha replied, 'Yes ; I use this flag. Our present position with regard to the country to which I owe allegiance is like that existing between a father and son who are angry with each other. Some day the father will be pleased with his son, and every difference will be cleared up.^ These are the exact words that came from the lips of Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha. Undoubtedly, such words can come from a sincere and zealous man who finds prosperity and happiness under Ottoman dominion, and they can only be expected from such a man. Such loyal and sincere words are equivalent to saying, ' I desire from my heart and ray tongue that the great Moslem Caliphate may be exalted and that Ottoman unity may be kept irom harm.' But these are not the only words, the sole acts and circumstances, that show Mubarek-es-Sabah's loyalty and sincerity towards the Ottoman Empire. His acts and his words also show the bond that unites him to ' Ottomanism ' and reveal his devotion and obedience to the Empire. The sheikh, like everyone else, knows that the everlasting Ottoman Empire is the sole place of recourse for all Moslems and their crown of pride, and that to be faithful and loyal to that everlasting Empire is a sacred duty which comes before everything else. About nine months ago some meetings took place in my house between the late Vali of Bussorah, Suleiman Nazif Bey, Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha, the ruler of Mohammerah, Sheikh Khaz'al Khan, and all the notables of the vilayet. This was a step towards clearing up misunderstandings and exchanging (marks of) friendship and amity On that occasion I said a few words suitable to the time and place. During the course of the sittings which took place in my house 1 said, ' Koweit is subject to the Empire.' The sheikh, far from objecting to this, received my words with the greatest joy and satisfaction. He promised that he would again accept the payments which he had abandoned for some time past owing to the maladministration, the dishonesty, and the abuses of certain officials. Moreover, he undertook to build a post office for the Ottoman postal service at his own expense ; and raised no objection to his a^reeino to similar useful works The 'Times' claim about 'salary paid by Turkey to Sheikh Mubarek Pasha for the defence of Bussorah ' shows that it is not conversant with the facts. Turkey is not so unable to defend and protect her territory, thank Heaven ! on this point 0 ni6anS by the P a y ment of salaries.

All the Government did was to send a ship to tell Sheikh Mubarek Pasha to go to Bussorah or Bagdad or to Constantinople to be appointed to the Council of State. Mubarek Pasha did not accept this proposal, which was necessitated by the policy of the old regime; for it was not easy for a man like him to leave his country and bis people and go to Constantinople. How could he expose himself to such a danger ? At that moment England backed up the sheikh, and said she would protect him. Whatever the question may be, T say openly that the maintenance of the policy and intiueiice of the Empire in Koweit depends on appointing honest officials who will provide the good administration which Midhat Pasha declared to be necessary for the Sabah tribe. I am convinced and confident of Mubarek Pasha's loyalty and friendship towards the Empire. His sole aim is to assure his future and that of his sons and descendants ; which entails Koweit being in their hands and their being the sheikhs so long as one member of the Sabah tribe remains. The European papers distort this fact ; one rarely meets in them news with regard to our country which is not distorted. News concerning us is published after being cut according to the greedy aims of the Governments of the countries to which those papers belong and the telegraph agencies work on the same principle and policy.

[April 21, J section 1. 12979 No. 1 Foreign Office to Admiralty * ^ ir » , ^ ^ Foreign Office, April 2i, 1911. [HE Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are aware that an agreement has recently been concluded between the Ottoman (rovernment and the Bagdad Railway ( ompany whereby the latter renounce, under certain conditions, their right to construct and work the section which is to connect Bagdad with the Persian Gulf as well as to construct the port at Bussorah or on the Gulf in favour of a new Ottoman company to be formed for these purposes, and that negotiations are at present in progress between His Majesty's Government and the Ottoman Government to settle the question of British participation in the building and control of tins section. It is stipulated that the German share in the new company shall be equal to that of any other foreign Power participating. The Ottoman Government have already communicated to His Majesty's Govern ment proposals as to the nature and extent of this participation, and the reply which is to be returned to them is now in course of preparation. One of the most important questions for settlement in connection with the subject is that of the terminus of the line on or near the Persian Gulf. This question involves important considerations of a political, commercial, and strategic nature, and it is in regard to these last that I am directed by Secretary vSir E. Grey to request an expression of their Lordships' opinion. It is necessary in this connection to decide whether His Majesty's Government shall make it one of the conditions of British participation that the terminus of the line shall be at Koweit (with the port under British control), and refuse to participate unless this stipulation is accepted, or whether it would be more to the interests of this country if the terminus were at Bussorah. As their Lordships are aware, Great Britain occupies a privileged position at Koweit, holds a lease of the foreshore, and has incurred special obligations towards the local ruler in virtue of agreements hitherto kept secret. The advantages of prolonging the line to Koweit are very great, as it affords the best natural harbour at the Gulf which large vessels can enter, whereas access to Bussorah is impeded by the bars, and would require a large initial expenditure to keep it clear. If British capital participates in the railway these are important considerations from an economic point of view, whilst the fact of the terminus being in the territory of a sheikh bound to Great Britain and on land leased by His Majesty's Government would, it is thought, largely compensate for the disadvantages inherent in a strategic line to the Persian Gulf. It might further be stipulated that the harbour should never be fortified if, in the opinion of the Lords Commissioners, this stipulation would be of advantage. The attitude of the sheikh cannot altogether be ignored, and it is thought he would certainly welcome the advent of this line to his territory, and might possibly resent it if His Majesty's Government stepped in to prevent it. On the other hand, it has been argued that certain disadvantages would attend the creation of a port at Koweit, which would then become the terminus of a great inter national line ; that it would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to retain any effective control over the port, and that the tendency would be tow r ards greater interference by Turkey, whereas if the line terminated at Bussorah these difficulties would not arise. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured with their Lordships' opinions on the point at an early date. Also to Director of Military Operations, mutatis mutandis. [1969 x—j]EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

Grey to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant relative to the question of British participation in the construction and control of the southern section of the Bagdad Railway. As regards the question whether the selection of Koweit as the terminus of the line should be made an essential condition of such participation, I am to state that Sir E. Grey is at present in consultation with the Admiralty and with the Director of Military Operations as to the strategic aspect of the proposal, and, till he is in possession of their views, can pronounce no decided opinion on this point. As regards the proposal contained in your letter that it should immediately be arranged to hold confidential conferences with the authorities of the National Bank of Turkey and the Bagdad Railway Company, I am to state that Sir E. Grey would deprecate any communication with these for the present, and considers that the reply of His Majesty's Government and the recent proposals of the Ottoman Government should first be agreed on and drawn up, and that it should be communicated direct to the German Government. Sir E. Grey prefers not to discuss, for the time being, what should be the policy of His Majesty's Government in the event of their not being able to obtain the 50 per cent, share of control in the southern section of the line which it is proposed to demand, but he concurs in the view that the acquisition of this proportion should be made a condition of consent to participate in the first instance.

Neratow replied that all that he could tell me on the subject was that nothing whatever had passed between the two Governments since M. Sazonow had handed Count Pourtales the revised text of the draft agreement. He did not know whether this silence on the part of the German Government was to be accounted for by their desire to wait till M. Sazonow was sufficiently recovered to be able to resume the conduct of the negotiations which he had initiated or to some other cause. He personally, was inclined to believe that they desired to see what would be the outcome of the negotiations which His Majesty's Government were conducting at &lt; onstantinople on the subject of the Bagdad Railway before replying to the last Russian proposals. M. Neral nv then proceeded to speak to me on the subject of your conversation with i 'ount Benckendorff, ol which you communicated to me the substance in your nespatch No. 11)5 ol toe lOtu instant. His lliXcellency said that he thought it most important that the solidarity of the ' Triple Entente ' in the matter of the Bagdad Railway should be manifested to the world, and that he had therefore suggested that Russia, as well as France, should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section. He understood from what you had told Count Benckendorff that there might be difficulties in the way of the internationalisation of this section ; but, if this proved to be the case, the object which he had in view might be attained by an amorcellement of the line. I enquired whether he meant by this that the Bagdad-Gulf section should be divided into different tronQons, as that would in my opinion be very difficult to arrange. His Excellency admitted this, and said that it would be sufficient if each of the three Powers acquired an interest in one or other of the different parts of the Bagdad Railway system. Thus were Great Britain to obtain the control of the Gulf section, Russia might be given the Sadidjeh-Khanikin branch, while France'might take over some other section. I said that 1 believed that France's aspirations were fixed on railways in another direction, and that, moreover, 1 did not quite see where she was to come in, unless it was on the Bagdad-Gulf section, M. Neratow thereupon suggested the branch line to Alexandretta, but I pointed out that this was an arrangement to which Germany was never likely to consent. 1 gather from the above conversation that M. Neratow desires to revert to M. Sazonow's original idea of claiming for Russia the right to construct the Sadidjeh- Khanikin line in the event of Great Britain obtaining satisfaction with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section (see my despatch No. 482 of the 9th December last). I have, &amp;c. george w. buchanan. [1969 aa~l |[This Document is the Prsoerty of His Brit aiuiic Majesty's Go v cmmcnt ■ EASTERN DEPARTMENT. SECRET SERIES. [15137] No. 1. Sir G.

THE Novoe Vremya' H 'aSv. publisKed two leading articles on the latest develop ments of the Bagdad .Railway question, in which it refers with great bitterness to the meetings at Potsdam. The first of these articles, published on the 12th April, deals with the concession to Germany of a port at Alexandretta and the right to connect that port with the Bagdad Railway. Germany, the article says, obtains thus at one stroke her first naval base in the Mediterranean and a free road for her trade into Persia and India. This is indeed a triumph for German diplomacy, and it is to be attributed directly to Russia's abandonment at Potsdam of her opposition to the Bagdad Railway scheme. The article goes on to say that a representative of the paper called at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to enquire about the Alexandretta concession, and was informed by an official of the Ministry that this concession had no connection whatsoever with the Potsdam conversations, and that Turkey, being a free country, had full liberty to grant what concessions she desired. From this view the writer of the article begs to differ. As long as Russia persisted in her negative attitude towards the Bagdad Railway scheme, Germany could not find the means to construct the railway even as far as Bagdad. Now all that is changed, and Germany acquires a naval base on the Mediterranean and a road for her commerce into the heart of Persia, where Russian commerce formerly reigned supreme. The writer contemptuously dismisses the theory that the Russian representatives at Potsdam had no right to discuss the question of Turkey's granting concessions in her own territory. It is clear enough, he says, that a formal concession by the Ottoman Government was not considered sufficient by Germany for the realisation of the Bagdad Railway scheme. Germany had to obtain Russia's consent as well, and Russia gave it without obtaining any corresponding advantage. A line from the Bosphorus to Bagdad is of no great political importance to Russia, but it is far otherwise with a line from a naval base on the Mediterranean into the heart of Asia, and at Potsdam Russia missed^ her opportunity of striking a bargain. The article closes with a bitter criticism of Russian diplomatic methods, saying that her representatives always exhibit an absurd respect for international jurisprudence, and an equally absurd disregard of political expediency. ' What Russia needs is a little less of politics in her jurisprudence and a little less of jurisprudence in her politics.' The second article, published on the 13th April, deals more especially with rumours as to the course of the Russo-German negotiations. The writer says that the delay in putting the results of the Potsdam meetings on paper is variously ascribed to M. Sazonow's illness, to unforeseen difficulties, or to the discovery by M. Kokovtzoff that Russia has not enough funds at her disposal to construct the Tehran—Khanikin line and that Germanv has in consequence agreed to find the necessary capital heiself. The writer inclines to the belief that the delay emanates from Berlin, and that Germany, in direct contradistinction to the Russian practice, relies more on accomplished facts than on written documents, and is in no hurry to sign papers. A simple v erbal exchange of promises at Potsdam has lent wings to the Bagdad Railway Oompany, and made possible the immediate financing of the unconstructed section of the Bagdad line It has induced England to consent to the construction of the Gull section, and has made it possible for Germany to obtain a coaling station on the Mediterranean and to carry her commerce to Russia's Caucasian frontier, to Persia, to toe shores of the Persian Gulf, and beyond. . . TT n ^ The writer then sounds a warning note as to Austria -Hungary. Germany las renounced direct participation in Persian railway construction, but Austria-Hungary has not, and Austrian financiers may appear on the scene at any moment.

From the information which 1 receive, . Relieve that the trench financial interests might very easily be induced to take this view; but so long as the impression prevails that the British 'Government has no wish whatever to bring about such co-operation, I fear that they are not likely to move. I have telegraphed to Cassel, asking whether it is possible to persuade you to take a less negative attitude, and you may hear from him before this letter reaches you. We have^ recently made proposals to the Government regarding the ports of bamsoun and Irebizonde, and any other ports whose construction the Government may have in view. We have proposed to them that they should conclude with us a ' contract d etudes, with a view, of course, to entering into a definite contract for the construction and working o! the ports later on. 1 discussed the matter with the Grand Vizier yesteiday, and 1 found that he was very favourable to the idea, since, from the political point of view, he would like to see English interests, as well as French, established in that part of the world. He had, however, a little apprehension, lest the French should claim that the ports ought to form part of the railway scheme. The French have not made any mention of the ports in connection with this scheme; and 1 think lie felt that this being so, he was perfectly at liberty to enter into a contract with us, so far as the French were concerned ; but he said he would like to know that he would not be met with a veto from the British Government, as in the case of last year's loan. I told him that 1 did not conceive it possible that such a thing could happen in this case, but that 1 would take steps to obtain an assurance that there was no danger of such an obstacle arising. I therefore put the matter before you, and shall be glad if you will enable me' to say that if the Ottoman Government is ready to enter into a contract with us with regard to these ports, it will be a cause of nothing but satisfaction to the British Government. I have had several interviews with Mr. Spitzer regarding the fusion of the National Bank and the Bank of Salonica, and we have made some progress in the negotiation. This morning, however, he received a telegram from Paris saying that the attitude of the Ottoman Bank had become less favourable, and that the Ottoman Bank stated that they had received absolutely authentic information of recent date that the British Government took no interest whatever in the fusion of the two banks, and would view with indifference the disappearance of the National Bank. I cannot conceive how such an impression can have been produced; but you will readily understand that so long as it prevails it would be perfectly futile to pursue the negotiation, since it is not to be expected that either the French Government or the Ottoman Bank will facilitate the arrangement, if they believe that the National Bank is not supported by the British [1969 u—'ij. | „ t nn(V reported this to Sir Gerard Lowtber, who has telegraphed to (n.yermj.eut. l . j ^ sil . c^.,. , , 10pe that you ,nay find -t possi'bie to take 'steps which will at once, and effectually, remove the erroneous impressioii^n ^ ouce before the Lo;ldon committee of the Otton.an Bank entirely misrepresented the attitude of the Foreign Office, and 1 should be inclined to attribute the present misapprehension to the same source.

MANY thanks for your letter of the 13th on the subject of British participation m the proposed loan for the construction of railways in Turkey, of the construction by British capital of Turkish ports in the Black Sea and of Anglo-French financial co-operation in Turkey generally by the fusion of the National Bank with the Bank of Salonica, and by a subsequent arrangement between the fused banks and the Ottoman Bank. As regards the first point, all that I have told Sir E. Cassel has been that, so lono- as t he J ranco-Russian group (represented by M. de Lamornaix), which has the support of the Russian Government, occupied the field, we could not support any competing group desirous of constructing railways in the basin of the Black Sea. If, however, the present applicants (/'.c., M. de Lamornaix and his group) were to retire we would support any British syndicate which came to an understanding with the Russian Government who, as you know, in virtue of their agreement with the Turkish Government, occupy a privileged position with regard to railway construction in the northern provinces of Asia Minor supposing that Turkey does not wish to undertake it herself. We have no desire whatever to interfere with the proceedings of the National Bank, which is free to^ take what course it pleases to secure participation in the proposed loan, and there will be no question of our interposing against any transaction of this kind which the Grand Vizier may decide to effect with the National Bank, but we must remain judges of whether we can give it our support should that support be requested, taking into consideration the merits of each case as it arises. This seems to me to be a perfectly clear and logical position. As regards the second point, before we give an opinion on the project for the construction by British capital of the ports of Samsun and Trebizond, we should like to enquire the views of the Russian Government, as they are naturally interested from a strategic point of view in the question of Turkish ports in the Black Sea as we are interested in the question of ports in the Persian Gnlf, and we should not like to support any project in the Black Sea region which they would consider disadvantageous to their interests. If the National Bank sees no objection we could make such enquiries, but for us to act without enquiry would invite similar independent action by Russia in the Persian Gulf. As regards the third point, we have over and over again expressed our desire to see Anglo-French financial co -operation in Turkey an accomplished fact, and all reports to the contrary arc quite unfounded. It was only quite recently, as you know, that we telegraphed again to Sir G. Lowther on the subject. Yours sincerely, A. NICOLSON. [1969 dd—3] IEASTERN DEPARTMENT. SECRET SERIES. Q S ection ].

IN my telegram No. 90 of the L3th instant f informed you of the check oiven to the negotiations for the fusion of the National Bank and the Banque de SaloiSque by the news said to have reached the Imperial Ottoman Bank that His' Majesty's Govern ment took no interest in the matter. As I expected, your reply, conveyed in your telegram No. 102 of the 13th instant, showed that this assertion was baseless, a^nd the incident may be ascribed to its real cause, the jealousy ith winch the Ottoman Bank regards any encroachments on what' it considers its own financial preserves. As a further instance of the determination of the Ottoman Bank to shut out participation in those undertakings in this country in which it can acquire an interest I may cite an aii 'cie, evidently inspired by that institution, which appeared m a recent number of' La Gazette financiere ' under the name of the editor of that journal. The writer, commenting on an article in the ££ Tanin ' on the negotiations between the French and Ottoman Governments for the extension of the Turkish railway system, which suggested that perhaps French and British capital would co-operate in this enterprise—a fact which could only give satisfaction to Turkey—says that, though such co-operation may not be in principle impossible, yet England is solely preoccupied with the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf, and has never suggested that her nationals should have any share in the operations which are forming the subject of negotiations between France and Turkey. 1 he supposition of the ' Tanin' is therefore, in his opinion, gratuitous, so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, but not so as regards the wish of certain British capitalists to interest themselves in French enterprises. The ' Tanin,' he goes on to say, has very skilfully suggested the idea, and an effort will be made to let the Ottoman Government think that to reserve a share for British capital will be both advantageous to Turkey and agreeable to His Majesty's Government. The article continues :—- ' Le systeme des participations forcees a souvent reussi. Dans cette mdme question des chemins de fer projetes, le bruit n'a-t-il pas couru tout recemment d'une contre-proposition qui aurait ete faite par un autre groupe franca is ? lei il appartenait an Gouvernement franeais de faire observer la discipline aux capitalistes et aux financiers franyais, ' Quant a la question qui nous occupe aujourd'hui, faudrait-il encore que le Gouvernement britannique, puisqu'on fait etat de ses desirs, les eut manifestos.

' D'ailleurs, puisqu'en I'occurrence e'est avec le Gouvernement franyais que traite le Gouvernement ottoman, ne serait-il pas facile au Gouvernement anglais de proceder a un echange de vues avec le Gouvernement francais, sans qu'il y ait lieu pour les capitalistes qui pretendent a une participation, d'essayer d'agir a Constantinople ? Et cela d'autant plus, comme le dit excellemment le £ Tanine,' que c est une question qui ne concerne en somme qu'indirectement la Turquie que de savoir si aux capitaux franyais viendront on non s'adjoindre des capitaux anglais.

It therefore seems that a suitable scheme for the general development of the country can only be arrived at as the result of consultation and collaboration between the bodies charged with canal and railway construction respectively, A railway of some sort connecting Bagdad and Bussorah could no doubt be constructed without reference to the canals ; but such a railway would either be absurdly aligned,leaving the populous and cultivated parts of the country on one side of it, or it would be unnecessarily expensive from its having to contend, unassisted, with such difficulties arising from low levels, floods, and irrigation requirements as it might encounter. If, by any means, the experience of the Government of India's engineers in dealing with kindred problems could be drawn upon, the result would obviously be much to the advantage of the Turkish Government. The case seems to be one in which independent action by the canal and railway department might lead to inextricable engineering confusion and great financial waste. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, LC.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure (A). A ppendix R. ' IT became evident, early in the history of the Chenab Canal, that a railway for transport of produce was very urgently required. The requisition for this railway came from the railway department unexpectedly; it had not been contemplated in the programme of the time being, and some delay occurred before funds could be made available. It is scarcely too much to say that the success of the colonisation scheme was seriously threatened by the difficulty the settlers experienced in conveying their enormous produce to the market. This need has now been so fully recognised that in the case of the newly opened Jhelum Canal, a similar railway down the centre of the Jech Doab is being constructed, and a considerable portion of it will probably be open for traffic by the time an urgent need for it arrives. This is a quotation from the completion report of the Chenab ( anal in Northern India, a canal traversing lands similar to those of Mesopotamia in their climate and in the condition in which they found themselves before the canal works were carried out. Here is a description of the country from the original report: ' The country was one of extreme desolation ; the rainfall was only 5 inches per annum, and one might tiavel for miles without seeing a living thing. . . . I he distinctive feature of the landscape was the camel thorn. The only inhabitants of the country were the indigenous tribes known as the Janglis and their herds. The Janglis were a people of pastoral and nomadic habits, eking out a precarious existence by means of their camels and cattle. In such a land, so like .'-'Teat part of Mesopotamia, canals have introduced in a few years nearly a million of inhabitants, and the resurrection of the country has been so rapid that its very success has been jeopardised by a railway not being able to be made quickly enough to transport the enormous produce. . , , A life-long experience in India and Egypt has firmly impressed on me ^ e maxim that in the arid regions of the earth water should be monopolised for irrigation and railways for transport. You cannot leave the waters of the rivers in their channels lor purposes of navigation and at the same time take them out of their channels and irrigate the country with them. For navigation you may substitute railway tidnsport , foi purposes of irrigation nothing can take the place of water. * a 'i air irrmlh hp ahmirdlv aliened whicli, as in the German scheme, should ruu tinough the desert from nevct* im^sntworid routo ay iuy l bmiible estimation, was based on a different and fundamentally wrong notion.—J.

A copy of this letter was enclosed in the memorandum handed to the Otto man Min/ster of Finance on the 29th July 1910 ; and m the same memorandum, certain alternative proposals were placed before His Excellency . Sir E Grey is of opinion that His Majesty's Government cannot now recede from what they have already stated to the Ottoman Government, and that ob ner cent of capital and control would be the maxiTOwm share which they could now fairly claim, if the question were one of internationalisation under tne concession of 1903. From the terms of the written proposals of the Turkish Government, enclosed in Sir G. Lowther's despatch No. 139 of the 1st March (of which a copy_ is trans mitted herewith), it would appear that what is contemplated by the Sublime Porte is that the 1003 Convention, in so far as it applies to the sections in question, should be cancelled and that another arrangement should be substituted. It is, of course, clear that the consideration of these proposals must be largely dependent upon whether or not they have the concurrence of the German Government and, both from the failure of Sir G. Lowther to elicit any precise and definite information on the point, and from the semi-official statements,which have appeared in the G erman press, it would seem that such is not indeed the case. Be this as it may. Sir E, Grey is of opinion that the attitude of His Majesty's Government in regard to the proposals now made should be carefully considered in all its bearings, with a view to sending a reasoned reply to the Ottoman Government without undue delay. It is therefore essential to enquire whether, in the interests of British trade or on other grounds, a preponderating share of capital and control is a condition sine and non of British participation in the enterprise. If a settlement on the lines desired should prove attainable in regard to Kuwait, and if the 1903 concession is to be cancelled in so far as concerns the railway beyond Baghdad, and a formal in ternational agreement substituted (such agreement stipulating, inter alia, that differential tariffs are absolutely excluded, and that the whole management of the line shall be conducted on approved methods), is it indispensable that British con trol, either in share-capital or on the Board, should be preponderating ? Is it not possible that British control, in so far as concerns equality of treatment for British merchandise, could be rendered effective by stipulating in the contemplated in ternational agreement or bi-lateral contract, that British assent to the desired in crease in the customs is conditional upon the continued fulfilment of certain obli gations by Turkey, and that default on her part would, ipso facto, determine the pe riod of British assent to the enhanced customs tariff ? Even if His Majesty 's Gov ernment were to hesitate to exercise such a power, the knowledge that they pos sessed it would undoubtedly exercise a salutary effect; and, on the analogy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, agreed to for seven years in 1907, it might be provided that the 4 per cent increase should be levied for only a fixed period, when its conti nuance for a further period would depend upon whether or not the Ottoman Gov ernment had fulfilled all obligations as to the exclusion of manipulation of rates. If it is considered desirable that agreement should be reached as to British participation in the enterprise it is important not to forego such participation on inadequate grounds. Sir E. Grey does not desire to express a, final opinion as to the expediency of such participation until he has been further acquainted with the views of the Secretary of State for India and of the Board of Trade.But, in fhti meantime, I am to place before yon certain considerations in favoui of and against British participation in a degree which is not preponderating, the assumption in Doth contingencies being that satisfactory conditions on the lines indicated, can be reached in regard to Kuwait, and embodied in an agreement bet ween His Majesty's Government and Turkey. It may be urged that, in the absence of a definite agreement, conflicting in- terests of different nationalities in the Mesopotamian delta are likely to become more and not less acute as time goes on, that French financial interests are inclin ed to become restive at the prospect of French participation in the enterprise being postponed indefinitely ; that in any case the Baghdad Railway will ultimately be - completed; that the position of the Central Government in Turkey will then be con solidated and the Turkish power of agression against Kuwait correspondingly in creased ; that, if the Turkish Government are not now conciliated, the fulfilment' of British treaty obligations towards the Shaikh of Kuwait, will become more one rous and difficult, while the protection of the Shaikh's date plantations in Tur kish territory, whence he derives his principal revenue, will be a source of in creasing friction and annoyance ; and that British prestige would suffer, to the de triment of British commercial interests, if Great Britain had no share in the construction of, the sections of the railway between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it may be urged that it is perhaps to the advantage of Bri tish interests that the advent of the railway towards the Gulf should be postponed as long as possible; that the progress of the railway has hitherto been slow, and that much time may elapse before it reaches completion ; that without the additional safeguard of British co-operation in those ha If-civilised regions the bonds of the raiK way D company are not likely to find a ready market in the future any more than is believed to have been the case in the past; that, without British participation, the railway would probably stop at Basrah, thus eliminating questions of some com plexity as to jurisdiction and similar matters which might arise if the terminus were at Kuwait, where it would almost be necessary to institute a British Court with ju risdiction over foreigners; that, apart altogether from an arrangement to secure Bri tish participation in the railwav, the differences with Turkey in regard to Kuwait and the littoral of the Persian Gulf might be adjusted as a condition of British assent to the customs increase, and to the continuance of the 3 per cent, increase on its expirv in April 1914 : that, having regard to the general nature of British rights under the Capitulations, His Majesty&gt; Government could not improbably prevent the manipulation of tariff rates as against British trade, though this is a technical matter as to which the advice of the Board of Trade is being requested ; and that the lame volume of British trade (estimated at nearly one million sterling a year) which now passes into western Persia by way of Baghdad, might be diverted to a less circuitous route, and thereby be protected against adverse treatment, if a con cession were obtained for a railway from Khor Musa and Mohammerah to Khor- remmabacL Sir E Grey feels that the question of British participation in the Gulf sections of the Baghdad Railway without control is one which must be judged on its inents and apart from the general effect of non -participation on the international situation, l it were decided that, on the whole, it was not worth the while ot His Majesty s Government to encourage British capital to participate m the railway without con trol but that British opposition to the enterprise would be withdrawn when a sa- tiqfactorv arrangement had been concluded as to questions at issue between Great SEK t SS ? on the littoral of the ^ ^ then have cause of complaint m regard to the British attitude. tx ^l,„r hand it ia considered desirable that Great Britain should par ticipate! it will be necessary to decide tho ^bH ^fu to isriSKsrs .hi. v «Ma of His Majesty 's Government should have a seat on the Board. Sir E, Grey would be glad to have the views of the Secretary of State for Incua on these points. ^ C162 J?D\ The question of the kilometric guarantees is not alluded to in this letter S8 it can lell be reserved for subsequent consideration. ^ Qir F rrpv ,{ ? full concurrence in the importance 01 a« oidirg I am to express Mr E Grey s uu eon^^.^ ^ ^ used to our detn . ^ f^houTd^hrpresent negotiations with Turkey prove abortive ; and, for this hels anZXt the'reply to theTurkbh proposals shouid bo drawn up in close consultation with your Department. r, , i,..,, ,1,,, oubieot of Kuwait, I am to advert to the view expressei' by the Marquess of tansdowne, in his memorandum of the 21st March, ! 002 that the British obligation to protect could not be interpreted as extending beyond Kuwait • proper ' to the ' outskirts While Sir E. Grey is in agreement with the view that the Shaikh's claims to Warba and Bubiyan might be upheld if it ^ -'ally desirable to do so, bethinks that those claims could hardly be sustained with regatu' to Urn Kasr, and certainly not as far south as Musulamiya Bay. If the terminus of the railway is at Kuwait proper (Bandar Shweikh) the importance of Warba, I Bubiyan and IJm Kasr, is largely reduced. In any case, if an agreement with Tur- | key is reached it will be desirable to define precisely the limits of Kuwait territory ' in order to avoid future friction ; and 1 am to suggest that, with a view to expedi tion, it might be desirable for the Government of India to be consulted by tele graph in regard to those limits. With reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, 1 am to draw your attention to the desire expressed by the Ottoman Government to del ue the position of the two Powers in the Persian Gulf,—a desire which, if marked by sincerity, is clearly satisfactory. Finally, I am to express Sir E. Grey's opinion that it is extre-ne-y desirable, if only, for tactical reasons, to obtain a concession for a line from Khor ^ isa and Mohammareh to Khorremmabad, especially as the concession need not involve more than an option to construct.

Government of India. 2. Since your letter was written a Convention has been signed between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Company whereby the latter relinquishes its concession for the section between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf on the understanding that it receives in a new company to be formed a share not less than that of any other non-Turkish Power, and subject to a claim to be indemnified for loss arising out of construction expenses guaranteed on that section. The conclusion of this Convention no doubt facilitates the opening of negotiations between this country and Turkey. It also, in Viscount Morley's opinion, removes all inducements to open them. 3. When the written proposals of the Turkish Government were received it was understood that they were not final, but were of a tentative nature, and did not exclude the hope that more favourable terms might be obtained for this country. To any such hope the door is apparently closed by the new conven tion. It is not probable that in an international company to be formed for promo ting a railway on Turkish soil, Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed, and if that is so, unless France is to be practically excluded, it is arithmetically impossible for Great Britain to obtain more than 25 per cent. In 1909 the total trade of Baghdad was 2,918,120/, of which 1 ,954,000/ belonged to Great Britain and India, or about 67 per cent.; 237,379/ to France, or about 8 per cent; and 65,349/' to Germany, or less than 2j per cent. Comment on these figures is unnecessary, and Lord Morley believes that no Government that consent ed to permit the increased Customs duties in return for participation upon these terms, or upon any terms at all resembling them, could stand before the criticism that would be invoked. 4. This view,—in which there is, no doubt, an element of sentiment—is con firmed by an examination of the question on its merits as a matter of business. From this point of view I am to observe that, apart from providing profitable scope for British capital (which is not withouu scope elsewhere and is not likely to be attracted to an enterprise in which it will have to begin by paying an mdem- nitv to the original concessionnaires), the sole measure of the advantage of parti cipation is the control that it affords ; and the degree of control afforded by a 20 per cent, or even 25 per cent, share is illusory. Nor, on the other hand, does it appear that we stand to lose commercially by non-participation, since, if it is i47 possible to prevent the imposition of the op^e)3i r ley n^toscc^y the Mohanmerah- Khorremahad line, if we can secure it, tor the extenaon o. our tj^em ^ Persia-the more so as trade by the Baghdad route will, if the nu rtabed Uist &gt;m* duties are to be the price of British participation, in future be penalised to the extent of approximately.48,000/ a year. 5 It would appear, therefore, that no commercial advantage is to be antici- pated' from participation, and Lord Morley is of opinion that, when it is realised that it is no longer possible for the scctioD to be a predominantly Biitish under taking, that the British share in it is not likely to exceed at the outside l,000,000i and that for the privilege of lending this sum to an international company British trade is to be taxed between 30,000/ and 400,000/ a year, no desire to parti cipate in it will be found to exist in financial circles m this country. The conclu sion to which he is driven is that for the present it is desirable on commercial grounds to stand aloof. 6. Political considerations appear to point in the same direction. His Lord ship does not overlook the arguments stated in paragraph 10 ot your letter under reply. But these arguments centre round Kuwait, and it is precisely Kuwait which—if it is to be the terminus—Turkey cannot afford to give up on the only terms which we can afford to accept; for alike in the official Turkish proposals, and in the remarks of Djevad Bey reported in Sir E. Grey's Despatch to^ Sir F. Bertie, No. 20, of 14th instant, it is laid down that the terminus must be at a place under Turkish administration. While, therefore, Lord Morley, regards a solution of the Kuwait difficulty as worth the price of considerable concessions, provided that the conditions stated in my letter of 3rd March are secured, he is inclined to think that from the Turkish point of view such a solution is neces sarily inconsistent with the location of the terminus at that place. And if the terminus is to be elsewhere, Kuwait loses much of its importance, and the price proposed is far too great to pay. 7. Judging the question, therefore, as Sir E. Grey invites him to do ' on its merits, and apart from the general effect of non-participation on the inter national situation. Lord Morley holds that the balance inclines markedly to non- participation, and he concurs in the conclusions indicated in the last two sentences of Lord Hardinge's telegram. 8. It therefore appears to him that every effort should now be made to obtain the Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession, and that in the meantime the Turks should be informed in the friendliest terms that His Majesty's Govern ment are unable to accept their proposals regarding the railway, and that after careful examination of the situation (profoundly modified as it has been by the recent Convention), they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is not worth to them the price which they are asked to mv and as they do not require the extension in the interests of their own trade' they do not think it necessary to put forward counter proposals. The fact that the Company have relinquished their claim to the increased Customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude, since the refusal of His Maiesty's Government to consent to them will nn IfmoAr fi ^ s to the railway. Lord Morley would propose That Pi.

In order to obtain a channel ISO metres wide and 8 metres deep we should have to dredge 7,000,000 cubic metres of soft mud on a length oi 24 kilometres. These quantities seem very small for so important a work, and would justify the Government in undertaking a serious examination of the question, I cannot leave the question of the port of Basrah without mentioning the fact that a channel 32 kilometres long and 1'5 metres deep, along the ancient course oi the joint waters of the Euphrates and Tigris, would put the Euphrates in communication with the western head of the Khor Abdullah, and if a port were needed on this Khor, sweet water would be available far in excess of anything Port Said possesses. Similarly, by digging a cjiannel 10 kilometres long through the desert south of the Khor Abduilah-Bubian bifurcation, Euphrates water could be sent down the Bubian channel where it travelled thousands of years ago.

No. W- Isot sent to Foreign Office, Sent in duplicate* Sent to Government of India* Youk Excellency, With reference to my despatch No. 229-9 of the 20th March 1911, forwarding a rough estimate by the Indian Railway Board (upon certain data supplied to them) of the possible earnings of a Baghdad-Basrah railway,, I have the honour now to enclose copies of some papers with which Sir William Willcocks has favoured me, relating to railway construction in Mesopotamia. The first paper (Enclosure A) is the draft of an appendix which will accom pany a general report that Sir William is about to submit to the Turkish Govern ment on the subject of irrigation works in Mesopotamia. It shows, by means of cogent instances drawn from India, how desirable it is that irrigation development and railway construction should go hand in hand in this country ; and it concludes with the best forecast that Sir W illiam has been able to form—necessarily a very rough one of the amount of traffic in agricultural produce with which a Baghdad- Basrah Railway might be expected, ultimately, to have to deal The second paper (Enclosure B) is a map illustrating the possible interdepend- ence and mutual subservience of railways and irrigation work in Mesopotamia. suBDOsine the latter to be executed m accordance with projects which Sir William is now recommending to the Porte for adoption. I would respectfully suggest that if the map is reproduced, copies of it should be sent to the Government of India, to whom a copy of my present despatch is being sent, as weJ as to this Kesi- The third paper (Enclosure 0) is meant to elucidate the second, by indicating ' to what extent the cost of railway construction is unavoidably enhanced if the irrigation and railway requirements are kept separate. ' I have understood from Sir William Willcocks and some of his engineers m tW ffreat (possibly the greater) part of the country through which C Xahd!d-Basrah Railway would pass lies below the flood level of the Tigris and Fuphrates • that the line must, therefore, run' to a great extent, along embankments; I tw the most economical and onlv proper way of arranging this would be and ^ e , f the ma i n canals carry the railway line.

G. LORIMER, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad. To His Excellency the Eight Honourable Sir Gerard Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, , Constantinople.3 ENCLOSUBE A, A ppendix R. ' 14 became evident, early in the history of the Chenab Canal, that a rail- „ wa 7. r trans port of produce was very urgently required. The re- ^ quisition for this railway came from the railway department unex- pectedly, it had not been contemplated in the programme of the (.t being, and some delay occurred before funds could be made avail- ' able. It is scarcely too much to say that the success of the coloniza- ^ tion scheme was seriously threatened by the difficulty the settlers ' experienced in conveying their enormous produce to the market. ]'&lt; Tilis need iias now been 80 full 7 f eco gnized that in the case of the newly opened Jhelum Canal, a similar railway down the centre of the ^ JechDoab is being constructed and a considerable portion of it will S4 probably be open for traffic by the time an urgent need for it arrives.' This is a quotation from the completion report of the Chenab Canal in North ern India, a canal traversing lands similar to those of Mesopotamia in their climate and in the condition in which they found themselves before the canal works were carried out. Here is a description of the country from the original report: ' The ' country was one of extreme desolation ; the rainfall was only 5 inches per annum and one might travel for miles without seeing a living thing The ' distinctive feature of the landscape was the camel thorn. The only inhabitants of the country were the indigenous tribes known as the Janglis and their herds. ^ The Janglis were a people of pastoral and nomadic habits, ekeing out a precarious ' existence by means of their camels and cattle/' In such a land, so like great part of Mesopotamia, canals have introduced in a few years nearly a million of inhabitants, and the resurrection of the country has been so rapid that its very success has been jeopardized by a railway not being able to be made quickly enough to transport the enormouts produce. A lifelong experience in India and Egypt has firmly impressed on me the maxim that in the arid regions of the earth water should be monopolized for irriga tion and railways for transport. You cannot leave the waters of the rivers in their channels for purposes of navigation and at the same time take them out of their channels and irrigate the country with them. For navigation you may sub stitute railway transport; for purposes of irrigation nothing can take the place of water. In countries depending entirely on irrigation, the railways should f jllow the banks of the main canals and traverse the centre of the tracts they mean to serve.. Now the Baghdad Railway is a desert railway, and though it will put Baghdad in communication with East and West, it will not serve the irrigated parts of the delta of the two rivers. I therefore sho w on drawing No. 52 the different alignments of the railways which would serve the country we hope to irrigate. On the map itself are given the mam features of the different lines and the task of selecting the best line and estimating its cost may be left to railway engineers. I confine myself to a statement of the probable quantity of produce such a railway would have to transport. The area to be irrigated between Baghdad and Nasmyah will be 750,000 hectares, and if from this area we export so much as represents the rents calculated in paragraph 22 of this report we shall have to handle annually 375,000 tons of cereals and 1,250,000 cwt. of cotton. As the country is famous for its breed of animals, there will be a considerable movement of live-stock, but I have no idea o what this number will be. W. WILLCOCKS..ENCLOSURE C.

IN the course of a conversation which I had with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, T enquired whether the German Ambassador had, since his return from leave of absence, made any communication to the Russian Government on the subject of the Russo-German negotiations. M. Neratof replied that Count Pourtales had communicated to him certain observations which the German Government desired to make with regard to the revised text of the agreement, of which I had the honour to forward you a summary in my despatch No. 44, Secret, of the 21st February last. On my enquiring whether these observations were satisfactory, M. Neratof said that some of them were acceptable, but that others were not so ; and he then proceeded to say that the chief objection raised by the German Government concerned the substitution in article 2 of the term ' Konieh-Bagdad Railway 55 for that of ' Bagdad Railway,' which had been used in the original draft. Count Pourtales had contended that as arrangements had now been made for the construction and completion of the Konieh-Bagdad line within the next four or five years, it would not be of the least advantage to Germany were Russia to engage not to oppose the realisation of that line. Such an engagement must, if it was to carry any weight with the German Government, extend to the whole Bagdad Railway system, so as to include the Gulf section, whose construction had still to be provided for. M. Neratof had, on the other hand, argued that the Russian Government had always understood that the engagement in question merely concerned the railway as far as Bagdad, as the question in discussion between the two Governments was the linking up of the Bagdad and North Persian Railway systems by a line running from Sadijeh to Tehran via Khanikin. The Bagdad-Gulf section, he had asserted, had nothing whatever to do with this question, and had not entered into the purview of the negotiations. . J . M. Neratof informed me that he had not yet submitted the matter to the Council of Ministers, and that before coming to a final decision he would consult you through the Russian Ambassador in London. He was, in fact, only waiting for a safe opportunity to write to Count Benckendorff, as he was so anxious that the Germans should not suspect him of discussing the question with you that he preferred not to trust such a communication to a cypher telegram. He was afraid, 1 ;? wev ®y' ^ Government would insist on the retention of the original wording ag a a - } aid that if the Russian Government refused to yield on this point the whole negotiations would break down. This would mean that Germany would regain he. liberty of action in North Persia, and the first use which she would make ot be to obtain a concession for the Khanikin -Tehran line. ,. . - iii j I said that I knew that you were anxious that the present negotiation should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, but that at the same time ^ ^ prefer to see the words 'Konieh-Bagdad .Railway reman G^venment always understood from what M.

The point may be of considerable importance in connection with possible financial negotiations, and if your Excellency has any reason to believe that there may be a claim on account of working expenses, which seems highly improbable, as well as on account of construction, I should be glad if you would furnish me with early and precise information on the poiut.

As regards the precise nature of the compensation alHided to in the copy of the Bagdad Kailway Company's declaration, enclosed in my No. 213, Secret, of the 31st March, it is impossible to obtain accurate information. Turkish sources have apparently no definite ideas on the point until the matter is settled in conjunction with the Germans. M. II ugenin, the managing director of the Bagdad Railway, is reticent on the subject, but one of his subordinates has confidentially hinted, in the course of conversation with Mr. \\ eakley, that compensation might not necessarily be pecuniary (on, for exampie, the lines discussed by Sir E. Oassel and llerr von 0winner, vide former's letter of the 20th December, 1909, to Sir C. Hardinge), but might take the nature of some other concession. He further remarked that a line from Bagdad to Mohammerah would probably offer greater advantages than a railway terminating at Koweit, which, he said, allowed of no further extension. The inference may be that the Germans might prefer the line being built to Mohammerah, and that, as regards England, they may intend to seek to come to an arrangement with her concerning railways and enterprises in South Persia, in connec tion with present negotiations, somewhat on the lines discussed at Potsdam with Russia regarding North Persia. He added that from Mohammerah there were possibilities of further railway extension as compared to Koweit. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER, [May 1.] Section 2.

My dear Crowe, ^ . Koweit, April 21, 1911. I SUPPOSE you are interested in the Bagdad Railway terminus question. You know that we have always been considering this as ih* rmjy th^ Lit was possible for the railway to come down to . and that we held the trump cards in conse- quence, because the line couM^not fincl an exit on the Gulf without coming to a port over which we had control. Our whole policy has in fact been based on this assumption. I am afraid this is an entirely wrong assumption, and that the whole edifice erected on it is going to crumble about our heads like a house of cards. The result of the survey of the river mouth, which I have just got the Government of India to do, shows that we can pass as heavy draft ships into the river as we can send to this anchorage. The depth on the bar has doubled itself in the last few years, and with very little expenditure of money we could get sufficient water to make it navigable for ships drawing 25 or even 26 feet. The reason for this seems to be that one of the two channels which existed in former years has silted up and all the water now goes out at one channel, with the result that the scour has much increased and has cut out the bar. The Germans and the Turks are, I believe, quite alive to the possibilities that this opens up, because the former have been egging the latter on to turn us out of the river, where we have been maintaining the buoys and looking after the navigation vaut pis que mal. Now the effect of this is that there is no reason why Koweit should be chosen as the terminus of the railway, because the difficulties in the way of making it at Bussorah no longer exist. We may certainly force the railway to go to Koweit, but I do not think it will be to any good or lasting purpose. There will be a line from Zobair to Bussorah, and at Bussorah the goods are landed in a populous country and on the river, by which they can be distributed with ease. This applies particularly to goods going to or coming from Southern Persia which will all pass through Mohammerah. If they were to go to Koweit they would be landed in the desert, and in order to distribute them they would have to go by sea to the river, and thence by lighter, except, of course, such as were for ports in the Gulf. This would entail an extra handling of all goods entering or leaving Persia by Mohammerah, and it is not likely that the trader would take this route. We should thus find the official terminus of the railway at Koweit, en Vair, with no trade to speak of, the actual terminus being at Bussorah where all the trade would go to. But this part of the question is not so important as that of preventing the Turk from hampering the trade at Bussorah and in the river, particularly the Persian trade to Mohammerah and the oil trade of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. We have lost our privileged position in the river by not looking after the buoys and keeping the charts correct, and the only thing that we can do, at least so it seems to me, is to put it into the hands of a commission on the lines of the Danube Commission. We should put in Persia, Turkey, and ourselves only if we can, but this is unlikely, and we shall be forced to accept Germany and Russia as well. We must not waste time over it or our opportunity will slip away and we shall find ourselves in a worse position than we are in at present. Whatever happens to the railway we must put the navigation of the river on a safe footing. The Turk at the present moment is claiming all sorts of things and is going to put dues on our steamers very shortly. I do not know yet exactly what they are proposing to charge, but it is a sum which will bring the vali a good revenue which he will use for his own purposes, and not for the good of the trade or the river if he can help it.

[May 16.] S ection 4. [18570] No. 1. G- Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 16.) (No. 328.) ^ ir ' Constantinople, May 12, 1911. • 7, Ul ^™ ce letter of the 29th March ('Eastern Department: Secret Seiies [12465]), containing the conclusions of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India on the question of our participation in the international company to be formed for the construction of a railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf only reached me by the last messenger, but although somewhat belated, 1 venture to offer a few remarks both on those conclusions and on the reasons on which they are based. The statement in paragraph 3 that ' it is not probable that in an international company to be formed for promoting a railway on Turkish soil Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed ' appears to me to be open to criticism. The 'international' company is in reality an Ottoman company, created in virtue of an agreement with the Porte, and subject to Ottoman laws and police, and its operations are wholly within Ottoman territory. Turkey therefore does not depend for its control over the line on the percentage of its participation in the same way that we must do for the protection of our commerce against differential treatment, and indeed, from that point of view, Turkey need have no more concern to have a financial stake in the company than it has, for instance, in the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. In fact, the reasons for Turkey having a large or indeed any holding in the proposed company are more sentimental than anything else. Turkey moreover has no money to put into the railway; she would have to borrow the money abroad on rather onerous terms considering the present state of her finances, and it is probable that as a business transaction the Turkish Minister of Finance would prefer not to be obliged to raise a considerable sum, which for some years is bound to be unremnnerative. For these reasons I venture to think that it is by no means impossible to induce Turkey to agree to a very material reduction of the percentage of the capital of the 'international ' company. Again, as regards French participation, it appears to me that as we are leaving the field free to France in so many other parts of Turkey we may fairly expect that the French Government will defer to our wishes in regions where our interests are so greatly superior to hers. I am not quite sure of the meaning of the last part of paragraph 4, but if, as I suppose, it suggests that if we concede the 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties, British trade with Western Persia by the Bagdad route would be penalised to the extent of 48,000/. a year, as compared with the trade by the Mohammerah-Khorremabad route, I must point out that there is a misconception. Imports to Persia by Bagdad only pay the transit duty of 1 per cent., and this duty is not effected by the 4 per cent. increase of the import duties. .... 11 In paragraph 5 it is implied that the whole of the increased import duties would fall on British trade. The Turkish contention is that they will mostly be borne by the consumer and the argument is one which it is not easy for ihe Government ol a free-trade country like Great Britain to refute. , i i i • r In paragraphs 7 and 8 Lord Morley expresses the opinion that the balance inclines markedly to non-participation, and suggests that the Turks should be informed m xe friendliest terms that His Majesty's Government are unable to accept their proposa s regarding the railway, and that, after carefully examining the^ situation they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is^ not woi o lem the price which they are prepared to pay ; and as they do not require the extension m the interests of their own trade, they do not think it necessary to put forward counter proposals. The fact, his Lordship adds, that the German company have relinqmshed their claim to the increased customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude since the refusal of His Majesty's Government to con ? ent f *£ longer wear the appearance of hostility to the railway. In spite ot the danger ot makS o prophecies in this country, I will venture to make a forecast of the result of such^ communication on public opinion and on the Government here. Ihe press has ,-4] —Wn pnnstaiitlv used to-spread the belief that our main condition for the increase of that the proceeds should not he devoted to the Bagdad Railway—a view for which it must he confessed there is some little justification, m view of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 23rd September, 1 JO J, quoted ,JJ 1 10 Porte's notice of tie 10th April, and if, now that the German company has a^d to relinquish its claims to those revenues, we were to decline to agiee to t ic incu ase of' the duties we should infallibly be held to be guilty of a breach of faith. The Turkish need for new sources of revenue is moreover being telt daily more acutelv and to refuse them after our main requirements have m larkish eyes been fulfilled would provide a golden opportunity to the hostile press to proclaim ao-ainst the hollowness of British friendship, and we should be denounced as pursuing a faithless and dog-in-the-manger policy. The confidence even of our friends would be shaken and a satisfactory settlement of the railway question, as \\ei. a^ 01 the many Gulf questions would be rendered for more difficult. The probabilities are that negotiations would be entirely broken off, and that the Lin ks woukl cigam to ilio Germans to carry out the Bagdad Railway scheme in its original 'oim, and n is possible that we should see the Gulf sections completed very likely qmlo a^ ^ooij a&gt; ine Moh am mer ah-K hor r em a b a d line, on which .Lord -Vlorley re±ies to pioc-'f t ■ - ^ ! • i.-;icin trade. The Turkish railway would be built and managed, moreover, without our having any voice m it for the protection of our trade with Mesopotamia, a i iiHh' In - ^n is likely to attain important proportions as the country is developed by the n illcocks s irrigation schemes. Lord Morley also makes some remarks on the question in connection with onr relations with Germany, and on two of these 1 venture to say a few words from the local standpoint. His Lordship suggests that a friendly agreement with Germany is essential before a satisfactory settlement can be discussed with Turkey. V\ ith the recent example of the Potsdam negotiations before us he cannot lose sight of the iact that such a course might cause some irritation to Turkish susceptibilities. Germany also could scarcely hope to succeed in laying the onus on us as she attempted to do on Russia, and for that reason she would probably be averse from negotiating with us alone. The second point on which I wish to comment is the suggestion that the ostensible relinquishment by Germany of the concession for the Gulf section makes it easier for His Majesty's Government to refuse to facilitate the construction of that section, since the refusal can no longer be interpreted as an unfriendly act to Germany. Such an argument may perhaps serve in Berlin, but it would be useless to allay the irritation in Constantinople which would inevitably result from our refusal to consent to the 4 per cent, customs increase or to participate in the railway.

Sir, Foreign Office, May 18, 1911. I TOLD Count Metteruicli to-day that ve had not yet replied to the Turkish proposal about the Bagdad Railway. We could not accept it as it stood, but we should put forward another proposal, and w ■ were now waiting for information from the Government of India about the Persian Gulf. Our objects were two-fold : 1. To secure that in practical working, and not only on paper, there would be no differential treatment of British trade ; and 2. To make sure that the strategical position in the Persian Gulf would not be altered to our disadvantage. Count Metternich observed that, in the Bagdad Railway concession, equal treat ment was promised for all trade. I pointed out how treatment which was equal in theory might be differential in practice, by the placing of high rates on goods in which Ave were specially interested and low rates on goods in which Germany was specially interested. If we were to concede to Turkey an increase of customs duties, which directly or indirectly would facilitate the making of the Bagdad Railway, we must, by means of our participation in the southern end, get some position which would be a guarantee to public opinion here that there would be no differentiation in railway rates. I said that, in conversa tion with my colleagues, I had always stated that it was not the intention of Germany to differentiate, ancf that when, as sooner or later must be the case, her assent was asked to a final settlement of the Bagdad Railway question, she would be willing to meet us on this point. . ^ . .i n n Count Metternich assented, and confirmed the view that the German Government had no desire to secure differentiation as regards trade. 1 am, &amp;c.

(Confidential.) HTS Majesty's Government have not failed to give their careful attentipn to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last from the 01 torn an Go v eminent. These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that they cannot ^ be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii. ) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty's Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enterprise ; and, while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of Finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an arrangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, of the whole in regard to the Gulf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution,—and, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests in other sections of the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage of British shipping are borne in mind. Since the arrangement laid before Djavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty's Government, they jiaye received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman (rovernmeut with some surprise. ^ The Turkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole, and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. 1 he details _ot the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties j i i tue|ted. est^s Governme]it regret tliat t i iey are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an interaatioiial Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interest are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other lower including Turkey and in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the mternationa and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that shou t be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each countij suou 1,6 ' Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty's Government consider that ^Convention should be concluded by the ^ exclusion of differential rates on any railways m Asiatic lurkcy, a of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cognate niatteis , ^ te( j.

With Bahrein they have had direct rela ions s n _ 1 ' , relations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties lati g . _ - • . having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the fcla\e tra le , ■ „■■■■ •- , of the succession to the throne ; the protection oi the island against toreign aggression ; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs His Majesty's Government have, m vMimj of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years ; am their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce oi ali countries, ami of protecting the long-established interests of Pntish-Indian subjects. His Majesty's Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement \\hich might restrict or undermine the authority which they have exercised uiiinlcrni11etlK with such beneficent results; they conceive that any extension ol 1 urkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty ; ami they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between | the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Gover • W ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula of K! Katr | (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; and ihey consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source oi local I: friction. The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty's Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such ■' * proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware. His Majesty's Government have never admitted that Koweit is under 1 urkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence oi opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there a MGdus Vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty's Government conseiit- ing to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained from3 ) ' i seiidiiig troops to Koweit and respected the status guo there, they would not oceiipv that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade. His Majesty's Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and to rec ogn ise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kamiakam, provided in other respects the siatus quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh Ins concluded with the British Government is recognised ; provided the islands of W arba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit', and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage uf the Shat-el- Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have some difficulty in with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission ^\ould superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. m -in As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the .l urkish Govern ment, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; {h) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem m the Turkish Customs Duties. His Maiesty's Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railway this attitude they adhere; and while they consider ® gfjarsia sSxStfat ~ rights and ..i.re.i. to, ymg* 'SX ol . m do they feel that they could justify to British ^ cerit . of tlie which will affect British trade -amounting m ^ litic „f issii es in the StS?S '0 J** I-'''- * property in Bagdad. negotiation on these If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon -g t on the fe i sw —- -4 Powers , and they will not only consent, subject to tlie concurrence of other Powers and to' the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914.

As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above- mentioned memorandum.

Why the Baghdad railway has hung fire so long is because French and English capital have been withheld till the political situation has been so clarified as to establish confidence among prospective investors and reassure them in regard to the international stability of this great enterprise, which is the outcome of the energy, foresight, and deter mination of the German people. HOSPITALITY BY THE GILL. There was once a father who did not live south of the Tweed; and when his son was of age, by way of cele brating his majority, the fond parent handed him an envelope. The son opened it with a grateful and filial heart; there was a note inside. Yes, it was a note—a note of every farthing the son had cost his father, from the doctor's fees for bringing him into the world, to the cost of last night's supper to the tenantry. ' You are going into business,' said the father who did not live south of the Tweed, f and you are going to pay me back every penny of that amount.' So, having had the fatted calf, the son went forth to eat husks among the swine who do live south of the Tweed. And he didn't go home for Christmas. The Savoy was cheaper. Hospitality is defined by the useful Chambers, whose gentle precision is often illuminating when thrown into juxtaposition with current affairs, as ' friendly welcome and entertainment of guests.' A witty Irishman, who was being shown the fine suite of torture-chambers in Salzburg Castle, with their very complete equipment for encouraging confidential statements, remarked, ' H'm, every convenience for the reception of guests.' That was a generous view of hospitality; Chambers is matter- of-fact; the father who did not, etc., was expedient; but it has been left to Mr. Gill, K.C., to be romantic. Hospitality, according to his remarks last week, has nothing to do with welcome, and only so much concern with entertainment as rests in that word's applicability to food and drink. There is the heart of the matter at once, the simple, romantic, engaging truth. But, like all revelations, it carries heart-break in its train. To think that anyone should have paid Melba a couple of hundred pounds to sing a song at an evening party! To think of the money wasted on flowers, and bands, and polished floors; on marquees and awnings and new frocks, and all the paraphernalia of dances, including cotillon presents; to think that all these things are not hospitality at all, and that a person with a bad appetite may come to the most lavish entertainment, and be only sixpennyworth the better, because he or she has only had an ice or a cup of coffee 1 But the real misery lies in the wretched and criminal waste of time we have for so long been expending on the exercise of hospitality. We have frequently been kept from a pleasant engagement by the fact that guests were coming to the house. What folly! All that was necessary was to leave the table laid for them, with instructions to the servants to look after their bodily comfort, and to hand them at the end a receipted bill for the dinner, in order that they might understand the exact amount of honour done them. To extend a cordial welcome is merely a matter of expensive dishes; while a three-and-sixpenny meal would do for mere # acquaintances. Hospitality has been thought an art; Mr. Gill has shown us that it is a science, entirely worked, out by, the aid of weights and measures and the current prices at ix we aitj oo avoid tne suspicion of monetary gain 1 Is hospitality really chop for chop and tooth for tooth, with never eye for eye ? Is it all entertainment for Little Mary? Oh, Mr. Gill, give us a little larger measure! NOTES FKOM PAEIS. '/QUELLE vanite que la peinture?' cried Pascal. His words sometimes came home me as I went through Salons containing each a few thousand pictures. The picture exhibitions at the great clubs that go in for art patronage are not large enough to weary, and yet contain enough of paintings and are sufficiently extensive to afford scope for an interesting hunt for good things. At the one now on at the Rue Volney the general tone is one of well-bred correctness, free from all stiffness and affectation of ' respect ability.' A very unexpected novelty is a 'Venice' in nearly every tone of grey, here and there showing the opaline tints of a fine pearl. I know that there are grey days in that city, and very beautiful they can be. But no artist has been nonconformist enough to find in them his advantage before Pierre Waydmann. It needs, perhaps, a public of more cultivated taste to find exquisite pleasure in seeing a spectral city rising from the water which they are accustomed to view in the hues of a fulgurant sunset. Not that Venice clothed in red, yellow, bistrous brown, orange, and umbe'* with a blue sky above, is not a feast to the jsx , cultured eye. The portraits are, I dare say, faithful likenesses, and, when they will be no longer valuable as souvenirs, The Luxury of a Bath is incomplete without the addition of scbubb's Ammonia , which refreshes and invigorates.

I presume that we intend to make good,vis a vis the Porte, the original agreement, and it therefore seems to me that there is no more obligation to communicate the details of this than there is to give those of the unmaking which was exacted fr o« the American Hission. If on the other hand as the result of the negotiations with Turkey we have to modify the agreement of 1899, then the lease xf agreement ^between ^ourselves and taeand the Sheikh, would with stronger reason be affected by such a modification. 2hiB Mubarak would understand. If those details were to be comaunicated to the Turks at the beginning of the negotiations, and the latter proved in the end abortive, our position would be greatly prejudiced and an u opening for future controversy would be left.
