With reference to letter NO.F.136-N/33 dated the 2nd June, 1933, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of a letter No.415-23 dated the 2nd August, 1933, from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent, Bahrain, giving the pronunciation of the word 'Bahrain'.Copy of letter Wo.415-23 dated the End August, 1933, from the Adviser, Bahrain Government, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. I have the honour to acknowledge your letter No.821 dated July 17, 1933 with enclosures. The pronunciation of Bahrain or Bahrein by the Arabs of Bahrain is as RAIN which falls from Heaven; I think I am also correct in saying that this is the official Indian pronunciation and it is also the pronunciation used by the Persians and Indians resident in this country. Under no circumstances is it pronounced as in M aisle” Furthermore the recognised spelling of Bahrain as adopted by the government of the country, the Indian post office in Bahrain and all official departments is Bahrain . There is, as I expect the Permanent Committee on Geographical names is aware, a small uninhabited oasis south of the Siwa oasis in the Libyan desert, whose name is also 'Bahrain” and I think I am correct in stating that on most maps the name of this oasis is spelt Bahrain. The derivation of the name of the oasis is similar to the Bahrain islands as it owes its name to the existence of two salt lakes..1. 5001/34) P. 51910. 231.1.1.

Since then, however, (see P.Z.3496/37 - flag B in the lower file) the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names have produced a 'Second List of Names in Arabia (N.E. and S.E.)' in which they make the spelling optional but put Ba hrein before Ba hrain . 2. The present position appears to be as follows - (!) Permanent Committee on Geographical Names : Spelling optional but Bah rein is put before Bah rain ; (2) G overnment of India : Ba hrain ; (3) the Shaikh and his Adviser : Bah rain ; (4) F oreign Office : Bahrain apparently; (5) India Office : Bah rein ; (6) Passport Office : Ba hrein . 3* '#e ought now perhaps to make up our minds whether to stick to 'ei' or adopt the more generally used form of 'ai'.

No final recosmendation has yet, so far as we know, been made by th© Permanent Committee of Geographical Names as to the spelling of the nane 'Bahrein'; and there is no need, so far as we are concerned, for the Company to change its nano. Equally, however, there would be no objection on our part toiheir adopting the spelling 'Bahrain” if they wished. It is correct that the latter is^the spelling locally used and used on the Bahrein stamps; but we at this end have in th© past consistently used the spelling 'Bahrein and will probably continue to do so.

With regard to para. 4 in the Political Wr 8 ” e “° rand - No.797, it may be observed that grammars of the Arabic spoken in Syria and Iraq give the dual termination as -en (- ein); and although it may be -ain by the Hunterian system of transliteration, the P.C.G.N. has n&lt;-ver hound itself to adopt that system for names outside India. « In t}i e 'First List of Names in Arabia” the torm ei was adopted in some names in the Aden Protectorate qV a of the Resident, who stated that in b.w. Arabia the pronunciation ms nearer to ei (as in ”rein”) than to ai (as in ”aisle”). • considering the desirability of altering the spelling Bahrein to Bahrain, the P.C.G.N. would be glad le ? r ? the pronunciation, both local Arab and Indlan . 'the diphthong in that name is as ai in aisle or as ei in 'rein”. In some cases the P.C.G.N. allows alternative spellings, and this is possibly a case where such are desirable.
