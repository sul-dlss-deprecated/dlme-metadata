British Policy on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf.A v« X shall shortly bo retiring from lay present poet I thinic It would be uoeful if I put on record my riewe on some of the wider aspects of our policy on the Arab side of the Persian ftulf. 2« in a recent letter joride my letter 273- i, d ated the rci day 193d) X expressed some doubt as to whether it was generally realised how economical our administration on the Arab side was in comparison with the important interests involved, But this statement leads naturally to a considera tion as to wny we are able to implement eur responsibilities at such little cost, and X thinic the main factor is that on the wnole we possess the good-will of the Arab Kulera and their peoples. 3ne reason for their attitude is that as far as possible we let them alone to manage their own affairs in thsir own way, and being humnn they much prefer to mismanage these thenselves rather than have thma efficiently managed by ue. /hen by the discovery of oil in one of the states, e.g.Bahrain, there are sufficient funds for progress, we do not proceed to harry and hustle the riuler and hie people towards «effioiency', but content ourselves with providing them with experts to draw up simple plans, which the local government can put into force themselves, with advice, and generally s?ea*ing with friendly guidance. ;ven when they do / n otnot follow our advico, providod it ia not on a uuj iatie wo make no attempt to foroe it down tneir throats. Briefly we try to oarry out a policy based on the modern metnoaa oi ‘•indirect^ rather than the older ones of ■'direct’ r,ne. 3 # \ second reason for the good-will in question is that in our negotiations with the tulere, over oil, air facilities and what not, v# gire them a square deal* *e carry a money bag 9 instead of a thick stick and ars prepared to talk instead of t o threaten, this method costs some money, and takes time, but in the ena we get what we want, and with no soreness left behind. 1 This does not imply that our policy is a weak one. In any really serious differences of opinion between tue states and ourselves, for example with regard to breaches of their treaties with us, we are of course prepared to take a firm line, and a« you are aware on various occasions I have suggested taking drastic action, the threat, however, of this drastic action has hitherto been sufficient to aonieve our purpose, and for the last ten years or so we have been able to obtain our objects on the Arab side, and to enforce the implementing of our Treaties, without firing a gun or dropping a bomb. The third and most important reason for tae good-will 4 of the \rab states is tnat they regard His Majesty's Government as their natural protector both within the four corners of our Treaty obligations, and outside them. This in my opinion is tae outstanding and permanent factor whlcn in all important issues is at the back of the minds of the ft tilers and their people, and its local importance cannot be over-estimated. The Arab states have their differences with His Hajeety's Oovernnent, ami on occasions X daresay they find us rathsr a nuisance, in connection / with*ith for exaiaplo* At th« aame timo tnf^ hijow perfectly well tnat it is only His Majesty^ aoveruuent *no stand between them and absorption by Ibn Satid, Iraq or Persia, and would naturally much prefer to regain as tney are free and independent under their own r&amp;aikhs, and under our protection, than for tne r fltatee to beccme mere dletricte of Saudi ir&amp;oia, or Iraq or Iran, with their preeent Rulers replaced by oppress ire Saudi, Iraqi or Iranian officials. It is this consideration, more than any other single factor, which enables is to 9 run* the day-to-day administra tion of the Arab side vlth a handful of officials (one Resident, and three Political Agenta), without the payment of a single rupee of subsidy, or the upkeep (on our part) of a single soldier, policeman, or levy, which has a distinct and salutary effect on the minds of any particular Shaikh and his people when on any particular occasion our interests temporarily clash, and vmien in any serious emergency, such as a major war which so nearly came upon ue last September, would be of incalculable value. 6. There is in fact no doubt ae to the existence of the good-will of the Arab States, but we must not fall into the bad habit - if I may put it that way - of taking this feeling for granted, or of assuming that it will always continue irrespective of what we do or ao not do, particularly in regard to the matter of protection by His ajesty's Government. If a feeling were •▼•r to gro* up in th. \r*b state, that Hie Majesty 1 ■ Ocnrernaent •ere inclined to take their reeponsibtlitiee in this aatter too lightly the effect would be most unfortunate, and te speak frankly there have been occasions of late yeara when it has seemed to me that a line of policy suggested by His Majesty* s Government would - if carried out - have given this Impression to the local iulersmud ta«ir p«opl««. 3owe for inotanco# Kis Majosty't (lovermoot In order to assist the Iraq Government in the matter of ohecklng amut&amp;ling from Kuwait, though it was com,ion ground that Juridically this was a matter for the Iraq Government to deal with, were in favour of bringing 'pressure* to bear on the Shaikh in order to induce him to co-operate with the Iraqi authorities. I was strongly opposed to this suggestion. In which I had the support of the Government of India, and finally for 'pressure' was substituted 'advice*. Recently also the suggestion by the Foreign Office on the subject of the sale of Idler al Meld to Ibn 3aud appeared to me, as to the India Office and the Government of India, to be open to serious objections. ' On the other hand the firm line ta^en lately by His Majesty*s Government in the matter of hostile Iraqi propaganda against Kuwait has had an excellent effect, not only at Kuwait but else where on the Arab side of the Gulf. 6. /hen it hae been suggested - in cases such as above - that 'pressure* should be applied to the Kulera of the Arab States to take some particular course of action, among the arguments adduced have been those of 'the wider issues involved* either in peace or in the event of e major war. Whatever validity the 'wider issue* argument may have held in the past it has in my opinion little to-day. The Arab side of the Gulf, a link on the Imperial Air Route to India and beyond, and the site of a number of oil-fields potential as well as actual, is a wide enough issue to compete successfully with most other isauss in this part of the world, both from the peace and the war fc^A9- T i p0lnt 0f ' hu * th * ’di.ooT.rjr* of • pooeiblo »ltorn a - '* w ' tlTo Military motor routo from tho hoad of tho Gulf to the Vediter- ■ftwowjii* AwdSa ranean via Kuwait and Amman haw added to its stratsgic&amp;l imp or t- 'wUi. ^ o I a nee. tr*VU(« CMowIaa: V id* A ^ T \ / '7 f '•7* Valuable ue has been tne good-will of tha Arab Btates in the past it will 9 in ray opinion, be at ill more valuable in the future* The whole of the Arab aide ia changing, and with extraordinary rapidity* In the laat ten years from a c il de a^c it haa become an international highway of the flret importance* Oil-fielde are apringing up* Into certain of the Arab states money ia pouring in, and in all of them new ideas are fermenting* Two reoent movements at &lt;Uwalt and )ubai are significant cases in point* A fe* years ago these movements would have taken the form of an attempt, whether successful or not, of a rival to put him- self in the poeition of the Bhalkh* Nowadays, however, these movements took the democratic form of the people in general getting more power into their own hands. There is much in my personal j opinion that is healthy in these movements, ana in any case wnether w# llxe them or not we must make tne best of tnea since under modern conditions they are inevitable* But tnqy will equally inevitably bring in their train difficulties of the sa^ie nature with which we have been only too familiar elsewhere, in India and gypt, for example, to compare very large States to very small ones. There has recently been agitation in Bahrain, accompanied by minor labour troubles in the oil-field, and both there and in Kuwait Youth Movements have arisen* neither the labour troubles nor the Youth Movement are as yet serious, but (and this is a factor which must not be ignored merely because I it is a truism) with every year that passes ths youths are growing into young men, exercising more and more influence in the States, while behind them more and more boys are following in their footsteps. )f the young Bahraini in a reoent letter *eightsuu) wrot ei / 'Increased- 6 - *IncreaieU educational faollitioa in recent years dare produced a olaae of youn^ men with a ▼eueer of education wno respond readily to press propaganda, listen to broad casts and develop politioal feelings, they believe them selves to be progressive and despise their illiterate parents who, since the youths are earning quite good wages, have lost all influence over theta. They are nationalistic, especially since they see foreigners earning more money than they themselves do. They inow that they are better educated than the ruling family and are inclined therefore to despise them. They come mainly from Manaraah and ltuh*rr*q, and most of them wor* with the Oil Company, in Government offices and with firma in Uanamah.* Uulqtis m utandl a this is an exact description of a large numbar of young Indians, Egyptians, Palestinians, and Iraqis. d. Briefly then the old patriarchal conditions of life in the Arab States, whether for good or ill, axe being broken ap, as they here been in so Many other Asiatic countries, but even lore rapidly, and with this break up will come the inevitaole consequent ces already indicated. Come of the local agitations and movements will be directed against the local Hulera, but some will certainly be directed against us, in fact is already being directed against us. Hardly a fortnight passes without an attack feeing raade in the Arab ^ress of Iraq, Palestine, Syria, or Sgypt, against iis Majesty’s Government and its policy towards the Arab Gt&amp;tee of tnq Gulf, under the convenient term of ’♦colonisation** accusations are sometimes brought that it is our policy to disunite the Arab Itatee, and on other occasions to unite themi in each case for / our f:\our ovn nefarious endei tnat we undermine the independence of the States, and uee our influence to favour our subjects and foreigners generally to the detriment of the local Arab; and so forth and sc on. It is all vagus and unsubstantial, and at present does not perhapa cut much ice, but then a large proportion of anti-Brltieh propaganda all over the world is of the same formless character which does not prevent it from having considerable effect. 9. I foresee therefore difficult years anead of us in the Arab states our policy towards which will have to be most carefully conducted, and the first step towards this object is a realisation by all the authorities concerned with the Gulf of the change that has taken place in these states. It is no longer a case of more or less compliant Shaikhs ruling over more or less submissive peoples, tucked away in an obscure comer of the world. The compliancy of the shaikhs can no longer be taken for granted on all occasions, and in reply to a threat of 'pressure” - as I point* ed out in the case of the shaikh of .'tuwait quoted in paragraph h they above -/are quite capable of taking a firm stand. In which case since His Hajesty’s Government are - quite rightly - opposed to certain drastic meaeires which certain other Governments would not hesitate to adopt the threat loses much of its potency. But even supposing the shaikhs are prepared to yield to His Majesty's Government there are now their people who in all of the States are acquiring more power through the force of public opinion, who in some of the states have already acquired regularly constituted Councils, and who in the majority of the States in my opinion will in the course of the next few years obtain similar institutions. (Much the same movement is going on to-day in the Indian States.) It is therefore no longer merely a question of wringing a reluctant consent from a ^uler to our proposals, but of careful consideration( 3 &gt; w of what tno effect of our proposal* nt*y be on hie people.

In view of all these considerations M pressure-policy' ie In my opinion a two-edged weapon, and before using it in any particular caee Hie Majesty*8 Government should reflsot most carefully whether they are prepared to faoe a ’show-down’ on the part of the Balers and their peoples, with the attendant repercussions in the Gulf and outside it. There la the further important consider at ion that In the difficult times ahead of us our chief inn will be the feeling in the \rab tttates that Hie MaJeety*e Government stand between them and absorption by their neighbours, and anything which weakens this feeling will add considerably to our difficulties. To sum upt (a) Our ’rule* over the Arab Btatee of the Gulf rests on the good-will of the Rulers and their peoples, partly self- interested good-will no doubt, but none the lees firm for that reasont the beet basis for good-will is not sentiment but oelf- interest. This good-will enables our day-to-day administration to be carried on economically, wor«cs in our favour whenever &amp; difference in opinion arises between the States and oureexvea, and in case of an emergency, such as a major war which was so nearly upon us last Beptemoer, would be of great value. / (*&gt; 10 . / V.iJOiJ / (h) rhi« «ooa-*lU dapcnds on tnroo'^FTafc'toro.

Ab I explained in paragraph 3 of ray letter quoted above I wished to take the opportunity of trying to cover the whole question of our polioy on the Trucial Coast, which in connection with Petroleum Conceseions Limited's exploration in the hinterland, and with the possibility of their finding oil there, might come again under review in the near future. 3* reightman's specific suggestions are contained in paragraphs 3 and 8 of his letters (a) More frequent patrolling by the sloops, including dhow searching.

Impressive as your arguments are, 1 venture to think that a dightly different background can fairly be depicted* 1 e have achieved certain important results along the Trucial 'oast in the past century and there has been a v^st deal of bargaining, discussion and negotiation. It is far from my intention to belittle the patience and skill with which these negotiations have been conducted, but let us be strictly fair and remember, as the Coast remembers, how often we have had to resort to 'power politics 11 , how often a deal has been clinched or an ax^gument ended by the appearance of a warship, or a threat, expressed or Implied, of direct action. intervals over the century the ships have fired their guns and the echoes have sounded for years up and down the Trucial and Batineh Coasts. In Bahrain itself we even assumed control of the administration at one time (actually, if not by formal declaration). 5* It seems to me there are two conclusions to be drawn from these facts. First, that the Shaikhs have little respect for eloquence or fair argument, but are quickly impressed bv an exhibition of the power of the British Coveminent, of which they need reminders froa. tin.e to time; and secondly that it Is not unduly difficult in the*e parts to relinquish even a system of close administrative control, as we have done in Bahrain. But I must repeat here, to obviate misunderstanding, that I do not advocate close administration. T have ar med in my demi-official letter Ho* C/197 dated the 2:2nd Search 1938 that all we naed on the Coast is rore frequent patrolling by the sloops (this of course includes dhow-searching, and denotes/-denotes in effect e demonstration of power), a reasonable sura of money to reward services rendered and to buy information, •nd more effective local representation. I still adhere to these views, though when we are dealing with the hinterland, the show of strength must obviously be in the air and not on the sea. This doas not necessarily mean that T went to drop bombs on Shaikh X or Iheikh Y or machine-jun them from the air, but I should like them to realise that if we thought it necessary nothing could be simpler for us to do. (a are, after all, still concerned in the main with ihnikhs of settled — as opposed to nomad — tribes). 6. The consideration© which led to the last paragraph of my demi-official letter Ho. C/794 dated the 23rd lecember were theses* (A) * party sent out to prospect in Baraimi and beyond by a company known to nave the auprwrt of His Majesty's Government, and accompanied by a Political Officer, was Ignoninously turned out by a bunch of impotent i^im and A1 3u ihamis Shaikhs. (B) h ;go tiations to enable the same party to enter ^eni ^itab country were rendered unavailing mainly as a result of intrigue on the part of Jawasimi Shaikhs on the Coast. The repetition of such incidents - and worse - can certain ly be obviatec by the mildest of threatening gestures, for, as you have said, these people are not formidable like the Pathane. 7. It seems to me it is not good for our prestige to accept these people at thair own estimation. Let them have their bar gains by all means and let us help them to get a square deal from the Gil Companies and so on. hit let us make it oerfectly clear that when we say wa want a thing we are going to get it at something approaching a reasonable price and without undue delay; and that obstructive tactics do not pay. e cane Into this Gulf for trade and are still here for its commercial possibilities and for the protection of our Imperial communica tions.

I cannot quite follow Fowle*s reasoning, however, in his summing up in paragraph 2 (m). He says that if oil in the hinterland turned from a possibility into an actuality we shall probably have to change our policy, but we should not do so until we knov/ for certain that oil really exists in this area. He then goes on^’In the meantime, in order to ascertain whether this is so or not - in other words, in order to enable Petroleum Concessions v — Limited to carry out their preliminary exploration - we shall have to persist with our present policy, slow as this may be.

I do not say that these difficulties could not be overcome, but the real question at issue appears to be* Is such an administration worth while ? (b) To establish a close administration over the Trucial Coast 1.e. to institute tribal subsidies (of which we do not pay a penny at present), build roads, raise levies, appoint local Political Officers, and work more and more through them and less and leas through the hhaikhs, ma&lt;ce ourselves responsible for law and order and the administration of Justice, employ the Hoyal Air Force for punitive measures whenever we considered it necessary, in other words to H take over' the Trucial Coast, all this - or some modification of it - would not I thin* be difficult. The Trucial Coast is are not formidable, lirfe the Pathan oi cne North Vest Frontier Province for example, and it would be mainly a matter of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India between them providing the necessary funds and shouldering the necessary new comaitments. (c) The result of this close administration, if carried far enough (an important point), would undoubtedly be that the Bhaikhs would (metaphorically) spring smartly to attention and salute when spoken to, instead of being extremely evasive, obstinate and obstructive as they so often are at present, and that /// that we should get what we wnotei ( or some of it) straightaway Instead of after long and tedious negotiations. (d) Theme is, however, no virtue whatever in a close administration in itself over a desolate area such as the True ial Coast which would merely oost money snd involve us in fresh commitments. 3 uch an administration over such an area is a necessary evil, which is only justifiable if we cannot get our objects by any other means, and if our objects in themselves are sufficiently important. (e) 'tfhat are our objects on the True ial Coast ? Up to some ten years ago they were ks follows? (1) The protection of the lives and property of British Indian subjects. (2) The observance by the ShaUha of our Treaties with them. (f) apeaking generally, for a period of more than a century these oujects had been achieved and preserved by a policy of what may be called *nari-intervention’*. \g' In about 193J2, however, a new and extremely important interest was added? the Truclal Coast became a link in the Imperial Air Route to India and beyond. The Trucial Coast Shaikhs were openly auspicious and hostile of this development, and it was only by prolonged negotiations that my predecessor succeeded in overcoming this suspicion and hostility, and in establishing the first air port at uharjah. Once the ice was thus broken it has not been too difficult for us to obtain the further lacilitiea needed though these also have been the subject of lengthy negotiations. I daresay that if we had had a close administration round about 1930 both the initial and the subse quent negotiations would have been shortened, but the point ia // tnat /that without it we got what we wanted. (h) About three years ago the Air Ministry and tne Foreign Office were inclined to think that with the actual increase of our air t and the possible increase of our oil, interests in the True ial Coast, not indeed a close administra tion but some form of closer control might be necessary. The India Office, the Government of India and myself took the view that since we were obtaining our objecte by our present policy of minimum commitments, it would be Oetter to defer unaertajting new ones until the latter proved to be definitely unavoidable. The matter was discussed at length at an Interdepar tiuci--a-*- Meeting at the India Office held in about October 195o, at which I was present. The final decision was to make no change in our policy, but to ’•wait and see*. That this decision vas correct is proved by the fact that our interests, new and old, continued to be preserved by our old policy. Aircraft, civil and Hoyal \ir iforce, continued to fly up and down the True ial Coast and to use the local facilities in perfect safety, and petroleum Concessions Limited geologists were able to carry out their explorations along the coast. (i) A further new *interest* has now arisen as follows. Petroleum Concessions Limited as a result of their coastal exploration came to the opinion that this belt of the Trueial Coast was not oil-bearing, but that the hinterland might possibly be so. They therefore wished to explore this area. Owing to the lack of control of the coastal Shaikhs over territories in the hinterland to which they laid claim, and to their obstructive attitude, and to the equally obstructive attitude of the hinterland 3haikha, it took us more than a year 7-5- to get petroleum ConoeBaiona I.imited parties into the hinter land district of T 3 arainii, and when they did get tnere they : -ave now had to return having acooiapliahed little or nothing in the way of exploration owing to the obstructive attitude of tne local inaixhs. This is of course disappointing but my own opinion ia that even so cy petroleum concessions Limited actually reaching laraimi, moving about to the limited extent possible, and making contacts with the local Shaikhs, the ice has been broken, and the way prepared for another effort. (I a m dealing with Petroleum Concessions limited laraimi explora* tion separately). (j) But even for the sake of argumait assuming that the Baraimi venture was a total failure, what are the broad considerations which we must keep in view ? -ur present interests lie along the coastal belt where the Shaikhs with whom we have treaties exercise a reasonable control, and where we can - ae has been proved - preserve our interests by our present policy of non-intervention. The last tiung we want to do, unless it proves absolutely unavoidable, ia to assume any responsibilities whatever in the hinterland where the terri tories of the coastal Shaikhs a re far from bsir^ defined and where the local Shaikhs appear to be more or less independent. ?rom the Intelligence point of view reports on the Shaikhs tribes and pl^steal features of that area, such as Howes who accompanied petroleum concessions Limited party has produced of the Baraimi district, are welcome, and in an emergency in case of enemy agitation and intrigue in the interior would be most valuable, but there our interest in the hinterland begins and ends. nth one exception - oil. But at present we do not know /ioiotf that there is a drop of oil in the whole of the hinterland Three years a^o before oil oame into the picture we were in different to affaire in the hinterland, and three years hence - if in the meantime it ia proved by exploration that there is no oil there - we shall he equally indifferent* To adopt there fore any form of close administration, or closer control, in the hinterland, merely to enable Petroleum Concessions limited to judge whether there is oil in the hinterland or not, seems to me distinctly not worth the candle. In order to get Petroleum concessions Limited parties into the interior we should therefore in ray opinion continue with our present policy □low as it may prove, of negotiation, and trust to the power of Petroleum Concessions Limited money bags to bring round the Ch&amp;ikhs in time. (k) as you are aware I am of the opinion that oil on the Arab side of the £ulf from the strategical point of view is of first-rate importance owing to the uncertainty of its supply from the Persian side in time of war, and I have ta*en various opportunities of expressing this opinion to the India Office and the Government of India. If therefore as a result of Petroleum concessions Limited exploration oil is found in the hinterland an entirely new situation will in my view be created. This situation will presumably develop in two stages. In the first Petroleum Concessions Limited will declare that in such and such areas experimental drilling is worth while. This will involve tne importation of machinery, the forming a Petroleum Concessions Limited camp or camps, and so forth, and to effect these we will probably have to take on some fresh commitments in the interior. At the same time care /v&gt; -7- oar« will have to be taken that we do not commit oureelveo too deeply since the result of these experimental drillings nay well be negative, in which case once more we shall have little concern with the interior. On the other hand if the results are positive and an oil field, or oil fields, on the Bahrain scale, spring up in the interior, though even then we should do our best to avoid all unnecessary commitments, we may hove to adopt a policy of closer control. But this will then ce unavoidable and will be undertaken for an object of Imperial strategical importance which makes it well worth while. ( l ) I have said above that a close administration would get us what we wanted straightaway instead of after long negotiations. I very much doubt, however, if such an adminis tration would act as a magic formula, a sort of ’open sesame', for all our difficulties. Wo matter how close our administra tion was, the territories in question would still belong to the Shaikhs, and we would still have to allow them scope for drivir^ hard bargains with us, or any oil Company involved. (m) To sum up . There is only one test of a policy and that is its success or failure. Judged by this test our policy on the fractal Coast of non-intervention, however hani-to-mouth and peculiar it may appear judged by the standards of other and more regular administrations, emerges with flying colours. For more than a century it has by and large obtained for us our objects with the minimum of commit ments, financial and political, and in recent years when net* 3ritish interests have been created it has still delivered the goods. ?e have now a fresh interest on the Trucial Coast: possible oil in the hinterland, and if this oil turns from /oc+ OBYXfi»*«ir ♦ ifr&amp;oo vo ti o i aw ?^pff ed o t svnri Hit? sji^d Llati 'ifiiz w^nitilth lijjtiaiai-raQxe lo jivwi jwri^ aon.e ol^dxi av.ts*l XX/tf*a aw e^oft eDiro iMMo aoirtw ni thY&amp;tw&amp;tn ad aliuna*! j. j 11 i .f-ic* ':t* K * .roxTs^ai -ixCl rfdxw n .‘&gt;o oo ilizlltt* -nil ffC | a 6* J a 11 XiC 7(5 Xio Ojg fclXfJ awiiiaoQ aiB btfjoii* «&gt; riaxxt t icitra^ni axff al m$*l* t *Ir,oa avii. • v^* ew t «#na£r? 1 muc o ^Trasaatjaaft.^ II« htOYB #t rr; o oh »u aadd Hiw aii{$ It# 1 .!• o *»«oXo 'to ^ollou « l^oba t^LisamZ lo njt* 70 I oa IIIw Jb«A aid ^i iov^tc *#£i 4 « df^OW Il 9 » Jl i f;; . ; ( -. 7 .in iiiLQ* aoi $B%i Hitiimma jsoIo s t^cU ^vodf? fria# 9 vax1 I ' (I) 3 ^wX to its ic aai aids iiadnaw ar larfw 90 ? 9 &amp; ••!'• tl . •v--,.. :, % 33iX.h not-r I .91*01 , t SiSA»iUX u»QO ' •i-' Ji (Bit ciiiB® J5 SB f-I i OV ftf?! *37 ? -zi}*talmhm 9*01* mM tmtima oH ttto II s 7cl r. i: :-.v flt se'170 »iid f !tsw x»I# Tal 9 ^ 00 * xs^xU -sclu* u: svaxi liile bluo^ 9 ^ tag arij •ftdvXovn: ^rr^qfoioi: I la x*t» ^ «av rlli vr s^i Maxi yslYliB .’ .• ;, 7 rnr xl^ #1 ... _ 1 ; ' :, . - r/;di to 8»9am:a adi t.

But It ia far from worth our while to change this policy until we know for certain that oil really exists in the area concerned. In the meantime in order to ascertain whether this is so or not, in other words in order to enable Petroleum Concessions .Limited to carry out tneir preliminary exploration, we shall have to persist with our present policy slow as this may be. '4.3.^*? u do J* 3. On my views as given above there is one criticism which you might fairly offer. Your paragraph 6 to which I refer was very brief, and it is quite possible that some form of closer control only and not the close administration which I have also dealt with was in your mind. This may very well be the case, but &amp;s the failure of Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration does definitely raise a new issue on the Trucial Coast, and as the question of a close administration in that area may be raised sooner or later, I thought this a good opportunity to try and cover the whole ground. Another consideration is this. as we have found to our coot in various parts of the world, particularly in the Knst, it is extremely easy to start a forward policy, but once having done so it is extremely difficult to change into reverse and start a backward one, and it is almost equally difficult to have a limite d forward policy. One thing inevitably leads to another, and a policy of closer control, initiated for a specific object over a limited area, gradually and insidiously leads only too often to &amp; close administration over a much larger area, which was far from being the original intention.I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Yours sincerely* sd.

(Sgd.) R. PEEL-My dear Walton, Many thanks for letting me see these papers. I will readily, If you wish, show them to Lord Linlithgow, who has taken a good deal of Interest In this area, but have not In fact done so. 2. So far as an A.P.A. on the Trucial Coast Is concerned, I myself have never had the least doubt that this Is desirable and every year seems to me to make it more desirable. The Residency Agent might have done in the old days when there were no Europeans wandering about in the hinterland and little or no money from outside (even so, Abdul Latif's family established themselves in a very considerable property as a result of three generations of this type of work). At the present time, when the young Sultan of Muscat shows definite signs of quality and when, as I know, from his own conversations with me, he is concerning himself about his hinterland, about Baraimi, and about his relations with the Imam, I am sure that we ought to have somebody on the spot. 3. Equally the troubles we are at the moment having with Abu Dhabi over slavery point to the necessity for this and it is in any event most unsatisfactory that we should be getting into a position in which oil agents or people like Holmes know much more about what is going on in the hinterland than we do, or.are*at any rate in a position to make statements as to boundaries, tribal situations, etc., the correctness of which we cannot with confidence challenge and which may be embarrassing to us. I agree with the Resident that the first idea of the A.P.A. Bahrein was that he should be used for this purpose. But he never has been, or only to the minutest degree, and he spends most of his time in Bahrein dealing with court cases.4. What is wanted In my judgment is a young political officer with some knowledge of Arabic^ would be H definitely rather under-worked. I would start him off in the first year in the Kest House at Shargah, so that too much fuss would not be created on the Coast by a proposal to fix him in a house in one of the sheikhdoms, and I would make it his business to move slowly about up and down the Trucial Coast and even into the Muscat area. He could be subordinate, iSwever, to the P.A. Bahrein (this might be better) or to the Resident. Unless the Admiralty attitude is changed they would welcome it. Sir Trenchard Fowle has always been opposed to this idea, but I am sure the case is a good one and I hopeit may be pressed. As I say, I have not mentioned the matter/to the Viceroy, but I think he would support the idea. 5. As regards getting an A.P.A., this raises the financial question, as does also Weightman’s suggestion for the spending of money on intelligence. It has been with very great difficulty, and only thanks to the personal interest taken by the Viceroy, that Grigg has agreed to restore a maximum of 6 lakhs for the Bushire Residency, and I am quite sure that it would be an error of tactics to go back to the Government of India on any question of Gulf expenditure until the contract budget has been accepted. I ought also to say that I see hot the least prospect of their giving way over the contract budget and I think it is worth pushing on here because it is very likely that the position in regard to it will be raised by the Finance Department in connection with next year's budget. 6. E.T. Coates, CIE., ICS., who, as Joi the Finance Department, dealt with most of - moment on leave and you might think it worth talking to him;3 'v,C. •A Cau^ &lt;LA/0~l JL'J, but I repeat that I do not think it would be wise to go to the Government of India, even on small items of expenditure, at this stage. The A.P.A. problem might, pending settlement of the general question, be solved by using the A.P.A. Bahrein on the lines I have suggested. The P.A.will have a fuller day than he had before, but after all, the whole object of the creation of the post was to make someone available for work in the Trucial area. 7. On the matter of control, I entirely agree with your comment. The fact is, crude as it may sound, that these areas, with the oil and the rest, are becoming much too important for us to allow the fiction of independence (for it is a fiction) to be carried too far. And the case of Koweit and the developments there in the last few days clearly show how unsubstantial the authority of the individual ruler may turn out to be and how great is the risk of complications arising which may interest Iraq or Persia or even foreign countries, unless we keep a firm hand on the policy and personality of the rulers. The Resident again has always been opposed to stiffening up our Koweit policy, and, while fully recognising that we are in a bad moral position vis-a-vis the Sheikh because of the date gardens, etc., I cannot help feeling that a stiffer line would have been justified in the past and that we ought not to let the present opportunity of the establish ment of the Council etc. be used in any way to undermine or weaken our authority in the State. It gives us an admirable opportunity for making it clear to the Sheikh that without us he is nobody. 8. I do not know to what extent the Resident, possibly with some assistance from the Air Force, could make small/'“N suies of money available locally out of contingencies, or the funds at present at his disposal, for intelligence purposes;, but if this could be done without raising the general question, I quite agree that it would be a good thing.Mr. Weight-man's letter of 22nd March is most interesting, and brings a number of isolated recent incidents into a single focus. At the end he makes three specific suggestions for improving British influence and prestige, two of which seem well worth considering - viz ., (b) that we should spend a 'reasonable amount of money to reward services rendered, to buy service and to pay for information' (this does not necessarily mean subsidies to the Sheikhs); and (c) that our local representation should be made more effective by the appointment of a European official in place of the Arab Agent at Sharjah. Sir T. Fowle’s letter discusses the general question of embarking on a policy of complete control. He is (rightly, I have no doubt) opposed to committing ourselves to this, but it does not seem to me that this question is involved in what Mr. Weightman suggests. We can surely, without a radical change of policy, take such steps as may seem needful or reasonable from time to time to improve our influence and prestige. Sir T. Fowle also, however, is prepared to consider Mr. Weightman's suggestion (b). It is to be hoped that if/if necessary his secret service fund my be increased for this purpose. But he does not support suggestion (c). The G. of I. support Sir T. Fowle's views, their motive being fear of additional expenditure. Pending a decision on their general proposals of 1936 for sharing, and their present proposals for stabilising, their own expenditure in the Gulf there is great difficulty in securing the authorisation for any additional expenditure After long correspondence, however, we have recently obtained an agreement between them and H.M.G. for the appointment of an additional doctor for service on the Trucial Coast, the cost to be shared between the two Governments. If an additional assistant Political Agent to reside permanently on the r rucial Coast is considered politically desirable, we might seek a similar agreement for sharing the cost of that, though it would be more difficult to get H.M.G. to agree (in the case of the doctor there was the precedent of sharing the cost of quarantine measures on the Trucial Coast). If, however , H.M.G. should agree to sharing, it is to be hoped that the G. of I. would not stand out while their proposal for stabilising is being considered. It/^ 7 ' LI It does not seem to me that it is reasonable to refuse to incur any additional expenditure, however urgent the need may be, pending a decision on the general proposals for a new allocation of expenditure. If the G. of I. do so ani the Treasury, as they probably would, adopt a similar attitude, important political desiderata might be lost merely on account of failure to agree, or delay in agreeing, upon items of expenditure of relatively unimportant amount.I t (id) •^fFAIRS INDIA PRIVATE AND PERSONAL. / cU^ Simla, the 5th July 1938. Would you please refer to my confidential demi- official letter No.F.312-N/38, dated the 5th July 1938, to Gibson giving the Government of India f s comments on the question of our policy on the Trucial Coast, which was raised by Weightman in his demi-official letter No.C/197 of the 22nd March 1938 to Fowle 1 ? as you will see from Fowle f s demi-official letter No.254-S. of the 19th May 1938 to Gibson, he did not agree with ••eightman f s views and our comments in my letter referred to above support Fowle rather than Vvelghtman. You will also observe that we have as usual brought in the question of expenditure in the Persian Gulf.Before our official comments were drafted Laithwaite saw the file and noted informally rather in sucport of V/eightman and in opposition to Fowle f s views. I should therefore-essiy have taken Lord Linlithgow f s orders before Issuing my letter to Gibson, but owing to Lord Linlithgow’s de parture on leave this was not possible and there was clearly no point in taking Lord Brabourne f s instructions on a question of which he had no previous knowledge. The result is that my letter to Gibson contains views which certainly are not in entire conformity with Laithwaite f s ideas and may for all I know be not entirely acceptable toto Lord Linlithgow. These views, as you will no doubt expect, have the full support of the Finance Department. In the circumstances, I thought It well to send you this private letter explaining the position in case you sare to mention the matter to Lalthwaite or in case the Secretary of State thinks it worth while discussing it with Lord Linlithgow while His Excellency is in England. My personal feeling is that it would be a mistake at present to adopt a forward policy towards y /ut^vo- the Trucial Coast and that the Govt, of India will be A most unwilling just at present to incur any Increased expenditure in that area.

While they realize that circumstances may eventually compel His Majesty's Government to adopt a more definite policy with regard to the Trucial Coast than they are at present following, the Government of India are strongly averse to incurring any further commitments in that area at present* As the Secretary of State is already aware, the Government of India are dissatisfied with the existing position as regards their financial commitments in the Persian Gulf and are hoping that a more equitable arrangement vis-a-vis His Majesty's Government may before long be agreed to. Mr* V/eightman's concrete suggestions would merely lead to further expenditure for which at present there would seem to be no justification at any rate so far as the Government of India are concerned and for reasons explain ed in previous correspondence, the Government of India could /To - 2 could not agree to undertake any further financial commitments in that area at present. It is also observed that Mr. Weightman puts forward as one of his arguments for increased control, the growing resentment which is being engineered along the coast against the alleged interference by His Majesty 1 s Grovernment in the internal affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. It would appear to the Government of India that this resentment would be increased if a more definite forward policy is deliberately adopted and to that extent it would appear desirable to continue as long as possible the existing policy of refraining from any but essential interference with the Sheikhs. The appointment of a British Political .Agent or Assistant Political Agent to deal with the Sheikhs might well increase the anxiety which is at present felt with regard to His Majesty’s Government's intentions.A copy of this letter is being sent to Fowle.

I must confess I didn’t until I had- written tne paragraph quoted above, when it occurred to me that it applied rautatia mutandis to the whole of the Arab side. 3. Here we have a coast line some 2,D00 miles in lengtn from Kuwait to Dhofar consisting or some dozen independent .Arab ^haiichdoma, in some of wnicn very primitive conditions prevail. In these GnaiKndons we have important strategical interests, the Air Route, oil fields and Naval Base, and between tnese ;&gt;naiadorns and their neighbouring states - Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Persia - are/ Aubrey Metcalfe, K.G.I.E.,0.3.1.,M.V.O. in the External Affairs department Simla.- 2 - U&lt; are Yarioua questions wnicn aftect us, and xne negotiations for wnicn in fact we conduct. We are moreover interested in tne trade of tne Arab side, and mucn of tnis trade is in the hands of Britisn Indian mercnants. In most SnaiJcn- doras are colonies of Britisn Indian subjects, wno even in the more primitive ones enjoy a nigh standard of security for their lives and property. In addition to our strategical and political interests, under our Orders in Council we actually administer tne law in tne larger Shaikhdoms both to our own subjects, and generally speaking to foreigners. Yet in spite of all tnese combined interests responsibilities and activities we pay no subsidies to any Shaikh large or small - the sums which are now paid to certain Shaiicns for Air facilities are of course rent. We raise no tribal levies. We do not maintain a single soldier or policeman on the wnole of tne Arab side. (If a Political Agent, for instance, under an Order in Council wants tne arrest of an individual, wno will not obey his summons or warrant, he depends on tne local police of tne Shaikh to produce the wanted man). Our expenses and commitments are in fact limited to one Resident, tnree Political Agents, and tneir office staffs J 4. I am far from advocating tnat we snould increase eitner our expenses or our commitments - tne wnole tenor of my letter quoted above was that so long as we get wnat we want on the Arab side (wnicn we are doing at present) there should be no cnange in our policy. I merely thought it might be of interest to point out how/* sent under P.L.?To.274-3 of 25/o/36. how economically our position in tne tfulf is maintained * I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibe on.

Note by Minister, Tehran. Political Residency at Bushire. ''i, i *3 His Majesty»s Minister represented the view strongly held by himself and the Foreign Office that the Residency should be transferred to Bahrain. The evacuation of the naval bases at Henjam and Basidu had introduced a new factor. The importance of Bushire as a centre had declined practically to zero, it was difficult of access by sloops of the Persian Gulf division, t,he Political Resident was far removed irom the Arab Coast where his presence was necessary, he was in many respects a hostage in the hands of the Iranian Government who refused tor ecognise him and who could make his movements difficult and his position undignified at any moment. His Transfer to Bahrain would put him in close touch with the Persian Gulf Division and on the Imperial Airways route between London and Delhi, it would also have the advantage of increasing our prestige on the Arab side of the Gulf. H.E. the viceroy favoured the proposed transfer on general grounds. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India pointed out that in 1934 the proposal to transfer the Residency to Bahrain hau been dropped mainly on financial grounds. The financial considerations involved were very serious and he doubted whether either the Government of India or His Majesty's Government would be prepared to find their share of the estimated £100,000/-. There might be subsequent economies in travelling and telegraphing by the Pol. Resident, but the initial outlay was calculated to be very heavy. Moreover it would entail giving up a post at Bushire where some officer ought to be maintained in case of collapse at any time of the present regime in Iran. H.M. 's Minister said that thislast point was a distinct matter. There would be no question of leaving Bushire without a British official. In the present state of affairs a Vice-Consul would quite possibly be sufficient, but the question of the organisation of our Consulates in south Iran was one requiring examination. Busiiire was now almost a dead city whereas Abadan had grown and was continuing to grow into a large and important centre, Mohammerah was an active commercial centre and so was Ahwaz which also had the railway and is the residence of the Governor General of the province, as to the importance of keeping some British official at Bushire as a safeguard in the event of a collapse of the present regime H.M f s Minister entirely agreed, but he thought that this vras a matter for which the Legation at Tehran should be responsible: it did not seem to concern the question where the Pol. Resident should live, as his responsibilities lay on the Arab side. In general it appeared that there was a measure of agreement that from the political and administrative as distinct from the financial point of view the transfer was desirable, but it was thought necessary before proceeding further to obtain the views of the Pol. Resident himself. Mr. Metcalfe undertook to do this.IUav The Air Ministry have asked for permission to send a copy of Part I of the Minutes of the 4^nd meeting of the Middle ^ast Official Sub committee, dealing with Trucial Coast Policy, to the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq for his infor mation. Before this permission is given, however, we should be very grateful if you would let us know whether you would have any objection. Vvyyr' tT. C* * r alton, Bsq. , C.

THE CKAIPi-LU ' 1 referred to the despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gull*, No. C/306, or the 16th November, 193- , to the Government of India, in which Colonel Powle had outlined for approval the policy vniich he recommended to ue pursued in future hy Mis Majesty's Government in their relations with the r iracial Sheikiidoms of the Persian Gulf. Phis recommendation was, very briefly, tnat no change need be introduced into the policy or methods which had oe-n maintained wiih suc^eoo for a very long; time past. ihe -s-ir i.irustry had, however, raised in this connection the question whether His Majesty’s Government should not, in lUc-ure, tame a more aciive interest in the internal affairs of vhe irucial coast than hitherto. He invited tne iAv Ministry represen tatives to develop their arguments before the Committee. Aid VICE-MARSHAL COURTNEY invited the Sub-Committee to consider in particular two of the recommendations con tained in Colonel Fowle’s despatch; their grst was.— (l) That His Majesty’s Government should avoid active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms.OCf- ■0 t' (&amp;) That his Majesty’s 3-cvermnent should refrain from pre venting hoot'id it las cn land beinveen Trucial Sheikh doms* (He assumed that under this latter bead there should also he included the prevention of internal disturbances in any one Sheikhdom). The Air Ministry 5 he said 5 Vvere^to their regret, unable to agree that either recommendation v/as consistent with Lord Carson’s address of 1903 to the Trucial Sheikhs. That speech had hitherto been accepted as tho ruling authority in matters affecting the policy of Lis Majesty’s Government on the Trucial coast, and as a basis the Air Ministry fully accepted it still. There were, however, incon sistencies between the policy contained in that speech and the policy now recommended by Colonel Fowle 5 and these inconsistencies must, in the Air Ministry’s view, be resolved, he drew particular attention to the following passages in Lord Curzon’s address:- (a) rc.l-a ft rapi: 1 . ”My object is to show you that you are no'c forgotten by the Government, but that tliej adhere to the policy of guardian ship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of the century”. (b) Paragraph 3. ’’The British Government, the guardian of inter tribal peace”. (c) Paragraph 3. ’’These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Govern ment, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs, there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with year rights or liberties”.'The British Government have no desire to inter..'ere 5 and have never interfered* in yoijp internal affairs* provided that the Ohiets govern their territories v/ith justice * ana respect the rights of tixO foreign traders resident therein. If any internal disputes occur* you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his inmuence* as ne has freqsently done in the past* to prevent these disputes from coming to a head* and to maintain the s t at us quo , i or we cannot approve of one Chief attaching another Chief by land* simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea* and thus evading the spirit of his treaty obliga— t ions 1 '*. Air Vice-Marshal Courtney pointed had changed since Lord Curzon mane this ti at as regards the first point win.cn he out that conditions speech* and said had quoted from Colonel Fowle f s despatch* it was tne Ministry that * if British int ere st s to any developments in tne internal view of the jiir were threatened owing affairs of a Trucial Sheikhdom Air power intervene wished to , his now p * or p do so Ma t ie s ty ’ s Government shculd int ervene. ennitted His Majesty’s uoveminent to revent hostilities* on land* ii they * and ne suggested that his Majesty’s Government should make it clear to the that they could and would intervene by land* if necessary. As the safety or Trucial Sheikhs sea* air or even the air route to the Far Last was now the principal British interest on the Trucial coast* the Air Ministry had taken the initiative in asking that nhe matter should be considered by tne 3 ub-C ommi 11 e e. he would tune the recent incident at Debai as an example. Colonel Fowle* in his despatch* had represented tuat the .action then taken by hi.s Majesty’s uovernmerio did not constitute interference. It was* However* to be assumed that this action was taken because the initish authorities feared that British livos and property might ultimately be threatened* if the quarrel at Debai had-4- developed. The Air Ministry entirely agreed with the action taken, hut he must make it clear that they could not regard it as anything hut interference, though of' a kind perfectly jus tifiable and consistent with Lord Curzon f s speech. They would therefore like to see the policy of Kis Majesty’s Government re-stated in somewhat clearer terms. Turning to the second point raised in Colonel kowle’s despatch, .air Vice-Marshal Courtney remarked that the passage which he had quoted from paragraph 5 of Lord Curzon’s speech was dictated hy the fact that in Lord Curzon’s day the only- action open to his Majesty’s Government was action hy sea. The advent of air power had abolished this limitation, and it was now perfectly possible for His Majesty’s government to prevent hostilities between Trucial Gheilchs on land as well as on the sea. He drew attention to the guarantee of protection by land which had recently been given to the Sheikh of d&amp;tar. In that case His Majesty’s Government had had, in the prospect of an oil concession being granted, a strong inducement thus to extend their commitments. That same inducement would soon arise on the Trucial coast, and, in nis view, his Majesty’s Government would be obliged again formally to extend their commitments accordingly. It was not, however, desirable that such further commitments should be assumed with the same haste and the same very brief preliminary consideration as had been the case in Qatar. New foreign interests were lively to appear at any time on the Trucial coast, and he suggested that immediate consideration should be given to tire question of applying to the Trucial Coast the princlines which had already been applied in the c-.-.se of Qatar-. COLONEL FOV.LE observed that, if the safety of tne air rout^ could be assured with the present commitments of His Majesty’s Government, he saw no need to extend them. He quoted in support of his view the recent quarrel between His Majesty’s Government end the Sheikh of Abu Lhabi overmeasures had the R.A.F. petrol store. In that case* successfully been taken (viz. , a threat to immobilise the Abu Dhabi pearling fleet) which were designed to aftect the people of Abu Dh&amp;oi ^ as well as th'-ir sheikh, internal interference had been necessary ? and the ohei^Ji 5 having given his signature to the agreement by v/hich he had allowed the petrol store* had simply been told that he must give effect to it. MR. IkNDhL suggested that it might be convenient if he spoke before the discussion progressed any further since from the Foreign office point of view there would be advan tages in framing trio Question raised by the &gt;iir luinis uiy in even wider terms than the Air Ministry had employed. While many of the principles enunciated in Lord Gurzon o speech of 1£03 might still be applicable, it seemed essential to recognise that the general situation in tne Gulf, particularly from the international point of view, had been completely and fundamentally revolutionised by post-war developments. Lord Curzon’s speech had been made at a time when the Persian Gulf had been virtually a British lake, under unchallenged British control ana cut off by almost impassable do sorts fr^m the North and West &lt;, The Ottoman Empire had proved no serious menace to this position. Theoo was no aviation, tnere was no oil, and there was little foreign trade. As a result, tne limits of His Majesty’s Government’s action had been set solely by themselves. To-day the Persian Gulf was one of the world’s highways, bordered by strongly nationalist States, whose interest in the Gulf was real and active, and the discovery of oil had led other foreign Powers to take an increasing interest in Gulf affairs. In his view, the time had cone, or was at least rapidly approaching, when his Majesty’s Government would no longer be able to maintaintheir previous policy of* me rely keeping others out, and living, as it were, from hand to mouth, but would be faced with the necessity of going either forwards or backwards. he feared that, if His Majesty’s Government tried to maintain a negative policy of non-intervention and minimum control, they night find themselves subjected to very strong pressure from foreign powers whose nationals wished to be allowed to enter the Persian Gulf for commercial exploita tion, aviation, etc. He mentioned in this connection the American Government's interest in oil, the Italian interest in shipping, the Japanese interest in trade and the Dutch interest in flying, as factors which had already made their appearance; and with regard to the first, he reminded the meeting that, when the Koweit oil concession was first proposed the American Government had threatened to penalise British oil interests in territories under American influence if American interests were not allowed to compete at Koweit. This was a threat which almost any Government was in a position to make with regard to British trade and industry, civil aviation, shipping, etc. In tliese circumstances a negative attitude would be increasingly difficult to' maintain, and if we were not to find foreign Governments intervening in the Gulf on behalf of their nationals we should certainly have to assume a greater measure of definite responsibility ourselves, as we had been obliged to do in fatar. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that the French and the Dutch might at any moment want to remove their air route to the Far East from the Persian to the Arab coast. f/ith regard to oil, Kis • ajesty’s Govern ment must face the possibility that it would be found in commercial quantities. In that event, questions of juris diction and of protection would arise and must be faced, as - 6 -at Qatar. &amp; ItfJ. Another consequence of the grant of oil concessions on the Trucial Coast would be the necessity of according protection to the companies and their workings anc employees. But the grant of such protection in its mam made it necessary to fix boundaries. For all these reasons the Foreign Office view was that, if foreign political influence was not to be allowed to penetrate into the Gulf area, it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to assume an increasing degree of better defined control, and generally speaking, therefore, he wished to support the Air Ministry’s views. COLONEL FONTjE agreed that the discovery of oil on the 1 rucial Coast meant that His Majesty’s Government must offer thoir protection, making it, of course, conditional on the actual grant of a concession. If oil were not found, it was clear that no guarantee was necessary. MR. REKDEL pointed out, however, that in Koweit the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s investigations had failed to find oil which another company had afterwards located. Moreover, in Qatar it had been necessary for His Majesty’s Government to promise the Sheikh protection in return for the grant of the concession without waiting to learn whether any oil was actually found. Even if it were unnecessary to grant protection in return for prospecting licences, this would merely postpone the question for a short period. Mhere followed a general discussion arising from the following hypothetical question: what would be the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-£-vis a foreign Government if, say, a prospecting party of its nationals were killed or otherwise molested on the Trucial Coast by - (a) Saudi Tribesmen; (b) Tribesmen of one or other Trucial Sheikhdom; - 7 -(c) Tribesmen of the hinterland owing allegiance to no Sheikh in particular. COLONEL FOWLS maintained that this situation need never arise since no subject of a foreign power could go to the Trucial Coast unless His Majesty's Government allowed him to do so and that, as regards oil prospectors etc., His Majesty's Government would take steps to ensure that any concession on the Trucial Coast went to a British company. MR. RENDEL pointed out, however, that a British company was not always available to compete - particularly in view of the Oil Agreement of 1928 between the various groups of the Iraq. Petroleum Company - and that in such circumstances it might be impossible, even if it were desirable, to keep foreign enterprise out. Foreign Governments wished to deal v/ith a responsible authority. Tho was at present that authority on the n, rucial Coast? Unless His Majesty's Government were in a position to say that they were ultimately responsible in all respects, some foreign Power or other might take matters into its own hands. It was important that these admittedly hypothetical questions - v/hich might, however, at any moment become acute - should be faced before the pressure of foreign enterprise became too great. COLONEL FOWLS said that, as regards aviation, there was already machinery for controlling the Dutch and the French air lines should they decide to use the Arab coast. As regards foreign air lines, he doubted whether His Majesty's Government had the means to exclude them. This drew from AIR VICE-MARSHAL CGUNTNEY the remark that His Majesty's Government did not wish to exclude them, but to control the conditions in which they should enter..mining do zne question of oil development, COLONEL FOWLE gave it as his view that, if American engineers were killed ^n tn^. iiucicil ooa.st, and the United States Government appealed to His Majesty's Government to take action, the rigiii. course would he to make the nearest Sheikh responsible and inform him that he must pay appropriate compensation, failing which his town would be bombarded by sea or bombed from the air. He quoted a recent case in which a dhow had been looted by natives at Debai. There, by making the Sheikh responsible the matter had been successfully liquidated and no inter ven'don had been necessary. The Resident, however, still maintained that His Majesty's Government could prevent any foreign engineer from going to such a place at all. CAPTAI 1 I PHILLIPS said that the A.dmiralty were in general agreement with the views of Colonel Fowle. They would prefer to see His Majesty’s Government keep a free hand by avoiding any unnecessary new commitments. As he understood the niotory of Inis question, the reason for confining guarantees to the sea in the past was that the physical arguments against any guarantee covering land operations had been very strong, whereas protection from the sea was an easy matter. The advent of aeroplanes had undoubtedly made possible many operations which previously could not be undertaken, but he was not convinced that it could be said to-day that they alone could uphold a guarantee by land, and that if we gave such a guarantee there was no chance of our being involved in mili tary operations. The case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah had shewn that guarantees were two-edged, and he thought that His Majesty's Government should beware of them. In Qatar the offer of a guarantee had clearly been the trump card in the hands of His Majesty's Government who had thought the offer of it worth while. It would, no doubt, be a trump card in other places too, but, in that event, we should, he thought, be careful not to play it too soon. His Majesty's Government should!3 ~ r (ix retain their freedom of action ae long as possible and no saw at present no reason wh^ they shooId sacrifice it. A guarantee of protection in inter-Trucial disputes seemed to him to have little object and no thougot it a questionable policy to give the oheihhs a guarantee against Ibn laud before theie was any oil in their Sheikhdoms which His Majesty’s Government wished to protect. He would ? however 5 on the general question, li«e to make a purely personal suggestion which was, cast His Majesty’s Government snouid again consider wh-echer there would not be considerable advantage in replacing the native agent ot Sharjah v;ho 3 he understood, had recently died, by an j)nglishnan. He thought it could no longer be maintained that Sha.jah was too dangerous for this purpose, and he hoped that this idea might be examined. THE AIR MINISTRY EEPRSSDHTATIVES intimated that, if the proposal were put forward officially, they would strongly support it. MR. GLAUSOH said that the India Office were in general agreement with the views of the Government of India and of oolonel 1‘owle. Referring to Mr. Mendel’s suggestion that, in tneir relations with the frucial Coast, His lajesty’s G-cvernment must now either go backwards or forwards, he indicated that the India Oifice were ready to advance when i/nd as necessary, but that they saw no adequate reason why His Majesty’s Government should not continue to pursue their present policy. If an oil concession were granted on tne Truciai Coast, for example, at Kas-ai-Rheima, the India Oifice would not oppose the necessary guarantees of protection being given. As regards foreign penetration of tne Truciai Coast in general, Mr. Clauson observed that while the political control which His Majesty’s Government at present exercised was still -1Q_-undisputed, it had often been convenient for them to be able to describe the Trucial rulers as being 'independent Arab None the less, the India Office would not wish to exclude the eventual possibility that control on the Trucial Coast might be tightened up by seme such measure as the placing of a British political agent in one of the Sheikhdoms, but their general policy was one of evolution, MR. HALS expressed a feeling that the Air Ministry were perhaps suggesting that fences should be taken before they were reached. THS CHAIRMAN remarked that His Majesty’s Government was of course responsible for providing protection for the Trucial Sheikhs against aggression by Ibn Saudo SIR A. RYAN said that he was concerned with the question of protection only in so far as it meant protection against Ibn Saud. The most explicit statement in Lord Curzon’s pronouncement was to this effect:- 'If you behave well, His Majesty’s Government will protect you against all comers'. His Majesty’s Government had, in Sir A. Ryan’s opinion, taken a serious risk in delaying the recent specific promise of protection to the Shaikh of Qatar. Their reluctance to respond to earlier appeals by the Sheikh for some guarantee of protection had almost driven him into the arms of Ibn Saud. He reminded the meeting that the Sheikh had visited Riyadh a few years back and while there had established relations with Ibn Saud which appeared to have been a great deal closer than was altogether convenient for His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL FOWLS held that His Majesty’s Government had, in their Treaty with Qatar, an effective instrument for prevent ing such developments and an adequate ground for punitive action if they materialised. In this case, the Sheikh of Qatar had, in fact, done nothing serious.AIR VICE -MARSHAL COURTNEY pointed out that even if this were so, the Sheikh had refused for years to agree to a landing ground in Qatar although it had been strongly pressed for. Reverting to the incident at Debai in October 1934, Air Vice-Marshal Courtney repeated that the Air Ministry were unable to find that the pronouncements of the Government of India covered the support which the Royal Air Force had affor ded. The Air Ministry, he said, were of course at all times ready to give this support, but he must point out that they had not formally assumed any obligation to do so. The second proclamation issued by Colonel Fowle on the 24th of October had warned the inhabitants that !T 0 those responsible will be held to account''« This was in the last resort a threat of force and it implied that His Majesty's Government were prepared to take action beyond any that was now formally provided for. If, therefore, the policy recommended by Colonel Fowle was to be approved, the /iir Ministry must press, if only out of consideration for the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq., that the Committee should make a recommendation to clarify the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to such action. MR. RENDER suggested that, if His Majesty's Government v/ere to admit their ultimate responsibility for the affairs of the Trucial Coast, such eventual action might be covered. AIR VICE-MARSHAL COURTNEY and AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT referring to the fact that in certain possibilities the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq might be called upon for assistance, both insisted strongly that these possibilities were not by any means remote. They v/ere, in fact, daily becoming more urgent and when there were oil concessions to be protected the Royal Air Force would need more facilities, such as landing grounds, than were at present available. They could not, therefore, agree to leave the matter in an uncertain state.* -13- 'w THE CHAIKHAE then propoced, and the Sub-Committee after some further discussion agreed, to recommend as follows ( 1 ) that His Majesty’s Government must admit ultimate international responsibility for the affairs of the fracial Coast, including Qatar; (2) that the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. might be informed that intervention on land in the Trucial Sheikhdoms was an additional commitment which he might in certain circumstances be called upon to meet; ( 3 ) that the interested Departments should examine the personal suggestion put forward by Captain Phillips* for the apnointment of an Englishman as agent on the Trucial Coast in place of the present native Residency agent at Sharjah; ( 4 ) that as the departments represented on the Sub-Committee were unable to reach agreement as to the necessity otherwise for a new pronouncement or the adoption of a new policy in the Persian Gulf, this matter should therefore be reserved for further consideration. Of ii6 /Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, Air Vice-Marshal Burnett, Captain Phillips and Mr. Sesl then left the meeting wmich proceeded to discuss the question, of the Eastern and South- Eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia.

Note by the Secretary, covering letter dated 5th September, 1935, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the India Office. (Paper No. M.E. (0) 190). THE CHAIRMAN opened the discussion by saying that he understood that the situation was that a deadlock had been reached in the negotiations with the Saudi Government over the question of the frontier, and from the papers that he had read on the subject it did not look as though there was much hope of reaching a solution. Ee was not personally tamiliar with the question and his observations were, therefore, made primarily with the object of eliciting information, but ne would be glad to know whether it could be regarded as satis factorily established that it was, in fact, worth while pursuing the negotiations in these circumstances, really a matter of urgency that these bounuaries should be settled? Was it not a fact that the permanence of the Saudi -14-Ill “N Empire depended to a large extent on the life of one man - ning Ihn Baud? Were the Sub-Committee satisfied that, in these circumstances, it was desirable that His Majesty’s Government should hind themselves to a particular frontier in these areas despite the uncertainty of the future? SIR A. RYA'rT explained that the settlement of the frontier was now an urgent matter for two main reasons. In the first place, as regards the northern end of the frontier, the question of oil new made an early settlement imperative, since disputes Pad arisen over the areas of certain imporuanc. oil concesoions. Secondly, the action which His Majesty’s Government had been obliged to take in defining their interpretation of the frontier had created in Ibn Saud a genuine sense of injury which was poisoning- the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia. Sir A, Ryan was anxious to see this source of friction removed since at present it was rendering &amp; ng±o—Sauua. relations extremely difficult, and furnishing a ready handle uo all those who wished to exploit Ibn Saud’s feeling of resentment to the disadvantage of His Majesty’s Government. MR. RENDER further developed Sir A. Ryan’s points. In the first -olace, the oil question was one oi increasing urgency, since King Ibn Saud had now openly challenged the situation created by the grant by the Sheikh of Qatar of an oil concession over his territory to the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company. Ion Saud had protested strongly against this concession, and had even threatened to take steps to prevent its exploitation. luruher, there was reason to believe tnat t he rjneric&amp;n oil interests who had obtained a concession from Ibn Saud would, be quite ready to extend their operations over the disputed area, thus confronting His Majesty's Government with a most embarrassing f a at a c c cm pip. Again, various interests were actively seeking to obtain an oil concession (or at least a prospecting licence) from the Sheikh cx Abu Dhabi, which would lead to further difficulties if no boundary existed. -15-Secondly? unless some boundary could be agreed upon, there would be no limit to Ibn Baud’s expansion towards the coast, and to his continued penetration into the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. It would pay us better to agree on a boundary which would set a term to his expansion, than, by leaving the situation fluid, to risk finding that he had further extended his influence over - and possibly even in some cases completely absorbed - the territory or tribes of our proteges. Thirdly - and this was a point of great importance - His Majesty's Government were confronted with a situation of great delicacy and even danger in the Hed Sea area. The Italians were making strenuous efforts to extend their influence and unaermine our position, and were constantly making advances to Ibn Saud. While it might not be to the latter’s ultimate interest to responu to these advances, he might be driven to do so if he felt that His Majesty’s Govern ment were not prepared to give him a ‘'square deal”. It was, therefore, of major political importance that we should treat Ibn Saud as generously as possible over the grievance which he felt against us in this matter of the frontier. Lastly, His Majesty’s Government were committed to continue negotiations by their acceptance of Ibn Saul’s invitation to Sir A. Ryan to visit Riyadh on his return to his post next month. It was essential that Sir A. Ryan should have instructions enabling him to make constructive proposals at his meeting with the King, and, if these instructions were to be ready before his departure, time was extemely short. MR. CLAUSOH said that the India Office, without necessarily accepting all the Rcreign Office arguments, did not wish to dissent from Mr. Rendel’s conclusion, and agreed that it would be convenient to reach an early settlement. They would not, however, regard failure to reach an agreement v/ith Ibn Saud over this question of the frontier as necessarily disastrous.MR. EfcHDEL then bummaiibed the raccnt history Ox the question. He recalled that ? as a resalt oT *jnex‘ic.^n en quiries, his lia^eety’s iovernmant had felt obliged to define their interpretation of the legal position&gt; which eas that the frontiers set up by the .inglo-Turhish Con mentions 01 1113 and 1914 (i.e. * the “blue' and 'violet' lines) were still internationally valid. fire fact that one oi tnoee Conventions had not been iatiriod was irrelevant since ohe frontier was fully covered by the ratified Convention. Moreover, legally' Ibn laud could not escape i rom the liabilities of an Ottoman succession state* especially in view of his pre-war agreement with the Ottoman Government, by which he accepted Ottoman suzerainty. But a careful re-examination of the question had shown tnat, while the legal position might have been unassailable had the territory on the non-Saudi side of the line seen under uhe effective sovereignty of any other Power, there would oe great difficulty in holding Ibn baud back, as it were, against a vacuum means as strong- less, our policy the principle of . Our position was, therefore, by no as we had at first supposed. hoverthe- hitherto had been consistently based on holding Ion baud back as far as possible 9 and the weakness of our position had always been that we could nunce no effective positive claims on behali oi our selves or our proteges to the territory on the eastern side of the line we had proposed, out that it was still against a vacuum that we were trying to establish tre eastern limit of Ibn baud’s, dominions. Our object had, of course, been not to commit ourselves to a recognition of Saudi authority over an area over which it might wane on the termination of Ibn Baud's personal rule; bit itthe maintenance of this negative now seemed plain that policy would he impossible. I bn £ and had made it deal- that he would only be willing to discuss the mutter on trie basis of positive claims on behalf of our proteges, and it v/as only by following up sue . a positive policy the*.t a settlement was now lihely to be reached. Although it was easy to be wise after the event, Mr. Rend el felt bound to say tnat he thought our tactics had been faulty. having obtained from Ton oaud on the 3rd April last e clear and reasoned - though no doubt tardy and exaggerated - statement of his claims, we had virtually ignored his proposals and retorted immediately by proposin,.first one and then another artii icial line which we really could not adequately defend. One of our hey points on our proposed line rad oeen tne well of Banalyan, and it was largely on this point tnat tne deadlock had been reached in June# But new it was clear, from later information from British authorities in the Persian Gulf, that the -Sheikh of Abu Bhabi had no real claim to Banalyan, that it was a predominantly Burra well, and that it would be necessary to give way over it. hr. Pcndel therefore suggested that his i.laiesty T s Government should now try to define a new frontier line, / / based on the reasonable maximum claims of cur proteges and on the reasoxiable claims of Ibn Baud to suzerainty over certain tribes ? such as the hurra, bearing in mind at the same time questions of oil and of protection, but without giving too much importance to tne risk of a possible vacuum on the Saudi side of it# r fhe necessary data were now available, and he was prepared to melee general suggestions for such, a line.- 19 - m- MR. CLAUSOH said that he understood dr. Eendel’s proposal to be that Eie Majesty's Grovernment should now agree, as it were, to transfer the vacuum to the Saudi side of the frontier. But it seamed undesirable to eetaolisn any irentier lino further than the limits of I bn baud’s real author j. cy» -i frontier v/as to be fixed on the basis of the limits of one territory over which the Tracial Sheikhs exercised any authority * it might conceivably oe desirable to re/i've tu.e idea of a ,r desert zone” ? though 3 he himself, did not know much about the details of this idea and believed it had not found favour with the Committee. Otherwise, while further con cessions to Ibn Gaud in the desert area might be considered 11 there were a really firm prospect of agreement, the India Oluce coula not agree lo the boundaries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms being fixed and to Ibn oaua being allowed to come right up to them. MR. PhNDEL said tuat it now seemed inevitable that the boundary should be co-terminous, but explained tnat the line that he was about to suggest was not intended to constitute a frontier in the ordinary sense of the word. It haa al ways been clearly recognised that frontiers in the European sense 'were entirely inapplicaole to those desert a^eas* On the other hand, the various devices wnich had been suggested for getting over the difficulty of a ^frontier” in such an area, e.g., a desert zone, a neutral (or uuattributed) belt, a purely tribal definition, etc., had all been found impractic able. The present proposal '.vas for a line which should, so to speak, bisect what would otherwise have been a neutral area. It was not intended that it should be a line up oO which the authority of each side should in practice be fully and effectively exercised. In practice the effective authority for each side would probably step short a long way from the actual line. It was a linemeant as far as possible to bisect tbo eapty space between the de facto limits of the t*c authorities, but which would nevertheless mark the ultimate limits to which each authority could legitimately be extended. It would necessarily be - as any line in the desert must be - an artificial line. But it should be so drawn wherever practicable as to proviue on either side for as wide a space as possible of empty , . , ~ n-&gt;-itpll v eivs the Air Ministry territory which would i.noiu.enuci-Li«y &amp;J- the space 'to turn round in' for which they had so often pressed, I'r. Rendel suggested that in fixing this line we should be guided mainly by the new information now available as to the areas predominantly wandered over by th~ -- uri a trib , i.e., the Hurra lira. Ke explained that none or cur proteges had ever claimed to exercise any effective control over the Hurra tribe, that His Majesty's Government had never seriously challenged Ibn Baud’s claim to exercise suzerainty over them and had acquiesced in Fuad Bey's contention that the tribe was under Saudi suzerainty, and that in practice it would be impossible to refuse to recognise Ibn Sauu s claim to wells predominantly used by tnat tribe. If ““J - 3 criterion were adopted and we were to base any new concessions on the latest information regarding the extent of the Hurra Dira, it was now clear that His Majesty’s Government must abandon their claim to the wells at Banaiyan, and this concession might be important seeing the stxes^ which Fuad Eey had laid on the point m London. on the other hand there were certain areas which rlis Majesty s Government could not in any circumstances concede to Ibn Saud. The first was the area actually coveren L,, Anglo-Iranian Qatar oil concession. ,jlieikh had, with the approval of His Majesty s Governmentgranted to the A. I. 0. C. a certain area which we had always re garded as 'being under his sovereignty. The limits 01 this (a copy of which was attached to the concession) area were shown on a map/whicn the meeting had oeiore It was cut of the question to hand over any of this area to Ibn Saudj who in any case had no claim whatever to it. fore- over, this would leave within the territory of yatar two important physical features which are included in tne area ot the A.I.O.C. concession, vis., the Jebel Naksh, which is the southern spur of the Jebel Dukhan ana an integral part geographically of the .star peninsula, and the A1 yalail, which is described (on page 50) of hr. ihilby f s book 'The Empty Quarter'' 1 'as forming ''the westward face of tne vatar plateau 1 '. secondly, it was an agreed ;rinciple that Ibn Baud should not be granted any outlet to the sea to the east of the Qatar Peninsula. he had no claim to any such outlet, v/hich he had never possessed, and his Majesty's Government had already committed themselves to the Sheikh of Adu Dhabi, whose rights they had recognised over this area; this had been clearly explained last June to Fuad Bey, who had appeared to appreciate the position. SIR A. RYAM entirely agreed that there should be no question of Ibn Baud being allowed to acquire an outlet to the sea to the east of the Qatar Peninsula. Basing himself on these principles, MR. RENDEL suggested as a tentative basis for aiseussion a new line running some what as follows:- (a) Starting from a point on the coast, say, four miles to the north-east of Qasr-el-Balwa, the line would run south-easowards to a point (which could be called key point 'A'), at, say, tne western end of the salt lake discovered by Mr. Bertram Thomas and known as the Sabkhat-e1-Amarah. This would give a small further concession to Ibn Baud in an area to which he attached great importance, without at the same time abandoning any tex’ritory to v/hich the Sheikh of Qatar had a reasOxiable claim. It would also establish a line parallel to the line of the A.I.O.C. concession and in comparison with the so-called ''protection line', would actually be somewhat more satisfactory from the Air Ministry point of view. The details could, of course, only be worked out locally, but generally speaking such a line would seem to take reasonable account of the physical and political features of the situation.O) From thispcirrt (key point r ^) the line would run due south until, the point (which might 'be called key point : B* ) where it would join tiie northern edge of the Hurra lira as defined in the latest information from Colonel Dickson and shown on the sketch map supplied 'by him, of which a blue print had been circulated to the meeting. This would give the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi a reasonable belt of coast to enable him to exercise the rights which we had recognised that ho possessed over the Fhor-al-Odeid. (This part of the line (between key points ’A ? and 'B ? ) would constitute the western frontier of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi Jo (c) Thence (i.e. , from key point T B f ) the line might run diagonally in a straight line to, say tue xiiter- section of parallel 2a and meridian 54, tnus rougnly following tiie northern limit of the Hurra Dira as shown on the blue print supplied by Colonel Dickson. It would be important, however, to be able to establish a good claim on the part of Abu Dhabi to some definite feature in the neighoourhood Oj. y^y point ’B' w iiere the north and south line turned and^ began to run eastwards. Possibly such a point might be found at the Dhuwaihim wells as shown on Major Cheeseman’s map, or at the well of ouiuk, which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi claimed, although Fuad Bey haa also put forward a strong Saudi claim to it. (d) From the intersection of parallel sc and meridian &lt;j4 the line would run due south to the point shov/n on Colonel Di ckson’s bl ue pr*int as S abkhat Mi jor a. i hi s would give Ibn Baud a small part oi the Manasir country, but leave tne bulk of the Dira of this tribe, which were mainly an Abu Dhabi one, ouuSide ibn Saud : s control u (e) If the line then followed roughly the southern limits of the Hurra Dira, as shown on Colonel Dickson s blue print, it would correspond broadly to the southern frontier offered to Fuad bey in uune, ana would produce a frontier line which would correspond with the latest information now received from nuen. MB. CLAUS ON expressed doubt as to the propriety of our de parting from the method hitherto followed 01 advancing oy gradual stages in the direction of meeting Ibn oaud’s desiderata. He suggested that if His Majesty’s Government adopted tne Hurra Dira as the basis of a new and greatly extended olfoi, ibn baud might be encouraged to hope for even greater concessions than Mr. Rendel contemplated. Nevertheless, he thougnt tho-t tne India Office might consider the new proposal favourably, ii it promised to lead to a definite settlement. lie as^ea ior ini or- mation as to the prospect of its doing this. MR, bLaXTER asked whether there was not some danger that, after this offer had been made, the Hurra Dira might prove to be even larger than the area shown in the recent sketch-map supplied by Colonel Dickson.ME. RENDEL explained that v/hat was proposed was not to offer to recognise Tim Baud’s sovereignty over the Hurra Dira as such, hut rather to make our latest information regarding the Dira the basis of a new and generous offer. SIR A. RYAN said that he had had in mind what he understood to he on® of the reasons for Mr. Clauson’s hesitation. If a large offer were now made to Ihn Saud, he might think that he had got His Majesty's Government ’'on the run' and wait for them to run still further. Sir A. Ryan could not affirm that the offer now proposed would bring about a settlement, as it would be based on considerations connected with the Dira of the Murra tribe only, whereas Ibn Baud’s statement of his desiderata purported to rest on claims to sovereignty over the Murra, part of the Manasir and two other less-known tribes. Nevertheless, he thought that the proposed offer, even if it did not lead to a settlement, would place His Majesty's Government in a more advantageous position. They could point out that they had given full consideration to Fuad Bey Hamza's statement regarding what should be included in the Dira of the Murra, the one tribe involved to which Ibn Saud appeared to have a strong claim; and that, although they had found it to be more extensive than the 37 supposed, they were not deterred by that fact from making their further information regarding it the basis of a new and generous offer. Sir A. Ryan considered that, if Ibn Saud retorted by pressing his other demands and a rupture ensued, His Majestic's Government would be in a much better position to throw the onus of the rupture on Ibn Saud by* arguing that thei^ had made him a very handsome offer, far in advance of any concession they had previously contemplated, and that he had refused to accept anything24 - short of hit own maxiinum ciemanos. Sir A. Ryan stressed Mr. Render’s explanation that what was proposed was not an offer of the hurra Dira as such, out of a geotraphieax line which took full account of it. The Sauai Government could be reminded that they themselves had been reuucea to defining their desiderata south of Pararlel 2h° N purely by geographical co-orainates. MR. CLAUGON said that he thought that the India Office would be prepared to agree, subject to the under standing that certain key points and areas, such as the Sabkhat Matti, Aqal, ‘ nc of course the Khor-al-Odeid, were safe-guarded for the Sheikhdom of Abu I/nabi. GOLOth'L RO'. hE indicated th? t he aid not opp ose the abandonment of Banaiyan. MR. REN■ hh said that the line he naa suggested was designed to safeguard the points and ^reas referred to by Mr. Clauson but that the two pivotal points appeared to be those which he had described as key point ,f A M arpi key point ,f i3”. It woxlu oe necessary to have at the earliest possible moment further data to enabxe His majesty’s Govern ment to fix these points and adequately to defend their claim to them on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Lhabi in the impend ing discussions with Ibn Saud. He therefore suggested that a telegram should be sent to the Acting Political Resident on this particular aspect of the question asking him to make definite suggestions for these two points, and to supply suitable arguments in defence of our claim to them for Sir Andrew Ryan’s use. MR. CLAUSON and COLONEL FOvvLM agreed that it would be desirable to ao this.CONCLUSIONS. It was ? 'greed:- (a) to recommend that bir A. Ryan should he authorised, in his impending negotiations, to offer ihn Saui a line based on that suggested by Mr. Rendel, accompanying the offer by general explanations on the lines which he himself had suggested, the ise alignment of the line to be subject to further discussion in the light of any further information anti data from the British authorities in the Persian Gulf and in the Aden Protectorate which the India Office and the Colonial Office respectively could obtain, particularly in regard to key points ,f A Ff and 'B'h (b) That the new proposal to offer Ibn Saud a line which should be generally based, even in the southern area, on the limits of the hurra tribe should be communicated to the Resident at Aden for his urgent observations. Whitehall Gardena, S.W.l 27th September, 1935.-1- @) SECRET, M,E e (0) 19S, COPY NO TRUCIAL COAST POLICY 0 The following extract from a letter dated 2nd October, 1935 from the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff is circulated with reference to Conclusion (2) of Part I of the Minutes of the 42nd Meeting of the Committee held on the 24th September, 1935: x x x x '3 e With regard to the conclusions of Part I of the meeting, I agree to them subject to the deletion of the following words in Conclusion (2):- ’’While no new pronouncement nor the adoption of any new policy was immediately necessary at the present stage”. As you may be aware, I told the Chairman before leaving the meeting that I was not at all happy about the conclusions as outlined by him and that I must reserve my position in the matter until I could see how they came out on paper. 4. I now suggest, therefore, that the words referred to above should be omitted from Conclusion (2) and that an additional conclusion should be drafted to the effect that the departments repres ented on the Sub-Committee were unable to reach agreement as to the necessity or otherwise for a new pronouncement or the adoption of a. new policy in the Gulf, and that this matter was therefore reserved for further consideration, 5° I do not think that there can be any doubt in the minds of the Sub-Committee that the views of the Foreign Office and of the Air Ministry were in direct opposition to those of the other departments. If, therefore, the minutes are amended accordingly, it would then become necessary to consider the next step. It seems to me that there are two courses open - either another meeting should be held, at which the matter could be further considered, or the Sub committee should submit a report to the Middle East Ministerial Sub-Committee, setting out the views of the various departments on the points at issue and requesting a ruling.' x xxx(?&lt;j) A redraft of the Conclusions, amended in the light of the observations of the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff is circulated. It is requested that members of the Sub-Committee will notify the Joint Secretaries as early as possible whether they agree to the revised conclusions, or if not put forward any amendments or comments they wish to make.

Under Secretary. of-.Statfe, Tracial Coast Policy. This matter will be discassed at a meeting of the Official Middle East Sub-Committee on Tuesday next, September 24th. Colonel Fowle will attend, and probably Mr. Metcalfe. The papers which will be before the Committee are those circulated with M.E. 1 O. 184, flagged. Mr. Laithwaite’s minute of the 25th May on P.Z. 2853/35 deals with the subject-matter of the discussion. This submission was approved by the Secretary of State (Sir Samuel Hoare). The position as regards this matter is, I think, quite simple. The India Office, the Government of India and the Resident are in agreement on the points dealt with in Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 16th November, 1934 (enclosure No. 3 to M.E.O. 184), and as probably both Mr. Metcalfe and Colonel Fowle will be present at the meeting there should be no difficulty in getting our point of view across. Unless you have any further instructions to give/( '&gt;2 . give, I propose to take this despatch and Mr. Laithwaite f s minute of 25th May as my text for stating the India Office point of view. May I have the papers back fairly soon, please, as Mr. Metcalfe will want to refresh his memory on the subject befoe Tuesday.SHIRLAND, MYCENAE ROAD, BLACKHEATH, 8«£*3* 27th August 1935» My dear Laithwalte, After my interview with Sir FinJfater Stewart I requested T L S to forward the enclosures and appendices sent with my covering report on the Dibai incident to the India Office officially. I think the appreciation (or Review I forget which it was) of the situation if read with care will give you sufficient foundation on which to base any enquiries you may consider desirable. Some of the other papers may, I fancy, assist in producing the 'background' you consider necessary. I think it only right and proper and my duty to mention in writing the request made by the Sheikh of Dibai after the incident referred to above, and which I mentioned verbally. It was to the effect that in the event of furtho? trouble in his Sheikhdom (which he has reason to expect in the future unless we alter our methods) an impartial enquiry should be held in order that punishment should only be met»d out to those responsible for the disturbance. This seems such a reasonable request that I urge the matter be given due consideration not only in the interests of common justice but also in the interests of British Prestige on the Trucial Coast and in the Oulf generally. It has been stated in effect that the request is an impossible one. Apart from the difficulty of punishing the Guilty parties it was said that the Shaikh must be held responsible for the good government of his Sheikhdom,/Sheikhdom, the policy of H. M* Government being one of 'Non interference'. The answer speaks for itself - If the Sheikh had freedom to act as he requested it might be reasonable. The number of British subjects and British interests involved complicates matters. Unless the policy of H. M. Government has altered since 1928 (and I as SNOPG had no information that it had been altered) it would seem that the application of policy was at fault. It is obviously unreasonable (anyhow to anyone with local knowledge) that the Trucial Sheikhs should be informed, as was the case, that H. M. Government takes no interest in their affairs or their local quarrels but that the rulers would be held responsible in the event of loss of life or damage sustained by British subjects. Such a pronouncement (promulgated more strongly than I have indicated) naturally encourages any small party of avaracious or discontented people to make trouble when they feel the ruler might be punished for their misdeeds. Neither does it seem consistent with the speech (approved by H.M.G.) delivered as recently as the Durbar in 1933 with great pomp and ceremony. I have been asked by at least two Sheikhs whether the speech in question was meaningless! In addition the ruler of Dibai is ever ready to help as far as practicable and has been called upon to settle their difficulties by political officers on a number of occasions, difficulties which in some cases were created by the political officers themselves. It seems to be ungracious when the Sheikh himself is in difficulties (aggravated by political action) that H.M.G. should takeno interest and unjust that he cannot take action himself wj&amp;bout a threat of penalties. I cannot believe that this is the intention of H. M. Government. It is not in accordance with Christian principles. Yours, etc., (Sd.) J.V. .gREAGH, P.S.

You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf; almost every man was a .mrauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace there was none. -hen it was that the Brit.sn Government intervened and said that, in the inter*-.* 3 •■'S 0l its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see iron this deck. The struggleBritish Government mid the Chiefs? and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer that eighto In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded 9 and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853 when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual peace that has lasted ever since» Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs? and a ''perfect maritime truce' — to use the words tnat were employed — 'lor evermore ? that in the event of aggressions on anyone by sea? the injured parties should not retaliate 9 but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf? and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the observance of the Treaty» Chiefs? that Treaty has not? of course? prevented occasional trouble and conflict? it has sometimes been neglected or infringed ; but on the whole it has well deserved its name? and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest among you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past? while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas© I u now eleven years since the last disturbance ot the peace occurred,. Chiefs? out of the relations that were thus created? and which by your own consent constituted tne British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace? there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors? and you have relations with no other Power.. 4-A Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has hound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Government, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask - ¥hy should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers? The history of your States and of your families, and the present condition of the Gulf, are the ansv/er. We were here before any otner Power, in modern times, had shov/n its face in these v/aters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme.Thcps is ons r &gt; ssp6ct ^.n v/hich 'th.s Chisi's ‘tn.6insGlv6s can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status ouo, for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simple because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that the strip z of coast known as the Batinah Coast on the opposite side of the ’Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the JowasmiSe nevertheless hiwS authority is contested in some -quarters. It is desirable 'that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as his representative in India, who is responsible to him for your welfare, that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future. x Bead ‘’Shamailiyah 1 ’.Office of the Po7i.itical Resident in the Persian Gulf; Camp, Bahrein, 16th November, 1934. Prom: The Honourable Lieut.-Colonel To C. Fowls, C. B. E Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To: The Foreign Secretary to the Government of Indi New Delhic Subject; Policy o n the T x ^ucial Coast . Sir, With reference to my telegram No„ 962 of the 6th November, 1934, in which I promised further details as to the settlement between the Sheikh of Dibai and his cousins. With the assistance of a report supplied by Colonel Loch, who was in charge at Dibai when the settlement was made, I can give the following summary# 2. ’With reference to paragraph 5 of my telegram No, 895, dated 24th October, 1934, the notices finally issued by me took the following form : A. I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins. You should, however, ensure that the lives and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger. B. The Honourable the Political Resident wnt. has heard that there is unrest at Dibai warns all inhabitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British suojects in theTown resulting from any disturbance those responsible for causing such disturbance will be held to account,, 3. Notice A contained a clear intimatirn to the Sheikh that he was at liberty to take what measures he liked to deal with those who were endeavour ing to depose him, while at the same time reminding him that proper precautions should be taken with regard to British lives and property. The Sheikh was apparently fully alive to his responsibilities in this respect and even before the receipt of the notice had placed guards over the houses of British subjects. Notice B emphasised the fact that in case these lives and property were endangered as a result of any disturbance these responsible for causing the dis turbance would be held to account. The causers of the disturbance, though for various reasons I did not name them, were in fact the cousins. 4 .. With regard to the causes of the disturbca.nce j . For some years past Sheikh Sa f id bin Maktum has had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Sheikhs Rashid and Buti, which culminated in an attempt on his life on 23rd September last and a proposal by them, during the Sheikh’s temporary absence from the town, to summon a majlis to depose him. On Sheikh Sa’id’s return, encouraged by the measures of support, mentioned in paragraph 5 below, accorded to him, he issued an ultimatum to his cousins demanding that they should either come to his house and swear loyalty to him cr quit the7 T M- (JCrZ 1| town. After lengthy negotiations carried on hy members of the A1 bu Palash (the Sheikh f s sub-tribe) a representative of each branch of the cousins presented themselves at the Sheikh’s house and swore the oath demanded. The result of the settlement is that the Sheikh’s position is now stronger than it has been for many years. The Sheikh informed Colonel Loch that he was quite satisfied with the settlement and considered his position now secure. He expressed to Colonel Loch his gratitude for the support which had been accorded him. I think the general result of the Dibai incident has been, if all goes well, to strengthen our position appreciably along the Trucial Coast. 5. Perhaps the most satisfactory feature of the settlement between the Sheikh and his cousins is that jt was made by the Sheikh himself with a measure of support from us which was useful to him* for which he is duly grateful, but v/hich in no wajr involved us in interference in the j.nternal affairs of Dibai. These measures consisted in the sending of a sloop by the Senior Naval Officer at my request in the first instance with Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan on board, (the Residency Agent himself being unable to leave Sharjah on account of illness), and then with Colonel Loch in charge; a flight of aircraft over Dibai arranged by the Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, at my proposal; and the promise of a -9-present of arms which I made to the Sheikh and which I ensured should he known throughout the Town. In this connection it may he noted that the Sheikh can on production of a 'No objection' certificate from me, import arms whether as a present or on payment* 6. As I stated in my telegram quoted above, the presence of the sloop and of aircraft had an excellent effect, and I am grateful to the Senior Naval Officer and the Air Officer Command ing for their close co-operation. Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan did good work and Colonel Loch cn his arrival handled the situation effectively* 7, The Dibai incident has been closed satis factorily. It raises, however, in an interesting form the general question of cur poncy in that part of the Persian Gulf. Tne recent opening up of the Trucial Coast as part of the Civil and Strategical Air Route, necessitating the establish ment of an Air Port at Sharjah, and o.l landing grounds, flying boat anchorages and petrol stores for the Royal Air Force aircraft at other places, has inevitably brought us into clc.se contact with that coast, with which until the last few years we were less directly concerned. This closer contact has perhaps tended somewhat to obscure what our basic responsibilities actually c^e. may be classified as follows : (a) The protection of the lives and property of British Indian subjects. Ii rna N nc '^ ^ je 0liu place to note here that as far as the commercial interests of these subjects are concerned it must be remembered that we have no Order—in ^unoil.7 T therefore we have no legal redress there as in Muscat, Bahrein and Kuwait for the claims, for instance, of these subjects against the subjects of a Sheikh, All that can be done in such cases is to try and induce the Sheikh concerned, through the Residency Agent, to force his debtors subjects to saois- fy our plaintiff. Such action if successful results as a rule in some kind of compromise between the parties. Who re it is not a case of civil claims but of danger to British lives and property in case of disturbance we can of course take a much stronger line and warn the Sheikh concerned of his special responsi billties in this connection, (b) Under our Treaties with the Sheikhs we must prevent hostilities at sea, arms traffic, and the slave trade. We are also responsible for protecting, the Sheikhdoms by sea. In the case of Sharjah, under the terms of our Air Port Agreement with the Shexkh, we have to protect him from any form of aggression arising from the air port being situated in his terri tory. (c) A new responsibility - the safety 01 the Air Route both for civil and Royal Air Force aircraft. 8. These are our actual responsibilities on which we should concentrate. We are not responsible for the enforcement of Law and Order nor for the stopping of hostilities on land though, as in the past, we can endeavour through the Residency Agent to compose differences between Sheikhs. We should net, however, make ourselves responsible for the ent oi 0i - agreements come to between the Sheikhs. We are, under our Treaties, not responsible for the protection of the Sheikhs on land, though doubtless in the case of serious encroachment, or attack, by a pov.eiful we should have to assist them. - 11 --/e are not responsible for keeping Shaikhs on their thrones when they can no longer keep themselves there. g o it is obvious that a policy for the Trucial Coast based on the above general considerations cannot be an ambitious one, but these considerations are put forward with strict regard to the hard facts of local circumstances. However much at any particular juncture any particular section of a Trucial Shaikhdom, including perhaps the Shaikh himself, for their own ends, might welcome our active- interference in their domestic affairs, there would certainly be an opposition party who would bitterly resent it. Moreover, and this is a most important factor, any such active inter ference v/ould sooner or later involve us in supporting such interference b; force. 'That are the forcible means at our disposal? (1) The landing of an armed party from a sloop (2) Bombardment from the sea (3) Bombing by aircraft (4) Blockade. (l) is a very hazardous measure. (2), (3) and (4) are practicable, but while His Majesty's Government might be prepared to consider such measures in the discharge of our legitimate responsibilities as set f•„ rth in paragraph 7 above, I am convinced that they would certainly not sanction them to support the consequences of some act of interference - however desirable in itself - which had been made in the internal affairs of a Shaikhdom. 10. With reference to the air facilities mentioned at the beginning of paragraph 7 above. The urgent necessity of obtaining these has inevitably dominated our policy on the Trucial Coast for the last five years. Ever since the decision was made to transfer the Air Route from the Persian-13- to the Arab side of the Gulf it is hardly an exaggeration to say that no Political Officer, whether Resident or otherwise, has b ;en able to visit that coast without being under the trying obligation of endeavouring to extract - as painlessly as possible - a r facilities from some more or less reluctant Shaikh. This reluctance was chiefly based on the fear that the obtaining of air facilities was merely the first ste^ towards the establishment of British administration over the Sheikhdoms, and the Shaikh of Sharjah, for example, was careful to insert a clause in his Air Port Agreement that the granting of that ^ort in his territory in no way entitled us to interfere in his internal affairs. This fear, I trust, the Shaikhs are now beginning to understand is unfounded (though it is an additional agreement for pursuing a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast), and the facilities in question have been acquired I am glad to say without the exercise of force, though only after interminable bargainings and negotiations which have left little time for the settlement of other matters. Now that these facilities are actually in being the Shaikhs do not I think regret their acquiescence. They appreciate the favourable monetary terms they have received - especially in these hard times, and in certain cases, as at Sharjah, they benefit by a public W/T Station and - shortly I hope - by a Post Office. The Shaikh of Blbai, for instance, has stated mere than once that he bitterly regrets his refusal to have the nir Port at his town. At the same time they - the Shaikhs - for some years ^ast have had to be harassed and hustled, when the, know v„ry well - and personally I quite agree with them - that ’haste is from the Devil'. Cnee the question of the Yas Island tank is settled, concerning-14- which Colonel Loch is paying a visit to Abu Dhabi shortly, the last of the air facilities will have been obtained on the Trucial Coast. It will then be possible for my toursj and those of the political officers under me ? to that part of the Gulf to assume the more pleasant complexion of visits undertaken to establish friendly relations with the Arab Rulers, who should now be left in peace to settle down and adapt themselves to the new conditions which the coming of an important air route has Irought to their territories. 11 . To sum up . The Dibai incident (paragraphs 1-6) was satisi.actorily settled by a general policy of laying the responsibility on the Shaikh himself of dealing with internal trouble. He was given a free hand to deal with those who wished to depose him, and at the same time was informed that he should take precautions for the safeguarding of British lives and property. The malcontents were also reminded that they had a special responsibility in this respect. The Shaikh had a measure of support from us which was useful to him, and for which he is grateful, but which in no way involved us in the internal affairs oi Jicai. Further incidents on the Trucial Coast elsewhere might mut atis mutandi s be dealt with on the same lines. witn regard to our future policy on the Trucial Coast which has been raised by the Dibai incident. h T e have certain definite responsibilities on that Coast (paragraph 7) which we cannot avoid, and on which we should concentrate. Ve should avoid taking on new ones (paragraph 8), the most important of which would be the preventing of hostilities between Shaikhs on land, though whenever opportunity occurs we should give our good offices to the Rulers for the composition of their differences. The main argument for avoiding active interference in the internal affairsof the Trucial Coast is that sooner or later we would he compelled to support this interference by force 9 which would be most unadvisable (paragraph 9)o For some years past our policy on the Trucial Coast has been dominated by the urgent necessity of obtaining air facilities from its Shaikhs (paragraph 10} who though they now appreciate the advantages which they receive in return for granting such facilities — have had to be hustled by us in obtaining them® The facilities in question having been received there will be more opportunities for cultivating personal and triendly relations with the Shaikhs* who should now as far as possiole be left in peace to adapt themselves to the new condicions which the establishment oi the Air Route has so rapidly brought about in their territory® I would be grateful if the Government of India, should they see fit, would give their general approval of the policy outlined above, which can then become a guide for the future® I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the Air Officer Commanding, British forces in ’Iraq and the Political Agent, Bahrain® I have etc®, (Sgd) T® Co FOWLS Lieut®-Colonel Political Resident in the I'ersian Gulf®ENCI.OSURE NO : IV . 177/1935.

Fir st of Several P art s. Addressed to Secretary of State, copy 'by mail Bushire. Your telegram of the 26th ultimo, 995 0 We have discussed this question with Fowle and our views are as follows. 1. The foundation of our policy on the Trucial Coast is Lord Curzon’s address delivered at Shargah on 21st November, 1903. The principles then laid down in our opinion still hold, with the addition that we have now to ensure the safety of the air route. This policy is again defined in paragraph No, 7 of Fowle ! s letter No,C. 306, 16th November, 1934. It expressly (? excludes) interference in internal affairs of Sheikhdoms, and differs in this important respect from the conception of paramountcy as understood in India. 2. The concern of the Air Ministry is limited (? to their) responsibility for tie safety of the air route. 2219 1031. Part Two. If this can he secured Ly a minimum of commitments as at present, namely, by specific agreements with Sheikhs for air facilities and our general position on the Trucial Coast as based on treaties and long connections, there is, in our opinion, no advantage in assuming new ones. In particular, we are opposed to suggestion that an announcement such as proposed by Air Ministry at the end of paragrapliNo. 3 of their letter should he made to rulers as this would imply a measure of general support in internal administration, the responsibility for which v/e should, not undertake. ii they break their specific agreements for provision Oj. nil facilities, they are well aware that suitable action ./ill be taken to deal with them. If at any time necessity for insuring the safety of the air route necessitates assumption of fresh responsibilities, the position will 'hn -Pnr^ri. 'but that is do t at present. 2220 1001 , Thir d ai id Jppst Part. 3. One other matter in our opinion requires consideration at present juncture. The development of Saudi power in Arabia has already led to negotiations with Ibn Saud for a definition of boundaries between his kingdom and the limits of coastal rulers. If Ibn Saud were to attack Trucial Sheikhs, or indeed Muscat, His Majesty's Government whether or not in conjunction with Government of India, would presumably have to defend them from aggression on land, thus adding to undertakings issued by Lora Curzon. In certain circumstances it is already intended to enter into a responsibility of this kind with Qatar and (vide India Office letter to Political Resident PZ 12 (?99)/34, 9th March, 1934) it is agreed that a responsibility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed. This hov/ever is an entirely different proposition from inauguration ox a polic, of interference in internal affairs, resort to which, in our opinion, is at present juncture entirely unnecessary. 4.

Please see the reference to Mr. V/alton of 25th March flagged A below, on the question of Trucial policy, and the views expressed on this subject by the Government of India in their telegram of 22nd April. 2 « I do not think it is necessary to enter into any very detailed discussion of this question, the position generally being clear. We may entirely agree with the Government of India that so long as we can secure our essential desiderata - viz. the exclusion of foreigners, the safety of the Air Route, the special facilities which we from time to time require either for the Navy or for Air purposes (civil and military), and the maintenance of „ as the special position of our proteges/against Ibn Saud - without entering into any commitments additional to those which we have so far undertaken, there is everything to be said for avoiding such additional commitments. The position is in fact a developing one and our policy must be conditioned by circumstances. Thus, we have of late, partly because of the increase in the importance of Koweit v/hich has resulted from the admission of Iraq to the League, partly because of the increased responsibilities which we have undertaken in connection with the grant of an oil concession covering the whole area of the Sheikhdom to an Anglo-American consortium, begun to tighten up our control in that area. In the case of Qatar we have similarly, as the Government of India point out, given a guarantee of protection to the Sheikh against major raids from outside and recognised his Heir Apparent, aeain specifically in return for the grant by him of an oil concession on terms approved by H.M.G. It is by no means unlikely/- 2 - r sa I-Ml 1 I R I MM &lt;1 m x unlikely that we shall in due course have to adopt in Abu j Dhabi a policy similar to that which we have adopted in Qatar* But there is everything to be said for holding our concessions until the last moment* If we were now to ecive the general guarantee suggested by the Air Ministry in their letter of 26 th February, on •1365/35* to the rulers of the Arab Sheikhdoms, that 'as long as they conduct themselves in a satisfactory manner H.M.G. would be prepared to support' their authority', we should&lt;^have^ so much the less to play with if and when the time came for securing some specific advantage, such as the grant of an oil concession, from the rulers in question. 3* •© can, at the same time, entirely agree with the Air Ministry that we must be prepared to bring strong j pressure to bear to secure our desiderata if and when this i recessary. A good example is the pressure which it is fun*.' proposed to bring on the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi because of his breach of the agreement intowhich he recently entered for the j provision of air facilities. A somewhat similar case was . that which recently arose over the removal from Tamb of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah's flag. The Dibai case, to which reference is made on the papers below, is not entirely parallel, but our intervention there has probably been of value as emphasising to the local populations that H.M.G. i are not prepared entirely to disinterest themselves in mainland happenings. Paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram is somewhat confused. If Ibn Saud were to attack the Truciajl Sheikhs or Muscat it would in practice be almost impossible for us to defend those States from his aggressions by land, if by defence the Government of India mean defence by a force, whether military, naval, or air, specifically provided for the purpose. Any attack would be a breach ofMinute Paper. Department. ' ^ XT Ibn Baud’s present treaty engagements with us; our first moves would inevitably be through the diplomatic channel and in the improbable event of a complete breach of relations pressure could be brought on the King more effectively in the Red Sea and by stopping the provision of supplies to him from the Persian Gulf than by any attempt at active operations in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. 5. I doubt if the Air Ministry will wish to press their point, particularly in the light of the latest statement of the Government of India’s views, and of the action which is now under consideration at Abu Dhabi. The Foreign Office are not unlikely to use the correspondence as a text for increased interference in internal affairs, but there should be no difficulty in dealing with this. As regards procedure it is suggested that the papers might now be sent, as requested by the Air Ministry, to the Middle East Committee, under the letter of which a draft is attached. 1 *aAA cxKcjlX {4 *5th June 1935 177 FILE COP* P.z. 2853/35.

Chiefs of the Arab Coast who are in Treaty relations with the British Government. - I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and fore-fathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years; and my object is to show you, that though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of the century; ana that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundrea years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-traaing flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship coula put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security ol trade or peace there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened and said that, in the interests of its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied/V occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853 when it was succeeded by the 'treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs, and a 'perfect maritime truce' - to use the words that were employed - 'for evermore'; that in the event of aggressions on anyone by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf; and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed; but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest among you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred. Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has ■bound/ ■HIi /8h) 3. bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any oth^r Government, and not to part with any portion ol its territories# These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal eitect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in dangei&gt;6f being forgotten, and there are persons who ask — Why should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers? The history of your States and of your families, and the present condition of the Gulf, are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modern times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence but have preserved it. »e are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government/4 Government must remain supreme* There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo, for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you x aware that the strip of coast known as the Batinah Coast on the opposite side of the ’Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis. Nevertheless his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist betweai the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of to British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as his representative in India, who is responsible to him for your welfare, that I am here to-day/ x Read ?, Shamailiyah”•L*— lkA. telegraphic comments on Air Ministry letter of 26th February, copy sent to you and Busnire by air mail of 28th February, which you will no doubt discuss^ with Fowle^ Ponding further observations by^yrru no action is being taken on it here. ■ i r •a ii-’ 3436a 5006 1.35Trucial Policy. The Resident made certain proposals on this subject in nis despatch of 16th November, on P.Z.7199/34; the Government of India expressed'their concurrence in them in their express letter of 29th December, on P•2*177/35. The Air Ministry warned me early in January that Air Vice-Marshal Burnett had submitted comments of his own on the Resident’s proposals, which had been repeated to him, which took rather a different view; and on 25th January wing Commander pirie sent me privately a copy of the Air Vice-Marshal’s report. On 26th February the Air Ministry wrote to us officially (there a had in the meantime been/certain amount of d.o. discussion in the course of which I tried to emphasise that policy of this type was primarily for the political departments concerned and to suggest that any Air Miinistry comments on it should be carefully worded). I have also in the meantime had some private correspondence with colonel Fowle, extracts from which are on the file below. I think the Resident has rather understated the importance of the Dibai incident, we did Intervene, and very effectively. But in general we should, I think, be in agreement with the line of policy he suggests. (It can be examined in more detail when the papers are submitted), our attitude is, I think, that it is axiomatic that there must be no interference with the air route and that we should be prepared to apply pressure to such extent as is necessary to ensure this; that subject to that we prefer to consolidate the air route/route gradually (we have recently been very successful in doing so) and to abstain from adding to our commitments more rapidly or to a greater extent than is really essential. It is, of course, quite conceivable that the whole of tne Trucial Coast may over a period of years go the same way as Qatar - in other words, that if oil is found along it we may have to give guarantees of protection to the Rulers in return for their agreeing to its exploitation by British or semi-British companies; with the closer control of internal affairs which will go with this. But we do not at all want, I think, to commit ourselves at this stage to a policy of bolstering up individuals or regulating successions or the like. 3. The Resident's views are set out in his private letter to me of 21st February. But it would help to round off this correspondence if we could get the observations of the Government of India (after consultation with Colonel Fowle) on the Air Ministry letter of 26th February. We could then circulate the whole correspondence to the Middle 2ast Committee after taking instructions here as to the line to be adopted in any discussion in that Committee.00/ EXTHACT PHOM PERSONAL LETTER PROIv: COLGM&amp;. POWLE TO MR. LAITHWAITE, DATED 21.2.35. Truela1 Policy . Your paragraph 12. Burnett did not send me a copy of his letter to the Air ILinistrj , but Mitchell (Burnett’s successor), who visited me the other day with Humphrys, showea me the document, and said he would let me have a copy which I have not yet received owing to my being on tour. Burnett is a good fellow, and I always got on well with him, but general policy in the Gulf is, as you say, none of his business, and as often occurs when people go outside their own job, he has on this occasion gone quite off the rails. I had a long, and I think satisfactory, conversation with Mitchell, (who is an old friend of mine from Auen days when we conducted a snail war against the Zaidis), on the subject of Burnett's letter. I pointed out the following to Mitchell. (a) That our interestsjon the Trucial Coast were as follows; (1) the protection of lives and property of British subjects. (£) that the Shaikhs should be kept up to their Treaty obligations, including the important one tnat no oil concession should be given without the consent of H.M.G. (3) that tne Air ftoute should run smoothly and safely. With regard to these it was presumably (3) which most concerned the A.O.C(ft) That it was not a case of aftstract principles of * intervention* or non-intervention, ftut of gaining the aftove ends fty the minimum of interference* If we could gain our ends fty this minimum there was obviously no point in going fteyond it, as presumably H.M.G, did not desire to undertake more commitments on the God-forsaken Trucial Coast than was absolutely necessary. If the minimum of interference at any time did not give us our ends I was always prepared to advocate an amount of interference which would achieve our ends. Mitchell seemed to agree and thought that Burnett had misunderstood my despatch (I think myself that it was clear enough). At any discussion which takes place on the subject you might put my views, as summarised aftove, forward, without of course mentioning that I discussed the matter with Mitchell.Extracts from private letters from Mr. Laithwaite to Colonel Fowle, dated 7th February and lst/2nd March 1935, respectively. Burnett has submitted a long series of observations on Truclal policy (which is not really his business) arising out of your despatch making suggestions on that with which the Government of India have concurred, and I fear there nay be some aelay before an answer gets out, because it too, once the Air Ministry and Foreign Office have delivered themselves, will probably have to be considered in the Middle East Committee. I imagine that we here will continue to press for 'gradualness* and for not committing ourselves more deeply than we can help. Trucial Coast. The Air Ministry have now weighed in with an official letter asking that the whole question of policy should be discussed in the Middle East Committee (obviously on the basis of Burnett's despatch - which they have never sent us officially). Many thanks for your private telegram E34 of the 1st. Many thanks also for the very useful statement of your views contained in your private letter. We will take this line in the Middle East discussions. Really all the Air Ministry can reasonably demand is that we should assure them that we are not going to let their air route be interfered with and it seems quite possible to do that without going to the length suggested by Burnett.Tel.

P.Z./7199/34 of the 28th November, 1934, forwarding a copy of despatch No. c/306 dated 16th November, 1934, from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, embodying his views as to the future policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf. 2. The Council note, inter alia, that Colonel Fowle is of * the opinion that ”we should avoid taking on the preventing of hostilities between shaikhs on land 1 ; and that our policy should continue to be one of 'avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast'. In view of tne increasingly active interest that the United States, Japan, Persia and Saudi Arabia are taking„in trade and commerce along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, the Council feel some anxiety lest the passive policy advocated by the Honourable the Political Resident should result in a further lowering of British prestige in the Gulf and thus threaten the security of the air route with which they are deeply concerned. 3. The Air Council feel, therefore, that the time may have come when His Majesty's Government’s age long policy of __ _ „ ^ J non-interference in the internal affairs of the Shaikhdoms should be re-examined with a view to determining whether, in the light of the altered conditions of to-day, it should not be modified to a certain extent.

Other nations are now taking an intereel in the Gulf. The discovery of oil has brought the United States of America upon the* scene, and Japan ie rapidly achieving an important position through the sule of the goods »'hich she cun proauoe so • cheaply. Jhn 'a’ud is no longer a mere spectator, ana should he be allowed to translate hie ambitions into actions, he could well jeapardlse the secirity of our Imperial Air Communications unless we indicated to hiiu quite clearly that we were not prepared to tolerate hiB interference. Purtm rmoie, the recent Persian incidents at » r enjam, Tunb ana ^usidu are indie »tions that our position in the Gull is bein*. questioned in a marmer to which we have not formerly been accustomed. U. It is useless, therefore, to close our eyes to the recent uevelopcmcnta that have been taxing place in the Pex'sian Gulf, and I am ver,* strongly of the opinion that no time should be lost in shaping our future policy to ra&lt;et the new condition©. V our efforts in the past we have attained a position of yiiqueationcd superiority in the Gulf and, with the advent of sir communications, we can not, as a world-wide Kmpire depending more *ru&gt; more uv&gt;on the safe movement of our Civil and ierviee aircraft, afford to ace that position threatened* If we do not maintain our position, some other power may step in anc wrest it from rs, and I co not coiibioer it is too much to »ay that, unless H.k.

Government and the Arab chiefs in the Persian Gulf, British comi&amp;itaentb were purposely left vague. In the treaty with the Shaikh of riweit, tht Shaikh was formally assured of the **goocl office©'* of Uxe British Government, but in 1901 men and guns were landed to protect the town from attack and in 1914 uhe shaikh wac assured that Kuweit was recognised as an Independent principality under British protection. / hen the treatyshen the tre ity was signed with the Hhaikh of Hahrein, he required the British Government to guarantee 31; 5 • i &gt; jot t in aaintainlng the aeeuri i his possessions against agression by the chiefs or tribes in tht OuXf t and since this was a purely naval commitment, it was undertaken* The csee of * use at was difierent and no guarantee or protection against uttacfc by sea was ever given, but in 189t HUM* ^ovemaent oroialsed that whenever there were differences between tne inaitcha of Ottan ana the iultan of i ascat, the former woula not be allowed to attaO. the towns of Muacat 01 ! attrah* .

Ovvevmttmt might have to reconsider this decision* The rest of the 'racial Shaikhs have been guaranteed protection from attack by oca, but no Mention has been mzde of protection from attack by land, except in the case of the Shaikh of Sharjah. hen he was induced to allow ue to build a fortified rest house for the air route it was found necessary to provide him with arms and pay him a subsidy to provide guards to defend the air bane* Thus, while our original unaerttkings to the ^rab ruleie were purposely left vague, we have from time to time been obliged to make them more a«finite an* I conaicer the time has come when a revision of policy would oo much to restore our diminishing presti a in the Gulf. 10* The policy which I recommend should in future be adopted in the lersiun Gulf would normally involve a course of action similar to that adopted by the politic 1 authorities at Pib&amp;l* The a^ib rulers should be responsible for managing their own affairs, but we should let it be Known that ap lon^ as they conduct themselves in a satisfactory manner we are prepared to support their authority and th&amp;il His Majesty's Government will not permit a state of affairs which threatens the security ot her air route or other interests, whether it is due to internal unrest or to the* action oi some other ruler* Vheress ia the past we coula only Intervene through the action of H* . ships in the Gulf, we now have aircraft as well which can be moved rapidly am; easily by means of estublisheu air routes to places where trouble Is anticipated, provi ed those air routes &gt;re secure. v ith a firm policy / of co-operntionof co-opc;ration between the Koyal : ’avy stiO tht l;oyal Air Porce we coalu give » gaurentc e of pi otection to the Ar&amp;b ralere in return for their promise to Bai’e- guaru British intereate.

The Trxcial Coast, which stretches from ^he a s tern aide o: TAT.wR to Cape l ‘ T T D , comprises seven principalitieBf each ruled by an independent ,rab CIiai&lt;h. vrum tiiae to tiuie over a long period of years, the Government of India has negotiated treaties . i th these 3hai&lt;hs, the original intention being to enable Great Britain to intervene to put an end to the constant warfare between them and to stop their piratical and clave trading activities, hater, the Ghailehs undertook to have no de alings vith any other power and not to grant pearling or oil concessions without Great Britain's consent, no s ibsidies see : to have been paid, and until the establishment of the Air Route, the only expenditure incurred in res sect of the r 'racial Coast was the ma* ntenance of a Residency Agent &lt; native) at ' T •• J v* . Or* it Britain’s only committment v as an undertaking to each Shaikh to protect hi . from attack by sea; she consistently avoiaed entimplement in their internal affairs and confined herself to recognising successions (often secured by assassination) subject to the acceptance ay the new shaikh ui the treat,, obligati o ; .s under taken by his predecessor. 5. Last month, when a dispute seemed likely to result in th&lt; murder of the 'haikh oi GJ’A.l, certain steps were taken by the Political author!ties wnieh they claim were in accordance with their policy of non-intervention in Internal affairs. lince, ho»ever, it vas found advisable to send the Political Agent, P-aHIAZ' to aboard one of H.f. warships, to ask lor demonstrations by aircraft and to vivo the ffnaikh a pit sent o* .mis »rvd .nuaunitiou, iuu since it is admit ted that tnese iueusures had n i.,^oi tant effect in a t &gt;holding the prestige of uhs Shaikh and bringing iiavereru to his aiue, the i istlnctiuii between intei vedtion md non-intervention is a very fine one. The reason for ohc action taken on this occasion is that property ana lives oi British subjects were in ©anger, but, as there are probably a fe*. Indian traders in each o: these Gull ports, th .t possibility must have arisen on numerous occasions in the past when no action was taken. 4 . it is considered that the action taken at PI ; Al last month was most advisable and should mark a change in the policy of -rt at Britain towards the Shaikhs of the Trucial Const, for nowadays SI TUI is a refuelling station lor- flying boats and many of the stores for the landplanc station at G” v} JA t? are landed there. bus internal mreet which interfered ith the facilities for aircraft which have been obtained would be a very serious matter. Um The esident, Persian Gulf defines his responsibilities as (a) “Protection of lives .no property of British subjects’.

It is considered th.t oui policy should ensure that *-e can i-ely upon making ise of these facilities. It is by no means only a question of preventing interference with the civil air- route, although as that grows in Importance Its interruption would be a serious matter, but our inability to move either flying boats or land planes along the strategic air route in some emergency might have the most disastrous results for* Great Britain. 6. before the advent of aircraft, the only assistance which could be given to a Ghaikh, unless an expedition was sent from India, was by means of ihe • oyal &gt;r avy and consequently care was taken to limit o.ir commitments to a * uarantee of protection against attack by sea. Aircraft now provide a means by which assistance can be given against attack either by land or by sea unct certain new circumstances have arisen which make a modification of policy desirable. 7. Vhere is always a danger that internal strife in one of the principalities may uemporarily interfere with the air route as in the case of DlbAI last month, when it was considered advisable to warn flying boats not to go there to refuel. There is also the danger of strife between two neighbouring shaikhs, as in January this year, when it was feureu that a dispute between the Shaikhs ol ..Jf-G' anu SthvEJAH might interfere with the civil air route, although this proved to be a veiy small affair which was quickly settled, aircraft were required to stand by in case it developed. It is probable that in the case or internal disturbance in one oi the principalities or in that of a dispute between neighbouring Shaikhs, demonstrations by F. . Gloops and aircraft v-ould usually suffice to settle the trouble and that bombardment would seldom become necessary, ana the k . .0.*s proposed policy of so-called non-intervention might be adequate i* there were no other threat to the safety of the air route. R• 'hen the possibility of establishing an air route along the Arabian const was being examined in 19*:7, the R.P.O. of that ti e was so impressed by the rise of J T ^ r SA^TD’s influence and the insecurity to which a chain of air stations might be exposed*that he recommended that the long established oolicy of abstention from all but naval commitments should be discarded* That recommendation was not adopted, but oince 19f7 IB 7 ’ GA f HD’s power and prestige have increased steadily, ana, with the production of oil in VJIR.J’? and the belief that it exists in HhSA unu in places on the Trucial Coast, his interest in those parts has increased. Toaay, I q? brt’ili) has a powerful influence over the Trucial Shaikhs ana ii is most improbable that they would go counter to his wishes unless they coulo rely upon the protection of the British. This was illustrated daring the past year when the unglo Persian Oil Company wished for an extension ol their concession to prospect for oil in QATAR; at the instigation of JB r Sit’Hb the Shaikh was for some time reluctant to grant an extension and the British Grovcrnment was obliged to consider giving him a guarantee of protection from attack by land as v- ell as by sea.9, At present relations between IT T SA UI) and Great Britain are good and there appears to be little prospect of an open breach, but, vith our present policy of non-intervention, hio influence over the Trucial Shaikhs gives hi?a an excellent opportunity to stir up trouble which would interfere 1 th the air route. If such trouble die arise Great Britain would be forced to intervene to roetore her air communications, and it is therefore suggested that a change of policy is desirable; The Shaikhs should be given to understand that a state of unrest * hich threatens the security oi the air route will not be permitted* It is probable that the Trucial Shaiths woalu au lirst, in principle, resent any interference in their internal affairs by Great Britain in the same ay that they originally objected to the grant of jacilities lor the air route in their territory. They arc now beginning to appreciate the air route ana the mone i y it is bringing to them and it would not be long before they could be persuaded th t any measures taken to safeguard these facilities which they have granted and the incomes which they derive from them would be to their o*.n advantage.

Shaikh Sa^ia hin Miktum, Huler of Dihai, has for some time hah trouble with his cousins, the sons of tne late Shaikhs Hashih ana Buti (see the Genealogical Table in pocket 4 of Volume III of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf by Larimer.) Lately they have become more arrogant in their behaviour towards him and have indulged in vhlence ana looting in Dibai. On the £3rd September 1934 an attempt on his life was planned and it was proposed that on his return from a visit to *Ain Khamir a meeting should be hela to depose him. As the matter was an internal affair, the Shaikh was informed that he as Ruler should deal with his cousins as he thought fit, but that (and this was given out in the town) any persons who caused loss of life or damage to tne property of British subjects would be held to account. Certain steps were taken to encourage shaikh 3 a*id, while not deviating from the policy of H.k.G. of non-interference in the internal affairs of the ShaiEMoms on tne Trucial Coast. H.k.3. Lupin proceeaed to Ditai, aircraft of the R.A.F. flew low over Dibai, the shaikh was openly promised a present of arms and ammunition ana later the Political Agent proceeded to Dibai. Hie Shaikh demanded that his cousins should come to his house and swear an oath that they would obey his rule ana cease from troubling the people, a critical period was the night of the 31st October/ 1st November, when the shaikh gave an ultimatum to his cousins to come to his house or to quit the town by midday on the 1 st November, and brought in bedouin (kanasir) to help him;. Themembers of the A1 bu Falasah (the shaikh‘s sub-tribe) with the h&amp;lp of a local notable, Miharanaci bin Ahmaa, mediated between the Shaikh and his cousins and after prolonged negotiations (from which the Political Agent held carefully aloof) were successful In arranging for a representative of each of the branches of tne cousins to take the required oath. Ihe shaikh expressed himself fully satisfied with the settlement and appeared most grateful for the measure of support which haa been accorded to him. It is too early to form a definite opinion, but it seems probable that our position on tne Trucial Coast has been considerably strengthened by this incident.V The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to y His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India^ Lordo-R, The Air Officer Commanding, British Forroe in T Iraq The Senior Naval Officer, Persian G-ulf, The Political Agent, Bahrain, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment (/).\. ‘ice of the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, camp, Bahrain, the 16th November 1934* From The Honourable Lieut*-Colonel T.C.Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India New Delhi* Subject! Polic y on the Trucial Coast * Sir, With reference to my telegram No *962 of the 6th November, 1934, in which I promised further details as to the settlement between the Shaikh of Dlbai and his cousins* With the assistance of a report supplied by Colonel Loch, who was in charge at Dlbal when the settlement was made, I can give the following summary* With reference to paragraph 6 of my telegram 2 No.896, dated the 24th October j. 934 titrated-the notices finally issued by me took the following forms A* I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins* You should, however ensure that the lives and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger* B* The Honourable the Political Resident who has heard that there is unrest at Dlbai warns all inhabitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British subjects in the Town resulting from any disturbance those responsible for causing such disturbance will be held to account*&lt;' Notice A contained a clear intimation to the 2 Shaikh that he was at liberty to take what measures he liked to deal with those who were endeavouring to depose him| while at the same time reminding him that proper precautions should be taken with regard to British lives and property • The Shaikh was apparently fully alive to his responsibilities in this respect and even before the receipt of the notice had placed guards over the houses of British subjects* Notice B emphasised the fact that in case these lives and property were endangered as a result of any disturbance those responsible for causing the disturbance would be held to account. The causers of the disturbance, though for various reasons I did not name them, were in fact the cousins* 4 # with regard to the causes of the disturbance* For some years past Shaikh Sa^d bin Maktum has had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Shaikhs Rashid and Buti, which culminated in an attest on his life on 23rd September last and a proposal by them, during the Shaikh’s tenporary absence from the town, to summon a mujlis to depose him. On Shaikh Su’id’s return, encouraged by the measures of support, mentioned in paragraph 5 below, accorded to him, he issued an ultimatum to his cousins demanding that they should either come to his house and swear loyalty to him or quit the town* After lengthy negotiations carried on by members of the Al bu Falash' a representative of each branch of the cousins presented themselves at the Shaikh's house and swore the oath demanded# The result of the settlement is that the Shaikh’s position is now stronger than it has been for many years* The Shaikh informed Colonel Loch thut he waswas quite satisfied with the settlement and considered his position now secure* He expressed to Colonel Loch his gratitude for the support which had been accorded him* I think the general result of the Dlbai incident has been, if all goes well, to strengthen our position appreciably along the Trucial Coast* 5* ' Perhaps the most satisfactory fea ture of the settlement between the Jhaikh and his cousins is that it was made by the Shaikh himself with a measure of support from us which was useful to him, for which he is duly grateful, but which in no way involved us in interference in the internal affairs of Dlbai* These measures consisted in the sending of a sloop by the Senior Naval Officer at my request in the first instance with Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan on board, (the Residency Agent himself being unable to leave Sharjah on account of illness), and then with Colonel Loch in charge} a flight of aircraft over Dibai arranged by the Air Officer Commanding, Bagdad, at my proposal; and the promise of a present of arms which I made to the Shaikh and which I ensured should be known throughout tjae T*° w n* In this connection it may be noted that the Shaikh can on production of a 'No objection' certificate from me, import arms whether as a present or on payment* C* As I stated in my telegram quoted above the presence of the sloop and of aircraft had an excellent effed / and the Air Officer Commanding j and I am grateful to the Senior Naval Officer/for their close co-operation* Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan did good work and Colonel Loch on his arrival handled th~ situation effectively*7. The Dlb&amp;l Incident has been closed satisfactorily* It raises| however, in an interesting form the general question of our policy in that part of the Persian Gulf* The recent opening up of the Trucial Coast as part of the Civil and Strategical Air Route, necessitatingthe establishment of an Air Port at Sharjah, end of landing brought us into close contact with that coast, with which until the last few years we were less directly concerned* what our basic responsibilities actually are* These may be classified as follows; (a) The protection of the lives and property of British Indian subjects* It may not be out of place to note here that as far as the commercial interests of these subjects are concerned it must be remembered that we have no Order-in-Council, and therefore we have no legal redress there as in Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait for the claims, for instance, of these subjects against the subjects of a Shaikh. All that can be done in such cases is to ^ try and induce the Shaikh concerned, through the Residency Agent, to force his debtors subjects to satisfy our plaintiff# Such action if successful results as a rule in some kind of compromise between the parties# Where it is not a case of civil claims but of danger to British lives and property in case of disturbance we can of course take a much stronger line and warn the Shaikh concerned of his special responsibilities in this connection* (b) Under our Treaties with the Shaikhs we must prevent hostilities at sea, arms traffic, and the slave trade*trade• We are alao responsible for protecting the Sheikhdoms by sea. In the case of Sharjah, unaer the terms of our ir Port Agreement with the Shaikh, we have to protect him from any form of aggression arising from the air port being situated in his territory# (c) A new responsibility - the safety of the ir Route both for civil and Royal Air Korce aircraft# These are eur actual responsibilities on which we should concentrate. We are not responsible for the enforcement of law and order nor for the stopping of hostilities on land though, as in the past, we can endeavour through the Residency /^gent to conqpose differences between Shaikhs# We should not however, make ourselves responsible for the emorcement of any agreements come to between hhaikhs# we are, under our Treaties, not responsible for the protection of the Shaikhs on land, though doubtless in the case of serious encroachment, or attack by a powerful enemy we should have to assist them# be are not responsible for keeping Shaikhs on their thrones when they can longer keep themselves there# It is obvious that a policy for the Trucial Coast based on the above genraal considerations cannot be an ambitious one, but these considerations are put forward with strict regard to the hard facts of local circumstances. However much at any particular juncture any particular section of a Trucial bhaikhdom, including perhaps the Shaikh himself, for thAir own ends, might welcome our active interference in their domestic afiairs, there would certainly be an opposition party who would bitterly resent it# Moreover, and this is aa most Inportant factor, ary such active intefa'rence wouia sooner or later involve us in supporting such internerence by force. Mhat are the forcible means our disposal V (-) The lanciing 01 an armed party from a sloop. (2) Bombardment £rom the sea. (3) Pombin^; by aircraft* our legitimate responsibilities as set forth in para graph ? above, 1 am convinced that they would certainly not sanction them to support the consequences of some act of interference - however desirable in itself - which had been made in the internal affairs of a 10 . with reference to the air facilities mentioned at the beginning of pcragroah 7 above. The urgent necessity ox ootainiiig these has inevitably dominated our policy on the Crucial Co art for the last five years. Lver since the decision was made to transfer the dU* Route from the Persian to the Arab siae of the Gulf it is hardly an exaggeration to say that no olitical • Officer, whether Resident or otherwise, has been able to visit that coast without being under the trying obligation endeavouring to extract • as painlessly as possible • dir laciiitiee trom some more or less reluctant Shaikh. This reluctance was chiefly based on the fear that the obtaining of air facilities was merely the lirst fitep towards the establishment of British administration over the Shaikhaoms, and the dhaikh of Sharjah, for example, was careful to insert a clause in his ,ir tort /greement that the granting of that port in his territory i no way entitled us to interfere in his internal:-internal affairs. This fear, I trust, the Shaikhs are now beginning to understand is unfounded ( though it is an additional agreement for pursuing a policy of non interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast ) and the facilities in question have been acquired I pm glad to say without the exercise of force, though only after interminable bargainings and negotiations which have left little time for the settlement of other matters. Now that these facilities are actually in being the Shaikhs do not 1 think regret their acquiescence. They appreciate the favourable monetary terms they have received - especially in these hard times, and in certain cases, as at Sharjah, they benefit by a public W/T Station and - shortly I hope - by a Post Office. The Shaikh of Dibai, for instance, has stated more than once that he bitterly regrets his refusal to have the Air Fort at his town. At the same time they - the Shaikhs - for some years past have had to be harassed and hustled, when they know very well - and personally I quite agree with them - that * haste is from the Devil*. Once the question of the Yas Island tank is settled, concerning which Colonel Loch is paying a visit to Abu Dhabi shortly, the last of the air facilities will have been obtained on the Trucial Coast. It will then be possible for my tours, and those of the Political officers under me, to that part of the Gulf to assume the more pleasant complexion of visits undertaken to establish friendly relations with the Arab Rulers, who should now be left in peace to settle down and adapt themselves to the new conditions which the coming of an important air route has brought to their territories. !!• To sum up . The Dibai incident ( par^gra hs 1-6)- 6 - was satisfactorily ^Sttl^d ty a gsnsral policy of laying the responsibility on the Shaikh himself of dealing with internal trouble# He was given a free hand to deal with those who wished to depose him, and at the same time was informed that he should take precautions for the safeguarding of British lives and property# The malcontents were also reminded that they had a special responsibility in this respect# The Shaikh had a measure of support from us which was useful to him, and for which he is grateful, but which in no way involved us in the internal affairs of Dibai# Further incidents on the Trucial Coast elsewhere might mutatis mutandis be dealt with on tie same lines# With regard to our future policy on the Trucial Coast which has been raised by the Dibai incident, we have certain definite responsibilities on that Coast (paragr&amp;pn 1 &gt; which we cannot avoid, and on which we should concentrate# We should avoid taking on new ones (paragraph 8), the most important of which would be the preventing of hostilities between Shaikhs on land, though whenever opportunity occurs we should give our good offices to the Rulers lor the composition of their differences# The main argument for avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast is 1hat sooner or later we would be compelled to support this interference by force, which would be most unadvisable (paragraph 9)# For some years past our policy on the Trucial Coast has been dominated by the urgent necessity of obtaining air facilities from its Shaikhs (paragraph 10), who thoughthough they now appreciate the advantages which they receive in return for granting such facilities - have had to be hustled by us in obtaining them. The facilities in question having been received there will be more opportunities for cultivating personal and friendly relations which the Shaikhs, who should now as far as possible be left in peace to adapt themselves to the new conditions which the establishment of the Air Route has so rapidly brought about in their territory* I would be grateful if the Government of India, should they see fit, would give their general approval of the policy outlined fibove y which can then become a guide for the future* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, the Senior Havel Officer, Persian Gulf, the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in 'Iraq and the Political Agent, Bahrain* I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- T.C.Fowle.

During my recent visit to Ajman I had an opportunity to discuss at some length with the Residency Agent the general situation between the local ruling houses on the Trucial Coast. He told me that it would all be reported in the usual way through the proper political channels. Although it is no concern of ours at present it might easily become so, and as the situation is an interesting one I give here my version of it for what it is worth. The situation today is governed by two new 2 . factors. Firstly the continued collapse of the pearl market following on the recent world wide slump in values. Secondly, particularly in the case of Sharjah, the advent of a new source of revenue for the ruler, namely the Government subsidy for the aerodrome. The revenue which the Shaikh of Dabai draws from his customs and harbour dues is in the same category because it is independent of the pearl market. Hitherto the dhow-owning class were rich men and had no reason to be jealous of their ruler. Now they find themselves poor and their families needy. Being men of influence and standing they do not like this, and consider that they should share, at any rate in these hard times, in the regular incomes which their rulers, to whom many of them are related, enjoy. The rulers do not see it in quite the same light. Therein lies the key to the situation. 3. At Sharjah matters are further complicated by the presence of Abdur Rahman, who since his return from banishment at Aden has installed himself as Sheikh of HairahJ Born to intrigue, his abilities in this respect have in no way decreased of late. By far the most clever man in the swindle he sees himself in the role of ’King Maker’ strictly on the basis of payment for services rendered. He has experience enough to know that this is much less risky, and may be quite as profitable as seeking power on his own account. 4. Recent incidents at Sharjah may point the way the wind is blowing. The late Sheikh of Khan 5 '- Gersh (Jurra’?) bin Ali- had for some time pursued a quietly determined policy of separation. Some three weeks ago he was murdered. The method was quite simple. A messenger from Sharjah drew him aside in his own market on the pretext of conversation - pressing the muzzle of his rifle gently into his ribs he pulled the trigger. The messenger made his escape, went back to the Sheikh of Sharjah and reported what he had done. He was put in prison, and after menacing and angry protests headed by Abdur Rahman (I am not sure of this) Sheikh Sultan ordered him to be shot, which was done. As the story was told me the Sheikh of Sharjah seems to have double crossed his own hired assassin. However, be that as it may, his next move was to instal his most powerfulpowerful brother Muhammad bin Saqar - as the new Sheikh of Khan immediately, and doubly to lock the door by marrying him within 48 hours to niece of the murdered Sheikh! Sheikh Sultan has the reputation of being more greedy than clever, but this little incident might take an honourable place in any catalogue of murderous intrigue. In one , coup t he rids himself of a tiresome separatist, provides a sop for a powerful rival, placates the offended populace by marrying the new man to the old family and public opinion by executing the murderer. Nevertheless public opinion - guided by Abdur Rahman - may not see the thing quite in this light. Sultan is undoubtedly selfish and greedy and is not popular. I am told that we may find in the near future that the Sheikhdom of Khan was but a stepping stone to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah. It remains to be seen whether the next murderer will be double crossed too; 5. At Dabai there are no complications. The Sheikas relatives think they should have a larger share of his regular revenue. Shaikh Sa’id, who 'fchen pearls were paying was poorer than they, thinks otherwise. The Sheikh is concerned for the welfare of his dependants, realising as he does that in the event of any accident befalling him his cousin Mana* bin Rashid might well succeed in place of his own son. 6. At Ajman the Residency Agent thought there was unlikely to be any disturbances. The present Sheikh is a strong man well able to keep order in his own house. He is unlikely to aspire to any of the neighbouring sheikhdoms, and if he did would not be welcomed owing to being of a different tribe. 7. There has been no opportunity to check the accuracy of the facts compilsing this report, and it is requested therefore that it may be read with reserve pending confirmation through political channels.

From Khor Khalba, on the Gulf of Oman, 90 miles south of Has Musandam, for nearly 50 miles to Dibah, the coast of the Gulf of Oman is attributed to the Sheikhdom of Shargah, but is to some extent under the local control of various petty Sheikhs, The capital of the Sheikhdom is on the Persian Gulf side of the Musandam or Ras el Jebel peninsula which runs up to the Strait of Ormuz. The top of the Musandam peninsula from Dibah on its East side to about Sha , am on its West side forms part of the Sultanate of Muscat and is peopled by the Shihuh tribe. From Sha^m for nearly 400 miles to Khor el Odeid at the south eastern end of the peninsula of Qatar the coast, formerly known as the Pirate Coast, of the Persian Gulf belongs to the Trucial Sheikhs who in 1820, after hostilities with the Honourable East India Company, signed a general treaty prescribing peace with the British Government and perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy (specifically including the slave trade) by land and sea. This treaty was followed by further agreements providing for the suppression of the slave trade and for the search and, if necessary, seizure by Briti^i warships of any vessels belonging to the Trucial Sheikhdoms suspected of engaging in this trade, and by a series of other engagements of which the most important are the Perpetual Peace Treaty of May 1853 and the Exclusive Agreement of March, 1892. Under the latter, the Sheikhs on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, undertook that they would on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government, receive foreign agents, or cede sell or give for occupation any part of their territory saveto the British Government* The area of these Sheikhdoms is not defined hut the total population of the six was estimated in 1916 at about 80,000 of whom some 8,000 were | nomads.

In this connection, I would be glad if you could furnish me with a complete list of the various Trucial Sheikhdoms, which would be of considerable assistance to my passport office. 3.

In accordance with Political Residents Message T/33 of 13th February (copy enclosed) on the 14th February I sent ashore an order for the Sheikh of Sharjah to repair on as soon board/as weather moderated. He came on board at 1100 on 15th and was examined concerning the outrage to the British Agent on 31st January. At first Sultan Bin Sagar denied that British Agency had been surrounded at all, but he made capital out of the rumour was that at large in Sharjah (on 31st Jan) that the exiled Ex- Sheikh Khalid Bin Achmed was in the town and admitted sent to Hirah for Abdurahman (his Father-in-law) for armed support. He later admitted that armed men may have collected outside Agency but without his knowledge. After hearing evidence of Isa and Sultan I informed the latter that I was satisfied that Agency had been surrounded by armed men, possibly without Sheikh’s knowledge, but that as he (Sheikh) had guaranteed in writing in December, 1928 the good behaviour of Abdurahman I held him responsible and would report accordingly to P.R. Finally I told him that I would withhold his gun salute for the present until this matter was settled. 7. Immediately after the above interview Hastings with Isa and party on board, sailed for Um-al-Q,wain where the Sheikh Achmed Bin Rashid with son and cousin paid official visit (3 gun salute). X X X X X X X9. As arranged with Political Resident who was embarked in Folkestone, Hastings arrived at Khasab P.M. 15th with Isa on board, for conference with P.R. on the Trucial Coast position. As a result it was decided to request authority to make certain demands to the Sheikh of Sharjah which will be reported separately when confirmed. The same evening arrived news of the murder of a Khoja {British Subject) at Gwadar, and, at the request of P.R. I ordered Folkestone to proceed to Muscat to be at the disposal of the Political Agent, Muscat, as soon as she had transhipped P.R. the following day. 10. After landing Isa at Ras-al-Khaimah on 17th Feb. Hastings proceeded to Henjam. It has been decided that no Sloop shall revisit Sharjah until the time comes for serving demands on the Sheikh. If the suggested Demands are approved, Residency Agent has particularly asked that Hastings shall serve them. I propose accordingly, to remain in southern area provisionally until 21st February - and while Folkestone is detached - to await developments but, if nothing transpires, then to sail direct to Basrah..1 I have the honour to xor^arci herewith for the information of His Majesty’s Government extiacts from a report hy the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gull, on a cruise of the Persian Gulf division along the Tracial Coast from 5th to 10th May 1331. 2 A copy has been sent to the Government Ox India I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J/77 1 ^' Political Resident in the Persian Gull.

The Jenior Naval officer, Commanding Officers and Oeceetary landed during the afternoon to return the call of the Resid ncy Agent, As the lagoon is difficult to navigate we transferred to the Agent's hoat off the entrance. As has 'been re orted on many occasions the lagoon is eminently suitable for use as a refuelling base for filing boats. The oil barge is now moored within a very short distance of the Aesiden- ~cy Agent’s house. It has been reported to me by the Officer Commanding , 205 (P.o.) b^uadron and the Aesiden- -cy gent that the oheikh has lately taken to calling on tne flying boats when they arrive and has actually been with the officers to examine tne barge. The Resi- -aency ^ge-t has purcnasea a suitable skiff to be used for going alongside flying Loats, as the local boats with their pointed prows were always a potential danger to the hulls of the machines. Sheikh Sultan seems therefore to he accomodating himself to the presence of the harge and to the visits of aircraft. He still pro. -fesses consider the whole question as one which is not yet definitely settled, but it is significant that he has requested Isa to ask the Political Resident, to pay him the monthly allowance of 100 Rupees with arrears He maintains five guards to keep watch over the barge hight and day.BAS-AL-KEAIMAH.

While we were ashore with the residency Agent the Sheikh who haa hy that time returned from his opera- -tions in the country, paid a call on the Agent’s house to meet me. He appeared to have some confidence in himself and conversed freely on general topics, his troubles with the Bedouins, the depression in the pearl- -ing industry, the good done by the excellent rains this season and so on* I avoided any discussion on the question of the Royal Air Force barge or on his failyre to call upon H.M.Ships visiting the port, as I thought it best to inspire him with more confidence during this my first meeting with him.

EFFINGHAM sailed from Abadan on the on the 14th December x X X X 58. Sir Bu Naair was Bighted soon after daylight on the 16th December and EFFINGHAM anchored at the south eastern comer of the island at 0845. 59. A few Arab huts were visible on the sandy spit near the anchorage, but these are probably only occupied for the winter fishing. 60. EFFINGHAM sailed for Debai at 0445 on the 17th December and arrived at 0930. TRIAD and FOLKESTONE were already in the anchorage. 61. The Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, A1 Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwain and A1 Hamriyah had arrived at Debai, the only absentee being the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, who had sent a message to say that he was ill. Preceded by the Residency Agent, Khan Bahadur Isa abdul Latif, they came off in their large motor-dhows, accompanied by hordes of retainers, to pay their respects. They were introduced individually to the Commander- in- Chief and subsequently a durbar was held in the Commander-in- Chief’s cabin, when coffee, cigarettes and sweetmeats were dispensed, after which the party was shown round the ship. A torpedo and a full charge round from a 7.5* were fired for their benefit, and minor amusements provided, such as an electric dip and a performance by the band. 62. Before leaving they were again received in turn by the Commander-in-Chief and were presented with cartridges (shot gun), cigarettes, biscuits, etc. 63. In the afternoon the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and staff officers, landed and was received by the assembled Sheikhs. At the ensuing Durbar, opportunity was taken to refer to the alleged ill-healthof the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and to make an offer of medical assistance. The other Shaikhs, however, assured the Commander-in-Chief that they would undertake the necessary cure. 64. After the Durbar, a somewhat disappointing equestrian display was witnessed and, amid further protestations of goodwill and loyalty the Commander-in-Chief returned on board. 65. As the names of these Sheikhs figure so frequently in reports from the East Indies Station, a brief note on individuals mav be of interest:- ■ Debai. An elderly man with a typical Arab face. Takes the lead throughout and is willingly accorded precedence by the others. Abu Dhabi. A much younger man, vivacious and with a marked sense of humour. Sharjah. A young man; stout and immensely strong; a great horseman. Is inclined to be reserved at first but rapidly thaws under geniality. A1 Aiman. Strikingly handsome and obviously proud of his appearance. Wears long ringlets and is well dressed to the point of foppishness. Biblical in appearance. Umm-al-ftaiwain. Large, gross and fat. Has an unpleasant and off-hand manner which suggests mental deficiency. The only Sheikh who appeared to be anything but extremely friendly. A1 Hamriyah. A red-bearded ancient of no marked personality. Inseparable from Umm-al-Qaiwain, whose neighbour he is. 66. The impression given of not only these but practically all Sheikhs met with in the Persian Gulf, is one of extreme physical lassitude, which is doubtless due to excess of sexual intercourse, a form of amusement which is encouraged by the Koran. 9. TRUCIAL COAST. There is very little of interest to report from the Trucial Coast. There have been strong rumours that the British Government were proposing to place the Trucial Sheikhdoms 7Sheikhdoms under the administration of the Sultan of Muscat. This report was firmly believed by the Sheikhs and seemed to be causing them some uneasiness. The Residency Agent is informing them that I know of no foundation for the rumour. «1 Minute Paper.

To sum up:- There are in my humble opinion very serious objections to a civil air route along the Arab littoral, both from the political point of view and from the point of view of the ordinary travelling publio who, after all, must support the service if it is to be maintained. The Persian coast route is certainly the beat route if the requisite permission oan be obtained, and I would suggest for consideration that if the Persian Covernment were approached by all the air companies who intend to use this route and by ary international association that has been established for the furtherance of oivil aviation, they would find it more difficult to refuse them if approached by the Imperial Airways alone. Finally 1 would venture to enquire whether, if the Persian Government are still adamant, the Central Persian route is quite out of the question, having regard to its manifest advantages over the Arab route from the point of view of the ordin r*y travel!* 12 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty's bperetary o~ -&gt;tate for India. I have, etc. (Sd.) H.V.Bisooe,Lt.Colonel Political Beaident in the Persian Gulf and H.B.M's Consul-General for Pars, Khuristan,etcNo, 121/440-3 of 1930. British Residency Consulate-General, Bushire, the 21st August 1930. I have the honour to invite a reference to your despatch No. 267, dated 14th June, 1930, addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, regarding the question of an extension of the 3 years’ permission granted to Imperial Airways to use the Gulf route over Persian territory to India, and to submit certain considerations which have occurred to me in this connection. 2 . In paragraph 10 of that despatch you expressed a belief that it would be in the general interest if the route to India could be transferred from the Persian to the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf. Vhile this would of course solve some difficulties there seem to me to be serious objections to this in other respects. 3 . tfhen I was in London last summer I discussed the matter with various persons who were interested in the project and expressed the view that while there would probably be no particular difficulty about establishing a strategic and military air route down the Arab littoral, a civil air route along this inhospitable coa^ struck me as being a very different matter. iAy m subsequent experience in my present appointment during thethe past year has hut served to confirm the views then expressed. 4. The stages would presumably be Karachi, Muscat, Bahrain and Basrah. The first stage involves a flight of 226 miles across the sea, and'fiuring the summer months this flight would be against a head wind the whole way and over a very rough sea, where a forced landing would probably be attended with disastrous results. It further involves spending one night at Muscat and the second at Bahrain - probably the two hottest places In the Persian Gulf. I doubt whether the ordinary travelling public would be willing to face t&amp;e prospect of a long sea crossing followed by two nights of intense discomfort, except in cases of the most extreme emergency* 5. Again, the section from Bahrain to Basrah would not be practicable unless certain facilities had been accorded by King Ibn Baud for emergency landing grounds, refuelling stations, et 0 -, and hitherto he has shown himself no more accommodating In this respect than the Persians. . Finally, the route would, I calculate, be some 300 miles longer than the route along the Persian Gulf coast, assuming that they crossed the Musandaoi peninsula from Diba to Ras-el-Khaima, and proceeded direct from Sir Bani Yas to Wakra. 6 . Again, from the political point of view thsre seem to be serious objeotickns to utilising the Arab coast route as a civil aviation route. It is an extremely inhospitable part of the world, peopled by ArabsArabs of an extremely primitive type and but little removed from savages, ^hey have already heard of the projected air route and during the recent difficulties at Has-el-Khaima I was given to understand by the leading inhabitants of that place that while they had no objection to visits by military aircraft they would oppose by every means in their power the establishment of a civil air route, and from their own point of view, which comprises the maintenance of their own independence, they would be right. A military air route requires comparatively few facilities and these Arabs knowx it. A civil air route on the other bend requires a muc’ elaborate ground organisation. It involves rest-houses mechanics, hangers, etc., and these in turn involve, t the circumstances at present prevailing, guards for prou 7. Our policy has hitherto been, except in such places as Bahrain and Uusoat, to refrain from all * interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Shaikl and others along the Arab littoral provided they maintaihv the maritime truce* The organization of a military air 1 ?cute would not involve, in my opinion, an' serious ^ departure from this policy, in fact once these Arabs were satisfied that the military air route was not the forerunner of the civil air route I thirik they would place little difficulties in its way. A regular civil air route however would, I think, involve a much largermaamire of interference and a definite departure from the policy up to the present. If we establish this route ourselves it Wtould, 1 imarina, be difficult to de*$r permission to the French, ftitch and other oompanies that wish to fly along it, and their intrusion into this sphere, where foreigners have not hitherto156. hitherto been welcomed, would seem to be undesirable. Further, if a foreign machine has a forced landing on the Persian Coast the responsibility rests with the Persian Goverrxnent and it is not incumbent n the British authorities to render any assistance. On the Arab coast however we hold a special and generally recognised position and the responsibility for rendering assistance in such cases would certainly devolve upon the local British authorities and His Uajesty’s %vy, and I thirflt it might in course of time prove exceedingly burde nsome. 8 # You have expressed the view that the Pors an Goverrmer* have so far shown no inclination to renew the permission granted to the Imperial Airways to fly over Persian territory for three years. 1 would however venture to point out that this route, apart from mmerous private flyers, is used also by the IXitch; they have temporarily suspended their service, but I understand that it is their intention to renew it again next winter. Also from various statements I have seen in the Press 1 understand that the French Air Union are desirous of inaugurating a service to Karachi, with a view ultimately to linking up Indo-China with Prance by air. If this project materialises there will then be three companies utilising this route and it seems to me that while the Persian Goverment might well refuse a request put to them by a British concern alone, they would find it more difficult to refuse a request put to them Jointly by three air companies of different nationalities and that if the British, Dutch, and Fre noh made joint representat ions with ther N tha support of their three Legations the Persian Govorrmert would bo more inolined to grant them the necessary authority They would then realise that the Persian Gulf routs was n t a British monopoly, but was a link in one of the great international highways, and if this request was also supported by one of the international air confederations, it seems to me that it would make it still harded for trbe Persian Governnerrt to refuse it« 9 # The Persian Gsvernnent are apparently still willing to allow the Imperial Airways to fly across Central Persia# This route has hitherto been opposed on technical grounds and as regards these I am not competert to express any opinion. 1 trust however it may not be considered presumptdous of me if 1 venture to point out the advantages of this route from the point of view of the ordin ry traveller. 1 understand that it is proposed, as air traffic develops, to have two lines running from Athene; one Athens-Crete-Egypt-South Africa and one Athens-Cyprus- Beirut-Baghdad-India. If this assumption is correct then the stages from Karachi might suitably be Kerman-Hamadan or Ksrmanshah-Beirut• At each of these stages a traveller would spend a cool night and would avoid the heat of the plains altogether. Hotels and other such amenities could be provided without difficulty and the Journey would be comfortable and, I think, interesting. 10.

Firstly the firm action which has recently been taken at Khassah and the suooeasful outcome of the operations thore f and secondly the fact that it has now h en definitely intimated to these Shaikhs that we do intend to proceed with certain modest measures, lor the establishment of the air route, whether they like it or not. As I have reported in a previous despatch they had undoubtedly got the impression that His k^josty*® Government were no longer prepared, even under great provocation, to impose their will upon them| the Kha^suh incident was being olosely watched oy ail the Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast, and the fact that one of Eis Majesty's ships lay in Khassab harbour for nearly a month before authorisation was received to take action against this rebellious shaikh gave colour to this view. They have now seen th t this view is not correct and that though the patience of the British Government is long, their arm in the last resort is also long. The lesson of Khassab will not, I think, be lost upon them and should do much to strengthen alike the authority of the PoliticalPolitical Hosident and the prestige of His ilajesty’s Nayy in this :art of the world. Again, I pointed out in my despatch N 0 .I 66 -S dated 9th April 1930 that the guest ion of placing a harge at Kas-al-Lhaimah was re^raed as a test case and the Residency Agent bad repeatedly expressed the view to me that if we insists * i tui„ opposition from the other Shaikhs to measures of a similar nature would speedily cease. Now that the ^uaikus been definitely informed that we intend to proceed with this measure, I trust this anticipation will prove to he correct. 4. when I told the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah that we intended to send a barge to his creek he informed me that he could not agree to this measure. I replied uhat j.eL.-ol had been stored in a dhow for over a year in his creek and that no annoyance or injury had resulted from this either to him or from his subjects. To thfs he had nothing to sa* but contented himself with advancing the invariable pre text of the Truoial Shaikhs, namely, that his relatives objected and that he was afraid of them. Finally he asked me ii I would send him a formal letter telling him that the barge was coming, which he could show to his relatives to prove to them that he was acting under force majeure. This I have done and I do not think our action is likely to expose him to any greater danger than he normally lives in. 5 , as regards the visits of aeroplanes to Pibai I found the Shaikh of Pibai quite amenable on the subject.

L H SUBJECT. TRUCIAL COAST. Views of Political Resident on policy to be adopted towards Sheikhs in connection with facilities for the Arab coast air route. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. 2 6 JUN 1930 SEEN POUTICAI COMMITTEE P rein 0 us Tape ra :— We have recently received copies of a number of despatches addressed by the Political Resident to the Government of India, on the subject of the establishment of the Arab air route and of our policy on the Trucial Coast generally. In the light of these Despatches, the Resident, in response to the request made by the Government of India consequent on paragraph 3 of our letter of 20th March (P.1487/30) has also expressed his views on the question of the present arrangements for his transportation in the Persian Gulf. The correspondence, though very interesting, is voluminous. A / precis, with a brief introductory note, is 3997 b •2000 10.29 flagged ’E 1 below. ^.The precis gives the essential factsS L- in the correspondence, which it is unnecessary to summarise separately. It will he seen that Colonel Biscoe, while in favour of using persuasive methods with the Trucial Sheikhs so far as possible, is now satisfied that if we are to obtain our essential requirements in connection with facilities for the air route in the next two years, a stronger line must be taken with them. In these circumstances he has recommended the establishment of a permanent petrol barge at Ras-al-Khaimah, the establishment of a petrol dump on the Island of Beni Yas, and the establishment of a wireless station at Debai, and further, the issue of a warning to the Trucial Sheikhs that H.M.G. intend^* to have their way about facilities for the air route, that our aircraft would continue to visit the Trucial Coast whenever they thought fit, and that the local Rulers would be held responsible that they were not interfered with or molested. The Government of India, in the light of his considered views, have approved the establishment of the petrol barge, but have asked him to take no action as regards either the wireless station (which they are disposed to think might better be situated at Ras-al-Khaimah) or the tank on Beni Yas, pending personal discussion with them during the fri/Zoy , UAASt rn irf fi*! • (mJ ffrn l (V U' Resident's visit to Simla next muiil4*. ,Tr (itfcxA th Gu.

The latter was apparently received better than might have been expected, asst possibly because of the impression created by our handling of the incident 'at Khasab. The Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah made serious wj difficulties about the reception of the petrol barge, but uooordine, to Colonel Despatch of 13th May, displayed/ MinuMinute Paper. Department. 43181! 2000 2.30 air/ displayed a reluctant readiness to accept it if he was given a letter which he could produce to his relatives, showing that his agreement was the result of force majeure. A letter of this nature was ftx'sW given. Since the date of Colonel Despatch, a serious has arisen in connection with the arrival of the barge. A separate submission has been made in respect of this; it has not yet been finally disposed of. It seems clear, however, that hard as it may be on the Sheikh to have his hand forced, H.H. G. , if they intend to secure the facilities they desire, must now definitely apply pressure to him and insist on having their way. For the Sheikh's general attitude in this connection, reference may be made to Colonel Barrett's Despatch of 23rd August 1929 on P.7451/29, flagged. It is relevant that the Sheikhs of Debai, Umm-el-^uawain and Hamriyah, possibly in the light of the warning referred to above, are co-operating with Government, i and have instructed their subjects to refuse supplies j n % to , 4-.. The Resident is no doubt right in imagining that petty Rulers of the level of civilisation of the Trucial Sheikhs are unlikely to understand our policy of moderation, and that a firmer front must now be shown to them. It is to be hoped that he is also right in thinking that if Ras-al-Khaimah is handled with a sufficient degree of firmness, we can hope to secure our demands elsewhere in the Trucial area without much trouble. The matter is now becoming one of some relative urgency. The permission granted by Persia for the use of the South Persianair routes expires in April 1932, and there is yet nothing to show that we can hope for a renewal of the facilities there granted us. The sooner, in these circumstances, the general exploration and plotting out of the alternative route proposed on the Arab littoral can be completed, the better. At the moment we are face with difficulties at several points. We have not yet secured permission from Ibn Saud for landing grounds in Kasa, and there is no immediate prospect of our doing so. The Trucial Sheikhs, as will be seen from the papers now submitted, are hostile and suspicious, and will grant us facilities only under compulsion, while in Muscat, although the Sultan and his Government are friendly and anxious to co-operate, there is the danger of complications with hinterland tribes if the air route follows the course tentatively marked out for it across the base of the Musandim Peninsula. The recent incident at Khasab shows that even along the coast of Muscat opposition may be anticipated, but coastal opposition can be dealt with by the Navy without involving us in undesirable hinterlajid commitments such as will be difficult to avoid if the air route is to run across the base of the Musandim Peninsula, and any question in consequence arises of the application of pressure to the local tribes - particularly at Baraimi. The Trucial Sheikhs are not only one of the most important links in the chain (it is possible, at a pinch to do without landing grounds in Hasa f if sufficiently powerful aeroplanes are employed; Jnlt this is not so in 1 ’ V I the Trucial area, which cover*s ,fit much longer stretch of country), but possibly represent also the point at which it is easiest in the first instance to apply pressure and to secure our demands. We may, however, expect in the future to receive the views of the Government of India on the various i questions of policy in connection with the establishment of/ / ■/ U hJ./U’ liTUn A/* n, 2 MULt* - /**■'’ A 1 uJ JUJ r 4Minute Paper.

Please see in this connection the submission on P.1478/30, flagged below. Colonel Biscoe, in his Despatch of 13th May, makes out a strong case against the adequacy of flying boats as a means of transport for the Trucial Coast, while recognising their value in certain conditions, in other areas. He does not, however, touch on the question of a despatch vessel, and in para.7. of his Despatch rather suggests that the ''Patrick Stewart’ 1 , taken with the facilities afforded by H.M.ships, goes a long way to meet his normal requirements. On this question too we may await the comments of the Government of India, for they will no doubt have discussed transportation as well as other Gulf questions with the Resident in the course of his recent visit. i « 4318kRECENT CORRESPONDENCE BETV/EEN COLONEL BISCOE para.9 of Bushire Desp. 98S of 14.3.30. P.2870/30. AND THE GOVTCgNMENT Off INDIA ON TRUCIAL COAST POLICY AND THE TRUCIAL SECTION OF THE ARAB AIR ROUTE., I. Colonel Barrett T s views. The general question of the future policy of H.M.G. on the Trucial Coast was examined in some detail hy the late Acting Political Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett, in his Despatch No.403 S of 5th September 1929, No.Ill in the Print on P.6796/29, flagged below. His conclusions were generally accepted by the Government of India and H.M.G., and the present Resident (who has independently expressed his agreement with them) has been instructed accordingly. 2. As regards the Arab air route and the action to be taken for its establishment in the Trucial area, Colonel Barrett favoured a policy of moving slowly and endeavouring to secure the friendly co-operation of the Sheikhs. He recognised, however (paras.12 and 15) that if the Sheikhs continued to maintain an obstructive attitude and H.M.G. remained of opinion that the air route must be pushed through, a different policy would be called for, and he recommended that in this event the Trucial Sheikhs should be forced to grant the necessary i facilities. The amount of pressure required should not, he thought, be excessive. II. Colonel Bisooe’s Tour in March 1930 and his conclusions.^ 3. After taking over charge of the Bushire Residency in November 1929, the present Resident, Colonel Biscoe, made a tour of the Trucial Coast in company with the A.0.C.Iraq, with the object, inter alia, of deciding which/which were the most suitable places for landing grounds and petrol dumps in connection with the air route. He reported as follows (Bushire Despatch 98S of 14th March on P.2870,* see especially paras.6-8 and 11):- (a) Ras-al-Khaimah was considered the most suitable t t • , V f r • . k* 9 place alike for flying boats and for land machines, but in certain weather conditions the Debai creek was more suitable for the former. (b) The R.A.F. desired t * ^ ‘ X &gt; iili 1 v' . W • * ' • • : ' • ' ‘ - i ^ (i) to replace their temporary petrol dump in a dhow at Ras-al-Khaimah by an iron barge; (ii) to instal a petrol tank on Sir Beni Yas; (iii) to establish a subsidiary petrol dump at Debai. The Resident stated that the opposition of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah to (i) could, he thought, be surmounted. (ii) could be carried out as originally proposed by Colonel Barrett, without reference to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. (iii) would be investigated with the Residency Agent. (c) The establishment of a wireless station on the Truoial Coast rf is essential for the purposes of the air route and most desirable from the point of view of the Political Authorities^. The Resident recommended that Debai should be induced to ask for the establishment of a regular Post and Telegraph Office by the withdrawal of the postal facilities at present afforded to them by the mail steamers. in.// III. Colonel 21222 Blsooe's supplementary sals, April 1930. (Bushire Despatch Ko.166S, P.2870/30). On the 9th April &gt; the Resident, on the occasion of a protest from the Sheikh of Debai against the landing of a flying boat in his Town, again addressed the (government of India on the policy to be adopted in respect of the air route on the Trucial Coast. His conclusions are briefly that increasing familiarity with the air route had not been accompanied by any increase in the readiness of the Sheikhs about facilities. Possible reasons were that our moderation had been taken for weakness, the delay in deciding finally on the sites for landing grounds, failure to press demands for minor facilities in face of opposition, the reactions of our changed methods in dealing with Persia,.the loss of contact with the Coast owing to the withdrawal of the Resident’s despatch.vessel, and finally misunderstandings by the Sheikhs as to the effect on the.position of H.M.G. of the establishment of the league of nations. 4. Colonel Biscoe stated that he saw no probability of an improvement in the attitude of the Sheikhs, and that strongly as he favoured persuasive methods, he was satisfied that if H.M.G. desired that the requisite facilities should be obtained within the next year or two, the time had now come when a somewhat different line must be taken up. Ras-al-Khaimah was locally regarded as a test case, and the placing there of the iron petrol barge in the immediate future by the R.A.F. would be of importance. In addition to the establishment of the barge the Resident recommended:- (a)/4 (a) the grant of approval to the placing of a petrol \ ; . . t' 7. . tank on Sir Beni Yas (compare para.3 (h) (ii)); (b) that he should be authorised to warn the Sheikhs verbally that we do not intend to refrain in any^ way from flights up and down the Coast; that British aircraft would in future, as in the past, land wherever they thought fit, that any failure to protect them would have grave consequences, and finally that while H.M.Gr. had no intention of interfering with the independence of the Trucial Sheikhs so long as they discharged their Treaty obligations, facilities for the air route were essential, and that if the Sheikhs persisted in their obstructive attitude we should have to abandon t the gentle methods we had hitherto adopted with thou. IV. Action taken by Covernment of India on II and III. (Telegrams to Resident of 21 &amp; 22 April 1930. P.2870 &amp; 2871). 5. The Government of India approved the substitution of an iron petrol barge for the dhcw at Has-al-Khaimah, but asked that no action should be taken as regards the establishment of a tank on Sir Beni Yas, pending the result of events at Khasab and personal discussion with the Resident at Simla in May. Action regarding a wireless station at Debai (3 (b) (iii) above), was similarly to await personal discussion, the Government of India remarking that they were not yet satisfied that Ras-al- Khaimah would not be a better site. V. Cplonel Biscoe 1 ^ Tour of Trucial Coast • in May 19#0. (Bushire Despatch 17T of 13 May. P.3340/30). 6 . In May the Resident made a further tour of the Trucial Coast. He appears to have telegram*Zlf' N fa y+. 0 uluL a corarnunioation to the Sheikhs on the lines proposed dy him in para. 4 (b) above. He reports that it was received by the Sheikhs without serious demur, and that their general demeanour was more friendly than on the occasion of his first visit; the Xhasab incident was, in his view, a contributory factor. At Debai the Sheikh, whose general attitude seems to have been friendly, asked for a letter which could be shown to his relatives regarding visits of aeroplanes to his State. At Ras-al-Khaimah, the Sheikh refused to agree to the location in his State of the petrol barge, but on finding that his protests were unavailing, asked the Resident for a formal letter to be shown to his relatives proving that he was acting under force majeure in the matter. This was given. The question of a tank on Sir Beni Yas was not broached. But, after visiting the Island, the Resident’s view is that the objection of the sheikh of Abu Dhabi to the installation of a petrol tank is unreasonable, and that the measure, if we proceed with it, is unlikely to encounter any opposition. VI. Arrangements for Transportation of Resident. 7. The Resident had separately been asked to report on the arrangements for his transportation in the Gulf. In his Despatch of 13 May he has concentrated on the question of flying boats. His conclusions are that a flying boat is not suitable means of transport for the Trucial Coast where there are no facilities for living ashore, and the chief desideratum is that the visit should be as prolonged as possible, but that for brief visits to Political Officers/Officers in places on the Arab coast it would often prove of great value, provided delay in.obtaining permission from the Persian Authorities for flying boats to call at Bushire could be overcome. • • L i '1 &gt; &gt; i m »•, A /] Hr u 11 /T&gt; I* A/v .US'# ‘' &lt; ’- 'I t o - n i &gt; * o :: *13/T of MCUj Office of the Political President in the Persian Gulf.

They have now seen th t this view is not correct and that though the patience of the British Government is long, their arm in the last resort is also long* The lesson of will not, I think, be lost upon them and should do much to strengthen alike the authority of the Politicalpolitical Hosidcnt and the prestige of His Majesty’s Nayy in this art of tho world* Again, I pointed out in ay despatch Ko*166*fc&gt; dated 9th April 1^30 that the question of placing a harge at %&amp;e-al-Khaimah was regarded as a test case and the Residency Agent had repeatedly expressed the view to me that if we insisted upon this opposition from the other Shaikhs to measures of a similar nature would speedily cease* How that the Shali.us have been definitely informed that we intend to proceed with this measure, I trust this anticipation will prove to he correct* 4. When I told the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah that we intended to send a harge to his oreek he informed me that he could not agree to this measure* I replied that petrol had been stored in a dhow for over a year in his creek and that no annoyance or injury had resulted from this either to him or from his subjects* To th s he had nothing to saji but contented himself with advancing the invariable pre text of the Truoial Shaikhs, namely, that his relatives objected and that he was afraid of them* Finally he asked me if I would send him a formal letter telling him that the barge was coming, which he could show to his to prove to them that he was acting under lorce majeure* This I have done and I do not think ou&lt; ac^i is likely to expose him to any greater danger than he normally lives in* 5 , as regards the visits of aeroplanes to Dibai I found the Shaikh of Dibai quite amenable on the subject* I told him that cars had replaced carts and aeroplanes were replacing cars and that the Truoial Shaikhs must accept this new form of locomotion, which incidently bad been accepted by Ibn Saud himself* He did not demur at2-1^ 4 at all tout asked that raply should to# oomsaunleated to hi* in writing so that h« too could ah w it to his relatives* Me appears to stand in considerstola awe of an elderly cousin who 1 understand wields consider; nle influence in Dltoal and has proved a source of trouble to the Shaikh in the past* I sent for the cousin but unfortunately he was ill. on the other hand i is younger brother f .Shaikh Juma, is an intelligent person as these people go who has trave led extensively f and he warmly supported my views to the 3h&amp;ikh. 1 may mention that the Shaikh of Dltoai has b an most helpful in oonneotion with the settlement of ai’fairs at Khassab. 1 made communloations in a similar sense to the other Shaikhs of this Coast in the course of conversation but, as instructed toy you, did not refer to the question of the petrol tank on Yas Island. 6. As stated above however, 1 visited Yas Island myself. It is^like almost all other Islands in the iersian Gulf, a barren rook rising out oi the sea inhabited by a few fisher folks, some 20 or 50 families who eke out a miserable existence toy fishing for 7 or S months of the year and in the summer send their families to the mainland and go pearling themselves, the village is about 5 miles from the creek and the projected landing ground, and the Residency Agent informed me that when a flying boat oaae there some time ago the attitude of the inhabitants was quite friendly and they brought fish etc. to sell. My visit to the Island has but confirmed my previous vlsw that the objections of the Shaikh of Abu hhatol to the installation of a petrol tank on this Island are unreasonable and that the measure is not likely to encounter any opposition. An occasional trifling present•5- Xjrasent to the Heaciaan of the Tillage will prohahl&gt;' ensure thai, the tank ia not interfered with. 7 # Aa regal'd* the *iUC«tion of using flying boats as a ae&amp;ns of transport* the small Souti*a»pton flying boats at present stationed in tl*s *ulf ftre not reai i. suitable as a of transport for the Resident to ths Truoial Coast ercapt in a tiwe oi eiuergeno&gt; or gx^aTe oriels.

Tor many months of the year he has the •Patrick Stewart* at his disposal and at other times one or other of his Majesty*s ships is generally in the vicinity of the Trucial Coast and he can generally av il himself of the facilities which are so readily placed at his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer.

Your demi-official express letter F. 169-N.|29, dated 21st March. 1 would certainly prefer to have availed my self in the first instance of Hamariyah’s co operation : unfortunately this is not practicable as the Royal Air Force state that facilities at Hamariyah are of no use to them. It is now three years since Trucial Shaikhs were first approached by Haworth, and asked to accord facilities. Since then although they have been repeatedly asked merely to allow the Royal Air Force to rent a building in their towns for The storage of petrol they have one and all refused permission even for this. The Royal Air Force especially desire to store petrol at Ras al Khaimah, and this Shaikh in particular has been approached in the matter, hut has refused his consent. For some months past they have however kept their petrol in a dhow in a creek, and it is now proposed to replace the dhow by an iron barge. In addition the Royal Air Force desire to put' a tank on \ as Island. We have endeavoured to obtain our ends by persuasion for three years, and have only* sought very modest facilities. If 1 felt that a further delay might lead to the 1 rucial Shaikhs’ adopting a less uncompromising atti tude I would certainly advocate a policy ol patience. 1 do not' however think so : on the contrary, 1 think the opposition to the air route is more likely to harden. The Residency Agent has repeatedly written in saying Ras al Khaimah is regarded by the Trucial Shaikhs as the test case, and they are all, waiting to see what' we are going to do there. Tie himself thinks that if We compel Ras al Klmimah to allow Us to store petrol there the others will see that we mean to get our own way in this matter, and will give in. It may seem ridiculous, but* the Trucial Shaikhs have heard of the l eague of Nations and have got the idea that owing to the League the British are no longer in a position to impose their will Upon them. Having therefore waited three years, and having got no further than we were when we started, I feel that the only thing is to insert the thin edge of the wedge, and to proceed to measures to which they cannot reasonably object. One of these measures is the substitution o an iron barge for the dhow for the storage ot petrol at Ra^ al Khaimah and the other is the petrol tank at Yas Island, a barren rock in habited only by a fejsx^ermen.The Under Secretary of State, Coloni^ Office, London, S.W.l. quoted : 79009/30. or mway vvixa p&gt;° /' I arn di/ctsd by Lord PassfieJd to transmit bo you, bo be laid before Mr Secretary Benn, a copy of a despatch with enclosures, from the Resident in the Persian Grulf on the subject of the air route on the Trucial Coast, and to request you to convey to Mr Benn an expression of his regret for the delay which has occurred in forwarding this despatch to the India Oilice. 2.

The Foreign Secretary to the Government of Inaic. , yew Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to report that X proceeded last month on a brief tour of the Trucial Coast on board the I.S.T.3.'Patrick Stew rt', accompanied by Air Vice-X&amp;rshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popha.a, the Air Officer Commanding in Ira a- ■2. I should have preferred to have postponed the tour to a some-what later date, as the 'Patrick Stewart' was required to take King Bin Saud to the meeting with King FAisal during the latter half of the month, and therefore my tour had to be compressed into nine days, which was really too short, especi ally as, at this time of year, one is very liable to get bad weather, and it is frequently not possible to land at any of the ports on this exposed coast. The Air Officer Commanding however could not arrange to come at any time during March or April, and on the whole we were not seriously hampered by_^ bad weather, and were enabled to visit those places i:a which we were most interested in connection with the projected air route. 3. The object of my tour was two-fold: firstly, to make the acquaintance of the Trucial Shaikh*., whom I had not had a previous opportunity of visiting since xy assumption of my present appointment and, secondly, to .decide in consulta tion with the Air Officer Commanding which were the most suitable places for landing grounds and petrol dumps m connection with the air route. a. I exchanged visits with the Shaikhs of Sharjah,Umm-a 1- KawainKav/ain and Has-al-Khainah. The Shaikh of Debai was av/ay on a hawking expedition in Kishm Island, but his two brothers cane off to receive me, and I spent several hours ashore visiting the to*wn, lagoon, etc* Rough weather unfortunatel v prevented my holding com unication ^vlth the shore at Abu Dhabi and A.jman. 5 . As the Government of India are aware the sole means of subsistence of the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast is the pearl trade, eked out by fishing: owing to the scarcity of water and the fact that such as there V^is brackish they can grow no crops of any kind and even the few date trees that appear on the coast line are stunted and yield little fruit. An exception is Ras-si-Khaimah where, owing to springs from the adjacent hills, there are considerable date groves. Merchants have had much difficulty in disposing of their pearls this year owing to the depression of the /estern stock markets, and moreover the catch itself was a poor one, owing probably to the fact that the Banks are being over-fished. The Residency Agent wfro owns two dhows told me that so far from making money this year he had not covered expenses, and I heard similar stories from various other vjeople. There is therefore consequently a good deal of economic distress this year among the inhabitants, though the sea precludes actual starvation. 6. As regards the air route, the Air Officer Commanding came to the conclusion that the most suitable place for a landing ground alike for flying boats and land machines was Ras-al-IChaimahx It has a large creek sheltered in all weathers and an excellent natural landing-ground close by. The Residency Agent has a house there, and for some months past the Royal Air Force have stored petrol in a dhow there which they have hired and which has been moored near the Residency Agent’s house, which is separated from the min town by an arm of the i creek. The Shaikh has never concealed his dislike of this arrangement, but no attempt has been made to interfere with the dhow, and the populace have become used to its presence. It is proposed'1 proposed to replace it by an iron barge, which vail be tov^d down from Basrah when the weather improves and moored ir ‘ aa ie P^ace. The Boyal Air Force will then have a permanent petrol dump there. I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty about the matter; the Shaikh seemed omewhat apprehensive, but as he can inform his relatives that he is yielding to force najeure I do not think he is running any serious risk. The plea invariably advanced by the Trucial Shaikhs if asked to afford facilities for the air route is that “ nS “ dare r ‘ ot do 30 28 they will be murdered by their infuriated relatives if they do, and it must be admitted that they have some grounds for their apprehensions. There are few of them who do not perish ultimately at the hands of their brothers, and the plea that they have agreed to measures which may ultimately lead to a greater measure of British interference is a conven ient excuse for taking action against the Shaikh/one is needed. In the circumstances the simplest course would seem to be not to seek their assent, but at the same time to proceed slowly, and to introduce in the first instance only such measures as they cannot reasonably object to. I t had at flr st been su jgested that Debai would be a good place for a landing-ground, but the Air Officer Commanding came to the conclusion that there were objections alike to the creek and to the proposed aerodrome. I have however since heard from him to the effect that as the Ras-al-Khaimah creek runs parallel with the coast while' the Debai creek runs at right- angles it might in certain weather conditions be preferable to utilize the latter. The Residency Ag'ent resides in winter at Shargah which is only seven miles from Debai, a nd has stored so ther€ for the Air .Force, which can easily be sent 0Yer t0 a6bai if R?0eESar y&gt; but ^ is not likely to become more than an emergency landing-ground. The other place where it is proposed to establish a landing-ground is the island of 3ir Beni Yas. This belongs to Abu Dhabi, and is only inhabited by a few fishermen. Here it is me Proposedproposed ‘to sink in tlie ground s 'tcinic with. &amp; pacilockj sii'ii r to those placed in the ground on the Gaza-Baghdad route, and Colonel Barrett recommended in his despatch ilo. 537-3, dated the pith Hove mb er 1929, that this should be proceeded with without further reference to the Shaikh and X agree* X do not anticipate any difficulty, though it ■'.■/ill probably be desiraole that His je sty f s ships should occasionally visit the island when ohey are on the Trucial Coast. 8. I would emphasise that I think a small subsidy to the Shaikhs cone ^rned would probably tend to reconcile them to any measures that it may be necessary or desirable to adopt. The people on the Trucial Coast are probably the aost poverty stricken of any in the Persian Gulf, even some of the Shaikhs themselves living in absolute penury. They have been told that the air route will bring them .many advantages, but hitherto they have seen its prospective disadvantages from their point of view but have not experienced any of its possible advantages. Occasional presents of a clock or a r/atch mean nothing to them, the Political Resident habitually distributes such presents when tours on the coast, what they want is a small regular payment out of which they would/only benefit themselves but would also appease their re lati ve s . 9. The question of our general policy on the Trucial Coast has been discussed at length by Colonel Barrett in his despatch Ho. 403-S, dated the 5th September 1929, and with his general con clusions I am in agreement. As he has therein pointed out this coast has been sadly neglected for many years past, owing chiefly to the fact that the Resident had no yacht at his disposal. This state of affairs has been to some extent remedied now by the fact that the 'Patrick Stewart' has been placed at the Political Residents disposal for a considerable portion of the year. The arrangement is naturally not as satisfactory as when the R.I.lgS. 'Lawrence' was exclusively at the Residents disposal; the chief * drawback is that the charges for the ship are high and the Resident grant for this purpose, and having consideration to the rate ofthe charges, soiaewhat limited, and therefore he cannot really tour as much as he should do, hut on this point I an addressing the Government of India separately. On the other hand the snip is very suitable for the purpose, the Director, Persian naif Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, is lost ooliging in every way and ready to put the ship at ny disposal whenever required, and the arrangement is of course much more economical than the provision of a special ship. I hope therefore to utilise the'Patrick Stewart' to the fulr extent of the prano allowed to me in the future, and to keep in closer touch with the Trucial Coast than has been possible in the past. liy present intention is to visit the coast again in 13ay, and to spend longer there than was possible on the last occasion. Colonel Barrett has suggested that the Political Agent at 3ah.ra.in should also visit the coast at frequent intervals; this however was on the assumption that the Resident would have a ship at his exclusive disposal all the year round which is not one case; secondly, X do not think the Political &gt;^gent at Bahraiii could spare the time. The work at Bahrain, as I am bringing to the notice of the Government of India in another connection, is increasing very rapidly, and it is now much the most one-i. ous post in the Gulf, while if an Oil Company establishes itself there the labours of the Political Agent will be still further inc reased • 10, One great obstacle to adequate supervision of affairs on the Trucial Coast is the difficulty of communication with the Residency Agent. The only means are by the slow mail which calls at Debai once a fortnight, or by messages sent through His Ua.jesty^ ships who visit the coast from time to time. An obvious desideratW* alike in the interests of the Air and of the Political authorities i^ the establishment of a wireless station at Debai or Shargah. As pointed out by Colonel Barrett the erection of a wireless station formed part of the ultimatum to the Shaikh of Debai at the time of the 'Hyacinth' incident in 19il, but it has since been allowed to lapse. Debai however as a large mercantile co imunity, and especially during thethe pearling season these merchants and also these who come to Debai to buy pearls have occasion to send numerous telegrams to Bombay and elsewhere. At present they utilise the fortnightly mail steamer extensively for the purpose, and whenever the mail steamer comes in a large number of telegrams are sent off to it, especially of course at the conclusion of the pearling season; further, the local agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company at Debai, an Indian, maintains a kind of informal post office there: that is to say he sells stamps, accepts letters and sends them off in a sealed bag to the steamer where they are posted on board. I am inclined to think that, if all these facilities were denied to the inhabitants of this port, it is probable thetjthe mercantile co t unity would very soon clamour for them, and might bring pressure to betr on the Shaikh to make some arrangement to regain for them the facili ties which they had lost. If therefore the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government agree in principle with the desir ability of the establishment of wireless and postal facilities on this coast, and would be prepared to grant such facilities if the opposition of the Shaikh could be overcome. I would suggest that the British India Steam Navigation Company should be asked to prohibit their agent on shore from accepting any letters from the general public, and the Captains of the ships should be instructed to take steps to prevent any letters being posted on board at Debai, or any telegrams being accepted for transmission from there: as regards,this letter it would, I understand, be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Marconi Company. I believe the general rule is that telegrams cannot be sent from a ship while lying in a port, and there seems to be no reason why this rule should not be made applicable to Debai. The Captains could be allowed to exercise their dis cretion in the case of telegrams sent by bona fide passengers. If these measures were introduced from July next it is not improbable that the general public would so dh ask for the establishment of an Indian post office and a wireless station. TelegramsTelegrams could be sent by dhow to Bahrain, but this would be slow, costly and uncertain! and though it would be too much to expect tnat these neasures would lead to a direct request by the Shaikh for a wireless station, it is ‘possible that he would evince much less reluctance to agree to one if ci certain amount of inconvenienee had been caused to the in habitants of his town by the cutting off of all telegraphic communication with the outside world. If a commercial wireless station were once established there would probably be much less difficulty in arranging subsequently for the establishment of suosidiary stations renuired by the Royal Air Force. If I could be informed before I visit the Trucial Coast in May whether the Government of India approve of this suggestion, I could then notify the Shaikh of Debai on the occasion of my next visit that it mil no longer be possible for ships tortake letters from or accept telegrams at Debai. 11• To sura ups V ; out; n uysn. containing petrol at Has-al-Khaima^, and to instal a petrol tank on Sir Beni Yas, and to have a subsidiary petrol dump at Debai. I see no objection to the first two measures, and petrol for their use is at present stored by the Residency Agent at Shargah, seven -Ues from Bebai. I have written to ask him whether he can arrange for a small quantity to be stored at Debai itjlf in the vicinity of the creek. (ii) the establishment of a wireless station on the Trucial Coast is essential for the purposes of the air route and most desirable from the point of view of the political authorities. At present the people of Debai utilise the mail steamers extensively for despatching both letters and telegrams, especially during the pearling season. I suggest that measures should be taken to prevent their doing this, so that they may be induced to ask for the estab lishment of a regular post and telegraph office. I have the honour tot Sir, Your most obedient servsCopy of letter Ho. 166-3? dated the 9th April 1930» from the^Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. • » • • I have the honour to invite a reference to my despatch Ho# 98-S of the 14th March giving a brief account of a tour I undertook to the Trucial Co'ast in February. In paragraph 6 I summarised the present posi tion regarding the Arab air route and mentioned that Has-al-Khaimah was considered the most suitable place alike for flying boats and for land machines but that in certain weather conditions the Dibai creek v/as more suit able for the former. 2. As the Government of India are aware flying boats have several times during the last twelve lonths done trips to Karachi and Muscat and have on each occasion refuelled on the Trucial Coast, sometimes at Ras-al- Khaimah and sometimes at Dibai. On no occasion have they encountered any hostility from the general populace wmo, on the contrary, appear to regard the arrival of a machine capable of flying in the air as an interesting event in their somewhat monotonous lives, though the Shaikhs con cerned have steadily refused to accord any facilities. The last flight occurred early in March, and in the course of it a flying boat landed at Dibai. This landing has led to a protest from the Shaikh of which I forward a transla tion for the information of the Government of India to gether with a translation of a letter from the Residency Agency forwarding it. This is, I think, the first occas ion on which any Shaikh has formally protested against the visit of an aeroplane to his town. 3. In view of this, I think the time has now come when it is necessary to decide definitely on the policy which we propose to adopt regarding the air route on the Trucial Coast. It is now three years since SirLionel Haworth first broached the topic of facilities for aeroplanes on the Trucial Coast and various requests have made * to the different Shaikhs at different times in this connection, These requests have been of the 'lost modest nature and hitherto all that the Royal Air Force have asked for is that they should be allowed to rent a shop or a godown at one or two places v/here they could store petrol. They have not so far sought any facilities for wireless or concessions for land but have merely asked for a privilege which would be opcorded without question to any Indian trader on this coast. For three years the Trucial Shaikhs have refused this exceedingly moderate request and no steps have been taken to enforce it. 4. I cannot help feeling that it was perhaps a mistake to adopt towards these petty Shaikhs so suppliant an attitude in the first instance. Our motives however were of the best, and there was a prospect that this method might prove successful. It was the desire, and, I believe, still is the desire, of the Royal Air Force to obtain the facilities which they require if possible with the co-operation and friendly assistance of the Shaikhs concerned and it was believed that, as they became more famildar with the presence of aeroplanes and began to realise the advantages which would accrue to them through the air route, any hesitation they might feel at first about according facili ties would disappear. 5. Unfortunately these hopes have not been realised, and the que st ion therefore arises whe the r we shouId pe rsi st in these methods or adopt a stronger and more definite line. If I felt there was any likelihood of the method of persuasion being ultimately, successful, I would certainly advocate its continu ance. I do not think, however, that there is the least prospect of this, and if His Majesty's Government desire that the requi site facilities should be obtained within the next ye^r or two ' then I am convinced that the time has come when a somewhat different line must be taken up, and the letter from the Shaikh of Dibai affords a convenient opening for inaugurating it.o. There are various causes which have contributed to the failure of the present methods- Firstly, there was some hesitation at first in deciding which were the most suitable places at which to establish landing-grounds, and it is only recently that a definite decision has been arrived at on this subject. As a result facilities have first been asked for at . i* 1 ;. place a iid ^nen at another and no definite steps have been ta±cen to obtain them anywhere except that the Residency iv;ent has stored some petrol in his own godown at Shargah, and a dhow containing petrol has been moored in the creek at Ras-al- 111 aina n. The result has been that the attitude of the British Government has been completely lisunderstood by these primitive and bigoted Shaikhs, .and they have undoubtedly now-a-days a totally erroneous conception of the power and readiness, in the last resort, of the British Government to enforce its demands. Secondly, ridiculous as it may seem, the Residency Agent infor med me recently that they have heard accounts of the League of nations wliich they had gathered was some super- government of whom the British Government were afraid and which would no xonger permit the latter to adopt, in future, the methods which it hc*d ad opt a u in the past. Thirdly, thase views have been strengthened by events on the Persian Coast. They have seen that the 3 riti sh Government no longer adopts towards the Persian Gcvern.xnt the line they adopted formerly. Such instan ces as that of the treatment accorded to the Sheikh of Ifohammer ah: the refusal of the Persian authorities to recognise Britiaa passports issued to Bahrainis and others: their refusal to ow.it tne nationality of Bahrain subjects at Moha iwerah and elsewhere: the Tanb incident: all these have created an impress ion on the minds of the pri litive Arabs on th£ Opposite coast that the British Government are no longer as powerful now as formerly. Finally must, be added the fact that the Resident has for some year^been deprived of his despatch vessel and has, m consequence, seldom been able to visit them and when he did111 so it was in a British India steamer or some other means of transport lacking that dignity with which his visits were i orrnerly associated* is Colonel Barrett mentioned in one of his despatches* the last Re silent * s name who is knov/n to these people is that of 'Cotf us”. r . ^o revert now to t he' ii-mediate issue. Although, as explained above, tor some time past there has been some hesitancy as to one exac b taci?Lities to be demanded it has alivag^s been realised that a very suitable place-if not necessarily the most suitable i oul ■. 1 - - r n ha ima h and greater e p has is h s c on se (^uen tlv oeen laid upon taciiities there than elsewhere and the Residency -vgent in almost every letter he has addressed to me during the past six months has stressed the fact that Ras-al-Kh&amp;imah is regardeo. popularly as a test case. He reiterated this view to me personally last Rebtuary and it will be seen that he has given x resh expression to it in the letter of which a translation is enclosed and he is convinced that, if we enforce our will at this place, opposition elsewhere will speedily cease. I see no reason to doubt the correctness of this view. The Royal Air Rorce- as men tinned in my despatch reierred to above-propose to place a-n iron barge at Rr s-a 1-rhaimah next month to replace the existing dnow ir which petrol is stored: I expect to be on the '’racial Coast nyself when the b rge arrives, and during -y las' visit I informed the Snsikh th t it would probably be ccmir • scon. If f'-iz is iollowed by the placing of a petrol tank on Yt s Island I trust we shall at length have inserted the thin edge of a wedge which - ..ill ultim tely oo^ain for us the f acilites which we require. I nope therefore tfm.t approval will he given to the latter measure. * These actions will go some way towards showing the ^rucial Snaiahs ttui-i/ we intend to have our own way in the end, but this might, I think, be further exphasised. I do not eonsider it necess ary to send any Immediate reply to the Shaikh of Dibai’s letter, _s I shall oe leaving for the 'rucial Coast myself on tour on 5th I ay in the 'Pa trie:: Stewart'. But if the views adumbrated above areK .A' ' \ Vi are approved then I suggest that I should be authorised to inform the Shaikh verbally that we # do not intend to refrain in any way from flights up and down the coast, and that British aircraft will land wherever seems to the! good, and that any failure to protect them by him or any other Shaikh will meet with the gravest displeasure of Government \ which they will not hesitate to express. Further I might add that, while we have no desire to interfere with their indepen dence or their domestic concerns, so long as they fulfil their treaty obligations, it is necessary for us in our own interests to provide certain facilities for our aer.planes which have to traverse their territories; that we have hitherto endeavoured to obtain these facilities through the friendly co- 'peration of the Shaikhs but that our action appears to have been ds- understocd, and warn him seriously that if the obstructive attitude taken up by the Shaikhs is persisted in, we shall have to adopt a different line. 9. The compensation recently paid in connection with the Tanb incident will prove a most valuable argument. These Shaikhs cannot have it both ways if they expect us to stand up for their rights vis-a -vis the Persians then they .mist meet us half way when we need their co-operation. And in this cocnecti-. I would u£ntion that T earnestly hope that when the present negotiations with Psrsiaj^re concluded tt will be possible to remove some of tne difficulties to wk ich Arabs are subjected at Persian hands: such action would, I believe, enormously enhance our prestige on the Arab coast, and remove a constant grievance against us. 10 . If these views commend themselves to the Government of India and His : eg e sty’s Government, I would request W* t, id possible, I :my be. informed by the 4th Hay as on that' date I intend to start on my tour fox' the Truciel Coast. 11.

After Compliments, I beg to state on the 5th Larch 1930, I went in company with the Captain of H.T .S. Cyclamen, to 3ukha and from there to Khasa-b. lie informed me that he received a tele gram asking him to inform me of the arrival oi the aeroplane 'at Debai and Ras-ul-Khaimah on the 8th Larch 19 30. I asked him to inform you that I was with him on board the man-ox -war at Khasab* I have the honour to report that the aeroplane arrived on the 7th Larch 1930 at Debai. K.3. -' unshi Huso in oin Kasan who was present there at once went to the creek and called on her Commander. Tne latter enquired from him about the Shaikh of Debai and the liunshi informed him that the Sheikh was sick and did not come out of his house. At the same time the inhabitants of Debai and the Bedouin collected on the sea shore opposite the aeroplane and afterwards Sheikh Jumah bin lakturn and the son of the Shaikh of Debai appeared on the spot and the Redawis of the Ruler of Debai riding their horses tried to disoerse the people from there. After that Sheikh Jumah oin : aktum went in his boat to the aeroplane and interviewed her Commander in the aeroplane. The Commander told Saeikh Jumah that he desired to interview his brother Shaikh Said. Tne Shaikh informed the Commander that his brother was sick and could not come out of his house, and that he was sent oy his brother(Shaikh Said) to desperse the Bedouin and others ana to prevent them from crowding about the aeroplane so that nothing s iiould nappe n. The Commander asked Shaikh Ju a to permit aim to land on the shore opposite the aeroplane and to wmln foi half an hour and then return. Shaikh Juma replied that onaccount of the crowding of the people he could not per lit them to land without having consulted his brother Shaikh Said bin ^4:aktum and the notables of the people. Thereupon the Commander '\Jaid to Shaikh Juma that he would go to Has-tTl-Khaimah, the Shaikh therefore landed from the aeroplane and the Commander took K.S. Husain bin Hasan with him and flew to Ras-ul-Khaimah. They reached Ras-ul-Khaimah at 8 C , clock(2.p.m) alighted at the creek there, spent the night in my house and left for Mus cat tlie next morning. I have the honour to state that the non-agreement of the people of .Debai to the landing of aeroplanes in the creeks of Debai and their refusal to give a place for storing petrol are all due to the attitude of the Ruler of Ras-ul-Khaimah. ^hese individuals seeing that the british Government have not taken notice of the refusal of the Ruler and citizens of Ras-ul-Khaimah and nothing has since been done to them, all oppose by offering refusal. In my humble opinion no sooner a thing is done to the Shaikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah in regard to petrol all the other Rulers ana citizens of the Crucial Coast will obey in everything. Decision rests with you. Ch the 10th march 1930 the aeroplane returned from Kuscat to Ras-ul-Khaimah with Said bin Amir messenger of the Sultanas Council of linisters who travelled in her to Khasab in connection with the refusal of the Shaikh of Khasab to permit officers of the man-of-war 'Ormonde’* travelling to the mountains.

The Foreigi Office, Colonial Office and Air Ministry concur in the course of action approved on that paper. Ihe Air Ministry have, however, raised a minor question in connection with the methods of transportatior of the Resident.

This in fact represents a compromise. The India Office representatives on the Committee had recommended that the Report on this point should run as follows:- 'We suggest, indeed, that he should normally move by air, and that the Air Ministry should arrange accordingly.' The Air Ministry were not prepared to accept this suggestion, on the ground that they had not, and could not for some considerable time hope to have, sufficient aeroplanes in *hich to transport the Resident. 3 The Admiralty, who are seriously concerned at the Air Ministry suggestion, which they regard as the thin end of the wedge in an endeavour to oust the Navy from the Gulf, have let me see privately certain correspondence which has passed between them and the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, and the SeniorI Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, on the question of the suitability of flying boats for general use in the Gulf. The correspondence will be found in an envelope below the Air Ministry letter. It seems clear from it that there are fcartain substantial objections to the exclusive use of flying boats, and on the vhole, despite the expense involved, I am still inclined to think that there is a great deal to be said for giving the Resident, for his own use and that of the Political Agents in the Gulf, some form of small despatch vessel, which would be at his sole disposal, and which could be used to supplement the' sloops and the flying boats as methods of locomotion. But we shall, I think, do best to put the Air Ministry suggestion to the Government of India (with a brief explanation as to the actual recommendation of the Warren Fisher Committee) and ask them for their views ancj those of the Resident. Colonel Biscoe will probably by now have formed a definite opinion as to the methods of transportation best adapted to enable the Resident to perform his duties.

Please see the print of correspondence on the question of future policy on the Trucial Coast on P. 6796/29 below. The introductory note records the developments leading up to the comprehensive review submitted in Colonel Barrett’s despatch No. 403-S of the 5th AWgaee, 1929 (P. 6406/29 - Item No. 3 in the print), the conclusions of which are generally accepted by the Government of India in their telegram of the 22nd October on P. 6796, printed as Enclosure 4. The remarks in Colonel Barrett’s despatch are supplemented bw his letter of the 23rd August on P. 7451/29, recently received, of which a spare copy is put up, but which has not yet been circulated to the Imperial Departments. £-x\ction on the paper has been held up for some time, partly because the question is to some extent connected with that of the transfer of the Residency, on which we have had no correspondence so far with any Department except the Foreiga Office - and even that only demi-official. On the principal point of an urgent nature discussed in it - viz . , the appointment of i a full-time Political Officer on the Trucial Coast - it was possible to explain d.o. to the Air Ministry (who had circulated the memorandum flagged K below to the Warren Fisher Committee) the arguments against adduced by Colonel Barrett, and supported by the Government* of India, with the result that they were prepared to let matters rest as they were for the moment. ^ The correspondence speaks for itself. On the broad question of policy the Department is in complete agreement with the views of the Acting Political Resident which, as will be seen, are accepted by the Government/Government of India. It is ^utSarTiiat we cannot put an end to the system of succession by murder, which is deopljy rooted in the Trucial area, without undertaking a much larger degree of responsibility for the internal administration of these States, with the serious commitmelnts which this would involve. On the broad principle that it undesirable (unless we are driven to it by the needs of the air route) to increase our commitments on the mainlan|d, and particularly in the Trucial area, the Department agrees entirely with the Acting Political Resident and th Government of India. Colonel Barrett's despatch of the 5th toogaab and his letter of the 23rd August make it quit|e clear that any attempt to increase our local control woul meet with determined opposition from the Sheikhs, and that we are likely to have considerable difficulty in securing even the relatively minor facilities which we require in connection with the Arab air route. The history of the question of British representation on the Trucial Coast from 1902 to 1912 is given in the Departmental note flagged H. Its subsequent history is covered by Colonel Barrett's despatch. Colone Barrett's arguments against the im media te appointment of an officer to reside on the coast - unless this should be rendered inevitable by the urgent demands of the air rout 4 - are conclusive. It will be seen that the Government of India are not satisfied that the development of the air service will in fact necessitate the establishment of an * Agency here. Cn the whole, the Department is inclined to think that it would be better to postpone judgment on this question until a decision has been reached as to the location of the Residency, and the administrative reorganisation which must accompany any move from BushireMinute Paper. political Department. leaving it to the Political Resident then to report whether in his view responsibility for the Trucial Coast can adequately be discharged by the Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrein, between them, or whether the establishment of an Agency at Rabai is desirable. Xt the same time, in view of the degree of opposition vjhich is apparently being experienced from some of the Trucial Sheikhs, and particularly from Ras-al-Khaimah, in connection with the establishment of refuelling bases, it would, I think, be well to take what steps we can to keep in closer touch with the Trucial Coast, with a view to familiarising the Sheikhs with visits from British officers, and making it clear to them that we are in a position, if necessary, to interfere effectively in pursuance of our interests. Action to the full extent suggested by Colonel Barrett m paragraphs 14 and 15 of his despatch of 5th September is hardly possible without a despatch vessel, but the Government of India could be asked to take the point with the Resident and leave it to his discretion to make the best arrangements he can. 5. As regards the Residency Agent, we are clearly fortunate in having a representative such as Isa, who has a long tradition of service to Government, and who, on the whole, appears to have done very valuable work. The disadvantages referred to m paragraphs 8 and 9 of Colonel Barrett’s despatch are probably inseparable from the employment of an Arab, and, even assuming that all the allegations against the Residency Agent are well founded, I do not see that we can take any steps at this stage to deal with them. On a minor point, it may be remarked that the'Agent has recently/recently been given a sumptuary allowance of Rs.60 per mensem, in addition to his pay of Rs.150 per mensem. 6 . The correspondence illustrates the extent to which the Resident is hampered by the absence of a despatch vessel. Evidence of this has been accumulating (see the reports on P. 5544/29 and P. 3838/29 from Colone 1 Barrett and Sir F. Johnston), and for an area such as the Trucial Coast a ship is more useful than a flying boat. Colonel Biscoe will no doubt take the matter up with the Government of India before long: but we might, I suggest, in the reply to be sent to the correspondence now submitted ask the Government of India whether in the light of the reports submitted by recent Residents they regard existing arrangements for the transportation of the Resident as satisfactory, and if not, what suggestion they have to make. 7. I submit letters to the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and Air Ministry proposing, subject to their concurrence, to inform the Government of India that His i Majesty’s Government are in general agreement with their conclusions on the question of future policy, and dealing with the question of a Political Agent on the Trucial Coast on the lines suggested in paragraph^ above.Draft Paper. political Department.

The question of the appointment of a Political Agent on the Trucial Coast is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 below. On the other points raised by the present correspondence, the Secretary of State is m general agreement with the views summarised in paragraph 17 of Colonel Barrett’s despatch of the 5th Aagvagt. As will be seen from Enclosure 4 to the India Office Memorandum, those views are also accepted m their broad outlines by the Government of India. Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of SecretaryoT Air Council, Ltate for Foreign Affair s, of ths for the Uoionieg. of the and of tne i'oreiyi Office and Colonial iiir Ijinistry and Colonial off inn ™ce n ° ffl Ce ^ Air :!lnisirv ‘' to whom similar letters are being v addressed/4 addressed, the Secretary of State proposes to inform the Government o India that His Majesty’s Government accept generally their conclusions on the question of future policy. 3. The question of the establishment of a Political Agent at Dabai is one of some difficulty. After very careful consideration of the discussion of this question in the correspondence now forwarded, Mr. Benn agrees with Colonel Barrett and the Government of India that, unless a different policy should be forced upon His Majesty’s Government' by the urgent demands of the Arab an route, no immediate action should be taken in this direction. The arguments set out by Colonel Barrett in support of this recommendation are, in the Secretary of State's view, conclusive: but a further objoe 4 ^on ^xi-s-ts to rem-fe-roe 'them in the fact that, as Mr , Henderson is rd ^assfield is the Air Council are aware, the possibility of transferring the Persian Gulf Residency from Bushire to the Arab side of the Gul: is under tmtew consideration. The establishment of an Agency at Dabai must clearly be considered in relation to the reorganisation ofpolitical Department. Gulf v/hich is likely to accompany any removal of the Residency from the Persian littoral, and it is possible, as the Government of India suggest, that, should it be decided to transfer the headquarters of the Resident to Bahrein, the necessary degree of supervision of the Trucial Coast could be provided by the Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrein, between them. 4. \tiile, however, the Secretary of State is not in favour of taking steps at this stage to provide for British representation on the Trucial Coast, he is inclined to think, in the light of the correspondence now forwarded, that itj will be desirable to take such steps as are possible to keep in closer touch with the Trucial Coast and to fai'niliarise the Sheikhs to a greater extent with visits from British officers and with the reality of British control in the Gulf. Action to the full extent suggested in paragraphs 14 and 15 of Colonel Barrett’s despatch of 5 th September is hardly possible in the absence of a despatch vessel: but the Secretary of State, subject to any observations which Mr. Henderson Lord Passfield tne Air Council may/I'M. may wish to offer, would propose, communicating the decision suggested in paragraph 3 above as regards British representation, to ask the Government of India to instruct the Political Resident to take at his brCL &gt;;c~J ' discretion such action as ne can/with the means of transport now available. t 5.

Correspondence between the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1929). to Introductory Notk. 1. The developments affecting the position of 1 lis Majesty’s Government on the Trucial Coast in the period 1908-28 and the question of the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in that area are dealt with in the India Office Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs, reprinted on pages 87-94 of P.G. 13. The position of the Sheikhdom of El Qatr is dealt with in the Memorandum on pages 95 and 96 of that paper. 2. Subsequent to the publication of P.G. 13, the question of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Trucial Chiefs and Qatr came under the consideration of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Sub-Committee, after considering memoranda on the subject by the Colonial Office and the India Office (papers Nos. P.G. 22 and P.G. 26), decided, at their meeting on the 19th November 1928, “ to adopt the conclusions set forth in paper No. P.G. 22, para. 6, namely, that ‘our present position on the Trucial Coast is sufficient to protect essential British interests; that we should endeavour to maintain the independence of the Trucial Chiefs, and should not allow our present position in regard to them to be weakened in any way ; that we should rely upon our existing treaty rights to secure this end, and that it is not desirable at present to incur the further commitments that would be involved in the conclusion of regular protectorate treaties.’ ” 3. Since the date of this conclusion, the general question of policy has, however, again been raised in the correspondence reprinted below. Sir Frederick Johnston, on assuming the charge of the Persian Gulf Besidency at the end of 1928, remarked in the despatch printed as No. T below, that it was for consideration whether a review of the Trucial Coast policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to actual conditions and needs was not called for. He suggested that certain tentative proposals made by him to this end might be considered, together with the position as a whole, by his successor, Colonel Barrett, “ who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral.” Colonel Barrett’s report is printed as No. 111. The views on it of the Government of India will be found in the Viceroy’s telegram of 22nd October 1929, reprinted as No. 1 V. India Office, J. G. L. 23rd October 1929. P. 3840/29. I.

Johnston, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secrelanj to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, gj r Bushire, 23rd April 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 58 N\, dated 13th June 1928,* to which you have just called attention in your letter No. F. 58 N./28,' :;: ' of the 9th April 1929. 2. The suggestions for checking the series of murders in the Shaikh family of Abu Dhabi emanated from my predecessor, who apparently found the practical imposition of any remedy to be impossible without the assumption of a very much greater amount of internal control than is consistent with His Majesty’s Government’s policy on the Trucial Coast, and, I am informed, delayed his reply in the hope that the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence would result in the policy of a greater degree of interference in the Trucial Coast internal affairs. * Not printed.* P. 4575 27, not printed; but see P.G. 13, page 89, paras. 14 and 15. 9 3. History will, I think, show few societies which have not passed through the stage of the' assumption of power by murder. That it is inhuman everyone will admit, but there are many things going on on the Arab coast that are much more inhuman, and the murder of a Shaikh is only a symptom of a primitive state ol ar uns from which development must be gradual and which cannot be alteied by the meie suppression of that symptom. Though there may be possibly some sympathy foi the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for his successors in the blood-stained line. They know exactly the contract they are taking on. As a matter of policy the results of interference in successions are very clearly set forth in para. 3 of Despatch No. 13 of 1927, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India. 1 ' If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions ot thought throughout the woild, and the only hope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and the advantages of social stability. So long as these violent changes do not affect the lives and security of Biitish subjects, I fail to see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of view of an alien school of thought. 4. As regards the wider question of our general policy on the Arabian side, I feel that with the short period of my tenure here and the small opportunity I have had, owing to difficulties of transport, of studying on the spot the problems existing there, anv views 1 express can only be of value as the result of the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of administration under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan frontier. Such experience as I have obtained of our dealings with the Trucial Chiefs leads me to think that possibly both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, and that there is a complete absence of real political touch. The political duties on the Trucial Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself on Arab, and as such liable to Arab intrigues and partisanship. He lives at Shargah, some 8 miles from Dabai, where the mail steamer calls once a fortnight. Telegraphic communication can only be made through Henjam by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. The Resident can only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the coast, with possibilities of Wahabi aggression and the prospect of opening up an air service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time Political Agent and to instal there telegraphic or wireless communication. The Shaikhs are in general well disposed, and as life is mainly maritime there is always present in the Navy an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. A capable officer provided with a small but seaworthy launch in which he could visit the outlying Shaikhdoms seems to be the only means by which we can maintain real political touch with the Trucial Coast and efficiently arrange and maiutain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. The case is similar as regards Qatar, and it seems to be a matter for consideration whether closer and more definite arrangements should not be made with this Shaikhdom under the political advice of the Political Agent at Bahrain. Until some change is made on the lines above 1 can see little prospect of any satisfactory cr safe arrangement for aerial flight on the Arab littoral. Possibly, now that he has apparently dealt satisfactorily with his recalcitrant Najd tribes, Bin Sand may be able to take a more liberal view of flights over the Hasa coast, but in any case the distance between Kuwait and Bahrain is not great. Further down, however, there would appear to be an ever recurring risk of trouble unless the position is made more definite and consolidated. 5. Both as regards the Trucial Coast and the larger Shaikhdoms, there would appear to be a considerable element of doubt as to how far the policy which is formally and publicly enunciated is being actually carried out and whether it is not now advisable to review that policy with regard to actual conditions and needs.334: I extract the following from an article in an American magazine : “ Mascat is a British protectorate. Qatar, as well as iYucial Oman on the Persian Golf, is a British sphere of influence. Bahrain is practically a Crown Colony, and Koweit is bound by treaty to take advice and receive protection from the British Government.” There is little exaggeration here, but it differs substantially in actuality irom our theoretical position. 6. I cannot but think that many of the diflieulties we are now encountering on the Persian side of the Gulf would have been obviated had we taken earlier stock of our position and regularised and consolidated it when that position enabled us to do so, and there seems a possibility that eventually, with the growing power of Bin Sand or some other form of Arab nationalism, the time might come when failure to consolidate and regularise our claims in a more definite and less veiled manner might leave us to be shorn of privileges which we had long enjoyed, but which we had failed to make sufficiently regular to stand before a diplomatic court. 1 put forward these opinions with due deference, recognising that their only value is the relative one expressed at the beginning of para. 4 above. For that reason they may possibly merit further examination by an expert, and I can think of n &gt; one better suited to do so than the ollicer who is to take over charge from me, Colonel Barrett, who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral.

Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.F., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 5th September 1929. Sir, I have I have the honour ^ imtov \T^ V nx V /28, dated 21st May 1929, call in 1929, which is 20th April 1928 which is itself an amplification of Sir Lionel Haworth’s No. 169 S. of the Nut printed. t No. I above.4 2. Sir Lionel Haworth was of the opinion that the new Shaikh Shakbut would rule for a considerably shorter period than the 13 months ol his predecessor. Shaikh Shakbut has, however, in spite of our non-intervention, already nominally governed Abu Dhabi for a longer period than Shaikh Saggar. I say “ nominally governed,” as during my recent visit to Abu Dhabi it was obvious that the real governor is the murdering uncle, Shaikh Khalifa, who was treated with the greatest deference by all. Ko Arab Shaikh would be classed as a first-class life by an insurance company, so it is very unsafe to prophesy ; but so far as 1 can judge, there is no immediate prospect of another change of rulers, provided Shaikh Shakbut does nothing contrary to the wishes of his powerful uncle or the Junta, which exists in all these principalities. I doubt whether Sir Lionel Haworth s proposal, that “ in the event of a Shaikh’s being murdered, His Majesty’s Government will consult with the leading merchants and others of Abu Dhabi and then recognise a Shaikh elected by them,” is a real remedy. 1 am of opinion that no “ removal ” takes place until the successor has assured himself that the Junta will not be hostile to him. If 1 am right in my belief, the reference to “ the leading merchants and others ” would merely be an appeal from Caesar unto Caesar. 3. I have discussed the subject of fratricide with those whose opinion is of value, and 1 find that so long as it is confined to a Shaikhly family, it is looked upon as an ordinary occurrence about which no sensible person will bother his head. Of course, it is forbidden in the Quran, but that is a matter between the murderer and his conscience. One night there will be shouting in the town and some shots will be fired. The citizens will close their doors and go to sleep. The next morning it will be given out that the Shaikh is dead and has been succeeded by one of his relations. It is generally a family affair pure and simple. One of the new Shaikh’s personal retainers—usually a slave—may have been involved; but in most cases the coup de grace has been administered by the new Shaikh himself, as others are diffident about committing themselves to such an extent. In the case of Shaikh Saggar the actual murderers appear to have been Manasir Bedu, acting under the orders of Shaikh Saggar’s brother, Khalifa ; but otherwise it is the same story. Provided Shaikh Shakbut can keep the goodwill of his relatives by giving them sufficient maintenance allowances and preserve the suppoit of the Junta, there is no reason why he should not continue to rule Abu Dhabi. 4. The root of most of the fratricidal trouble is that although-thanks to the pearl trade—the rulers are not paupers, they are poor, and the poverty of the State renders it almost impossible for the ruler to satisfy the demands of his numerous relations. The anxiety of Shaikh Hamad (ruler of the rich State of Bahrain) to satisfy all his A1 Khalifa relatives—even those with whom he is not personally on good terms is a manifestation of the Arab rulers’ inherent dread of his relatives and anxietv to conciliate them. I am in absolute agreement with the views laid down by Sir Frederick Johnston in para. 3 .of his letter No. 133 S. of the 23rd April H)29.* Unless and until the Government of India are prepared to interfere much more than they have done in the past, and are prepared, if necessary, to bolster up a weak Shaikh, however much we may regret it, the only course is to continue to shake hands with successful murder. These Shaikhs are not Europeans nor products of modern civilisation, and we cannot apply our standards to them. The result of the policy of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be seen in Bahrain and Muscat, and if Government decide to adopt it they must do so with their eyes open to the consequences. ^ 5. It is quite within the bounds of probability that the bigoted prejudice of the Trucial Chiefs may force us to some policy of active interference in Trueial Oman if we wish to establish our air service along this coast; but the time has not yet arrived when l can recommend forcing ourselves on the Shaikhs regardless of consequences. 6. Sir Frederick Johnston further opines that in our dealings with these Chiefs both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests. ® * No. I, above.i here is much to be said for this view, but i think he was misled into exac^enrino- the extent of our interference by a recommendation from the Residence Affent' tlJ a sloop should be sent to enforce a llunniah’s claim against A,»l, , f i, • , , J was received shortly before he wrote his letter 8 A,ab of Dl ' lJa, ' '' lllcl1 —'O, I ' * 1IS recolnmen( l at| on did not amount to a desire to collect debts by bombardment v mt was merely an acknowledgment of that moral influence of His Majesty's Navy' which .s so useful to us on the coast. It was not essential for His Alijes yVsW to visit Dubai in this particular instance, but even if she had done so her o~e that m n0 M n ^° e t S ® al p y lave been mlwelcome t0 the Ruler, as it would show his people t. H‘ s Majesty s Government were behind him in his attempt to enforce a iust chum against a powerful subject. 1 u ce a J ll8t ( lai,n 7. One of the leasons for which we maintain an agent on the coast is the I protection of the interests of our British subjects, who are mainly Sindi Bmmiahs and iojas. The piesence of these British Indians gives us certain responsibilities but! lienefit fi 1Ve t S r C0 7 e8 ?r dm f a(lvanta ^ s &gt; and 1 ^ not think it would be o om tmeht tha they should pack up and leave. Long experience has taught the sidency Agent that the mere threat to summon a sloop is the best method of dealino* u ith continued recalcitrance. It is a gesture and nothing more. The fact that on?* inn 18 Tjj 1118011 ai i Arab makes him a much better judge than any European of the comse oi the secret intrigues that are always flowing on the coast. JJis nationalitv has also the disadvantage I hat our Agent cannot always keep himself free from undue interference m these intrigues. Khan Bahadur Isa Abdul Latif, 0 B E is the third SutTv eTfo oveH« Vc'’ ‘“'I tho , P°f ° f Ites . i(1 f“ c y Agent, ami the oonneciion has enmities have Ten^Cn hum l' S Th? t*? W attempted to take wives Horn the suits, they have built up for themselves a position of power aud influence whicli . oases jealousy, but on the whole they have done excellent work for His Majesty's Government, which none other than they could have performed. I recommend that we should continue to use the great influence of the family, but should attempt to supervise their work. J u atbt5m P b 10 8. At present the Residency Agent works directly under the Resident in Bushire who visits the coast once or, if means of transport allow, twice a year. In addition the coast is visited at frequent intervals by His Majesty's ships, whose presence has a niost benefic,al and tranquilhsing effect on the more unrulv elements on a d The commanders of these ships are practically the supervising Political Agents of the cotust, but their sphere extends from Ras al Had to Basrah and their term of service 0 , fined h&gt; two years In ibis short period it is impossible to learn the laugua-m am the customs or the local politics. The commanders must, in tlie nature of thing' be laigely in the hands ot their interpreters. Many of these men have done some excellent work but the fact remains that the Resideut’s appreciation of the Residency Agent s work depends largely on the reports of Baluchi interpreters. I he Residency Agent is a very astute man, and his relations with the naval interpreters are excellent. ttVlU 9. I he pay of our Residency Agent, who is so powerful on the coast and in many wa&gt;s so valuable is Rs. 150 per mensem. Out of this sum he and his ancestors have hitherto nominally maintained themselves, their wives and their numerous family ns we as an armed guard for their protection. They have hospitably entertained olhcek of H.s Majesty s Government, have paid for clerks, and lately have kept up a motor launch and a motoi car. I hey have also acquired a valuable portion of the Shargah Bazaar and rich date gardens at Ras al Khaimah. 8 . l %k e w on i de j® d a 7 that 7^* are tlie ob j ects of insinuations for which thei-e is no proof? ! he leading Bu.m.ahs of Dubai will tell me in confidence that all the Tmcial Shaikhs subsidise our Agent and that he gets Rs. 10,000 yearly Iroui this source; they will also tell me in confidence that our Agent takes 10 per cent, for iimse m every case in which his assistance is sought; they will tell me that, acting on the advice ot the Residency Agent, the Shaikh of Dubai will not permit boatmen to low them out to warships visiting the harbour; they will tell me also that our Residency Agent engineered the trouble at Dubai in April last in order to secure his own ends ami that he secretly opposes all attempts at British penetration just as his J; ' !' ‘‘I 11 ’ ” ,t the y Wl11 not commit their complaints to writing, nor will they make them in the presence of the Residency Agent. 4006 A 20 During my last visit to Dubai I asked them to propound a scheme of control for my consideration and to send it to Bushire. They promised to do so, but nothing has materialised. 10. With regard to the question of the appointment of a British Political Agoiit on the Trucial Coast, the position lias not materially altered since Sir Percy C ox ■discussed the question in his letter No. -84 of the 2oth January 1013. “ We must expect the newly-elected Shaikh to continue like his predecessor in the hands of a camorra of his ignorant and reactionary relatives, and with the means at my disposal l see no likelihood of being able to etlect any change in their attitude, as long as present conditions of British representation on the Coast are maintained, under which, though useful in other local ways, the Arab Agent of the Residency wields no appreciably 7 helpful influence where the larger questions of British interests or policy 7 are concerned. “ Our forbearance from proceeding forcibly with the inception of our mild measures of progress has borne no fruit in the past two yeais , on the contiuiy, the 1 )ebai community has only become the more confirmed and confident in its passive obstruction, through the Shaikh, to the least advance. In iact such movement as there has been, has been retrograde, for wheieas no definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of appioved Euiopenns for business purposes, the Shaikh has made the Hyacinth incident «i pietext ioi refusing admission to any European or quasi-European, even as agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company' s steamers; and I am convinced that until we do put our foot down to check this factious obstiuction we shall make no headway.” 11 The statements made by 7 Sir Percy 7 Cox are still true. 1 he Residency Agent is of the greatest assistance in most matters; but he is still unable to loice through the larger issues of British policy 7 . On the other hand, our expeiience at Bahuin, wheie the Government of India’s attempt to pursue a cautious policy failed, and finally an ultimatum, backed b\ T force, had to be issued, shows that even British officers find it impossible sometimes to beat down the stubborn obstinacy of Aiab Chiefs and their “ camorra.” 11. I have consulted the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, who is in immediate touch with the Trucial Chiefs. In the course of his reply 7 to my enquiry, he wrote:— . , . Erom many years of association with naval officers, both in days or smiles and crimes, the Irucial Arabs have developed a sort of fiiendship towards them, which they do not feel towards othei Euiopeans , but the Shaikh of Dubai last y ear would not agree to naval officers landing to look around the town unless accompanied by armed guards supplied by Isa or himself. Ihe Trucial Chiefs are definitely supicious of anything which to them appears as the thin edge of the European wedge poking its nose into their territories, and any innovation will certainly be resisted, though not by any means necessarily at once or bv open methods. They object to motor-cars and motor-boats, though Isa, by patient persuasion, has prevailed upon them to allow him to possess both. ~ They object to such ideas ns post offices and wireless, but when the slow mail calls at Dubai she receives letters to carry and the wireless operator receives bundles of messages to send. They frankly regard Bahrain as a typical example of the grasping hand of Britain, which, being given an inch, finally obtained possession of the whole place. Whether they are truly independent or not, they have a sturdy spirit of independence as regards determination to control their own affairs; and the first Shaikh who admits a Political Agent to be quartered upon him will be regarded as having sold his birthright. Many if not most of our steps in our progress towards developing controfof the coast have been made by way of punishment (e.g. permission for Isa to fly the Jack at Shargahj and this is known to the Arabs ; in fact a Shaikh can at times keep his people under control by reminding them that if thev do anything disliked by the Government the penalty will be some greater measure of Government control. Consequently the appointment of a Political Agent would be received as a serious punishment.” I have made this long quotation from the Senior Naval Officer’s opinion for comparison with Sir Percy Cox’s views of 1013 as, together, they form an admirable7 siiminiiig up of the present situation. Except in the improved relations between the Navy and the Arab Shaikhs, there lias been no material alteration in the past 16 years. “Europeans” are still vigorously excluded from the coast. The | prohibition has very occasionally been modified to admit of short professional visits by American missionary doctors, but applies even to the European pearl merchant, Rosenthal, whose presence, last year, as a competitor to Mohamed Ali Zainal would have been ol tlie greatest benefit to the pearl traders of Dubai. One of the reasons for the revolution in Dubai, which was attempted by the Shaikh’s family last April, was the circulation of a story that the ruling Shaikh had given permission to Mr. Straw (representative of the Standard Oil Company) to stay ashore for a night in Dubai while the mail ship was anchored off the coast. We signed the Exclusive Agreements of 1892 owing to our desire to exclude the French, and they have been useful to us. The Shaikhs welcomed the Agreements as they accorded so well with their own inclinations ; and after 1911 they have zealously enforced the policy against ourselves. It is our object now to modify this unwelcome development. Although 1 do not consider it an argument for upsetting what has been done there (see my letter to the Government of India, No. 385 S., of the 28th August 1929 :i: '), I .agree with the Senior Naval Officer that the example of Bahrain is before these peoples’ eyes. In the future this should be a civilising force, but at present the fear of losing their independence is a very major question and it is the greatest deterrent to permitting Europeans the slightest footing in their land. After all, are the Shaikhs wrong from their point of view ? They are anxious to preserve their valued independence and have not yet experienced the advantages of civilisation. If they permit close contact, what will be their fate? A weak barbarian State in close contact with a strong civilised one must sooner or later be absorbed or become a dependency, however much the stronger may desire to avoid this course. The history of the growth of British power in India is proof of this. 12. A British Political Agent, although our treaties of 1820 gave us the right to appoint him, would have to be forced on the Shaikhs, and the Political Agent would have to be protected by an armed guard, ft should be noted that our Arab Agent maintains an armed guard at his own expense. The proximity of those convenient folk—the Bedouins—would always, in the Shaikh’s mind, be a ready excuse for any “ unfortunate incident ” that happened to the lirst Political Agent. . Owing to the maritime life of the coast towns, the Navy can deal with recalcitrance, and their action, possibly with the assistance of the Royal Air Force, would so greatly exceed the hitherto mild discipline which they have occasionally administered that there would be no repetition of any unfortunate accident “ due to Bedouins, whom vou know we cannot control ” ; but this would be poor consolation for the first Political Agent I do not say that the lirst Political Agent would necessarily be murdered either at once or in the long run,'but it is a possibility which must be considered. I am sure that a British Political Agent would increase British influence on this coast, and smooth all difficulties in the way of the air service, these difficulties, owing to the settled Arab policy of exclusion, are considerable. If the Arabs continue their obstruction—and the air route is of vital importance and must be established quickly—I recommend that we force them to grant the necessary facilities, and at the same time force them to accept a British Political Agent to ensure that there will be no backsliding. The amount of pressure required should not be excessive. Owing to the maritime position of the town, the Navy could soon force any policy desired. Hie Arabs might threaten to emigrate as they did after the Hi/acinth incident; but if a trading centre such as Dubai were selected as the site for the new agency, the Arab .move should not be more thaii a trifling annoyance. Delmuk and his followers would go, but the Indian, Persian, and Babich trading community, after a protest that they had been ruined, would remain and prosper. If time presses a policy of pressure must be adopted ; but I prefer that a slower and more gradual method should be tried. 13 but owing to8 bones. Two years ago the entry of modern invention was prohibited, but now tho Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is inquiring about a Ford car, and has been for a flight in a flying boat; the Shaikh of Dubai lias purchased a motor launch for himself ; the richest and most influential merchant of Abu Dhabi lias also purchased a launch; and inquiries are being made whether Khalil Kanoo, of Bahrain, can bring his water-boring apparatus to the coast. These are small matters, but the progressiy^^^L Bahrain is having some effect on this benighted coast. 1 think it should be possible to take advantage of any advance that may be made, but the first desideratum is to restore that personal touch which vanished after 1910. IF Before the unfortunate Hyacinth incident of 1910 the personal influence of Sir Percy Cox had gone far to break down the barriers of reserve and suspicion ; but the whole position gained was lost by that unfortunate episode, and it has never been recovered. No successor has occupied the posit ion of Sir Percy Cox, and during a recent flying boat visit to Abu Dhabi, Captain Prior was surprised to find that not even the name of a single successor ol “ Kokus ” is known in that town. This is due to lack of touch and this lack of touch was due first to the preoccupation of the war and | subsequently to the withdrawal ol the Pesident’s despatch vessel. To maintain touch with his large maritime command the Pesident must have a despatch vessel, at the disposal solely of himself and his Political Agents. It is impossible for him to share this vessel with any other department, as was shown when an attempt w as made to make the same ship serve the double purpose of despatch vessel and tender to the lighthouses. Having obtained the despatch vessel, supervision over the work of the Besidency Agent on the Irucial Coast should be entrusted to the Political Agent at Bahrain, who should be relieved of routine work by his Indian Assistant. The Political Agents w r ork may be supplemented, if necessary, by the Secretary to the Resident. I he Political Agent must visit each Trucial Shaikh at least every quarter and be prepared, if necessary, to make a long halt off each town. At present the Pesident pays one, or at most two, visits of one day s duration each year. This is insufficient to inquire thoroughly into all problems, and the Pesidency x\gent’s recommendations are perforce accepted. Inquiries regarding the various monetary claims of British subjects and into the diving debts of so-called debtors, wdio are usually slaves w T ho have absconded to Bahrain, will give the Political Agent plenty of excuse for his presence. In addition, 1 am hearing most disquieting reports about the prevalence of the slave trade on this coast, and I anticipate that searching inquiries may have to be made. At fust, the 1 olitical Agent must return to his ship each night; but in the course of time, as he becomes better known and confidence is established, I hope he will be invited to stay ashore for ever lengthening periods. lo. My policy is gradually to restore, and improve on, the position which existed before the Hyacinth episode, when, as Sir Percy Cox reported, “ No definite objection was evei evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Fufoptans.” Having regained this position we can more easily, should we so desire, locate a British Political Agent ashore without fear of trouble. this policy is to be adopted il the Irucial Shaikhs do not compel us to take sterner measures to force through our air route. At present, the Shaikh of Pas al Khaimah is showing himself obstinate in his refusal of all requests for a refuelling station at his headquarters. Ihe Shaikh ol Ifainariyah, a dependency of Shargah, however, has offered to rent a store-room for the use cf the Boyal Air Force if his lagoon should prove useful to them as a flying boat harbour, the example of this Shaikh, Abdul hahiman bin Sail, will prove of use in breaking down the opposition of otheis on the coast, and the question of obtaining store-rooms will become one of pounds, shillings and pence. The Boyal Air Force will not be content with store-houses, however. Thov desire to have aerodromes, wireless stations, and rest-houses. The erection of a wireless station formed part of the ultimatum to the Shaikh of Dubai in 1911, which was subsequently allowed to lapse. The Royal Air Force wdsh to settle on this coast, and this means closer contact with the coast Arabs. I have in para. 11 stated the final result of close contact between a strong civilised Power and a weak barbarian State. 10. J he Government of India do not desire increased commitments, but they are bound to come. His Majesty’s Government must be prepared, in course of time, to —xr protect their friendly Shaikhs by armed force against attack by land or sea. The position of the 1 racial principalities, which have a hinterland of desert, should make this a comparatively easy task, but it is an unfortunate fact that the closer the contact with the British power the more defenceless do the rulers become and, consequently, the more dependent on British support. This, however, is for the future. For the present, in connection with the air route, I anticipate no great trouble in obtaining store-houses for petrol, but difficulties will increase when we demand wireless stations manned by a permanent staff. The Residency Agent is sufficient to meet the initial demands of the Boyal Air Force, but as these increase the need for a resident Political Agent will increase. Me will have to be appointed eventually, but 1 recommend that an attempt be made to prepare the way for the appointment. 17. To sum up: (l) The system of succession by murder, however inhuman, does not of itself necessarily lend to undue insecurity, as it is purely a family concern. We may deprecate it, but, except at the cost of interference in internal affairs, the final result of which cannot be forecasted, we cannot prevent it. I myself made a slight move during my last visit to the coast by addressing a letter to each Shaikh, in which I stated that fratricide was abhorrent to God and man, and asked their assistance in suppressing it by themselves refusing to acknowledge the succession of a fratricide. The Shaikhs one and all agreed with me in the polite Arab fashion, but 1 do not anticipate any great result from this pronouncement. (2) At present there is no undue interference on the coast. We have certain duties to perform in connection with the slave trade and the protection of British subjects, and it is only in connection with the performance of these duties that we interfere. (3) The projected air service down the coast has brought the time for the establishment of a Political Agent at Dubai considerably nearer ; but as a first step the people should be familiarised with the prospect by frequent visits of a British officer m the despatch boat which is absolutely necessary to carry out this scheme. (4) The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are well disposed, provided we confine our selves to the sea, but are extremely jealous of European penetration, which they see must ultimately lead to the extinction ol their independence. Every Shaikh, however well disposed he may be personally, must consider the junta and must walk warily. The coastal Shaikhs are by no means devoid of the avarice of the Semites, but thanks to the pearl trade they are not in the same state of poverty as the Shaikhs of the Aden Residency area, and consequently their price is much higher. (5) I do not recommend the immediate appointment of a Political Agent to reside on the coast unless His Majesty’s Government is lorced to adopt this course by the urgent demands of the Arab air route. (G) I can suggest no means of excluding W ahabi propaganda except self-interest. An “infidel” Political Agent will never be able to withstand the agents of an all-conquering Bin Sand ; but a population accustomed to the luxuries of life will not wish to be subjected to Wahabi fanaticism. If the population had acquired a taste for the advantages of civilisation and the Political Agent interferes no mere than is absolutely necessary to protect British interests, the Trucial Coast should defy W ahabi propaganda just as out fleet and Aii Force can repulse a military attack. If the inhabitants remain in then piesent backward state, I see no remedy against propaganda except the v\ord of Bin Saud and the plaving off of Ghufiri against llanawi. We can, if we wish, make ouiselves extremely unpleasant to the Trucial Shaikhs and then' subjects, indeed, b\ cutting off supplies ami the seizure of pearling dhows we can kill all these small principalities, but by proceeding to extremes we certainly run a risk of antagonising woiId opinion, which appears to be on the lookout for any stick which olfeis for beating the Butish Empire. 1 have, Ac., 0. C. J. Barrett, Lieut.-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I [P.T.O.* d (15) Letter from the IIon , ble Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. J. Larrett, C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 372-S. of PJ29, dated the 23rd August 1929. As the Government of India may wish to know how the negotiations for re fuelling stations for the Royal Air Force are progressing, I have the honour to sub mit a report for the period from 29th April, when I took charge of this Residency, up to date. I heard from an outside source, while I was yet Political Agent at Bahrain, that there was a hitch in the arrangements for storing oil and petrol at Ras-al-Khaimah. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company had been directed to send the stores to that place while no arrangements had been made for their reception. On arrival at Bushire, I learnt that not even Khan Bahadur Isa, the Residency Agent, had been advised of their arrival. I therefore directed that the petrol and oil should be stored at Shargah, under charge of the Residency Agent, until arrange ments could be made for their reception at Ras-al-Khaimah, which place I proposed to visit shortly by air, from a base at Hen jam. I may mention that Sultan bin Salim, the present Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, is a somewhat strict Wahabi, who considers himself an ’Alim. I had seen him before thrice—in April and November 1927—when I had visited Ras-al-Rhaimah with Sir Lionel Haworth. I had been struck on each occasion by his off-hand manner and lack of courtesy to the Resident. Colonel Dickson also informecrme that this lack of courtesy was very strongly marked when he himself accom panied Sir Lionel Haworth to Ras-al-Khaimah in October l.)28. After giving ample notice of my intention to come by flying boat, I arrived at Ras-al-Khaimah in the morning of 15th May and was at once met by the Residency Agent who conducted me, the Air Commodore in Iraq and the officers of the Royal Air Force to a tent, which he had pitched for our reception. He informed us that the Shaikh knew of our arrival and would come at once to pay his call. How ever, we had to wait one and a half hours before the Shaikh a. rived. On his arrival the Sheikh was polite and I mentioned that I had arrived by the most up R&gt; date method of transportation ; and he expressed pleasure and a desire for a flight it Khan n ENCLGSURE IN lltilA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Utter No. $ 10 to- Dated 7;noVJ’ 1929 Received 21 NOV. 1329 4On the occasion of his visit in May, Air Commodore Burnett had explained to Khan Bahadur Isa, the type of storehouse he required, and Khan Bahadur Isa had offered to build it himself and lease it to the Royal Air Force for a small monthly rent. Khan Bahadur Isa now suggested that, as an added inducement, the Shaikh might be asked to build the house and rent it to the Royal Air Force, To this suggestion I agreed. Khan Bahadur Isa has sent me the Shaikh’s reply to these last proposals, I enclose a translation of the relevant extracts from his letter and a complete translation of the Shaikh’s reply. It will be seen that he has absolutely refused to allow the Royal Air Force any footing in Ras-al-Khaimah and, though he agreed to their using the petrol which still remains in the dhow (about 1,000 gallons) he asks that no more should be sent. In my opinion there are several reasons for this refusal. There is the personal one. The Shaikh is of an exceptionally aloof nature, proud of his Arab nationality, and looks with contempt upon all foreigners—even Khan Bahadur Isa ; who is a Perso-Arab originally from Kharag Island. A more important reason is however to be found in the general policy of these petty Arab Chiefs of the Trucial Coast. This is to-day the same as it was when Sir Percy Cox wrote his No. 1112 of 30th April 1911 to the Government of India after the “ Hyacinth ” affair at Dubai: •“ The only specific and apparent outcome of the recent events is that the Shaikh has become astute enough to make use of the “ Hyacinth ” incident as a pretext for a professed inability to answer for the safety of a European at Dubai, and thus indirectly to suggest to us that the appointment of any British official ? whether for political or telegraph work, is not feasible for the moment. The Shaikh of Dubai (this applies to all the Shaikhs) does not welcome the idea of doser British supervision. The Shaikh seeing that the Hyacinth incident has provided him with a useful indirect peg on which to air the sentiment, is making the most of the open? ing afforded.” The same distinguished Political Resident had also stated in his 87 of the 8th January. 1911 : If the location of a British Agent is deferred, it will be deferred indefinitely and when the time is forced on us, there is no criterion that we shall not have the same difficulty to face then as we have now ”. Sir Percy Cox was discussing the question of a Trucial Coast Political Agency or Telegraph station, but his statements are true to this day. They apply to any European footing on the Coast, and have really gained force by delay. imagine that the Hyacinth ’ incident taught us a lesson, and they are fortified in this belief by the way we have acquiesced in the total exclusion of Europeans from the Coast. Not a, single European is allowed to land—let alone stay for a night on the Coast—without express permission from a Shaikh previously obtained. The Shaikh of Dubai refused to permit Mr. Rosenthal to visit Dubai in spite of the big profit anticipated by pearl dealers from dealing direct with him. They have also recently refused to allow the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to open an agency m their town. r j Finally one of the reasons I have heard given for the events in Dubai last April is that a false story was circulated that Mr. Straw, of the Standard Oil Com pany, was staying in the town for the night, with the permission of Shaikh Saeed. The Shaikhs consider their policy has kept the Oman Coast free and inde pendent in spite of occasional discipline from the Navy. 1 hey think that any weakening in this policy would mean the beginning of the end. they are united in no other matter but in this alone, though I do not say it is impossible to dissolve the bond.| 7 &lt; 4 It is of no great value to point out the benefits the Shaikhs have received from Britain. They admit the inestimable benefit of maritime peace, but they point out that they are not receiving the support to which they think they are entitled against Persia. Some even consider that we ate an impediment in the way of the attainment of their rights by direct actions In moments of ceremony even the surly Shaikh of Bas-al-Khaimah may say to the Resident that the British are not as other nations; but there is no doubt that the Persians have given our position in the Gulf a set-back by the Tanb inci dent of last year and also by their attitude towards the Baharaneh of Mohammerah. This latter, however, does not have repercussions on the Trucial Coast equal to its effect further north. It will be seen that in his latest reply to Khan Bahadur Isa, Shaikh Sultan of Ras-al-Khaimah has attempted to draw a red herring across the path by pretend ing that he has been badly treated in the matter of the Tanb lighthouse. I am informed by Khan Bahadur Isa that he first mentioned this matter after his pilgrimage *to Mecca. On his return he stayed at Karachi, and some one there put the idea into his head. After consulting the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, as to Tanb lighthouse fees, I have written to inform the Shaikh that he is wrong in considering that the British Government deprive him of any revenue from the lighthouse. A small fee is levied from ships passing up the Gulf for the upkeep of the Tanb and .other lighthouses, but the money derived from these fees is under the control of a Committee specially appointed for the control of lighthouses, lightships, lights and buoys. AU the revenues are expended in repairs and maintenance, in refuelling and in canyaag stores to the light keepers. For this purpose a special ship, based on Basrah, is maintained. I have moreover consulted my records to see the correspondence which passed between Shaikh Saggar bin Sultan, of Shargah, and Sir Percy Cox regarding this ^lighthouse and there is no reference to revenues. Sir Percy Cox merely stated: &gt;&lt; Your interests will be benefited and strengthened by the placing of the light at Tanb This referred to the indication to all the world given by Government that they regarded Tanb as the property of the Jowasimi chiefs with whom they had negotiated permission to erect the light house. With regard to the Air Force store-house, I pointed out that Government wished only to rent a house to store petrol and asked him to lay down buoys, for which they would pay, so that the flying boats could moor themselves securely. They wished to be treated merely like other people hiring property in Ras-al- Khaimah were treated. They had no desire to hoist flags or make any claim to sovereignty. I pointed out that His Majesty's Government had been in friendly relations with Ras-al-Khaimah for a hundred years, and that his own distinguished pre decessor, Shaikh Salim bin Saggar, had been very helpful to the Political Resident (Colonel Pelly) in connection with the land telegraph. It would be an astonishing thing if that Shaikh Salim’s successor proved less helpful to an old friend in the trifling matter of a petty store-house. Shaikh Salim bin Sultan is a difficult person with whom to do business ; he is doubtful of our motives and afraid to commit himself. I am hopeful however that after delivering my letter, which has been written throughout in a very friendly strain, Khan Bahadur Isa Abdul Latif may be able to overcome his opposition. The Royal Air Force wish to rent at once an aerodrome and store-house at Abu Dhabi; but I have informed them that I consider the moment inopportune. It is necessary to succeed in my assault on Ras-al-Khaimah before turning attention to the wilder Abu Dhabi, which has a particularly blood-strained record. The Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah appears to be in a position to act more or less as he pleases , but if the young Shaikh Shakbut, of Abu Dhabi, dared to deviate from the path laid down for him by the Abu Dhabi oligarchy, fratricide would quickly remove him as it did his three immediate predecessors.8 Extract from letter No. 376, dated the 5th Rabi al Awval 1348 (11th August 1920) from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to the Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to report that a long discussion took place between myself and Shaikfc Sultan bin Salim for acquiring a place for petrol. I gave him full assurance on behalf of the British Government that she does not intend to interfere with their property and their town, but she requires a place for petrol, that he should build a godown and lease it to the British Government on annual rental according to the usual commercial custom of hiring the trading houses, and shops and receive from the British Government large amount of Rs. 500/700. It is possible that if he arranges agreeably, the amount may be raised to Its. 1,000. He promised to give me a reply of acceptance. He has since sent me a letter which I enclose for your honour's information. I am thinking over the changed attitude of the said Shaikh. The contents of the said letter of the Shaikh are that no matter about the present oil in the jollyboat, but after it is finished no more should be brought to Ras-ai- Khaimah. The remaining explanation is due to his policy as I heard from some of his tribesmen who are our friends that the people of Ras-al-Khaimah have no objection and they can not withhold the Shaikh from giving a place for petrol. I then made secret enquiries and found that some ignorant persons of Ras-al-Khaimah who do not appraise the after effects, have frightened the Shaikh by saying that if he gave a place for petrol then the British Government will demand from him a piece of land for a house. On hearing this I called Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Saif, Headman of Al Hamriyah as he is a sincere friend of the British Government. The said Shaikh came to us and we sent him to mediate and to advise the Shaikh Sultan bin Salim to remain on friendship with your honour and to give a place or to build himself a godown and receive rent which would be good for him and that he should remain friend of your honour and of the British Government. He could not obtain from him acceptance except what he wrote to us in his letter I enclose herewith for your honour’s information the letter of Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Saif. Wi^h great respect I beg to submit that the personal conduct of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim is not good. In my opinion if you wish to obtain a place for petrol at Ras-al-Khaimah by good ways and by agreement, I do not think you can get from this Shaikh. Consideration for the Arabs is your honour’s policy. You may write to the Shaikh a polite letter as may suit your opinion. Possibly on receipt of your letter the said Shaikh may accept to give the place or himself build a godown. The Shaikh mentions in his letter about the island of Tanb and asks what profits the British Government gave to the Shaikhs of Al Qawasim. This should not be taken to mean that if something is given to him about Tanb, a place for petrol will be obtained from him. This is defensive argument from him. In my opinion it will be very degrading for the Agents of Great Britain, in the eyes of the Arabs of Oman coast, to leave Ras-al-Khaimah after advertising the arrivals of aeroplanes in Ras-al-Khaimah, I do not think a way can be obtained from the other Shaikhs. It would be better to coerce the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah so that the others agree easily. And opinion is with your honour. ********** Translation of a letter from Sultan bin Salim to the Residency Agent, Shargah. With reference to your friendly reference and address to me about the aeroplanes that either we should ourselves build or permit you to build in a piece of land and that the British Government will give us a fixed amount as hire and that she (the British Government) has no intention to interfere in our property and boundary and we should not fear that anything may happen to us or to our tribe, know you, may God protect you, that at your repeated requests on the subject, I sent for brother Mohammad and his sons and the tribe, and consulted them about this question. They showed displeasure and although I treated them and explained them all that may scare away their fears, but they were far from pleased. Now on account of the friendship between our predecessors and ourselves and the British s9 Government and the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, we forgive for the petrol now in the jollyboat and request the Hon’ble the Political Resident to excuse us from importing any more oil, just as we had told him in the past. Verily we fear all may be displeased and something displeasing may occur, between us, our relations and tribesmen, and we may be in danger. Secondly we received yesterday from your hands a watch, and you said that it was a present from the Sahib of the aeroplanes. We were astonished very much, as it is customary that whenever a present is sent by the Government a letter accom panies it and we send a reply and thank the sender of the present. We also mentioned to you about the island of Tanb and the revenues that accrue from it, from that day till to-day we are waiting for a compensation from the High Government and the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Gulf. When we wished to belittle the thing (aeroplane affairs) to the relations and the tribe, they ask us about the Tanb island. They say “ let us know from that date up to this day what compensation has been paid to you by the Government MC499FD— 15-10-2 9-20— GIPSSECRET. INDIA OFFICE. (P. 6258/29.) Question of British Interference in the Administration of Bahrain. Despatch No. 385 S. of 1929, from the Hon. Lieut.-Col. C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, Sir, Bushire, 28th August 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. F. 164-N./29 of the 28th May 1929** asking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken. 2. The history of the development of our concern in the internal affairs of the islands is fully set forth in Lieut.-Col. Haworth’s Despatch to the Government of India, No. 295 S., of 1st September 1927,t so it is unnecessary to repeat it. I wish, however, to stress the following points:— (a.) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as ruler of the islands, and it was entirely due to our support that he had been able to keep his position. (6) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration. (c) From 1904, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interest in internal matters increased, and we continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He, however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. (d) In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concerned, and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him, as he was “ only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbearance.” The most important results of our intervention were the abolition of Shukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was Shaikh Isa’s own nephew), and tho assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice. In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— “ I do not see how we can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the government of the islands through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade.” He was accordingly in favour of stronger measures, but His Majesty’s Government decided that the amelioration of the internal government should be sought by indirect and pacific means. (e) In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla’s interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel showed how the P. 5649/20. Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench of Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to stop misrule. (/) The gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 rescued the people—especially the Baharanah, and the opening that this oppression gave to foreign nations—especially the Persians and the ahabis. The oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly’s report forwarded to Government under Colonel Trevor's letter, No. 23 S., dated 8th January p. 900/22. 1922. (g) Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Government that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of % the Political Agent. * Not printed. ■ r - _ , f Reprinted as Enclosure No. 2 to Teheran Despatch to Foreign Office, No. 4s4, of 7th October 1927 [P. 5668'27].o (Ji) W ith an uneducated Arab, independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers, and treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class. (/) Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice. A} (j) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend he and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go through the same grind as we have come. o. Throughout the history of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interierence displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 thev decided ‘ to pursue a cautious policy.” Later, the Political Agent was to “seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaikh.” e &amp; In 1922 they “ did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh ami Ins people.

The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad natured at heart Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Pol S Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler he was easv-noin' ,n,l if. strong dislike for interfering with the actions of .Unibers of hfo faTify even v en these took the form of gross tyranny.

In view, however, of the probability that Bahrain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign drillers and oil workers, I do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Police unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion—which would certainly include a number of tough characters*—will not take place. On the analogy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Gulf Syndicate would probably start a security service of its own, and the Bahrain Stater wdll require a European Commandant of Police to deal with it, and with the bad characters attracted by the chance of employment. 5. I turn now to the Customs Department. This was an old bone of contention between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. It was Colonel Mead who first sn gg es t e( l bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the pretence suited him. In any case, the question of the Customs Department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. The old system was to farm out the Customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to the State was much less than it should have been. This loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from the yield of the Customs since it has been put under conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more. Customs is the main source of revenue to the State and brought in during the past year Rs. 11,24,079, out of a total of Rs. 12,15,694. The Director of Customs is not only in charge of the department from which he takes his name, but he is also Port Officer and controls the passports, registration of boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various departments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them. At present the head is a European. Is anything to be gained by substituting an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqian ? lo the untrained eye of an Englishman, an Egyptian might look more indigenous than an Englishman, but to a resident of the Gulf he would still be a foreigner. The Customs is not a political department, and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like Bahrain the personality of the man who collects 90 per cent, of the revenues must count for something. As in the case of the Adviser, why jettison a European, who can be trusted, in order to replace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity and whose intrigues one can never be sure ? 0. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation very well in one of his reports to me, when he stated that Mr. de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the efficient collector and conserver are removed, what is to happen to a State which has become accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history ? Not only have the claims of the idle and ever increasing A1 Khalifa been generously met, but for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people, and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed, his place would be taken by an Arab from Bahrain—almost certainly one of the A1 Khalifa. With the exception of Shaikh Abdulla there is at the moment not a single member of the A1 Khalifa fit either by character or education to fill the post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principality as those of the Trucial Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh century. Thanks to its geographical situation as the gateway to Najd and to the pearl trade of which it is the centre, it has always been a trading centre, and has attracted to itself a number of foreigners, who are in contact with the outside world. Thanks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1923, its administration, once a by-word, is now the admiration of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens of Dubai, for instance, envy Bahrain, though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to copy it. 7. ft has repeatedly been said that Bainain has been westernised too hurriedly. It is necessary to examine this statement, for although there is a substratum of truth in it, 1 think it conveys a wrong impression that all native institutions have been ruthlessly swept away. The reforms instituted in or shortly before 1923 related to— (a) Municipalities. (b) Reorganisation of the Customs Department. (c) Institution of a proper police force./ V, 4 P. 900/22. Td) Appointment of an Adviser to the Shaikh. (e) Reformed Courts. (f) Reforms in connection with the pearl fishery. (g) Survey. (h) Public Works. (i) Education. (j) Reform of the Waqfs. I will take the above seriatim. (a) Before and during the war Bahrain was notorious for its unhealthy climate ; the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A demand for greater cleanliness arose, and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by Major Dickson (the Political Agent), prevailed and a municipality was established in 1920. This municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed by the establishment of another in Muharraq. The two Municipal Councils—the members of which are partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad’s brother. The Political Agent and the Adviser attend the meetings, but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance. In 1920 a considerable part of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as a' valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipal^ was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand, without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished filth and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence at municipal meetings of the Political Agent and the Adviser, who have no vote, is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular. (b) , (c) and (d) have already been treated in paras. 1 and 5 above. (e) Major Daly’s report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The Qadhis were corrupt or impotent. A good Court of Law was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position to the latter. At present there are the following Courts functioning in Bahrain :— (1) The Joint Court, on which the Ruler and the Political Agent sit to hear cases civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor A1 Khalifa. (2) The Political Agent’s Court, for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned. (o) 1 he Court of Shaikh Sulaiman, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave, for the trial of Bahrain subjects. (4) The Small Cause Court, conducted by a minor member of the A1 Khalifa. In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts Thev usually deal themselves with criminal cases, though a considerable number are referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court fnr opinion. Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— (a) The Court of the Qadhis—Sunni or Shiah as the case mav be (b) The Majlis al IJrfi. (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. Ihe Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters divorces, inheritances, &amp;c. I hey often advise in criminal matters, but their peculiar laws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make itimnnsaiblp to hand criminal justice completely over to them. ^ The Majlis al Urfi is ihe Court dealing with the customary law of trade It is the commercial Court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There are20 members Its meetings are weekly—10 members sitting on alternate Thursdays, iintler an A1 Khalifa president. It deals with trade disputes, on the whole expeditious y and well. Its members aie all appointed by Shaikh Hamad subject, in the case of foreign members, to the Political Agent’s veto. 1 he Salilah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to living. Uefoie 1*123 ibis Court consisted of one venal old man, whose decisions were a disgiace to the State. Xow, except for a bias against foreigners, it functions satisfactorily. brom this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent- established under the Order in Council—a member of the A1 Khalifa is -associated with all the proceedings of justice. Even the Political Agent’s Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As aheady stated, the A1 Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant, and it. would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser. Both Shaikh Hamad—when he can be aroused to interest him- sell—and his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge; but as they themselves confess, they would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their -advisers. In the course of time Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place when he succeeds his father in the rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. (f) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts has been established and, thanks to the supervision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot, from being the worst, has become the best in the Gulf. (g) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has an extensive area under gardens. It was found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky wav, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons' ’ The result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by careful enquiry followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village areas followed. At first the survey of villages was resented, as people could not understand the reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits. Those villages which have not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately. (h) Public works have not been numerous, and there is no regular Public Works Department; but public utility works, such as the sea wall and the road alongside it, are much appreciated. One of the-results of these works is. that the inhabitants of Kuwait and other ports are apt to point to the deficiencies of their home towns -and get into trouble with their Shaikhs, but the leaven works. If Bahrain continues on his own initiative to supply public gardens and walks, start electric schemes and carry out works for the public benefit, such as the proposed causeway from Manama to Muharraq, it is sure, by its example, to ameliorate the conditions in its lesser advanced sisters on the Arab coast, and wean ihem from that surly isolation in which most of them live. I mention “on its own initiative ” because all public utility schemes—except the Manama sea wall and road, which are the work of Major Daly—were conceived by Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their European advisers for guidance. The British name is benefited by this progress. (t) Education is still backward, but thanks to the push of Shaikh Abdulla, the Ruler’s brother, it has made immense strides during the past two years. The drive in this case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves Except in the matter of making hitherto fruitless efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to educate his own sons, neither the Political Agent nor the Adviser has taken any steps unduly to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been put at the service of the State when asked. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases without the intervention of the Political Agent or Adviser, at good salaries, and there are now five indigenous Arabic boys’ schools and one girls’ school on the island, in addition to two Persian nationalist schools. In addition, eight Bahrain boys, including three close relations of the Ruling Chief, have been sent to the American University at Beirut for education. I trust that these three boys will turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak—the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad—will provide material for the higherappointments in the State, and ultimately will prove competent to take over the position now held by the Kuropean Adviser and Customs Director. (j) Waqfs are eminently a religious matter in which it behoves foreigners, especially non-Muslims, to walk very warily. Just before his departure. Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals, attempted i to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be best not to* interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal policy of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recently the Shiahs themselves appointed a committee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow suit, large sums now pocketed by the Qadhis mav become available for primary education. 8. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and 1 see nothing that can be profitably altered at the present moment. Innovations which met with opposition in are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the development of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularity of the British Government, which was worked up in the Arabic and other Press, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain, and especially the Shiah Baharanah, will be forgotten, and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts will be noticed. To avoid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this cause, it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British officials. ( J. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful understudy for Mr. de G renier offers in Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim al Khalifa—at present a third- year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industry, but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior thinks, however, that when he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. I consider Captain Prior’s proposal very sound and recommend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim’s indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient performance of his duties, one of his younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy Ruler —who are first-year students, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior, in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet, has stated truly : “ So long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking, and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of place, he does not mind what happens to Bahrain.” Such a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about o5, who will probably succeed him. Sulaiman is not without promise; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the magisterial bench, but he is uneducated and -in some ways little removed from a Bedu. The only really capable member of the Al Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamad’s brother, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his previous evil record. Of Shaikh Hamad’s sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarak, the fourth son. In my letter No. 860 S. of 21st August 1929 I have already recommended that a good tutor should be obtained for him. It is hoped that in due course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help first to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son to follow after him, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the European Adviser. 11. With the spread of education it should be possible to conduct the adminis tration of Bahrain without any British interference in internal affairs in a manner which will not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy Ruler and the lack of men of suitable character, this is impossible.t I have laid particular stress on education in the rulers because the merchant -classes in Bahrain, both foreign and native, are advancing rapidly in this respect; and the public are demanding more schools, technical education, increased medical help and trained midwives, and larger public works. A go-ahead population cannot permanently lie ruled by uneducated tribesmen any more than Moroccan tioops could permanently hold down the Rhine provinces. Bahrain is a large trading centre with a large foreign population. It is not part of I\ajd and •would never be happy under Wahabi rule. The real Bahraini, though an Arab, is a Shiah, not a Sunni; and the history of the islands shows that for long periods it, was subject to Persia. This, although not leading to any desire for Persian rule, must modify the tribal outlook. !-• 1 am i ri favour of an indigenous Arab Government standing on its own feet; but you cannot without grave risk of bloodshed—rapidly reverse all that has been done in the past six years. f he Baharanah, lor the first time since the Khalifa ousted the Persians, have had security and justice and have come to think of their rights. After tasting these sweets they will not lightly forgo them. the peojJe trom history, the Bam Kashid rulers of Hail or the Saiy: quote from an interesting review by Mr. B. S.-Thomas appearing in the Near East and India of 18th July, page 78 :— f he first act of young Said bin Sultan was to deco\^ his regent uncle and to assassinate him. This ‘ will to power ’ was applauded by the country. It was no strange means to employ. Incidentally Said’s successor, Thuwaini, was destined to be murdered by his own son, Salim, who thereupon succeeded to the Sultanate. During the past five years fratricide, a time-honoured institution for the purpose, has on three several occasions been responsible for a change of Shaikhship in the powerful Omani tribes of Bani Ali and Bani Yas.’ 5 Government interfered with the free working of the Arab system first when they placed Shaikh Isa in his father’s room in 1809 and again when they replaced him by Shaikh id a mad in 1923. Under the Arab system Abdulla might have removed Shaikh Isa—he would certainly have removed Shaikh Hamad. Government is disturbed by the blood-stained record of Oman ; they could not now permit similar occurrences in Bahrain. 14. We have to make the best of Shaikh Hamad and he must have an ad viser— either European or Arab—or in the alternative take upon himself the role of a constitutional king, confine his activities mainly to social affairs and leave business in the hands of a Council. This Council system might well be tried, but only after the death of Shaikh Isa. The old Shaikh has retired from active interest in affairs, but he still counts for something, and his naturally conservative tendency renders him opposed to all change. In addition, on the score of expense to the State, it is not desirable that Bahrain, which is already paying a pension of Rs. 5,000 yearly to Shaikh Isa, should be saddled with an idle Hamad. I anticipate no serious opposition from Shaikh Hamad himself to the idea of a Council, provided he is still titular and social head. It will give him a chance of that otinm cum dignitate for which he craves. The members of the Council might in the first place be Shaikhs Abdulla bin Isa and Sulaiman bin Hamad, with the Adviser as third member, under the presidenev of Shaikh Abdulla, with Shaikh Mubarak marked to succeed eventually to the Adviser’s place. 15. I wish to emphasise that even at present there is considerably more Arab control of the Bahrain administration than would appear at first sight. In consequence, the present administration is popular in the islands. I agree, however, that the British are too much in the high-lights, and that the signs of British influence appear too clearly in the Indian police force trained like an Indian infantry regiment though their uniform has been modified. I recommend that this high-light be modified bv substituting Sudanese* an Arab-speaking force, which blends better with the population. I recommend further that, unless a European is required to deal with an influx of Europeans and Americans attracted by the Gulf Oil Company, the servicei 8 of the European Commandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of his- present contract, but that the services of the Adviser and the Diiectoi of Customs be retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take then place. 1G. Shaikh Hamad has already extended the term of the Adviser’s contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further^ quaternary extensions. . . It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Criemei , but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, 1 have not discussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself westernise the islands in possibly an unfortunate way, and I presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18. It appears from para. 2 of your letter under reply that Government is purturbed at the danger that, with the example of Bahrain before their eyes, the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin Saud. It is true that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are extremely jealous of any British encroachment on their independence, just as Shaikh Isa was betoie his loiced relinquishment of {power. They oppose any concession to the European. Ido not, however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in Bahrain. It is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. . . No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the Hyacinth episode of 1911 occurred. It is from this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoved by the people of Dubai that 1 date the incieasingl\ independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections to the admission of Europeans to the coast, llis statement was true in 1911 and is true to this day ; but the British policy in Bahrain obviously cannot be blamed for If we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough iiom which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleaied the wav P 5040 / 20 . for Bin Saud. In 1920. Maior Dickson reported : “ Our position in the island is founded see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to call in British advisers on then own account, but m time their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Sand, he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. The attitude of the Shaikhs of the coast will be guided by self-interest as it, has- ever been. If we have consistently and with success espoused their cause against Persia and Najd they will look to us for support. If we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the coast and cause us trouble as Peza Shah has in Persia ; but I do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement. 1 he chastisement was salutary and Shaikh Isa’s supporters have accepted the present regime, which is not unduly westernised. I have shown some w r ays in which the outward form may be modified while retaining the spirit, but I do not advise the jettisoning of useful European officials nor the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated. 19.

The Political Resident, in reporting on the ^eneral question of the relations of tne Bushire Residency ruth the Crucial Sheikhs in 1902, remarked that, consequent on the &lt;%. Treaties of 1820 -and 1853, the Resident had secured position of paramount influence. Infractions of tne maritime peace had. been promptly punished, and, mile it had not been our custoiijio interfere in the internal disputes or the successions of the Crucial 'Tiiefs, our decided predominance enabled us in fact to interfere even in internal disputes in the interests of peace. 'The general tranquillity, both maritime and internal, of this part of the coast during recent years seems to me to show that our policy, which may aptly be described as a judicious policy of overlordship, has been fully maintained. In my opinion it cannot be improved on.' * -2* In 1908, Sir Percy Cox, in a general review of the measures necessary for tne protection of British interests in the Persian Gulf region, remarked: 'The experience of tne last two or three years makes .,16 doubt whether it is safe to leave these backward Sheikhs (i.e., the Crucial Sheikhs) longer in the charge of a native Agent. I shall shortly address ovemment a separate communication on the subject.' On the 25th September, 1908, the Board of Trade suggested to the foreign Office the possibility of establishing a British Consular officer at Dabai, to which uich of the trade formerly done at Lingah had been transferred. The Viceroy, telegraphing to the Secretary of State on the 9th October, 1906 (P. 1886/08), remarked as regards paragraph 2 above, 'ms regards the Crucial Coast, we await Cox’s further representations'. ^ At the beginning of 1909, the Board of Trade sent a hi. mxers 00 enquire into commercial possibilities m tne mulf.&lt;1 PiTcno^ir^.

I'r. Akers recormiended the estaolish.lent of a Vice-Consulate, in addition to the provision of banking facilities and Tireless. It appeared that Vessrs. oncidiaus hac been in touch with the SheilUi as regards the establishing of a branch of their business. f* r ^ n Brd ..larch, 190?, Sir Percy Cox telegraphed as -o 11° v/Sy^to the Government of India with reference to paragraphs 2 and 5: 'Since writing the 5th (? 15th) paragraph of letter o. 1726 dated 6 th June, 1908, I have given careful consideration and examination to the question of our i epresentation on the Trucial Coast. Although conditions are . iiiicult and in many respects unsatisfactory, I have come to ultimate u h e/c on elusion shat .he time is not vet ripe for the permanent residence of a British Political officer on the coast. The Sheikhs require cauaious h ndling, and there is some fear that the permanent presence of a British officer mijit ^ ave efxect of provoking issues in connection with the status of the Sheikh?and the pearling industry which are quiescent at present, and which it would not be to our interest to raise now. tfv ' y opinion is that, if we appoint a British officer to Lingah, he will have ample time to make frequent sojourns at Dabai'to study trade ramifications there, which are closely allied to those at Lingah. If in addition to this sanction is accorded ^o Are connection of Dabai with Henjam by wireless telegraph, and if, lastly, a convenient opportunity is taken o_. uran^ferring from onargah oo labai the headquarters of our native .\gent, our interests on the coast shoul: for the present be adequately safeguarded.' The Resident's views were accepted(3“f8&gt; . ^ M by the Government of India and the Secretary of State, and a Vice-Consulate was established at Lingah in larch 1910. C The habai incident. On the 24th December, 1910, a party from H.M.S. 'Hyacinth” landed at Dabai to search for arms r was fired on by the natives, and lost four men killed and nine wounded. The political Resident and the Naval Commander-in-Chief presented an ultimatum to the Sheikh, who was required within 48 hours to pay a fine, to deliver certain rifles, and 'accept a British officer as an Agent, with a small personal puard, and co-operation in finding himself suitable quarters, according of protection and friendly treatment'. The Naval Commander-in-Chief, in reporting the terms of the ultimatum, remarked 'The Resident and I are convinced that both political / commercial, and arms traffic requirements on the Trucial Coast demand trie appointment of a British officer at Naval C-in-C to .Idmiralty No. 233, d/- 30th Dec., 1910: P. 4389/10.

'' y Vie Sheikh complied with the other demands made upon him. As regards the British Agent and the question of establishing an Indian post office, he was informed that 'he must fully understand he would have to accept decision of Government without question.” The Naval Commander-in-Chief remarked tiiat the Sheikh was, however, a v eak ruler, and that the indications were that, while not himself intractable or unfriendly, he was coerced by a faction of truculent relatives, who were strongly opposed to any inconvenient increase of British influence or domination. His/7 P. 262/11. His Excellency added that in his opinion and that of the Political Resident 'it becomes all the more necessary to locate a British Agent here, in order to strengthen our hold not only upon Dabai but upon the coast generally.' He went on, however, to remark that the employment of force might be necessary to secure this in present circumstances. The Government of India and His Hajesty’s Government took the view that the installation of a British Agent by bombardment and armed force was most undesirable. The Resident was informed accordingly (telegram from Viceroy dated 23rd y 44 I yi\Aj^cXK^. January, 1911: P. 205/11) that the question of an Agent, of A a wireless installation and a post office must be deferred until affairs had settled down and confidence had been restored. g Sir Percy Cox, in replying (letter dated 8th January, 1911) to the criticisms of the Government of India on the handling of the Dabai incident, strongly urged the installation of a British officer and a telegraph station on the coast. He contested the Government of India’s view tnat the situation vould be adequately met by visits of the Vice- Consul from Lingah until such time as friendly relations had been re-established, and remarked 'I cannot but fear that, if the location of the British Agent is deferred, it will be deferred indefinitely, and that when the time is forced upon us, there is no criterion that we snail not have the sa^e difficulty to face then as we have now ... I would not recommend this transference of the present location of the British officer, did I think that it would result m any permanent or widespread ebullition or combination of hostility against us; but at present I see no grounds for feann^ such a contingency.

P^RSI^ GULF SUB-CO^jilTTZS. suB-coiuiiriis ol; poli tic o gqi^rol. ITote by tLe deputy Chief of the Air Staff. Since the Political Control Sub-Committee last met and since the hraft Report was circulated, o copy of the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf for the Year 1^£3 has been forwarded to the .air Ministry. It contains a point of some importance which bears upon the work of the Sub committee ana I have ielt it desirable, even at this late stage in the progress of the Committee, to draw attention to it. Copies of the Report will, it would appear, be in the possession of the other departments concerned. Ilic paragraphs in the Administration Report to which I would draw attention arc on pages 54 and 55. It is clear from these paragraphs that Ibn Saud, while he is careful at present to leave alone the Shaikhs of the coastal communities of iruciul Om^n, is undoubtedly working to consolidate Lis influence over the tritiles behind them and gradually to encroach towards them. This is a process of infiltration which is directly counter to out interests and, as was evident when our reconnaissance parties were turned out of the Oman i.i mm Ijyl- | take some more definite steps to offset his influence. Tnc Administration Report at the 'bottom of page 54 emphasises strongly ’the necessity for defining clearly, the Political Resident’s jurisdiction in Trucial d an ', and again en page 55 the Report states r It is aaily becoming more difficult for the Residency xi^ r nt t Siiargah, to control efficiently the affairs of his very extensive charge. The remedy would appear to lie in the appointment oi a Political Agent for the Trucial Coast or at least an Assistant to the Residency A^ent.' L^v justification for drawing attention to tais matter which primarily is a matter of political administration is that it las a airect relation to the development oi the air route through Trucial Oman. The stretch of the air route which it is likely to be the most difficult to establish is that stretch where the route cuts across the Oman peninsular irom near Shargah to Kuscat. It is most important that our prestige in dealing with the Shaikhs in this section should be as high as possible, and it is very desirable that, if possible, a British official should be available at each end cf the section to carry through any dealings with the Shaikhs which may be necessary; ana I would therefore urge that the present Committee should give careful consideration to the remedy which is suggested in the extract I q.uote above. It would certainly s^em that a British official with more clearly defined powers is, in view of our increased interests cold the difficulty of this section oi the x».ir Route, now required at Shargah.

With regard to the sueetion of the appointment of a British ihlitical Agent on the rrucial OoaBt, tint position ha© not materially altered cince r»ir ei cy goa die cursed the queetion in ilia m&gt;e &amp;64 of ttie r^bth January 1913: 'we must exi*Qt Urn newly elected iiaiiih t© continue like hi© predeceaeor in the hands of a eanorr* of hiw ignorant and reactionary reiativea, and with the mans at my disposal i eee no likelihood of being able to effect any change in their attitude, as long as presenl conditions of Britiah re «re sent ail on on the Coast6, - 7 - M Co*at are maintained, under which, thougii useful in other local ways, the Arab A^ent of the nssiaency wields no appreciably helpful influence where Hit larger questions of British interests or policy are concertied. « • • • e •Our forbearance from proceeding forcibly with the inception of our mild measures of progress has borne no fruit in the past two yeare; on the contrary, the Detail community has only beooiae the more confir;ued and confi dent in its passive obstruction, through the hhaiich, &amp; the leant advance. In fact such movement as there has been, has been retrograde for whereas no definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved t^aropsans for business purposes, the ihalfch has made the •Hyacinth** incident a pretext for refusing admission to any j uropean or quasi- European, even as agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company*s steamers; and I am convinced that until we do put ouv foot down to checit this factitious obstruction we shall make no headway.• The statements made by Sir t# ercy cox are still true. The Residency Agent is of the greatest assistance in most matters; but he ie still unable to fores through the larger issues of British policy• On the other hand, our experience at Bahrain* where the Government of inaia's!j p|^ attempt to pursue a cautious policy failed and finally an ultimatum, backed by force, had to be issued* shows that even British officers find it impossible s*metimes to beat down the stubborn obstinacy of Arab Chiefs and their •oamorra 1 *. 11 . I have consulted the Senior Havnl Officer, Serbianb •* iu- RerBiun Gulf DlTision. who is in icimcdiate touch with tht Trucial Chief*. In the coume of hi* reply to my enquiry h* wrote s- officer * 0 both in days of ermile* euni crimes 0 the Trucial Arabs have developed a sort of friendship towards them* tfiich they do not feel towards other Europeans; but the nhaiith of J'ubai last year would not agree to naval officers* landing to look around the town, unless accompanied by armed guards sup- plied by Isa or himself. The Trucial chiefs are definitely suspicious of anything which to them appears as the thin edge of the European wedge poking its nose into their territories, ana any Innovation will certainly be resisted though not by any means necessarily at once or by open methods. They object to motor cars ant. motor boats, though Isa. by patient persuasion, has .prevailed upon them to allow him to possess both* They object to such ideas as post offices ami wireless, but when the slow mail calls at Thibai she receives letters to carry and the wireless Operator receives bundles of messages to send. The frankly regard Bahrain as a typical example of the grasping hand of Britain hich. being given an inch, finally obtained josscs- ion of the whole place. Vhethtr they are truly independent or not, they have a sturdy spirit of in- depcndenc* as regards determination to control their own affairs; and the first Shaikh who admits a political agent to be quartered upon him will be regarded as having sold his birthright. IS any if not most of our steps in our progress towards develoi in^ control of the Coast, have been made by way of punishsient (e.&amp;. permission for loa to fly the juok at nhargah} and this is known to the Arabs; in factfact, a shaikh can at tinea keep hio people under control by renlnuin*, them that if they do anything disliked by the Government the penalty will be •one greater measure of Government control. Consequently the appointment of a tilitieul Agent would be received ae a serious punislirmnt• w 1 have made this long quotation from the Senior naval Officer’s opinion for comparison with Sir Btrey Goa’s views of 1913 as* together, they form an admirable summing up of the present situation. Kacept in the improved relations between the havy one the Arab 'haikhs, there has been no material alteration in the past sixteen years. 'Kurc^ans* are etill vigorously excluded from the Coast. The prohibition has very occasionally been modified to admit of short professional visits by American missionary doctors, but applies even to the Kuropean ptmrl merchant, «. &lt;©eer»thal. whose presence, last year, as a competitor to ftoha&amp;md All £aiviai, would have been of the greatest benefit to the pearl traders of rubai. one of the reasons for the revolution in Dubai, which was attempted by the .Shaikh’s family last April, was the circulation of a story that the ruling Hhaikh had gi*tm pcnal.Blon U&gt; Kr tStrm. (’toprraentativc of tJi. Standard Cil Company) xo .tay ashore for a nigiit In Dubai while the mall ship was anchored off the coast. We signed the inclusive Agreemnts of 1898 owing to our desire to exclude the '’Tench, ana they hare been useful to us. the shaikhs msluoaeu th. Agree- raent. a. they accorded no well with their own incllna- tiene; and after 1911 they have sealeuely enforced the policy against ourselves. It is our object now to modify this unwelcome development. Although X do not consider it an argument for upsetting*[[ H ; n h. upsetting shat has been done there (see «y Xmtxvr wo. 266-ft. of the 2hth August 1929), 1 agree with Uke Senior Kasai Officer that the example of haicrain ie before Urniie people»’ eyes. In the future this should be a civilising force, but at preeent the fear of loeing their independence is a very rcajor question and it is the greatest deterrent to permitting ruropeans the slightest footing in their land. After all, are the halkhe wrong from their point of view ? They are anxious to preserve their valued independence and have not yet experienced the advantages of civilisation. If they permit close contact, shat will be their fate ? A weak barbarian state in clowe contact with a strong civilised one must sooner or later be absorbed or become a dependency, however much the stronger may desire to JM#pj avoid this course. '“he history of the growth of British power in India is proof of this. 12. A British political Agent, althourJti our treatiol of 1820 give ue the right to appoint him, wauls have to be forced on the Shaikhs, and the political Agent would have to be protested by an armed guard. It should be noted that cur Arab Agent maintains an armed guard at his own expense. The proximity of iueee convenient folk-the Bedouins-would always, in tit* rnaikh'a mind, be a ready excuse for any 'unfortunate incident** that hap penned tut hi first ^slltical Agent. Owing to the maritime life of the count towns, the Bavy can deal with recalcitrance, and their action, ~/Kjl frf possibly with^tho meyaTAir 'orce, would so greatly ex ceed the hitherto mild discipline which they have occai ionally administered that there would be no repeti tion of any unfortunate uooident 'due to bedouins, whom you know we cannot control**; but this would uw poor con*^ *gelation for the first 'eliticol A^ent- 1 do not say that the first Jtoliticol A&amp;cnt would necessarily he nurtiered either at once or in ths long run, but it ie a possibility which rauet Vje consic er~ ed. 1 am sure that a British rolitjcal Agent would Increase British influence on this Coast* and smooth all difficulties in the way of ths air service. These difficulties* owing to the settled Arab policy ef exclusion* are considerable. If the Arabs continue their obstruction — and the air route ie of vital im portance and must be established iuiQfcly # «'- 1 recomaend- that we force then to grant the necessary facilities one at the some time force then to accept a British Political Agent to ensure that there will be no back- eliding. The amount of pressure required should not be excessive. Owing to the marl tine position of the town the Bavy could soon force any policy desired. the Arabs might threaten to emigrate as they did after the ‘♦Hyacinth’* Incident; but if a traoi/q: centre^ ouch as I ut&gt;ai^ were selected as iie site ax for the new agency* the Arab move should not be more than a trifling annoy ance * Heliauk ar«d his followers would go,but the Indian* Persian and Halueh trading community* after a protest that they itad been ruined, would remain and prosper. AAx If time presses a policy of pressure must be adopted; but X prefer^* slower ano more gradual «wthod ahould be tried. 13. The Coast and its Chalkhs are ap^armtly con tent to live in the seventh century; but owing to the ^ /K example of Bahrain there are m. faintestIrring in the dr; bones. Tws years ago, ths entry of modern invention was prohibited* but now ths !thaiich of Kas al hiiaimah is enquiring 4t Mi\ * ! - 12 - is •nqulrlng about a P'ord oar, and ftaa been it r a i in a flying boat; tl* 3halkh of Pubal haa purebaaod a motor launch for hlmaolf; tho richeat and ratiot influential merchant of Abu Ttoabi hae aloo purchaaed a launch; and enquiries* are being rmde otiether Khalil Kanoo f oi jiaaraiiit can bring hio water-boring apparatuo to the Coaot. Theoe are wmll wattero. but the progreoei** Bahrain is having otw»e effect on this benighted count* x think it should be poo Bible to take advantage of any advance that way be made, but the firot deoideratua io to reotort that personal touch which vanished after 1910* 14 , hefore the unfortunate ’•Hyacinth’* incident of 1910 f the pertional influence of nir vircy Con had gone far to break down the barriero of reoerve and suspicion; but the whole position gained was lost by that unfortu nate episode, and it has never been recovered. no successor has occupied the position of :'lr *sr«jr Cox and, during a recent flying boat visit to Abu Dhabi. Captain '*rier was surprised to find that not even the name of a single successor of 'Kekus 1 ' is known in that town* This is due to lack of touch and tills lack of touch was due first to the preoccupation of the wa* and subsequently t# the withdrawal of the hesident’s despatch vessel. To maintain touch with x* his large maritime coiaraand, the nssident »ust have a despatch vessel, at the disposal solely of himself and his ©iiticai Agents. It is im possible for bin to shore this vessel with any other department, as was shown idien an attempt was made to make the same ship serve the double purpose of despatch vessel end tencer to the lighthouses* Having obtained the despatch vessel, super vision over the work of the .’iesidency Agent on the Trueial Coast should be entrusted to the ^litical Agent at Bahrain, who should be relieved of routine work by\ by his Indian Assistant, *hs 'oiiticai nay be supplemented, if necessary, by the l$caretar|i te the esideut. CU(^ The lit!sal nust visit sash rrusiul shaikh at least every quarter and be prepared, if necessary, to make a lon^ halt off eacdu town. At present tJie dissident pays one, or at most two, visits of one day's duration each year, This is insufficient to sru^uirs thoroughly into all problems, and ths Kesiccney Agent*s recoweendations are perforce accepted. Rntpiiries regarding the various monetary claims of britJ^C subjects and into the diving debts of so-called debtors, sho are usually slaves who have absconded to Bahrain, will give the i-biitical Agent plenty of excuse for his presence. In addition J um hearing most disquietis^ xrxax reports about the prevalence of the slave trade on this Coast, and 1 anticipate that searching enquiries may have to be made. At first ths f'olitieal Agent must return to his ship each night; but in the course of time as he becomes better known and confidence is established, 1 hop* he will be Invited te ©tay ashore for ever lengthening periods. 15. My policy is gradually to restore, an© im prove on, the position which existed before the •H; acinth* episode when, as rir ercy Cox reported; 'no definite objection was ever evinced to Urn occasional sojourn of approved l uropeans'. Having regained this position we cun more easily, shourd we no desire, locate a British •oiltleal Vgent ashore without fear of trouble. This policy is to be adopted if the Truclal rttmlkhs do not compel us to take sterner measures to fores through our air route. At present the : huikh of Has «1 Khaim ah is showing himself obstinate in his refusalrefusal of all rcqueeta for a refuelling elation at hie headquarters. The Shaiich of iiamariyah, a depend ency of fthargah, howeTer, has offered to i'rnt a otore- room for th. ub. of the oyal Air -ore. hi. lagoon should prove useful to thca as a flying boat liarbour. The example of this p»haikh # Abdul Rahiman bin :ait 9 will prove of use in breaking down the opposition of others * on the Count t and the question of obtaining store-rooms will become one of pounds, shillings and pence. - Royal Air ^orce will not be content with store-house s however. They desire to have aerodroraes, wireless stations and resthouses. The erection of a wireless station formed part . st / of the ultimatum to the Cliaikh of nubai in 1911, was subsequently allowed to lapse. The Hoyal Air Koree wish to settle on this Coast and this means closer contact JtxXj with the coast Arabs. I hate in paragraph 11 otatdd the final result of close contact between a strong civil* ised power and a weak barbarian state. 16. The Government of India do not desire increas ed commitments, but they are bound to come. His Majesty’s Government must be prepared, in course of time, to protect their friendly shaikhs by armed force against attack by land or sea. The position of the Truslal xfcauddunc principalities, «hich have a hinterland of desert, should make this a comparllively easy task; but it is an unfortunate fact that the closer the contact with the British power the more defenceless do theA rulers become and, consequ«*xitly, the more dependent on British sup ort. This however i* for the future. &gt;*or tne present, in connection with the air route, X anticipate no great trouble in obtaining store-houses for petrol, but difficulties will increase when we demand wireless stations manned by a permanent staff. The Residency AgentAgent Is sufficient to met. the initial deraande of the ?toy«a Air tforc«; but as tiisa* increase* ttit need fur a re«i&lt;ient J^Dlitical At^ent will Increase.

Oovernment in the Persian Gulf, the Air Council are In general agreement with the Residents view. In so far as the difficulties of doing so are increased by the lack of transport, to which reference Is made in paragraph 4 of his despatch, the Council would observe that the presence of the Flying Boat Squadron in the Persian Qul^ should to a material extent ' remedy the lack of political contact which has in the past existed owing to the slowness and discomfort of transport arrangements, ihe utilisation of aircraft should enable The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W.l.i I Your obedient Servant, t visits to be made at more frequent intervals by Political Officers to the areas for which they are responsible.

Government in case of need, ‘ihis \ consideration should considerably strengthen the position of the Political Officers in these areas. The Air Council naturally view with favour any measures which will tend to the provision and easy operation of air routes along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf and they trust that the Resident will appreciate that the aircraft from No. 5203 Plying Boat Sauadron will readily be placed at the disposal of himself or his subordinate officers for carrying out visits in the areas for which they are responsible, and they suggest that the potentialities of the existing political organisation in the Gulf may be by these means so increased as to avoid the necessity of increasing the number of Political Officers employed in the *ulf. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office and India Office. I am. Sir,Register No. $ Minute Paper. p. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.POLITICAL Department. reporting the succession by murder of Sheikh Shakhbuth bin Sultan as Chief of Abu Dhabi, commented on the fact that his predecessor was&lt; the third brother in succession who had been murdered, and on each occasion by a brother, added that it was practically inevitable that this series of murders would continue with monotonous regularity, and that it was for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government whether, in the general interest of humanity, the Political Resident should not take a more active interest in the matter, especially as security at Abu Dhabi was necessary for the maintenance of our air route to India. Sir Lionel Haworth made certain suggestions to this end, which the Government of India on 13th June, 1928 (P. 3410/28), invited him to explain more fully. Sir Frederick Johnston's very interesting despatch of 23rd April examines the situation as a whole. The Department cannot but feel that there is much force in the arguments which he employs,that in * | places such as the Trucial Coast Sheikhs must stand on their own feet, and that the only alternative to a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Sheikhs is practical annexation. It is clearly regrettable that Rulers with whom we are in treaty relations should consistently succeed by the assassination of their predecessors; but unless we are prepared to take over the responsibility for securing the succession, which the Government of India and His Majesty's Government have in the past been reluctant/ 3222a 5000 11/28In+f reluctant to assume, there tE no alternative to this. Moreover, in dealing with semi-civilised persons such as the Trucial Sheikhs, it is a little hard to apply * wholly ' r, estern standards. The particular interest of Sir Frederick Johnston’s despatch is, however, the remarks he makes in paragraph 4 and following on the wider question of ijhe general policy of His Majesty’s Government on the Arabian side. 'It will be seen that the tentative conclusion to which he is inclined is that there might be advantage in the maintenance of a political officer &lt; /V as Political Agent on the Trucial coast, in substituting t for, or in direct control of, the Residency Agent at Shargah. It is unnecessary to summarise his arguments. But as the point may be of considerable interest in connection with the development of the air route on the Arab littoral which is now engaging attention here, and as the Colonial Office, Foreign Office and Air Ministry have had copies of this despatch and may draw attention to the points covered by it in the Warren Fisher Commit or the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, it seems desirable ask without delay for an expression of the views on it of the Government of India, and possibly of the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whose expert qualifications Sir Frederick Johnston pays a tribute.

Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 56-N., dated the lith June 19BB, to \*.hich you have just called attention in your letter No. F.58-NA'&lt;3 of the 9th April 1929. The suggestions for checking the series of murders in the Shaikh family of Abu Dhabi emanated from my predecessor who apparently found the practical im position of any remedy to ue impossible without the assumption of a very much greater amount of internal control than is consistent v^ith His Majesty^ Government policy on the Trucial Coast, ana, I am informed, delayed his reply in the hope that the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence woula result in the policy of e greater degree of interference in the Trucial Coast internal affairs. 3 , History will, 1 think, show few Societies which have not passed through the stage of the assump tion of power by murder. That it is inhumane every oney , P dealings with the Trucial Chiefs leads ae to thi Jt that possibly both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, and that tr.ere is a complete absence of real political touch. ^he political duties on the Truci-i Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself an Arab and rs such liable to Arab intrigues ana partisanship.

Telegraphic communication can only be made through Henjrm by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. ihc Resident an only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the Coast with possibilities of Wahabi aggression and the prospect cf opening up an sir service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time political agent and. to instal there telegraphic or ?;ire- iess communication. The Shaikhs -ire in general well disposed and as life is mainly maritime there is always present in the Navy an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. A capable officer provided with a small but seaworthy launch in which he could visit the outlying Shaikhdoms seems to be the only means by wtaio we can maintain real political touch with the Trucial Coast and efficiently arrange and maintain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. The case is similar regards Qatar and t seems to be a matter for consideration whe her closer and more definite arrangements should not be made with this Shaikhdom under the political advice of the Political clF 4 Political Agent it Bahrain, Until some change is made on the lines above I can see little prospect oi* any satisfactory ox* sale arrangement for aeriax i'lignt on tne ^rab littoral.

Tne suggestions for checking tne series of murders in the Shaikh family of Abu Dnabi emanated from my predecessor who apparently found tne practical imposition of any remedy to be impossible witnout the assumption of a very mucn greater amount of internal control than is consistent with his hajesty^ Governments policy on txie Prucial Coast, and, I air informed, delayed his reply in the hope that tne deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence would result in the policy of a greater degree of interference in the Trucial Coast internal affairs. 3. History wil, I think, show few Societies which have not passed through the stage of the assumption of power murder. That it is inhumane every one will admit, but there are many things going on on tne Arab Coast that are much more inhumane, and the murder of a ohaikn is only a symptom of a primitive state of affairs from which development must be gradual and which cannot be altered by the mere suppression of taat symptom. Though there may be possibly some sympathy for the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for mis successorssuccessors in the blood stained line. They know exactly the contract tiey xre takin : on. As a natter of policy the results of inter ference in successions are very clearly set forth in para ;raph 3 of despatch To. 13 of 1927. If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions of thought throughout the world, .and tne only nope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab Coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and tne advantages of social stability. So long as these xx violent changes do not affect tne live and security of British subjects, I fail to see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of view of an alien scnool of tnought. 4. As regards the wider question of our general policy on the Arabian siie, I feel that with the short period of my tenure here and tne small opportunity I have had owing to difficulties of transport of studying on the spot the problems existing there, any views I express can only be of value as the result of the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of administration under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan i rontier. Such experience as I nave obtained of our dealings with the Trucial Cxiiefs leads me to think possibly both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, ani that there is a complete absence of real polit cal touch. The political duties on the .rucial Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself an Arabjland as such liable to Arab intrigues and partisanship. He lives at Shargahsome eight miles from Dabai where the mail steamer calls onoe a fortni it. Telegraphic communication can only be made through henjam by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. The Resident can only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the Coast with possibilities of ./anabi aggression and the prospect of opening up an air service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time political a'^ent and to instal there telegraphic or wire less communication. The Shaikhs are in general well disposed and as life is mainly maritime tnere is always present in the Davy an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. A capable officer provided with a small but seaworthy launcn in which he could visit the outlying Shaikndoms seems to be the only means by w.aich we can maintain real political toucn with the Trucial Coast and efficiently arrange and maintain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. The case is similar as regards Qatar and it seems to be a matter for consideration whether closer and more definite arrangements should not be made with this Shaikhdom under the political advice of the Political Agent at Bahrain. Until some change is made on the lines above I can see little prospect of any satisfactory or safe arrangement for aerial flight on the Arab iixxaxaii littoral. Possibly, now that he has apparently dealt : satisfactorily with his recalcitrant i'a j d tribes, Bin Saud may be able to take a more liberal view of flights over the ilasa Coast, but in any case the distance between Kuwait and Bahrain is not great. Purther downdown liowever tiiere v/ould appsar to be an svei i'^q in in , risk of trouble unless the position is made more definite and consolidated* Both as regards the Trucial Coast and the 5. larger Shaikndoms there v/ould appear to be a consider able element of doubt as to how far the policy which is formally and publicly enunciated is being actually carried out and whether it is not now advisaole uo review that policy witn regard to actual conditions and need I extract the following from an article in an American Ilagazine. M l£ascat is a British protectorate. qatar, as well as Trucial Oman on the itenxK P^isian Gulf, is a British sphere of influence. Bahrain is practically a Crown Colony, and Koweit is bound by treaty to take advice and receive protection from the British Government. There is little exaggeration here, but it differs substantially in actuality from our theoretical position. I cannot but think that many of the difficulties 6 • we are now encountering on the Persian side of tne Gulf would have been obviated had we taken earlier stock of our position and regularised and consolidated it when that position enabled us to do so, and there seems a possibility that eventually With the growing power of Bin Saud, or some other form of Arab nationalism, the time might come when failure to consolidate and regularise our claims in a more definite and less veiled manner leave us to be shorn of privileges which we had long enjoyed but which we had failed to make sufficiently regular to stand before a diplomatic court. I put forward these opinions with due deference recognising that their only value is the relative one expre ssedV ^'7 ' expressed at tne beginning of paragraph 4 aoove. for that reason they may possibly merit further examination by an expert and I can think of no one better suited to do so than the officer who is to take over charge from me, Colonel Barrett, who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral. 7 . x copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies.

The Foreign secretary, Foreign and Political Department, Government of India, Delhi We liave the honour to submit this representation on behalf of our clients Messrs. Khupchsnd Damoder and uo, and Ratanchand Tarachand, Merchants doing business in Persian Uulf. Our clients Khupchand Damoder and Co &gt; had advanced Rs.21,000/- and our client Ratanchand Tarachand Rs.12,600/- to Arab liasar bin Rashid, a Pearl Merchant at Chharga. it was stipulated that these advances should be repaid in two instal ments but the Debtor failed to carry out the stipulation. Thereafter through the intervention of certain Arab friends, it was arranged that the advances should be repaid in 3 equal instalments. The first of such instalment was to be paid immediately, the second in April 1926 and the third in July 1926. The Debtor however made default in payment of the 2nd and 3rd instalments due to our said clients Khupchand Damoder and Co., and he failed to pay the whole of the 1st instalment due to our client Ratanchand Tarachand. After repeated ineffectual demands for payment, our clients submitted their case to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in Persian Gulf and he was pleased to intimate by his secretary's letter dated the 2 9th day of October 1927 bearing ho.2360, that he would enquire in the matter in the following month on the spot, and did so, , when it transpired that one Damoderdas Tricumdas was indebted to our clients said Debtor Kasar bin Rashid and our clients understand that the said Damoderdas Tricumdas has been orders, not to leave the Port until he settled with his Creditor the said hasar bin Rashid and paid him the amount due, but nothing further was done and our clients were informed that the orders of the Political Resident would be communicated to them by the ResidencyResidency Agent. Our clients find that though considerable time has elapsed, they have not been favoured with the long expected orders and the payment of the monies due to them has still been withheld* Thereafter on the 1st day of February 1928, our clients instructed us to address a letter to the Political Resident wherein we staged the said facts and pointed out that it was believed that the matter of Damoderdas Tricumdas at the said enquiry, was deliberately introduced by the said Rasar bin Rashid with a view to cause further delay in payment to our clients though it had nothing whatever to do with their respective claims and added that our clients were informed that the said Uasar bin Rashid was in possession of ample means and was in a. position to discharge his debts but not only had he been wilfully delaying the payment but with a view to defeat our clients claim, our clients understood, he had been mortgaging his Pearl fishery boats and was likely to do away with his other property unless he was compelled to satisfy our clients claim at an early date, we further stated in our said letter that the balance due by the said Jsasar bin Rashid to our clients Khupchand Damoder and Go., was Ks• 16,100/* made up of Rs.14,000/- for principal and Ks .2,100/- for interest calculated upto the end of December 1926 and that the balance due to our client Ratanchand Tarachand was Rs.10,200/- msde up of Rs.9000/- for principal and Rs.1260/- for interest calculated upto the end of December 1926 and added that the said Nasar bin Rashid had been deliberately keeping back the payment and thereby putting our clients to considerable inconvenience and pecuniary loss and requested the Political Resident to take up our clients case at an early date for final disposal and orders for payment against the said Rasarbin Rashid as there was little prospect of the said Uasar bin Rashid discharging the debt due to our clients except by coercive process under the orders of the Political Resident. The Political Resident was pleased to intimate to us by his Secretary’sSecretary^ letter dated the 20th day of February 1928 bearin No.284 of 1928 that the parties resided in a foreign country and consequently orders of the nature suggested by us, could, in law, only be issued by the Ruler of that country and that the matter was then receiving due attention. By our reply dated the 3rd day of April 1928, we were instructed by our clients to point out what no doubt, was well within the knowledge of the Political Resident, that in case of a claim of the British subject against the Arab, the usual procedure was for the Residents office after investigation to pass orders which were forwarded to the Ruler of that country for compliance and action and added that we presumed that the same procedure was intended to be followed in the case of our clients claim whose cases were then receiving Resident*s due attention. As no reply was received to our said letter, we, on the 17th day of May 1928, addressed a reminder to the Political Resident and requested him to inform us of the orders passed by him, as our clients were kept out of a very large amount for a long time, but we have not so far heard from the Political Resident. We are further instructed by our clients to state that the said Nasar bin Rashid has got sufficient moneys in his hands and that he has been deliberately delaying payment of our clients claim. Under these circumstances, we are instructed by our clients to submit that as they have been wilfully kept out of a large sum of money for a considerably long time and no orders have been passed for payment against the said Nasar bin Rashid you will be pleased to take up the matter for final disposal and issue orders for payment against the said Nasar bin Rashid.

It is not proposed in this memorandum to enter in any detail into the internal history of the Trucial States, but rather to deal in a general way with the developments which have taken place in the last 20 years, and tne problems presented by the States as matters stand to-day. 2. The Trucial Chiefs—so-called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them between 1820 and 1853 with llis Majesty’s Government, under which a check was imposed on their internecine strife and their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf—are the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaima, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, Abu Dhabi and El Katr. The last-named Principality, the history of which between 1908 and 1916 is separately dealt with in the Note on p. JJJ, w r as added to the number of the Trucial States consequent on the conclusion* on 3rd November 1916 of a treaty between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government, under which His Majesty’s Government recognised the independence of El Katr and, in return for certain undertakings, extended to it the benefit of the guarantees contained in the Trucial 1 reaties. The territory ruled over by the Trucial Sheikhs at the present day lies on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, between the west side of the Promontory of El Katr (or Qatar) and approximately the north point of the Musandim Promontory in Oman (compare Map II appended to this Memorandum). 3. The Trucial States remain independently administered tribal princi palities, governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties (the substance of which is given in the precis of treaty engagements printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum) accord to the contracting parties the right to accredit a representative on the one side at the headquarters of the several Chiefs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bush ire ; but in practice the Chiefs have no representatives, and His Majesty’s Government are represented only by a native agent of the Residency at Bushire, who is stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, and moves from place to place as required. 4. Responsibility for the political control of the States rested up to the end of the war with the Government of India. The Masterton-Smith Committee made no specific reference to them, but, on the general principle underlying the recommendations of that Committee, the affairs of the States would appear to continue to be primarily the concern of the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty’s Government, save when they involve or touch on major questions of policy involving relations with Ibn Sand, or affecting the Arabian policy of His Majesty’s Government. In that case they fall to be dealt with directly by Ills Majesty's Government through the Colonial Otlice. 5. Save in respect of the Residency Agent at Shargah, there appears to be no political expenditure in connection with the Sheikhs. No subsidies are or have been paid to any of their number, although the grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of El Katr was considered and ultimately rejected in connection with the negotiation of the treaty concluded with him on the 3rd November 1916.| II.—Internal History, 1908-28. 6. The internal history of the Trucial States in the last 20 years is of no general interest or importance, and it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here. The incident of most importance in the pre-war period was an undertaking by the Sheikhs not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions,J save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. During the war the Sheikhs adopted a friendly attitude ; and, broadly speaking, they have satisfactorily implemented their engagements to His MajestyN Government in matters such as the arms traflic and the slave trade. His Majesty’s Government have consistently avoided entanglement in their internal affairs, H P. 268/17. t Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Sept. 9 1915, P. 3296/15.

Oil. 7. In view of the importance of the oil question it should be placed on record that the Tru.cial Sheikhs of Shargah, Has-al-Khaima, i)abai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain agreed in 1922 not to grant a concession in the event of oil being found in their territories, save with the permission of His Majesty's Government. No question of a concession has so far arisen. Considerable discussion has, however, taken place between the Sheikh of El Katr (who is precluded by Article 5 of his Treaty of 3rd December 1916 from granting any concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government), and various oil interests affected in regard to the grant of a concession in his territory : and an option for 18 months in which to negotiate for an oil concession was granted by him to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in March 1926. The negotiations have throughout been conducted under the close supervision and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. III.—External Developments affecting the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28. 8. The developments in relation to the Sheikhs of most importance during the period now in question have been external. They are— (a) The rise of Ibn Saud. (b) The recent reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf. Ibn Saud and the Trucial Sheikhs. 9. As will be seen from the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Wahabi connection with the Trucial Coast is of long standing, although for many years prior to 1913 it had ceased to be of any political importance. But the conquest of Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913 again brought the Wahabi movement directly in touch with the Trucial Sheikhs. 0 To their territory, as to El Katr, Ibn Saud maintained a hereditary claim. He was, however, warned by the Political Resident of the special treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheikhs,! and he maintained an entirely correct attitude towards them during the following years. By the Treaty of 26th December 1915, Ibn Saud undertook to abstain from aggression on or interference with the Trucial Sheikhdoms, or with El Katr,J and that instrument formally governed his relations with the States until tlie conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah in the spring of 1927. 10. No incident of importance appears to have arisen as between Ibn Saud and the Trucial States until after the European War. In 1921§ the Sheikh of El Katr represented that he was alarmed at the prospect of some of his townspeople becoming Akhwan and joining Ibn Saud, and asked whether Government would help him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed in reply that Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance should he be attacked by Ibn Saud. At the end of 1922 the Sheikh again representedj| that, while he did not iear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with His Majesty’s Government, he was seriously alarmed by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to make his position impossible. The Political Resident commented that he did not see any practicable means to prevent peaceful penetration of the country by the Akhwan and Ibn Sand’s adherents. He suggested that a hint might be given to Ibn Saud to keep his people in order. No action was taken on this proposal. Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, reporting^ that, on finding that Ibn Saud was apparently including the Katr Peninsula within the tract of country for which he was prepared to negotiate an oil concession, he had already very recently “ taken him to task, reminding him that he had nothing to do with Katr, except to respect it, under the terms of his treaty with us, and insisting on the limitation of his discussions to the country west of the longitude of Sal wall Bay. His Highness accepted this injunction without argument.” The Sheikh has maintained his independence^though it transpired in the air reconnaissance of the Gulf in 1027 that he attaches great importance to avoiding action which might be unpalatable to the Wahabi King. 11. The activity of the Wahabis again came prominently to notice in 1926. The Political Resident then reported- 0 that of the Trucial Chiefs, the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dabai, together with a number of the tribes under their suzerainty or adjoining their territory, were whole-heartedly opposed to Ibn Sand ; that the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima were definitely supporters of the \\ ahabi King ; and that the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umin al Qaiwain were inclined to be neutral. In a number of instances the Wahabi Governor of llasa, Ibn Jiluwi, appeared to have acted in an extremely high-handed manner in the frucial Sheikhdoms, and the Political Resident was inclined to the view that he aimed at the absorption in Nejd of all Trucial Oman and “ Independent ” Oman (Jau), and at the establish ment of contact with a large district of the Oman Sultanate which was opposed to the Imam and almost independent of the Sultan. 12. An element of doubt existed as to the extent to which Ibn Sand was personally responsible for. or even cognisant of, the activities of the Governor of Hasa; it was decided, after considerable discussion, that no action should be taken in the matter pending the conclusion of the new treaty then in negotiation with him ;t| and the assurances secured in that treaty from the King were ultimately held to dispose of the matter. 13. The Government of India were strongly in favour of the inclusion in the treaty in question of an undertaking as regards the Trucial Chiefs substantially identical with that embodied in the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (see para. 9 above). It proved impossible to secure Ibn Sand’s agreement to this His Majesty’s Government regarded the point as one which it was undesirable to press too far, and in the result the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, in the treaty signed at Jeddah on 20th May 1927, undertook merely 44 to maintain iriendiy and peaceful relations with . . . the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government.” 14. The result of the reconnaissance undertaken in connection with the air route in the Persian Gulf along the north Arabian shore in the spring of 1927 was to show that the influence of Ibn Sand had increased in a very marked manner along the north Arabian littoral, and considerable difficulties were placed in the way of the reconnaissance on the ground, either expressed or implied, that political difficulties would be caused with the Wahabis and the Wahabi King by the landing of aeroplanes, Ac. (cp. Note on Air Communications in the Gulf on p. S|j. So impressed was the Political Resident by the rise of the Wahabi power and by the insecurity to which a chain of air stations along the Arab coast might be exposed by internal dissensions and the danger of Wahabi interference in the petty Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, that in the spring of 1927 he suggested 0 that the long-established policy of abstention by His Majesty’s Government from all but naval commitments should now be discarded and replaced by a definite assumption of responsibility in the States concerned for the orderly succession of Sheikh to Sheikh, for his maintenance in power, and for the protection of his territories by land as well as by sea. 15. The Government of India gave careful and sympathetic consideration to the Resident’s proposals. But the conclusion at which the}* finally arrivedt was that, even though the guarantees of non-interference given by Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 fell considerably short of those which he had been prepared to accept in 1915, they conveyed to the King of the Hejaz a clear intimation, solemnly accepted by him, of the special position and of the interest in the Trucial Sheikhdoms of liis Majesty s Government. Past history, in the view of the Government of India, justified them in relying for security against, the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Sand had entered with His Majesty’s Government, and, while it was impossible to forecast the effect on Gulf politics of the death of Ibn Sand, they were not prepared, in these circum stances, to make an immediate reversal of their policy in the Persian Gulf Letter from Pol.

Should a more definite assertion be called for by subsequent developments, that assertion ' could be made and enforced on the basis of our existing political position and sea power.” As to the air route, they regarded its establishment along the Arab littoral, should a decision to this end be reached, as both possible and advisable without any alteration in “our old and well-tried Gulf policy.” 1 hey added that the mere presence of an aerodrome would, to some extent, afford a visible guarantee of British protection, but indicated that some subsidy to the Sheikhs in whose territories the aerodromes would lie or over whose territories the air route would pass would probably be necessary. The reassertion of Persian Authority in the Persian Gulf. 16. It is only in the last two years that Persia has commenced to adopt an active policy in the Gulf. The result of the adoption of that policy has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with the Trucial Chiefs and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the south Persian coast, the occupation of Henjam for so many years by Trucial Arabs, the Trucial ownership of the islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, the title to which of the Sheikhs of Shargah and Kas-al-Khaima is contested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. 17. The three most important incidents which have arisen are the expulsion by Persia of the Sheikh of Henjam in May 1928, the arrest in duly 1928 of a Trucial dhow plying between Dabai and Khassab, which raised the question of the status of Tamb, and—a direct consequence of the last-named incident—the questioning by Persia of the independence of the Trucial owners of Tamb. 18. The history of the expulsion of the Sheikh of Henjam is giren in paras. 28 to 84 of the Memorandum on llenjam on page The incident was one the disposal of which would, in all probability, have presented relatively little difficulty, had it been possible to localise it. But the Sheikh of Henjam is the father-in-law of the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai; and he and his people are by race Jowasimi Arabs, who claim never to have accepted Persian nationality, and who maintain very close relations with their fellow tribesmen on the north Arabian shore.As a result, disturbances in Henjam react immediately on feeling on the Trucial Coast, and in the present instance the effect of the expulsion of the Sheikh was, according to the Senior Naval Officer, so greatly to excite the Trucial Arabs that they had stated that were it not for “ tlie British action and our gunboats, they would come in thousands, seize Kishm Island and Henjam, and kill every Persian on the islands.”! Representations in the strongest terms were made to the Residency Agent and the Political Resident, and Sir Lionel 1 faworth reported that he had been informed by the brother of the Sheikh of Dabai, whom he describes as one of the most level-headed and sensible chiefs on the Trucial Coast, that “if we did nothing to help them, they were prepared to tear up our treaties, much as they liked them, have done with our air route and kill all Persian officials they could and massacre all Persians on the Arab coast.” 19. As will be seen from the Memorandum on Henjam, it was agreed, in the early stages of this incident, that the intervention of His Majesty’s Government at Tehran on behalf of the Sheikh would do more harm than good.! r l he strength of feeling aroused on the Arab littoral, and the danger emphasised by the Political Resident—that the Trucial Arabs might have recourse to Ibn Saud should His Majesty’s Government, while failino- themselves to intervene effectively on behalf of the Sheikh, refuse to allow the Sheikh of Dabai to approach the Persian Government regard mo- him have since, however, led the Government of India to modify their view! ni l’ s,'e. 1 527 n &lt;,,&gt;r Attention has also been drawn by the Colonial Office to the difficulties which would arise were the Trucial Arabs to become supporters of Ibn Saud, and while for the moment the return of the Sheikh to Henjam at the invitation of the Persian Government gives hope that a satisfactory solution of the incident may be found, reconsideration of the decision of His Majesty’s Government not to intervene with Persia may be called for should this * Pol.

The Charge d’Affaires at Teheian was, however, instructed in reply to communicate officially the text ol the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 with all the Trucial Chiefs, and to state that His Majesty’s Government entirely. failed to understand the 1 ersian statement, and could not admit direct dealings between the Chiefs ar t ( thej’ersmn Government. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added, . You will realise that vis-d-vis of Foreign Powers there is no distinction for a purpose like the present between the Sheikh of Ras-al- Khaima and the other Trucial Chiefs, and effect of Persian Note is to challenge our right to protect any of them from external aggression the status of His Majesty s Government on the Arabian coast is not open to discussion, nor can they recognise any Persian claim on that side of the Gull.

It seems clear in the circumstances that the possibility of a formal claim by Persia to suzerainty on the Trucial Coast whether based on her temporary control of portions of that coast in the early t cor. i, 631. , . ^ Aue seriousness or me -which such a claim would give rise, if pressed, needs no emphasis. I Lor. i, 737.* 6 IV.—Summary. 24. The extension to the coast of the authority of Ibn Sand and the influence of the Wahabi movement, the reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf, and the question of an Imperial air route along the north Arabian coast, have combined to invest the Trucial Sheikhdoms with a new importance. If the air route is to materialise ; if 11 is Majesty’s Government,, in the light of the report of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, remain of the opinion that the maintenance of British influence in the Gulf is a matter of paramount importance, alike from the Imperial and from the Indian standpoint; and if they are no longer.to enjoy on the south Persian coast the privileged position which they have enjoyed in the past; then the consoli dation of their influence on the north Arabian shore is a matter of very much greater and more definite importance than at any earlier period. 25. If, however, that influence is to be maintained and consolidated, the fact that the Trucial Chiefs are guaranteed (even though to an extent difficult precisely to define) the protection of His Majesty’s Government, and are forbidden to communicate with outside Powers or to receive their representatives, necessitates a clear understanding as to the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are in a position and are prepared to defend their interests, whether against Persia or against Ibn Sand. 26. Of the two, Persia presents the less serious problem. Even should she seriously put forward claims to suzerainty on the Arab coast, she is not, as matters stand, in a position to enforce them, nor could Ris Majesty’s Government acquiesce in her pursuit of an active policy of aggression on the north Arabian coast, any more than in those Trucial islands in the Gulf which they have recognised as vested in the Trucial Chiefs, without resiling from the policy which they have hitherto consistently pursued. Moreover, the Trucial Sheikhs and their tribesmen are bound to Persia by ties neither of race nor of religion, while the north Arabian shore (as distinct from the Trucial islands, certain of which appear to contain valuable mineral deposits) offers no commercial or pecuniary reward to justify an active Persian interest. Letter from P.A., fthrein, to Pol. Res., ;&gt;ril 14 1927 P. 3334/27. 27. Ibn Sand, and the Wahabi movement of which he is the representative, constitute a much more serious problem. In the first place, in the words of Sheikh Hamad of Bahrein, Ibn Saud is “the one big Arab ruler, and it is natural for all the smaller Arab Sheikhs ... to look up to him and try to please him Historically, he has claims of standing to a predominant influence on the Trucial ‘Coast, and geographically his extension to that coast would, but for the presence of His Majesty’s Government, be a natural process. The special tenets of the Wahabi creed are familiar to the Trucial tribesmen; certain at any rate of the Trucial Sheikhdoms are traditionally strongly Wahabi in outlook ; while racial^ the Trucial Arabs and the Wahabis of the interior descend from common stocks. 28. It is clear that in these circumstances the problem of preventing the absorption of the Trucial Sheikhdoms by Ibn Saud or their gradual penetration by Wahabi influence is one of great difficulty, the more so in view of the known Wahabi sentiments of certain of the Trucial Sheikhs. The danger of possible military aggression by the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd may be discounted so long as his general relations with His Majesty’s Government remain friendly, and the Government of India have already expressed the view (see para. 15 above) that they are justified, in the light of past history, in relying for security against the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud has entered with His Majesty’s Government. But while this is true of an aggressive military policy, it appears almost impossible for His Majesty’s Government effectively to prevent the penetration by peaceful means of the Trucial States by Ibn Saud and Ids adherents - a process the more difficult to combat for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. 20. As matters stand, the most that it appears possible for His Majesty’s Government usefully to do is to arrange for the showing of the flag by His Majesty’s ships along the Trucial Coast, possibly to a greater extent even than at present; to construe in a strict sense the undertakings given by7 Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 ; and to keep a close watch for action, whether prompted by Ibn Sand himself or the independent work of over-zealous lieutenants, which can be regarded as calling for remonstrance, in view of the terms of the treaty. The value of the constant reminder of , v British power which is given by a naval patrol cannot be exaggerated ; the importance of the support of His Majesty's ships to a ruler threatened by a fanatical hinterland has been illustrated in recent years, though in different circumstances, in Muscat. The establishment of an air route, should His Majesty’s Government decide upon that course, will go some way towards the assertion on the north Arabian coast of the influence of His Majesty’s Government. The payment of subsidies to the Chiefs, should that prove ultimately unavoidable, in connection with the establishment of air stations, may further be of value in consolidating British influence; the elimination of British influence from the south Persian shore, and the possibility that Persia may question the retention of the Residency at Bushire, may lead to a reconsideration of political arrangements in the Gulf, one effect of which would be to fix the headquarters of the Resident on or near the Arabian littoral of the Gulf; but while for the moment the objections urged by the Government of India to the adoption of the policy of active intervention in the affairs of the Trucial Coast suggested by the Political Resident (para. 1J above) appear conclusive, the possibility that at some later stage consideration of that policy may be necessitated by developments which cannot at present be foreseen, is one which must be faced. 30. To sum up. His Majesty’s Government by their treaty engagements control the foreign relations of the Trucial Chiefs, to whom, in addition, they have promised either directly or by implication a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define. Their written engagements to the Chiefs have been supplemented by utterances such as that made by Lord Curzon, when Viceroy of India, on his visit to the Gulf in 1903, an appeal to the terms of which has so recently as the summer of the present year i:: ' been made by certain of the Chiefs affected. The original reason for contracting the engagements in question was the suppression of piracy, the slave traffic and the arms traffic, and the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf. In the changed circumstances of the present day, those arguments for the maintenance of a predominant British influence are supplemented by the wider political considerations referred to in para. 21 above. But the change in the general situation which has made the maintenance of British influence on the Trucial Coast of greater general importance from the Indian and the Imperial point of view' is accompanied by the probable necessity of facing wider liabilities, or of interpreting in a more generous or a more binding manner the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of the interests of the Sheikhs protected. V.—Points referred to in connection with Deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 31. The following points have been specifically referred to in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee :— (a) On the Arabian coast Koweit and the so-called Trucial Chiefs are continually threatened by Ibn Sand. Is the maintenance of their independence necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 VIII.) (b) Policy of His Majesty’s Government vis-d-vis Ibn Saud, with particular reference to . . . Trucial Chiefs and air route. (P.G. 6, 2 (c), 1.) (c) Policy of His Majesty’s Government towards the Trucial Chiefs (compare Colonel Haw T orth’s proposal for a greater degree of interference and support, with a view to securing that they shall not be absorbed by Ibn Saud). (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 2.) (d) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery (and arms traffic). (P.G. (5, 2 (c), 3.) Lor. i, 2638-9. * Tel. from S.N.O to Adlty., 1739/30 July 30 1928, P.401VI.—Views of the Government of India. 32. The Government of India are definitely of opinion that the alienation of the Arab Protectorates would be highly impolitic from the point of view t Tel. from Viceroy, of His Majesty’s Government,')* and, in connection with the deliberations I ,78 *783 Sept 4 1928 ’ l &gt;ers ^ an Gulf Sub-Committee, have expressed the viewj that the j p. (&lt;. (,. maintenance of the independence of the Sheikhdoms (absorption of which by Ibn Sand or his successor might easily lead to a speedy relapse of the Gulf into the chaos from which it has been rescued with so much difficulty) is essential. Here, as in the case of Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat, they consider that so long as Arab opinion is not alienated by an attempt at undue Westernisation, our present veiled protectorate suffices not only against European encroachment, but against the encroachments of the Wahabi State. That protectorate can, they remark, at need be more explicitly asserted. India Office, 4th October 1928. d. G. T J J.UOiglJiMIAL. Extract from Summary of News from the Arab States ior the month of September, 19S8. 49. BABAL;i AND SIN SAiil) . The sons of the late shaikh of Abu Dhabi Saqar bin ^aid, who recently paid a visit to Hasa and presented 7 camels to Bin Jiluwi the Governor of Hasa, have returned to Aby Dhabi with news that Bin Sand's official Muhammad bin Mansur will soon be once more arriving to turn away the ilunasir fidawis of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and then to go to Baraimi and recover tax from al Bu Shamis, Daru, Awamer, and Munasir beciouins.or transfer of territory to other Powers, and the maintenance of relations with foreign Powers already accepted by those Chiefs. In order to secure the signature of the Sheikh, it was agreed that the articles of the^ treaty (7, 8 and 9) which related to the admission of British subjects to Katr for trading purposes and their protection while so engaged, the admission of an Agent on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and the establishment of * post and telegraph offices in Katr, should remain inoperative for the present, while a minor concession was made in respect of the retention by the Sheikh and his dependents of negro slaves actually in their possession, on the understanding that they w T ould receive “fair and just treatment.” 7. The one respect of importance in which the treaty went beyond the normal type of Trucial treaty was that it contained an undertaking that the good offices of His Majestv’s Government should be granted to the Sheikh in the event of unprovoked aggression against him by land within the territories of Katr (Article XI). The assurance in question did not, however, in practice impose any very serious liability on His Majesty’s Government, as was shown when a tentative appeal was made to it by the Sheikh in 1922 (see para. 9 of Memorandum on the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28, on page 8. The treaty was ratified by the Governor-General of India in Council on 28th March 1918. * The history of Katr from the date of its conclusion is dealt with in the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on page but it may be recorded here that the position of its ruler was recoguised on the conclusion of the European War by the grant to him of the C.I.E. (3rd June 1919) and of a salute of seven guns—honours of which he is the only recipient among the chiefs of the Trucial Coast. India Office, 5th September 1928. J. G.
