'* .MiTTr s Ai'g’&lt; 15 5 Previous papers :— Certain articles of the new Persian Civil Cods which have recently been passed by the Majlis comprise a revised Nationality Law which tacitly replaces the Nationality Law of 1929 (flagged at the bottom of the file)* A translation of the articles in question is enclosed in the Tehran Despatch of 13th May at P.Z.4271/35. The new law is on the same general lines as the old law, but it will be seen from articles 980 and 988 that greater facilities are afforded for obtaining Persian citizenship and still greater difficulties placed in the way of Persian subjects acquiring foreign nationality. The chief modifications and additions to the old law are noted in pencil opposite the relevant articles of the new Civil Code. Note in/ 3330 1000 12.34in particular the first sentence of Article 989 which appears to provide retrospectively that the foreign nationality of any Persian subject who acquired such nationality after the year 1901-02 without observing the 'legal stipulations' (presumably of the present law) will be considered null and void. It is not arybicipated that the provisions of the new code will make the position of British Subjects in Persia who wish to renounce their Persian nationality any worse than it is at present. The provision of the new code to the effect that those who renounce Persian nationality must leave Persia has already been applied to British Subjects. In this connection please see minute at P.Z.5202/33 and the papers on the attached file regarding the treatment of British Subjects at Charbar. The effect of paragraph 5 of article 976 of the de is slightly more lenient to foreign nationals since foreigners born in Persia will not now automatically be regarded as Persian subjects after reaching the age of 18 (as under the old law) until after the expiry of the further year of grace during which it is open to them to adopt the nationality of their fathers.

Wedady proceeded to Tehran for obtaining a final settlement of his case from the Tehran authorities and it is believed that he will not return.n No. 58S. 1934 — - Yember 10th 1953* Sir, With reference to my despatch Ho. 364 of July 26th transmitting a copy of a circular despatch that I had addressed to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia on the subject of the difficulties encountered by British subjects and British protected persons who were endeavouring to divest themselves under Article XIII of the Hationality Law of the Persian nation ality imposed upon them by that law, I have the honour to inform you that for the last few months I have received a stream of complaints from the Kurramis resident in the Caspian provinces regarding their treatment by the Persian authorities, more particularly in matters arising out of their nationality. 2 0 As attempts to deal by correspondence with complaints of this kind coming from ignorant and mostly illiterate persons living at a distance inevitably proved fruitless, and as they finally became so numerous I asked Mr. Trott to make a journey to the principal centre® in which the Kurramis reside and while doing what he could to smooth their path with the local author ities, to explain to them their position under Persian law. 5 # Mr. Trott accordingly spent some days in the Caspian provinces in September and I am as a result indebted to him for an interesting and valuable report upon the position of the — Kurramis. I enclose a copy of this report herein, certain sections dealing with individual cases having been omitted. 4. I feel convinced as a result of Mr. Trotfs investigations that the troubles of the Kurramis are largely due to their failure * The Right Honourable Sir John Simon (J.C.3.I., etc., etc., etc., F0REI0H OFFICE.-2 failure to understand, notwithstanding many efforts hy the Legation to make them do so, that so long as they live in Persia they must conform to Persian laws and regulations whatever their nationality and that in the case of those born in the country their acceptance of sijills will not deprive them of their British nationality. In the great majority of cases they have no recent connexions with the Kurram and will be much better off with Persian nationality than without it. I trust in any case that Mr. Trott’s explanations will have eased the situation. 5. Bven if we accept, as 1 think we must, the fact that the Persian 'concession” about Article XIII is a dead letter and that all the younger generation born in Persia will remain Persian subjects, certain unsatisfactory features remain. These fall roughly into two categories: (a) delay in issuing permis de sejour to those &gt; urramis born outside Persia. (2) the high prices charged for the renewal of permljg de s4.1our . 6. The second is likely to be the most lasting, and is therefore the more serious difficulty. It arises from the. I act that the Foreigner’s Residence Law of June 6th 1931, gives the police unfettered discretion as to the period of validity of any permission they may give to a foreigner to reside in Persia, even when this permission is for 'permanent' residence. The fee for each prolongation of the permission is fixed, but there is no limit to the number of prolongations whicn may be necessary in one year. 7. This difficulty Is, however, one that has already been raised in connexion with British subjects (about whose nation ality there was no question) resident in last Persia, and the hardships-3 hardships that the need for constant prolongations, as well as the need for husband and wife to take out separate p.emis, imposed upon poor persons was represented to the Ministry for Foreign Affaire. These representations have not however had any effect as yet, and though I shall continue to do what is possible I an not hopeful that a systea which is at once advantageous to the exchequer (or the individual police officer) and irksome to the foreigner will easily be suppressed. 8. I am including the expenses of Mr. Trott's Journey in the Extraordinary Accounts of this Legation and trust that covering sanction may be given for the expenditure involved. This Journey also included a visit to Resht for the purpose of arranging certain matters connected with the closing of the Vice-Consulate (see my despatch Mo. 424 of August 28th 19o3, paragraph 16). I regret that there was no time to seek sanction for this journey in advance. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Mo. 218). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your moat obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) V# A.L.MALLET*JOURNEY TO aiLAM, MAEANPKRAN, ARB ASTBBABAB* September 21st to October 2nd 1933* i, Sximmrx* I left Tehran on the 21st September and reached Besht in about 11 hours without incident. Rain began to fall that evening for the first time for about four months» (an unprecedented drought). The rain which fell’did its best to make up for the dry period, as it came down with great severity for four days continuously. Almost all the dwelling houses in Resht had leaking roofs. The Vice—Consulate building was no exceptions all the upper rooms, with one exception, had pools of water in them fro® drippings through the roof* a On the 24th September I started off for Maxanderan. The road was in places completely under water, and when we reached the Safid Rud crossing, some 25 miles from Resht, we discovered a huge torrent of water instead of the small trickle which the river had been hitherto* Half of the now tt Skoda H bridge had been carried away, and the ferry boats would not risk the crossing. I therefore returned to Resht, and started off again on the morning of the 26th September. The crossing this time was possible, afeettt about an hour’s delay, and thereafter the hired car made good time as far as Babul, which I reached at 8 p«m. 5 . On the morning of the 27th X called on the Governor oi Mazanderan, Mufakha® ml Mulk (Mirsa Ahmad Khan Nikpey) and had a talk with him concerning the general questions arising out of the Kurrami problems. He had not heard from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs concerning my mission, but he promised to do his best to sec that they were properly treated in accordance with the law* 4 . I then saw the self-appointed leader of the dari Kurrami community, Meshedi Muhammad Ali, and a number of his confreres. § told them roughly what I had come for? explained more particularly toto Meshedi Muhaasaad All that any British subject applying for a sijill did not necessarily thereby relinquish his British nationality, and leit by train for Bander A Shah, having explained to Meshedi Muhammad All that I would return on Friday the 29th and would then see any member of the Kurrssmi community who wished to have a talk with me, and would do my best to explain any points they liked to raise and to help them generally# g. I reached Bandar i Shah that night, and hired a car for Gurgan (Asterabad) arriving at the house of Hussein Quli Agha, our former agent, about B p*ja.. He entertained me hospitably, and on the following morning I went with him to call on the Governor of the province of Gurgan, and on the chief of Police# e, Governor (Mirsia Hassan Khan Arfa’us Saltaneh) was away in Tehran but his deputy, Asif-i-Akram, received me very kindly and promised to do his best for the Kurramis# I found that he was an old friend, as he used to be the private secretary to the Amir Afsharj but I last saw him in June 1918. The Chief of Police, Sarhang Kaoufi, was equally kind and seemed to know that I was coming# In the afternoon I held a sort of durbar for Kurramis. About twenty of them came to see me, and I saw them one by one, as well as making a few remarks to the® collectively# The results are explained in more detail hereafter: but the chief impression I gathered was that the Kurramis of Gurgan were not in much difficulty# A large number of them had received permis de jour, and although there were some complaints concerning the cost of renewal of perals de s4jour, the real grievance of these people is of course that the acceptance of Persian nationality involves military service for their children# , On Friday the 29th September I caught the train at Bandar i Shah at 7 a#m. and arrived at Sari at 10# 50 a# a. I was met by MeahediMeshedl Muhamsaad All and aoMe other Kurramie at the station, and was hy the* escorted to Meshedi Huhammad All's house, soae distance out of the town. Here I was given lunch, and everyone of that community who wanted to see me case along and had their say. 9 . At Sari no Kurraftl at all has yet received a permis de s^jour. She relevant department say that perads are aoon to he issued, hut non© iiixv© acfeiiEiHy 13 ©©b lssu©&lt;i as yet*^ 10. In the afternoon I went hy ear to Shahi, and saw 3eyyid kahi* and other members of the Kurrami community there. Most of them live in one part of Shahi, and their chief complaint is conce ned with arbitrary notices issued hy the head of the Municipality at Shahi, saying that, for example, householders must put tin roofs on tr.eir houses within a week, etcetera. The Kurramla who made this comp laint told me at first that these orders applied only to them; hut hy dint of further enquiries I found that this was not so, the orders in question applied to everybody in that district. 11 . I called on Sarhang Suhelli, the head of the Police at Shahi. He told me that he had had Instructions about me fro* Tehran. X told him the reasons for my visit, and we discussed the legal questions involved. He had only just taken over the post, and so had no local knowledge. X gave him the names of the principal JJ Kurramis, told him that certain specified ones wished to have permis de s4jour hut had not yet received them, and generally invoked his good offices in seeing that .hey got a fair dmal. H* was very attentive and promised to do hia best for the*. 19* Perhaps the most important case at Shahi is that of Safdar -iw . o _ A -j.. c ’below): however the aggrieved Ali, Mar dan Ali, and Salman Ali {me ^ oeiow;, persons, after having been warned, that I was coming, did not take the trouble to come and see me, so I was able to do nothing. I heard a good deal about the case however, as recorded below. No one mentioned the M’s Interest in the property. The impression X received was that the Governor of Shat* named Sey/id Huzoor,was at the hottoa of all that trouble* he appears to be a poisonous individual who needs suppressing* However, Meshedi Muha^aad Ali tells me that he (Seyyid Huzoor) has been slapped in the face pub licly by the head of the Nazmiyeh at Shahi more than once, so his authority does not seem to be very great, and I expect the Kurraiais will bank more on the head of the Hazmiyeh in future. The Kurraais in Amul had all gone off temporarily elsewhere 15* so I did not visit that place. At Babul there was nobody of importance. I stayed at Babul that night. The following day, September 30th, I returned to Resht in 14* a hired car. The road was in very good condition and the spate in the Bafid Bud had diminished* On October 1st I burnt some of the Resht archives and packed 1&amp; * W up the mouldering documents from the Bank safe, oring iRisa, a ith some others, to Tehran next day* Some notes on the road and on the Resht Yice—Consulate have 16. been submitted separately* B. ^urramll«*»0 K 112 * 2 *&amp;ib t wif© • son ^onn in uui*gan» aays that^he Police Departaeit are plaguing hia to take out to take-out a siJIU &lt;aa d wil1 not give him a P*™ 1 * d ® Jour.

(d) The fact that a British subject, who was by Persian Law a Persian subject, applied for a 'sijlll' *1* not mean that that individual thereby renounced his British nationality, the latter ^ Aviealt es 11S£f%flll &amp;S b©fOr© In Sll COU2X would remain, and would he just as ries except Persia* 21.

If this was not carried out within aeven days penalities would p e involved. The Eurraml community regarded this as a hit at them, as the order applied to the district in which most of them lived, and it was impossible of performance within the time. X found out, however, that the order was of a general nature; and that everybody was complaining of ita harfchnees and impossibility of fulfilment.

This account seems rather mysterious and seems to show that Seyyid-i-Husoor is a crook; but I have an idea that the three Kurramis were somehow ss&amp;ing close to the wind and the fact that they agreed to this compromise, and did not complain about it to the Legation, nor come to see me about it, seems to show that there is more in this case than meets the eye.i 9 D* IteshU Complaint Qi two inaim . 8uM..ect 8a, 25* Meshedi Ahmad Sargar Hindi, and his brother Meshedi Ibrahim larger Hindi, are two brothers, aged respectively 60 and 50 or so, who were born in Hesht and have lived there all their lives* Their father was Haji Ramazan Ali, an/l Indian who migrated to Resht some 70 years ago and died a short time ago at the ripe age of 100.

Summary ot!♦ Summary of Conciasiona gonsemlng Ku rraais*^ S6» I think that my journey waa not without value, though it may have the result of hringing matters to a head; i.e., the Kurramis near the Caspian Sea will have to realise that the Persian Government is aoing all it can to force the Kurramis uq take out Persian nationality papers, or else to leave the country. I doubt very much whether in fact many ox them will leave© A number of them have already applied for Persian nation ality papers, and one cannot blame them® I remember a very cheerful old gentleman at Gurg^, a ”saqql if or water carrier by trade, who told me quite happily that he had had n sijill for some time and did’nt have any trouble with it; he still looks upon himself as a Kurrami, however© 2?© Apart from Seyyid Huzoor the Governor of Shahi, who I suspect of being a thoroughly venal type of man, I do not think any of the local authorities are oppressing the Kurr&amp;mis to any great extent# The local people merely do what they are told by the Tehran offices# The real trouble arises from people Ilk© | pourevali in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who are determined to have the Kurramis as Persians or not at all# SB. Pressure from Tehran is put on these people in Tarious ways. At Gurgan permis de a£jour have been granted, hut large fees are taken for their renewal every quarter. At Sari and Shahi no permis de s^jour have yet been issued; I suppose it is hoped that in virtue of the long delay the Kurramis will lose heart and take sijills* 29, Whether it is in the long run advisable to protest agains' these low tricks is a moot point. It is not obvious that any advantage will result from any action that we may take; we have to acquiesce in the eventual right of the Persians to expel these people from Persia if ever and whenever they like. 30, But••IX# 30. But X think wc should take every suitable opportunity of rubbing in to Pourevali and the others that we realise what low tricks they are playing. 31.

Por instance, in the case of descendants of a -.Punjabi who happened, for example, to have been bom in Persia, we do not know what other description could be given them/ .

(Telegram from G.of I. to Tehran dated 15th Dec. 1932 - P.Z,7651/32). They now state that they have no objection uo the adoption of Mr. Hoare's suggestions in the case of other British Protected Persons of Indian origin, ii it is established that such persons are in fact put to j inconvenience by the Persian authorities owing to their description as British Protected Persons, and oncy request that Mr. Hoare should be asked for his views upon this point. (Express letter from G. of I. dated 11th February - P.Z.1039/33). The C.O. appear to be right in saying in their letter to the F.O. of 7th December (P.Z.7520/32) that it is only in the case of territories in which there is a nationality Wiilra in force or in which tnere is a local ruler possessing authority over the whole of uhe I area concerned that a person belong.ng to one of these : territories could properly be described as a national, citizen or subject of^he territory In any case the descendants bom abroad of natives of British Protected States could not, it appears, be 1—J 3 3 properly described as subjects of these States m the absence of a nationality law in the State concerned, although they would for one generation continue to be British Protected Persons. No doubt most Indian States/ 1212 5000 0/32States have rulers who possess authority over the wnol of the State^ ani nationality legislation has recently been enacted in the Kurram, Hyderabad and Kashmir, as a result of which descendants born abroad of natives of these States retain the nationality of their parents for two generations. It certainly does not j seem worth while, however, to secure the adoption of nationality laws in other Indian States unless these can be shown to be really necessary, 'Kurrami nationality' is itself somewhat of se absurdity and there are other tribal tracts in India for which i nationality legislation could not be contemplated. We might therefore inform the F.O. that we are reluctant to adopt formulae similar to those adopted for describing Kurramis, etc. in the case of other British Protected Persons of Indian origin, unless it can be established by further reference to Mr. Ho are that such action is really required. I - is also suggested that we may confirm the assumption in the F.O. letter of 21st Feb. (P.Z. 1046/35 below) that in the case of Kurrsmis, etc&gt; we do not nesire what instructions regarding the new formulae of description should be issued to all Consular Officers seeing that these formulae have been sanctioned primarily for use in the passports of persons travelling to and residing in Persia. The F.O. have already informed Consular Officers xTi r sia, Iraq and Syria of the new arrangements and tnis appears to be all that is necessary.

Sir John Simon assumes that it is not desired by the Secretary of State for India that instructions should be issued to all His Majesty's Consular Officers to employ the formulae shown in paragraph 1 of the circular when issuing passports to natives of the territories in question, these foriimlae having been sanctioned primarily for use in the passports of persons travelling to and residing in Persia* Mr. Koare has sent copies of the circular to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty's Consul at Basra, and a copy is now being sent to His Majesty's Consul-General at Beirut. These officers will no doubt be guided by the circular in cases where they issue passports to Kurramis, Kashmiris, and Hyderabadis, (whether the passports are required for travelling to Persia or elsewhere). The number of such persons in foreign countries other than those covered by the districts of the above-mentioned officers is liKely to be very small. Moreover/ Under-Secretary of State India Office 0Moreover, should a passport containing the old description he issued at any other post for the purpose of travelling to Persia, the recipient on arrival in Persia could appeal to the nearest British Consul for assistance if difficulties were raised by the local authorities. 3, Copies of this letter and of the enclosure are being sent to the Colonial Office.

T is to be discontinued. 2 . I am to request therefore that in future, when issuing or renewing the passports or Nationality Certificates of nationals of the above-mentioned territory or States, you will act in conformity with these arrangements. 3.

One of the conditions on which release from Persian nationality is granted to persons who failed to opt within the time limit prescribed in the Persian laws, 1930, is that persons concerned shall give an undertaking that within one year from the date of relinquishing their Persian nationality they will transfer to Persian subjects the rights in respect of immovable property which they possess in Persia or which they may in future obtain by inheri tance even if Persian laws permit their possession by foreign subjects.

His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, telegraphs that Press notice can now be published. It will be published here on Thursday, November 3rd. I ailA ' I, 115 (231) Press Communique, dated the 3rd November 1932. It is notified for publio infbrmatiofi that a new “ Persian Nationality Law” was passed by the Persian Majlis in Septeicber 1929. According to Article I of the Law, the following persons inter alia are regarded as Persian subjects:—• (а) All residents of Persia with the exception of those whose foreign notion#lity is establishment, ( б ) Those born in Persia of foreign parents one of whom was born in Persia, (c) Those born in Persia whose furthers are foreign subjects, bat who at the time of reaching the age of 18 are residing in Persia. 2. Articles II and III of the Law allow the persons following under (b) and (c) to divest themselves of Persian nationality and to adopt the nationa lity of their fathers within one year after attaining the age of 18, subject to the fulfilment of two conditions, namely, first that their fathers’ Gevernment recognizes them as their own subjects, and secondly that the law in the territories of their fathers’ Government allows the children born of Persian subjects to resume Persian nationality without special permission of the State concerned. 3. An Act supplementary to the 1929 Law was passed on the 2lst October 1930 and Article 1 thereof allowed persons coming under ( 6 ) and (c) and who were over the age of 18 at the time of the enforcement of the 1929 Law to exercise the privilege of divesting themselves of Persian nationality provided under Article II of the 1929 Law, within one year from the date of passing of the Supplementary Act. In Article 2 of this Act it was explain ed that in order that persons coming under (c) might be regarded as Persian subjects they should have resided in Persia at least one more yearimmediate* ly_after attaining the age of 18. In this connection it should be borne in mmd that where the mother is Persian, a child born in Persia is considered to 4 h ? ^jec^nder ( 6 ) of Article 1 of the Lavv of 1929, even though the child did not reside in Persia betweeni his 18th and 19th birthdays. 4.

(In such case certified copies of documents must be attached.) In support of my rights to British nationality under British Law I attach the annexed certificate issued by (232) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign' Office, No. 444, dated the 22nd October 1932. 1 have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 150 of the 3rd October last (S. No. 228), on the subject of the procedure to be followed for the renunciation of Persian nationality by those British subjects who had failed to take the necessary steps to that end within the period prescribed by the Supplementary Articles 1 and 2 (passed on the 21st October 1930) of the Persian Nationality Law. 2 . Subsequent to the date of my despatch No. 395 of the 13th September last (S. No. 225), the Passport and Nationality section of the Ministry for Foreign Affiairs intimated that, contrary to the arrangement previously'made, it would be necessary for those persons who had failed to take advantage in proper time of the facilities afforded them by the Supplementary Article 1 of the Law of 21st October 1930, to petition the Persian Government for release from Persian nationality in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII ot the parent law of 7th September 1929. 3. It has therefore been arranged that the following procedure shall be followed by British subjects affected, viz :— I he applicant shall address a petition to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the form attached (Annex. A). This petition should be accompanied by a Certificate of his recognition as a British subject in the form attached (Annex. B). issued abroad by a British Consular Officer, and in the United Kingdom or other British territory by the competent authority. 4. The applicant will then deliver his petition—- (а) in Persia to the Police of his district, ( б ) abroad to the nearest Persian Consular or diplomatic official, for transmission to the proper quarter. 5. In accordance with paragraph 3 of Article XIII, the applicant will be required by the Police or the Persian Consulate concerned to give the necessary undertaking in writing as regards the disposal of his immoveable property in Persia. 6 . I have to explain that the wording of the Certificate of Nationality (Annex. B) is explained by the fact that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was insistent that the certificate should contain an assurance to the effect that the Persian subject, after losing his Per-iaii nationality, should “ acquire ” British nationality. 7. I trust that no objection will be raised to the form decided upon, which seems to be quite innocuous. 'Corresponding to para. 1 (6) or 1 (c) of the Communique.8 . In view of the concluding clauses of paragraph 3 of the Article XIII of the Law, it would appear necessary for the applicant’s petition to make special mention of his wife and children should he desire that the permission to relinquish Persian nationality be extended to them. 9. I have sent copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 218), His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine (No. 101-M.), His Majesty’s Minister at Baghdad (No. 113), His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beyrout (No. 100-M.), His Majesty’s Consul at Basra (No. 99-M.) and His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Pers r a (Circular No. 38).

As a result the large number of Kurramis resident in northern Persia have become involved in difficulties with the local authorities (particularly at Asterabad, Amul and Resht) when applying for residence permits under the Law governing the Residence of Foreigners in Persia, a copy of which was transmitted to yoar predecessor in Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 260 of 30th May 2931 [Enclo. I in Serial No. (2) in F. No. 374-N/31]. The authorities confiscated their notionality papers and tried to make them take out sijill-i-ahwal as Persian subjects. The representations which I consequently made on their behalf were embodied in two notes to which the enclosed conciliatory communication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a reply, the question having first formed the subject of discussions between the official in charge of the Nationality and Passport Section of the Ministry and a member of my staff. 5. In view of the recent promulgation of Nationality Laws in the Kurram, Faskmir and Hyderabad (Deccan) it appears to me that in order to meet the difficulties raised by the Persian Government there should in principle be no objection to giving the natives of these territories some such designation as those I propose below, which are all by inference permissible under the terms of these Nationality Laws. The following are my suggestions :— For Kurrams : National of the British Indian Agency Territory of the Kurram, or National of the British Protected Territory of the Knrram. I would mention that the Persian Government would have no objection to the use of the word “ Protected ” when it relates to a State or Terrirory and not to an individual. For Kashmiris : Subject of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. For ffyderabadis :— National of the Indian State of Hyderabad (Deccan). I have used the term “ subject ” or “ national ” according as one term or the other is used in the Nationality law of the State concerned. 6 . I should be interested to receive in this connexion, for my personal guidance, an explanation of the exact constitutional status of the territory of the Kurram, which is presumably “ tribal ” or‘‘ agency ” territory, thoush coloured red (the colour of British India) in, for instance, the map in the India Office List. I should in particular be glad to know whether it should be regarded as an Indian State (Section B II of the Annexure to Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions) or as pro tected territory in a position somewhat similar to that of the Trucial Chiefs [Section D ( 6 ) of the same Annex.]: whether in fact it is under the Suzer ainty or Protection of the King. In a sense it appears not to be a state at all, as are Swat or Chitral, and the Turi jirga may not be the sole tribal authority throughout the territory. 7. As the majority of British Protected Persons affected in Persia come from the afore-mentioned territories, I should be glad if the consent in prin ciple of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India to some new designation on these lines could be communicated to me as early as possible by telegram. This will enable me to gh 7 e the necessary instructions to Consular Officers in Persia to call in and effect the necessary alterations in the passports of those nationals concerned resident within their Consular districts and enable the officers to issue the certificates of nationality requned for renunciations of Persian nationality [see my telegram ISo. 125 of Septem ber 6 th 1932, Serial No, (218)]. The latter is a fairly urgent question. 8 . As regards the remaining categories of {&lt; British Protected Pei sons , as show'n in the Annex, to Chapter XXII of the General ^ Instructions to Consular Officers, who are not resident in great numbers in Persia 1 am addressing you separately.121 9 . I am sending copies of ibis despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 17o), the Honourable the Political Resident in the Peisian Gulf at Bushire (No. 136) and a copy will be sent to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht when the Vice-Consulate re-opens. (No. 23 .) Enclosure. Translation of a note from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Passport and Nationality Section) addressed to His Majesty'’s Minister, No. 170051 210130211, dated Murdad 31st, 1311 (August 22nd, 1932). While acknowledging the receipt of Your Excellency’s notes of Khordad 3lst (June 21st, 1932) Nos. 288 and 289 and Murdad 13th (August 4th, 1932) No. 357, I have the honour to inform you that the competent quarters of my Government have given careful consideration to the contents of the notes in question and admit that the question of the national status of the Kurramis who have been settled down in Persian territory should be cleared up as soon as possible. Your Excellency has suggested that the documents which are now in the hands of the Kurramis whereby they introduce themselves as British Protected Persons should be considered as valid. The competent quarters of my Government however cannot from the point of view of legal grounds of the Imperial Government agree with this view and consider such documents valid. Your Excellency is, no doubt, aware that the inhabitants of a country are not considered as subjects of that country when the foreign nationality of these persons is established and that a foreign power consider them as their indisputable subjects. In the identity papers which are seen in the hands of certains Kurramis resident in Persia, the national status of these persons is not clear .and the fact that the nationality of these persons has not been mentioned in the identity papers issued to them will naturally cause difficulty to the competent quarters of my Government from the legal point of view in respect of recognising their foreign nationality. In these ciicumstances, the only solution of the case which occurs tome consists of the fact that the words Sk British Protected Persons ” should be ciossed out from their papers and that the British nationality of these per* sons, ^namely that category of persons who are not coming under sections 4 f , 11 . f °f. 1 °f the Nationality Law should be mentioned clearly ia the identity papers which have been issued to them. la case from the point of view of organisation of His Britannic Majesty's Government there would beany obstacles in the way of abiding by such a procedure the Kurrami nationality of those persons who are born outside Persia and from non-Persian fathers should at least be mentioned with an annotation to the effect that ivurram is one of the parts of India. As you see, the utmost assistance has been extended in respect of Your Excellency s request and 1 am looking forward to receiving at an early date your favourable reply in the matter so that an end may be put to it in a In conclusion, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the competent quarters of my Government have never made forcibly anybody to become Persian subjec and that in case these persons, whole foreign ffl n ,f • l 7 f l ted . in the documents issued are experienc ing certain difficulties in respect of obtaining permits of residence, such difficulty arises from the obscure situation of their nationality, and, with L view to avoid ing such difficulties I hope that you would expedite the issue of a replv to the present communication so that the national status of these persons Lay be cleared up as soon as possible and that the documents which have bin hand ed by some of these people to the competent quarters at the tile‘of the.r submitting declaration for obtaining permits of residence may bf fo/warded to Your Excellency for completion (correction). ay b torwarKill re-on .petent e y suoui (I Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 373, dated the 6th September 1932. In my despatch No. 372 of today’s date (Serial No. 241) I have had the honour to recommend certain changes in the way in which natives of the v - : Kurram and of Kashmir and Hyderabad (Deccan) are described in their ^ passports or certificates of nationality. My recommendations arise from the fact that the Persian Government object to the use of the phrase “ British Protected Persons ” and their tenour is that the use of this phrase should be avoided. 2. The objections of the Persi n Government are based officially, as I have explained in my first despatch, upon the fact that by Article 1 of their Nationality Law anyone in Persia is a Persian subject unless he can be shown to be a national of some state other than Persia. The phrase “ British Protected Person ” does not, in their opinion, denote any particular nationality while the phrase “ native ” equally fails to convey the sense of petent p E legal gw er suelife ints of a i foreign nafa consider tk ih are seen it il status ole ,e persons k 1 natural i ions ” si tioned cp! fanni# riding l| iK are to ntioned ^ lia. respect at an es prit' k ^ rcibly \ are 3, SUC. aw f a reply jersous r 1 aveto time ot “subject” or “ citizen 3. The constitutional. reasons which necessitate the use of the term “British Protected Person”, in addition to the term “ British subject ” have been explained in detail to the officials dealing with this question at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. They do not deny that a territory or state may be under the protection of another state and they do not object to the use of the term “ Protected ” i i connexion with any given territory. They nevertheless maintain their objection to the use of the term ^ British Protected Person ”. 4. I should explain at this point that the official objections of the Persian Government are reinforced by others of an unofficial, and to them pro! ably much more cogent, character. The officials at -the Ministry have^ frankly explained that they dislike the term “ British Protected Person most of all because it is reminiscent of the days in which foreign Governments used to extend their protection to persons who were by birth and residence Persian subjects. It is this familiar argument of “ amour-propre ^ which will, fear, prove the real obstacle to the acceptance by the Persian Government of any form of words including the phrase “ Protected Person . 5. The so’ntion that the Persian officials themselves have suggested unofficially is that British Protected Persons should ^ be called simply “ Nationals of the Kurram ” or whatever their territory might be. 6 I have suggested in my first despatch that a suitable variation of this phrase should be adopted in *the case of Kurramis and of two of the Indian States and I now venture to enquire how far it will be possible to make this suggestion one of general application, at any rate m cases w er nationality papers are issued in Persia or for the express purpose of travelling to Persia. 7. The forms which I suggest might be considered for the various territories enumerated in the Annex, to Chapter XXII of the General In- structions to Consular Officers (June 1930) are as follows . (a) « National of the British Protectorate of .... ” or, in cases where V “Protectorate” is an integral part of the name National of Protectorate”, without the use of the vord “ British” “ Subject of the British Protectorate of Zanzibar”. (b) i. “Subject of the British Protected (Malay) State of • “ National of the British Protected State of Brunei (ISorth Borneo) ( ? Tonga) ”. ii. “ Subject of the Indian State ofi • / 123 (c) “ National of the British Mandated Territory of “ Palestinian Citizen (d) “ National of the Sudan (Hadramaut) Subject of the Sultan (Sheikh, Ruler) of ” 8 . In some oases where the words 44 British ” or “ Indian ” do not coibq ' naturally into the description the words 44 Under British Protection ” migtt be added. But e^en if these words are omitted the description will be written either on a British passport, or on a nationality oeitificate headed 44 Certificate of British nationality ” and bearing the Royal coat of arms, This should generally be sufficient to indicate the British protection of the bearer. 9. The preceding paragraph does not of course hold true of the nationals of those Arab States in the Persian Gulf that use their own passports, but equally the whole of the present discussion is irrelevant in such cases. ’ I do not know whether it would be correct to state that the position of such per. sons in regard to British diplomatic and consular officers in Persia is analo gous to that of Greek citizens, whose interests are at present entrusted to Bis Majesty’s Government, but it would probably be necessary to use some argument if the point were raised by the Persian Government on technical grounds, and not on political grounds as hitherto. 10 . I am well aware that it is at fi st sight absurd that His Majesty’s Government should be asked to modify a system in force throughout tbe Empire in order to meet the susceptibilities of a country like Persia. lam also aware that it has been found preferable in the past to avoid any precise description of the national status of the natives of certain protected territo ries. My excuse xor putting forward these recommendations in the face of such considerations is paitly that the objections of the Persian Government are far from being illogical and that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs which was probably not responsible for the absurdities of the nationality law, appears anxious to find practical solutions of the difficulties created by it, u mam y iat n nothing is done to meet their view, innocent Protected + V1 00ntmu + ? s ^® r ever y form of inconvenience.

Sir, I am directed by Lord Passfield to acknowledge the receipt of your letter - T 7115/9/378 - of the 14th of July last regarding the scope of the definition of British Protected Persons in paragraph 10 (b) of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, and asking for observations as to the various categories of persons regarded as included in the term and the procedure which might be adopted in dealing with applications to be accorded British protection abroad. 2. As Mr. Secretary Henderson is aware, this question - v/hat persons should be accorded British protection abroad - can only be decided with due regard to tne law or practice in the Protectorate or Protected State concerned. At the present time, v/i th the sole exception of Zanzibar, no British Protectorate or Protected State has adopted legislation defining v/hat persons are nationals of the teiri torie.j. 3 . A copy of the Zanzibar Decree of 13tn November, 1911 - Chapter 27 Revised Edition of Lav/s v/hich deals v/i th the matter, is enclosed. I am to refer also to the letter from this Department of tne 22nd August ( 70077/30) in which was enclosed the draft 1 m 1 ! 18 i h 'HE UNDER SECRETARY OE STATE, FOREIGN OEBICE.&amp;raft of a nafionalify Glaus© which, has loesn propossd for inclusion in legislation at present under consideration for North Borneo. in these cases 1 nationals* , or ^ub^eets*, as described in the laws wil1 ex hypothesi he British protected persons in other countries. 4. In Lord Passfield r s opinion it is not desirable that nationality legislation should be passed in or for any protected territory in which there is no local Ruler possessing authority over the whole of the territory. Nationality involves the recognition of a person as a subject or citizen of some Sovereign or State, and while it is reasonable and proper that there should be, e.g. Zanzibari or Tongan nationality for the subjects of the Sultan of Zanzibar or the Queen of long a respectively, it would not be expedient to create or recognise a Nyasaland or Northern Rhodesia nationality or a nationality for the subjects of comparatively small Native Kingdoms within a British Protectorate such as those in Uganda or Nigeria. 5. On the other hand, where a local Ruler possesses de jure sovereignty over the whole of a protected territory, even though such sovereignty may de facto be exercised or controlled by British authority. Lord Passfield is advised that there is m legal principle sound reason for holding that the subjects of such Ruler have a nationality* ibe legislation providing for naturalization in certain protected states in Malaya and in Tonga is in itselfan implication that there is a nationality which can be acquired under that legislation. It would there fore appear proper that nationality legislation should be adopted in the Far Eastern Protected States and also in Tonga; but the Secretary of State would deprecate such action in ordinary Protectorates such as those referred to at the end of the last foregoing paragraph. 6 . Ee considers, however, that such legislation in Protected States should not extend nationality to more generations born abroad than it has been the general policy to have recognised as British protected persons; and following the provisions of the Zanzibar Decree he would propose that the provision should be limited in the case of persons born abroad to the first generation born of a father v/ho was himself born in the territory concerned (or was naturalised there). 7. As regards the British Protectorates in which it is considered inexpedient to legislate on the subject of nationality, Lord Passfield thinks that the matter might be dealt with by a general Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, containing a schedule of the Protectorates to which it applies and defining the persons who are to be regarded as British Protected persons. 8 . Lord Passfield would be glad to receive Mr. Henderson's observations on these proposals before taking steps to propose legislation on the subject of nationality. He sees no reason, however. whywhy British Consuls should not he informed in the meantime, if Mr. Henderson considers it desirable, that British protection should be extended to children born abroad whose fathers were born or naturalized in a British Protectorate or Protected State.

K.}^9 D -ci^ ,y^\ * X I It la notified for public information that a new £^ oV -I Persian nationality Law' 5 was passed by the Persian Majlis in September 1929. According to Article I of the Law, the i allowing persons in ter a-lia are regarded as Persian subjects » ‘^aj A-nl residents oi Persia witn the exception of those wnose 1oreign nationalicy is established, (t) Those born in Persia of foreign parents one of whom was born in Persia, (c) Those born in Persia whose fathers are foreign subjects, but who at the time of reaching the age of 18 are residing in Persia. 2. Articles II and III of the Law allow the persons falling under (b) and (c) to divest themselves of Persian nationality and to adopt the nationality of their fathers wi thin one year after attaining the ago of 18, subject to tin fulfilment of two conditions, namely, first, that their « fathers ? Government recognizes them as their own subject secondly that the law in the territories of their fathers’ Government allows the children born of Persian subjects to resume Persian nationality without special permission of the State concerned. 3. An Act supplementary to the 1929 Law was passed on the 21st October 1930 and Article 1 thereof allowed persons coming under (b- and (e) and who were over the age of 18 at the time of the enforcement of the 1929 Law to exercise the privilege of divesting themselves oi Persian nationality provided under Article II of the 1929 Lav/, within one year from the date of passing of the Supplementary Act, In Article 2 of this Act it was explained that in order that persons coming under (c) might be regarded as Persian subjects r nd Ab-TARY’S 158 . theyf^TD pie they should ha^e resided in Persia at least one more year immediately after' attaining the age cf 18. In this connectior j| shllpld be borne in mind? that i/tierji ! 1 Mother is Persian, a child born in Persia is considered to be a Persian subject under (b) of Article 1 of the Law of 1929, even though th( child did nut reside in Persia between his 18th and 19th birthdays, 4 , it is how understood that the Persian Q-overument will be prepared to entertain sympatneticaj-ly for a short neriod applications from persons of British nationalii.v wiio had passed the age oi 18 belore the Law of September Hth 1929 entered into force and who omitted to exercise right of option before 21st October 1931. One of the conditions on which release from Persian nationality is granted to persons wbe failed to opt within the time limit prescribed, in the Persian Law oi -.930 is that persons concerned shall give an undertaking that within one year from the date of relinquishing their Persian nationality they will transfer to Persian subjects the rights in respect of immovable property which they possess ln Persia or which they may in future obtain by inheritance, even if Persian Laws permit their possession ry foreign subjects. fhe release from Persian nationality of a married mar/does not include his wife and children unless authority given by Persian Council of Ministers expie.oU - - 5, Applications from those who desire to aval f ! a co ssi on should be themselves of the Persian lovernment s con,.ess, ns are sed to the Imperial Persian Ministry of foreign I'o nna ± f y a.ndi o o ou a ■ snowing form as though the period of grace Affairs in the loliowing prescribed in Supplement to Article 1 had not expir.d.^ 6 .

[inute Paper. Political Department. ) i) The papers now submitted on this file raise two closely related aspects of the question of the national status of British Protected Persons in Persia (l) How should these persons be described in their documents of nationality? This point is dealt with at P.Z.5924/32 which was in course of submission when the Government of India’s telegram of 11th November arrived. H.M. Minister, Tehran, has suggested that British Protected Persons in Persia should be described as 'nationals u or 'subjects” of their respective states or territories in view of the Persian objection to the use of the term 'British Protected Person'. (2) What is the national status of the descendants born in Persia of Kurramis and other British protected persons, and can they divest themselves of Persian nationality in accordance with Art.II of the Persian nationality law? y^It will be necessary to answer these questions in order to decide on the f orm of nationality certificate to be used for descendants of British Protected Persons who wish to divest themselves of Persian nationality. In order to be able to take advantage of Art. II of the Persian Law, the applicant must have a certificate from the father's government to the effect that that government will recognise him as its own subject, and also the reciprocal right of children born of Persian , subjects to claim Persian nationality must be recognised in the state or territory of the applicant. In the case of inhabitants of the Kurram, Hyderabad and Kashmir, which have recently promulgated nationality laws, both these conditions will be fulfilled and/ vi 1212 5G00 9.32and fortunately these are the people with whom we are principally concerned. Subject to the views of the Grovernment of India there seems to be no objection to describing them as ’’subjects” or ’’nationals 1 ’ of their states instead of ”B.P. persons”. It appears, however, that persons originating from states or territories without nationality laws will P.2252/30 P.4533/30 at present be unable to divest themselves of Persian nationality, since they will be unable to prove an alternative nationality. The question whether the status of a British Protected person should descend to children born abroad has never been definitely decided, but in any case the Persians will not admit that an individual’s national status is sufficiently described by the term. Nevertheless, it is suggested that all cases where descendants of British Protected persons originating from India make application to be relieved &lt;t&gt;f Persian nationality should be brought to the notice of ?. 8700/30 P.Z.1130/31 P.Z. 3262/31 the Government of India, in order that they may arrange iS li ■ if necessary for legislation in the state or territory from which the persons concerned originated. Possibly all that would be necessary would be a declaration by the authority in the state or territory of the individual applicant to the effect that they recognised him as a subject and that a Persian in a similar position would be allowed by them to retain his Persian nationality. Mr.Hoare’s despatch imo. 444, of October 22nd enclosed a revised form of application and of nationalit' certificate for use by British subjects applying to be divested of Persian nationality, and the Government of India now ask what iorm of nationality certificate sSioulld be/ I do not thii -this ought t necessaryi j.cjy. 10 . 11 . ’.Z.690 2 / 32,% linute PB»p© r « be used in the ease of British Protected Persons. The form of the certificate will depend on whether Mr.Hoare’s suggestions for describing Kurramis etc. are adopted (see previous minute on P.Z.5924/32). Subject to the Government of Indian concurrence, there seems to be no objection to Mr.Hoare’s suggestions and we may leave the details of the certificate to be decided by the Government of India in consultation with him. A draft telegram to the Government of India on these lines is submitted* Thig/telegram would require Foreign Office concurrence. It would of course supersede the draft on P.2.5924/32* G.E.

Under the Persian Nationality Law of Septem ber 7, 1929 (which entered into force four days later), all persons (1) who were born in Persia of parents one of whom was born in Persia; or (2) who were born in Persia and on reaching the age of 18 are residing in Persia and continue to reside there not less than one year after attaining that age, are Persian subjects; but these persons have the right within one year after reaching the age of 18 “ to adopt the nationality of their father ” (and thereby divest themselves of Persian nationality) “ on condition that during the above period they submit a written declara tion to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to which shall be annexed a certificate from their father’s Government ^to the effect that that Government will recognize them as its own subjects.” , _ t A supplementary law was passed on Octo ber 21, 1930, providing that persons in the above mentioned categories who had passed the age of 18 when the law of September 7, 1929, entered into force could opt for their father’s nationality within one year from the passing of the sup plementary law— i.e., before October 21, 1931. It is understood, however, that the Persian Government will be prepared to entertain sympathetically for a short period applications from persons of British nationality who had passed the age of 18 before the law of September, 1929, entered into force and omitted to exercise the right of option before October 21, 1931 Any British subjects in Europe who are affected by the above-mentioned provisions ot the Persian law and now wish to obtain release from Persian nationality should communicate with the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, Downing Street, S.W.l.£.Z.5924/32. Political Department. According to Art. I of th.e Persian Nationality law of 1929 :T all residents of Persia 11 whose foreign nationality is established. The foreign nationality ol a person is considered as estaolished when his documents of nationality are not objected to by the Persian Government. rT The Persian Government has objected to the use of the words rT British protected person, native of u in documents issued by the passport authorities in India and elsewhere - officially on the ground that the national status of the persons so described is insufficiently defined, but also because the phrase reminds them of the days when foreign Governments used to extend their protection to Persian subjects. As a result a large number of Kurramis resident in Persia have got into difficulties with the local authorities who have eonfiscd;ed their nationality papers and tried to male them tale out Sijill-i-ahwal . Apart from Kurramis the persons most affected at present are natives of Kashmir and Hyderabad, but the objections raised by the Persians would apply to any British protected person in Persia. absurdity of altering a system of classification of British subjects which is in use throughout the empire in order to meet Persian susceptibilities and of the objections to describing too precisely the national status of natives of certain protected territories, but on the other hand the Persian Ministry are deemed Persian subjects !r with the exception of those ofX* of Foreign Affairs, which was probably not responsible for the nationality law, seems anxious to find a practical solution of difficulties created by it, and it is important, if possible, to save innocent British protected persons from persecution. Mr. Hoare has therefore suggested in his two despatches of 6 th September that British Protected persons should be described as 'subjects” or 'nationals of the British Protectorate, Indian State etc. to which they belong, at any rate in cases where nationality papers are issued in Persia or for the express purpose of travelling to Persia. (The Persians are quite willing to recognise, apparently, that one State may be under the protection of another.) In the case of the three territories primarily involved (i.e. the Kurram, Kashmir and Hyderabad) the procedure suggested seems comparatively unobjectionable, and it will perhaps be necessary to apply it in the case of all British protected persons resident in,or visiting, Persia. To give it any wider application in the interests of uniformity would hardly seem to be worth the trouble involved. The Foreign Office have asked us what reply should be returned to Mr. Hoare T s despatches, and a draft express letter is submitted asking the Government of India for their views upon his suggestions with reference to India and the Arab states in the Persian Gulf. ^ 4^ Since in the case of natives of^Kurram, Hyderabad and Kashmire the question is of some urgency,it is proposed to ask the Government of India to telegraph whether they agree with the Ministers suggestions as regards natives of theseterritories, i sflqP.Z.5924/32. raft Paper. — political Department, EXPRESS LETTER ^ ATR^ tt..

I should he interested to receive in this connexion, for my peconal guidance, an explanation of the exact of the territory of the Kurram, which is presumably tribal or 'agency' ■i 7 w agency” territory, though coloured red (the colour of British india) in, for instance, the map in the India Office list# I should in particular he glad to know whether it should he regarded as an Indian State (Section B II of the toner to Chapter oil of the Consular Instructions) or as protected territory in a position somewhat similar to that of the Trucial Chiefs (Section V ( 6 ) of the same Annex) j whether in fact it is under the Suzer ainty ®r Protection of the King* In a sense it appears not to he a state at all, as are Swat or Chitral, and the Turi jirga may not he the sole tribal authority throughout the territory# % As the majority of British Protected Persons affected in Persia come from the afore-mentioned territories, I should he glad if the consent in principle of His Majesty’s Gorernment and oi the ioTernment of India to some new designation on these lines could he communicated to me as early as possible hy telegram# This will enable me to give the necessary instructions to Consular Officers in Persia to call in and effect the necessary alterations in the passports of those nationals concerned resident within their Consular districts and enable the officers to issue the certificates of nationality required for renunciations of Persian nationality (see my telegram Ho. 125 of September 6 th 1932)# The latter is a fairly urgent question# As regards the remaining categories of ^British Protected Persons*, as shown in the Annex to Chapter XXII of the General Instructions to Consular Officers, who are not resident in great numberg in Persia I am addressing you separately# I m sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary the Government of India (Ho# 17^), the Honourable the ■ olitical Resident(copy). jn^KSLATION* From the Persian Minister for Foreign Affaire (Passport and Nationality Section) addressed to His Majesty’s Monsieur le Mini stre* While acknowledging the receipt of Your Excellency’s notes of Khordad 31st (June 21st 1932) No* 288 and 289 and Murdad 13th (August 4th 1932) No* 357, I have the honour to inform you that the competent quarters of my Government have given careful consideration to the contents of the notes in question and admit that the question of the national status of the Kurramis who have 'been settled down In Persian territory should he cleared up as soon as possible* now in the hands of the Kurramis whereby they introduce themselves at British Protected Persons should be considered as valid* The competent quarters of my Government however cannot from the point, of view of legal grounds of the Imperial Government agree with this view Your Excellency is, no doubt, aware that the inhabitants of a country are not considered as subjects ox that country when the foreign nationality of these persons is established and that a foreign power consider them as their indisputable subjects* In the identity papers which are seen in the hands of certain •• urramic •. v,o-*.denu in Persia, the national status of these persons is not clear and tlSM fte#! that the nationality of these persons has not been mx* mentioned in the identity papers issued to them will naturally cause difflcul y She competent quarters of my Government from the legal point in respect ©f recognising their foreign nationality. In these circumstances, the only solution of the case which occurs to me consists of the fact that the words ”British Protected Persons' should be crossed out from their papers and that the British nationality of these persons, namely that category of pe s oon^ who aot coming under sections 4 and 5 of Article 1 of the Nationality Law r / Minister* Bated Murdad 51st 1311 (August 22nd* j , NO* 17005/210130211* H 1 O A Your Excellency has suggested that the documents which are and consider such documents valid. shouldshould 'bo cX@&amp;3PXy in. fcti© idisii'fc'i'fcy pgtp©!*® wtiicli .- ^ been isf ued to them. In ease from the point of Tlew of organisation of His Britannic Majesty's Government there would he any obstacles in the way of abiding by such a procedure, the Kurrsai nationality of those persons who are born outside Persia and from non-Persian fathers should at least be mentioned with an annotation to the effect that Ku 2 *i*a® is one of* the parts of* India* As you see, the utmost assistance has “been extended in respect of Your Bxeell®ney , s request and I am looking forward to receiving at an early date your favour able reply in the matter so that an end may he put to it in a proper manner* In conclusion, 1 have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the competent quarters of my Government have never made forcibly anybody to become Persian subject and that in case these persons, whose foreign nationality has not been clearly stated in the documents issued are experiencing certain difficulties in respect of obtaining permits of residence, such difficulty arises from the obscure situation of their nationality, and, with a view to avoiding such difficulties I hope that you would expedite the issue of a reply to the present communication so that the national status of these persons may be cleared up as soon as possible and that the documents which have been handed by some of these people to the competent quarters at the time of their submitting declar ation for obtaining permits of residence may be forwarded to Your Excellency for completion (correction)* I avail myself of this opportunity (Signed) Mohammad All Feroughi*3 k' ) British. Legation^ UZh. Gulhek, September 6 th. 19SS. SiTt In my despatch Ho# STS of today’s Sate I have had the honour to recommend certain changes in the way in which natives of the Kurraa and of Kashmir and Hyderabad (Deccan) are described in their passports or certificates of nationality# My recommend ations arise from the fact that the Persian Government object to the use of the phrase 'British Protected Persons' and their tenour is that the use of this phrase should be avoided# S« The objections of the Persian Government are based officially, as I have explained in my first despatch, upon the fact that by Article 1 of their Nationality Daw anyone in Persia is a Persian subject unless he can be shown to Be a national of some state other than Persia# The phrase 'British Protected Person' does not, in their opinion, denote any particular nation ality, while the phrase 'native' equally fails to convey the sense of 'subject' or 'eitiscn% 5 # The constitutional reasons which necessitate the use of the ter® 'British Protected Person', in addition to the term 'British Subject' have been explained in detail to the officials dealing with this question at the Ministry for foreign Affairs. They do not deny that a territory or state may be under the protection of another state and they do not object to the use of the term 'Protected' in connexion with any given territory# They nevertheless maintain their objection to the use of the term 'British Protected Person'. 4 # I should &amp;igfet Honourable ^ John Simon, G.C#S.I#, etc ., ©tc#, ete#&gt;, The Foreign Offied*4 * I should explain at this point that the official objections of the Persian Oovernment are reinforced by others of an unofficialf and to them probably much more cogent, character© fhe officials at the Ministry hare frankly explained that they dislike the term 'British Protected Person” most of all because it is reminiscent of the days in which foreign Qorerxments used to extend their protection to persons who were V by birth and residence Persian subjects* It is this familiar argument of H amour-propre' which will, I fear, prove the real obstacle to the acceptance by the Persian Government of any form of words including the phrase 'Protected Person'* 5 . The solution that the Persian officials themselves have suggested unofficially is that British Protected Persons should be called simply 'nationals of the Kurram” or whatever their territory might be© 6 © I have suggested in my first despatch that a suitable variation of this phrase should be adopted in the ease of Kurramis and of two of the Indian States ant I now venture to enquire how far it will be possible to make this suggestion one of general application, at any rate in caaee where nationality papers are issued In Persia or for the express purpose of travelling to Persia© 7, The ferns which I suggest might he considered for the yarious territories enumerated in the Annex to hapter aXI± of the General Instructions to Consular Officers (June 1J30) are as follows t (A) 'Rational of the British Protectorate of.' ® r » ** * a “** » j nart of the name 'National where 'Protectorate is an integral $ of protectorate', without the use of the word 'British' 'Subject of the British Protectorate of Zanzibar'. (B)u: *^0 considerations is partly that the objections of the Persian Gorem^ ment are far from being illogical and that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs which was probably not responsible for the absurdities of the nationality law, appears anxious to find practical solutions of the difficulties created by it, but mainly that if nothing is done to meet their view, innocent Protected Persons will continue to suffer every form of inconvenience, I therefore trust that my suggestions will be considered as sympathetically as possible. H* Should these suggestions require prolonged examination, I have the honour to request that an early, and if necessary, provisional, decision may at any rate be taken In respect of the territory of the Kurram and the States of Kashmir and Hyderabad, with which I have dealt m± in my despatch Ho# IS, In order to avoid possible confusion on a point of detail, I say add that, so far as I am aware, the Persian Government do not maintain that a foreigner can be described as a national of some territory only if a law formally bestowing that status upon him has been passed in the territory concerned. The necessity for legislation only arises when it is necessary to offer reciprocity by providing facilities for the children of Persian subjects bom in foreign territory to renounce the nationality of that territory# IS.

To meet the first class of case, the form of declaration may, we suggest, be modified as follows :— (i) In paragraph 1 for the words beginning with tc The certificate annexed hereto” and ending with “mybirth” substitute the words “asevi denced by my passport No dated • • which I annex hereto.” (ii) In paragraph 2 for the words “ The certifiate annexed hereto and marked C. is the certificate of the said _ ” substitute the same formula as above. The form of certificate requires no modification in this class of case. 5. In regard to class (6) above, we suggest the following modifications : (i) In paragraph 2 of the form of declaration for the words ‘ The said. • • • • • was a British subject by reason of having been born within His Britannic Majesty’s Dominions ” substitute Thu said was a subject of the State, and con sequently a British protected person, by reason of having been born within the State.” MC223FD A enclosure in A FOIi EIGN SfCPo..... 2 AUG 19365 (w) In paragraph 3 of the form of declaration for my nationality as a natural-born British subject substitute “ my nationahty as a natural-born subject of the ^ State and therewith my status as a British protected person.” (e) In the form of certificate for all that follows “ has satisfied me ” substi tute :— “ (i) that he was at birth a natural-born subject of the State under the law of nationahty by virtue of his father having been born within the State and consequently that he possessed at birth the status of a British pro tected person and “ (ii) that the said preserves such nationality and status 6.

The Secretary of State is advised that failure to exercise this right would not cause a British subject to become naturalised in Persia, and that consequently a British subject would not, by reason of the omission to opt, be deemed to have ceased to be a British subject under Section 13 of the British ^Nationality and &gt;- tatus of Aliens Act, 1914. Mr. Henderson therefore proposes, subject to the concurrence of Mr. Secretary Clynes to inform Sir B.

To The POLITICAL AGENT, KURRAM AGENCY, PARACHINAR, Sir, It has been brought to the notice of us, the elders of the Kurram Valley, that owing to certain provisions recently introduced into Persian Law, in order to secure adequate British protection for certain classes of Kurramis in Persia it is necessary for us to clearly define what is the Kurram Customary Law regarding the national status of the descendants of Turi emigrants born abroad and also of descendants of foreigners born in the Kurram. We therefore declare that:— (а) Descendants of Turi emigrants born abroad are considered to be KurramL, nationals for two generations. (б) Descendants born in Kurram of foreign parentage have the right of retain* ing the nationality of their country of origin (and incidentally of re nouncing Kurram nationality 7 ) on attaining the age of 18 years.

RWoirm OflRpp dated 10th Jnlv.It will be seen that the Foreign Office concur in the view that, instead of at tempting at the present time to formulate definite rules, it would be preferable that individual doubtful cases of descendants of British protected persons of Indian origin should be referred to the Government of India as they arise and that any general questions arising in a concrete form in particular countries should always be dealt with specially as and when they arise. While acceptum this view they have however made the suggestion that it might be desirable to adopt the policy of advising Indian States to make nationality laws. The Government of India will no doubt bear this suggestion in mind. I am, however, to say that the Secretary of State is of opinion that it would be premature to take action on these lines at the present stage, as it would be preferable to postpone consideration of such questions until further progress has been made towards the settlement of wider constitutional issues. Enclosure I in Serial No. (154). Letter from the India Office, to the Foreign Office, No. P. Z. 2862/31, DATED THE 3RD JUNE 1931. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of 14th July 1930, T. 7115/9/378 [Enclosure II of Serial No. (39)], transmitting, copy of a despatch No. 45 of 12th June 1930, from His Majesty’s Consul General at Cairo which suggested the question whether and how far the status of British protected p rsons should be regarded as continuing in the descendants born abroad of such persons. Copy of correspondence* with the Government of India on this subject, so far as British protected persons of Indian origin are concerned, has been transmitted to the Foreign Office and a further copy is enclosed herewith for ease pf reference together with copy of a telegram, dated 22nd May [Serial No. (98)], from the Govern ment of India in paragraph 4 of which they intimate that they agree with the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of the India Office letter of 27th March 1931. Mr. Secretary Benn would accordingly suggest that instead of attempting for the present to formulate definite rules it would be preferable that individual doubtful cases of descendants of British protected persons of Indian origin should be referred to the Government of India as they arise, and that any general questions, arising in a concrete form in particular countries, should also be dealt with specially as and when they arise. Enclosure II in Serial No. (154). Letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office, No. 7089/544/378, dated the 10th July 1931. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to refer to your letter P.Z.-2882/31 (Enclosure I), of the 3rd ultimo, relative to the question whether and how far tie status of British protected persons should be regarded as continuing in the descendants born abroad of such persons, and to inform you that he concurs in the view expressed therein that, instead of attempting at the present time to formulate definite rules, it would be preferable that individual doubtful cases of descendants of British protected persons of Indian origin should be referred to the Government of India as they arise, and that any general questions, arising in a concrete form in particular countries, should also be dealt with specially as and when they arise. 2. Mr. Henderson feels, however, that while it is no doubt necessary to adopt this procedure until more suitable arrangements can be made, the proposed pro cedure is somewhat cumbrous. It may, moreover, not be effective in all cases, seeing that in some cases it may be necessary in order to achieve the object in view to show that a given person possesses the nationality of a given Indian State under the law of that State. 3. In the circumstances, I am to suggest for Mr. Secretary Benn s considera- Bon that it might be desirable to adopt the policy of advising the Indian States ffi make nationality laws, and that paragraph 6 of the enclosed letter from the Colonial Office seems to contain a suitable basis of action. Mr. Henderson appie- ^ lates that the numbers of the Indian States and their differe nt character, as we ll ^To the Government of India dated the 20th November 1930 Serial No. (62). telegram from the Government of India, dated the 23rd February 1931 Serial No, (81). To the Government of India, dated the 27th March 1931 Serial No. (39).as other considerations, may make it impossible for action to be taken m all States at once but he hopes that action may be taken m as many cases as possible, and as soon as reasonably possible, since, as Mr. Benn will doubtless agree, a situation under which there are a number of descendants of British protected persons, natives of Indian native States, and their families, resident abroad, and inclined to claim ^ British protection, and where there is no nationality law defining whether they can have a right to this protection or not, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory. 4. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office. Enclosure III in Serial No. (154). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Foreign Office , No. T. 12644/9/378, DATED THE 3RD NOVEMBER 1930. I am directed by Lord Passfield to acknowledge the receipt of your letter T. 7115/9/378 of the 14th of July last [Enclosure II of Serial No. (39)], regarding the scope of the definition of British Protected Persons in paragraph 10 {b} of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, and asking for observations as to the various, categories of persons regarded as included in the term and the procedure which might be adopted in dealing with applications to be accorded British protection abroad. 2. As Mr. Henderson is aware, this question—what persons should be accorded British protection abroad—can only be decided with due regards to the law or practice in the Protectorate or Protected State concerned. At the present time, with the sole exception of Zanzibar, no British Protectorate or Protected State has adopted legislation defining what persons are Nationals of the territories. 3. A copy of the Zanzibar Decree of 13th November 1911—Chapter 27, Revised Edition of Laws—which deals with the matter, is enclosed. I am to refer also to the letter from this Department of the 22nd of August (70077/30) in which was enclosed the draft of a nationality clause which has been proposed for inclusion in legislation at present under consideration for North Borneo. In these cases ‘ nationals or ‘ subjects ’, as described in the laws, will ex-hj'poihesi be British protected persons in other countries. 4. In Lord Passfield T s opinion it is not desirable that nationality legislation should be passed in or for any protected territory in which there is no local Ruler possessing authority over the whole of the territory. Nationality involves the recognition of a person as a subject or citizen of some Sovereign or State ; and while it is reasonable and proper that there should be, e.g., Zanzibari or Tongan nationahty for the subjects of the Sultan of Zanzibar or the Queen of Tonga respectively, it would not be expedient to create or recognise a Nyasaland or Northern Rhodesia nationality or a nationality for the subjects of comparatively small Native king doms within a British Protectorate such as those in Uganda or Nigeria. 5. On the other hand, where a local Euler possesses de jure sovereignty over the whole of a protected territory, even though such sovereignty may de facto be ex ercised or controlled by British authority, Lord Passfield is advised that there is in legal principle sound reason for holding that the subjects of such Ruler have a nationality. The lagislation providing for naturalization in certain protected ^ Ma]a ^ a ar ? ( ^ Tonga is in itself an implication that there is a nationality which can be acquired under that legislation. It would therefore appear proper that nationality legislation should be adopted in the Far Eastern Protected States and also in Tonga ; but the Secretary of State would deprecate such action m ordinary Protectorates such as those referred to at the end of the last foregoing paragraph. 6. He considers however that such legislation in Protected States should not extend nationality to more generations born abroad than it has been the general policy to have recognised as British protected persons ; and following the pro visions of the Zanzibar Decree he would propose that the provision should be limited m the case of persons born abroad to the first generation born of a father who was himself born m the territory concerned (or was naturalised there). 7. As regards the British Protectorates in which it is considered inexpedient to legislate on the subject of nationality, Lord Passifield thinks that the matter might be dealt with by a general Order in Council under the Foreign JurisdictionAct, containing a schedule of the Protectorates to which it applies and defining the persons who are to be regarded as British Protected persons. ° 8. Lord Passfield would be glad to receive Mr. Henderson’s observations on these proposals before taking steps to propose legislation on the subiect of nationality He sees no reasons, however, why British Consuls should not be in formed in the meantime, if Mr. Henderson considers it desirable, that British protection should be extended to children born abroad whose fathers were born or naturalized in a British Protectorate or Protected State.

Dear Chancery, With reference to your despatch No. 515 of the 21st ultimo relative to the forms of statutory declarations and certificates of nationality to be employed in certain special cases arising in connexion with applications from persons who wish to divest themselves of Persian nationality, we should like to draw your attention to the following points where the forms do not tally with what has been sanctioned. In the form of declaration to be made by British subjects who are unable to produce marriage and birth certificates, line 3 of paragraph 1 should rea as evidence by my British passport The word “ British ” was omitted from tiie specimen form which you circulated. In the same document the word “ dominions ” in paragraph ^ 3 should be written with a small “ d ”, as u Dominions ” with a capital D is nowadays taken to mean the self-governing Dominions only. ^In the form of declaration to be made by a British protected person who can nroduce birth and marriage certificates, there is a clerical error m paragraph 1, the third line of which should read “ The certificate annexed hereto ” (not “ certificates ”). Paragraph 2 of this form contains no mention of the pro duction of the father’s birth certificate. In cases where the declarant is able to produce such a certificate, a sub-paragraph should be added as follows. “ The certificate annexed hereto and marked “ C ” is the certificate of birth of the said (f ather ’ s name) etc.”. The word “ British ” should also be inserted before the word “ passport ” wIigig it occurs in tlic ciGcliir &lt;a tioii. Yours ever, Treaty Department.

His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of'the document noted below on the subject of the national status of Hussein Jamedar and his son Ali:— To the Foreign Office, London, No. 606 of 1st November 193L Enclosure m Serial No. (188). Despatch erom H. M.s’ Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 606, dated the 1st November 1931. I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, copies of two des patches from the acting British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah regarding a cer am Hussein Jamadar, a British Protected Person, and his son, Ali, whom the ersian authorities insist on regarding as Persian subjects. 2. The former history of this case is briefly as follows : Hussein Ali was ^ 0 ^ at Mund, in British Baluchistan, in 1870, and migrated to Basra in about -&gt; moving to Mohammerah some years later. The earliest record of^his r ^stratmn at His Majesty’s Vice Consulate in Mohammerah appears to have been 191 ■ was again registered on February 1st, 1918 (No. 16) and he is at presen e possessor of a passport issued at the Vice Consulate. His son, Ali, was Sibiliyat, Basra, in 1909, was included in his father’s registration certificate m and was later granted a British passport (No. 144 of January 24th, 1929) y Majesty’s Vice Consul at Mohammerah. 3. Last April the Mohammerah police took exception to the absence of Persian entry visa on Ali’s passport and instructed him to proceed to asra ave order to obtain a visa from the Persian Consul there. For this purpose t ey g ^ him a Jawaz-i-Khuruj (exit permit) in which he was described as a Brhisli so &gt;je • The Persian Consul at Basra, however, refused a visa and informed His a ' Consul that Ali was considered by the Persian authorities at Mohammeran o Persian Subject: but he gave no evidence in support of this assertion. 4. Ali was detained at Basra for some weeks while His Majesty s Consul^ Officers at Basra and Mohammerah endeavoured to psrsuade the Persian Q and the authorities at Mohammerah that Ali was not a Persian subject, u May 25th, while the case was still under discussion, Hussein Jamadar s port was impounded by the Governor on the ground that he was a Persian The passport was returned, as a result of remonstrances by Mr. Jakms, 29th, but considerable pressure was brought to bear on Hussein Jamedar o ^ was X.'&lt;l/ IALJ-5 KJ 04 .

This pressure was effective because Hussain Jame ^ the owner of extensive agricultural properties in Persia, which he could n ^^ ose( j without Persian nationality, and in August he informed Mr. Jakins that he pr°P ^ to acquiese in the imposition upon him and upon his son of Persian national the same time he enquired, through Mr. Jakins, whether his British na io jftffiS ^ ^ iJitheg iisposile tha “Br Katie two i liliaveswould be affected thereby. In reply Mr. Dodd addressed to Mr. Jakins a despatch, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, to the effect that his British nationality would remain unaffected. 5 At this juncture, Ali contrived to return to Mohammerah. His British passport was confiscated at the frontier, but was subsequently returned to Mr. Jakins. 6. Throughout this period the Persian authorities produced no evidence of Hussein Jamedar’s Persian nationality other than that they were not satisfied as to his British nationality (compare Section 1 of Article 1 of the Persian Nationality Law of September 7th, 1929) [Serial No. (8) in File 52-N./29). Their attitude is examined in greater detail in the first of the two despatches from Mr. Jakins en closed in this despatch. 7 Apart from the argument about Hussein Jamedar’s employment in the governor ate, which may be dismissed without examination, the case of the Persian authorities rests on their unsupported statement that he is a native of Persian Baluchistan. Hussein Jamadar, on the other hand, can produce no evidence of his r,We of birth Mund, though in British, as opposed to Persian Baluchistan, is actually I believe, in the State of Kolat, but he is referred to in the correspondence sometimes as a British subject and sometimes as a British Protected Person. The latter designation appears to be correct, but the principle is the same in both cases. In such a situation it might be expected that the nationality by which a man had been known all his life might be expected to prevail, but the attitude of the Persian aXrities illustrates the dangers inherent in the opening section of the Persian Nationality Law [Serial No. (8) in File 52-N. 29], The case is unfortunately not a Nationality r-aw L \ , cono l us i V e documentary evidence of Hussein K3Er.£3N?!Blt.

Quite recently a certain Ismail Pirzad, a Mekram of Balu chistan about to be repatriated to India by Messrs the Anglo Persian Oil Company Limited, was similarly stated by the local Nazmieh to be a Persian Subject and i was only after witnesses had been produced to attest to his birth in Karachi that the claim was waived. 4 The Persian Authorities are dissembling if by the reference to employment in the local governorate they intend to imply that Hussein Jamadar formerly held a post of confidence or responsibility. He was a personal servant there in the tinw of Abdi is quite illiterate and had nothing to do with the office. His sole claim to distinction in the public service is that he was formerly Jamadar of the natur or night watchmen maintained by the Shaikh before the institution of police. 5. The use of the designation “ British Protected Person ” appears to present difficulty to local Persian Authorities and to rouse their suspicion. I myself spent a long time attempting to explain to Agha Misbah Fatami now Muavm to the Governor-General at Ahwaz who was unable or unwilling to understand the difference between British India and the Native Indian States that led to the differentiation in national status of natives of India. I do not know how seriously the statement that the protection of British Protected Persons cannot extend to Persia is intended. So far, I gather that only in the special case of Bahreims have the Persian Government adopted a definitely uncompromising attitude in this regard. 6. The ^rounds on which Hussein Jamadar’s claim to British Nationality rests were detailed to some extent in my despatch No. 12/749 of July 13. It is unlikely that verification of his birth in Mund can now be obtained. On the other hand 1 am told that he formerly had several cases in the Karguzar identification ot wmen would prove his acceptance by the Persians as British. I have tried to trace the relative papers in this Vice-Consulate, but my acquaintance, and that of the stafl here with the archives of this post is too recent to produce a successful result. 1 will however bring the matter to Dr. Lincoln’s notice on his return. In the mean time I have asked the Acting British Consul, Ahwaz, to institute s search in his archives where there should be some record of one case for over sixteen thousan krans (Krans 16,000) field against a certain Shaikh Amir about five or six years ago and another dating back four or five years and concerning compensation pa by the Sartip Ahwaz for a portion of Hussein’s garden cut off for road-making.

Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 18 of August 19 I have the honour o report that Hussein Jamadar and nine members of his family taken out the oyiH* Ahtcal. Before doing so, Hussein expressed to me his great reluctance to take any step that might prejudice his right to British Nationality or by which he mig t appear to waver in his allegiance. He explained however that he had been m Persia fifty years, that everything he possesed was in this country and that after so considerable a lapse of time he had now no ties with Baluchistan. His son na been born in this part of the world and knew no other home than Mohammer&amp;n. He had been subjected to continual pressure from the Persians notably through a local merchant Saiyid Mohammad Ali Mustafi (who holds the Mohanuuera Ahwaz post contract) and a certain Hussain son of Abdi and had been threatene with the loss of his properties so that in all the circumstances he felt himself loive to yield. I explained to him in the terms of paragraph three of your despatc under retprenee the nosition with regard to his British Nationality.

'With regard to the son, as I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 4 of August 24, Ali has returned to Mohammerah. He did not secure a Persian visa and his British Passport was confiscated on his arrival here. He, too, has taken out a Sijil Ahwal and on it his age is shown as thirty-two years. He will thus escape conscription. According to his British Passport he was actually born in 1909. In accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 11 of August 26, I have requested the Governor of Mohammerah to return the confiscated passport to me. As in the case of the father I propose, subject to your concurrence, to hand the passport back to its holder whom I have already caused to be informed of the purport of paragraph five of your despatch. I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Acting British Consul at Ahwaz and at Basra. Sub-enclosure 3 in Serial No. (188). No. 18. {U. F. S. to Ahwaz.) Sir, British Legation, Gulhek (Tehran), 19th August 1931. With reference to your telegram No. 3 of the 12th instant on the subject of Hussein Jamadar’s nationality, and that of his son Ali, I have to inform you that the position now appears to me in the following light. 2. Hussein is recognised as a British subject by the British authority. The Persian Government on the other hand lays claim to him as a Persian subject on grounds unknown but presumably because his foreign nationality has not been established to their satisfaction, vide Persian Nationality Law, 7th September 1929, Article I, paragraph one [Enclosure to Serial No. (8) in F. 52-N.-29]. 3. This claim of the Persian Government does not cause Hussein to lose his British national Status vis-d-vis of the British Consular Authorities. The cir cumstance that he does not invoke British consular protection within this country is not material. Since he has not lost his British nationality, the question of his reassuming it does not rise. 4. The nationality of the son Ali will depend in the eyes of the Persian Govern ment on that of the father. If the father does not resist the Persian Government s claim respecting himself, it becomes difficult for the son Ali to resist being claimed as a Persian subject in Persia. In order to do so he would have to adduce evidence to prove to the satisfaction of the Persian Government that his father was not a Persian subject. In that case his father would be divested of his Persian nationaii y with consequent effect upon his ownership of landed properties m Persia. 5. To sura up, Hussein Jamadar and his son Ali, even though claimed as Persian subjects by the Persian Government, are and will continue to be recogmsec by the British authority as British subjects, unless further evidence comes to light to prove the contrary.

Despatch feom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 607, DATED THE 1ST NOVEMBER 1931. With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram No. 131 of August lOth [Serial No. (155)], regarding the effect on British nationality of failure on the part of a British Subject to avail himself of the option accorded in the Supplementary Articles of October 21st, 1930 [enclosure to Serial No. (59)], to divest himself of the Persian nationality which he acquired by the Persian Nationality Law of September 7th, 1929 (see page 29 of Command Paper 3907-1931), I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, a copy of a despatch from the acting British Consul at Shiraz making an enquiry as to the effect on British nationality of the acceptance of Persian identity papers (sijill-i-ahwal). 2. I also enclose a copy of my reply, and shall be glad to learn whether its terms receive Your Lordship’s approval. 3. I may add that from what I may term the personal, as distinct from the legal, point of view, I feel strongly that British Subjects who have been placed by Persian legislation in a position in which they have virtually no choice but to accept Persian nationality should not be deprived of their British nationality on that account, even though it may be to their material advantage to possess dual nationality. 4. In this connection I have the honour to invite Your Lordship’s attention to my despatch No. 606 of the 1st November 1931, regarding Hussein Jamedar and his son, Ali [enclosure to Serial No. (188)]. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India. Sub-enclosure 1 to Serial No. (189). Despatch prom His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 39, dated the 8th September 1931. In your circular despatch No. 41 of the 12th August 1931 [not received, but please see Serial No. (155)] you informed Consular Officers that failure on the part of a British subject who by Persian Law has also acquired Persian nationality to avail himself of the option of renouncing his Persian nationality would not cause him to become naturalised in Persia, and would not, therefore, entail the loss of his British nationality under Section 13 of the amended British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914. 2. I beg leave to put a supplementary question, the answer to which would be of great interest to several persons residing in this consular area. If a person hither to enjoying British nationality who finds himself a Persian subject according to Persian Law applies for and eventually receives a document of Persian nationality known as a sijill-i-ahwal, would either the application or the reception or both together constitute, in the words of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, a ‘ voluntary and formal act ’ by which that person becomes naturalised in a foreign state, so that thenceforth the person concerned shall be deemed to ha\e ceased to be a British subject ? 3. In order to show the bearing of this question in practice I have the honour to enclose notes on actual cases here, in the form of Memoranda (A) to (E). n addition to the persons mentioned in the Memoranda there are a few other persons in Shiraz whose cases are analogous to those mentioned. 4. I venture to express the opinion that the acquisition of a Persian nationality document by a person such as Miss Gerrard is not strictly the same as an act oi naturalisation in a foreign state. Persian Law has imposed Persian nationa i V upon her. 1 his appears to me to be a different thing from giving her the optionof naturalising herself after a number of years’ residence. Apart from this the Persian Government have m similar cases made great difficulties for such persons in regard to several aspects of their lives, with the evident intention of brinmng pressure to bear upon them to apply for a Persian nationality document. For instance it appears probable that if Miss Gerrard were to apply to Persian autho rities for an exit visa upon her British passport enabling her to leave this country, it would be refused. Such persons are therefore driven, through practical reasons to obtain a sijill-i-ahwal Nevertheless they have no intention or wish to re nounce their British nationality, and Miss Gerrard hopes that she is entitled to dual nationality. Miss Gerrard’s argument in fact is, that her application for a sijill-i- ahwal is the inevitable consequence of Persian Law, and not a a voluntary and formal act ” by which she becomes naturalised. If she did not apply for a sijill-i-ahwal she would nevertheless be regarded as a Persian subject by the Persian authori ties, though she would be subjected to certain disabilities arising from the non- regularisaiion of her position in their eyes. In any case the question whether such persons retain their British nationality is one of some importance to consular officers in Persia ; if Miss Gerrard has in fact, though unintentionally, relinquished her British nationality by applying for a sijill-i-ahwal, I must no doubt confiscate her British passport and cease to register her here in future. For this reason I venture to put the question for decision. 5. In connection with Memorandum ‘ C ’ I request that you will be good enough to inform me whether I should take any action under the Persian Supple mentary National Law [enclosure to Serial No. (59)] of the 21st October last on behalf of the infant children. Personally as mentioned in the Memorandum I am of the opinion that as the persons concerned are to all intents and purposes Persian in their dress, speech, relatives, and general outlook on life, it would be a mistake to take any action likely to prejudice their chance of obtaining Persian nationality. 6. If I may venture to prophesy, it appears to me that on or after the 21st October next the Persian Government will take up the attitude that all persons who might have taken advantage of the permission granted in the Supplementary Nationality Law of October 21st, 1930 [enclosure to Serial No. (59)1 but who have not done so will thenceforward become Persian subjects without any trace of foreign nationality. I presume that in that case persons of British nationality who have by Persian Law become Persian subjects but who have not applied for sijill-i- ahwals will be subject to the usual rules as to dual nationals, i.e., they will be en titled to no more than good offices while in Persia. The question of the attitude to be adopted towards such persons if and when they do apply for a sijill-i-ahival depends on the answer to the question which I have ventured to ask in paragraph 2 of this despatch.

He is also referred to in Mr. Davis’ despatch No. 14 to Sir Robert Clive, of the 5th April 1930, paragraphs 5 and 6. (1) Mirza Abul Qasim Khan Basir was born in Shiraz in 1880. He has been registered at this Consulate as a British subject of Indian descedt for many years. His father was the late Mirza Asadullah Khan, known as Haji Mustashir- ul-Mulk, whose great-grandfather, Mjirza Muhammad Khan, Hindustani, was a native of Calcutta. (2) This person has net applied for a sijill-i-aJiical, nor has he taken advantage of the permission accorded by the Supplementary Persian Nationality Law of tke 21st October 1930 to make a declaration of British nationality. (3) He owns a large amount of property in the province of Ears. He is there fore desirous of retaining his Persian nationality (assuming he possesses it) in order that he shall not be obliged to make a forced sale of his properties in accord ance with the Persian Law of June 7th, 1931. He also wishes to retain his British nationality if possible. Enclosure to Shiraz despatch No. 39 of 8th September 1931.

Their mother is a Persian woman. By virtue of an order emanating from the court of the Consul General at Bushire they are wards of the Consul at Shiraz until they reach the age of 21. They are registered here as British subjects. No sijill-i-ahual has been applied for on their behalf. Eatimah Sultan has been supplied with a Temporary Certificate of British Nationality. No action has been taken on their behalf in accordance with the permission given by the Supplementary Persian Nationality law of October 21st, 1931. It seems that as they are to all intents and purposes Persians there would be no point in seeking to divest them of their claim to Persian nationality; more especially as abstention to avail themselves of the above-quoted Persian law will not pre judice their claim to British nationality.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the AotinH BRiTtSH Consul, Shiraz, No. 29, dated The 1st November 1931. I have given careful consideration to your despatch No. 39 of September 8th, in which you enquire whether, if a British subject possessing Persian nationality under the Persian Nationality Law of September 7th, 1929, applies for and receives a sijill-i-ahwal, this is a “ voluntary and f ormal act ” by which that person become^ naturalised in a foreign state and thereby forfeits his British nationality. 2. As you observe in your despatch, the ruling given by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [Serial No. (155)] to the effect that failure on the part of a British Subject, who by PeTsian law has also acquired Persian nationality, to divest himself of his Persian nationality under the Supple mentary Articles of October 21st, 1930, will not deprive that person of his status as a British subject, does not entirely cover this point. I am, however, of the opinion that the ruling of the Secretary of State extends, by implication, to the acceptance of a sijill-i-ahwal. 3. According to the Persian Civil Status Law, all Persian subjects must take out these sijill-i-ahwa 1 (or identity papers) ; this is a formality which follows automatically upon the possession of Persian nationality, and failure to carry out the formality may involve the person concerned in various difficulties arid penalties. If it is permissible in the circumstances here envisaged to acquire or rather retain Persian nationality, v/hether intentionally or otherwise, and still retain British nationality (and in the conditions produced by the Persian Nation ality Law I consider it only right that it should be permissible), I do not consi der that the performance of any act which follows naturally upon the retention of Persian nationality, including the act of applying for a sijill-i-ahwal, can be construed as a formal and voluntary act of naturalisation. 4. As regards the protection of British subjects who are also Persian subjects under the Persian Nationality Law, I am of opinion that the governing factor is pot whether they have or have not applied for a sijjil-i-ahwdl, but whether they have or have not availed themselves of the option accorded to them to divest themselves of their Persian nationality. If they have not done so, they must be presumed to have acquiesced in the imposition upon them of dual nationailiiy, Hud the ordinary rules relating to the protection of persons of dual nationality should apply. Cases may, of course, arise (one has already arisen at Mohammerah), ln w bich the Persian authorities unreasonably claim as a Persian subject, un er Paragraph 2 of Section 1 of Article 1 of the Nationality Law, a person who denies fhat he is a Persian subject under any other section or article. These eases vVu a a special category and each will require special consideration. 5 - My views cannot be regarded as authoritative until they have received the approval of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Adams Aa tlie meanwhile I cannot give you a definite reply to your despatch No. 4U ox MC223FD ° igpnfember 19tli regarding the particular case of Haji Abdul Qasim Khan Basin, but you need take no action tending to deprive persons who receive sijjiU-ahml of their British nationality. 6. I am dealing separately with the point raised in paragraph 5 of yourdes- f p&amp;tch. . . 7 I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty &amp; Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Government of India and to His.

As, however, the Kashmir State Nationality Law contains no reciprocal clause permitting persons ot loreig nationality born in Kashmir to renounce Kashmiri Nationality they must a so admitted to be Persian subjects as well as British protected persons. Hus hem so, they cannot receive British protection in the country of their second na io - ality, vide paragraphs 13-15 of Chapter XXII of General Instructions to K Majesty’s Consular Officers.

His son, All, was born at Basrah, but m'vii bue of his father s nationality is also a British-protected person according to English law. It may be true that Hussain Jemadar has lived in Persia for many years and that he has been employed in the office of the Governor of Mohammerah, but the honourable Ministry will admit that neither of these facts can be adduced as evidence of his Persian nationality, 3. His Majesty’s Legation, understand, nevertheless, that Hussain Jemadar and Ah have within the last few months applied for and received sijiU-i-ahwal and they do not therefore propose to pursue the question of the Persian nationality of these two individuals. . 4. The facts regarding the departure of All for ’Iraq , as given in the honourable Ministry’s note-verbale, are not quite in accordance with the facts as hitherto understood by His Majesty s Legation, but the matter is not now of practical im portance. 5. In conclusion His Majesty’s Legation beg leave to state that the honourable Ministry may rest assured that British Consular Officers will never issue British passports to Persian subjects having no claim to British nationality. That, is not, however, as the honourable Ministry will see, what happened in the present case. With regard to the question of dual nationality, the views of each of the two Govern ments are already well known to the other. No. 2. (Under flying seal to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz.) BRITISH LEGATION', Tehran, February 20ih, 1932. Sir, With reference to paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 27 of November 1st (correspondence page 96) regarding Huss iin Jemadir and his son Aii, I have to inform yon that as His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs lias now approved my view as to the effect on British nationality of the acceptance of sijUl-i-ahwal by persons of dual British and Persian nationality, there will be no objection on the score of nationality to your returning their British passports to the two persons concerned. Whether it will be prudent to do so unless Hussain Jemadar and his son really require to have them in their actual possession is a question which I am willing to leave to the discretion of Mr. Monypenny and your self. Should they desire to travel abroad, it might be preferable to forward the passports to some Consulate outside Persia, to be banded to them there. 2. Hussain Jemadar’s passport is already in your possession. That of Ali, for the return of which Mr. Jakins applied to the local authorities in September, is enclosed herewith, together with copies of correspondence with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explaining how it came into my possession.

With reference to my despatch No. 81 of February 20th regarding the nation- , alitv of a certain Hussein Jemadar of Mohammerah, and his son Ah, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a note that I have now received from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Article XI\ of the law of August 10th, 1894, referred to in this note, reads as follows . ^ , “ Aliens who have come to Persia and have concealed their nationality while residing in the Shah’s dominions and have been treated as Persian subjects or have purchased property which is the exclusive right of Persian subjects shall be recognised as Persian subjects and their claim to foreign protection shall not be admitted . Hussein Jemadar has never concealed his foreign nationality, but it is true that he has purchased land, though this reason is not quoted in the note. 2. The law of 7th September 1929, contains no provision corresponding to Article XIV of the former law, if we except the notorious Article ^ I (1). The Persian argument in applying the former law to a case that has arisen since its abro gation is not, therefore, strictly logical, especially as this process is reversed when it suits the Persian authorities to reverse it. Article I of the law of 1894, for example, reads as follows :— # “ All persons born in Persia are held to be Persian subjects unless at the time of their birth their parents or their fathers are aliens, in which case they are considered aliens”. But persons who fulfil these conditions cannot avail themselves of the provisions of the former law, should they by any mischance fail to fulfil the formalities requi site to divest themselves of the Persian nationality which Article 1(4) or (5) oi the new law forces upon them. _ 3. In all the circumstances, however, and especially in view of the t erms 0 paragraph 3 of the note-verbale enclosed in my despatch No, 81, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by replying to the Persian note. 4.

Despatch from the Political Resident and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars, etc., Bushire, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 64/780, dated the 12th April 1932. I have the honour to bring to your notice the refusal of the Persian authorities at Charbar to recognise a number of Indian merchants as British subjects. The Persian military and Police officials rely on the strict application of the Persian nationality law and have refused to accept the British Passports held by six Haiderabadis (Sind) Khojas on the ground that they were born in Charbar and did not renounce their Persian Nationality and opt for their fathers’ nationality before the 21st October 1931, and that they therefore fall under clauses 4 and 5 of articled of the Persian Nationality Law. Certain particulars have been received by me regarding six individuals and the missing details have been asked for :— 1. Khuda Bakhsh, Son of Abdul Hussain Haidembadi, ' Age 40 Born Charbar. Holds British Passport issued in 1924, 2. Haji Abdul Hussain Haidembadi, Age 60 Born ? Holds British Passport No. 89, Has one son (see 3) born Karachi and 2 daughters born Muscat, 3. Qambar Ali, son of Haji Abdul Hussain Haidembadi. (See 2). Age ? Born Karachi. Included in passport No. 89 (see 2 above). 4. Ghulam Haider, son of Sultan Haiderabadi, Age 37 Born Charbar. Holds British passport No. 110 of Bandar Abbas. This man has been refused permission to go to Muscat to visit his family, 5. Ali Baksh, son of Ghulam Hussain Haiderabadi. Age 30 Born ? Holds British passport No. 9, Bandar Abbas, 1924, 6. Ebrahim, son of Abdul Rasid Haiderabadi. Age ? Grandfather born India. Father born Charbar. Himself born ? Holds British passport No. 11, Bandar Abbas, 1924.Has sons aged 19 and 15. Ebrahim was employed for 8 years in Persian Cus toms bnt discharged in 1924 on account of bis foreign nationality. No public notification of the Persian Nationality Law and its Supplements appears to have been made at Charbar where the Military authorities are in practical control of the administration and the machinery of administration is to say the least exceedingly piimibive. Further owing to the fact that we have no Consular repre sentative there, and that it is therefore very difficult to keep in touch with these isolated British subjects., the requirements of the act passed by the Mejliss on the 21st October 1930 (received with Legation Circular No. 65 of 30th October 1930) was not brought to their notice [Enclosure II to Serial No. (59)}. They were thus totally unaware of the procedure necessary for them to tal e in order that their nationality as British subjects might be recognised by the Persian Government. In these circumstances I would suggest that the Persian Govern ment be asked, having regard to the special conditions prevailing in this outlying portion of the Shah’s dominions, to allow a further period of six months for British subjects born in Persia and resident on the coast between Jask and Gwadur to opt for British nationality and comply with the formalities prescribed in the Persian Nationality Law. Their cases would seem to merit the special consideration contemplated in Tehran Circulars No. 70 and 8 of the 1st November 1931 and 20th February 1932,, respectively.

I beg leave to put a supplementary question, the answer to which would be of grant interest to several persons residing in this consular ares. If a person hitnerto enjoying British nationality who finds himself a Persian subject according to Persian Law applies for and eventually receives a document of Persian nationality known as a siiill-i-auwal , would either the application or the reception or both together constitute, in the words of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, a f voluntary and formal act* by which that person becomes naturalised in a foreign state, bo that thenceforth the person concerned shall be deemed to have ceased to be a Eritieh a ub jec tv 3. In order to show the bearing of this question in practice I have the honour to enclose notes on actual cases here, in the form of Memoranda (A) to (£»}# jn addition to the persons mentioned in the Memoranda * Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, B^itien Legation, Tehran. theretiiara ara a few other pereone in Lhiraz wuoee oaeea are analogous to thosu msntloned, 4. I venture to axpreet the opinion that the acquisition of a Persian nationality document by a per eon such aa Miss Garrard is not strictly.the same as an act of naturalisation in a foreign state* Persian Law has imposed Persian nationality upon her* This appears to n© to be a. different thing from giving her the option of naturalising herself after a number of years' residence. Ap&lt; rt from this, the Persian Government have in similar cases made great difficulties for such persons, in regard tc several aspects of their lives, with the evident intention of bringing press re to bear upon them to apply for a , ereiar nationality document. For instance it appears probable that if Mis® Gerrard were to apply to Persian authorities for ©n exit visa u on her British passport enabling uer to ief.ve this country, it would be refused. Lucn persons arc therefor© driven, through practical reasons, to obtain a si jill-i-anwal . Nevertheless they have no intention or wish to renounce their British nationality, and Miss Gerrard hopes that she is entitled to dual nationality„8Uee Gerr rd’ &amp; argument in fact is, that her application for a eljill-i~ahwal is the inevitable consequence of Persian Law, and not a Voluntary and formal &amp;ct M by which sue becomes naturalised. If sue did not apply for a aijill-i-auwel she would nevertheless be regarded as a i : ersian ©ubjeet by the Persian authorities» though she would be subjected to certain di b bilities arising from the non-regular!eation of her position in their eyes. In any case the q eetion whether such persons retain their British nationality is one of mim importance to consularconsular officers in Persia; if Mies Garrard nas in fact, though unintentionally, relinquished her British nationality hy applying for a Miill-i-ahw al^ I must no doubt confiscate her British passport and cease to register her here in future. For this reason I venture to put the question for decision. 5. In connection with Me;;or&gt;ndum , C t , I request that you will be good enough to inform me whether I should take any act! m under the Persian Supplementary national Law of the 21st October last on behalf of the infant children, personally as mentioned in the Memorandum I am of trie opinion that as the persons concerned are to all intents and purposes i ersian in their dress, speech, relatives, and general outlook on life, it would bo a mistake to take any action likely to prejudice their chance of obtaining Persian nationality. 6. If I may venture to prophesy, it appears to me tuat on or after the 21st October n^xt the Persian Government will take up tae attitude that all persons who might nave taken advantage of the permission granted in the Supplementary Nationality haw of October List 1930 but who nave not done so will thenceforward become Persian subjects without any trace of foreign nationality. I presume that in that case persons of British nationality who have by Persian Law become Persian subjects but who have not applied for si.llll-t-aiiwals will be subject to the usual rules as to dual nationals; i.e# they will be entitled to no more th n good-oflices while in. Persia. The question of the attitude to be adopted towards such persons if and when they do apply for a ei jillij-s^^al depends on the answer to the question which I have ventured to ask in paragraph 2 of this despatch.

He does not possess a British passport* It is understood that he has lately been in Tehran for the purpose of investigating the view take i by the Persian authorities concerning his nationality. The result was that the Persian authorities claim him as Persian. He has made no application to this Consulate under the Supplementary Persian nationality Law of the 21st October 1930* He owns property in ShirazCOPY No, 29# \ British Legation, i Tehran# let Novemberj 1951. O Sir, I have riven careful consideration to your despatch No# 59 of September 8th, in which you enquire whether, if a British subject possessing Persian nationality under the Persian Nationality Law of September 7th, 1929, applies for and receives a s litli-i - a hwal , this is a ’’voluntary and formal act w by which that person becomes naturalised in a foreign state and thereby forfeits his British nationality# 2. As you observe in your despatch, the ruling given by His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the effect that failure on the part of a British subject, who by Persian law has also acquired Persian nationality, to divest himself of his Persian nationality under the Supplementary Articles of October 21st, 1950, will not deprive that person of his status as a British subject, does not entirely cover this point. X am, however, of the opinion that the ruling of the fee ret ary of State extends, by implication, to the acceptance of a si jlll^l-ahwal . 5# According to the Persian Civil Status Law, all \Persian subjects must take out these sijili-i-shwal (or identity papers)* this is a formality which follows automatically upon the possession of Persian nationality, and failure to carry out the formality may involve the person &lt;i0 Shlpa* rltl,!h Coilaul »*person concerned in various difficulties and penalties. If it Is permissible in the circumstances here envisaged to acquire or rather retain Persian nationality, whether intentionally or otherwise, and still retain British nationality (and. in the conditions produced by the Persian Nationality Law X consider it only right that it should be permissible), I do not consider that the performance of any act which follows naturally upon the retention of Persian nationality, including the act of applying for a J-iiii-ahw&amp;l , can be construed as a formal and voluntary act of naturalisation. 4. As regards the protection of British subjects who are also Persian subjects under the Persian Nationality La?/, I am of opinion that the governing factor Is not whether they have or have not applied for a aljiU-l-anwal » but whether they have or have not availed themselves of the option accorded to them to divest themselves of their Persian nationality. If they nave not done so, they must be presumed to have acquiesced in the imposition upon them of dual nationality, and the ordinary rules relating to the protection of persons of dual nationality should apply. Case® may, of course, arise (one has already arisen at Moharamarah), In which the Persian authorities unreasonably claim as a Persian subject, under paragraph 2 of Section 1 of Article 1 of the Nationality Law, a person who denies that he is a Persian subject under any other section or article, these cases will fall into a special category and each will require special consideration# 5. My views cannot be regarded as authoritative until they have received the approval of Hi® Majesty r s Principal SecretarySecretary of ftate for Foraign Affairs. i n the meanwhile I cannot give you a definite reply to your despatch Ho. 40 of September 19th regarding the particular case of Eaji Abdul Qaeim Khan basiri, but you need take no action tending to deprive persons who receive ayill-l-anwal of their British nationality. 8.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the Govern ment of India’s telegram of 23rd February, No. 529-S. [Serial No. (81)]. 2. The Secretary of State agrees that the suggestions as to a general policy made in the third paragraph of the India Office letter of 20th November last, P.-453^30 [Serial No. (62)], could not have any application to the precise deter mination of such legal questions as may arise from time to time from the nationality laws of foreign countries, as recently in Persia. The question of the effect of the Persian Nationality Law on the status of children born in Persia of British protected persons of Indian origin is being dealt with separately, and pending the Government of India’s consideration of the possibility of adopting a Kurrami Nationality Law and any similar action in certain Indian States, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has been given* the instructions contained in the telegram of 14th January [Serial No. (79) ], from the Foreign Office of which copy was enclosed in my weekly letter of 22nd January, under No. P.Z.-334|31. 3. It may be preferable to leave aside special legal questions of this nature (which will have to be settled specially as they arise) in considering the reply to be returned to the Foreign Office letter of 14th July 1930 [Serial No.'(39)]. That letter raises a general question (arising out of an enquiry from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Cairo), viz., whether it is desirable to formulate definite rules as to the status of children born abroad of British protected persons for the guidance of consular officers in dealing with cases which may arise. The Sec retary of State presumes that such cases as might arise would be, for example, in connexion with applications for advice, assistance or protection from persons in regard to whom it might be doubtful whether or not they were “ natives, nationals or subjects ” of one of the territories enumerated in the Annex to Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions under the law or practice obtaining m such territory. So far as such persons of Indian origin are concerned, it appeared to the Secretary of State that diversities of law and practice might make it a difficult matter to formulate definite rules. If the Government of India share this view, it might be sufficient to suggest to the Foreign Office that any cases of doubtful status of individuals which may arise in the ordinary course ol consular business under Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions should be leierred individually to the authorities in India for advice if and when such cases arise, and that more general legal questions arising in particular countries (or example as a result of the nationality laws in force there, as recently in ersia)_ should also be dealt 'with specially as regards each country as and when they arise. ^ j No. 396|1|7, dated the 13th April 1931. m .'Pl S Consul-General at Meshed presents his compliments to th ivnlfcS + t0 tI 1 ie Government of India, Simla and has the honour t transmit to him the under-mentioned documents : To His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary a the Court of Persia, Tehran, No. 7 of April 13, 1931.

If it be proposed that the status of a British Protected Person when he is abroad be regarded as applying to his descendants under conditions precisely analogous to those governing the status of British subjects, I beg leave to draw attention to the fact that in that event it will be necessary for reciprocity to be accorded under the Law (if any) of the Native State to the descendants of Persians born in the territory of that Native State. 3. In this connection I would draw your attention to paragraph 3 (ii) of letter No. T. 8879|9|378 of the 18th August, 1930, from the Foreign Office to the India Office [Serial No. (44)]. 4.

Na 'With reference to my telegram* No. 52, of the 11th instant relative to the certificates to be given to British subjects bom in Pensia who desire to avail themselves of the provisions of the Persian Nationality Law in regard to option for their father's nationality, I shall be glad if you will circulate to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia co-pies of the enclosed documents which shovr (1) the form of Statutory Declaration which should be completed by applicants for certificates of British nationality and (2) the form of certificate which should be furnished to persons who produce satisfactory evidence that they are natural born British subjects. 2. In deciding under which clause of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914-1922 applicants have derived their British nationality, His Majesty's Consular Officers should be guided by the memorandum circulated to them under cover of Foreign Office circular T.-8810I8810I378 of the 25th October 1928. 3. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs proposes to consult His Majesty’s Governments in the various Dominions as to the form of certificate to be given in the case of British subjects more closely connected with one or other of the Dominions, and pending the issue of further instructions such cases should be referred to the Foreign Office. 4. The case of British protected persons must also be considered. The majority of persons in this category in Persia no doubt derive their status by reason of birth in, or descent from a person born in, one of the native States of India, and applications for certificates by these persons should be referred direct to the Government of India, who should be a.sked to say whether certificates may be issued and if so to indicate what form the certificate should take. Simi larly in the case of British protected persons from other Protectorates or Pro tected States, reference should be made to the competent authority in the territory from which the applicant emanates.

Subject to such observations Mr. Henderson would suggest that applicants for the certificates should be required to make a Statutory Declaration stating the facts on which the right to British nationality 7 is based, and that the certificate should take the torm of a recital of the facts given in the Statutory 7 Declaration, with a state ment that on the basis of these facts the person concerned is (under the appro priate section of the relevant Act) a British subject. It is suggested that the certificates should be issued by T His Majesty 7 ’s Minister at Tehran or by His Majesty’s Consular Officers, cases in which any doubt arises being referred to the Secretary of State for instructions.

From a perusal of the Persian Law of Nationality promulgated on Sep tember the 7th, 1929 [Enel, to Serial No. (8) in F. 52-N.|29], (copy forwarded with letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment No. F. 204-N. ! 28, dated the 24th September 1930) [Serial No. (45)] it will be observed that in order to secure the right to receive British protection in Persia to descendants born in Persia of an emigrant from a place, the nationals of which are British protected persons, two conditions must be ful filled. It is necessary that there .should be a nationality law for that place which provides :— (1) that descendants born abroad of a subject migrating from that place possess the status of a subject of that place for the requisite num ber of generations : Vide Article II of the Persian Law of Nationality ; and (2) that children born in that place to Persian fathers have the right of renouncing the nationality of that place on attaining the age of 18 years. Vide Article lil of the Persian Law of Nationality. 3. The class of British protected persons in the North-West Frontier Pro vince most concerned are emigrants from the Kurram Valley and for the pre sent at any rate the Government of India consider that it will be sufficient if necessary measures are taken to secure to these emigrants the risht to receive British protection in Persia. I am to suggest therefore that the Turi Jirga be summoned and their wishes in the matter ascertained. If possible a petition should be taken from them recording the facts that : (a) descendants of Turi emigrants born abroad are considered to be Kurrami nationals for two generations ; and (b) descendants of foreigners born in the Kurram have the right of retaining the nationality of their country of origin (and inci dentally of renouncing Kurram nationality) on attaining the age of 18 years. A document of this description would, the Government of India are advised, be adequate for the purpose intended. As under Article I of the Supplementary Persian Nationality Law [Enel, to Serial No. (59)] passed on the 21st October 1930 (copy forwarded with endorsement [Serial No. (102)] from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. 204-N.J28, dated the 5th June 1931) it will be necessary tpr descendants of Kurram emigrants, if they are to retain the light to British protection, to furnish certificates by the 21st October 1931 to tiie Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that they are recognised as nationals oi their place ol: origin, I am to request that the Tnri Jirga be sum moned as soon as possible and a declaration obtained from them in the terms suggested above. dll) Endorsement No. F. 204-N.|28, dated the 16th June 1931. m £ ®2?VL let l e r t 0 ,«'?

The case of British protected persons must also be considered. The majority of persons in this category in Persia no doubt derive their status by reason of birth in, or descent from a person born in, one of the native States of India, and applications for certificates by^fhese persons should be referred direct to the Government of India, who should be asked to say whether certi ficates may be issued and if so to indicate what form the certificate should take. Similarly in the ease of British protected persons from other Protec torates or Protected States, reference should be made to the competent autho rity in the territory from which the applicant emanates.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the Persian Nationahty Law of 1929 and to the two Supplementary Articles of that Law passed on the 21st October, 1930, and to enquire whether the omission, be it intentional or uninten tional, on the part of a British subject, who by tfm Persian Law has now also acquired Persian citizenship, to avail himself, within the sanctioned period, of the option of renunciation of his Persian Nationality, is to be construed as an act involving, in the sense of paragraph 14 of Chapter XXV of the General Instructions to Consular Officers, loss of British Nationality, or whether by that omission, intentional or unintentional, he merely retains that dual nationality, acquired by the Persian Law, in the sense of paragraph 24: (b) of the same Chapter. 2. In view of the recently ^enacted law providing for the compulsory sale of agricultural xmoperty in Persia owned by foreigners and for other reasons of a like nature, renunciation of their Persian nationality may involve material dis advantages for some British subjects. If failure to exercise the option of renouncing Persian nationality implies the loss of British nationality, such persons will be faced with a choice between their material advantage and their loyalty to their British connexion ; and it means that loyalty will be penalised. 3. I beg leave to request your early instructions on this subject, preferably by telegraph. 4. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

With regard to paragraph 2 of your letter, I am to observe that the case of a person born in Persia before the 1st January 1915, whose father at the time of that person’s birth was a British subject, is covered by the first proviso to Section 1 (l) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts, 1914-1922, since that proviso is retrospective in effect. A fresh paragraph (3) explaining this point has been inserted in the despatch to Sir R. Clive. 3.

J.Z. 1130/31. India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. S7th March, 1931 # General question of descendants born abroad of British protected persons. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the Government of India’s telegram of 83rd February, No. 529-S. 2. The Secretary of State agrees that the suggestion as to a general policy made in the third paragraph of the India Office letter of 20th November last, P.4533/30, could not have any application to the precise determination of such legal questions as may arise from time to time from the nationality laws of foreign countries, as recently in Persia. The question of the effect of the Persian Nationality Law on the status of children born in Persia of British protected persons of Indian origin is being dealt with separately, and pending the Government of India’s consideration of t^e possibility of adopting a Kurrami Nationality Law and any similar action in certain Indian States, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has been given the instructions contained in the telegram of 14th January from the Foreign Office of which copy was enclosed in my weekly letter of 22nd January under No. P.Z.334/31. 3. It may be preferable to leave aside special legal questions of this nature (which will have to be settled specially as they arise) in considering the tgoxj returned to the Foreign Office letter of 14th July, 1930. That letter raises a general question (arising out of an enquiry from His Majesty's Consul-General at Cairo), viz,., whether/ Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department.whether it is desirable to formulate definite rules as to the status of children horn abroad of British protected persons for the guidance of consular officers in dealing with cases which may arise. The Secretary of State presumes that such cases as might arise would be, for example, in connexion with applications for advice, assistance or protection from persons in regard to whom it might be doubtful whether or net they were ,f natives, nationals or subQects Tr of one of the territories enumerated in the .annex to Chapter XLII of the Consular Instructions under the law or practice obtaining in such territory. So far as such persons of Indian origin are concerned, it appeared to the Secretary of State that diversities of law and practice might make it a difficult matter to formulate definite rules. If the Government of India share this view, it might be sufficient to suggest to the Foreign Office that any cases of doubtful status of individuals which may arise in the ordinary course of consular business under Chapter XXT T of the Consular Instructions should be referred individually to the authorities in India for advice if and when such cases arise, and that more general legal quest!ons arising in particular countries (for example, as a result of the nationality laws in force there, as recently in Persia) should also be dealt with specially as regards each country as and when they arise.

With reference to Foreign Office letter T 13037/121/378 of the 6th ultimo relative to the steps to he taken hy British subjects v/ho desire to take advantage of Article 2 of the Persian Nationality Law of the 7th September, 1929, I am directed b;y Mi.Secretary Henderson to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran regarding one position of children born in Persia of British subjects one of whom was born in Persia, who had not reached the age of eighteen before the passage of the Act. 2. It is clear from the supplementary law of the 21st October, 1930, a translation of which was enclosed in the letter referred to above, that the law of 1929 is retro-active in the sense that it applies to persons born before its enactment, but Mr. Henderson does not consider that any useful purpose would be served by making further representations to the Persian G-overnment on the subject. 3. The question of making the provisions of the law known to the British subjects concerned, and of deciding the form of certificate of British nationality to be given to applicants, has, however, become one of some urgency, and Mr. Henderson would be glad to receive at an early date the observations of the Secretary of State for India on the matter. Subject to such observations, Mr. Henderson w T ould suggest that applicants Jnder Secretary of State, India Office. y /•-. •- T • v v f-nf, i PMywwBHMiu u-iy&gt; J &lt;W0) applicants for the certificates should he required to make a Statutory Declaration stating the facts on which the right to British nationality is Based, and that the certificates should take the form of a recital of the facts given in the Statutory Declaration, with a statement that on the Basis of these facts the person concerned is, (under the appropriate section of the relevant Act) a British subject. it is suggested that the certificates should be issued by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran or by His Majesty's Consular Officers, cases in which any doubt arises being referred to the Secretary of State for instructions• 4. A similar letter has been addressed to the Home Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,15O5l/l2l/3 70) 587. British legation, Tehran. 11 th December, 1930. Sir, I have the honour to request your reference to Sir Bobert Clive's despatch No.378 of the 5th August last and to my despatch No.528 of the 30th October last, both on the subject of the new Persian Nationality Law of 1308. 2. The concluding paragraph of the note No. 9764/1302 dated the 6 th Murdad 1309 (28th July 1930) was construed here as meaning that the Act in question would not have retroactive effect. It now appears, however, that this construction is incorrect. 3. In a case which has recently arisen, with the details of which I need not trouble you, it has been ruled by the Persian Government that the child born in Persia of British subjects, one of whom was born in Persia, and not having attained the age of eighteen before the passage of the Act, is by virtue of Section 4 of Article I of the Act of 1308 a Persian subject, but he has the right of option within one year after attaining his 18th birthday. 4 . I enclose for your perusal copies of the final notes exchanged on the subject of this particular case with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 13th October and 9th November last. 5 . It follows from the principle of retroactivity here implied that the children horn in Persia Sight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office.Persia of British parents, coming under Article III of the Act, who had not attained the age of eighteen before the passage of the Act are Persian subjects in contemplation of Persian Law, but have the right of option on attaining the age of eighteen. -i-® not thought that many children of European descent will be affected by this ruling, but it is possible that a number of children of British subjects of Asiatic descent, formerly accented by the Persian Government as British subjects, will now be considered Persian subjects until and unless they exercise their right of option. 7, I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty T s High Commissioner, Baghdad, and all Consuls in Persia, as pending instructions from you as to whether I am to make further representations on the subject to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I consider it desirable that British subjects should, in so far as possible, be warned of this interpretation of the Persian Law.

I regret that I am unable to understand how the young man can now be considered a Persian subject since he was born a British subject, in contemplation of both Persian law and British law, before the passing of the Act of 1308, and as Your Highness states that the said Act has no retroactive effect, he must surely remain a British subject. 3. By British law he cannot renounce his British nationality until he is of full age, that is, twenty one, but it is possible, in contemplation of lersian law that he can acquire Persian Nationality by option at the age at the age of eighteen. In such event he would enjoy dual nationality unless and until he renounced his original nationality on attaining the age of twenty one. 4.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to the letter from the Foreign Office of the 14th July, ho. T. 7115 / 9 / 3 VB, of which a copy was sent to you with my weekly letter of the 17th July, on the general question whether aol how far the right to British protection shouli te regarded as persisting in the descendants horn abroad of British protected persons. The interest of the Government of India in this question would appear to extend to the natives of Indian States, of tribal territories and of places such as Bahrein aid. the Trucial Coast which enjoy a measure of British protection. The Secretary of State is disposed to think that little advantage would be gained by an exhaustive enquiry into the existence and nature oi the raws or pi actio obtaining in these territories in respect of the question raised in the Idrei^ Office letter. He would, however, be glad if the Government of India would examine the question in its general aspect and furnish him with their views. lf it is considered possible or desirable to lay down a general ruling on the subject, the Secretary of State ^ pt of -policy, tb.e status , x. v,v -f-hftt as a matter ox , is disposed to tbinx tna » of a Briti sli-proteoted. person, for the purpose of according British px.t-.10.' ■»“ “ “ ' 18 “ b * 5t regarded/ Ibe Secretary to the GovernmentfOf India,^.^ Departmellt .P.4533/1930 HO.

I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to refer to your letter of the 8th ^pril last (P 2252} and previous correspondence relative to the status of subjects of Indian States and ^ency territories and of their descendants resident in Persia and Iraq. 2. Mr. Henderson has now received from His Majesty^ Consul-General at Cairo a despatch, of which a copy is enclosed, enquiring whether the definition of British protected person in paragraph 10 (b) of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions covers children of age of natives of British protected States if born either in a country where His Majesty exercises ex-territorial jurisdiction or in any other foreign country. 3. The question raised is a wide one, having regard to the large number of such States, as set forth in the Annex to Chapter XXII, and it may be presumed that considerable diversity exists between the laws, or possibly practice only, of those territories in regard to the recognition of the children born abroad of persons originating there as possessing a national or quasi-national status. It appears however to Mr. Henderson that it would be desirable that some definite rules should be formulated, for the guidance of His Majesty 1 s Consular officers, in dealing with cases wmcn may arise within their respective districts. He would accordingly be glad, in so far as may appertain to your department, to be furnished/ •he Under-Secretary of State, India Office.fti 2 nnsli 6 &amp; with Mr* Sscrstary BGnn's ohsGPvo.tions on the various categories of persons referred to, and the procedure which might he adopted in dealing with their applications to he accorded British protection abroad. 4* In this connexion it would seem important to determine the number of generations horn abroad to which the status of origin of such persons, on which their claim to he regarded as British protected persons is founded might he deemed to extend. In cases where no native law exists, the matter seems one which must he determined as a matter of policy, and even in cases where a nationality law may perhaps exist allowing an unlimited transmission of national status, the question seems to arise whether British protection should as a matter of policy he extended beyond a limited number of generations horn abroad. On these points also Mr. Henderson would he glad to receive Mr* Benn’s observations. 5. As regards paragraph 3 of Mr. Hahino , s despatch, I am to add that he is being instructed to delete from the Consular Register of Births of British subjects entries relating to all births other than those oi natural-born British subjects. 6. A similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office, to whom a copy of your letter of the 8th April last is also being sent. I am, etc., (Sd. ) G.R.

I am somewhat disturbed, for the reasons set forth below, at the decision which has been reached in respect of the Kurrami community in Persia by the Government of India and which has received your confirmation (vide your telegram to me No.140 of the 19th instant). 3. For very many years natives of the Kurram, as well as their children and grandchildren born in this country, have been registered at this Consulate-General and at other Consulates in Persia as British Protected Persons, and have been accepted as such by the Persian Government. 4. A number of these persons who were bom in Persia have been registered for many years, have regularly renewed their registration on payment of the fees obtaining under Order in Council, and have received recognition from the Persian Government as foreign subjects. 5. It would, in my opinion, be the cause of great hard ship, if not a definite breach of faith, to abandon these people at this late stage to the tender mercies of the Persian Government. A ^ight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., THE FOREIGN OFFICE.Government• 6. I do on the other hand consider it undesirable to extend to those natives of the Kurram, born in Persia, who have not hitherto registered at a Consulate in Persia, the status of British Protected Persons, and I venture to suggest that special measures may be adopted to ensure the continuance of British Protection to those children of Kurrami immigrants, and their children of the first generation, born in Persia before the 10th 1928 (the date of the abolition of extra territorial jurisdiction) who were registered as British Protected Persons before that date. This measure will ensure that no hardship falls on those registered during the capitulatory regime in Persia. 7. With reference to your telegram Bo.140 of the 19th instant, it is not quite clear to me what is meant by the phrase f of numbers of persons of Indian race etc.* It is not the new Persian Law which affects the Kurramis and Kashmiris, but the conclusions reached by the Government of India. 8. There are some one hundred and fifty Kurramis, born in Persia, who with their Persian wives and offspring are registered as British Protected Persons at this Consulate- General, and there are some forty so registered at His Majesty f s Vice-Consulate at Resht, and probably an equivalent number in Meshed.

BRITISH LEGATION TEHRAN. 25th June, 1930.Gulliek. 25tli June, 1930. Monsieur le Min1stre, I have the honour to invite a reference hy Your Highness to the Persian Nat ionality Law passed hy the Majlis on the 7th September,1929, and now in force, and, hy direct ion of my Government, to submit to Your Highness observations on the possible interpretation of certain Articles of the Law in so far as British subjects resident in or visiting this country may be affected. 2. I would preface my remarks by reminding Your Highness that in Great Britain before any individual can be accepted as a British National he must submit incontrovertible evidence- of his rights to that status, and until he has so proved his claim he is regarded as an alien. 3. The principle underlying the Persian Nationality Law is however quite contrary. Unless a person on Persian territory can prove his foreign nationality ne is considered by the provisions of the Act a national of Persia. 4. This principle, dictated doubtless for reasons peculiar to Persia, will indubitaoly cause from time to time difficulties to bona fide British subjects in Persian territory as instanced by the text ox Article I (l) of the Persian Act . His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Foroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran.5. According to the text of this particular Article it is open to the Persian Governnent to refuse to recognise the British nationality of a person whenever the Persian Government ’objects to’ that person’s documents of nationality. 5. My Governnent is anxious that I should receive an assurance from the Persian Governnent that the provision of this article will he carried out in a reasonable spirit, and that a person’s claim to British nationality will not be ignored or refused by a mere objection to his documents or his lack of them, and that he will be given reasonable time to substantiate his claim to British nationality. 7. With reference to Article III of the Persian Act, I beg to enclose for Your Highness’ information, a copy of Article 14 paragraphs (l) and (2) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 as amended up to August 4th 1923, which Act is now in force in Great Britain. 3. In conformity with this Act a person, who b virtue of his birth on British soil etcetera, is a British subject, but who by the law of Persia is also a Persian subject, may at the age of 21 (the full age m Great Britain) and at any t renounce his British Nationality, and will therssfter be recognised as a Persian subject in Great Britain. 9. I shall he glad to receive the assurance of the Persian Governnent in virtue of Article HI of ins Persian Nat ionality Law, that reciprocal treatment in thisthis repsectwill he accorded to persons horn in Persia and who according to that Law are Persian subjects, hut who are also in British law British subjects, and that such persons, on reaching full age (in Persia 18) and any time thereafter , may renounce their Persian nationality, and will thereafter he recognised in Persia as British subjects, and that in such cases Article III will override Article II of the said Law. 10. I would also refer Your Highness to Article XIII paragraph (3) and I should he glad to receive an assurance from the Persian Government that persons who in virtue of Article II (or, as the case may/be, Article III), renounce their Persian Nationality, are not penalised in accordance with Article XIII (3) and will enjoy no less generous rights in Persia than those already allowed by law to their fathers in the matter of immovable property. 11, Finally I have the honour to draw Your Highness’ attention to the fact that the provisions of this Law are, in mary essentials, at variance with the previously valid Persian Nat ionality Law, and in consequence I beg leave to enquire whether it is the intention of the Persian Government to give retroactive and retrospective effect to ths new law and whether, as a consequence, legal decisions taken by the Persian Governmert on the basis of the previous enactment will now be considered as null and void. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (8 igne d) R. H.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 25t-ll April, 1930. 0 Sir, I have received your despatch ho. 506 of the 4th October last relative to the new Pers ian Hat ionality Law, and I observe that the points mentioned in your note of the 24th August last to the Persian Government appear, in some measure, to have been disposed of by the amendments introduced into articles 2, 9 and 11 of the definite text. 2. It appears from your despatch Ho. 7 M of the 51st January last to His Majesty’s Consul at Basra, a copy of which was transmitted to me under coverjof your despatch I Ho. 60 of the same date, that a supplementary bill is shortly to be voted whereby the question of the retroactivity of the law will be settled. The references in that despatch to articles 4, 5 and 6 of the law are not clear, but it it assumed that the articles in question are Hos. 1 (4), 1 (5) and 2 respectively. 3. There remains the question whetherjunder article 3 it will be open to British subjects who are also regarded as Persian subjects to renounce Persian nationalit}^ - at any time after attaining their majority,* and I presume you will press the Persian Cover me nt for a reply on this point. The question of the renunciation of Persian nationality by widows under article 11 appears to be sufficiently covered by the amendment finally adopted in that article. It is, however, to be observed that a woman who before her marriage was a British subject can in Sir Robert H, Clive ,K. C .M .G ., et e., et c., et c., et c ., Tehran.in English law only regain her British nationality hy naturalisation under section 2 (5) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and that no provision exists for 'resumption' of British nat ronality “by such persons. The exact meaning ofthe words 'separation from' in article 11 is not clear, but presumably it contemplates an actual dissolution of the marriage and not a mere separation. 4. As regards the objectionable features of article I (l) of the laxv, it seems improbable that cases of persons with a valid claim to British nationality who are unable to substantiate their claims to the satisfaction of the Persian authorities will be of frequent occurrence, aid that generally such conditions would only arise where a British subject was temporarily without documentary evidence of his national status. Provided, therefore, an assurance can be obtained from the Persian Government that this provision will be carried out in a reasonable spirit, ao as to afford such persons an opportunity to establish their British nationality, it is not open to serious objection. 5. I t is not clear from the text of the la?/ to what extent British subjects may be affected by the somewhat onerous conditions imposed by article 13 on persons relinquishing Persian nationality and it is important that an assurance should, if possible, be obtained from the Persian Government that these provisions do not apply to persons of dual nationality who renounce Persian nat ionality in accordance with the terms of article 2 or6* I shall he glad if you will make representations to the Persian Govermerit in the above sense and endeavour to obtain from them the assurances mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 above* You should, at the same tim$, press them for an expression of their views on the questions already raised in your previous communicat ion which are not covered by the amendments adopted in the final text of the law.

As has already Been explained, a number of applications for registration as Bri ti sh Protected Persons have been received in this Secretariat from sons born in ’Iraq of natives of Indian States. The applicants have not been registered, pending a reply from the Government of India to the letter quoted above. Recently, however, two of these applicants, named Hassan s/o Saleh and Haji Muhammad s/o Muhammad Kazim, who were born in Kerbela of fathers born in Kashmir State, applied to this Secretariat for urgent nassport facilities in order to proceed on a oilgrim- age to Persia. As they would not otherwise have been ‘ I able to obtain the necessary Persian visas, they were granted in the Secretariat British Passports (Nos. 844 and 845 dated the 27th of March, 1930) of which the validity was restricted to six months only. 3.

I am directed to refer ~to the papers forwarded wft&amp; my weekly letter Ho,15-M, dated the 6th February 1930, regarding the national status of subjects of Indian States and Agency territories and of their descendants domiciled A in Persia and Iraq and to forward for your information h / the following account of the conclusions arrived at by the Government of India on the subject. 2. It ?^ill be seen from these papers that a large number of Kashmiris and Kurramis and their descendants are 9 residing at Meshed, Tehran and other places in Persia and Iraq • An original emigrant from Kashmir or the Kurram is a native of Kashmir or the Kurram, as the case may be,and, therefore, (since an Agency area such as the Kurram,being included in India, though not in British India,' possesses the same juristic status as a State in India, sucn as Kasnmir, i h A enjoys the status oi a British protected K . person under clause [jt) of paragraph in in Chapter AXII of Consular Instructions and, subject to the provisions of paragraph 13 of that Chapter, is entitled to receive ijj'M British1 , ^ rk 'Kj, '■'U .Britisli protection in the foreign country of his residence. The question^which arise are : - (a) whether, and if so to what extent, a descendant in the male line of the original emigrant horn in the foreign country inherits the status of a British protected person? (h) The extent to which the recently enacted Per sian Law of nationality will operate to confer Persian nationality on an emigrant to Persia and his descendants and thereby to deprive them, as the result of paragraph 15 in Chapter XXII of Consular Instructions, of any right to British protection in Persia which they would otherwise enjoy. 3, question (a). Prom the fact that possession of the status of a British protected person depends on possession of the status of a subject of a British Protected State,it follows that the question whether a descendant born in a foreign country of e.g., a Kashmiri or a Kurrami who migrated to that country possesses the status of a British protected person can only be determined by his possession or otherwise of the status of a Kashmiri or of a Kurrami l subject. It will be seen from the Kashmir Durbar letter Ho.3783-P.R., dated the 15th March 1929, that there is some sort of a Kashmir nationality law, to the effect that Kasmniri nationality persists for two generations i.e.,tne sons and grandsons, born abroad, of a Kashmiri subject inherit the status of a Kashmiri subject and therewith the status of a British protected person. The Kurram however has no such law and it can only be assumed that the status of a Kurram subject and therewith the status oi a British protected person does not descend even to the first genera tion of a Kurrami born acroad# Question (b). The answer to this question depends on the effect of the new Persian Law of nationality. An originaloriginal emigrant to Persia from Kashmir or the Kurram will, it may be presumed, 'be in a position to establish his possession of Kashmiri or Kurrami nationality, as the case may be, to the satisfaction of the Persian Government, and will, therefore, not become a Persian subject under the operation of clause (l) of Article I, nor will any of the remaining clauses in that Article cause him to become a Persian subject. Hejvvill not, therefore, become subject to the rule contained in paragraph 13 of Chapter XXII of Consular Instructions and will retain his right to receive British protection in Persia in his capacity of British protected person. X son born in Persia to an original male emigrant will, if he remains in Persia, become a Persian subject at the age of eighteen under the operation of clause ( 4 ) of Article I, tut under Articles II and III he will be entitled to divest himself of Persian nationality within one year of attaining that age? subject to the fulfilment of two conditions; namely,first, that he possesses a second nationality, in this case Kashmiri or Khrrami nationality, as the case may ce, secondly, that the law of Kashmir or the Kurram, as the case may be, recognises the right of a person corn of 1 Persian parents in the Kurram or in Kashmir and thereby j acquiring Kurrami or Kashmiri nationality to discard his Kurrami or Kashmiri nationality at the age of 18 and for : at least a year afterwards. In the case of the son of an original Kashmiri emigrant the first condition will oe fulfilled, hut the second will not, because so far as the Government of India are aware there is no such provision in the Kashmir Law of nationality. In the case of the Kurrami emigrant neither condition is fulfilled, because the Kurram has no nationality law. The son of the Kashmiri emigrantemigrant then will retain the status of a British protected person, but will lose his right to British protection in Persia under the operation of paragraph 13 in Chapter XXII emigrant will not possess the status of a British protected person, while, if he possessed that status, he would equally with the son of the Kashmiri emigrant be deprived of the right to receive British protection in Persia. not in issue at present, but it appears that, in view of Act, 1914, Article III of the new Persian Law of nationality will not affect the right of the son born in Persia of a British subject and residing in Persia when he attains the age of 18 to divest himself of Persian nationality under Article II. A son who is entitled to, and does, exercise the right conferred by Article II will not be a Persian subject and in the ease where the original emigrant was a British subject the right of divestment of Persian nationality will survive to all descendants in the male fine ad infinitum nationality and Status of Aliens Act. Pailure to keep aliv the status of British subject by registration will however involve the loss of that status in the second generation born abroad (vide sub- clause (i) of clause (b) of sub- . --- ■ - ~ - section (l) of section 1 of the Act; and the acquisition of natively under the operation of clause U) or clause (5) of of Consular Instructions, while the son of the Kurrami 5. The case of British subjects residing in Persia is section 14 of the British nationality and Status of Aliens so long as the father keeps the British nationality oi the son alive by registering his birth under sub-clause (v} of clause (b) of sub-section (l) of section 1 of the British ' Persian nationality under the operation of the proviso set up hy clause U) of Article I of the Persian Law or alter Article X for the ousting of which Article II will no longer be available.

The question now at issue seems to me to be whether the second and subse quent generations of these Kashmiris, born in Persia, can be recognised as British Protected Persons, Natives of Kashmir, and be registered as such in tUn gisters of His Majesty’s Consulates in Persia. re ~ 5. 1 his question affects immediately a still larger number of another cla^q who have migrated to Persia and show no apparent intention of returning in India, viz., the Kurramis. ® 10 6. These people have, in the past, been recognised as British Protected Per sons, Natives of the Kurram, and many have registered as such at His Majesty’s Consulates at Tehran, Resht and Meshed. Their children, born in Persia have equally been registered on the cards of the Registry and their names entered on the Registration Certificates of their parents, and when they have grown no they have been issued with separate Registration Certificates. /.A huge number, resident in Mazanderan and Asterabad where they ply their various professions, generally as cultivators, have never registered them- selves. Except for the small Kurrami community in Tehran, who are mostly •butchers by trade and who are comparatively prosperous, the general Kurrami community m Persia is very poor. S.

Subject:- National Status of Kurramis in Persia, I have the honour to invite a reference to Colonel Biscoe's despatch ho.72/19/4 of tne 24tn of January 1929, v/itn regard to tne national status of Kurramis in Persia. Colone** niscoe recommended that as Kurram was agency terri tory and not a native state, Kurramis in future should be registered as British subjects and not as Britisn protected persons. Tne point is important, ‘because if the fathers born in tne Kurram enjoy the status of Britisn subjects, their * sons born in Persia prior to the abolition of tne capitulations are likewise entitled to British nationality unlike the off spring torn in Meshed of persons originating in Kashmir whose case was dealt with in your despatch ho.B204/K, dated tne 5th of December 1928. 2. as a great many temporary certificates of British nationality given to Kurramis and their sons which are valid for one year only are awaiting renewal or replacement by passports, I beg the favour of instructions as to whether I am to proceed on the lines suggested by colonel Biscoe in the third paragraph of his despatch of the 24tn J&amp;nu^ry 1929. 3. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tenran.Confiaential.

I should add that cnildren born in ’Iraq of persons entitled to British protection by reason of their birth in one of the Dative States of India do not automatically acquire ’Iraq Nationality under ’Iraq law. Therefore there would no local objection to their being registered here as British protected persons. On the other hand, as their status under both British and International haw would seem to ce obscure, and in view of the fact that a number of applications or this character have recently been received, his Excellency wouia be grateful for a ruling on the subject as soon as possible. 3 . a copy of tnxs letter is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents nis compliments to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the documen^mentioned in the sub-joined Scnedule , on the ! subject of Tne Persian LaY/ of Rationality.Ho.506.

Persian Nationality Law the claim of the Indian born children of the Hazaras settled in Khorasan to be regarded as British subjects has become somewhat doubtful* 2. These children were in almost all cases born in ^uett while their fathers were serving in the Hazara Pioneers and were brought to Persia at an early age by their parents who are claimed, and are now actually being registered, as Persian subjects. The children have no intention of returning to India end have to all intents and purposes become domiciled in this country along with their parents. Their main object in obtaining British documents of nationality is simply to avoid being registered as Persian subjects, and so to evade the obligations of Persian citizenship when they come of age, such es conscription, national dress, etc. 3. Under Section l(l)(a) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act these children would appear to be British subjects by birth. But Sub-section 2 of Article 1 of the recent Persian Nationality Law states that 'all those persons whose fathers are Persian, whether those persons were born in PersiaPersia or abroad' are deemed Persian subjects. This sub section is somewhat loosely worded and it is not clear whether it is intended to apply to all persons whose fathers were Persian subjects at the time of the passing of the Law or only to those whose fathers were Persian subjects at the time of their birth. 4. If the former interpretation is adopted, then the children of Hazaras domiciled in Persia who are registered as Persian subjects will undoubtedly be claimed as Persian subjects also by the Persian authorities in spite of their Mrth on British soil. In view of the terms of para. 9(i) 0 f Chapter XXVI of the General Instructions to His Majesty's Consular Officers, it would appear to be inadvisable to giant British passports in such cases— especially at the present time when the Persian Government is particularly sensitive about any attempt to acquire foreign nationality which they attribute to a desire to avoid Persian law. As several applica tions from such persons are pending before me, I should be grateful to have your early instructions in the matter. 5.

Sir, I have the honour to report that there is in Meshed a community of some 50 or 60 families who are known as Kashmiris. 2* This community resides in a separate quarter of this town known as the Mohalla Kashmirian and have always been known and spoken of as Kashmiris. Many of them have been settled in Meshed for two or three generations but though they state that they are of Indian origin and came here from Kashmir, with one or two exceptions, they have not hitherto troubled to register themselves as British subjects. 3. The head of the community is an individual called Mohamed Ali. His grandfather came from Kashmir and settled in Meshed and the family have always been registered in this Consulate-General: Vs ^— he tells me that he can personally vouch for the fact that the other members of the community are of Kashmiri origin, and informs me that with few exceptions they have only married among themselves and have not taken Persian wives. 4. The Persian authorities have recently instituted a census in Meshed and it is owing to this that the question of their nationality has been raised and the entire community have now come to me and asked to be registered as British subjects. They state that they have failed to register in the past because bled them and in the event of their requiring it was given them informally by my predecessors. u Jaz m. 5 IRE This is cotreet. They were generally looked on as Indian : p 'i T v ■ U ULU uMj | subject^; and much laxity prevailed in respect of such matters min former times, when the Persian was less organised than it is at present, an* business was transacted in a more haphazard fashion. The que f tion of their nationality has, however, now been raised by the census ib is necessary to decide whether these individual are Indians and ought to he registered as British subjects* 5 . X have called upon th^ bo produce proof of nationality. As stated above, one or families have been regularly registered. Of the otb-^s none are able to state definitely whether they were bor T bn India or Persia. They state that their parents came to Mesh^b. as pilgrims and settled here. Borne were probably born in i^bia and came here as children; others were almost certainly born in Meshed. Some have given me the names of rdatichs who are residents in nombay and other places in India and i have written to Bombay to endeavour to ascertain whether their relatives can testify to their places of birth, in every case, however, the relatives have been unable to state definitely where the individuals resident in Meshed were born but have admitted relationship with them* To sum up I think there is no doubt that this community is of Kashmiri origin; they have always been known as Kashmiris and the one or two leaders of the community who have always been registered as British subjects testify to the fact, on the other hand they have hitherto failed to register and they have to all intents and purposes severed their connection with India, though a few of them occasionally go to India for purposes of trade. These visits however are purely temporary and they are definitely domiciled in keshed and none of them ever express the smallest intention of returning to mdia. m these circumstances, 1 am not prepared to record that they should he registered as British subjects with the exception of the one or two families who have always been registered, and i consider that the Government of India are fully entitled to divest themselves of all responsibility in respect of a community who have definitely left India and settled in a foreign country. The Persian authorities have never troubled them at all and they^, s 11 ,8 ^ ^ 4V ‘^1 S{ Jj., ■) jSTO'ijv lo , : 9193 ': • u aiK ^ puh!! have lived hitherto perfectly contentedly as part of the general population of Meshed and I see no reason to anticipate ' that th ® refuaal t0 them of British nationality will impose any hardship upon them. 7.

In some instances these Karramis are in possession of letters from the Givil, or discharge certificates from the Military Authorities, which support their statements that they are British Indian subjects. In such cases I have issued them with emergency certificates. In many cases however these Kurramis have no papers at all except a liahdari issued by the Afghan Government,which describes the holder as an Afghan subject. They state moreover that the Afghan Authorities in these instances have confiscated their Pilgrim passes issued to them by the Political Agent, Murrain. I beg leave to reauest that in future such natives of the Kurram, who proceed on pilgrimage to Persia and 'Iraq via i Afghanistan, may oe issued with an official paper from some competent authority which shall definitely state that the bearer | is a British Indian subject, to whose re-entry into India there is no objection. • ouch passes should bear the bearer*s photograph. It might be of assistance to such natives proceeding on pilgrimage via Afghanistan if it were explained to them,before starting, that there is a British Legation at Kabul which doubt less would help them on the production of adequate proof that they are British Indian subjects.
