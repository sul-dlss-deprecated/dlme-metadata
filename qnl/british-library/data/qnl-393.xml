As regards the two Companies above-mentioned,I made it a ’sine qua non* * that the funds of each Company should be lodged in the Bank,and not with one of the Directors as at first proposed,fcr there would he no ruarantee whatsoever in the event of the person wl&lt; Both fcfc* Companies agreed to lodge their funds in the Bank and the question of registration of the Companies and fees to be levied held up pending a decision of the laws under which they can be re gistered.! would suggest that registers for such companies should be kept at tbe Agency and fees on registration,etc,,be shared with the Shaikh’s Government equally,inasmuch as s holders will con sist of both British subjects and Bahrain subjects,and tbe necessa ry Ross are,ard wbat Is their interest in Bahrain.The question of with whom-funds,, were lodged bankrupt or embezzling tbe moneynecessary clerical work will be carried out by the Agency.The Shaikh will probably agree to this tis he has no efficient staff to deal with these matters.

It ould he easy to do this by FI nr- 1 e legislation, hut unless all %he shareholders of the Company ware British subjects it is doubtful if it would be operative, hu question arose in 19S2 of applying the Companies acts to the Persian; Coast and Islands with a view to registering &amp;ubsi:ii3d?yjQmpanies to the A.P.O.C. in this area in order to get Persian capital into the Company from sral 1 shareholders in Persia who eou 1 d not be expected to buy shares in the open London market and who in any case would be embarrased by difficulties of transfer of shares or sale or death etc. ^ * We referred the matter to India and the A.P.O.C. to their legal advisers but the whole galaxy of legal talent could not settle the matter, and I enclose a copy of two letters (No. 2564-673-Grenl, dated 17th ^ugust 19?2 and -d. 0. let ter dated 30th December 19 from Mr. Law to •Sir Arnold Wilson) which show the present state of the matter; the last mentioned letter has apparently proved too hard a nut for the A* P.Q,Company 1 s legal luminaries to crack.Mem orand tin * Reference your memorandura No. 72/43/v.o., dated February 1024.
