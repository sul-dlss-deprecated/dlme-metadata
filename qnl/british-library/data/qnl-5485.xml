Reference to previous correspondence : —To^eiy cffjta. ItWj- No k*&lt;7{f4/&lt;y/i3t« of&amp; tish Legation, 1WWV. § June 28th,1930* Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch So. 285 (qi^l (K4T86/17/234) of June 8th tranaaaitting the King’s Commission appointing Ma^or 3aly, to be ills Majesty’s Consul at Seistan. In duo course this Commission was forwarded to the Kintstry for Foreign Affairs with a request for the issue of an exequatur to Major Laly, but the Protocol Department professed the rase Ives unable to do so, o’&lt;dng to the fact that this document was made out for ^Seistan, Kain, juzdap the Sarhadd', arid the last-named district was unknown to the Persian Government. It was pointed out verbally to the i ini ©try for Foreign Affairs that the district in question must have been known in the past, since Major Daly’s predecessor had held a Eoyal Commission for the sarhadd without demur on the part of the Persian Government. But Major Daly’s Commission was neverthe less returned under cover of a note asking that the necessary corrections might be made in order that an exequatur might be issued. £• I thereupon addressed a further note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, returning the Commission and explaining that in the circumstances I was unable to make any amendments to &amp; document which had been copied fhe Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, 'M. P., 5 Phe Foreign Office.- 2 - oopied exactly from the previous incumbent*a Royal ^ommissioi and had been signed by His Hajeety; I had, however, taken note that the Sarhadd was no longer recogniaed by the Persian Govemaent as a governmental district, and steps would be taken to ensure that future Commissions issued to ?!&amp;jor l)aly t s successors should conform to whatever nomen clature the Persian Government preferred, with that end in view I requested the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to inform me of the term by Bhieh the former district of the Sarhadd was now known, and also to furnish me with a com plete list of the Persian administrative districts in order to avoid similar difficulties in future* fhio request was never complied with, but in due course I received a note enclosing an exequatur and explain ing that this had been issued in deference to my wishes and In tiew of the fact that the Royal Commission had already been made out when the question of the S&amp;rhadd was first raised* Such exequaturs are not normally translated, and by an unfortunate oversight it was not noticed, when transmitting this document to Seistan, that it had been made out for the district of seistan only* My attention was drawn to the omission by a telegram from Major ^aly reporting the refusal of the Governor-General of xhorasan to recognise him in the Kainat* I thereupon again addressed the l&amp;nistry for Forei^i Affairs with a request for the Issue of a fresh exequatur and the sending of advance telegraphic instructions to Khorasan pending its issue* I also reiterated ray former request for full details as to the-a- Persian attalniatrative areas in order to avoid similar aisuriderstandings in the future. As a result of further verbal discussions between the Oriental Secretary to this Le^ition raid the head of the Pcjrtoool Department, in the course of which it was ascertained incidently that the latter had not been aware that His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Duzdap was under the supervision of Major Daly, it transpired that the present eovernoeate of suzdap apparent ly Includes the whole frontier district to the east of that town and stretches as far south as the Baluchistan border, ms area tallies roughly with that of the Sarhadd ra marked on the only map possessed by this legation in which the .ijirhadd is shown at all. in a subsequent confirmatory memorandum the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that note was taken of the fact that Major Daly exercised supervision over His Majesty's Vice Consul at msdap, and that the necessary instructions having been sent to the Governor General of Khorasau to recognise Major Daly in the Kainat, there was no need to issue that officer with a fresh exequatur. i informed Major Daly of the purport of this note, and instructed him to apprize me without delay of any further difficulties he might experience in obtaining practical recognition in the various areas specified by his Royal Commission. •*. I’here, for the present, the matter rests, and I do not propose to broSi again the question of the issue of a fresh exequatur unless instructed by you to do so. ?he solution arrived at is admittedly far from ideal, but the whole question is somewhat obscure, and is further com plicated by the genuine ignorance ad incompetence of theC(sj ^nistr^i ?he head of tlie l^rotoool Department frankly admit• 4s almost total ignorance of Persian geography, €»nd on ay aide I can find no adequate account of how and when the term 'Sarhadd' came into use and vshat precisely it signifies. The word itself merely denotes 'frontier** or 'frontier inarches and it may well have been brou^it into use by the Indian officials on the other side of the border, or have been a local term discarded when the town of Duzdttp came into being. it would seem, therefore, better to replace it in future Royal Coramlssions by the phrase '!?own and Districts of Duzdap, iHr^awa and Khw&amp;sh'. 5. Apart from the question of the s&amp;rha&amp;d, it would evidently have been preferable to issue a fresh exequatur covering the districts of the K&amp;ln&amp;t and Duz&amp;ap; but having refused to consider the issue of a fresh commission on the ground that the original had been signed by His Majesty, it is diT lioult to press for the cancellation of an exequatur which has been signed by the Shah, and I therefore hope that the present arrangement will be found to work well enough in practice until a fresh appointment necessitates the issue of a fresh Commission. b. The last Persian note referred to concluded with a request for an exact specification of the Consular district of any consular Officer whose appointment may be notified to the Persian Government in future. I do not propose to comply with this request until the Persian Government on their side have furnished me with the details concerning administrative areas for which I have repeatedly asked, and in view of the incompetence of the authorities concerned I doubtn British Legation, Tehran, 13th May, ^6 His Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of tile FQ—aPT&amp;ngoaexTfc of the Seietan and Kertaan ooneul&amp;r diatrlots* A ^ ^ I V** \.J I iSoO \ Reference:— Foreign Office despatoh Ho.

Re-arrangement of the Sis tan and Kerman Consular districts. In reply to your letter No. P.8224/29, dated the 23rd January 1930, I am directed to say that the intention of the Government of India is that only the particular question of Dehaneh Baghi should be decided independently of the main issue, while a decision on the other subsidiary questions including that of the extension of the Duzdap Vice-Consular area might be deferred until the position regarding the future of the Duzdap Railway becomes clearer.present or not, it will be necessary in future as in wie pas^ to rely largely on agencies outside whatever Consular area is primarily concerned in theory. In the aosence therefore of any serious embarrassment under the existing arrangement, it would seem desirable to defer any change during the present uncertainty over the future of the Duzdap Railway, which is clearly an important factor in the case and afiects also the suggesoion to transfer the headquarters of the Sis tan Consulate to Ruzdap. It seems desirable that the two inter~dependent questions, tha- of the limits of the future Consular area and that of its head quarters, should be decided together* rn the meantime, to defer a decision a little longer would have the advantage of allowing further time for completion of the consolidation of Persian control in Persian Baluchistan and even possibly (though this is not likely) for a decision by the Persian Government them- selves on their own civil and military administrative boundaries* 3. Of the subsidiary questions raised in the correspondence only one, viz* that of the boundary of the Duzdap Vice Consulate, appears to call for a decision independently of the main issue* On this point the Government of India concur in the recommenda tion of his Majesty* s Consul, Kerman, that Dehaneh Baghi, which is admittedly within the Persian province of Kerman, should sti31 be regarded as within the Kerman Consular area, though for practical convenience the ielegraph Officer should deal direct with Kerman or Duzdap, according as the question is one affecting the Persian Government authorities at Kerman or not* 4* Copies of this letter are being sent to his Majesty*s Minister, Tehran, and his Majesty's Consuls at dis^an ano.

It will be seen that Mr. Gould's objections were based on the same arguments that I have adduced against the proposed Khusp Ling Barut boundary, namely that as long as the responsibility lies with the Governor-General,Kerman, H.M*s Consul Kerman is the person, who should act as the direct link, with the Governor-General. It is for this reason I have recommended that the Consular areas should followfollow the administrative boundary.

Sir, Consular representation in the Sarhad , I have the honour to refer to my despatch ho.62 of 21st August to the address of His Majesty’s minister at Tehran, a copy of wnich w-s forwarded to you under endorsement no.410, and to report that I was recently able to carry out a short tour to KhwashjBampur and iransheher* I was accompanied hy the General officer Commanding in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, who enabled me to see much that would have been impossible under ordinary circumstances. I attach a note on the journey and the routes followed. The time at riy disposal was limited aiui my primary object was to obtain first hand information of conditions and to ascertain whether our interests warranted recommendation of extension of our consular representation south of Duzdap. 1 was unable to discover that there were any British subjects engaged in trade at Bampur or Iransheher (Fahreh). Goods appeared to reach that locality via the small southern ports and judging from the fact that tea, su^arsugar and cigarettes were sold at prices approximately 50% lower than those ruling at Duzda^, such commodities had escaped customs duty. At Khwash, in the Sarhad, the sources oi supply were jouzda^ and Mirjawa and there were several shops run by British-Indian traders from iluadap. I understood they sent goods further south to uizak. Russian piece-_oods were displayed in some shops, notably in one owned by Idu Khan, i learnt that they were retailed at prices below those of English piece goods, in spite of the fact that they had to be carried by road from Meshed. Although the Russian piece goods are of somewhat inferior ^ualit^,it would not be possible to undersell British goods imported by rail to Mirjawa unless the trade were subsidised.There was also talk of Russian petrol being expected shortly at Khwash. It is known that the Soviet Consul, Sistan,has been m&amp;kin^ strenuous endeavours to induce traders at huzdap to take Russian goods into the Sarhud and Persian Baluchistan. It can scarcely be seriously thought that such goods can compete economically with British goods imported by rail and tne only inference which can be drawn is that the Soviet is desirous of opening up trade at any cost, possibly to serve as a pretext for extending their consular system further south. i aiu not of tue opinion that the volume of our trade in the Sarhad would justify the expense of maintaining a consular agent in that area at present. Unless the activities of the Russians, south of huzda^, make rapid headway 1 cannot think that we should derive any political advantage from an agent there. The General Officer Commanding informed me that he had conclusive evidence that the Russians were sending agents among the Sarhad tribes to foment trouble. He further volunteered t e opinion that we ought to have a representa tive at Khwash, with whom he could deal regarding matters onon the frontier, and who could frustrate Russian intrigues on our 'border. Whether this information was prompted hy genuine apjrenension of the outcome of Soviet i intrigues, or merely to convince me of his pro-British leanings, is difficult to determine. it would seeu* sufficient, for the time 'being,to watch Russian activities in the Sarhad as closely as p.-ssihle from huzdap and Sistan (the source). 7/ere we to extend our representation we might, 'by affording the Russi ans some justification for demanding e^ual facilities, 'bring about t^ie very situation we are anxious to avoid.

The route from Mirjawa to Khwash lies^ tnrough hilly country and is passable for heavy vehicles. Kosha was reached from the Khwash—Hazi 1 rocid, by a recently made motor track. The Khwash-Hazi1—Duzdap road branones xrom tne Mir jawa-Khwash road aboutjs miles nortu of Khwasn. Kosha is a small village on the slopes of Kuh-i- faftan. It has a good permanent water supply. The General Officer Cowmandin&amp; in Persian Baiucnistan has built a com fortable summer residence there, ihe climate is supe-i i..)x t^ that of Khwash• Water froze during the night of r// 16 th October. From Kosha tne party proceeded to Bampur via Khwash, in three cars, his Majesty’s Consul’s -uistxn touring car, tne General Officer Commanding’s haaerican tourer and a new Chevrolet Lorry. The American touring car was unequal to the strain of a long pull through the ihills on a surface of small, loose stones recently laid, and had to be abandoned. The other car and tne lorry completed the journey without otner difficulty than was occasioned by patches of heavy sand on tne SHURAS-B^ufPUK Section, from which tney had on several occasions to be extricated by the efforts of the escort of 15 men. The lorry was unable to make much pace after reaching the Bampur plain and consequently the night was spent in tne desert some forty miles short of Bampur. The motor road follows tne route described at page 326, Routes in Persia Yol. IV-Part I, with the exception that Jauri is reached from Khwash via Dola-ii instead of via Chan Gh&amp;ibi. Thence after leaving tne hills ofr * i 01 tne Sarhad via the Jauri valley the road descends to the Baaipur plain and follows a line pa^rallel to tne old camel roiue via 3HUHAB-BAZHAII-KhSHIN to a point midway between Ir&amp;nshahx (Old Fejuraj or Far eh.) where it joins the road connecting Bampur with Xranshanr. From Khwas^* until the B^npur plain is reached the road has been fairly well repaired ana is passable for heavy lorries, although there are some steep ascents.The supply of water at DOIhh.I, presumably at its lowest after the not weather was sufficient for a Brigade of troops,but was much fouled by animals. The stream in the Jauri ITala was dry, but I was informed there were water holes at some distance from tne motor road. There was very little water in the two wells at ShYAB. The supply could probably be increased by clearing the wells but it is doubtful if more than 6-8 camels could be watered per hour, t^e fioy* into ine wells Dein^ ver^ slow. The water was very salty. Both quantity ana quality much improve after rains begin in the hills. From 3iY.au to BAhPUK the road nowhere passes within easy reach ox water and for drinking purposes and for radiators of cars it wuuld have to be carried, h supply would be available in pools in the KASKTIT Rudkhaneh aft ex- rains had started in the hills, but at the time ox’ the tour txie Rudkhaneh was quite dry. On this section (Suurab-Bampur) txxe road follows txxe centre of hie plao.n wmereas tue ca^el route skirts the hills on tne east of the plain,consequently no traffic wixatever is met. The Kerman-Bam-Rigan tr ick meets the motor road s.lxOx tly ax ter i t reaches tne plain some 8 —• 10 miles nox-th of the Shux'ab. I was inf or ed by the General Officer Commanding that this route was impassable fox* motor traf f x c. he once accomplished a journey cy it eax'xy txxis ye ax', but had very great difficulty in getting through in a liqxxt car and it had much deteriorated sx/iee. From a hill top near Jauri the ca^p of the telegraph construction party was seen near Karvunda which party 'Yas erecting the line from Tr hv/asli to Iranshahr.The Gergerux Offroer. .Officer Commanding contemplated constructing a more direct motor road from Khwash along the camel track via Karvandar and Damin. The outstanding feature at .aampur is the fort, previously occupied by Dost Eohamed, and now garrisoned by a detachment of troops from Iranshahr. It is on a hill commanding the plaint, very strongly built of dried mud, the walls being several yards thick* It covers a considerable area and has both an outer and inner wall and a strong tower on the summit of the hill. barracks have been recently built inside the fort and the detachment appeared to consist of some 50 men under an officer. Communication with the headquarters at Iranshahr was by Kelio* The village at present does not consist of more than 100-150 reed huts. I was told that the population was some 2,000 persons before the military occupation. They had fled on the approach of troops and were only just returning with a view to resuming cultivation. There was however a great shortage of seed grain and although the General Officer Commanding had represented to the Cent/ral Government the necessity of supplying seed, both for political reasons and in order that the garrison might obtain supplies locally next year, he had not so far been able to obtain any from the Government granary at Sistan *&lt;ater was abundant all along the cultivated area stretching from Dampur to Iranshahr. Fuel exists in plenty and in normal years supplies of grain, meat, .Bhusa etc would be ample for a large force. Iranshahr (Fehruj or Fareh) is the headquarters of the troops in baluchistan. On occupying this area the Persians found a very large cuilding which had been the •palace 1 of the Governor of Baluchistan in the time of hadir Shah. It has been put into thorough repair. All materials for -which, such as doors, windows, cement etc. was transported from Duzdap, an achievement which can only be fully iealisea after the •road* ^ has been seen. TheThe building covers several acres and is planned on a fine scale with wide avenues containing running water, tanks and fountains. The whole is surrounded by a wall of immense thickness. The buildings within this peri meter consist of barracks capable of accommodating a brigade. Officers* quarters, hospital with enclosed courtyardlhaving a domed roof of considerable architechtural beauty, stabling for 80-100 horses, large ambars originally used for the storage of the Revenue grain of the province, a large •Hamam* and many lesser buildings. Communication with the brigade Headquarters at Khwash was by wireless. A concert wireless apparatus in the Officers* Mess received programmes from Bombay and Baku. The baluch village in the vicinity of the fort is small, as the Baluchis distrust the troops, but a large number of scattered settlements could be seen for several miles. besides a fast running stream about 4 feet wide which traverses the fort, there is a reserve supply of water from wells. The climate of Bampur and Iranshahr at the end of October was damp and decidedly hot. A small hill near the fort is known as Tel Frangi, so named apparently because a European geologist pitched his tent there some thirty years ago. I was informed that no European was believed to have visited Bampur or Iranshahr since that time. The return journey from iranshahr to Khwash was made in one day-time taken 15 hours. The Chevrolet lorry took 18 hours. Khwash has a population of about 2,000* it has been considerably improved since the military occupation and boasts a school, barracks and a hospital. The General Officer Commanding cherishes a plan for electric lights to be carried out by the Municipality. Time did not admit of a visit to Dizak, but HisHis Majesty^ Consul was informed that the road was for Persia, excellent and passable for heavy lorries* ihe driver of a Chevrolet who was met on his return from there, confirmed this information- The return to Duzdap from Khwash was made by His Majesty's Consul via Taj in (Pujjing - see map of the Sarhad - Simla Drawing Office Ho*718 of October 1924} NAZIL-DiSHAX. The section of the road between Taj in and Hazil is very rough, owing to large, loose stones in countless small nullahs. This however offers no serious obstruc tion and heavy lorries could traverse the section with very little labour. ,vater was abundant at Isazil and Dehak. Prom the latter place to Duzdap the road has been levelled recently, the surface is naturally good and it was possible to maintain a uniform speed of 40 miles per hour. The Mirjawa-Khwash road is passable throughout for heavy lorries, with the possible exception of a short section near Ladie. H4^hter this, nor the Hazil-Duzdap route would be passable very shortly after rain. Chevrolet lorries ply regularly between Khwash and Mirjawa and frequently take military supplies to nakshan, near Dizak. Supplies are sent for the troops at iranshahr by lorry, but the owners, of hired lorries have increased the rate of hire, owing to the heavy wear and tear occasioned by the Shurab-iranshahr section, to such an extent that the Military Department has sanctioned the purchase of lorries for this work. The General Officer Commanding estimated that the life of his lorries-would not exceed six trips to Dampur and back ed.

I have the honour to address you in continuation of my despatch No. 45 of June 23rd, 1929, and with reference to the views expressed thereon by H. M.’s Consul, Kerman, in his despatch No. 48-646, dated 24th July 1929. I cannot trace that the boundaries of the Sarhad have been at any time definitely determined. I presume they are as shewn on Map No. a718, a tracing of which is attached to this report. In this connection however I would draw attention to page 2 of the report on the Sarhad by Major W. G. Hutchinson, Political Officer in the Sarhad with General Dyer’s force. The northern boundary is therein stated to run in “a straight line from Dehani-Baghi to Koh-i-Malik Siah I draw attention to this because in the map, Dehani-Baghi would appear to be outside the Sarhad. In this connec tion’please see Mr. Law’s despatch from Kerman Consulate, No. 794, dated 9th September 1925, in which he points out that Dehani-Baghi (where a telegraph office exists manned by British subjects) is within 4 hours of Duzdap, while it is some days difficult journey from Kerman. In practice this Consulate is always referred to in matters concerning the tele graph personnel at Dehani-Baghi and the telegraph officer there superintends the officers at Duzdap and Sistan, and the line Duzdap-Sistan. I should be glad therefore of instructions as to whether Dehani-Baghi is to be considered within this Consular area or that of Kerman. The views advanced in my despatch No. 45 apply in particular to the area of Persian Baluchistan, comprising Dizak and Bampur, which country I proposed to visit in September, as was intended by my predecessor, vide Sistan despatch No. 33, dated 13th January 1929 (copy forwarded to H. M.’s Minister under No. 3 of 1929) and with the same objects as outlined by Mr. Skrine in the above-mentioned despatch. This area is at present included in Kerman Consulate, although in practice it can only be effectively watched from Duzdap. Bampur is now connected with Duzdap by a good motor road. In his despatch No. 794 of 1925 from Kerman Consulate, H. M’s Consul pointed out that this area was even more inaccessible to Kerman than the Sarhad proper. I submit that were we, as suggested by Major Noel in his No. 48/646 of 1929, to await for some permanent scheme to be evolved by the Persians, the matter may quite likely be postponed indefinitely. The administration of Baluchistan will apparently continue to be in the hands of the Persian military authorities and army affairs in Persia are in a state of flux, commands being changed and reformed to meet the exigencies of the moment. Even if the Military Governor in Baluch istan should eventually be under a superior officer at Kerman, it will only be possible to dealfivith any business at Dizak or Bampur through H. M.’s Vice Consul, Duzdap. i \ ENCL©SURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter Dated No / 4 NOV. 1S2d M Received O ^ n 1 tJ k. *3 if # ( 22 ) Endorsement from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, ^so. 8&lt;,9, DATED THE 12TH SEPTEMBER 1929. Copy forwarded to— The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, Sistan, for information. Despatch No. 64-837, dated the 12th September 1929 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Subject :—Superintendence of Persian Baluchistan. Enclo. to Serial No. 22. Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 64-837, dated the 12th September 1929. I have the honour to address you with reference to His Majesty's Consul, Sistan, despatch No. 62 of August 21st, 1929. As regards Dehani-Baghi I admit that from the geographical point of view it would be much more convenient if it were included in the Sistan Consular area, and I would be quite prepared to see it handed over if I could at the same time be certain of being divested of all work and respon sibility in regard to it. I am afraid, however, that under present circum stances a number of questions arising in connection with Dehani-Baghi sub-division must necessarily continue to be dealt with by this Consulate. It is situated in the district of Narmashir which forms a deputy governor ship under Kerman. The Amnieh guards stationed there are appointed and paid from Kerman. I find that there is a file in this Consulate dealing continuously with the question of these guards for the last 5 years and already running to over 200 pages. Only last week the Assistant Superinten dent telegraphed that the guards had been fined so heavily that they were likely to desert. Now that official relations with the Persian departments is forbidden private steps had to be taken to get the fine remitted. Again the Assistant Superintendent, Dehani-Baghi is in charge of the telegraph line up to Bam and damage on this section in accordance with the 1872 Telegraph Convention has to be reported to the Deputy Governor of Narmashir who is under Kerman. I see little object in using His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate, Duzdap as a post office for forwarding matters to His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman which have so far been dealt with direct between here and the Assistant Superintendent, Dehani-Baghi. As far as I am aware the present arrangements have worked well in practice and I would therefore suggest that they be allowed to stand, i. e., that the Telegraph Officer should deal direct with either Kerman or Duzdap as he has been doing to date. As regards handing over the Bampur and Dizak areas, I would point out that the position has changed considerably since Mr. Law expressed the views quoted by His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan. It is now possible to motor from Kerman to Bampur and His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan reports {vide Sistan Diary for period July 1st to August 15th, 1929, paragraph 65) that all available money is being spent on improving this road. Bampur will thus be as accessible to Kerman as it is to Sistan. However a more important point would seem to be in connection with the appointment of a Consular Agent at Bam, a question which has had a consecutive history since 1903. It was last raised by my predecessor, the late Mr. Davies in January and you stated that you were fully inGIPD ~388's)F&amp;PD—9-ll*29—7. agreement with the ultimate necessity of the appointment. Now a British Vice-Consul was actually appointed to Bam in 1904 and again in 1914 and on each occasion he was under Kerman and his jurisdiction embraced Bampur. My predecessor has pointed out {vide Despatch 10/74 of 17th January 1929) that Kerman and not Duzdap or Sistan is the natural market for the wool and ghee of Baluchistan, and that in exchange the Baluchis will take henna from Bam, rice and other foodstuffs from Jiruft and various foreign commodities from Kerman. I consider that in any revision of the jurisdiction of the Kerman Consulate vis a vis Sistan the question of the Bam appointment should be given due consideration. I am forwarding copies of this Despatch to the Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Department, India, and to His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan.(23) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 234, dated the 21st September 1929. His Britannic Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned below on the subject of the Consular districts of Kerman and Sistan. To the Foreign Office, London, No. 489 of the 21st September 1929. Enclo. to Serial No. 23. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the London Foreign Office, No. 489, dated the 21st September 1929. I have the honour to refer to my depatch No. 367 of July 9th on the subject of the appointment of a Consular representative in Persian Balu chistan. Intimately bound up with this question is that of the re-arrange ment of the Consular districts in South-Eastern Persii, a matter which has formed the subject of considerable correspondence between the Consular officers involved and the Government of India. 2. The question of transferring the districts of Dizak and Bampur from the superintendence of the Consul at Kerman to that of the Consul at Sistan was first mooted some years ago, no action being taken as it was felt desirable to await the subjection by the Persian Government of Dost Mohamed and the probable consequent re-arrangement of the Persian administration. The Persian operations last winter seemed to have resulted in the pacification of this area but no steps appear to have yet been taken in regard to the re-arrangement of the administration, nor do enquiries at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs elicit any sign of an approaching decision on this subject. 3. It is undoubtedly true that the areas in question are more easilv reached and controlled from Sistan than from Kerman and I am for that reason inclined to recommend that they should be transferred to the former Consular district. In this event the boundary between the Kerman and Sistan Consu lar districts might, I am advised, most conveniently be considered as a line from Khusp to Ling Barut (both included in the Sistan area as too the Ismailzai district), thence following the western boundary of the Bampur district to Fanuch and Bint in the Lashar hills, both falling into the Sistan area, as being politically and geographically connected with Bampur and Sarbaz. The boundary would be through Ling Barut, Kalanzau, Fanuch, Bint, whence it might follow the Rapch river to the coast at Calag. There remains the question of the small strip of territory running from the west of Calag to Jask bounded on the north by the Bashakard district of the Kerman province and known as the Jask sub-district of Persian Mekran. There appear to be good reasons for including this small area in either district and I offer no opinion on this point. 4. In the event of the above proposals being adopted the limits of the Duzdap Vice-Consular area might be extended to include Persian Baluchistan being bounded on the North and North-West by a line running Koh-i-Malik- Siah, Dehan-i-Baghi—Nasratabad Sipi, Ling Barut, and thence to the coast as may be decided. The eastern boundary would coincide with the Persian frontier. 5. In this connection there is the further question which has been discussed from time to time in recent years, of the desirability or otherwise of moving the headquarters of His Majesty’s Consul at Sistan and Kain from Sistan to Duzdap leaving if necessary a Vice-Consul at Sistan. In view ofthe large extension southwards of the area in which he will be responsible if the present proposals are approved, the suggestion has much to recommend it more especially as the existence of the railway makes it almost certain that the town of Duzdap will continue to grow in usportance. I am not in a position to judge of the expense of such a move which w'ould probably be considerable. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India, and to His Majesty's Consular officers at Sistan and Kerman. Ol.

With reference to Foreign and Political Department endorsement No. F. 82-N/29, dated the 11 th September 1929, I have the honour to sub mit the following observations on despatch No. 45 , dated the 23rd June 1929, from His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain to His Majesty’s Minister, at Tehran. 2 . In regard to the proposal of His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman for the appointment of a British Consular or Trade Agent at Bam, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has expressed the view, in which I concurred— vide correspondence ending with my letter No. 269-S., dated the 13th July 1929,— that there was no great urgency from either the political or the commercial point of view, in proceeding with the proposal. 3. In his despatch No. 48/648, dated the 24th July 1929, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (copy forwarded to the Government of India under his endorsement of same date) His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman has furnished certain arguments against the proposal to extend the jurisdiction of His ^ Majesty's Vice-Consul at Duzdap as suggested by His Majesty’s Consul at Sfstan. The following additional arguments suggest themselves. 4. Even if Jask and Charbar are subordinated to the Eastern Command with headquarters in the Duzdap Area, reference to Duzdap would only be necessary in military matters. For civil purposes, the former place is subor dinate to Bandar Abbas and Bushire, and the latter to Bushire and in the majority of cases, in the future as in the past, reference will have to be made to the authorities at those places. 5. The instance of a reference to Duzdap quoted by His Majesty’s Consul at Sistan was in regard to a British military aeroplane, which had to be dealt with by the military authorities. In several instances—the most recent of them being in connection with the burning of the Imperial Airways liner “City of Jerusalem” at Jask—reference had to be made to the authorities at Bushire or Bandar Abbas. Moreover when Persian Baluchistan is more settled military administration will tend to yield to civil, and in any case the continuance of a system whereby Mohammerah falls under one Command, Bushire to Lingah under a second, Bandar Abbas under a third and Jask and Charbar under a fourth, is unlikely. His Excellency the Governor of the Gulf Ports informs me that the transfer of Jask and Charbar from his jurisdiction is not under contempla tion. ^ 6 . As regards the collection of intelligence, while His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Duzdap is in a better position as regards the interior, the Director Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, is in a more favourable position to gather intelligence from the Coastal area, especially as regards the most important items, the Arms and Slave traffic. The Officers of the Telegraph Department have no official status vis-a-vis the Persian Government, but their residence at the ports and the nature of their duties gives them facilities for acquiring most useful information. 7. Finally in matters naval, it is very desirable that the Senior Naval Officers references in regard to the whole of the coast should be made to the Political Resident and not to Consuls living in the interior with whom he cannot be in personal touch.GIFD~388(s) F&amp;PD—8-11-29—7i (25) Endorsement from His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 458, DATED THE 28TH SEPTEMBER 1929.

I have the honour to refer to Kerman Consulate despatch No. 64/837 ^ v a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of India under endorse ment No. 840 of 12 th September 1929. I have personally no dasire what ever to incur the additional responsibility which would result from the inclusion of Persian Baluchistan in the Sistan Consulate area, provided that His Majesty’s Consul Kerman is satisfied that he can now adequately supervise that province. I would however point out that control of affairs in Baluchistan is vested in the Persian Military commander whose head quarters are at Khwash, in the Sarhad. I recently met this officer and discussed with him the possible future military arrangements. He told me that he still hoped to be given an independent command which would, even if it included Kerman, still have headquarters at Khwash which had definitely been decided on as the most important strategic centre. During the course of the conversation the G. 0. C. quite spontaneously advanced the opinion that a British representative was badly needed at Khwash, which was expanding as a result of the Persian occupation. I had intended, with the approval of the G. 0. C., to tour in that area, but the arrival of a Military Commission from Tehran to report on the administration by the G. O. C. of the Sarhad and Baluchistan made the moment inopportune, and he has asked me to defer my visit until the middle of October when the commission will have departed. Whatever decision may be arrived at as regards Consular jurisdiction in Baluchistan, I would submit that it would now be advantageous at least to have the boundary between Sistan and Kerman Consulates definitely determined. Dehani Baghi is included in the Sarhad according to Major Hutchinson’s report and in the map which accompanied it. It would also seem advisable for a definite area to be determined upon for the Duzdap Vice-Consulate, which at present is confined to the Town of Duzdap and the railway to Mirjawa.

The line of demarcation suggested, viz., Khusp Ling Baruts cuts across the Kerman province and places under the jurisdiction of His Majesty’s Consul Sistan areas which are directly administered from Kerman and have nothing to do with Sistan. The arrangement if sanctioned cannot be satis factory. As a practical example I would quote the present telegraphic correspondence with the Assistant Superintendent Dehaneh Baghi in regard to an escort for his impending tour and a guard for his wife and family during his absence. It would seem to me very necessary that in any redistri bution of the Kerman and Sistan Cousular areas the existing administrative borders should be followed and not an imaginary line which cuts the Kerman province arbitrarily in two. I would therefore suggest as an alternative that the boundary on the East should be that of the district of Bam Narmashir which is a Deputy Governorship under Kerman. For all practical purposes the matter resolves itself into one of robberies of British goods, protection of telegraph line and the telegraph staff. It would srmi essential that all areas in which the Amnieh and Governorship is centered at Kerman should remain in the jurisdiction of His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman.GIPD —388(s)F&amp;PD—8»ll-29—7. r' Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Ko. 250, dated the 15th October 1929.

Enclosure I. Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 48/046 of 1929. dated 24th July 1929. 1 have the honour to address you regarding the proposal to transfer from the jurisdiction of His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate, Kerman to that of Sistan, the district of Persian Baluchistan, which has been advocated in Sistan despatch No. 45 of June 23rd, 1929. The same proposal was made in 1925 when it was agreed to leave it unsettled until the Persian Government decided on their administrative areas and made an effective military occupation. These considerations would still appear to hold good: the area of the Persian Baluchistan command is still undecided [vide para graph 190 (2) of Duzdap Diary for the fortnight ending July 7th, 1929]. Tim effective military occupation of the country to the South of Bampur has yet to be undertaken. If as reported by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Duzdab the Persian Baluchistan command is to be separated from Meshed and amalgamated with Kerman it is more than likely that the Officer Commanding will make Kerman his headquarters for a larger period of the year. In this case His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan’s arguments in favour of superintendence over Persian Baluchistan being transferred to Sistan will apply with even greater force to the retention of the existing arrangements of superintendence from Kerman. My predecessor, the late Mr. Davies, strongly advocated the appointment of a Consular Agent at Bam in his Despatch No. 10/74 of January 17th, 1929, and you agreed as to the ultimate necessity of an appointment of this nature. His Majes' y’ Consul, Sistan now recommends the creation of a similar appointment at Bampur under his control. There is presumably no room for both. The Bam appoint ment for the reasons given on page 2 of Mr. Davies’ above quoted despatch can be supported on commercial grounds, which in your Despatch No. 7 of April 26th you indicated as being the ones on which the proposal has to be justified. His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan, has given much importance to the recent incident when permission for an aeroplane to land at Jask had to be sought through the Vice-Consul at Duzdab. On the other hand, for one such incident there are nume rous occasions on which questions regarding passports, customs, etc., arising on the Persian Mekran Coast are referred to Bandar Abbas. When I was at Bandar Abbas last month an employee of Imperial Airways stationed at Jask wished to leave for Karachi by the next air liner due in 36 hours. The necessary permission was obtained through His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas from the Persian authorities at that port. If Jask had been within the jurisdic tion of His Majesty’s Consul Sistan it would still have been necessary to refer the matter to Bandar Abbas. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan. ^ . : . : « I UtEnclosure II.

During conversation he told me that although the Sarhadis are still afraid o the Persians but he hopes to keep them quiet and that they will not make any disturbance. About the construction of roads in Persian Baluchistan, he said that he is very anxious for making a road between Bampur and Chahbar, but at present he has not sufficient funds at his disposal. He said that the Government had sanctioned altogether 50,000 Tomans for this purpose out of winch now only 20,000 Tomans are left and this amount he wants to spend on the repairs of Ker- man-Bampur road, which, he said, is in a bad condition. That on completion ot this r pad, he will report to Tehran and ask them to sanction further amount tor Chahbar-Bampur road.

It is not yet known whether the troops in Sistan will be under the Bais-i-Tin or remain attached to the Eastern Command. ^ MC443FD—7—5-9-20—GIPSbir, I have the honour to address you regarding .British representation in Persian Baluchistan and the re-adjustment of Consular areas involved. Consideration has already Been given to the matter of extension of our representation in the above-mentioned province, vide despatch Bo. 10/74 dated 17th January 1929 from H.M 1 s Consul, Kerman, in which cogent reasons were advanced for the appointment of a Consular Agent at Bam. This despatch is doubtless under consideration, but I would submit that a decision on the subject of increased representa tion in Persian Baluchistan might be arrived at after the main question of Consular jurisdiction in that area has been accorded full consideration. Hitherto Persian Baluchistan has been included in the 1 sphere of the Kerman Consulate. This arrangement dates from a period antecedent to the establishment of a vice Consulate at Buzdap when Baluchistan was perhaps slightly more accessi ble to Kerman than to oistan. i^oreover Persian Baluchistan was at that time nominally within the jurisdiction of the Governor-beneral at Kerman. Circumstances have now completelyi changed and the nominal control of the Governor General has given place to the effective occupation and administration of f the province by the military authorities of a section of the Persian Eastern Army based on Khwash, Dizak and Bampur. In his despatch Bo.724 dated 9th September 1925, mi* . Law, C.I.E., I.C.S., then Consul at Kerman, drew attention to the fact that tne barhad area was most inaccessible to Kerman and proposed transference of Consular jurisdiction to the bistan Consulate. wir. Lav/ reserved pro-tem the question /question of similarly transferring jurisdiction in Persian Mekran and the Barapur and Dizak districts, but pointed out that these areas were even more inaccessible to Jierm&amp;n than the Sarhad proper, bince Mr. Law’s despatch which formed the subject matter of B.M*s Minister’s despatch Ho.581 of October 30th, 1925 to the Secretary of State, the events of 1928 have brought the whole area of the Sarhad, Lizak and Bampur under the effective control of the Central Government, and Persian mekran is being slowly but surely penetrated and brought under the Central Administration. A decision on Consular jurisdiction in the v.hole of Persian Baluchistan would seem to be called for now. In practice this Consulate has for some years been the medium for watching and reporting on the area referred to and throughout the operations in Baluchistan, which culminated in the subjugation of the provinces by force of arms, all negotiations with the military authorities directing the operations were conducted by this Consulate, while in October 1928 n.M’s Minister in his despatch Ho. 26 dated 25 th October informed h.m’s Consul, Sistan that'll .M’s Consul, Kerman, has pointed out that you have greater facilities for obtaining- the required information from the districts of the Sarhad, Lizak and Bampur”. Further, when a British aeroplane quite recently was detained at Jask, the local authorities referred for oraers to the military commander at Khwash. Fortunately the machine was permitted to proceed after a short delay, but had protracted negotiations become necessary it would have been this Consulate, through the Vice Consulate at buzdap, which could alone have been in touch with the Persian authorities concerned, as it was, much duplication of telegrams and consequent confusion result ed» I would therefore propose that the geographical boundaries of the merman and Sistan Consulates should nowbe defined- in a manner consonant with the situation actually existing• I concur generally with on:. Law’s proposal ivide his despatch ho# 794^ and would suggest that the boundary might most conveniently be considered as a line from xlHUSP to .Ling BAHUT iboth included in the bis tan area] and thence so as to include in Sistan Consulate the IZMAILZAI country and following the western boundary of the BAMPUR district to PAMJCH and BINT in the LASHAR HILLS, which should both fall within the Sistan area, since both are politically and geographically connected with BAMPUR and SARBAZ. This would make the boundary LING-BARUT - AALANZAU- FAMJCH - BINT. Thence it might conveniently follow the RAPCH river to the coast at GALAG* It will be noticed that the area which would be thus included under the bistan Consulate almost entirely coincides with the area included in the province of Persian Baluchistan, with the exception of the TASK Sub-district of Persian MEKRAN - a small strip of territory running from the west of GALAG to JASK and bounded on the north by the BASHAAARI) district of trie KERMAN province. If it be considered desirable that as far as possible H.M*s Representative’s area should coincide with the Persian Administrative area this district of JASK should similarly be included under the Sistan Consulate. it is conceivable that JASK, being now an airport, will increasing ly require our attention, and since the Persian officials there take orders from the military authorities at KHWASH or LIZAK who would be accessible to this Consulate through H.u’s Vice Consulate at Luzdap, it may be considered advisable to include JASK, thus bringing the whole of province of Persian Baluchistan within the Sistan Consular limits.The Persian Mekran Coast is watched at present for intelligence purposes, h/ the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Karachi, acting under the orders of the Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since the occupation of Daluchistan and Mekran h/ the Persian forces is now An established fact, and t ie consti action oi a motor road between CHAHBAR and BAilPUR (tae latter is alread/ so connected with Duzdap) is believed to be contemplated, it seems prooable that administrative control of this district will continue to be invested in the military commander at iihwash, with whom as already pointed out, contact can only be maintained through the Duzdap Vice Consulate• Should my suggestions be approved, it would remain to define the limits of the Duzdap Vice Consular area. At present this is confined to the town of Duzdap and the territory contiguous to the railway as far as mirjawa• In practice this Consulate has to keep in touch through the Vice Consul, Duzdap, with the Persian Commander at Khwash, to whom the junior military Governor at Duzdap is subordinate. I would therefore propose that the Vice Consular area should be extended to include Persian Baluchistan, being bounded on the north and north-west by a line running KSH-I-MAxiliC SIAM - DAMAN-I-BAGHI -BASRATABAD SIP I - LING BARUT and thence to the coast as may be decided. The eastern boundary would coincide with the boundary between Persian Baluchistan and British Baluchistan and Persian Mekran and British mekran. While the above proposals are under consideration the permanency or otherwise of the Duzdap Vice Consulate might advantageously be decided. A decision on this matter has been postponed from time to time pending negotiations regarding the future of the railway. The occupation of Persian Baluchistan by the Central Government has so far altered the situation that, even should the section of the railwayrailway on Persian soil 'be removed in the future, tne for a \fice Consulate so ms where in tnat ea, will still exist, although its removal to hhwash, Pizak or Bampur might have to be considered, should Puzdap cease to be an important centre. There can be little doubt that in the event of the removal or withdrawal of rail-head to within British territory, the Persians would concentrate on Chahbar as a port of entry,for Eastern Persia. In this event we may anticipate that the .Russians, hitherto precluded from trading extensively south of Birjand, owing to transport difficulties, would endeavour to compete further south by ocean-borne trade via Chahbar. On tne grounds of such trade they might conceivably press for representation in that area, an event which owing to the proximity to British territory might become inconvenient. ine Russian Consulate at Sistan is now re-newing activities in the direction ol Buzdap and Persian Baluchistan and is known to have established intelligence agents there. Their activities can only be w r atched and checked by adequate representation in Baluchistan, and it would appear necessary, for reasons already advanced by b.M* s Consul, Kerman in respect of Bam, that a Consular Agent should be appointed somewhere in the KhYi/ash-Bampur-Bizak area* 1 would deter any concrete proposal/ as to the place at which tne headquarters Oi such an agent should be, until the general policy has been considered, and a decision arrived at, as to whetner Baluchistan is to be included within the Sistan Consulate. Should this be determined upon, 1 would propose to visit the Dizak and Bampur districts later in the year. In the event of the uuzdap Vice consulate jurisdic tion being extended to include Persian Baluchistan as proposed, and in consideration of the fact that it will presumably7 presumably continue to be necessary to appoint a British official as H.M’s Vice Consul, who will have to negotiate with senior military commanders (Governors), I would suggest that s Vice Consul, Duzdap, might be given the personal rank of Consul within the Vice Consulate area, as is the case at H.M’s Vice Consulate Bandar-Abbas. This would in no way affect the emoluments of the incumbent or the subordination of the Vice Consulate to H.M’s Consulate, Sistan. It would however give H.M’s representative a better standing with the Persian officials with whom he will have to deal.

This being so, it would seem prudent before seeking to revive our previous representation in this area to await the anticipated materialiaation of the fcuesian Vice-Consulate, which would if desired provide the reason and the excuse for our action.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. 1 r NS- Dated 21 FEB. 1929 Received ^ | MAR. 1923Confidential no. 10/74 of 1929. nis Britannic i.aajesty*s Consulate, .Herman, 17til January 1929. /» SeCftrCsj [ ll$J ilcc slw&amp;) r* * af^r+r a Sir, i iiave the honour to addresji you regarding the information ♦ given in parag raph 296 of rny hiary for December that the Kussians intend to appoint a trade agent at ham. The informa tion was given to me confidentially by his Excellency the Governor General who had it on very good authority, and there is every reason to believe that it is correct. 1 2. it is unnecessary to emphasise that the object of the Kussians is politics rather than trade. Their trade with ham is at present negligible nor is it a natur^ centre for Russian trade either in imports or exports, it is true that an important product of that district is henna, a considerable proportion of which used in past years to be exported to Russia, hut this trade is nearly all in the hands of iezdis who have agents in ham and the export trade is controlled from Yezd; so that if henna is their excuse Yezd would be a better centre. 3. The Rais-i-Malieh has informed ikx me that the Governmeitt have sanctioned a sum of Tunans 25,000 for the making of roads between hampur and ham and Duzdab. There is only one pass bet ween ham and hampur and the construction of a motor road with the money at the Governraent* s disposal is quite feasible. 1 understand a telegraph line from Mirjawa to hampur is already under construction and there is also talk of the construction of a telegram line from ham. if order is restored in haluchistan and communications with ham are improved the opportunity open to a Russian trade agent in Bam, if left to his own devices, for H.M*s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. Tofor extended political intrigue in Ualuchistan is obvious, and the danger of such intrigues to British interests needs no em phasis. 4. The time therefore appears to have come to reconsider the question of appointing a British Consular Agent in Bam or Bampur. Bor convenience of reference 1 attach a liemorandum giving a his tory of this question as far as information is available in this office. One fact clearly emerges from the records viz that ever since the proposal was first mooted in 1903 all the authori ties concerned have throughout realized the importance of having a Consular Agent or Vice-Consul in Bam or Bampur, and it was only on account of the unsettled nature of political and commer cial conditions that the appointment was allowed to lapse after 1907 and was not revived in 1919. The long expected improve ment however appears at last to have come and there is every prospect that Bam will now gradually become a comparatively important trade centre. Kerman, and not Duzdab or Sistan is, l venture to think, the natural market for the wool and ghee of Baluchistan. In exchange the Baluchis will be able to take henna from Bam, rice and other foodstuffs from Jiruft and various foreign commodities from Kerman which it would not at first pay to import direct to Bampur. in course of time however and with the improvement of conditions generally, there is every likelihood that foreign trade direct to Bampur and Bam will develop. There are already two Hindu shopkeepers in Bampur and it is very probable that more will be attracted to that dis trict and to Jiruft aa settled conyiditions become established, nor I suggest, would it be wise to leave the more problematical future entirely out of account. The emphasis which Hr. New comen laid on the possibilities of cotton in Bam (page 53 of the Keport of his Commercial Mission published by the Government of India in 1906), was apparently due to the tightness of the cotton market at the time and I agree with Lieut. Ogilivie*s opinion, expressed in 1906, that there is little likelihood of the Bamis taking this matter up. In other respects however i think Mr. 1! ewe omen 1 swau for the Vice-Consul at Barapur who will in all probability be eventually required to safeguard our interests in theBe parts, i understand that the appointment of Vice-Consul Bam, to which the Persian Government gave their consent, has never been offi cially abolished, and, as the greater includes the less, it does not appear that the Persian Government could reasonably refuse to agree to the appointment of a Consular Agent. If the right we formerly enjoyed by consent of the Persian Government, is regarded as having lapsed through disuse, and a case has to be made out de novo, I trust that the reasons given above for proposing the appointment are sufficiently strong to convince the Persian Government. The appointment of a British Consular Agent at Bam is a more natural and reasonable appointment than the appointment of a Russian Consul to Sis tan or a Russian Consular Agent to Birjand both of which appointments have been recognized by the Persian Government. Even if the Russians intend to appoint a Trade Agent in Bam without the recognition of the Persian Govern ment, (I understand this has hEX not yet been accorded or possibly not even asked forj the request for recognition of a British Consular Agent at Bam would still appear to be reasonable. 8. In conclusion 1 venture to suggest that an early decision on this question is highly desirable lest Russia forestall us in filling the political void created by the new conditions in Balu chistan. in principle Should my proposal be approved/i will, if desired, submit a detailed estimate of the expenditure involved. 9.
