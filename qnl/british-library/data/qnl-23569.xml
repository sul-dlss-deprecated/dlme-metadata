In continuation of this office express letter of even No. dated 11.12.44, communicating to you the arrival of the above cited craft without a ship’s Navicert, I have the honour to state that on scrutiny of the Export General Manifest issued at the port of shipment to the tindal of the craft, it is found that 2600 H* Bundles were shipped from there for Karachi option catch, option Kathiawar. The local agents have however manifested 3295 H* bundles, stating that 695 H* bundles which are in excess of the ouantity shown in the Export General Manifest, were the persomlal property of the crew, and are being cleared by them at this port. The rest viz. 2500 II* bundles are being taken in the same bottom to Fandvi. The matter is brought to your notice for favour of having necessary enquiries made, regarding the cause of 695 K* bundles being loaded as personal property of the crew and not being included in the Export General Manifest, from Quarter and intimating the result to this custom House in due curse. Par • • •Translation of letter dated 15th I/iuharran 1364 (30-12-44) from H.the Ruler of Qatar to the Political agent, Bahrain. Reference your letter Mo.C/1934, dated 28th December 1944 (13th Muharram 1364). I have investigated the report of the Collector of Customs of Karachi to you and found that the quantity shipped from the port of shipment was as shown in the manifest, 2600 H 1 bundles. If any amount was found in excess of that shown in the manifest and was claimed to have been shipped from the port of shipment as personal property of the crew, it is not true, as it is impossible for auch as amount, which has been mentioned by the Collector, to have been shipped, and not included in the manifest, as the personal property of the crew. Therefore apart from the 2600 bundles manifested, nothing was shipped from Qatar.

The boat ’'Saifodolah*', nakhuda of which was Ghulam Abbas, arrived to ©nr side and unloaded the cargo of the manifest i.e. 1971 bundles of coir rope. Therefore we have verified the manifest in question for the cargo of the aforesaid boat. As regards the boat 'Samhan', it has not arrived here nor its cargo ^mentioned in the manifest, so the latter is returned herewith without verification. U.E.

The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘File 12/7 II Arrival of country craft from India’ (IOR/R/15/2/1376) The file’s principal correspondents are: the Collector of Customs at Karachi; staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain; the Residency Agent at Sharjah; the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast; the Director of Customs at Bahrain (George William Reginald Smith).The correspondence relates to routine enquiries made concerning cargo on specific vessels travelling from Karachi (and Veraval) to the ports of the Persian Gulf, and involves the exchange of export manifests detailing goods landed at different ports. The enquiries begin with letters from the Collector of Customs at Karachi (or Veraval) informing the Political Agent at Bahrain of named vessels travelling to ports in the Persian Gulf, with extracts of their export manifest, and requesting confirmation of their arrival and the verification of the landing of their cargo. These letters are followed by enquiries made by the Political Agent (enclosing export manifests) to the Director of Customs at Bahrain (for vessels travelling to Bahrain), the Residency Agent at Sharjah (for vessels travelling to the ports of the Trucial Coast), and the Ruler of Qatar (for vessels travelling to Qatar), requesting verification of the export manifests. Replies from the Director of Customs at Bahrain, the Residency Agent at Sharjah (in English and Arabic) and the Ruler of Qatar, confirm if vessels have arrived in port or not. Further correspondence includes letters from the Political Agent at Bahrain to the Collector of Customs at Karachi (or Veraval) confirming the arrival (and sometimes non-arrival) of named vessels, enclosing verified (or unverified) export manifests.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Maritime legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Transshipment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000070#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
