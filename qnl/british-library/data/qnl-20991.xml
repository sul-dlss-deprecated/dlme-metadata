Bahrain Affairg * In reply to your telogram Bo I2l8 f I beg to report as follows : As already reported the Shailc of the Dowasir together wit# one Ahmad al lahej the headmen of mother small Sunni tribe and a icrtxrim notorious intriguer, sometime ago visited Ibn 3aud. It is of course not possible M being certain of what took place, but 3haik Ha mad bin Sasa told me in confidence what he h d learnt,and I also neard from another well informed source. It would appear that Hin ^aud offered to asisst them to resist ?ny efforts of the Bahrain Rulers to tax them or to bring them under their effective Control^ He is said to have promised the alternatives - (I) To use his influence to support them should they resist the ^hilers or if they preferred (2) provide them with a suitable habitat in order that they could threaten to leave Bahrain,and in fact do so if necessary. Tji® position as reggrds this tribe is as follov/s- Though nominally acknowledging the oyerlordship of er asa ,t e y have always in the past declined to acknowledge Shaik Hamad as his definite sncoessor.It is believed that they entertained some hopes of getting control of the islands into their own hands in the fntare Bin 3aad may be not unaware of thise designs. Some e- rs ago they used to pay a small diving tax in a commuted form.Even then they resisted direct taxation. For several years they have eeasea oven these payments and the Ruler is afraid to insist on payment. In the past the Ruler has relied on the Dowasir and other Sunni tribes to enable him to overawe the 3hiah Oahrainis and they were always allowed a free hand in their dealings with shiahs. last year when the Bahrainis became increasngly restive,they repeat- 9 dly pressed on . The Agency.Bahrain, * 3 / 7 / 22 . ft **-#0 r \ ' ft The Hon f bl 9 the r olitical Resident in the Persian Grulf,Bushire.2 -edly pressed on Sh&amp;ik Hamad the necessity of talcing repressive ■ easares. The Shaiks however # were thoroughly alarmed and afraid to push atters to theanc extent advocated by the Dowasir* The latter asked per- ission to deal with certain sections of theB^ahrainis themselves,but haik Hamad refused.His own position owing to Abdulla 7 s intrigles was elicate.and he famr was aware that if disorders resulted he might be eld responsible and Abdulla would make much of the situation. The owasir bitterly criticised this attitude,but were also afraid to take he law into their own hands ,since they distrust the Shaiks,and suspett- i that,should their action cause disorders the blame would be nlaced pon them to clear the Shaiks. They hare since frequently tried to )rce Shaik Hamad’s hand by picking quarrels with the Bahrainis t an cample of which was the ’Barbar 1 affair which was reported at the Lme. This matter has never been settled.Although they dare not admit it, lie rulers know that the Dowasir deliberately instigated the affair, key would gladly sacrifice the Bahrainis to placate the Dowasir who mtinue to press for 7 redress 7 but are afraid that such action would luse a revolt among the Shaihs.They therefore continually delay a full aquiry. It is probable thst the recent more determined attitude of the ihrain Shiahs to rid themselves of oppression is displeasing to Biji Lud. I suspect this from the attitude of his agent here in the matter. in Saud has shiah subjects at ^atif who are closely connected with the ihrainis &amp; whom he taxes out of all proportion to their wealth.Keports ive been once or twice received that they were inclined to resent the reatment and on one occasion which was reported!* to you and to the Lgh Commissioner for Iraq,they attempted to approach me ,but were .scouraged as we had no desire to interfere in the affairs of the iltan of Bajd. Also it is becoming increasingly apparent that Bin tud is anxious to have a hand in Bahrain affairs.The same attitude has, believe been noticed by the A. Tuwait in regard to that place. ; would therefore be in his interest* if the inef ficient administrat- of Bahrain continues,enabling him to mage secret alliances with idependent factions such as the Dowasir. Beforms,entailing equitable ix^tion.means support to the Bahrain Grovernement to ehable them tosontrol equally the 3anni and Shiah tribes. The Dowasir hare been jettled so long in Bahrain that they ere recognised as Bahrain subjects, ;n their relations with the shailcs they do not enjoy the good offices &gt;f the Agency,as is the case with all recognised subjects of i*in Baud, lince they are however virtually independent they have no neeacd for moh assistance. The Rulers of Bahrain have recently adopted a somwhat am ► re just attitude towards the shiahs,probably as a result of the warning .ven by Grovernement^but quite recently they appear to be testing their &gt;wer again in this respect,and as in accordance with the instructions * Grovemement I have scrupously avoided interference,they are inclined ► gain confidence. The Bahrainis on the other hand are divided,and ►me of the leaders hse discouraged at having obtained no support from ■M.G. as a result of appeals,whereas others advocate open rebellion lould oppression again increase and are reported to have inserted arms. The sunni tribes are almost pH pearling Nakhudas. reet oppression exists in thf pearl diving,and the majority of the •pressed are shiahs and under British protection,being foreign arabs or •rsians. The Sunni tribes resent all reforms,lest a small beginning lould lead to reforms also in the diving. I would point out that whereas reforms introduced by ie Shaiks,might be a good thing even if imperfectly devised and lefficiently carriid out, it will be a different matter if they are itroduced under pressure from H f M. Govt. In that event every possible .aw will be discovered and exploited. Before embarking on such a 'licy I would therefore respectfully suggest that I may be given iffiwient time to make a more careful study of the present stftte of ►xation and the nature and effect of improvements which could be ■fected.particularly those originally suggested by the ahaiks. It ►uld place us In a most invidious position to insist on reforms if l practice they did not adequately remove cause for grievance. Apart from the question of taxation is the more crying need &gt;r some system which will ensure justice as between Sunnis and iaihs,for this is the grievance which is most likely to react on ^Pinion in neighbouring Shddh countries.We are now in the pearling season and any enquiries now mad^t^ however cireumspeot will arouse the greatest suspicion among the a unni pearlers* I beleive that after the close of the seasqpi a full study of these matters could be made without causing a sti: Also,as already reported I am just finishing negotiations which it is hopedxwill result in a reconciliation between Shailcs Abdulla and Hamad. It would be advisable to test Abdulla f s attitude for some little time.If he proves that he is genuinely prepared tomassist Hamad the introduction of reforms would be to some extent simplified.Otherwise,regrettable though it will be, we shall be compelled first to deal with him,for he would join forces with the Sunni tribes against Hamad to oppose reforms &amp; discord among the ruling family would again result and render effective control by them an impossibility. This report has been written in great haste in order to catch the mail,and I beg that tint its involved nature may be overlooked. I trust that all essential points are however dealt with. Major.

Sir, With reference to the telegram No. 915-S dated 10th July 1922, on the subject of the proposed reforms in Bahrain, I have the honour to submit for the inform- 0 ation of the Government of India a copy of a letter from — * the Political Agent, No.lll/C dated 13th July 1922.0 ' -—— Bahrain on the subject. 2. In this letter Major Daly gives all available in formation about the visit of the Sheikh of the DBwasir to Bin Saud except its date and I am making further enquiries about this. When Bin Saud was at Hasa the Sheikh of Qatar went to see him and some of the Trucial Coast Sheikhs sent presents. In the correspondence regarding the destruction of a tower at Ajraan in 192# I reported that the Sheikh of that place had sent a deputation. Bin Saud in fact is the roost imposing per sonality among the Arabs of these parts and all the petty Sheikhs and tribes of the coast like to keep in with him as far as possible. Most of the Sheikhs on the Truoial Coast fear the Akhwan and abhor their tenets but deem it advisable to make friends with the mammon of unrightunrighteousness - this phrase is perhaps inappropriate as tho Akhwan consider themselves highly righteous - and be on the safe side* It will be seen that Bin Saud appears to have told the Dawasir Sheikh that he would either (a) use his influence to support them in the event oi their deciding to resist taxation or (b) give them suitable habitat so that they could threaten to leave Bahrain* and do so if necessary* 3. It rany not be out of place to mention that this threat of leaving Bahrain is an old plank in the Dawasir platform which they have used with success for years before din Saud came to the front. I well remember tellin Sheikh Isa when I was at Bahrain that such threats were all bluff and that they would never quit the valuable lands and houses they have in Bahrain* but that if by any ohanoe they were foolish enough to do so he could easily get other peoples to occupy the lands and villages. But Sheikh Isa in addition to being very obstinate is exceedingly pusillanimous and timid and has always feared the Dftwasir and allowed them to bounce him. By threats of this sort they obtained the discontinuance of the small diving tax mentioned by the Political Agent. 4. It will be seen that the Political Agent points out that there will be a great difference if the reforms are introduced voluntarily by the Sheikh or under pressure by us. In the latter oase, as Major Daly says* everything will be the subject of great criticism, and we should have to be very careful to make certain that any reform we suggest would effectively remove the cause for grievance. Major Daly accordingly asks for time to study the present state of taxation and the nature and effect of improvements which could be introduced. He suggests that he could go into the matter with less chance of causing a stir at the conclusion of thethe pearling season. I agree with him on both these points and beg to suggest that I may be allowed to defer the submission of reasoned proposals for reforms until the autumn after Major Daly has had time to study the present system (ar laolr of system) and inoidense of taxation, and go into the question of justice between bunnis and Shiahs at the conclusion of the pearling season. 6. I venture to hope that the Government of India will oonour with this view and permit the submission of reasoned proposals to be deferred.

Attach on T AIi by Dowasir tribesmen Heeently there have benn signs of farther attempts of the Dowasir to seek trouble^ with the Baharaneh.A fraeas oeearred at the Pearl Banks in whieh two Dowasir boats closed ij on a boat manned by Baharaneh &amp; severely beat the latter. There have also been some monor distarbanees in the oatside villages.This reeurrenee is doabtl less due to the dilatoriness wi whieh the Shaiks have been dealing with the matter of the ^Ali affair .They have admitted that it is eomnon knowledge that the Dowasir combined &amp; openly attacked T Ali, : Easa A1 Dosari,one of the elders of the tribe &amp; the most sensible of ;hem has told Shaik Hamad the whole story &amp; how he endeavoured to restrain Ahmad A1 Do sari &amp; the others &amp; succeeded in turning back the lajority of the tribesmen.This has been confirmed from independent tourees &amp; by the Bahcmaneh themselves. Shaik Hai ad has at length decide x&gt; take definite action. It was discovered that several persons from Judaiyeh,including some of the personal servants of the elders,had been rounded in the affair &amp; were being kept concealed at Badaiyeh.Meanwhile Ihamis A1 Do sari had quite cheerfully sworn to Shaik Hamad on the livoree of his wife,that nobody whatsoever in Budaiyeh had been mixed up in the affair or had any knowledge of it. Shaik Ham&amp;da ordered the wounded men to bo produced.This the Dowasir have benn unable to do A have made very futile excuses.On the other hand the evidence of a *aan who has been att ending the wounded in secret is available together with a considerable tmount of evidence on oath by villagers of f Ali &amp; other villages through which the Dowasir passed to attack f Ali. Yesterday on receipt of the news of the further fracaa at the diving Shaik Haadflil ordered the appearance of Ahmad A1 Dos^ri in Muharr&amp;q this morning,&amp; v r ill order his detention there pending settlement of the case. He intends to remove him from the recognised leadership oftke triba &amp; to instal Baga A1 dosari v/ko is a fkr More suitable jncrmr person. Ht also proposes to deal witk tke T Ali ease 8 UMMaril 7 .lt would take an indefinite time to exaMine tko hundreds of witnesses who would be produced on either side &amp; would still further unsettle the tribes &amp; Baharaneh.The shara eourt would drag the ease on for Months eqpally without result &amp; the Baharaneh would not aeeept a doeision of the Sunni Qadhi &amp; Yiee yersa. It is tlw Shaiks intention in addition to the renoval of Ahnad A1 Bosari f 20 m the leadership, to roeover fron Budaiyeh the eash oquivalent of all the property looted fron T Ali &amp; payment in aeeordanee with eustoM of blood Money for the killed &amp; wounded,together with a suffieient fine from the Gove mane t of Bahrain for the disorder eaused .He will hold the elders of the Dowasifc responsible for payment in a given time.They are well eapable of dividing it among themselves aeeording to the share they took intec ths fray &amp; doubtless Ahaad *i Bosari &amp; Khamis &amp; thoir followors,who instigatod the whole affair will have to pay tho bi&amp;gost share. I do not antieipate that t ero will be trouble, neither does ShaikMHamad.as the Bowasir appear to be fairly cowed, but the ease is the supreme test of Shaik Hamad T s new regime &amp; any hesitation on his part,should there be delay in payment etc would be fatal &amp; eausef: opposition among all the other sunni tribes, unimportant though they are eompared with the Bowasit. It seemc absolutely essentiel therefore,that should neeessity arise,we should support Shaik Hamad. A gunboat is now here &amp; likely to remain for some time.I would suggest that if there is any show of defiance at the meeting to-day,I be authorised to f* sk tho CoMMander to move up &amp; take up a position off Budaiyeh.This would hrve great moral effeet .Should there be still further troublo.it m ight bo neeossary after due warning,to undertake a light bombardwent of Budaiyeh or at any rate fire a few rounds over the town.I should be glad ,if on rede ipt of this report ,you would kindly instruet me telegraphically, as to whether ,in the event of neeessity arising,!

Sir, 1 have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your telegren dated 4th February regarding the threatening attitude of the Bow&amp;sir ribe at Dhammem on the return frow Tiyadh of the deputation which they had sent to Kla Highnesa the Sultan of Kejd. 2 . On the 21st of January, aa repor ed in my telegram of that date, I heard that the deputation had returned and that the tribe had hoisted their wur flag© at Bhammam and had noised abroad that Bin Baud had told their deputation that he would not allow tneir property in Bahrain to be sold and would see that they returned to their village shortly, also given out that they intended to raid Bahrain. In the same telegram as he reported this the Political Agent mentioned that the wireless station was to be closed for repairs for ten days from the 1st February. 1 hat. not previously been informed of this by the Indo-European ele- -graph Department, and it might have caused considerable inconvenience to be completely cut off from Bahrain a* that particular moment* fortunately 11*11.S.'Crocus** was in port aw&amp;iting jjlght iion'blc J.

W. 1*3 awaiting hotfmails before proceeding down the coast, so I was able to ask the Commander if he could proceed at once to Bahrain both to act as a deterrent to the Bowasir and to enable communication to be kept up with the Political Agent. Commander Ailson was fortunately in a position to proceed at once, being his own maoter as H.M.s.'Crocus' happened to be the only ship in the Gul*f at the moment. He accord* -ingly left on 31st January and arrived early 1st February. Bhammam being only *uite a short distance off the Bahrain Islands, H.M.f ,'Crocus’* could not have repelled a sudden raid on the north-west comer of the main Island where Budalya is situated but he presence did act as a deterrent, r and on hearing of her arrival, the Dowasir evidently seeing that the British Havy was on the qui-vive assumed a quieter demeanour, and did not attempt to raid. Accordingly everything having been quiet for more than a week and the wireless station repaired, H.M.S.'Crocus' left Bahrain on the 9th February. 3. After receiving in your above mentioned telegram authority to write to Bin Paud about the matter, I consulted the Political Agent as to the advisability of doing so, and At first decided not to do so In case it should only irritate Bin laud. But later on having heard from Major Daly that . * Bis Highness had behaved veil in refusing to allow Shaikh Ibrahim bin Kh&amp;lid, a nephew of Shaikh Isa, concerned in the recent outrage at Bitrah, to enter hie territory and in having him turned bad. from Cjair, and was in other Blatters assuming a lees interfering attitude, I decided to send the letter in the hope that it would give His Highness the im- •pulse required to make him refuse further assistance to the rowasir. I accordingly wrote a letter A&amp;ted 14th February onon tho lines mentioned in my telcgrriai lio. 10 da^ed 51st January, and annis* a copy of the rn^lish version of it for your information. I hope it *ill result in Bin Saud remevinc the Do^aair to Jubail or its neighbourhood, which will get them out of easy ittiding distance from Bahrain. I knot* that Bin Saud originally wanted to settle the tribe thnre but they objected to going so far afield, firstly because they would be too completely in his power and feared his tyranny and oppression which are notorious, end secondly because they hoped to be able from *kha&amp;«nm r/hasenam to intimidate the Thalkh of Bahrain and to be in a position to return to Bu&amp;aiya or not as it pleased them. Tiey have probably found out their mistake on the ceccnd opinion and it is to be hoped that they will be given an opportunity to find themselves right in the first. 4. It certainly seems to be 4 he fact that the Multan js assuming a less truculent attitude in reg&amp;rc to Bahrain affairs, and I think life may be accounted for by the fact 'hat he does not fekl himself so s rotig as he did. 1 time roue reports are heard in Baghdad, Kuwait and o .her places that His Highness* power is on the wans and I append for your information a copy of a memorandum on this subject from the Political Agent, Kuwait, and of another from the ollticc Agent, Bahrain, on the same subject, for which I a^ked on receipt of the first. £• In regard to Bin Paud*s recent illness I yesterday saw Captain Holmes, who had just returned from a visit to Bin Paud at Kofhuf with his father Major Holmes of the Pastern 'yndica e. I is Highness informed them that hehua a bo re plaoe InBlue the corner of his mouth which suddenly swelled up and caused his whole face to swell «nd he himself to become wery ill.

Sir. In continuation of my latter la. 11/140-2 dated the 22nd February regarding the threatening attitude of the Eowasir tribe of Bahrain at Bhamruaa, 1 have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter which I have receive© from 11 dated 16th P&amp;Jab (22nd February 1924). : His Highness the Sultan ot Nejd in reply to my letter Bo. 49 dated 14th February 1924, a copy of which was enclosed in my above-mentioned letter. 2 . It will be seen that His Highness repudiates the rumours that he had encouraged the tribe or talked %o them about the recovery of their property in Bahrain. Jut he styles the recalltrant tribesmen as 1 ttuhajarin v and seems inclined to give the matter a religious turn and pose as the Champion of Islamic Custom. As a mater of fact, the appeal o the 2hara* has, in the past, always been the last resort of the 1 * 0 wasir. dfasnsver they have been taken to task for misdeeds they have invariably offered to submit to the decision oX the th&amp;ra* which, in the case of so powerful a body as hey were when in Bahrain, has always resulted in 4 their escaping scott free, since, needless to the local ails were afraid to give a decision against them. 3.

If he doee, ;hio will be a good thing as it will remove the tribe from easy raiding distance of Bahrain, and thus reduce the possibility of alarms and excursions with regard to raids by them. In any case whether the tribe is at Jubail or Dhammam it will be necessary to increase the usual patrolling of the 1 earl Banks by His Majesty’s Ships to prevent the Powasir from attempting to use the Banks used by Bahrain boats and ao prevent possible attacks by the tribe on Bahrain boats.

He stated that he would visit Bahrain before the middle of April, and I informed him that you would put him au fait with all the details. I told him that in the circumstances of the case if the Bowasir came on to the usual Bahrain Banks there is sure to be trouble, and asked him to discuss the matter with you and arrange, if possible, for suitable and fairly frequent patrolling of the Banks. He informed me that the 'Cyclamen' would shortly be com- -pleting her refit and returning to the Gulf, while he was expecting H.M.S.

On the introduction of the reforms in Bahrain in 1923 this tribe gave trouble, and it was found necess- -ary to punish them by inflicting a fine of fis. 15,000/- on their leading Shaikh. The fine was paid, but rather than submit to the new regime the tribe left their native town of Budaiya and migrated to the promontory of Dammam on the coast of v^atif, forfeiting their property in Bahrain and — theoretically, though apparently not in practice — their diving rights on the Bahrain pearl 3. When I was in Bahrain in September last, three Shaikhs of the tribe called on me to pay their respects. Two, Abdul Latif bin Ibrahim and Isa bin Saad, are gray- -beards whom I knew twenty years ago; the third, Ahmad bin Abdallah bin Hasan, a fiery and intolerant young man of about 30, is the son of the powerful headman of my time. It was he who led the tribe in their defiance to Colonel To Dowaoir tribe of Bahrain Sir I have the honour to refer to the correspondence banks Knox(v^) loV Knox in 19S«S V and he otill raaintains a stiff-necked and unreasonable attitiide. 4.

They had interviewed Shaikh Hamad bin Isa and had confessed to him that they were in very straitened circumstances as the Amir (Wahhabi Governor) of C^atif was imposing taxes on them although Ibn Baud had promised four years ago to exempt then for a period of years. It seems probable also that they have been asked for a quota of men to serve in the Sultan’s army. - w 5. When tha^ appeared before me they at once /Laised the question of the return of the tribe to Bahrain. 1 told them that conditions had much improved since their departure and that they must not ha expect to be allowed back on the same footing as they had previously arrogated to themselves. I thought they could never again claim to be internally independent of the Puler of Bahrain. They would have to pay the same taxes as other agriculturists and traders, they must be submissive to the Shaikh’s Courts in Manameh and Muharraq, and they should accept the police post which had been established in their chief town. Their official headmen would be nominated and could be changed, if necess- 1 -ary, by the Huler, and their Bahar^ni (Shiah) tenants and negro divers would be fully protected and have equal rights of citizenship with others of their class. 6. Young Ahmad bin Abdallah said that in these cir- -cumstances they preferred to remain in Dammam ! The others evidently wish to return at any price, but they are overawed by the younger man. 7. Personally, I think it inevitable that the Dowasir tribe will return eventually to Bahrain. Their deserted town3 (Q\ town of Budaiya, substantially built of stone and mortar, and their villages and date-gardens are silently calling for them. They are Kalikis in sect, like most of the Sunnis in Bahrain, and many are prosperous pearl merchants. Life on the mainland under Wahhabi rule and exclusion from the Bazaars of Bahrain is hateful to them. They have no ambition to found new towns or plant new gardens. Shaikh Hamad Mn Isa undoubtedly has some sympathy for them, as he has always retained the brother of Shaikh Abdul Latif in his personal service. 8. How I hear that Shaikh Ahmad bin Abdallah and another Posari, Kharais bin Shahin, have applied to and f received from Shaikh Hamad bin Isa letters of recommendat- -ion to carry to the 4mir of Hasa and the Sultan of Hejd himself l I fully anticipate that they will return with a letter from His Majesty, asking Shaikh Hamad to restore to the tribe their possessions. 9. It seems desirable, if the Government of India are willing to endorse my views as expressed to the three Shaikhs in Bahrain, that the amiable but weak rhaikh Hamad should be so informed in an authoritative fashion. If he is to modify to any extent the terms on which Ibn Saud may ask him to receive back the tribe, he will be glad to be able to reply that he cannot disregard the advice given him by the Government of India on such a matter. 10.

Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Bated 20th Shawaal, 1345 Sir, The H, B. JTi’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Return of the Dawasir. I have the honour to inform you of the following facts and reouest that you will please make them known to the Hon*hie the Political Resident who would perhaps give a ruling on the questions in point which have not been speci fically raised before. The Hon*hie the Political Resident informed H # E. Shaikh Hqmad that the Government of I^dia were prepared to sanction the return of the Dawasir to Bahrain on the condition that they accepted certain terms. If they agreed to these terms their property consisting of houses in Manama and Budaiya, dategardens and ’’Doulabs” were to be returned to them. Their property has been return to them. T^e houses, which had been sold by the State, were bought baok and oorapensation was paid to the buyers on aooount of repairs executed by them during their term of residenoe; the leases of all the gardens which had been let by the State during the three years absence of the Dav/asir from Bahrain, have been transferred back to the original owners. This has oost the State Ra. 40,000/-. But the Dawasir Shaikhs now demand that the State should r eturn to them all the rents which accrued from the gardens, Wie during the three years, amounting to Rs.bq-^&gt;d^ =- page -2-. They evidently consider that the perraisaion granted then to return, and the restoration of thoir property ty the State, wipes out any idea that they deserved punishment for their former behaviour. They insist that the restoration of their property must ^ilso include the repayment of the three years rents. Unfortunately they have persuaded Shaikh Hamad to agree with their views. At the time of their intended departure, they were warned that if they persisted in going, their / property would be oonfisoated, and their Bahraini divers would be freed from any obligation or debts to their Bawasir TTarkhudas. They understood the terms and they went. The State released the divers giving each man a certificate signed by the Shaikh and the Political Agent cancelling his debts and allowing him to dive with whomsoever he wished. The State sold most of the houses and let the gardens. The ownership of the property, presumably, reverted to the State. Although the Dawasir suffered a certain amount of oppression from the Ruler of Ile.jd during their stay on the mainland they now adopt the attitude of being strongly supported by Ibn Saud. Shaikh Hamad is at all times exceedingly anxious to stand well in the eyes of Ibn Saud. This fact and the continuous pestering ty the Oawasir Shaikhs has contributed mainly to his attitude on the subject. Also he thinks that if the rents are not paid to them the Dawasir will always feel sore on the subject considering themselves rightlypap:e -3- ri g h tly entitled to them. He feels that heoause the original oonfisoation was raade in his name ( an action which he only took after considerable persuasion) it is incumbent on him to return the money and as no mention was made of the rents in the terms on whioh the Dawaslrs return he supposes that the return of the rents is taken for granted. In roy opinion, being as financial Adviser, responsible for the finances of the State, this large outlay from the already overburdened revenues of the State in order to buy the goodwill of the Dawasir is not justifiable, unless it is the intention of the Government that all measures that were previously taken against the Dawasir by the Go vernlTien ^ aro entirely wiped out, except of oourse their three years exile whioh is past, in whioh case I venture to suggest that a wrong impression will be given, the impression that the Government have now decided that it acted wrongly in punishing the tribe in the way that it did. You kindly said that you would support me in an endeavour to prevent large payments. My own position here is difficult and were it generally known that I was the deciding factor in preventing this payment, it would be decidedly more difficult. I therefore ask that a definite ruling should be given on these two points. 1. Whether the rents for the three years paid Into the State funds by tenants on the confiscated estates must be handed back to the Dawasir. 2. Whether the Bahrain State is to force the divers of the Dawasir^who were freed from all debts and obligation to dive with their Daivasir IJarkhudas y to return to the Dawasir, or whether the State is to compensate these Narkhudas for the loss of the divers, and the writing off of the divers* debts ( a ma-ter of probably two or three lacs).page -4- I may a&amp;i that the Dawasir are not in the almost starving condition whioh they are at present representing themselves to he as several of then have lately bought large boats from Bahrain, Also the Shaikh’s opinion as to the further restoration of their alleged rights is not helfl even by his own family, as Shaikh Abdulla, his brother, and Shaikh Salman, his eldest son, are not in agreement with him on the subject. was made in this yecar’s budget for any payments to the Dft’vasir neither for another heavy item, l.e., the payment for Indian Troops lent by the Government of India.

Sheikh Hamad hin lea al Khalifa to this office. As will he seen it deals ,-ith the subject of the return of pa»t rents to the -Dowasir tribe, two other suc-C communications have been received from His Excellency lately, *8 well as several verbal requests for informa tion on the subject. I understand that the howasir wealth has been very much depicted during their absence on the mainland,pre sumably they had to build or buy houses for themselves, pby heavy taxes to Ibn Saud and incur other expenditure inseparaole from moving once goods and chattels from one place to another. In addition to this they lost the reve nue of their property here and will, on their return jikx have to engage in repairs to their houses atilellijah most of which will require some form of renovation. Considering this it seems that it might be a good policy to start them off with a little capital, Hajor Barrett suggested one third of their property revenues which accrued to the State during the three .years of their absence, which amounted to Rs.64,000/-, this would be just over Rs.21,000/-. In view of the circumstances under which this tribe leit -ahrein, I think this tould be a very gener ous donation to them, and, when they know definitelyTranalation of a letter dated the 3rd LI al ^adah 1345, from K.L.Sheikh Hamad bin laa al hha^ifa to H.tt'a Political Agent, Bahrein. ago I wrote a letter to Major Barrett, H.M'a Political /igent in Bahrein, with regard to the moniea of the Jo asir tribe which lias been in the hands of the Government for the last three .years. - proposed that half the sum oe paid in this year and half after Gaffal this year.

From To Captain C.G.Prior, I.A., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No. C-53., dated 24th April 1927, with an enclosure dated the 20th Shawal 1345, from the Financial Adviser, Bahrain, on the subject of the return of the Dowasir tribe. The Hon 1 ble the Political Resident is of the opinion that where the tribe has been punished with expulsion for three years, for offences which they have committed, they should certainly not be given the rents which have accrued to the Bahrain Government during their absence, as this would undo the result of the punishment given. It would, in fact, be a confession on our part that we had acted harshly. With regard to your suggestion that a third of the rentals should be returned on account of repairs necessary to the deteriorated properties and of the poverty of the tribe, the Political Resident considers that if any sum is found necessary for such a purpose, that sum should have no connection with the forfeited rentals. The allotment should rather take the form of an act of government on the part of Bahrain who, having justly punished the tribe, now forgives them on a promise of better behaviour for the future and allows them a sum2 ( HI sum for the rehabilitation of their properties and their being made productive. On the same principle he agrees with your recommend -ation that no diver shall be forced to return to the Dowasir with his previous debt maintained against him. These debts having been cancelled once could not be again placed upon the debtors, who have probably taken other work. These,points should be made clear to Shaikh Hamad and it should be impressed upon him that they are necessities of good government. The Government of India have been addressed upon these lines, and on receipt of their reply, you will receive a further communication regarding this question. I have the honour to be.

Regarding the Dawasir question; there is no change in the situation since ny letter wo 558/K of 28th Kejab. rhe .uawasir Shaikhs, especially Ahmed, bin Abdulla, continue to pester Shaikh named with requests for more money and demands tnut their divers should be forced to return to them, or that he should pay them their divers’ debts. JMot only do they worry him themselve but I am certain that they induce Abdulla bin fair, the Shaikh's confidential steward who has much influence with his master, to try to persuade the Shaikh to do what they wish. Aodulla uin Jaur is himself a Dawaair and related to some of the Shaikhs. A small matter of some ground in the bazaar which was claimed ’ey Ahmed bin Abdulla has now been settled. The ground was gifted ty the Shaikh to the municipality when it was confiscated from the uawasir, it'has now been taked back from the Municipality and handed over to Ahmed bin Abdulla. About a week ago Shaikh Hamed recieved the enclosed letter, to which D attach a translation, from Bin Saoud. In my opinion it is a most unwarrantable piece of interference on the part of the nuler of iMegd in Bahrain affairs. it is little less tnan a tniniy veiiea oraer to Shaikh Hamea that he snouia settle to tneir satisiaction the demands of tne .uawasir, who are presumably bhaikh famed's subjects, and then inform Bin oaoud wten he has done so. ihe H rights ' of the JJawasir to which .bin Saoud refers are Interpreted by the Dawasir Shaikhs, and understood by Shaikh Hamed himself to mean payment of all rents from their lands during their absence and the return to them of their divers who were released. When the question of these demands was first raised you wrote to Shaikh Hamed and informed him definitely that the divers\&lt;p were not to be made to return. rhis letter was i believe the result of a decision made by the nesident. me Uawasir narhudas are not pressing this claim because they urgently require the divers themselves, there is not the least difficulty in getting divers, but because the divers who were released had huge sums debited against them by their narhudas . A narhuda in Bahrain counts the debts owing to him by his divers almost as capital as even under the present improved conditions in many cases the narnuda can hand on his divers for their value in his books, that is for the amount which they are indebted. The divers of the Dawasir when freed from their debts and their Dawasir narhudas went off diving with clean sheets under other Bahrain narhudas and have seen diving since the Dawasir left. Not only would it ue unfair to the divers |but it would be unfair to the nev. narhudas if the j were made to jo back. in connection with divers there is an urgent question which needs settling at once. me Dawasir who have come back, shaikh Aedel Lutif and his following, are now subject to the ordinary rules and laws in hahrain. Their divers must comply with the diving rules. Their narhudas must pay the divers ijtxgx&amp;RjcjsU- the advances ordered ' ♦ xhis thry are williog to do but v/hen they their divers* account books they enter up against every man debts of such size that I feel certain that they are wrong. The aivers are illiterate and incapable of protecting their own interests, they have nobody to support their interests except the Government. When Major Daly instituted the Diving Reforms he sent every diver v.ith his narhuda to the ivadi, Shaikh Jasim, and the Tbadi settled how-much of the supposed back debts were true. 1 recently called on the Kadi Shaikh Abdel Latif bin Saau and discussed the question with him. He agreed that something ought to be done to prevent the Dawasir narhudas from writing up against their divers amounts that they did not really owe and suggested that instead of sending them direct m ^he Shera Court the accounts should be looked into by the Government and then any doubtful cases to be passed to the Shera. I think this would be a sound plan but naturally thcB. narhudas will resent it.1 . 3 .) \^ N 'Vith reference to the second question, the back rents, the Dawasir were to^d that they could not be jiven these but the v were promised financial help to repair their tow* of Budeya. A sum of ifc 10,000 v/as set aside for this purpose. The only Shaikh of the Dawnsir who returned was Abdel Latif and he was oaid a certain sum, as I explained in my former letter. None other of the Dawasir have really returned to Budeya and I do not myself oelieve that they intend coming at present. i’he second pearling season since they were jiven permission to return is now close on hand and they v. ill not move before the Rekba. I sujjest that until they actually do return no more money should be paid to them for repairing Budeya. They would use it for other purposes and then ask for more. , Shaikh named told the uawasir Shaikhs that their demands for rents and divers were not admissable. When tellinj them this he would certainly place the responsibility of the refusal on the Political Ajent and 1 expect he showed t?em your letter on the sub j e c t. bhe -Uawasir Shr ikhs, of whom Ahmed bin Abdulla is the most active and influential, then complained to Din Saoud. ihey probably informed Din Daoud that siiaikh named was willing to jive in to them ut had been advised by the Political Ajent not to do so. Bin Saoud now writes to The Shaikh tellinj him, almost orderinj him, to accede to the Dawasir demands, knowin; that this would mean acting against the written advice of the Political Ajent. When Shaikh Hamed discussed the matter with me I told him that I thought Bin Saoud’c letter was almost an order. I think he rather thought this too. He said that he had decided with your approval to delay replying until he could ask the advice of the Resident 'when he visits Bahrain. ; * r&lt; i Yours sincerely.Translation of letter from Bin S; oud to Shaikh hamed.

On my last visit to Bahrain 1 made a visit to the ow.-.tir village and called on the one Powaair Shaikh who haa permanently returned, by name fhulkh Xitui Abdul aatif. This Chief would never hawe left Bahrain had he not been forced to do so and he took the first opportunity to return, accompanied by between 250 to 300 of his tribe. He told me that he controlled some 600 or 700 of hie tribe but that the Wahabis would not allow the remainder of Me tribe to return. he Wahabi authorities state that the men may go but that the women-and children uu.it remain in Husa, end Shaikh Abdul *tif asked me if l could take action to assist him. his i Will do immediately if i meet ibn Baud. Shaikh Abdul *4»tif also informed me that there is only one hothead among the Shaikhs who is stopping the desire of the others to return. Otherwise the whole tribe would return if allowed to by the -uhabia. r hei'e2 'here the matter must rest for the moment, but X will watch the question and report a^&amp;ln in a few months. he lolltical A^ent is of the opinion that my visit to . xiaiich Abdul Latif will have a considerable effect on Shaikh Hamad, f^iose volatile mind had cjuite forgotten the ?)owuBir question which at one ti’rie so occupied him.
