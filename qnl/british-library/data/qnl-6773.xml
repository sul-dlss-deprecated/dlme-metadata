SECRET. POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. II. Select lie|H)rts mid Telegraiiis from Sir Mark Svkes. REPORTS. Xo. 4 (Secret ). Athens, 12th J une 1915. I have the honour to report that to-day, with the approval of Sir Francis TJliot, I interviewed His Highness Prince Sabah-ed-Pin at the house of Mr. F. L. W hittall. His Highness made a length}- statement regarding the intentions and aspirations of the political party of which he is leader. He stated that his party had suffered a great deal at the hands of the Committee and the Germans, that a great number of its leaders were in prison, that military officers belonging to it had been shot, and that people had been sent to Athens from Constantinople with orders to kill him at the tirst opportunity. However, he considered his party strong in the Smyrna garrison, numerous in Constantinople, and popular among the masses of the Turkish people, but he had to admit that in Gallipoli neither among the officers nor men were there any adherents of his cause. He further stated that he had no communications either with the Arabs in Syria or the Armenians in Zeitun or Eastern Armenia. His hope was to obiain assistance from the Allies to provoke a military revolution in Smyrna, extend it to Constantinople, overthrow the existing Government and make separate terms of peace with the Allies ; his idea being that with a revolution at the Capital the Turco-German resistance at Dardanelles would collapse. He made it quite clear that this course would be impossible without assistance from the Allies, but did not specify what form the assistance should take. The terms of peace which His Highness had in mind in event of such a scheme being feasible were as follows : — U.) The cession of certain small territories to the Allies, from which I inferred the Lebanon to France, Basra to Great Britain, and a slight modification of the Russo-Turkish boundary in Asia— however, on this point His Highness was not precise, partly perhaps owing to his not having a very clear geographical knowledge of Asiatic Turkey. ii.) The neutralization of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles and the dismantling of the forts. iii.) The retention of Constantinople by Turkey. iv.} The adoption of a wide scheme of reforms, including decentralization and the establishment of local autonomy in all parts of the Empire, under a scheme of regions compatible with national aspirations. v.i The transfer of the Caliphate by the Sultan to a member of the Koraysh. He cited, as a support to his hopes that such terms would be acceptable to the \llies. the British declaration that our war was with the existing 'Turkish Government and not with the Ottoman people. l . His Highness further informed me that in the event of the Allies being unwilling to help him in such a venture, he mi^ht, if I,e had the.r ar»nt nvil briii^ about a revolution on similar lines when Gallipoh had fallen, bu? before Constantinople was taken. He thought that perhaps the Allies might be willing to forego the capture of Constantinople in order to spare 8. 290. Athe population and monuments of the city, and avoid the inevitable losses which the Allies would sustain in the final operations between the Narrows and the Bosphorus. Under such circumstances His Highness said that the cession of Gallipoli to the Allies would be included in terms of peace similar to those already mentioned. Finally, His Highness said that in event of the Allies not approving such a course, his party would hold their hand until Constantinople had actually fallen, when the revolutionary action would be easy. Under such circumstances the new Government would be able to treat with the Allies on the same terms, the Constantinople clause being eliminated from the discussion owing to its having been lost by the present Ottoman ( lovernment. His Highness does not impress one as being a man likely to carry through a great political move such as the first and second courses he mentioned would entail; however, it is quite possible that no great abilities would be wanted in the third ease. His attitude with regard to the Caliphate was that his party desired the severance of religion from affairs of State, and that the possesbion of the Caliphate engendered the ill-will both of France and England, and that the transfer of the othce would enable the Ottoman Government to legislate on a basis of religious equality in Turkey more easily when the Sultan was no longer a religious emblem. I asked His Highness to whom he would expect the ollice would be transferred, and he replied at once the ' Sherif of Mecca.' 1 then asked His Highness whether it was not necessary that the Caliph should be an independent Prince, and he replied that his party would be quite ready to recognise the independence of the Sherif in Mecca and Medina. This was substantially all that Prince Sabah-ed-Din said with regard to the situation in Turkey, though he insisted at great length on the evils of Russia having possession of Constantinople, and 1 could see that his real object was to prevent this taking place. I will inform Captain Deeds of Prince Sabah-ed- Din's views at the first opportunity, and he will be able to give an opinion as to what practical influence they may have in Turkey, and what actual power Prince Sabah-ed-Din's party has. 1 have, cM:c., No. 14 (Secret). Shepherds Hotel, Cairo, Sir, 14th July 1915. 1 have the honour in the following despatch to give a summary of the views of the various persons whom I have seen in Cairo who are repre sentative of various shades of Syrian, Arabian, Armenian, and Moslem opinion, and 1 venture to include herein an appreciation of certain phases of the situation as they may be seen from this angle. The Sultan .—Sir Henry MacMahon considered it advisable enough to introduce me to His Highness, and it happened that 1 saw him very soon after the late attempt upon his life. His bearing showed extreme courage and contempt of death, but at the same time it was not di Hi cult to distinguish the grief which the outrage caused him in view of his devotion to his people. In the course of conversation His Highness expressed his conviction that Syria should form a part of the Egyptian Government. I think that this view is not the result of any personal ambition, but a natural desire on the part of a descendant of Mohammed Ali to restore once more the kingdom as the genius of the founder of his house conceived it. Moreover, it is a patent fact that the position of His Highness is weak because his position as Sultan has no moral sanction of any kind in the eyes of Moslems. This is a matter in which personal popularity and goodness of character can play no part. At present His Highness hears a title the Caliph alone can confer, yet has received his office at the hands of a Christian power. Had he been appointed by the assembly, or even invited to assume the position by a body of religiously learned persons, he would have some claim on the allegiance''' •' c ' 1 'W&gt;''»iry I,., „„„ as ruler bv a boilv of \| r I moral sanction as being desired view or his JL-Z?

Ul 1 ' m . eth . ods pursued by which the result is arrived at are dift' ult lo detect, but it is manifest that the idea is abroad lhat Great Uritain aud •ranee each desire the whole of Svria from El Arisli to Alexandretta for themselves As far as one can see this atmosphere of suspected rivalry is produced on lhe one hand by the known opinions of certain Frenchmen who favour the pushing ol the Syrian claims ol France to the furthest degree, these are no doubt stimulated by the influence of M. Vitalis who is'himself moved by personal considerations and his connection with M. Hugneninwho in turn is n Swiss and not out of touch with the ramifications of German Constantinople ri nance. &lt; )n the other hand we have in the opposite direction the constant expression ol Syrian Moslem hopes that Great Britain will take Syria. These hopes are very likely fostered in some devious way by the agents of the Committee of ( nion and Progress. In this way suggestion of rivalry between Great Britain and France is produced in Cairo, just as the suggestion oPAnglo- Russian rivalry is spread about in Athens and Sofia. In both cases 'the suggestions emanate from people who speak in all sincerity but whose views are traceable to ultimate sources of a hostile kind. Captain St. Quentin late Military attache at Constantinople attached to the I rench military mission in Fgypt, whom I met, expressed his opinion to me that the idea of rivalry was fostered in some such way, and cited as examples the article in the Revue Hchdoinadaire of June the 5th by Senator Frandin and the Anglo-phil gossip of local Syrians which was constantly being dinned in the ears of Frenchmen in Egypt. In spite of the fact that all discussions on this subject are forbidden in the press, and that the British authorities give no countenance to either view, the atmosphere of doubt remains and will remain until the British and French Governments clear up the matter by some definite pronouncement. It will be seen from the above that in making any investigation in the matter of Syrian opinion or solution of the Turkish question, one was obliged to walk rather warily. I will now proceed to give the views of the various persons whom 1 interviewed. Said Pasha Sin caiii .— Expressed the view that annexation by France was undesirable from the Syrian point of view both .Moslem and Christian, owiug to the petty methods of French administration, the probability of navigation laws and tariffs in favour of French interests, the ruthless methods of exploitation practised by French concessionaires and the influence which financiers have with the French Government. He anticipated further that the French would develop religious antagonism by supporting Christians against Moslems, that from a narrow point of view this was desirable, but4 ultimately would prove contrary to the general good. He considered that a revolutionary scheme such as that sketched m ^ omsc ])., Map \ . (though 1 had necessardy to be vague on this point) would only be possible if the various regions were under some form ol European contiol, the Impcnal army and &amp; fleet completely abolished, and the Imperial taxes subjected to International control. Dr. F a uis N imu .—Editor of the Mokattavi held similar views. He strongly objected to the division of Syria and Palestine, either as annexed territory or under devolution, though he thought if Damascus could he included in Palestine under British protection, and the Lebanon retained in Syria, there would be a considerable advantage to the Syrian Christians by the elimination of a large body of Moslems and a consequent increase in the size of the Christian minority in Syria. He also expressed the view that the retention of even the shadow of Ottoman power under any devolutionary scheme was dangerous to Syrian interests owing to the ingrained subservience of Arabs to Turks in moments of crisis. 1 could hardly ascertain which he dreaded most, a recrudescence, of Ottoman oppression or French financial exploitation. Neither Dr. Nimr nor Said Pasha Shucair had the slightest hope of an independent Syria holding together for a day. M. Bum-:vi an .—The Tashnakest editor of the Iloussaper, whom 1 saw gave me what 1 believe are the intentions and aspiraticns of his party. He spoke with a tone of considerable certainty and some authority, and I should judge that he has a high position of an occult kind in the organi sation to which he belongs. He spoke somewhat slightly of Boghos Kubar Pasha, as a person who had only lately taken an interest in Armenian affairs, but owing to his rank and position the Tashnakest party had decided to use him as an instrument. He said that the Tashnakests would stand out for autonomy under international protection, but that they would be prepared to accept the suzerainty of Russia. He was very decided on the (juestion of the division of Armenia, and made it quite clear no partition of greater and lesser Armenia would be accepted. He stated that in the terms of settlement the Armenians would have no mercy on those who had expropriated lands during the last 30 years, and that such persons would be 'suppressed which term he subsequently used in connection with the 20 who were lately hanged at Constanti nople. On the other hand he said Armenians would be prepared to compound ancient Kurdish feudal rights, lie told me that from private advices he had received no Moslems now survived in the city of Van, that the district was rapidly filling with refugees from the Caucasus, and that the Armenians hoped soon to be in possession of Mush. As regards the limits of Armenia, he showed me, on a map an area very similar to that marked on Maps I. and 11. He agreed that the ' six vilayets ' was only a vague term and that their boundaries were not satisfactory enough to form the basis of an autonomous vassal state, he was doubtful ns O ■ • • to the inclusion of Sivas. Diarbekir, and Kaiseruk, but considered Erzemm and Erzinjian essential. As regards any devolutionary scheme he admitted that under devolution there were wider opportunities of ultimately developing a real independent state with an outlet on the Mediterranean and Black Seas, but urged that to get Armenians to go back to even nominal vassalage to the Ottomans would be a very difficult task, if they had actually won their independence. 1 was much struck by his grasp of detail on ethnographic and geo graphical problems, and his very close knowledge of the most minute personal circumstances obtaining in remote districts. Mohid Din el Ki rdi .— This person is a learned man, the chief of the Riwak-ul-Akrad of the A1 Azhar university, and is in consequence in touch with Kurdish opinion. As I had known him before the war he spoke very freely to me. lie said that owing to language, religious divergence, and the wide determination of the Kurdish people in tribes that there could be no hope of a Kurdish state. Personally he believed that militant Islam was a * Report of Tnterdepai-tmental Committee on Asiatic Turkey.\\ailing lon e, tliat Haliaism was typical of future developments. He said that the calamity ol the present war (which lie regarded as a judgment on mankind) was of such magnitude that he could not believe that old 1 radii ions and formulae would survive it for lon^. Me believed that when peace ultimately came that there would be a great s pii | i 'al and social change ot a pacificist kind and that mankind, chastened by tribulation, would come together under some new dispensation. He said that no doubt political arrangements would be necessary and that external forms would be matters of consideration for a time, but that the growing lorce beneath the surface would eventually rise and reduce the existing symbols to things ol slight importance. 1 lowtver, speaking from a practical point of view, he said that it would be in the interests of humanity and accelerate the action of the good principle in the world, il the Allies (on the fall of ( onstantinople) were to humiliate and reduce the prestige of the Ottoman dynasty as much as possible. The dynasty represents the iorce of militarism in Asia as Prussia does in Europe, and so long as it retains the Caliphate and the Sultanate, the world will know no peace. 1 le hoped that the Ottomans would be reduced to the position of simple Amirs of Anatolia, and that Irak and Damascus would be Sultanates like Egypt under the nominal suzerainty of the Sherif of Mecca and the actual protection of European powers. Rksiiid Kida .—In sharp contradiction to the foregoing view, is that of Shaykh Ueshid Hida, who isa leader of Pan-Arab and Pan-Islamic thought. In conversation he talks much as he writes. 1 le is a hard uncompromising fanatical Moslem, the mainspring of whose ideas is the desire to eliminate Christian influence and to make Islam a political power in as wide a field as possible His mental arrogance is, I think, attributable chiefly to the idea that Oreat Britain is afraid of Islam, and that Hritish policy first and foremost is planned to sooth Moslem opinion and to concilitate Moslem prejudice. Thou ah suave and well mannered, I can only describe his attitude as trucu lent. He said that the fall of Constantinople would mean the end of Turkish military power, and therefore it was necessary to set up another Mohammedan state to maintain Mohammedan prestige. I asked him if the action of the Sultan in accepting the dictation of the Cicrman Emperor was in consonance with the independence of the Caliph, whether such ' people as Enver, Talaat, J avid, and Carasso could be considered as Moslems, whether the Committee of Union and Progress had not slaughtered Khojas and Ulema w ithout mercy, whether the whole policy of the young Turks had not been originally anti-religious in the widest sense. To this he replied that in the eyes of Islam, Turkey represented Mohammedan independence, and that the actions of individuals had no influence on this view, and that when he had criticised the actions of the Committee, he had been subject to attack and loss of prestige. He gave it as his view that the Egyptians would never be reconciled to British 'tutelage, and that Indian Moslem discontent would increase as time went on that when Turkey fell Islam would require the setting up of hm absolutely independent Arabia including Syria and Mesopotamia, under the What''struck me most was that he never pretended for a moment that if Great Britain assisted in this scheme there would be the slightest, diminution of discontent either in India or Egypt. The liberties and con- lidention o-iven to Moslems by Great Britain in the past did not seem to ] L to be causes for gratitude, in fact he is so obsessed with the imaginary p .. that Islam actually is an independent world state, and that Moslems can dictate British policy almost in the tone of conquerors, that he cannot hr iff himself to make the slightest concession or hold out any hope of actual f 1 • hi,, nnd lovaltv on the part of Moslems. V ,1 her he said that if Great Britain (lid not fall in with Moslem views .she would 'lay herself open to the great danger of a permanent alliance s. 25)u. J} 103between Moslem opinion and the great power of Germany which was the leading force in material and political science, which would survive the war no matter who won. . , i , i a i • i n i His ideal was that die Shenl should rnl&lt;^ over Arabia and all the conntrv south of the line Ma'arash, Diarbekir, Zakhn, Kowandnz, that the Arabian chiefs should each rule in his own district, and that Syria and Irak should be under constitutional governments, lie resolutely refused to entertain any idea of control or advisers with executive anthoritity of any kind. He held that the Arabs were more intelligent than Turks and that thev could easily manage their own affairs; no argument would move him on this point; the suggestion of partitition or annexation he countered by the statement that there were already German officers who had become Moslems, that more would do so, and that England would hardly dare annoy her numerous Moslem subjects in India and elsewhere. J understand that Shaykh Reshid Kida has no great personal following but that his ideas coincide with those of a considerable number of the Arab Ulema. It will be seen that it is quite impossible to come to any under standing with people who hold such views, and it may be suggested that against such a party force is the only argument that they can understand. My interviews lead me to believe that it is important that Great Ijritain and France should come to some understanding as soon as possible with regard to Syria. * » * «• As to the method to be adopted, 1 feel that the choice lies between Course A., Map 11, and Course !&gt;., Map IV. However, should Course D. be chosen certain important amendments are necessary to Schedule 1\ . 1. The declaration of the Independence of the Sherif. '2. The deletion of the Imperial army and fleet. •3. The establishment of an international board of control for the Imperial taxes. 1. The allocation of a tutelage power to each Ayalet with the exception of No. 1. i.e., Russia. 3. France. 4. Great Britain. 5. Great Britain. r&gt;. That in 3, 4, and 5 ; (a) The Governor-General should have an adviser-general.appointed by the tutelage power who should have the right of veto over any minister ; (6) 'That the provincial ministers of finance, justice, and the interior should have advisers appointed by the tutelage power. That these advisers should have executive authority, but act through their ministers as at present in Egypt, however, the minister should have power to ask the adviser-general to replace his adviser and in event of the adviser- general not concurring, that the existing c^tbinec should decide. 0. That the Cadis and Muftis should be appointed by the Sherif of Mecca. These suggestions seem to me essential in view of the want of coniidence of all in the power of the inhabitants of the regions to carry on a government unaided. It is also suggested that there should be some property qualifications for voters, in order to eliminate the disorderly town elements from elections, and to include the industrious peasant cultivators who are the most worthy but oppressed class. Before closing this despatch I feel that 1 should mention the fact that it would meet the aspirations of many, and solve future difficulties, if France were willing to forego her lights in Syria and would allow us to control Ayalet Xo. 3 in return for compensation elsewhere, and the cession to her of certain branches of industrial enterprise and railways in Syria.-1 lie three A valets could thfen be under the goverimieiit of the Sulrau of Lgypt and the spiritual dominion of the Sherif of Mecca. Worked as one unit these three regions are united by language and financially sell- supporting. 1 have, &amp;c., ^ 0 - Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, ^ ir » 2nd August 1915. In the following despatch I propose to give an analysis of certain intellectual forces at present developing in the Islamic world of the Near Kast, i.e., Kgypt, Arabia and the Ottoman Empire. The present war has struck the world at a time when Islam is in a period ot transition. 1 lie transition is not marked by the conflict of two or more theological and political schools with definite names, and consequently it is left rather to the observer to distinguish and group the different forms of thought for himself. Outwardly Sunni Islam is united, but internally it is divided, though the divisions are not openly hostile to one another. The line of cleavage may be described as that of the divergence between those who are chiefly influenced by the past on one hand and by European inclination on the other. It would, however, be entirely confusing to label these nameless parties Conservative and Liberal, or Progressive and Re actionary, since any such appellations would be entirely false—on the ancient side may bt; found the vital germs of later derelopments, systems of philosophy of the broadest and most advanced type —among the most violent and pronounced of the moderns, a savage unreasoning fanaticism of the most primitive nature. It is necessary to make this initial digression owing to the fact that the ancients and ijioderns (if a name may be given) are outwardly distinguishable by appearances, i.e., dress, custom, and manner of expression, which tend to give rise to a false impression to the superficial observer. Thus a young Turk may resemble the advanced politician of Europe or America, a follower of Hahai may appear to be a picturesque survival of the past, whereas fundamentaliy the young FurlvS ideas arc in no wise different from those of the Jannissaries of the loth century, while the turbaned philosopher would readily appreciate the theories of lolstoi or Mr. Hernard Shaw. Keeping to the names of ancients and moderns, but Curefullv eliminating any European analogies which the names may suggest, I venture to distinguish the various sub-divisions on both sides as follows Axciknts. Class I.—The first class on the ancient side may be justly described as orthodox. This type of mind is soaked in Mohammedan learning and prejudice; is hard, unyielding, bigoted and fanatical; desires no change, and is wedded to a close observance of formuhe and nice distinctions ol cleanliness of person and propriety of conduct. J he advance ol Europe has embittered these thinkers against Christians, till they are even more violent and sour in their sentiments against ('hristendom than their forefathers. The bi^st known type of this class is Sheikh Shawish. Class IE—The second class among the ancients are those who. while as meticulous and scrupulous in matters of form, belong to a type that Islam has alwavs known since the days of Abu Bekr, the first orthodox Caliph Tint is a type of mind which is generous, kindly, tolerant and hopeful, with a strict sense of dutv which is tempered by a profound sense of justice and devotion to religion which is divorced from political ambition lypical ol this is the late Sheikh Mohammed Abdu and the Grand Kadi of the Sudan. Class III —Though somewhat rarer than either of the preceding two, this class is not to be forgotten, and that is the body of educated Moslemswho, while devoted to the culture and habits of the past, are moving along the path of unorthodox mysticism, which knows no immutable formuhe nor restriction of thought. These may be recognised in persons like the Grand Shelabi of Konia, who is equally conversant with Oriental and Occidental ideas, or the Bahai whose teaching lias found some adherents in England and the United States. % Modekns. Class 1. The highest type among the moderns, is a person of good family who has entireh absorbed a Western education, and in the process has become, as far as supernatural affairs are concerned, an agnostic, and in mode of life a person who eats and dresses as an European. However, this class labours under a decided disadvantage in being mentally unable to absorb one of t he basic ideas of European civilisation, and that is the idea of nationalism. Having behind them centuries of Islamic tradition which knows politically neither colour, tongue, nor frontiers, members of this class are entirely baffled by the fumlamental notion which runs through all European teaching, which somehow connects past glories and wrongs with a real or imaginary combination of language and blood. Thus to preach nationalism to Bulgarians was easy enough ; though the Bulgarian people have a borrowed tongue, and are a mixture of autochthonous and invading peoples, a modicum of song, legend and fragmentary history was sufficient to revive or invent a nation which is now a grim reality. To a Moslem, be he Syrian, Egyptian, or Turk this is literally impossible; there is nothing real, conscious or sub-conscious, which responds to the call of nationalism as an European understands the word. However, though the real meaning of nationalism is literally incomprehensible and unappreciable, they accept the European idea of nationalism which underlies all European teaching and apply it inevitably to Islam ; that is to the misty political idea of a vague Caliphate vaguely ruling over a number of confederations of Moslems who form the dominant political force in the region they inhabit* whether in a majority or a minority. I have been obliged to elaborate this idea at some length owing to the fact that it governs all the actions and thoughts of those on the modern side. Class J., whose characteristics 1 have already summarised, apply the ideal of Nationalism to Islam on moderate and reasonable lines ; being already prosperous they desire no revolution, and where, as in Egypt, their majority is unchallengable, they are ready to work on strictly constitutional lines, to break up into parties and generally behave as if they were the inhabitants of an European State. However, it must always be remembered that such persons, no matter how similar to us in thought and carriage they may seem, are separated from us by an immense, if invisible gulf, and for the reasons above stated cannot spontaneously recognise Christians of their own tongue and blood as their co-nationalists, for though they no longer believe in the Prophet they still believe in the Muslemin. Class II.— The second among the moderns are the poor, incompetent, or criminal who have received an inferior European education, and whose minds by circumstance or temperament, or both, are driven into more sinister channels than the first class. Just as the members of Class I. apply the catch words, phrases, and machinery of European Nationalist Liberalism to Islam, so do Class 11. apply the methods and violence of European Jacobinism, Nihilism, Revolutionary Socialism and Anarchism to the body politic of Sunni Mahommedanism, their position is mentally less confused than Class I. for they have taken a cosmopolitan European doctrine and applied it to an international religious organisation. Members of this class inevitably drift towards the Committee of Union and Progress or its kindred or affiliated revolutionary societies. In office their methods are those of the French Commune, when out of office those of Havachol. They combine the fanaticism of Islam with the desperate ideas of International Anarchy. In theory they are atheists, but in practice they are Ghazis or Fedais. Inconsidering tliis cla.ss it is well to remember that in the middle Orient, secret societies of political assassins are of ancient date; in IIUOad . the devotees of the Old Man of the Mountain made his power felt equally in the courts of Christendom and Islam. Having analysed the main components of Islamic thought in the Near East, it is well to point out that there are innumerable links in both the ancient and modern chains. 1 he cl isses described are stages in the scale of mentality ami between each one there are a variety of compromises. It now remains to consider two fundamental bonds of an accidental nature which att'ect various sections of the people. The Asiatic Arab Moslems have a strong bond of union in th^ir language, and a certain moral superiority owing to their language being that of the Koran. An Arab always will give precedence to an Arab over another Moslem, and, further, Arabs as a whole regard themselves as the aristocracy of Islam, since practically all the noble and sacred houses are of Arab or pseudo-Arab descent. The Ottoman Turks owing to the prestige of th&lt;' Ottoman dynasty have the sense of material superiority, the superiority of physical force ; between the two there is a silent rivalry and antipathy. Though each admits tacitly the other's claims. The above fact is mentioned here for it must ever be borne in mind that the Turkish sense of physical dominion is common to every class of Turk, while the Arab's sense of superiority uf breed is never absent from the Arab's mind. Lastly, it must be remembered that the vast uneducated Moslem masses are entire strangers to the distinctions which separate these nameless schools of thought, but are always susceptible to outbursts of fanatical rage, and can always be relied upon when inspired by official or semi-ollicial promptings to rise in riot and disorder in the name of religion, providing that the machinery of retribution is not visible and at hand. In the problems which His Majesty's Government is now facing in the Levant, Egypt, Arabia and Irak, the above factors, racial and spiritual will doubtless play a cons'derable part, and in deciding on a policy it might be profitable to examine the way in which the various influences work. In Egypt we have on the side of the ancients to face the absolute hostilitv of Class 1. who seem to have captured the pan-Arab niovement, the benevoient apathy of Class II., and the mild approval of Class III. who have hardly any influence. As regards the moderns we have the constitutional opposition of Class L which is large, and the unforgiving enmity of Class 11. which is subject to the influence of the Committee of Union and Progress. On the Western desert side we have the Senussi, a niovement which lies somewhere between Classes 1. and 11. (ancient), but is falling under the gradually increasing influence of Class 11. (modern). It may here be pointed out that as in other political struggles extremes sometimes meet, and the modern anarchist Moslem is often in alliance with the fanatic of the old school, the bond of hatred of Christendom being suflicient to blind the adherents of each cause to the incongruity of the unbending dogmatism of the one with the aggressive Ireethinking of the othei. In Svria it may be assumed that the case is somewhat different Classes II . ancient) and I (modern) are probably more favourably disposed to us th in in Eoypt and Class II. (modern) is rare owing to the antipathy between \ribs and Turks and the good influence of the French Jesuit and American Colleges at Beirut, though it may be noted that the latter institution has of late lost somewhat in discipline and moral The anti -Christian and violent element in Syria will therefore lie chiefly with Class I (ancient), who will be indirectly influenced by the subterranean intrigues of the Young Turks at Constantinople. In Anatolia and Constantinople the Committee which is Class 11 /modern) is in the complete ascendant and holds all other schools of thought u absolute servitude, though there is this distinction to be considered, the violent Class 1. (ancient) is almost non-existent, ami if the \ oung ui's were eliminated Class II. and 111. (ancient) would be found to be in great strength. 1 lowever, the slow -moving Turkish intellect and the innate 1 urkish S. 29('. , 4•i ..wtnl-pn for philosophic calm makes this class and H «m only bo reokoned on as a sort of 1^. is the country lying. with and wdl mcluik , • hitherto had considerable opportunities beys and religious chiefs, who have nitneifo^ ^ ^ 8t . mulated to ()£ S'V 1 ? 67 ' 1 ? 3 ; '[''if , loss.'

(ancient who are niMirectly stimulated by the distant Committee will bo the hostile force. In considering this problem it will be seen that J the above anaUsis is correct (and I feel some confidence that it is) our policy towards islam may fall into a definite line. As regards Class I. (ancient) 1 feel that it is quite useless to endeavour to soothe or gentle it: we need only be careful never to give it a just cause for complaint, and when its members complain that British and other Christian missionaries cause adultery and usury, or make similar insolent representations, give them a short and unfriendly answer. In Class 11, (ancient) lies our greatest hope, and if by wise and tactf ul methods we can increase its power and obtain its active support, much will be done to ensure the peace not only of our own borders but ul mankind as a whole. The A1 Azhar and the Government of Mecca, which at present both lean in this direction, with sympathisers among the. I lema in Syria, Anatolia, and Irak, could practically sway the whole tendency of ancient Islam thought and curb the unformed masses of peasant, and urban, and nomadic population. As far as the moderns are concerned, it is manifest that Class 1. is the only real force that can counteract permanently the efforts and control the radius of influence of Class 11., which, 1 believe, we shall always have with us. The method to be pursued which suggests itself to me is that we should be prepared to make concessions to this class, no matter how unpalatable, so long as we in no way compromise the fundamental principles of justice in regard to the treatment of Christian and mystic minorities, the financial probity of the administration and the checking of intimidation by notables or clubs of anarchists and fanatics \\ ith regard to Class 111. (ancient) we should do well to watch develop ments in this direction, and in event of the arising of a new religious cult he prepared to prevent its persecution, since it is little likely that the next phase of religious development will be in the direction of violence and austerity, such as the W ahabi or Senussi movements, but more probably in the direction of mysticism and pacificism, as instanced in the developments of Babism and Bahaism. i hese developments will not in all probability have any influence in Arabia proper, but may grow where the pure Semitic blood is mixed with Iranian and other elements in Irak, Svna, and Mesopotamia. In conclusion, 1 should like to mention that in the above despatch 1 have omitted as much detail as was possible in order to give the outlines of acoherent general polic3 T with regard to Islam in the Near East. 1 am unacquainted with the slage of Indian Mohaminedanism, but I think the suggestions included in this despatch might be of interest to the India OfHee. I have, &amp;(*., Major-( ieneral K. C. Callwell, Director of Military Operations, War Ofiice. No. 19 (Secret). Aden, Sir, 10th August 11)1'). In the following despatch 1 have tlie honour to give the results of various conversations with the further persons whom the High .Commissioner recommended me to see in connection with the situation in Turkey. S v'ad P. Z. vglool. I had two interviews with I lis Excellency Sa ad J'. Zaglool, who is still regarded as the leader of constitutional opposition. Sa'ad P. Zaglool, in the course of many observations, expressed tlie opinion that to those of advanced views the declaration of a Protectorate had come as a disheartening blow, inasmuch as it put an end to the theory that the occupation was not a permanent institution. He, however, agreed that the idea, of an absolutely independent Egypt was not one which could be entertained, and that for purposes of defence, tinance, and foreign relations Egypt must always depend on some other Power. With regard to the position of the Sultan and the want of moral sanction to his title' with its effect on the people, he considered that the popular attitude was inevitable but nevertheless bad for Egypt. He cited the attitude of the people iu the Mosques who inevitably give a loud ' Amen when the prayer is raised for the Caliph, but remain silent when prayer is uttered for the Sultan. This weekly demonstration of passive ill-will be considered demoralising and of ill-omen for the future. In replv to a question as to how this could be ameliorated, Sa'ad P. /•wrliHil referred to tlie likelihood of a change of Caliphate and the possibility of a proper investiture which would go some way towards putung 'iongs on •i boner footing. As was natural in one in bis position, he coiisidered aU' tli it if the Sultan could announce an extension of the power ol the Chamber, and the initiation of something approaching local autonomy in matters whic concerned native affairs alone, would have an improving effect. )n t subiect be seemed to regard Caisse de k Dette, Suez Canal, nuxed court , r-n itulations Ando-Sudanese administration, the arm}, and loieigu iclations S'bS'; Chunher's powers as far as legislation or executive control were rum-oniccl. iu this lna ,.ter (o hold moderate views, and it i the existence of a Chamber with purely consultative v- - become tUe pro bable Imperial Conference that would take Sa ad I asna men appeared attracted by the idea of the Egyptian place at tae ( i.; « j j t H,. s aid that this had two meanings, one that ( hamber * n ' 11 '\.^..

As regards the present crisis in the Mohammedan world he said that a change ot Caliphate was essential to peace, and he seemed to anticipate the advent of the Sherif of Mecca. However, he further expressed the opinion that the greatest danger at present arose from the evil influence of quasi- European education on the student clas-s. He cited the fact that English University teaching had had a completely demoralising eflect on both Egyptian and Indian Moslems he had known, making them violent and discontented, and tilling them with destructive notions. He thought that if the Al Azhar University v as developed and reformed, it might prove a great moderating influence in the Islamic world ; he admitted that it was natural that in such an institution there should be many schools of thought among its members, some ol whom were entirely opposed to British policv, but on ihe other hand he considered that it did not produce that virulent type of anarchist which so often results from alien teaching. He also laid stress on the world wide influence of the Al Azhar, and the fact thai in composition it was practically international, and thai if it continued to flourish, and worked on-sound lines it might do much to stabilise Mohammedan thought in India and elsewhere. As an example in support of Shaykh JShakir's views I might cite a pamphlet written by Shaykh M. El Kalkali, a Syrian graduate of the Azhar, a translation of the preface to which 1 enclose. The preface in itself shows the lines on which an Anglo-phil Moslem thinks, and doubtless reflects the feelings and views of many, but it would be almost impossible for a man who had received a quasi-European education or had only been to an English university to think or write in this particular way. Peke Jaussen .—Syrian Arabs, Northern Arabia— I was advised by Colonel Clayton to see Pere Jaussen, the French Dominican archaeologist, who has acted as our intelligence officer with the North Red Sea patrols under Admiral Peirce. It was arranged that in order to obtain a complete exchange of ideas that Pere Jaussen should accompany me as far as Aden, where he could make himself familiar with the situation there, a knowledge of which would be of' value to him in his work in North-West Arabia. The Arab situation from the Hauran to Jeddah, Pere Jaussen describes as follows :— The Druses, Beni Sachr, Howeytat, Mejali of Kerak, and Ben Atiyeh are anti-Turkish, and are only biding their time. The Circassian settlers and the people of Nablus and Hebron are pro-Turkish for fanatical reasons; the followers of Ibn Kashid who extend from Jouf to Teyma are pro-Turkish and anti-Entente, the tribes under the influence of the Sherif are anti- Turkish. Pere Jaussen considers that once the Turks are disposed of, the Sherif has nothing to fear from Ibn Reshid, owing to his superiority of position, the numbers of his adherents, and his own personal capacity which is much greater than that of any of his opponents. It will thus be seen that the events of the war have not changed the general life of politics in Syria and North-West Arabia, whichst and much as they stood lU years ago. With regard to future policy it is very important that we should come to an agreement with France in Palestine. In event of the fall of Constanti nople it should not be difficult to place ourselves in a very favourable position in Syria, south of the red line marked on Map V., report of the Departmental Committee, to start negotiations for the establishment of an independent Arabia, and to begin to get into touch with the forces of Ibn Sand from the north-west and so establish communication between the troops in Mesopotamia and Egypt.13 So long as our position in regard to France is doubtful practically nothing can be done, and I feel personally that there is a danger that anarchy may supervene before a new or temporary government can be established, the consequence of which may mean an unnecessary expenditure' of men and material, besides damaging the material prosperity of those regions, the development of which may be expected to recoup the Allies in some degree for a part of the charges of the war. From a political point of' view it is especially important that we should risk as little fighting as possible against those who will some day become our proteges or subjects, and that our penetration should be rather as a friendly than a hostile power; however, to achieve this we must have a clear understanding with France and be ready to take immediate advantage of any favourable circumstances in the area mentioned. I have, &amp;c.,11 T E \j E G \\ A M S. (1) 19th November. -Following for D.M.O. from Mark Sykes, No. 18 : I am waiting here for opportunity of seeing (ieneral &lt; )fficer ( ommandinp, and High Commissioner in accordance with your instructions. By favour of Cheetham 1 have seen correspondence relating to Arab movement and Sherif. Two difficulties strike me : (a) Arab want of confidence in our might. {h) Difficulty of making arrangements with Arabs inoffensive to French susceptibilities, based on financial interests and historic sentiment. I suggest as means ol coping with diiliculty id) that we block ^ ilician Gates, or deny Turkish access to Syria via Adana Tlain, as first step. As second step, occupy line Aintab, Birijik, Suverek, Diarbekir, and establish touch with Russians while Turkish and German masses are immobilised by the Anatolian and Armenian winter snow, leaving Arabs to do as they please south of this line. Details of this scheme and quantity of troops required should reach you by 24th instant. Difficulty (b) could be coped with as follows :— Entente to agree with Arabs to recognise, respect, and protect Arab provisional government or governments in the vilayets of Beyrout, Aleppo, Damascus, Jerusalem, and lledjaz, and sanjaks of Derzor and 1 rfa during the war, and to guarantee above areas as minimum of independent Arab territory after tlie war in excess of Arabia proper. Arabs to engage not to grant concessions directly or indirectly to financial groups of central Powers for a period of 25 years, nor to establish diplomatic relations with them for a period of 10 yeers. Great Britain, Russia, and Italy to engage not to obtain concessions in vilayets ol Aleppo, Heyrout, Damasen^ or sanjaks of Urfa without approval of French Government, and to recognise the spirit of previous agreements between French Government and Ottoman Govern ment with regard to educational establishment in same area in suggested Arab independent State or States. I further suggest that vilayets of Bagdad and Basra are incapable of self-government, and a new and weak state could not administer them owing to Shia and Sunni dissension. We might agree with Arabs to administer these provinces on their behalf, allocating certain revenues to their exchequer or exchequers, this corresponding to their demand for subsidy, and further agreeing that, in the event of the population of the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra not producing a sufficient number for administrative personnel under British supervision, delicit will be made good from Arab state or states. 1 make these suggestions because I believe that the situation is critical. 1 feel that Arab nationalism, as such, presents no danger to India now or in the future, unless we confine ourselves to ('anal defensive and let Turk and German masses assemble in Syria and north Mesopotamia, re-establish their prestige, and so work a real Jehad with Arab support. This would entail strong repercussion in north Africa, both French and Italian, as well as in Persia, Caucasus, and Afghanistan, eventually engrossing a larger force of Entente troops, under less favourable circumstances than at present. I submit that Russia, Italy, and France are all directly affected by this situation. At present the Arabs are anti-Turkish, and the Taurus and Armenian snow hampers our enemies movements. 1 therefore believe that now is our only chance of foiling the German plan of involving all the Entente Powers in defensive operations against Islam. (2) 21st November. Following for D.M.O. No. 19 :— Your private letter of . r )th November just received. Previous to getting it 1 saw Faruki iiey and anticipating French difficulty, discussed situation with him with that in view. Following is best I could get, but seems to me15 to meet situation both as regards France and Great Britain. Arabs would agree to accept as approximate northern frontier Alexandretta Aintab- Uerijik-l rfa-Midiyat-Zakho-Rowanduz. Arabs would iigree to convention with France, granting her a monopoly of aJl concessionary enterprise in Syria and Palestine, Syria being delined ab bounded by Euphrates as far south as l)eir Zor and from thence to Deraa, and along Hejaz railway to Ma'an. llejaz railway as far south as Amman could be sold to French conces sionaires. Arabs would further agree to employ none but Frenchmen as advisers, and European employees in this area. Note Arabs will not under take to employ Europeans if they eau do without them, but Faruki points out that this stipulation is to avoid any shadow of control. Arabs would agree to all French educational establishments having special recognition in this area. Arabs would agree to an identical convention with Great Britain as regards the remainder of greater Arabia, viz., Irak and Jazirah, and North Mesopotamia. Further, Arabs would agree to any territory north of the greater Arabian frontier being French possessions under the French Hag. Arabs would agree to Basra town and all cultivated lands to the south being British territory. Arabs would be prepared to make a treaty with the Entente Powers: — (L) Undertaking on their part to have no diplomatic relations with Turkey-Germany or Austria for a period of 15 years. (2) On part of Entente Powers to guarantee to protect independence of Arabs. Further, a treaty of alliance with Entente Powers giving them freedom of movement in Greater Arabia, and use of railways in Arabian area for duration of war. Entente troops in Arab territories to be on same footing as British troops in Flanders. Entente troops to evacuate territories on cessation of hostilities. Faruki insisted that this was dependent on Entente landing at a point between Mersina and Alexandretta, and making good Amanus pass or Cilician Gates. He further stipulated that Sherif should not take action until this had been done. 1 agree that any other course is out of the uuestion, and that to call on Sherif or Arabs to take action until we had made aforesaid passes secure would be impossible. Faruki also urged the necessity of immediate and adequate action in Governor of Alexandretta, adding 'that if Entente did not take this opportunity Germans would fore stall them, and once Turks or Germans got into Syria, Arabs would in their own interests be obliged to reconsider situation. For my own part 1 am sure there can be no idea of Arabs merely troubling Turks m an advance on the ( anal If we allow Turks into Syria Arabs will side with them m order to obtain special consideration, Germans having already suggested the idea of Turco -Arabia on the same lines as Austria-Ilungary. 1 will crive observations on less important aspects in a further telegram. Meanwhile, 1 am convinced of necessity of efficient action at earliest possible moment to enable Arabs to move. (3) 21st November.— Following for D.M.O. from Mark Sykes No. 20. In continuation of my No. 19 on hypothesis that Faruki's interview is ha^is of our arrangement with Arabs, 1 submit— Tl \s regards France and Arabs, our task is to get Arabs to concede as much as possible to the French, and to get our Haiffa outlet and I alestine ncluded in our sphere of enterprise in the form of a French concession to us Thus we smooth the way for France with the Syrians and in a matter where France has a traditional interest, deal directlv with hei. Note -Arabs will always welcome any extension of our sphere i&gt;l regards Arabia proper, I do not think proposed Arab movement in rptrard to our various Gult and Red Sea interests, r if Jen ' Veaties wTll hold soo .l ami F am confident that the suzerainty 3 the Sherif m Arabia Proper will in practice be purely honorary. £ S. 290.16 (3) As regards uur position in Irak, our established civil government must hold for the duration of the war and we should stipulate for this. Bagdad and Basra provinces are divided from Vrabia by schism and are too disorderly and rancorous for a uew -l&gt;oru state to govern. W hen time for evacuation comes, Sherii's government will have to face the Shiah and Kerbela question, and I anticipate will be glad enough to get us to run the administration for them for some time to come in order to get revenue. Arab nationalism has little influence and Khaliphate none, south of Bagdad, in cultivated area. (4) I submit for strategic and political consideration of India that suggested Arab state cannot become a formidable power in itself so long as it is protected from German and Turkish influence by'France and ourselves. (o) 1 anticipate in event of our giving the Arabs their opportunity that matters will shape themselves as follows :—The influx of trade and monev owing to the opening of the Syrian ports will keep thingn quiet in Syria and Palestine, and government will be carried on on Turkish formula' with local personnel. Bagdad and Basra provinces will continue to accept our provisional rule without demur. The Government of Mosul and I'rfa will be disorderly, and Arab state will probably have to ask for our assistance. The Arabs of northern Arabia Proper will light indecisively among themselves. (6) In event of our letting this opportunity go, the Arabs in Syria and north Mesopotamia will, I believe, delinitely fall in with the Turks in order to get best terms for nationalist aspirations from those whom they would then regard as certain winners. ! 1) For D.M.O., from Mark Sykes.
