As I was planning to think things over for a few days anyway before I sent a return wire, I am ^.king this opportunity of answering by letter instead, as I believe a boat is due in the near future. I found some odds and ends of universal joints of Chevrolets of an earlier vintage and with them repaired our own so that the car is running again, although I do not know ^or how long. The strange parts were much too big t*or the space in which they had to work, and the question was how much metal I could take o^f with out weakening them too much. It seems to work well just now, but I am not too sure how it would last on a trip up the coast. Ad as wo really cannot live and work here without the use of the car, expciall in ^ summer when the Gharbis and the Suris blow, I think you had better purchase the universal joint for the Chevrolet Standard 1936, and collect from Mr. Van peursem. I have just written him to that effect. Send it along as soon as you have a trustworthy way o^ sending it. I think the only sure way will H. M.’s mail bag. This is a big sum to ray, but taxis are also^ out of the question, as a round trip to Saham would cost about 8s. 500/0. Our mutual friend Syyid Famed bin Famed is feeling quite fit. Fe is trying to get a battery for car and radio. Mrs. Dykstra joins in sending many salaams. /fc /iHSbOmtr No #l» -16/57 POLITICAL AGKNCY, BAHRAIN.

Galloway, O.B.E., H.B.M.’s Political Agent, The Agency, MANAMA. Bahrain Rece’pt Nt ,7.5/ ?... Dati yM ^ cy Dear Colonel Galloway, I have received your letter No. D.0.756-16/57 dated 5th March, 1946 with regard to oil used on roads. Slop oil is low grade oil recovered from our separators and contains a certain quantity of oil/water emulsion and sediment. This oil is used, not because it is the best oil for roads, but because it is the cheapest and using it on the roads is a handy way of disposing of it. We have a limited production of this oil and about enough to keep our roads oiled. We have found that repeated applications of this slop oil to a road surface, together with occasional grading with a road grader, results finally in a fairly satisfactory road surface. We have tried it on sandy stretches with fairly satisfactory results, provided enough applications are made. We have used this slop oil on the roads maintained by the Bahrein Government on several occasions and have charged a price of 10 annas per barrel, which is about sufficient to recover the Royalty paid by the Company. This price is based on delivery ex the Refinery, all charges for transportation, etc., for the consumer's account. Muscat, it is fairly evident that the main item of expense is going to be the transportation of the oil to Muscat and landing and handling there, etc. The petroleum product used would undoubtedly have to be transported in drums. It Is a fairly safe assumption that the cost of the actual oil would be a fractional amount of the total cost and in view of this it would appear more economical to use a petroleum product more suitable for roads, for instance, bitumen or asphalt. The incremental increase in cost would be small and since bitumen or asphalt would do a much better job, the overall cost would probably be less. at Bahrein but have plans underway whereby asphalt manufacturing facilities will be installed within the next year and some We use slop oil on the roads herein Bahrein. In considering the problem of oiling roads at We do not at the present time manufacture asphalt2 7th March, 1946. time in 1947 we should be able to supply a very satisfactory grade of asphalt in drums suitable for road making. If there are any other questions not covered in the above, please feel free to ask them and we will endeavour to give you whatever additional information you may require.
