I quite agree that Minister’s arguments have weight* At the same time, if visit of Persian warship is made to Shaikh’s territory without notification, which is contingency I have in mind, then Persian Government have ipso facto disregarded independence of Shaikh concerned and I do not think that a ceremonaJ&amp;L call on Ruler, such as might be paid by Persian representatives on a Persian Governor or notable in a Persian port, would make up for non-notification, while the acceptance of such a call by the Ruler would surely feondone the non-notification and weaken any subsequent protest.

In ^ he case of Bahrain H.M*s.

Government considers it desirable that Shaikh should afford usual courtesies unless the attendanti attendant cirpmcastances are quite exceptional, e*g* dis- -courtesies to harbour officials or acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations* Ihe^are prepared to leave to the Political Agent’ ;&gt; discretion to act in the light of his estimate of the circumstances* In the event of call following xhxxk an un-notified visit being accepted end passing without incident immediate formal protest rfould be laade at Tehran* 4* As regards contingency id) Government suggest that in the event of Persians sending armed party to land at Bahrain the party should be met at pier by (preferably) European representative of Shaikh ( e*g* Belgrrve) by whom they should be informed on behalf of Shaikh that His Excellency could not agree to party land- -ing with arms but that no objection would kMM be seen to their landing without arms for purpose of purchasing provisions, etc. 5. If in light of communication of this nature, Persians were nevertheless to land with arms question of employment of force would depend on their attitude and actual proceedings. Clearly they could not be allowed to behave in such a manner as to undermine the authority of the Shaikh or our prestige in the eyes of the populat- -ion. But question whether aic and at what point Politic -al Agent should advise intervention of Bahrain police force must be left to his discretion if and when such a situation should arise. If intervention did become necessary, our position would have been strengthened by communic' tion made to landing party at the commencehjent and onus of aggression would rest on the Persians. 6. Risk of attempted armed landing is probably serious only at Bahrain, but similar action to that ■ P' - suggested above might also be taken in the event of landing at Kuwait or Muscat. As regards Trucial Coast we'J we shall probably have to take our chance and protest immediately on behalf of the .ihaikhs affected. 7.

But immediate report should be sent in event of any action of this nature by Persian Havy with a view to necessary steps being taken. 8. H.M's.

It might be as well, if this can be done without attracting undue attention, to ensure so far as possible that on other inhabited islands belonging to or claimed by Arab rulers wMm* mmmmmM mmm - Trucial or other appropriate Arab flag is also kept flying.

(b) A Party will be landed to purchase provisions etcetera. (c) An attempt may be made to pay a ceremonial visit on His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalirah.

If any of the above events should take place,the following course of action should be adopted,unless there are special considerations necessitating a modification:- (a) when no Party is landed,no action on the part of the State is necessary.except a formal protest by liis Excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent against the unnotified visit. (b) A Party may be allowed to land to uurchase provisions etcetera,but a formal protest should immediately be made by ills excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent,against the unnotified visit oi the warship. (c) Should the Officer Commanding a Persian Aarshio express a desire to pay a ceremonial visit on His Excellency the Shaikh,it would seem best that His excellency the Shaikh should (after consultation with the Political Agent} follow the normal inter national practice on the occasion of an unnotilled visit of a foreign ,arship to a Port; that is to say,that he should receive the call in spite of the omission of the Persian Government to give him previous notification. It will be well ior His excellency the Shaikh to take an opportunity during the call of mentioning that he wished to have previous notification of such visits. In the event,however,of there being attendant circumstances of an exceptional nature,such as acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations or discourtesies to Harbour Officials by Officers or men of the Ship, it would be necessary to consider in the light ol uhe actual circumstances,wnether or not the call should be accepted. in the event of the call being accepted and passing without incident,an immediate formal protest should'be made by His excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent.(dj In the event of an krined Party being landed, the Party should be met at the Pier by a State Official (preferably an huropean;the Financial Adviser,if possible; and informed on behalf of the Ruler that His Excellency couia not agree to a Party landing with &gt; arms ? but there would be no objection to their landing without arms for the purpose of purchasing provisions etcetera. Should no attention be paid to itetK this warning of the State Official tne Political Agent has been authorized to consider whether,and at what stage,he should advise the intervention of the Bahrain Police Force. 3d/- G.Loch, Lieut Colonel.

The Hon 1 hie the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, B IT S H I R B . ^ Hauling do^m of British Flag by Persian Warship at Bassidu” . Sir, I have the honour to report that on Saturday Sunday and Monday the 26th, 27th and 28th August respec tively , there were strong rumours in the Kuwait bazaar of an incident having taken place at British Bassidu, in which the Persian Navy had insulted the British Flag* 2* It was stated that a Persian Warship had landed a party and had hauled down the Union Waok which it flies permanently there, and had torn/into fragments. 5. Further that the said party before leaving hoiked the Persian flag but that a British Warship had then come on the scenes and rehoisted the Union Jack and driven the Persian ship away, 4. I asked His Kjccelleney the Shaikh on Saturday night if he had heard anything about the rumour and he said he had, also that it was having a very disturbing effect in the Town. People, he said, were wondering what action British Government would take in the matter, for if the story was true, a grave and deliberate insult appeared to have been committed. 8jl mtmm* (2 )&lt; 5, On Sunday the 27th the ShaiKli mentioned the incident to Mr. Chisholm of the A.P.O.C., who had called on him in connection with some business matters, and asked for latest news. Mr. Chisholm reported this to me and I understood from him that the Shaikh was quite out spoken abfcut the bad effect all along the Arab side, such news would have. 6. On Tuesday the 29th August H.M.S. w Bideford” arrived at Kuwait, and her Captain communicated to me the true version of the story, which did not differ much from the rumour. 7, In order to allay the Shaikh’s anxiety, and reassure the public, I called on the Shaikh on my return from H.M.S# ”Bideford”, and told him what I had heard was the correct version. I added that strong representations had already been made to Tehran. 8. It may interest you to know that such incidents as the above have immediate repurcussions in a place like Kuwait, for the Persians are looked upon as being such utterly irresponsible beings, as to be quite capable of appearing before Kuwait and bombarding the place. The people well know that the British Navy today stands between the Persians and themselves, but to give them the fullest confidence, they want to hear of swift action on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and see i mediate results in such and similar cases to the on© reported above. It is long drawn negotiations with apparently no results which do such harm where Arab friends are concerned.X 3 Telegram G-.T.C. From Resident, Bus’nire.

His Excellency the Viceroy reminded you of the state of these Seas in the olden times, when there was constant trouble and disturbances in the Persian Gulf, when almost every man was a marauder or pirate; kidnapping and slave trading/tradir. g flourished; fighting end bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put to sea without fear of attack; the pearl fishery was the scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace there was none. 'hen the 'Rri ti sh Government intervened, and British Warships and Briti sh forces compelled peace and created order on the Seas a There followed a series of maritime truces, which led to the 'reaty of Perpetual JPeace, and to other 'reaties between you.

Brom time to time fresh 'reaties have been made between you, Chiefs, and the British Government, and always have we carefully preserved and increased the ancient friendship between us — and we shall not allow these things to pass. Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by vour own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, the:'© grew up political ties between the British Govern men t and your selves, an?, the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Bower.

He was received with great kindness and friend -liness (which indeed he deserved) by both His Excellency the Senior Naval Officer and the Officer Commanding the Flotilla. After receiving the general salute, the Amir inspected the guard of honour, which was drawn up for the occasion, and then carefully visited the whole ship, attentively examining the various parts (machinery). He was able to observe to what extent of efficiency a modern navy has reached. He then retired to the stateroom, where he took some refreshment.

The two main issues discussed are whether Arab rulers in the Gulf should be formally notified prior to any visits to their ports by Persian warships, and, in cases where notification has not been received, whether a call to visit should be accepted. Much of the file consists of copies of telegrams relating to this matter between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department, and the British Minister, Tehran. Other correspondents include the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Foreign Office; the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf; the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ].Other matters discussed in the file include: a reported incident of an officer of a Persian warship hauling down a British flag at Basidu [Bāsaʻīdū]; a subsequent tour of the Gulf by a flotilla of eight British destroyers, and its perceived effect on opinion in Kuwait.The file also includes a copy of an address, given by the Political Resident to the Trucial Chiefs [rulers of the Trucial states] at Dibai [Dubai], on 23 September 1933.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><subject><topic>Warships</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
