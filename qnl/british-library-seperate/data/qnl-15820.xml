                           thawb, dark waistcoat with a metal hoop hanging from the right side and patterned turban; a white turban, dark jacket and white
                           thawbover checked sarong; a white
                           thawbover white trousers and dark turban; a white
                           thawbover white trousers and patterned turban; a white jacket over a checked sarong and white trousers. The man to the far left, the man second from right and the man third from right hold pieces of paper or booklets in their hands. The man second from left holds a scroll in his left hand as well as a dark-coloured umbrella. The man second from right, too, holds a dark umbrella.The Meccan woman wears a mid-coloured dress, perhaps of silk, with white decorative cuffs, with a white striped waistcoat over it and a patterned turban. The waistcoat appears to have two metal hoops on either side of her waist sewn into it. On her feet she wears shoes. The group are photographed in a courtyard-like space with plants – some in wide wooden pots – foliage and a window, fronted by bars, visible in the background.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded paint-like quality in places.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXXPrinted beneath image, in ink:'Pilger aus Ambon, Kei und Banda. links der Sohn eines Ambonesen mit einer Mekkanerin.’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower left corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000031#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
