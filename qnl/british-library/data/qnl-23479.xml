BAHRAIN: 12th May, 1934., 27th Muhurrum, 1353., I enclose herewith for your information a Notice which it is proposed to published on the 30th Mahurrum. &amp; The effect of the notice is that Customs documents covering imports and exports will be prepared at the Custom House by Bill-writers who will be paid by the Customs for such service. This new section of Customs work will be carried out by three young men from the local Government school, having colloquial knowledge of Persian and English, in addition to their native Arabic, under the supervision of Mr Ghulam Nabi, who comes from Lahore, and is well acquainted with various Indian languages, in addition to a colloquial knowledge of Arabic and Persian. The present system of muqqudamage will cease on the 30th Muhurrum. The persons who will be chiefly effected by this new arrangement will be the Nukhudhas of native craft that ply between Bahrain and Persian Gulf Ports, and also Karachi. It is hoped that the affixing of Revenue stamps upon the Bills (which is in effect the fee for the Bill-writing) will in time induce the illiterate Nukhudhas to understand how the local Customs dues are levied, so that they may become less dependent upon-the brokers who conduct their local sales for them. I should be glad to be favoured with your comments, please. Enclos: DIRECTOR OF and PORT OFFICER.

M*s Political JLgent, BAHrain Sir, 2 7 MAY 1935 In reply to your memorandum No*871-7-’ the 18th May, 1935, I have the honour to report that the present bill-writing system which was substituted for the Muqaddams system has greatly facilitated the clearance of cargo from the Custom House since it has been introduced, and it appears that both the local merchants and the nakhudhas of foreign craft are satisfied with the exisiting system of bill-writing. B/- I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant,I understand that about five years ago the local customs authorities withdrew all licences granted to customs clearing agents, and permitted only two persons to do such work; one is a Hindu who acts on behalf of Hindu merchants and the other is a local Arab who acts on behalf of Arab, Persian and all other merchants and boatmen. This latter gentleman is said to be a half-witted Mullah who is not fit for such work but for the monopoly which he thus holds. Nakhudas of ^hjgrh -boats which have finished loading^are ready to sail have to remain for a week or more spending a considerable percentage of the freight earned on food for the crew and other expences before they could get their papers cleared (it normally takes less than an hour to do this work), just because the Mullah is unable to coupe with the large amount of which he had to deal with. It is however open to merchants to employ their own clerks for clearing work but only a few of the bigger merchants t a ke # advantage of this as few can afford to employ special clerks to do this work for them. and0.0.

I would thank you for your D.O.No.152 of the 22-1-41. and, as explained in our conversation of yesterday, the ddvance in local education has enabled the majority of local merchants to effect their own Customs clearances without employing a licensed muqqadam. Some years ago a Customs Clearing Section was formed, to render free service to the public in preparing the necessary forms. These developments rendered unnecessary the licensing of a number of Clearing Agents. One licensed muqqadam, Muhummad Mutawa, is retained, who clears for the Government departments, and also the illiterate nukhudhas of country craft. He bears a good reputestionand only on very rare occasions have 1 found it necessary to shake him up. I have always felt strongly that the illiterate nuknudha is just as entitled to prompt attention as the literate merchant; and for this reason, I very much appreciate your remarks. If any instance of 'holding-up* clearances by Customs subordinates should come to your knowledge, I feel sure that you will kindly inform me, and it will be dealt with personally, because I feel that edgitry craft traffic should be encouraged as much as possible, and the nukhudhas assisted in their movements.
