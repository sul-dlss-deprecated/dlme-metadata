Disputes have risen in country within easy reach of Aden, as to the geography of which we have comparatively full information, where we have been acting with the co-operation of the Sheikh of the chief tribe concerned and where our Commission has had the support of an overwhelming military It is impossible not to feel anxiety as to the situation which might be created when similar disputes arise in the course of the delimitation to the desert, in quite unknown country, where the attitude of the tribes is doubtful, and where communications with our base will be difficult. His Majesty’s Government think it necessary, therefore, to consider whether it is prudent, in the circumstances, to proceed with the delimitation to the desert. The work would be prolonged, and the consequences of a collision The demarcation of the frontier up to the point at which the green line stops will settle the immediate cause of difficulty with Turks. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are inclined not to insist on the delimitation being carried out to the desert at once, but to offer to the Porte to postpone the further delimitation of the territory of the nine tribes, if the Turkish Government, on their part, will give an undertaking not to interfere with the Upper Yaffai and other tribes under our protection. Please let me have your views. serious.From Viceroy y Idth May 1903. {Repeated to Resident, Aden.) Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 16th May. Aden. Delimitation to north-east was first ordered hy yonr Lordship, without reference to us, m your telegram of the 19th July 1902; we have never been in favour ot proceeding with it until treaties had been made with the tribes in that direction ; this was refused hy His Majesty’s Government last year, and has only ]ust been conceded. Until we have concluded these treaties and have learnt something more definite about the tribes and country in that quarter, we think that the demarcation had better be postponed. Resident is of same opinion. In order, however, to avoid complete breakdown of operations, for which Turks are probably scheming, it might be well to take up demarcation of boundary down to the coast at Turba as soon as the Amiri border has been settled. If you concur, our garrison will of course remain at Dthali.From Resident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India 24ith November 1903. * {Repeated to Secretary of State for India, Bombay, and Constantinople.) Secretary of State for India’s telegram of 20th November Attitude of ™ eS \T 1 explained in my telegram to Foreign Department, dated Nobat, 14th JN ovember, how Kotaibi forced conflict on us. This tribe has been giving trouble all along; they are the strongest and most predatory amon-st the small tribes of north of Haushabi, and have for many years'oppressed their neighbour. Properly they are under Amir of Dthali, but they repudiate his authority. As to general situation, Arabs have been told, and more or less believe, that the withdrawal of Turks from Jalela, et cetera, was effected by payment of large sum to Sultan of Turkey. Turks also appear to have impressed on them that British troops could not fight. Despatch of troops to Somaliland, believed to be temporary, but which proved to be permanent, had stated effect, and when company of sappers was also withdrawn belief became general among more ignorant of the tribes that English had no more troops left I believe that this is real reason of Kotaibi outbreak: we prevented them from extorting money from travellers; and they thought that they were strong enough to try conclusions. Their defeat has improved situation, and they have few sympathisers. Amir of Dthali, as suzerain chief, was with our troops throughout, and fully approved of proceedings. As regards delimitation of the Haushabi border, the neighbouring Subaihis have been impressed by puishment inflicted on Kotaibis, and are somewhat ^ SS ij iV *° f 5 , 6 ^ ou bl esom e than before; but, as I have already said, I should like another half battalion of IN’ative infantry as soon as possible In no case have threats of force been made to any tribe. Every petty chief throughout the country knows that our presence in Hinterland is for pro tection of Arabs against encroachment of Turks, not to interfere with people. We have always said and shown that even those opposed to us would receive no injury whatever, provided that they left us alone^, but those who wantonly attacked us would be punished.

His Majesty’s Government assume that Commission will be ready to proceed with Haushabi delimitation as soon as Amiri frontier is settled. Subaihi border will then remain. Do you anticipate any difficulty in completing demarcation to sea coast owing to opposition of tribes ? Please instruct Resident to report. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 13/A December 1903. {Repeated to Aden,) Foreign Secret. Aden delimitation. Wahab’s report 1st October. His Majesty’s Government are most unwilling that proceedings of Commission should be protracted beyond present cold season. Ambassador at Con stantinople concurs, but is strongly opposed to proceedings being allowed to terminate without securing a line N.E. from Wadi Dana to desert which will effectually cut Turks off from access to Hadrarnaut, and so finally dispose of controversy with Porte as to Aden Hinterland. Please let me have your views on general question of delimitation N.E. from Wadi Bana. Information given in Wahab’s report as to Beda contains materials on which a notification to Porte of tribal frontier which we claim might be based, though it is not satisfactorily established that inner red line on map accompanying report corresponds with any real division between the tribes which it assigns to us and Turks respectively. Regarding Behan and country N.E. ot* Beda, there is practically no information on which to base a notification, and I think it necessary to obtain from Commission definite recommendations as to this portion of line before we can approach Porte with any proposals as to line N.E. from Wadi Bana. Failing practicable suggestions on this point from Commission, it seems worth considering whether the territory of Upper Aulaki, which according to map seems to extend to desert, could not be made our tribal frontier. Please instruct Resident to obtain from Commission further views on line to be claimed beyond Beda, and on question whether adoption of Upper Aulaki as tribal frontier would bar Turkish access to Hadramaut. Resident should also furnish any information he has as to geography of Upper Aulaki and report on progress made with treaties with Beda and Behan, which were sanctioned in order to secure line barring Turkish access to Hadramaut. If this can be secured by making Aulaki our tribal frontier His Majesty’s Government would desire scope of treaties with Beda and Behan to be strictly limited by pledges to which we may be alreadv committed. I gather from Memorandum of external information for October that Resident is already in communication with Aulaki as to treaty.Date. Initials.

I have the honour to inclose a copy of this document herewith. The Commission having recently informed me by telegraph that their Ottoman colleagues hesitated to acknowledge the Aulaki as one of the nine tribes, and also declined to recognize certain of the subsidiary tribes of the Yaffai as being under our protection, I presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday a pro-memorid, copy inclosed, requesting that orders should he sent to put a stop to these continued difficulties, and I took the opportunity of recapitulating once more by name the nine tribes. The Grand Vizier, whom I subsequently visited, informed me that the Amiri frontier-line as laid down in my Memorandum was already before the Sultan, and that he hoped very shortly to be able to tell me that instructions had been sent to the Turkish Commissioners on both points as desired.

Iviy Lord, tier between the nine cantons and the Yemen along the Amirt I explained in detail the reasons that rendered it impossible j. or H.M.Govt to accept the green line which hacL been drawn in a unilateral fashion on the map presented by the joint Commission last December and I stated that after a careful study and survey of the Amiri fron tier our Commissioner had traced a line whicr corresponded witn tne distribution of the tribes, hie configuration of the country and the permanent security of the frontier. Tne following day I broached the subject to tke oultan but I could not succeedc'jiwithout exercising a pres- % sure which under present circumstances I did not think it politic or necessary to employ^in persuading H.M. to discuss the question or to examine the map which I had taken the precaution to have in my pocket. I was obliged to be s^isfien with informing H.M. that I would prepare a Memo or Note for the M.F A. on the state of the case and with begging H.M. to give it his favourable consideration with a s ittle delay as pos- border. ible. The Sultan replied that he considered the fremitier The Marquess of Landdowne. K.G. questionquestion had been settled by the Irade he had issued in consequence of niy representations and that he hoped I would persuade my Government to accept this frontier and not to raise fresh difficulties. I said that I regretted that this was beyond my power, that K.n.G^t could not accept a frontier line which had been drawn by the Turkish authorities without the British Commission being allowed to examine the country or study ilrs topography or the claims of the Emir of Dhali. That it was now necessary to conclude these ne otiations welch were attended with enormous ex pense and considerable risk of conflict and that they desired to do so if possible by an amicable understanding with the Imperaial Govt and that I relied upon H.I.M’s support. I have drawn up tee enclosed Note Verbale for presentation to the M. .A. and accompanied it by a jpap showing 1) Our claim to the Haiki and Yubi country and Kataba by a red line. 2) Cur demandsjos now put fir ward which are in conformity with the frontier advocated by the British Commission and 3) The old green line on the joint map of Deer 1902. The Commission is anxious to be able to proceed if possible with the delimitation of the Amiri frontier at the end of the month, but I have not felt authorized to pre-sent the Note to the Imperial Government v/ithout Y.L.'s sanction and I should be lad to hear by telegraph if possible not later than the end of the week, whether Y.L. approves of it. I do not anticipate any serious difficulty in persuadingpersuading the GranX Vizier to get the Council of Minis ters to accept the frontier line now proposed although no doubt it would be combated by t e Ministers of War and of the Interior who have been opposed in past negotiations to any concession , but I fear I fl&amp;y encounter much res istance from the Sultan. Should I not succeed^I think it would be v/ell to authorize me to say that if the Imperial Govt persist in their refusal we shall be compelled to delimitate the frontier by ourselves and to insist on its being respected . I have &amp;c, (sd) N.R.O'Conor.Memorandum. The delays and difficulties which have arisen in connection with the delimitation of the frontier between the nine cantons under British protection and the Yemen are not unknown to the Sublime Porte:they may in great part be attributed to the hard and fast instructions sent to the Turkish local authorities to i adopt the green line marked on the map furnished by the two Commissions in December last. This line was drawn up by the Ottoman Commissioners without the British Commissioners having ary know ledge of the country or having been able to survey it: nevertheless in order to facilitate a solution it was accepted as roughly mar- king the country in dispute behind which the Turkish authorities r should retire. The solid portion of the^line indicated what was then assumed on insufficient grounds to be the frontier while the dotted part indicated that the frontier was there open to discussio Upon the British Commissioners surveying the country they found that tte proposed line cut the Dakkam tribe in two, that it didiiot answer to the topography of the country and that its acceptance would be likely to give rise in the future to just those regrettable conflicts and incidents which it is tip object of both Governments 1 to avoid. Moreover when the British Commissioners came to examine the evidence as to the extent of tie territory of the Emir of Dihal^J they found Firmans and documents showing that the Haiki and Yubi tribess P-) tribes belonged to Dthali territory and tiiat the frontier of Dthali followed tlB Soilat Kataba.a river running North of the town of j Kataba 8 therefore including Kataba within the nine Cantons. N.M.G. have declared tb. t 'fi yj seek no territorial aggrandisement and that their sole object v/as to delinitate a final and acceptable frontier. Animated with this spirit they have allowed me to waive their claims to Haiki^Yubi and Kataba^provided that the Imperial Ottoman Govt, on their side show an equally friendly disposition. After careful study and survey the Commission has now found a frontier which answers to the distribution of the; tribes and the configuration of the country and affords a guarantee against encroach raents on either side in the future,At the widest part this line does not diverge more than 5 kilometres from the dotted green line and it follows the location of the tribes ani the configuration of the country thus including El Ukla which is a small hamlet at the foot of a range of hills making a natural frontier and forming a good starting point for tlx delimitation of tlx country N.E, to the desert, The acceptance of this line will enable both Commissions to delimitate the Amiri frontier withour further delay and it is hoped | that the remainder of the work both H.Eastwards to the desert andSouthwards by the Haushabi tribes to the sea,will be finished at the latest by the end of the ye ai^ thereby putting an end to the expense ^ and risk of conflict attending the prolongation of the delimitatinn which the Ottoman Govt, as well as H.M.G. must be anxious to termi nate. With this object the Commissioners have drawn on the accompanying map the only boundary which meets the requirements of the Delimitation and in laying this demand before the Imperial Govt, in this friendly way H.M.G.hope that orders will be sent without .. delay to the Vali of the Yemen instructing him to inform the Turkish Commissioners that they should examine the proposed frontier in amicable agreement with the British Commissioners with a view to its acceptance.iL+Oj. •e is any mistake ii Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any niistdhe in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

T. 1509 IIFrom Viceroy, Wth August 1903. P. —Progress of Aden delimitation is so small, and its cost, whether the expensed are to be wholly borne by India, or, as I hope, shared by His Majesty's Government, is so heavy that I should like its proceedings concluded as soon as possible. Commission might first complete survey to Bana; then demarcate Amiri border after settlement ichich, I presume, is being made at Constantinople; thirdly, they might survey Haushabi border. This done, present Commissioners might then be withdrawn. Whatever local work in demarcating sections of frontier already surveyed might still be required, could be conducted by Abud, with the assistance of a Survey Officer, under the direct orders of the Resident. Our decision to proceed no further eastwards than Bana depends upon complete recognition of tribes within our Protectorate and upon settlement of points now in dispute with Turkey, to secure which pressure will, of course, be required at Constantinople. I am only submitting these ideas tentatively for consideration of Bis Majesty's Government. I have not consulted Resident. ^ h.

Rlease instruct Resident to transmit to Commissioners without delay all communications relating to their ivork which he may receive from the Government of India or Secretary of State.

As General Maitland suggests, we could take up demarcation of Haushabi and Subaihi countries after settlement of Amiri question, if position relative to the north-east has not much improved. As responsibility for f uture management of the tribes will fall on the Resident, any proposal affecting our relations icith them should come through him.

Sir N.

In these circumstances Lord Lansdowne would propose Ihe Under Secretary of State, India Office. Hpropose to instruct Sir N.

Lord:- With reference zo Your Lordship's telegram No .122 of the 1 st instant, suggesting that I should urge the Ottoman Government to postpone the extension of their telegraph line to Fat aha, I have the honour to remark as follows:- A request of this nature would certainly he interpreted by the Turkish Government a.s a symptom, of our intention to obtain possession of that place, and it would affect the good result which I hope may be had in regard to the delimitation of the whole Amiri frontier, by telling them that we do not insist upon any claims which we may have to Kataba. Apart from this, I do not see the neces sity of this request, or how it concerns one deli mi tstion down the Wadi Titan or, even if it did, how I could -he Marquess of La nsdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,could Justify It. The Turkish telegraph line now goes to Tais, and from thence to K at aha It will tra verse exclusively Ottoman territory. Furthermore, repeated assurances have been given to the Ottoman Government that His Majesty’s Governnent do not desire any extens ive or wholesa 1 e departure from the limits laid down by the green line, and I fear these assurances would be rendered nugatory by a demand such as the British Resident at Aden suggests, and which I trust Your Lordship will not instruct me to prefer.

The Secretary of State for India proposes to approve the Viceroy's suggestion as to the demarca tion of the frontier in a South-west direction to the Sea as soon as the Mir's border has been settled, and to instruct the Resident at Men to prepare be forehand a report upon the approximate frontier which it would be expedient to claim for the Haushabi and Subaihi tribes. As regards the question of concluding Treaties with the Upper Yaffai and other tribes, the Secretary of State suggests that the Government of India should be authorised to proceed in accordance with the instructions sent on the 4th of May last, leav ing 3 Under Secretary of State, India Office.leaving the question of eventual delimitation to the desert in a Northreast direction to he settled con formably to the decision of His Majesty's Government conveyed to the Viceroy on May 16th. I am to inform you, in reply, that Lord Lans- dcwne concurs in these proposals.From Resident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, e §th June 1903.

S f 29 rt May 1903. u ' : (Repeated to Secretary of State for India, Bombay, and Const an tinop le .) Your telegram of 28th May, Secretary of State’s telegram of 26th May. Ireaties. Action was at once taken on Secretary of State’s telegram of 4 th May. I have already provisionally concluded satisfactory treaty with one section of the Upper Yaffai, and Sheiks of the Mausatta, the most important section, have announced intention of coming in. I have sent for Chiefs of .Beda and their principal Sheikhs, and I am waiting for them at Aden. ±act tnat British Government were prepared to conclude treaties has become h^s had, I think, excellent effect, and greatly strengthens hands ot well-affected majority among Upper Yaflfai. To hang back now would he little short ot disastrous. I understand that one of the principal reasons for postponing demarcation to desert was that it gave us time to conclude treaties ; it will he probably six months before all have been arranged. Risk alluded to in Secretary of State’s telegram does not appear to me great; Yatrai can, I think, look after themselves, and we shall be able, I hope, to send officers hack with Beda Chiefs, who will obtain information regarding district on frontier, now greatly needed. In my opinion encroachment is less likely to he attempted after than before treaty. I would also venture to lemind His Majesty’s Government that Beda is not one of the nine cantons, and that, at present, whole may be claimed by Turkish officials.

Ihence it leads west-north-west to the junction of the Selat Hu mar with the Selat Kataba. From this point it would, apparently, follow the Selat Kataba south-west for 3 to 3^ miles; after which is turns westward so as to include the whole oi the Dakkam country in the territories of the Amir. From here its course is shown by the green line on the Map “ C ” (general survey of the Amiri border zone).

A line smarting as before, but following the main course of the Selat Kataba, and therefore giving Kataba to the Amir. Afterwards this line follows the foot of the hills so as to include the vvhoie of the Yubi and Haiki country, and finally joins the green line at a point about three miles west ot the junction of the Selat Kataba'with the Tiban. 1 he Yu hi and Haiki country is a tract of about 130 square miles lying wholly outside the green line.

Sir ’ T TTA \ 7 T? 1 1 Camp Sanah, near Kataba, May 25, 1903. rp 1 1 , tie honour to report that, almost immediately after the evacuation bv the i urks of Jalela and the neighbouring Amiri villages, I moved the Commission to this village of Sanah some 2 miles south of Kataba, finding the Turkish Commission camped close by that place. 2. Their attitude was still their usual one of excessive suspicion, but, in spite of this, we succeeded in almost at once beginning the joint survey which was the necessarv pre liminary to actual demarcation. 3: I arranged with them to make a detailed survey 2 kilom. roughly on each side of where the boundary would run. The map sent with my Report No. 180 of the 2nd De- cembei, 1902, showing the green line, was styled by the Turkish Commissioners and myself a “ carte approximative,” it being understood that the exact details would be worked out at the time of actual delimitation, and my information of the counirv along the south west continuation of the green line towards the Dakkam and Wadi Tiban was so meagre, and the Turkish Commissioners’ map on which it was based probably so inaccurate, that I merely drew a broken or dotted line. 4. As^reported in my telegrams Nos. 256 and 260, “these gross, if not wilful, in accuracies ” were soon revealed, watercourses, depressions, and the position of villages being marked miles out of their actual place, and in total disregard of the configuration of the ground. I he Turks have no trained Surveyor or instruments, and had evidently never expected that their misconstruction of facts and topography, backed up last 'year by arguments of force and “bluff,” would ever be put to the test of accurate survey. 5. Again, they were most anxious to keep up, in the eyes of the natives, the fiction that the lurkish party which accompanied our survey party on both sides of the green line was participating in the joint survey. By humouring them in this respect, and the exercise of great forbearance, 1 succeeded in nearly completing the survey of the ground around and near Kataba, as shown in the copy of the Boundary Survey Map marked (A) hereto attached, when the Turkish Commissioners, apparently in virtue of their original instructions, relapsed into their old policy of obstruction by claiming that the Selat Kataba, i.e., the Kataba watercourse, or the Amiri boundary, recognized in the Turkish Sultan’s rescript in 1619 during the early Ottoman occupation, and by the Imams of Sana, as shown by the numerous documents attached to my Memorandum No. 180 of the 2nd December, 1902, was not the main watercourse running north of Kataba, but a small overflow channel running south of that place, and known below' or south-west of Kataba as the Wadi Shaddad. South-w est of the well called Ai Azlum, close to Kataba, the Wadi Shaddad, upon which name even the Turks are agreed, runs south-west for some miles and then rejoins the main watercourse, or real Selat Kataba, close to the village of Lakmat- ad-Duki. 6. The untenable theory of the Turks would have obliged our surveyor and this Commission to wilfully mark incorrectly on a map put pol ling to be the result of an accurate scientific survey, the main waiercourse of the country across which the boundary is supposed to run. This, of course, was out of the question, and was contrary to the Turkish instructions, the text of which was telegraphed by Sir N. O’Conor in his No. 1 1 of the I8th March, ordering the Turks to delimit on the bases of the green line “ in accordance with the configuration of the ground.” While this inaccuracy of the Turkish map was being laid bare, the Turkish “ surveyor ” became exceedingly suspicious and obstructive. 7. Though the village of Kataba w f as under the Amir’s control previous to 1873, I abstained from making any official claim to it on his behalf, but told the Turkish Com missioners that, as the “ configuration of the ground ’’ showed the Amiri boundary running north of Kataba, it would be better to continue the survey of the Selat Kataba and the Wadi Shaddad to their junction, with a view to finding a solution of the difficulty. The Turks agreed, and on the following day sent their party to accompany our surveyor, whowas Working on tbe^2 kHom^ the 6 2 tl kUom a} on W the norti^side of' Selat Kataba, they not only refused to eo-operate, but forbade his working there o Th „ v exolained their attitude by saying that their instructions were not to delimit on the' basis of the green line “ in accordance with the configuration of the ground,' but 'to apply the ■’■reen line strictly to the ground,” ignoring its mamfest inaccuracies, the fac tha it was S a rough line with the express reserve written on the corner of the map t,r it, “ details were taken &lt;rom Turkish and native sources the fact that a great part Offt m... the supposed junction and south-west through the Dakkam country was merely dotted, and that the junclion of the depression running south of Kataba with the belat Kataba is not as shown on their map just below that place, but a good way south-wes 9 1 noimed out the physical impossibility of applying such an inaccurate line o “ the configuration of the ground,” and endeavoured to induce them to take a reasonable view, but They persisted in their pretention, stopped the survey on the 2-nd April, and as reported in my telegram No. 26'), referred the matter home, thus leaving me no option but to follow ^' e e s ®'' e k ®°“ a r ^ 2 . t , uis ,. pndered it impossible to come to any arrangement below the junction of the Wadi Reshun, I endeavoured with them to find the point ol contact of the Amiri border with Mares between the noith-east continuation of the Selat Ka aba above the point north-east of that place, where the overflow channel running, south of Kataba leaves the main watercourse running north of it, that is the adi i awa an .the Wadi Reshaii, running between the high hills of Jarad and Barkan and the mountain all of Mares rising abruptly 2,000 feet above the plain. 11 The Turks declare that the villages of Reshan, Huan Zmia, and IJkla are not Mares, so that we should be entitled to include all three in Amin territory, more especially as both the configuration of the ground and Imami documents, dating as far back as '1711 A.D., prove the Amir’s title to the village of Reshan (vide Document 2). 12 In the hope of inducing my Turkish colleagues to delimit even the 3 miles between Lakmat-es-Shub and Kataba, 1 offered to leave the two villages of Resto, and Huan Zinia on their side, and draw the line along Jarad and Barkan to where the latter, in accordance with the configuration of the ground, join on to what th «y‘h e msdves cl the mountains of Mares, leaving A1 Ukla, which is detached tromJehelBakamad Marcs, to the Amir, to whom it should belong in virtue of Document 3 A^dmg to the latter, Bilad-al-Khurraj, which, as shown by the attached certificate of the Cadi of Khobar comprises A1 Ukla, had in the time of the Imams the same status as Haiaz '. t ‘’ e ( anc ' en , n S ® a ‘ of the Amira near Jalela. The inclusion of AV Ukla is, moreover, essential for finding a point to continue the boundary north-east between Mares and the Shaibi section of lata. 13. The large district of Mares, stretching from the Selat Kataba to the Rner tia , and covering an area of some 200 square miles, with its forty villages is shown by documentary and oral evidence to be related to h ala, all sections o w ic n e recently, by Imperial Irade, been recognized as within the British sphere. 14. Although the peaceful and friendly character of the people of Mares woulu h insured this Commission an easier passage north-east than through the more in epen e and avaricious sections of Shaibi, Mausatta, &amp;c„ and though the real sources ot the selat Kataba take their rise within Mares, yet, in a spirit of compromise, 1 ave 110 P these claims—an attitude which is in sharp contrast with that ot the lurks. 15. As regards the green line on the “ approximate ” map accompanying the A Report of the 2nd December, 1902, I particularly disclaimed any responsibility tor t topographical accuracy, and wrote on the corner of the map that ‘‘ AH details on i P to the north and west'of Jihaf are from Turkish or native sources.’ 16. The extraordinary and violent attitude of the lurks last yn a r when tiey oc p Jihaf and Mafari in force,'and fired on anv member of our Commission venturmg eyo the cordon drawn clear round Dthala, is still fresh in the memory of His Majesty 17. It then seemed hopeless to find any basis for delimiting the Amin bou ), » in accordance with Government’s decision in August last, 1 compiled, at t e , disadvantage, the information on which a solution of the Amiri question was ,o » and then prepared to proceed with the north-east delimitation. Owing, J )V ' eve f • t 0 same obstructive and violent methods of the Turks from their position a aea ’ / became impossible, so that, some seven months after the original decision to procei the north-east delimitation. His Majesty’s Government decided t0 . brms t * ertain evacuation of Jalela and thus put our Commission in a proper position to asu ^ accurately the details necessary lor the establishment ot the Amin or ei.Commi ss i° n is thus only now in the position where it ought to have started in December 18. Some of the inaccuracies of the green-line map based on the Turkish Commis sioners map are manifest from a comparison of the original green line and the results of r the survey (Map A) carried out jointly by the British and Turkish surveyors immediately fter the evacuation of Jalela. 19. I should here remark that the Selat Kataba, or water-course of Kataba, as also other water-courses between the Rivers Tiban and Bana, is not, like the latter, a perennial or continuous stream of water, but merely a dry stream-bed appearing topographically as a depression in the land, and only here and there, according to the configuration of the ground, presenting the feature of well-defined banks, the greater part of the water-course, or depression, consisting of fields and cultivation, with difficulty distinguishable from the lands on both sides. It is only during the three months’ rainy season in the year and after the torrential downpour that these portions of the water-courses (Selat or Wadi) near steep hills or slopes in the ground have a flow of water, which in a few hours is soaked in by and disappears in the parched fields. 20. The joint survey (Map Ai shows that the main water-course, or Selat Kataba, runs north of Kataba, while the Selat Reshan is not, as shown on the Turkish map, to the north of Kataba, but applies to the reach of the water-course in the immediate neighbour hood of the village of Reshan. The course of the Selat Kataba after Kataba runs down by Lakmat-ad-Duki, near which it is joined by its tributaries, the Selat-ar-Rebi, the Selat Husman from the north-east, and by the Wadis running south of Kataba and past the villages of Kabil-es-Salami and Jes-al-Jamal. The main water-course, or Selat Kataba, is known as such down to the village of Sharifa, on the border of the Dakkam, and on its junction with the Tiban, although the villagers give each section of it a distinctive name, e.g., from the junction of the Wadi Humar to a point south of the village of Shakhab it is called Labhur; lower down, Abara, Hefash, &amp;c. 21. The Wadi shown on the survey map as running from the junction of the Wadi Reshan near the hill called Bilar, and down to the well A1 Aslum, is simply an overflow channel originally started and still used for irrigation purposes in years of heavy rain, when there is a superabundance of water in the main channel. Katabo, 22. As the Selat Kataba, shown as the Amiri boundary in Turkish official documents of 1619 a.d. and Imami documents up to the eighteenth century, runs north of Kataba,, that place would naturally remain on the British side of the border, and it was doubtless to obviate such a contingency that the Turks in their map juggled with the topography of the country round Kataba and called the Selat Kataba the Selat Reshan, which really lies to the north-east of Kataba. 23. Apart from the geographical situation of Kataba, the Amir’s rights to the place are based on the following evidence :— (1.) Document 1 attached to this Memorandum—an Imami document, dated 1702 a.d., showing that the Amirs had dues and rights in Kataba at that date. (2.) No. V in my No. 180 of the 2nd December, 1902—Decree of the Imam of Sana, dated the Mussulman month of A1 Haj A1 Haram 1217 a.h., or 104 years ago, ordaining that the Amir should receive from the Imam’s agent and representative at Kataba 40 dollars and 30 kada of grain per month, equal to an annual revenue of 1,560 dollars. N.B.—The same document ordained monthly payments to the Amir of 40 dollars and 40 kada of grain from the towm of Taiz. (3.) Document No. 32 in my Memorandum No. 180 of the 2nd December, 190^, dated 1277 A.h., i.e., 1860 A.D., an acknowledgment of the suzerainty of the Amir by the Sheikh of Kataba, who undertook to pay him 150 dollars per annum as tribute, together with half the proceeds of the market of Kataba, previously assigned to the Amira. (4.) Document No. 33 of my No. 180 of the 2nd December, 1902, dated 128^ A.H*, i.e. f 1866 A.D., confirms the preceding. ... rva &gt; u- * 24. These three latter documents are a fair indication of the last 100 years history of the place. The power of the Imams of Sana, in Yemen, gradually shrank, until it extended but a short distance beyond the capital of Sana, and Document 2 shows the [2018 i—1] C6 transference of Kataba from the sovereignty of the Imams to the suzerainty of the Ami rs 4 25. Document H shows that, in I860 a.d., the Sheikhs of the family of Hanumi, U, the hereditary Sheikas of the place, had become subject to the Amir, agreeing to pay the latter 150 dollars as annual tribute, together with half the market dues, amounting to a considerable annual sum, and these payments were actually continued for some time after the Turkish invasion in 1873, the Amir’s share of the market dues having been since appropriated by the Kataba Municipality, or, in other words, by the local Turkish oflicials. 26. These documentry proofs of the Amir s rights are conclusive, while the oral evidence of credible witnesses, who remember the state of things before the coming of the Turks in 187T poin s in the same direction. 27. The Kadi of Khobar, or chief religious and legal authority of this whole district, where the Sheria Mahommedan law alone obtains, is not at all well disposed to the Amir, and was the close friend of the fanatical Turkish nominee of Lakmat-es-Sallah, the author of recent inflammatory appeals to Jihad against the British. Yet his evidence is that, before the Turks made their appearance in 1873, Kataha was administered by Sheikhs and elders, under the Amir, the Imam of Sana’s agent only visiting the place once or twice a year. 28 . Sheikh Musad Abdurrahman Aida Hanumi, son of the Sheikh of Kataba at the time of the coming of the Turks, and subsequently deposed from the Sheikhship on account of his leanings towards the Amir, confirms the above. 29. Kataba is a large village of some 400 houses, of which over 100 are inhabited by Jews, and the remainder by Arabs, the Turkish element being represented by three or four officials, together with the military, who are quartered in tents near the remains of a small guard-house to the west of Kataba, built many years ago of sun-dried mud bricks, but 'now marked “ ruined ” (“ kharab ”) on the Turkish map. 30. The normal garrison of the place appears to have been some thirty men in support of the Jalela outpost, the real military centre being at Nadira, some twelve hours’ journey on the road to Yerim. 31. The houses, of sun-dried bricks, are mostly very small, and of one or two storeys, while there is but one small mosque. Owing to the blighting influence of Turkish rule, many of the houses are in a dilapidated condition, and over 100 are reported to be uninhabited. 32. The inhabitants are adherents of the Amir, but the recent prompt deportation by the Turk^of the son of the Sheikh, who in 1873 adhered to the cause of the Amir, Aii Mukbil, coupled with a stern prohibition against visiting us, prevents any overt manifesta tion of their feelings. 33. I should not forget to add that even the Turkish Sultan’s Rescript, quoted in paragraph 59, by declaring that all between the Selat Kataba and the Wadi Hilah belonged to the Amir, obviously included in Amiri territory Kataba, which lies south of the Selat Kataba. 34. In fact, it is clear that during the nineteenth century, when the power of the imams of Sana was on the decline, the influence of the ancient house of the Amirs, who, far from being parvenus of comparatively recent and obscure origin, date back at least some 400 to 500 years to the time preceding the original Turkish conquest in 1520 A.D., increased, and their territory comprised, beyond their old country, the districts of Yerim, Damar, and all the country up to Ibb and Taiz inclusive. 35. The Amirship was fora hundred years a big factor in Southern Arabia, and the fact that they originally appear to have been an offshoot of the House of the Imams of Sana seems to have influenced the latter in viewing with complacency the absorption by the Amirs of districts that were gradually slipping from their own grasp. 36. The approximate extent over which they directly or indirectly exercised authority and influence previous to 1873 is shown on tracing “ B,’’ accompanying this Memorandum. 37. When the Turks, after an absence of 242 years, reconquered Yemen, they swept down over the country as far even as Lahej, which, despite the protests of Her Majesty s Government, they continued to hold until a force was actually marched out of Aden to expel them. They apparently did not at first interfere with the then Amir, Ali Mukbil, collecting his revenues (as set forth in Documents 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and exercising influence in Kataba, in the hope that he would be amenable to their wishes, but when he refused to surrender his independence and rights, and claimed the protection of the British Govern ment In virtue of our written engagements towards him, they suddenly appropriated or stopped the payment of his Kataba dues and tribute.Turkish' , Wen ‘ t0 Aden to oom P lain of a ' ld *mand protection against retnrf n a Wa - S S lve 1 n J assurances by the Resident, hut, immediately on his Ta z where h h ’ ln ! e, f ?led over to Katab a by the Turks, seized, and sent oft to he . was .‘brown into prison for having sought “ infidel Enehsh ” nrotection. as kept m prison for some months, regardless of the protests of His Majesty’s ^vernment, although renewed and energetic remonstrances ultimatelv secured his release. as the bheikh of Kataba, named Abdurrahman Aida Hanumi, remained staunch to the Amir, he was promptly deposed by the Turks from the Sheikhship, and when recently, on the arrival ot this Commission in the vicinity ot Kataba, his son. Sheikh Musa d Abdurrahman, paid the Amir a friendly visit, the Turks immediately removed him to the Haiki country, where they detained him by force, although the Amir wrote express ing a wish to see him on business connected with extensive landed property owned by the oheikh within the now recognized Amiri limits. 40. Should His Majesty’s Government decide to support the Amir’s claims to Kataba, and insist on its restoration to him, the Turkish resistance to such a course would probably be mainly based on the “ argument ” that from time immemorial it has formed an integral portion of the Sanjak of Taiz. The expression “time immemorial” usually refers to some date in the distant past, but in the mouths of Tuikish officials would appear to be a meaningless term, having no pretensions to be based on historical accuracy, while almost the entire so-called “administrative district” of Kataba has been carved'out of Amiri territory without the slightest regard for the repeated remonstrances of His Majesty’s Government or the as often repeated assurances of the Sublime Forte. 41. Again, as in the case of Jaleia, they may lay stress on the guard-house and other Government buildings at the place. However, as stated above, the Turkish map of Zakariya Effendi marks the guard-house as “ in ruins,” while the only other building of a public nature is that used as the Government offices, and is a two-storied structure of sun-dried mud bricks, repaired and whitewashed on one side, some three months ago, by Zakariya Effendi, out of some money collected mostly from the Amir’s subjects. Dakkam. 42. As the Turks stiil refuse to admit the Amir’s rights to the whole Dakkam, or Fajra, the district name by which it is officially known to the Turks, I may again briefly state their case — 43. The Imami Rescript (No. IV in my No. 180 of the 2nd December, 1902), dated a.h. 1118, or a.d. 1707, assigns the Amirs ” 140 kadas of grain and 140 dollars from Jihaf, Fajra (ie., Dakkam), and the Humada, and he should protect them from aggi ession by the people of Taim, Halmin, and Radfan, as they are under his orders, and he (the Amir) is their representative before God.” This proves the subjection of Fajra, or Dakkam, in the Amirs in the time of the Imams. 44. Again, before the coming of the Turks in 1873, Document 7 in my No. 180 of the 2nd December, 1902, shows that in a.h. 1265, or a.d. 1868, Husen Naji Zendani, Sheikh of Jihaf, and Abdallah Saleh-ad-Dakkarn, Sheikh of Fajra, appeared before the Kadi of Khobar, and “ acknowledged, cn behalf of themselves, thieir relatives, people, and all the inhabitants of their countries, that the Amir, Shafal Abd-al-Hadi, was their father and ruler, and that they are his for weal or woe, good or evil. They are to listen to and obey God and him. They have undertaken and bound themselves to pay him in per petuity 80 dollars annually, binding themselves to this in the oath of God and in the presence of witnesses.” 45. After the irruption of the Turks into Amiri territory, Husen Naji Zendani, of Jihaf, was forced to submit to the Turks, and persuaded Abdallah Saleh-ad-Dakkam to pay tribute to them through himself (Husen Naji Zendani). After the death of both the Dakkam fought and successfully resisted Turkish pretensions. They have never since paid tribute or taxes to the Turks, and have throughout acknowledged the suzerainty of the Amir. Some seven years ago, at Turkish instigation, Saleh Zendani, their recent nominee on Jihaf, betrayed Sheikh Naji, the present Dakkam Chieftain, to the Turks, who flung him into prison, and only released him after two months on payment ot 300 dollars as ransom. v 46. In March last Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, after laying waste the villages of Jabai Hosha, threatened to invade the Dakkam. The Commission brought the facts to the. notice of Government, adding that the Dakkam “as a whole” should be included in theAmiri border-a view which was endorsed by his Excellency the Viceroy in his telegram °nhe 6 th March. tQ my No . 180 , 0 f the 2nd December, 1902 I left the green line in the Dakkam country dotted remarking “ between Kataba and the Humada Se coun.rv is unsurveyed owing to the determined opposi ion of the Turkish Comm,s- • ° * nv Rritish nartv visiting the disputed territory, and I have since discovered sioneis t 1 Y vi j| a&lt;re y s marked on the Turkish map as on this side of the dotted UntaTe reaUv^yond it, while Ukaib, the residence cf the Dakkatn Chieftain, is on the WeSt 48 ' Dakkairf (Fajra^t'^ pre-Turkish times as shown by the above-quoted docu- rnents has always gone with Jihaf, while the Turkish relatious with the place have also been through the Jihaf Sheikh, and now that Jihaf has been restored to the Annr, the Faira (Dakkam) naturally reverts with it- , . , , 49 The Dakkam Chieftain, who, during the first days after our arrival here, was busy looking after refugees, the victims of Turkish oppression m the Haih country, has come in to renew in person his relations of friendship and fealty with the A 60 r WI,en the Turks, on the 22nd April, stopped the joint survey I sent a survey party into the Dakkam country. This provoked rather violent protests form the furkis Commissioners, but as our claim to the Dakkan, “ as a whole is so clear, and as ,t would probably have taken weeks, if not months, to obtain the acquiescene. of the Sultan’s P Government to our survey, I ignored their protests, and completed the survey. Haiki and Yubi. 51 Beyond the broken or dotted portion of the green line are the villages of the small clans of Haiki and Yubi, whose Claims to be admitted within the limits of the Amir and the latter’s rights over them can no longer be ignored. . r ,. . 52 The document (No. 4 , attached to this Memorandum) establishing the, subjection to the Amir has been in the hands of Commission since its arrival here, but bein- prevented bv the Turks from visiting the Selat Kat ^ b \ and , rel ^ l 'f • l u °k| information “ from'Turkish or native sources,” I then thought that the Haiki and Yabi villages were situated, not actually on the dotted green hnc ’ and . th % pl T. b r ' e Mount Jihaf and the range to the north, but among the hdls of. that ran ? e ; Circumstances then pointed to the possibility of the Yubi and Haiki remaining Turkish short j y before tbe evacuation of Jalela, Zakanya Effendi, former Turkish Commissioner and Acting Sub-Governor of Kataba, but since , . both functions owing to the remonstrances of His Majesty s Governmen » P™ ^ taxes from the Yubi villages with the usual Turkish accompanirnents village-burning.

The tract of country inhabited by the Yubi villagers, som mo untaiii southern or Jihaf side of the Seiat Kataba, is the small plain lying be wee ^ of Jihaf and the Dakkam border on the south and the lofty range of Awhile on the east they are hemmed in by the continuous mountain barrier of A1 Aud and +v. a - eS u our c ^ a,n [ ls to which latter we are disposed to surrender to the Turks. On the west their boundary is the Haiti country. 56. Most of the Yubi have been forced by Turkish exactions and oppression to emigrate, and they now possess some seven small villages, composed of two or three ^uses, each house being surrounded by some huts inhabited by the slaves and retainers o the master of the house, with their families. Besides these villages there are about twenty hamlets, consisting of from four up to twenty huts, scattered over the plain. 57. The document proving the former subjection of the Yubi villages to the Amirs also establishes a similar subjection of their western neighbours, the Haiki. The area of their country is about the same as that of the Yubi, while their villages number six, with eighteen hamlets, both similar to those of the Yubi. The Ldaiki case has also been brought into prominence by Turkish barbarous methods. Since our arrival here the Turks, evidently with the same idea of terrorizing them, have carried fire and sword among the Haiki villages, destroying their villages with cannon and forcing the inhabitants to take refuge in the Dakkam country. 58. The document on which the Haiki-Yubi and Amiri relations are based, and dated 1285 a_.h., i.e., 1867 A.D., or some six years before the beginning of Turkish encroachments, is perfectly authentic and genuine, being drawn up by the Seyids of Ad Dubiyat, who are still extant, and witnessed by respectable Sheikhs who are not the Amir’s direct subjects, and whose testimony is consequently more reliable. 59. Again, Document No. 3, attached to my Memorandum on the Amiri border, No. 180 of the 2 nd December, 1902, is an official letter dated 1029 a h., or 1619 a.d., of the then Pasha of Y£men, embodying the Turkish Sudan’s Imperial Rescript confirming the Amir in his boundaries “ from the Selat Kataba to the Selat Milah, with all that lies between them, and from the Wadi Bana to the Wadi Tiban, with all their tribu taries, &amp;c.” Water-courses like the Wadis Rebi, Husman, Jimri, &amp;c., shown on the map as tributaries of the Selat Kataba and Wadi Tiban, run through the Haiki and Yubi district, so that the Amir’s rights in the matter are supported by documents dated 1619 A.D., or during the Turkish era, and 1867 a.d., or the era of the Imams of Sana. 1 should add that in neither the Haiki nor Yubi districts have the Turks any posts, barracks, or permanent official buildings. 60. The renewal of Turkish obstructive methods in the matter of the Dakkam, with Al Ukla, and their extraordinary interpretation of the course of the Selat Kataba, as well as the instructions to the Joint Commission to refer to their respective Governments any points that could not be decided on the spot, leave me no choice but to refer these latter questions to His Majesty’s Government. 1 have, therefore, stated the case of the Yubi and Haiki, as, should His Majesty’s Government decide not to condone Turkish encroachments in both districts and insist on their being restored to the Amir, their inclusion in a final and comprehensive settlement would seem natural, if not easy, just as the Shaibi were apparently accidentally included in the Irade of the 13th February, acknowledging the British claim over the Yafa, although the Turkish Commissioners here were prepared to make a more stubborn fight over them than over many portions of Amiri territory recently relinquished by their Government. 61. The Amir’s rights over the Yubi and Haiki being incontrovertible, there remains the question of the expediency of claiming them, both from the political point of view, as also from the point of view of securing a sound border. I can say nothing on the political side of the question, but the pretensions of the Tutks to prove that the Wadi Shadad is the Selat Kataba shows the hopelessness of an open water-course, dry practically through out the whole year, covered with cultivation, and lying across the plain, ever forming a permanent border that Turkish officials, custom-house and others, are likely to respect; while the boundaries of the Yubi and Haiki, running up to the foot of the lofty ranges of Al Aud and Mares, from the natural dividing-line between the plain and the highlands of Y 6 men. r u o i • 62. The area occupied by these two sections consists of an open fan-shaped plain, sparsely inhabited and traversed by the numerous water-courses which meet near the head of the Tiban Gorge between the Hosha and Jihaf Mountain. Were this restored to the Amir, the very desirable result of keeping aggressive and unscrupulous lurkish officials and soldiery out of the plain might be obtained. Once out of the plain, their boundary would not easily lend itself to the establishment ot custom-houses intended rather to strangle the Aden Hinterland trade than for the collection of legitimate revenue. [2018 i—l] D10 S . i 63 . Under the very eyes of this Commission they have started customs under tents in disputed territory to the south of the Selat Kataba, and are levying dues far in excess of the 1 per cent, export and 8 per cent, import duties sanctioned by Treaty. They have detained even our Commission camels for three days, despite our protests, only releasing them on our paving exorbitant dues. I have remonstrated w.th them about the propriety of startin', a customs, even in tents, within the belt of territory still to be delimited; h* their onlv reply was, suddenly and without warning, to begin converting the custom, in tents into a stone structure, with the evident intent of settling tins part ot the boundary by a “ fait accompli ” on the same lines as their occupation of Jihaf and Mafari hist &gt; 6 y- ghoii]d ;t be deci()ec | not to i ns i st on the reinstatement of the Amir in his rights over the Haiki and Yubi, the Ottoman Government should certainly he compelled to refund him the revenue he would have drawn during the last thirty years, amounting, at the 100 and 150 dollars per annum stipulated in the Yubi and Naiki documents respec tively, to 1,500/., calculated at the former rate of rupees 2 : 8 to the dollar and rupees to the £ sterling. If paid locally by the Yemen authorities—a course which would save the Ottoman Government the difference arising from the depreciation of the Maria Theresa dollar-the amount would be 7,500 dollars. I may add^ that the Turkish officials have been endeavouring to extract annually from the Yubi 1,500 dollars and about 2,000 dollars from the Haiki, or 3,500 dollars in all per annum, with the result stated above that the country has been practically reduced to a waste, most of the villageis having emigrated to places where thev are not so exposed to Turkish exactions. 65. Should* the Amir’s rights to these lands be compounded for the above money payment, that sum represents what he has lost during the last thirty jears wrongful occupation by the Turks, and does not allow for the goodwill or a number of years' purchase. It would, therefore, seem advisable not to formally and officially surrender his claims and thereby prejudice the future; for, if his northern boundary is drawn across the plain from near Kataba to the Wadi Tiban along a dry water-course, full of cultivation, such a boundary is almost certain to lead to disputes, eventually forcing both Governments to reopen the entire question. This is specially to be foreseen in the case of neighboms, who, like the Turks, display such raiding tendencies in the collection of taxes and their so-called 11 suppression of smuggling.” Amara, Humar, Shurman, and Janadiya. 66 . Document 4, which is a Decree ot the Imam of Sana, bearing date a.h. 1118 or a.d. 1707, assigns to the Amirs “ specified amounts, in addition to those duly fixed an received by them from the time of their predecessors, viz., 50 kada of grain monthly (amounting to some 600 dollars per annum) from Humar and Shurman, and 30 dollars worth of grain in kind with 40 dollars per month (i.e., 90 dollars per month, or 1,560 dollars pei* annum) from Janadiya and Amara, the fixed amounts from Uddain, Taiz, and Kataba to be continued to him as usual, and he has to ensure the safety of the roads in his territory.” K.B.—The phrase from “Amara” to “in his territory ” was omitted through the copyist’s error in the translation submitted in the Memorandum of the -n December, 1902. 67. The lands of Amara, Humar, Shurman, and Janadiya lie in the western tributanes of the Wadi Tiban, and were, consequently, as shown by the document quote in paragraph 59, within Amiri limits. The Turks have had no regular administration in these parts, but ruled them through their nominee, the notorious Muhammad Nasir JV u 1 &gt; who lived at Daheneh, near the village of Mavia. # rr h hi 68 . His attempts, culminating in the Ad Dareja incident in 1901, to include ans a territory within that of Humar. though defeated in that instance, may have been toa . SII ?^ ii extent successful in other cases which have hitherto escaped notice. IJiis Com truss! ^ has not yet had an occasion of visiting and examining the Haushabi borcier, bu i is be foreseen that any minor rectifications of that border which may be found necessary ^ the moment of actual delimitation there would be rendered impossible if the min r g to Humar are now definitely ceded to Turkey. After any such cession to the ui will hold us strictly to what they now consider the border between Haushabi an ^ and as the Haushabi have no claim to Humar, the possible necessary rectificationsHau«habi border, on the nine tribes basis, would only be practicable by keeping open the Amir s claims to the former Amiri clan of Humar. It may even seem advisable, while leaving Shurman and Janadiya to Turkey, to claim the country of the clans Amara and Humar, thus rounding off the Amiri-Haushabi portion of the boundary, and giving a practicable road-connection along that part of the boundary, the Tiban defile through the precipitous mountains of Hosha and Jihaf being impracticable for traffic. 69. The Turkish Commissioners have seen the above document ; but I have based no claim on it, leaving the decision to His Majesty's Government. 70. As shown by the red line on tracing (B), attached to this Memorandum, the Amir’s sphere of influence and authority, delegated by the Imams even as far back as 1707 A.D., covered a wide stretch of territory, but the Amir himself draws a distinction between the territory between the red and blue lines, where he exercised no really direct and independent sway, and the territory south of the blue and green lines, which he directly governed, both with the consent of the Imams and that of the people of the country, as proved by the documents exhibited. I refer to the Haiki, Yubi, and the village of Kataba. 1 have shown that his rights over all three are indisputable. 71. As regards Kataba, it has been the centre of a caza or administrative sub-district, and as such the Turks may be specially anxious to retain it, but, as mentioned above, the ‘ f former ” Caza of Kataba was carved almost entirely out of Amiri territory, and com prised Upper Yafa, with Shaibi, Shairi (Jalela), Jihaf, Mafari, &amp;c. It is highly inexpedient that the administrative centre of even the now reduced caza should be situated on the very edge of the Amiri border, and, if a concession is made to the Turks and Kataba left in their possession, our line should be rigidly drawn close round the place, so as to accentuate the present tendency of the Turks to remove the “ caza ” centre to the healthier spot of Nadira, some twelve hours’ journey north of Kataba. In that way Kataba itself would sink into insignificance and cease to be a potential source of unrest ou the Amir’s frontier. 72. A line drawn from the point of junction of the Selat Reshan and the Selat Kataba (close to the hillock called “ Bitar”), where the overflow' channel comes down in front of Kataba ; then along the channel bed to the well called A1 Aslum, and thence across to the junction of the Selat Humar with the Selat Kataba, would secure this result, while leaving two roads from Kataba to the Mares country in the hands of the Turks. Amir’s Money Claim against Turkish Government. 73. Whatever be the final settlement of the Amiri question and border, the Amir is certainly entitled to compensation by the Turkish Government for his more direct finan cial losses as arising from their disturbing: iht status quo of the period preceding the arrival of this Commission. Our arrival was the.cause of the violent attitude of the Turks, and by not immediately insisting on the restoration of that status quo, His Majesty’s Government is to a certain extent responsible for the losses thereby occasioned to the Amir and his adherents. 74. My telegram of the 12 th June, 1902, and my despatch of the 4th December, 1902, referred to a portion of these losses, and it was only after the restoration of the status quo that 1 was able in my telegram of the 11th March last to give a more less accurate estimate of the Amir’s direct losses from the loss of revenue, damage to property, &amp;c., in his villages south of Kataba, amounting to 400Z., or 4,800 dollars. 75. From the correspondence I notice that at Constantinople this was interpreted as revenue collected by the Turks. I have no means of calculating the amounts exacted by the Turks, the 400Z. (4,800 dollars) representing the revenue which the Turks prevented the Amir from collecting during the period of their disturbance of the status quo. 76. The Secretary of State’s telegram of the 18th March to the Resident stated that the British Ambassador “ was officially assured that orders were being sent tor repayment to the Amir of 400Z., while the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 19th March stated that the British Ambassador had been instructed to use his discretion in the matter, rather leaving it to be inferred that it w T as not being pressed, while again in his telegram of the 18th March to the Foreign Office, the Ambassador spoke of fixing a date for payment by the Turkish Government and of “taking our own measures to recover” the sum, if not paid by that date. . t ^ x , 77. The evacuation of Jalela by the Turkish Government was but a very tardy recognition of the Amiri and British claim to the country which it dominated, and left a great portion of the Amir’s country in such a disturbed state that he has had considerable expense in reducing matters to order again. There is no question of asking the Sultan’s Government to recoup the Amir for such outlay, but his previous losses, such as the 400Z.12 revenue, should most certainly, I think, be made good to him by the Turkish Government or its Y 6 men authorities. 78. There are two other items of the Amirs losses where the lurkish Government’s direct responsibility was involved, and where consequently a good claim for indemnity to the Amir lies. One cf these was when the Turkish Chief Commissioner proceeded, with a force and two guns to Lakmat-as-Sallah, ousted the Amir’s Representative, and installed the Turkish nomine*-, Seid Ahmad Mohsin, the subsequent author ofinfl a mmatory letters, who, with his followers, aided by the Turks, plundered, destroyed, or removed the property I of the Amir’s agent and his relatives. ' | 79 . On the restoration of the status quo the Amir had to make good these losses in great part out of his own pocket, and the Turks should certainly be compelled to refund him the amount. J have been to great pains to obtain accurate estimates of the Lakmat- as-Sallah losses, and I herewith forward detailed accounts of the same, vouching for their being rather under than over the exact totals. They amount in all to 5,841f dollars, which at the present rate of exchange are equivalent to rupees 7,216 : 5 : 0, or 481/, 4s. 80. Another item of loss for which the Turkish Government was directly responsible was the Amir’s Mafari loss of revenue, &amp;c. Resume. 85. While leaving the question of Amara, Humar, Shurman, and Janadiya to the appreciation and decision of His Majesty’s Government, the foregoing shows that, if we surrender our claims to Mares (as 1 am disposed to do), three solutions of the present difficulties of the Amiri border suggest themselves:— 86 . —( 1 .) To delimit on the basis o( the green line, with its inaccuracies and unavoid able detects. For this it is indispensable— (a.) To include the Dakkam portion of Fajra as a whole. (b.) To include the village of A1 Ukla. . , (c.) To draw the line close round Kataba, as in paragraphs 71 and 72, so as to in uce the l urks to remove their administrative centre back to Nadira. (d.) To secure payment to the Amir by the Turks of his losses, amounting to 11,231/. 45 ., or 73,04if dollars. This would be a settlement very generous to the Turks, and would give an unsa is Mafari. His Majesty’s Government will recollect the Turkish occupation last year of the disputed territory of Jihaf, whence a Turkish force with one of the Commissioners proceeded to Mafari and ejected the Amir’s people, doing considerable damage to their property. 81. MaGri, as proved by Documents 16 and 17, sent with my No. ISO of the 2nd December, 1902, is the property of the Amir; and his loss of revenue, &amp;c., owing to the Turkish usurpation in 1902-1903, amounts to 3,600 dollars, or 300/. 82. The three foregoing items, amounting in all to 14,241f dollars, or 1,181/. 4s., represent the Amir’s direct losses occasioned by the disturbances ot the status quo of October 1901, and in no way include his many indirect losses during or before that period, e.g., his stipulated annual payments from Jihaf, Dakkam, &amp;c. Their refund to the Amir seems a sine qud non of any comprehensive settlement. Similarly, should the Turkish usurpation of the Yubi, Haiki, and Kataba be condoned, such condonation should be contingent on the Turks paying to the An ir the amount of revenue he was entitled to draw from them during the last thirty years, throughout which they have, without any title, enjoyed the usufruct of these places. 1 have given the details above (see paragraph 23), and the total sum, omitting the Amir’s share, o/ the Kataba market dues amounts to 58,800 dollars, or 9,000/., i.e., 147,000 rupees at the average old rate of exchange of 2^ rupees to the dollar. 83. The three claims arising from the disturbance of the status quo, together with the Yubi, Haiki, and Kataba items, would thus amount to 73,041J dollars, or 11,231/. 45 . 84 . If paid like the recent Italian Red Sea piracy claims, i.e., by the Yemen authorities, the latter would prefer to pay to this Commission or some other Representative of the British Government than direct to the Amir.feature b ° rder ’ runnin g across a P lain &gt; and not sharply defined by any well-marked natural u .^° secure rectification of the broken portion of the green line implied by the restoration to the Amir of the Yubi and Haiki villages of Fajra, with Katabaf the payments to the Amir being correspondingly reduced to 1,181/. 45 ., or 14,241f dollars ^ Ibis would not increase the responsibilities of the Amir or His Majesty’s Government and would give, instead of the dotted portion of the green line, a natural frontier of a loftv mountain range as opposed to a line running across a plain. The Amir’s rights to all three, as shown above, are clear and unanswerable, while the rights of the Turks are merely those of usurpers. They have no officials or other vestige of administrative control in the Haiki or Yubi villages, so that their withdrawal of the two or three officials and their present small force at Kataba would, ipso facto, yield the above frontier. u shoul( ^ P er haps, explain that the term “Fajra,” which means “cutting” or gorge, is applied to the country above the Tiban gorge between Mounts Hosha and Jihat; and the word “ Fajra,” according to the Turkish interpretation, is applied to the Hakkam, i ubi, and Haiki: so that Yubi and Haiki w'ould be comprised by “ Fajra,” mentioned in Documents 7, 8 , and 13 attached to my Memorandum of the 2 nd December, 1902. (3.) The third solution would be to include the Haiki and Yubi within our boundary, leaving Kataba to the Turks in the way indicated in ( 1 ) (c), in which case the Amir’s indemnity would be 8,981/. 4s., or 61,04If dollars. 90. Solution ( 2 ) would unquestionably be the most satisfactory. For it would not only give a frontier the sharply-defined natural configuration of which would make it well- nigh impossible for the Turks to transgress—thus putting a permanent stop to their scandalous behaviour during the last thirty years—but it would, moreover, restore to the Amir the real limits within which, in 1873, his predecessors exercised direct control. The Turks would, no doubt, resort to the same tactics of “ bluff” as last year, but would not carry them to anything like the same length. The Sultan’s Government must recognize the justice of the Amir’s rights as set forth in the documents quoted, and, though'their Commissioners here may misrepresent matters, they know well the weakness of their case; while the Sultan, judging by the British Ambassador at Berlin’s telegram of the 16th March last, would not get much foreign encouragement. 91. The green line drawn at Dthala under considerable disadvantages, and from apparently wilfully inaccurate Turkish information, had as its basis the Selat Kataba, with its tributaries, and the Dakkam border. A rectification of it (especially the dotted portion), taking in the Haiki and Yubi villages, is inconsiderable, as their lands extend only from 2 to some 7 miles beyond it, their villages lying between the tributaries of the Selat Kataba. 92. I he part of the green line between Lakmat-es-Shub and Kataba was under stood to be the border between Amiri territory and Mares, our claims to which district, with its forty villages, we propose to surrender to the Turks. The latter admit that the villages of A 1 Ukla, Huan Zinia, and Reshan are not Mares. They must consequently be Amiri. The Selat Kataba runs north, and not (as wrongly asserted by the Turks) south, of Kataba ; while the green line below the supposed point of junction of the two water courses running to the north and to the south of that place, and down through the Dakkam, was left merely dotted or broken. 93. The idea may occur to His Majesty’s Government that there is no finality in this question of the Aden hinterland boundary. This is not so ; and now that, since the evacuation of Jalela and the admission by the Sultan of our claims to all sections of Yafa, this Commission is in a position to form some general idea of that frontier, I may point out that the important part of that frontier is the stretch from Kataba to the south of Taiz. 94. To the north-east, the international or Turkish aspect of the question was settled in principle by the Irade obtained by the Constantinople Embassy on the 13th February last, acknowdedging all sections of the Yafa as within the British sphere, and, if Treaty arrangements are made with Beda and Behan, the difficulties up to the border of Rada ought to be mostly internal (i.e., with the tribes, and not with the Turks), the Aulaki and Hadramut being secured against outside interference or encroachment. 95. To the south-west, the Haushabi and Subehi tribes are already acknowledged by the Turks as two of the “ nine cantons ” under British influence, so that our difficulties along their borders ought to be merely matters of minor rectifications, while, as regards the low unhealthy sandy plains towards Sheikh Said, once the point where the boundary- line abuts on the sea is fixed, a mile or two inland one way or the other will not matter much either to the Turkish or British Government.

There can be little doubt that the Turks, who have harassed the Haiki and Yubi under our very eyes, will, after the departure ot the Comm 1S sion, make both ttese small clans, if left on the Turkish side, feel the full weight of their resentment at the viHagers having manifested a desire to claim their old allegiance to the Amirs. This won d not fail to re-act unfavourably on the Commission, especially in the Yafa district. The Yafa owing to their isolated situation and the wild mountainous nature of their country, OTe exceptionally narrow-minded, fickle, and credulous of false or exaggerated rumours, and I feel convinced'that our dealings with them would be much smoother if we could point to the Amir’s territory as an example of prosperity and contentment resulting from t presence beg to p 0 j nt ou t the somewhat peculiar conditions under which this Commission'is supposed to work. In the ordinary course, its duty would have been to delimit the boundary on the principle of give-and-take, in a debatable zone previous y surveyed^ This was apparently out of the question in dealing with a Government hke that o^ Turkey, with the result that political work arising from thirty years toleration o Turkish encroachment has been mixed up with and retarded actual delimitation. 102 Survey work in disputed territory under Turkish occupation has been well-mg impossible owW To the peculiar system'of the Turks, which compels them to ngidly exclude us from territory not recognized by their central Government as ours, wh delimitation on the principle of “give-and-take” is also out of the questmn, the Turkis Commissioners being unable to yield an inch beyond what is actually laid down *» -“i the Turkish Government’s proposal for delimitation, and since then mstr^tions tn Commission have been confined to communicating to us the text ot the Imperial orders our Turkish colleagues, obtained with much trouble from the Sultan s t The delays and disadvantages of such a system, with the heavy expenditure it ent Majesty’s Government, are obvious, and the present diffieu ties regarding the ^ rectifications of the green line are entirely the outcome ot the obstructive tactic p by the Turks last year, if not, indeed, during the last thirty years. 104.

Still, though the topo- graphical detail could not be fully shown, all villages which it may be necessarv to include m order to obtain a satisfactory border are comprised within the blue lines. 1 O 0 . Should His Majesty’s Government decide to insist on the Ottoman Government admitting the Amirs claim to these clans, orders to the Turkish Commissioners to recognize the Haiki and Yubi within the British sphere would meet the requirements of the case, as m the instance of the Irade including the Shaibi with the Yafa, bv which the boundary between that district and Mares was practically fixed as far north-east as the iver Bana. The borders of the Amara and Humar are only approximately indicated, as the surveyois were unable to visit any points commanding a good view of that district. 107. It is usual, in laying down a boundarv, to mark it with cairns or pillars. In the case of the Aden hinterland, however, where neither the Turks nor ourselves have any regular administration, it is certain that any artificial marks would be speedily removed by the Arabs on one side or the other, the Turkish Arabs accusing ours of doing so, and vice versa, and would thus be the cause of constant little frontier incidents. Subject to the approval of His Majesty s Government, I would be disposed to mark the boundary merely on a joint map, accompanied by a more or less detailed description of the natural features defining it, such as the villages, water-courses, hills, &amp;c., on either side.

In reply, Mr. Fitzrnaurice says that these villages as well as Fagra, which is mentioned in the Commissioners' telegram No. 261, and the Haiki and Yubi villages have, except since the Turkish usurpa tion, been subject to the Emirs of Dhali for more than a century, and that this fact is shewn con clusively by authentic evidence both oral and written: that [he Marquess of Lansdov/ne, K.

It is evident from this telegram that the Com mission are considerably extending the scope of the delimitation and raising claims and pretensions to territory, which has been in Turkish occupation for the last thirty years. I see no justification for this policy, which would end in dangerously weakening the authority of the Sultan throughout the Yemen or in a serious conflict with the Ottoman Government.

The complaints against the British Commissioners as stated in the Turkish Ambassador's Note of the 11th instant are as follows: !• That the British Commissioners are raising vexatious difficulties in the way of the progress of the work of delimitation notably in connection with the demarcation of the line in the neighbourhood of Kataba. 2. That after the Commission had decided to defer survey operations until the receipt of fresh instructions Colonel Wahab at first proposed to pre pare a map of the country situated at a distance of 2 kilometreskilometres on either side of the green line and that he subsequently insisted on extending this limit to 4i kilometres on the Turkish side. 3. That British soldiers and surveyors had been sent to certain villages in the districts of Dakkam and Kataba outside the line. 4. That Colonel Wahab had insisted on the removal of a Custom House, which had previously been transferred to the Turkish side of the line, on the ground that it was situated in disputed territory. As regards the first two subjects of complaint it may be stated generally that according to the in structions sent to the Turkish Commissioners, as com municated by His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires at ConstantinopleConstantinople on the 13th of February last, it was arranged that 'as regards localities on which the Commissioners may not be able to agree at the time of delimitation they will be reserved for agreement be tween the two Governments'. Subsequently on the 18th of March the Turkish Government agreed 'to proceed with the delimitation, in accordance with the configuration of the land, of the line shown by the British Commissioner on the joint map'. His Majesty's Government have always regarded the green line as merely indicating the approximate extent of the British claim and not as debarring the Com missioners from having full opportunities of ascer tainingascertaining the facts as to the configuration of the ground and basing thereon proposals within reasonable limits to obtain a satisfactory and serviceable frontier. It has never been the intention of His Majesty's Government to propose any extensive or wholesale departures from this line but merely to adopt such modifications of it as would be obviously fair and mutually convenient to both parties on a give and take principle. It is not possible to follow the geographical details of the proposal contained in the Note in re gard to the frontier in the neighbourhood of Kataba but according to tlie information received by His Maj esty's Government it appears that Colonel Wahab has donedone no more than propose that a joint survey should he undertaken hy the two parties to settle the point at issue. This proposal is entirely in accordance with the views of His Majesty's Government as to the principle on which the delimitation should proceed. Colonel Wahah's proposal to survey the country for a short distance on either side of the line seems to have been made with the object of bringing about a settlement on the above principle. Any independent surveys which may have been made by Colonel Wahab in the Dakkam district appear to be entirely justified on the ground that a doubt exists as to the proper limits of Dakkam as is proved by the fact that the frontier is shown in this neighbourhoodon the map by a broken line, the object being to indi cate that the line is only provisional and that the actual facts as to the limits of the territory have still to be ascertained. The British Commissioner is entitled to lull facilities for ascertaining these facts. The information received hy His Majesty's Govern ment as to the establishment of a Turkish Customs post in the Kataba district does not entirely correspond with the account furnished by the Turkish Ambassador. Colonel Wahab has reported that not only has a Customs post been established by the Turkish authorities south of the Selat Kataba in territory which cannot be admitted to be Turkish, but also that excessive HPipqR' exportexport duties have been levied there and that camels belonging to the British Corimissloners have been im properly detained and only released on payment of the excessive duties demanded. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople is in communication with the Turkish Government on this subject. Foreign Office, May 13th, 1903.1^*0) l v/c.

May 15th, 1903. My Lord:- V/lth reference to my telegrams Nos .94 and 95, repeating those I had lately sent to Mr. Fitz- maurice, I have now the honour to enclose herewith a paraphrase of Mr. Fltzmaurice's telegram No.19 in re ply thereto. In order to understand the question, I ought to explain that the Porte, upon being pressed to re tire behind the green line, decided not only to do so . i and to withdraw from Valeli, but apparently to ac cept this line as the frontier, in the hope no doubt that in doing so they would protect themselves from further demands and especially from a demand to in clude Kataba in the Amiri territory. I have frequently explained to the Porte that the green line was meant merely to indicate that the country south of it was in dispute and that whe ther the ultimate frontier should run north or south of the green line must depend upon further examina-nation and tine proofs produced as to ov/ner- I entirely share the opinion expressed in the Secretary of State's telegram of the 4th instant, that no variations from the green line should he osed unless supported hy conclusive evidence ound to he conformable to fair and mutual con venience. I would go still further and say that our Commissioners should only insist upon a readjust ment of the green line for grave reasons such as that its acceptance would leave within Turkish ter ritory villages which are and have always been con sidered as Amiri and subject to the authority of the Emir's nominees or because for topographical or other reasons it would be clearly unsuitable for a permanent frontier. If I obtain permission of His Majesty's Gov ernment to assure the Porte that from friendly feel ings towards the Ottoman Government we waive such claims as we may possess to Kataba - claims which seem wgtzmsiSfiLJ seem to me just now rather doubtful and certainly impolitic - I may be able to persuade the Grand Vi- ziei* oo instruct the Ottoman Commissioners to recog- * nise Ukla as within Amiri country, and also to get certain concessions in regard to Dakkam, if it should be established, contrary to what seems to me evi dence, that it is better to have a land frontier than to accept the Wadi Tiban as the boundary line. But any readjustment of the green line may be outside the Power of the Grand Vizier without the fresh Imperial Irade with its inseparable difficulties and delays, and for various reasons I think it more desirable that the Commissioners should get through with the Amiri boundary as speedily as possible, so as to proceed with the delimitation on the North East to the desert. I do not propose to discuss the frontier ques tion again with the Porte until I receive Your Lord ship's instructions and a new map, which Mr. Fitz- maurice says has been forwarded to me. I shall, however11 however, make strong representations, in respect to Mr* Fitzmaurice*s complaint against the Ottoman Cust oms oi ficial s, and ask for tne ir puni ofuimnt I am glad to he able to report that the Grand Vizier telegraphed yesterday to the Vali of the Ye men instructing him only to levy in future 1 per cent export duty.

Mr. Fitzmaurice requests me to telegraph to Your Excellency aS follows ■With reference to your Telegrams Nos.18 and 19 of the 9th and 10th instant respectively, it will be seen from Colonel Wahab's telegrams Nos .260 to 262 and also No. 256 that the usual distortion of facts appears in the complaint of the Turkish Commissioners The claims to include the villages of Kataba Dak am &amp;c in Amiri are such that without previously submitting the case to His Majesty*s Government as indicated in the India Office telegram of 14th May and in your telegram No.17, it would be impossible for the Com missioners to surrender them. As a basis of delimitation the green line on the map, which was based on Turkish surveys, is unwork able, and a fresh correct map with the full facts v/ill be sent by next mail, but in the meantime we are adopting the line indicated in Your Excellency's tele gram of the 9th No. 18. TheThe village of Dakam including also the few square miles beyond the green line, has always been considered as a whole as being in Amiri terriuOiy. With reference to the telegram from the Resi dent at Aden of the 5th instant, the village of ILo la is not in Maras but in Amiri, and snould remain on our side not only according to the 'configura- of the land' but also as a starting point for line to the North East. The Officials of the Turkish Customs are now intolerable. An Amiri man was killed and two oth ers were dangerously wounded yesterday close to our camp by the Turkish Arab levies, and there are disagreeable incidents daily. The Amiris are being restrained from making reprisals.

The claims of the Amir of Bthali to the villages of Kataba. Dakkam and others are such that they cannot be surrendered by the Commission without submission of the case to Mis Majesty's Government. The green line map, which was drawn from map of Turkish Commission, affords unworkable basis, as indicated in telegram from Constantinople No. 17 and Secretary of State's telegram of 1th May. Full facts and fresh corrected map are being communicated by next mail to Bngland. Meanwhile we are taking line indicated in last paragraph of Constantinople telegram No. 18. Dakkam with its feiv square miles on further side of green line has, as a ivhole, always belonged to the Amiri. The village of TJkla [see Resident at Aden's telegram of hth May) is also Amiri, not Mares, and it should be included in our boundary, both on account of configuration of ground, and to be the starting-point of the delimitation north-eastwards. “ The Turkish Customs still refuse, unless expressly ordered by Constanti nople, to reduce their duties to one per cent, on exports and eight per cent, on imports; the situation is becoming intolerable; incidents occur daily; their Arab levies yesterday killed one of the Amir s men and wounded two dangerously close to our camp.

Sir I. O'Conor expresses the opinion that the difficulties which are being raised by the Turkish Commis sioners are mainly due to their apprehension that the British Commissioners may claim Kataba on behalf of the Amir of Dthali. This apprehension would appear to be founded on idle locont proceedings of the British Commissioners reported in the telegram from the Resident at Aden of the 27th ultimo. Lord Lansdowne had nevencontemplated the possibi- lity of Kataba being included in the territory of the nine The Under Secretary of State, tribes India Office.tribes and during his discussions with the Turkish Ante sador -he has always assumed that it was situated as she 7 I on all the maps which Lord Lansdowno has soon within Turkish territory.

Following received from Wahab for transmission. Sir N. O’Conor has been informed:— “ No. 256, Secret. Joint survey of boundary zone reveals gross, if not wilful, inaccuracy of Turkish topography on which green line was based. Turks declare that their instructions prevent admitting Ukla to be on our side, though we waive all claims to two villages, and though configuration of ground and documentary evidence prove that it is in Amiri limits, while Turks themselves state that it is not in Mares. They similarly contest our claims to the Dakkam as a whole, which was endorsed by Viceroy in his telegram of 6th March. Some hamlet[s], together with principal village, which is also residence of tribal chief, are on the west bank of the Tiban.” It appears from the above that though Turkish Commission has been brought to the point of demarcation, actual demarcation is not progressing.

It was originally understood with regard to the Amiri boundary that the British and Turkish Commissioners should reserve for discussion between their two Governments any points as to ichich they could not agree. The green line in the map, m the view of Mis Majesty's Government, merely indicates approximate extent of British claim, and does not debar the British Commissioners from demanding full opportunities for ascertaining facts, and basing proposals thereon, espe cially in regard to dotted portion of line. They should not, however, propose any variations from green line unless supported by conclusive evidence, nor any re-adjustments unless mutually convenient and obviously fair.

Lord Lansdowne concurs in the views expressed hy the secretary of state for India on the subject of these instructions. The understanding as to the procedure to he followed has been that those points in regard to which the British and Turkish commissioners may he unable to come to an agreement should he reserved for dis—cussion between the two Governments.

From Resident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, 17th March 1903. (Repeated to Secretary of State, Bombay, and Constantinople.) Dthali, 16th March. I have fully discussed situation with Commissioners. It is not satisfactory, although orders contained in Secretary of State’s tele gram of 14th March should effect considerable improvement. Governor of Taiz, in consequence of orders from palace, visited Jalela on 13th, returning to Kataba same evening. He extracted declaration from people against being handed over to Franks, and saying that in such a case they would emigrate from Arah-i-Gumia to some other part of Ottoman dominions. This will he produced probably at Constantinople as genuine petition. Meanwhile, Turkish nominee at Jihaf went to Kataba where he met Governor, and it is reported that his following of about 16 armed Arabs from Turkish territory are at Sarir village on that mountain, where Turkish post was formerly situated. This has appearance of an attempt to upset status quo just restored. It is, in the opinion of Commissioners and myself, highly important that evacuation of Jalela, now demanded by His Majesty’s Government, should be not only complete but unconditional; see also Wahab’s No. 218 in my telegram dated 26th January. I am now convinced that appeals of Turks to religious feeling of tribes are having no small effect. The propaganda is being carried on, and I received at Lahej warning from Sultan to the effect that our own tribes could not he trusted in the event of our showing any weakness at this juncture.

The only policy we consider practicable is that explained in mu telegram of Vdth January, now endorsed by the Besident. Troops will be at once despatched as authorised by you. But we strongly urge the issue of instructions for simultaneous naval demonstration at Hodeida. When all Vthali territory south of the green line shall have been evacuated bu the Turks, it will be easy to conclude treaties with the Yaffai and Aulafa, and the Commission can then begin demarcating to the north-east. T eie is no other alternative policy that we can see that offers a chance of practical result * and if as is reported, a rising has taken place in Yemen, and fifteen battalions of Turkish troops are being sent thither, it is imperative to take immediate action on these lines.From Besident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, (Sth February 1903. (Repeated to Secretary of State, Boynbay, and Constantinople.) p with reference to Secretary of State's telegram of 1st February (?)t)th January ?), Colonel Wahab telegraphs as follows :—“ Turks have, in accordance with Trade, withdrawn their regular troops from the four places, but the Amir of DthaWs authority in them will continue to be disputed by the Turkish noyninees with armed men until Turkish support is permanently withdrawn. As Turkish Commissioners are compelled by their instructions to insist on still demarcating south-eastwards, including Amiri country an d shaibi 8fc., sections of Yaffai, they refuse to demarcate to the north east from Lakhmat-ash-shab. The Yaffai declare that they will oppose by (force H entry of the Turkish party into their territory, or a joint entry; but the British party alone can enter. It is the absolute conviction of both Mr Fitzmaurice and myself that progress north-east is impossible until all Turkish forces have retired from Jalela and disputed territory to beyond the green line, as urged in our telegram of'iZrd January, and by the Viceroy in his telegram ofVdth January.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, \8th March 1903, {Repeated to Resident, Aden.)

On ISth Governor of Taiz, ivho had received orders to that effect from the Palace, visited Jalela, returning the same day to Kataba, after extracting from the people a declaration against their being handed over to Franks, in which event, they said, they would leave Arab-i-Gumia and migrate to some other part of Ottoman dominions. At Constantinople this will be taken probably as genuine petition. Meanwhile it is reported that the following of the Turkish nominee at Jihaf consisting of about 16 armed Arabs from Turkish territory, are at the village of Sarir on Rebel Jehaf, where the Turkish post was formerly situated; and that the nominee himself went to Kataba and met there the Governor of Taiz. This appears to be an attempt by the Turks to upset the status quo, which has just been restored. In my opinion, and in that of the Commissioners, it is highly important that the evacuation of Jalela, now demanded by His Majesty's Government, should be not only complete, but also unconditional. See my telegram of 2§th January reporting Wahab’s telegram No. 218.

(Repeated to Secretary of State, and to Sis Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople ). n t ° 1 S( p;el«ry of State’s teleyram to Viceroy of \Uh January Colonel Waliab sends following message, dated 23rd January, No. 218. ' Sir N 0 Conor appears to have been misinformed by the Sultan. The Imperial Trade,which the Minister for War communicated to Abdulla Basha the Governor of Yemen and which the Turkish Commissioners received on 20th instant, contains instructions on four points, as follows: “Firstly. That the irregular levies should be disbanded. “ Secondl y- That while any alteration of the present status of the four evacuated points should be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two Governments, the existing rights of the Sheikhs of Bthali should not be interfered with. The instructions on this point say nothing as to the restoration of the status quo of October 1901 proper date of which should be January 1901,/or it was then that ™ 'iT k pr ° ha ^ l y m consequence of the suggestion for delimitation ade to the Forte by the Ambassador at Constantinople in May 1900 commenced their recent aggressions on Amiri territory. The above clause excluding Mafare, Jihaf 8fc., will nullify any orders that may be issued respecting restoration of status at the date mentioned; it should therefore be expressly cancelled when subsequent orders are “ Thirdl y- Tn ‘p the Yaffai are recognised as included among the nine cantons disputed tracts are to be reserved. In accordance with these instructions the Turks will claim for reserved decision between the two Governments, the Shaibi and several other Yaffai sub-tribes to the north-east, ichich the Sultan claims as being not Yatfai but integral parts of the Turkish districts of Kataba and Rada. ' “ Fom ' th p' That the Commissioners should proceed with the delimitation north-eastwards towards the desert. There is no mention of Lakmat- as-shub or other starting point.The Turkish Commissioners are prevented by their instructions from admitting that the Aulaki are among the nine cantons. The Turks having in the Amiri village of Jalela troops and guns considerably in excess of the normal garrison of oO men m addition to the Commission’s escort, can render progress impossible; and seeing that Sis Majesty's Government have refused to admit Turkish rights over Jalela in their Despatch of\m August winch Sir N. O Conor communicated to the Porte, I would venture most strongly to urge now that Sis Majesty’s Government are aware of the j a cl sal out the Amin border explained in the Commissioners’ report of the 2nd December, that it is absolutely necessary, in view of (; r ff c,lt ) events, and especially of the fresh instance of Turkish bad jaith already pointed out in this telegram, to insist on the Turks withdrawing unconditionally all their forces beyond the green line of the map attached to the Commissioners' Report. Mr. FitzmaurirJ* repor t of the 22nd December pointed to the same conclusion ; and 1 am convinced that unless this is done, there is no way out of the present deadlock, which is entailing so much expense'' I understood that when His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople stipulated that there should be no interference with the rights of the Amiri as exercised previous to October 1901, it was intended to restore the status quo ^ the date of the Porte’s proposal for demarcation as a nec„ preliminary to joint delimitation, labile the interference of the Turks before that date was to be left to be dealt with in the final settlement. I respect fully submit that the hopelessness of proceeding further on the above lines is proved by the Turkish Government s continued evasion of their promises and by the obstruction cf their local authorities ; and I venture to hope that SisMaieslu’s Government will accept, and will take steps to oblige the Turkish Govern- TfmTfoAfi^fr of mhaH territory wUch has ieenh yForeign Office, ^Kauruij / to , 190 % Hi Sir / am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying ho • MaHut /5 cLtkj cLtluM'dadrK . &amp; A / a* 1 ' 'i 05 ’ 7//^ Under-Secretary of State,not, toy a Bcrwuit believe that the Rritlafo COKr.iaaion- ore deal -ed to intcr^ae needless obstacles In the ■'t-y t,i the progress of the 4eliraitstton.

In consequence you are instructed to demand that Zakhariya Bey should be withdraivn from the Commission; that, in accordance with the promise made by the Forte but disregarded by the Turkish officers, Nasir Makbil should be immediately removed from the frontier, and that Al Jalela and any other posts within the green line marked on the Commissions map now occupied by the Turks should be completely evacuated by all Turkish troops and levies. By this evacuation, which has become absolutely necessary for the security of the British Commissioners and for the undisturbed pro secution of the ivork of delimitation, the ulterior discussion of any evidence which the Turkish Government may wish to produce as to their title to territory within the green line will not be prejudiced.

If there is delay in finally settling the Amiri border, the status quo now re-established, which is precarious, may be upset. Verification has revealed that south of green line there is no longer any trace of Turkish authority, outside of the village of Jalela ; and country between Dthali and Kataba is, until definite confirmation of Amir’s authority, a no man’s land which neither side can control. Such an anomalous situation must lead to incidents necessitating frequent return of Commission from north-east Excepting only Jalela, which it is probable that the Turks, under present pressure, would be easily induced to evacuate, the Amiri border is now rip tacto established. , , n . £&gt;• fh Off 1 ^ ___ fatyvA-toj J 4 1IThig Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA AND ARABIA.

I had the honour to convey the substanT of I now 1 ^ 10 ^^ ^ Lordshi P in teIe § ram No - 31 of yesterday’s date, and The reservation regarding Jalela which is made in these instructions seems to me not unnatural considering that we have condoned the Turkish occunation of that place since 1885, and in other respects the instructions now sent ^ demands made by His Majesty s Ambassador before his departure. I venture, [here- ore, to submit to your Lordship that the British Commissioners should be held to carry out their instructions to proceed to Lakmat-es-Shub and invite the Turkish aV° m there l without timing the evacuation of Jalela as a p elimmary condition. The apprehensions apparently entertained by Colonel Wahab that the personal safety of the British Commissioners would be endangered by leaviim a Turkish garrison m their rear seems to me hardly warranted, at least so far as the Turkish regular troops _ are concerned. A countervailing British force wonlrl naturally be left at Dtkali, but there is no reason to suppose that the Ottoman Com missioners or the troops under their command are not absolutely amenable to the orders they receive from the Vali and from Constantinople, and the position of Turkish ^ 18 so Yul ^ mh \ e aml P recarious that ^ ^ almost inconceivable Tow 6 0tt0man Go f \ em ^. ent w , ould hazard it by allowing an attack on the British Commission or upon their lines of communication. So long, therefore, as an adequate British force remains m the Aden Hinterland, and ships of war are available which c n at short notice be sent to Mokha ^ and Hodeidah to prevent the arrival of rein- orcements, I think the British Commission need only provide against eossiblv hostile action of the tribes themselves, notably the Yaffai. ^ ° A 7 hostile .They will of course in accordance with their instructions, ascertain before Lakma t hat tlG f mir ° f Mali’s authority has been effectively re-established m all places from which he has been ousted since the appointment of the Commission, and the question of Jalela and the other places occupied by the TuiKs m IS 80 can be dealt with after the frontier from Lakmat-es-Shub to the desert has been finally demarcated. With the Amir of Dthali established at Lakmat-es-Shub and Lakmat-es-Saleh tho posiLcm of a smal military post at Jalela would be somewhat precarious in case of disturbance, and the Turks may therefore be ready to give it up for a small qmd^ pro quo, such as a rectification of our green line on the joint map, which would enable them to retain the custom-house at Sanah.

My Lord, Constantinople, February 9, 190S. 1 ±1A V b the honour to report that, in accordance with the authorization given me in your Lordships telegram No. 21 of the 7th instant, 1 called to-dav on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Mr. Block, and read to his Excellency a French version of the aide-memoire, copy of which I have the honour to inclose, leaving with his Excel lency copies of the English text and the French translation. * I thought it best to omit from this communication any mention of the Turkish reinforcements, or the action which His Majesty’s Government proposed to take in regard to-them ; hut in order to convey the latter information to his Excellency in a confidential manner without risk of exaggeration or misunderstanding, I read and* left with him an informal statement in French, copy of which is also inclosed. In reply to the first communication Tewfik Pasha again called attention to the com plaints of the Turkish Commissioners that their British colleagues now refused to proceed with the delimitation towards the north-east, and calling on Nbury Bey, the Secretary- General for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, caused him to read to me Musurus Pasha’s telegraphic report of a recent conversation with your Lordship, and the reply sent to his Excellency, which was in much the same terms as the message conveyed to me bv Yussuf at Aslant, which I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my telegram JNo. 27 of that day. v b In discussing the question of re-establishing the Amir of Dthali’s authority, his Excellency said that as the Turkish troops had been withdrawn from the places claimed by him, there was now no means of forcing the local Arabs to acknowledge his authority. ° I replied that we had reason to believe that the petty Sheikhs who now held those places were Turkish nominees, and that I could not doubt that the Ottoman Com- jmssioners had sufficient influence to withdraw them. Should they be unable to do so a solution would be furnished by the action proposed by His Majesty’s Government. As- regards the refusal of the British Commissioners to proceed with the demarcation towards he north-east, I said that this was natural since the Turkish Commission refused to beffin the work from Lakmat-es-Shub, and also that it was explained by the fact that thev could not safely leave the country in their rear occupied by Shiekhs who had shown then- hostility by firing on British detachments. The re-establishment of the Amir of .Dthali’s authority had, therefore, become a necessary preliminary to the prosecution of the work. With regard to the dispatch of fifteen battalions from Syria his Excellency said that the ganison in the Yemen was relieved about once in two years, and that this explained the large number of men now sent. He added that it would be a great hard ship to the time-expired soldiers if they were debarred from returning to their homes by the non-arrival of their relief. This corresponds in general with the information which I have obtained from His Majesty’s Consuls in Syria, as summarized in my despatch No. 71 of to-day’s date. 1 I urged upon his Excellency the necessity of instructing the Ottoman Commissioners without delay to comply with the demands which their British colleagues had been instructed to make, and pointed out that our action was in no way aggressive, and that we now claimed no more than we had done from the beginning. His Excellency promised to take the matter in hand at once. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. B. WHITEHEAD. [1834 2—1]Inclosure 1 in Itfo. 1.

At Mafare their nominee returned and made his peace with the Amir of Tthali, this re-establishing the status quo. The Turkish nominee at Jihaf has not yet returned ; I have discovered a letter recently written by the Turks addrestei to him ivith official designation as Turkish functionary. Both Mafare and Jihaf districts, as was already the case with Ahmade, Mehrabi, etc., have returned voluntarily to their allegiance to the Amir of Dthali, making it thus, in my opinion, impossible to hand them over to the Turks when the Amiri question is settled. “As to Lakmat-as\-Saleh I shall, as soon as possible, verify whether it has been evacuated. “ In my No. 234 reference is made to a peremptory written demand by the Turks, which is locally interpreted as an ultimatum, and by which the Turk, contrary to their instructions urging non-resistance, evidently intended to hinder the re-establishment of the status quo. I think that official notice should be taken at Constantinople of this demand.’’From Resident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, (? 22nd) February 1903.

Mr. Fitz- maunce pointed out the significance of this in his report of 22nd December “ se ™ ls a Vfopitious moment, now that the question of Yaffai with Shaibi is practically settled, to complete the Sultans recognition of the list of nine tribes presented to the Porte in 1873 by obtaining an Irade specifying Amiri and all sections of the Aulaki. x jy y “ Mr. Fitzmaurice is at Dthali. I am sending this telegram from Mafare where, m accordance with the Secretary of State s telegrams of IMh and lSth I arrived yesterday. The Turks have sent me a peremptory written demand to withdraw immediately. If they attempt to translate this into action before the arrival of our reinforcements, it will be imperative to take immediate action at sea to prevent reinforcements reaching them at Kataba.' Mr. Fitzmaurice in a supplementary telegram states that Turks are profoundly, though wrongfully, irritated, but at present there are no signs of activity on their part. I do not think that they will give trouble. The situation appears to be that Colonel TFahab has demanded compliance with the conditions and the Turkish Commissioners apparently mean to comply with the instructions reported in Mr. Whitehead's telegram of 13th. It is satisfactory as far as it goes that the Turkish Commissioners should withdraw to the neighbourhood of Kataba and reduce their Jalela garrison, but I concur with Colonel Wahab that a protest is required against the orders describing Jalela as a military post in Ottoman territory. The difficulty of visiting Mafare and Jabal Jihaf was pointed out in Colonel Wahab's telegram of (?)13th February. Probably it was not the intention of His Majesty's Government that he should carry out his instructions literally if risk was involved of tipsetting affairs tvhich otherwise were progressing as desired. Nevertheless after the way the Turks behaved to us there appears to be no call for their present display of irritation.I think with regard to the restoration of the Amir's authority, and future safety of our communications, that, after the Turkish Commissioners have removed to the neighbourhood of Kataba and the British to Lakhmat-ash- Shub, the proper position for the main body of the force would be about Mvnadi, or the north of it, and, with the reduction of Jalela force, there ivould probably not be much difficulty in effecting the restoration of Amir's authority. As to our own communications, we must of course take care of them m country which we do not recognise as Turkish. If I am permitted to proceed to Bthali, 1 will look after communications asWahab moves away; but, as I have already ventured to point out, unless Bthali territory is evacuated and treaty made with the tribes, delimitation north-eastwards involves risk. It does not seem to me to be sufficient partially to restore Amir's authority, as is now contemplated ; and I stronqly support the Amir s appeal, that before we proceed further his territory should be settled. Ihis policy has been consistently advocated by Colonel Wahab and myself, and has been powerfully urged by the Viceroy. As survey and examination of the country will in any case take some time, 1 think that, while the settlement of Bthali territory was proceeding, it would be quite possible to send a survey party with an officer of the Commission along the Yaffai border, the Turks doing the same on their border. This would clear the way for the demarcation north-eastwards.Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake this telegram, to communicate imniptlmtely with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Pnder Secretary of State COPY OF TELEGRAM FROM 7 i ‘ / p.-.-f—' / Received at London Office 1iDepartments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

P. — Aden Delimitation. I have received Secretary of State’s telegrams of YUh and have transmitted them to Colonel Wahab, and am awaiting his reply. On 12th February I advised him to demand that the Turkish Commissioners should comply with the conditions, giving them four days to do so; and I privately suggested to Colonel Wahab that he might insist on the reduction of the Turkish force at Jalela to its original strength of 30 or 40 men as a part of the status quo. This appears to me justifiable, and is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary to a peaceful solution. Rritish force at Dthali on l§th was about 750 infantry, of whom 400 were British, and Abbottabad JRountain Battery, but Colonel TFahab preferred to wait for further reinforcements. Dthali will be for some time political and military centre of Aden Frotectorate, and I think it would be well if I were to proceed there as soon as reinforcements have started. It seems to me that matters have passed beyond the sphere of Delimitation Commission, bid the Commissioner s functions would revive as soon as delimitation actually commences. „ JWl* ^ 2I /4j S ' k Zx, J ^ 1 . lew G/sfo} /185 .—From Resident, Aden, to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople, 1&amp;th December 1902.

In anticipation of its arrival the Turks have reinforced their Jalela and Kataba garrisons, increasing the former to 500 men with 6 guns, and the latter to 340 men with 2 guns. Consequently they now have near Rthali a force considerably superior to ours, especially in guns, as we have only four obsolete 1-pounders against their 8 modern breech-loading guns. Wahab draws special attention to the increase of the Turkish forces at Jalela, in territory which is not admitted to be Turkish, the garrison being now largely in excess of what can be considered necessary for the Com missioners escort.

My inquiries confirmed the statements made 5y Majoi Davies in his Report submitted by you to the Bombay Government under your letter, dated the 20th November, 1901, and as there was no time for any action to | be taken on it before the appointment of this Commission, I understood that you wished the questions referred to therein to be dealt with in the general settlement of 0U1 ^ ai ^' ^. s result, I deemed it my duty to point out the grave disadvantages i any demarcation based on the actual situation, and to recommend a line which would, 1 believe, insure the objects aimed at by His Majesty’s Government, viz., the salety of Aden and the prevention for the future of Turkish interference in the affairs of the protected tribes, and which would not be incompatible with the repeated promises of British Residents to uphold the Ameer’s rights. 3. The encroachments by the Turks beyond the line accepted by His Majestv’s Government is not a matter m doubt. Major Davies reported the establishment shortly before his visit, of a Turkish post on the Jabal Shahad or Suheb, south-east of Jalela, completely barring the roads from Dthala to the north and east, Jabal Mafari was occupied actually during the sitting of this Commission, and under circumstances vnicli compelled me to break off communication with the Turkish Commissioners; p d m r uld * es .P ectfull y submi t that the retirement of the Turks from these places s ould be preliminary, and not subsequent, to the tracing of the line. .

As Turkish Commissioners are compelled by their instructions to insist on still demarcating south-eastwards, including Amiri country and Shaibi, fyc., sections of Yaffai, they refuse to demarcate to the north east from Lakhmat-ash-shab. The Yaffai declare that they ivill oppose by (force ?) entry of the Turkish party into their territory, or a joint entry ; but the British party alone can enter.

He is note in London and awaits your reply?’From Resident, Aden, to Government of Bombay, 26^/i January 1903. {Repeated to Secretary of State, and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople ). V— Referring to Secretary of States telegram to Viceroy of IQth January, Colonel Wahab sends following message, dated ‘ISrd January, No. 2L8. “ Sir N. O'Conor appears to have been misinformed by the Sultan. The Imperial Trade, which the Minister for War communicated to Abdulla Rasha, the Governor of Yemen, and ivhich the Turkish Commissioners received on 2i)th instant, contains instructions on four points, as folloivs :— “ Firstly. That the irregular levies should be disbanded. “ Secondly. That while any alteration of the present status of the four evacuated points should be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two Governments, the existing rights of the Sheikhs of Bthali should not be interfered with. The instructions on this point say nothing as to the restoration of the status quo of October 1901, proper date of ivhich should be January 1901,/or it was then that the Turks, probably in consequence of the suggestion for delimitation made to the Porte by the Ambassador at Constantinople in May 1900, commenced their recent aggressions on Amiri territory. The above clause excluding Mafare, Jihaf 8fc., will nullify any orders that may be issued respecting restoration of status at the date mentioned; it should therefore be expressly cancelled when subsequent orders are issued. “ Thirdly. While the Yaffai are recognised as included among the nine cantons, disputed tracts are to be reserved. In accordance ivith these instructions the Turks will claim for reserved decision between the two Governments, the Shaibi and several other Yaffai sub-tribes to the north-east, which the Sultan claims as being not Yaffai, but integral parts of the Turkish districts of Kataba and Rada. “ Fourthly. That the Commissioners should proceed with the delimitation north-eastwards towards the desert. There is no mention of Lakmat- as-shub or other starting point. The Turkish Commissioners are prevented by their instructions from admitting that the Aidaki are among the nine cantons. The Turks having in the Amiri village of Jalela troops and guns considerably in excess of the normal garrison of 30 men in addition to the Commission's escort, can render progress impossible ; and seeing that His Majesty's Government have refused to admit Turkish rights over Jalela in their Despatch oflSth August, which Sir N. O' Conor communicated to the Porte, I would venture most strongly to urge, now that His Majesty's Government are aware of the facts clout the Amiri border explained in the Commissioners' report of the 2nd December, that it is absolutely necessary, in view of {f recent) events, and especially of the fresh instance of Turkish bad faith already pointed out in this telegram, to insist on the Turks withdrawing unconditionally all their forces beyond the green line of the map attached to the Commissioners' Report. Mr. Fitzmaurice's report of the 22nd December pointed to the same conclusion ; and 1 am convinced that unless this is done, there is no way out of the present deadlock, which is entailing so much expense'' I understood that when His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople stipulated that there should be no interference with the rights of the Amiri as exercised previous to October 1901, it was intended to restore the status quo at the date of the Porte's proposal for demarcation as a necessary preliminary to joint delimitation, while the interference of the Turks before that date was to be left to be dealt with in the final settlement. I respectfully submit that the hopelessness of proceeding further on the above lines is proved by the Turkish Government's continued evasion of their promises and by the obstruction cf their local authorities ; and I venture to hope that HisMajesty's Government will accept, and will take steps to oblige the Turkish Govern ment to respect, the boundary of Dthali territory which has been indicated by the British Commissioners.Departments are requested, if thry suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to ctnemvnicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

The execution of the first has been delayed on various vexatious and untenable pretexts, but the note of the Ottoman Government ot the 1st November, 1902, founded upon an Imperial Iradd, is binding upon the Porte, and however much, now that they fully understand its importance, they mav dislike its terms, they cannot get out of it, and sooner or later it must be carried into execution. megalar levies in the places occupied by the troops, but I am not without hope that ordeis wiL be sent for their disbandment, which will, in due course, he followed bv the lesumption as such authority as the Emir of Dhali enjoyed previous to the proposal for delimitation of the frontier. Mi. lutzmaurice, prompted, no doubt, by a more intimate acquaintance with the local situation, urges that the Ottoman troops should be compelled to retire from Jelale. It may be necessary ultimately to press this point, upon which His Majesty’s Government have formally reserved their rights, in order to get a satisfactorv frontier, and to avoid the intrigues and conflict of interests which the Turkish enclave in the Amin country encourages.

Mr. Whitehead to the Marquess of Lansdowne .— {Received January 26.) (No. 31.) My Lord 0 . ^ , Constantinople, January 19, 1903. WI1H reference to Sir Nicholas O’Conor’s telegram No. 6 of the 14th instant I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith copy of a Memorandum by Mr. Block, First Dragoman to this Embassy, reporting that he had seen a copy of that part ot the decision of the Council of Ministers of the 7th instant which sets forth the instructions to be sent to the Ottoman Commissioners on the Aden frontier, but that, as there were two serious omissions in this document, he had refused to receive it and had asked that the attention of the Minister Fo&amp;ign Affairs should be called to the fact that it did not correspond to the promise given to His Majesty’s Ambassador. I also have the honour to inclose translation, as communicated to this Embassy by the Sublime Porte late on the 17th instant, of that part of the above decision of the Council of Ministers upon which the instructions which have been sent to the Ottoman Commissioners are founded. This translation, however, does not include the preamble mentioned by Mr. Block, in which the words “ to proceed to Lakmat-es-Shub ” and (S status quo as it existed before the formation of the Ottoman Commission ” are correctly given as part of Sir Nicholas O’Conor’s demand. During the interview I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 17th instant, and which I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my telegram No. 11 of that date, his Excellency tried to qualify these omissions as immaterial, on the ground that, since the Commissioners were instructed to demarcate in a north easterly direction up to the desert, and the Yaffai were recognized as one of the nine cantons, the route to be followed was clear, and it was unnecessary to mention a particular point of departure. As regards the Amir of Dthali’s authority, his Excellency stated that, as the Ottoman Commission was instructed to withdraw the Arab levies from the four points in dispute, they would no longer be in a position to prevent the Amir of Dthali from exercising his authority there. Hakki Bey, the Legal Adviser to the Porte, who had been called in by his Excellency to consult, stated the Turkish point of view far more frankly, and let it be seen that these omissions were intentional. In regard to Lakmat-es-Shub, he stated that that place was undoubtedly on the Turkish side, and that as the frontier would not pass there, it was unnecessary for the Commissioners to proceed thither. Their point of departure towards the north-east w'ould be some place, to be agreed upon by them, between Lakmat-es-Shub and Dthali, and they would leave the Yaffai on the British side. I suspected in this an intention to maintain that the Shaibi, whom the British Commissioners claim as a sub-tribe of the Yaffai, are not included in the nine cantons, but did not like to raise the question until that intention was more clearly shown. As regards the Amir of Dthali’s rights in the four places recently evacuated by the Ottoman troops, Hakki Bey said that the village Sheikhs were quite able to maintain order there alone, and strongly deprecated the Amir being allowed to resume the exercise of his authority in them, as that would prejudge the question, which was reserved for further direct negotiation between the two Governments after the frontier towards the north-east had been demarcated. In conclusion, Hakki Bey said that the whole territory in dispute did not exceed 20 square miles, and that, considering the extent of the two Empires, this was a verv trivial matter, and should not present so much difficulty.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 5, Confidential, of the 6th instant, I have the onour to report that, according to the statement of Tewfik Pasha, a Mazbata was resented to the Sultan by the Council of Ministers on the 7th instant, approving of ategorical and immediate orders being sent to the Yemen authorities in accordance with re demands I had submitted to the Porte about the Aden delimitation. I inquired of Tewfik Pasha yesterday whether the Trade had been issued, and 3minded his Excellency that I must have a copy of the instructious sent to the Turkish lommissioners for communication to the British Delegates. Tewfik Pasha replied that the Sultan was considering the question, but that the rade had not yet reached the Porte. He would, however, remind the Sultan’s First ecretary without delay that the matter was very urgent, and that he hoped the Sultan’s inction would be given before I left for England on the 14th. I sent Mr. Block to the Palace this morning to make further inquiries, but all he Duld extract from lahsin Pasha was that &lt;c The Sultan will do what is required.” I thought it well to put on what pressure I could to get this phase of the negotiations sttled before I left, and I did not conceal from His Majesty that if I failed I would be bliged to report to your Lordship that I had no further hope of settling the question in a ■iendly way. Mr. Block has embodied his conversation with the First Secretary in a Memorandum, spy of which I have the honour to inclose herewith. It is possible that the Sultan will at the last moment issue his trade, and inform me ersonally that he has done so. I hope to leave at 1'30 by the Orient Express to-morrow, ut His Majesty has sent me word that he desires to see me at Yildiz at 11 o’clock, and may possibly be again obliged to defer my departure. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Block. IN accordance with instructions, I called to-day upon the Sultan’s First Secretary, nd asked if His Imperial Majesty had issued an Irade confirming the decision of the 'ouncil of Ministers with regard to the instructions that your Excellency had requested lould be sent to the Ottoman Commissioners at Aden. The First Secretary replied in ie vaguest and most unsatisfactory manner, and I had to explain to him, what he knew erfectly well, that I meant the decision taken by the Council of Ministers on Wednesday ist, the 7th instant, which embraced the four points on which instructions should be iven, viz., ct the disbanding of the irregular troops left behind after the regular had racuated the four districts in the Dhali country; ” “ the immediate departure of the ’urkish Commission by the direct road to Lakmat-es-Shoub, and the taking in hand of ie delimitation from that place to the north-east to the desert; ” ec the recognition of the affi as one of the nine cantons;” and “the non-interference with the Sheikh of Dhali i the exercise of his rightful authority in those districts where he had hitherto exercised : before the arrival of the Ottoman Commission, 1901.” Tahsin Pasha still said he did not remember ihe decision of the Council of Ministers, diich was manifestly untrue, since the Foreign Minister had spoken to him about it both n Saturday and Sunday, and had written to him on Monday, at your request, asking for reply; but he would look up the papers, and if there was any such document from the [1804 1J 'ERSIA AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL.— Porte, he would submit it to the Sultan ; and as his whole attitude was most unsatis factory, and he was evidently shuffling, I said that your Excellency had instructed me to inform him, and to beg him to submit to the Sultan, that, “ if the Irade was not issued, and His Majesty did not see you before your departure, you wished him to be toV^hat, in view of the obstruction and bad faith shown during the last fifteen montlX by the Ottoman Government, you would be obliged, to your great regret, to report to' your Government that you have no hope of being able to settle this question diplomatically and in a friendlv way.” . The First Secretary then went in to the Sultan, and on returning told me that he had found the papers, and the Sultan had instructed him to state that “ the Sultan will do what is required.” . I said that there was no time to lose, as you were leaving to-morrow, but I could get nothing more definite. , . . ^, (Signed) ADAM BLOCK. January 13, 1903.opy. f 34.

My* Lord:- Witti reference to my despatch No.31 of the 19th instant, I have the honour to report that I have received a message from the Grand Vizier to the following effect:- 'The Acting Governor General of the Yemen 'had telegraphed on the 15th instant, that the Otto- 'man Commissioner on the Aden Frontier had reported 'that the British Authorities had moved up two bat talions and six guns to the frontier thus causing 'much excitement among the tribes; that the Commis- 'si oner asked for more troops and two mountain guns 'in order to guard against any eventuality and to al- 'lay any excitement; and further that as the British 'Commission perceived that the proofs adduced in 'support of their claim to disputed territory were 'not valid, it was evident that they intended to use e n .hrquess of lansdowne, K.G., c^C ., c%C ., 'force esC.'force as ao Ad nareja two years ago, and to occupy 'the daces in dispute 'raanu militari’. In these 'circumstances the Ottoman Cornmissioner asked for 'reinforcements and instructions as to the line of 'action to be followed. 'His Highness Farid Pasha had replied to the 'Acting Vali that in view of the repeated assur- 'ances of the British Ambassador that disputed 'points would be reserved for discussion and settle- 'ment between the two Governments, the Ottoman 'Commissioner should use every effort to allay 'the excitement of the tribes and to prevent 'their interference, so as to afford no cause for 'aggression on the part of the British, and the Com- 'missioners were to act with the greatest circum- 'spection and tact, and to conform most strictly 'to the instructions, recently sent to them in ac cordance with the Bultan's Irade'.

At this stage of proceedings Ido not think that negotiations can be broken off, and forcible measures taken; but, if you concur, Mis Majesty's Government will be prepared to instruct British Commissioners as follows : —(1) To require the Turks to evacuate four places in Amiri territory in accordance with the Sultans promises ; by evacuation we mean the removal of all armed men ivho, instigated by the Turks, dispute the authority of the Amir D'thali; (2) To proceed to Lakmat-ash-Shub and invite Turkish Commissioners to join them there and to proceed with the delimitation to the north-east; and, if these two demands are not complied with, to use whatever force may be necessary. } fc J/'fa &amp; l tyd 0 !

As regards the military operations, please remember that it will take a month or more to raise the necessary camels at Aden, that military movements, particularly by British troops, after March will be impossible, and that rationing in summer will be a matter of great difficulty and cost.

Provided that they receive formal recognition by the grant of treaty and stipend, the Upper Yaffai and .Upper Aulaki, who are powerful fighting tribes, would be able to maintain their own frontier against the urks with such assistance as we should in any case have to give them. It may not be necessary to grant them protectorate treaties, but, if the tribes make a point of receiving such treaties, I would tcith all respect deprecate reservations of the nature indicated by the Secretary of Stale in the latter part oj his telegram of §th January. The tribesmen would not understand e reservations, and our reputation for straightforward dealing, which has already been somewhat damaged, would, 1 am afraid, suffer considerably. Examination of the country and determination (?) of the frontier could Jotlow later, though a joint delimitation of it could hardly be expected. f. 0 ^ mouemen t of troops, no orders (?) have as yet been received from India Jor the collection of camels, and the season is already far advanced. As the troops ivould probably have to remain on the plateau throughout the hot weather, it would not be advisable at present to send any considerable jorce to Dthali, but the Dublin Fusiliers, if detained, could be sent and maintained there, together with a wing (?) of the 2Zrd Bombay Infantry. tf ere mould then be a total strength of about 1,500 men on the plateau, -further, I would earnestly represent that a demonstration at Hodeida by two or three British men-of-war, which should be kept there till the Turks shall have complied with all our demands, is advisable.

H.E. appeared anxious for information as to our views upon numerous points of detail but as he admitted to me early in the conversation that he was not 'tres au courant' as to the recent history of the case,I ventured to tell him that I could see no advantage in such a discussion as he was attemp ting. I added that the question had been dealt with through the British Embassybat Constantinople i and that negotiations on parallel lines in London would be inconvenient. I thought it as well however to tell Musurus Pasha ina general way that we had grave reasons for complaining of the manner in which the case had been handled by the Turkish Govt. The controversy had dragged on fox* nearly two years and during that time we had constantly found that the Turkish authorities failed to carry out upon the spot the assurances which the Porte had given to sir N.O’Conoj. at Constantinople. We had now,it seemed to me,arrived at a point when there was nothing more to be done by diplomacy and when we should find ourselves compelled to settlesettle the matter in our own way if the Turkish Govt would not help us to settle it.

The proposal was not sanctioned; hut while the question was under consideration at home, the Resident at Aden had, under instructions from fi-Tu* f British force to support the Chief of Lahej (in the territory of the tbo ni .r 1 ' 10 ) against the Turks, who were giving military assistance to a rebel against . , ,. lle '. 10 1 urkish Government endeavoured to make a bargain that, as they had disclaimed any intention to interfere, the British force should be withdrawn from Lane], this was declined, and it was not until the Turkish troops had evacuated Lahej that the British mrce returned to Aden. The right of the Porte to request the withdrawal of the British troops was at the same time expressly denied by the Secretary of State for India, “since tile relations of the British Government with le tribes round Aden are independent of Turkey, whom we do not admit to have any /octts standi m that region.” J ear ~ 1873 — He1, Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informed tlie 1 orte that Her Majesty’s Government would not tolerate the interference of the Uttoman authorities in the territory of the nine tribes, and this declaration has been repeated several times since. intrigues and interference of the Turkish officials nevertheless continued in u following years, and in 1885 culminated in a more decided forward movement, resulting in the occupation of Jalela, in the heart of the Amiri country, and several other villages belonging to the Amir of Dthali. Her Majesty’s Government protested against this occupation, hut the Turks were m strong force at the time, and nothing more was said than that Her Majesty’s Government could not acquiesce in the indefinite occupation of the Amir’s villages. In the autumn of 1885 the whole subject of our relations with the Aden tribes vas discussed, and certain proposals were made which were referred to the Government of India. These proposals were to the effect that, of the nine tribes, the four nearest to Aden (the Abdali. Subaihi, Akrabi, and Fadhli) should be placed under British protection by Agreements concluded with the Chiefs; that Agreements should be concluded with the Haushabi and Alawi and with the Bower Yaffai, binding them not to sell their territories, or accept the domination of any other Power; that the Upper Yaffai and the Aulaki should be left independent; and that as regards the remaining tribe-—the Amiri—we should quietly desist from our present attitude of opposition to the luiks, allowing the absorption by them of the hamlets on the uplands, and possibly pensioning off the Amir and his immediate successors. r lhe Government of I^^ia in 1886 expressed themselves in favour of these [1804 c—1] B 11 &lt;12 proposals. Since that year, however, the policy of the Government of India has changed, and Protectorate Treaties have been concluded with most of ^ In 1890 Protectorate Treaties were ratified with V r ^ Aulaki, and certain sections of the Suhaihi, and in 1895, with the Abdah, Aausl , Ala ^Co^yTribeI a nlth which we have now no Protectorate Treaty are the Upper Yaffai, the Upper Aulaki, and the Amiri.

T 111 tCfribes receive subsidies, except the Upper Yaffai and Upper Aulaki In 1900 a Turkish subject erected and occupied a fort near Ad Daieja, in the territory of the Haushabi tribe. This incident gave rise to prolonged correspondence with the Porte, and troops were eventually, m duly 1901, sent from Aden to CX P, intruder. Turkish soldiers took part in the defence of the fort, which was evcntu y dCStl in e Au|ist e i901, in view^of the frequent disputes on the frontier of A™.''* territory, the Government of India suggested that it should be de “^Alc y toherTn Anglo-Turkish Commission. They renewed the proposal in the foUowm Octo consequence of Turkish encroachments on the territory of the ^mir °f Uthah and suggested that the demarcation should he based on the map emhodyi.i^ _ . a survey of the frontier districts made by Captain Wahab, E.E., m 1891 92. A telegram was addressed to Sir N. O’Conor on the 12th October, asking for his opinion on the proposal. Shortly afterwards, on the 26th October, he reported that the Sultan had spontaneously expressed a desire for the appointment of a Join ommission define the boundary between Yemen and the tribes by erecting marks. The Sultan’s request for a Joint Commission was communicated by the lurkis Ambassador in London on the 28th October. , , ,, The proposal was accepted in principle by His Majesty s Government, and hot parties proceeded to appoint their Commissioners. „ . . , The Turkish Commissioners met Colonel Wahab, the British Commissioner, at Dthala, the chief village of the Amir of Dthali, on the 11th February ast, and the attitude of the Turks at once made.it evident than an agreement between the Commissioners was out of th^ question. The Turkish Commissioners began by putting forward the Sultan’s claim to the whole of Southern Arabia, and, m particular, claimed the greater part of the Amiri territory m virtue of Imperial Firmans granted hv the Sultan before the British occupation of Aden. Simultaneously with the Turkish proposal for delimitation and its acceptance, the Turks made a forward movement into the country of the Amir of Dthah. I h e y occupied with regular troops the heights of Jebel Jihaf, and subsequently Jebe Mafari, cutting off from Dthali a large portion of the Amir’s territory lying to the west. Regular troops with guns also occupied Jebel Suheb, commanding the camp of the British Commissioners at Dthala. They also occupied with a strong force Jalela (a place If mile from the British camp), which had been occupied by the Turks about twenty years before, and a line of Arab levies was pushed far south into country undoubtedly belonging of right to the Amiri tribes, and constantly in the undisputed possession of the Amir. _ ^ ^ i i ji Later the Turks forciblv seized the Amir’s village of Lakmat-es-baieb, north- r At the same time the Turks took steps to make it impossible for the British Commissioners to move about in the disputed territory. Their icgnlar troops and Arab levies had orders to prevent any British party from visiting the Amir’s country to the west or north, and persons attached to the British Commission were actually fired at on several occasions. In spite of the protests of His Majesty’s Government against these proceedings, and their repeated requests to the Turkish Government to furnish their Commis sioners with instructions which would make an understanding possible, the efforts made by the British Commissioner to come to some agreement with his Turkish colleagues in regard to the Dthali boundary led to no result, and on the 27th June the India Office suggested that the British Commissioner should be directed to proceed with the work of delimitation to the east of the Amiri plateau, the question of the boundary of the Amiri country being reserved. Lord Lansdowne concurred, and instructions were sent to Colonel Wahah on the 19th July to invite the Turkish Commissioners to proceed with the delimitation east of the Amiri plateau up to the desert or other boundary of the rest of the Protecto rate. If they refused he was to carry out the work by himself.3 d’Affaires at Constantinople infornTd the°Porto ^ ansdowne ’ H i s Majesty’s Charge His Majesty’s Government mm’nfm'nn i +i ltc ^ these instructions, and stated that ^ a § ain st the encroachments of the Tu’-]dV le fi Pr0t f- StS - Wllicl1 they liad alread J mad e On the 22nd J ulv the !e u f ls \^ordies m the Dthali country, he had acquainted the Minister for War oT^tf ^ Affairs info ™ ed Mr. de Bunsen that him to send the necessary instructions in ei nee comraumca t 10 n, and had requested On the Wih lus tiuctions to the Ottoman Commission.

Mr. de Bunsen was then to call attention to the occupation of_ Jebels Suheb, Jabaf, and Mafari, the seizure of Bakmat-es-Saleh, and the establishment of the line of Arab levies, and to state that His Majesty’s Government must altogether dissent from the view that the territory thus occupied was by right Turkish. Further, that they had never admitted that Jalela, which had for some years been occupied by a Turkish force, and some adjoining villages which appeared to recognize Turkish jurisdiction, were by riHit Turkish: that His Majesty’s Government had not thought it necessary to claim the evacuation of these places as a condition precedent to the meeting of the Commission which was, in their view, intended, in the first instance, to ascertain and define the state of affairs existing at the time of its appointment ; that they must, however, formally protest against the acts of occupation which had taken place durino- the recent discussions, and that they thought it necessary to demand, before the work of the Commission proceeded further on that part of the frontier, that the Turkish regular troops and irregular levies should be withdrawn from all places thus recently occupied; that His Majesty’s Government must insist on categorical orders to the above effect being sent and effectively carried out.

Tnrbkh Com At an interview with Colonel Wahab, on the ^9tb September, the luihish Com missioners informed him that they had received no orders, but promised to apply for them to the Yemen authorities. They gave Colonel Wahab their hs p f .f 1 '® “‘Ae 0 “ which the Yaffai and Aulaki were replaced by two other names, believed to be those ot snb-sections of the Haushabi tribe. • c .11 rp On the 5th October Colonel Waliab reported that there was no sign of ^e 1 u vs withdrawing from the places they had recently occupied, and that, tl ie contiai), they were intriguing with certain Sheikhs with a view to the occupation of Jabal Anas, SOUth On?he°mh October Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to Sir N.

It was, lie said, his sacred duty not to ojve up territory to which he believed himself to he entitled, and on the other hand, he was anxious^ keep on good terms with England. He appealed to the friendship and O’Conof rfp^e^ntedCiatHis Majesty’s Government could not tolerate that territorv which they believed to belong to Chiefs protected by them should be occupied hv Turkish troops. ‘ Unless His Majesty’s Government could count on His Majesty to settle the difficultv in a friendly manner, a regrettable conflict would almost mevitah y ensue After considerable discussion, the Sultan finally assured Sir H. O Conor tha he was giving serious attention to the question, that it would be considered by the Council of Ministers, and that an early answer would be given. „ „ ^, Sir N O’Conor subsequently ascertained that the report of the Council of Ministers was to the effect that, as in 1873 the nine tribes had been recognized by the Ottoman Government as under British protection, and as an Imperial trade had recently authorized the Government to propose the delimitation of the frontier between Yeme and the tribes, it was advisable to proceed in accordance with thexe decisions. After some negotiations between SirN. O’Conor and the Porte m regard to t e terms of the communication to be addressed to him, he accepted a note dated the 1st November, stating that the Imperial Government had decided that Jebel Jihal, \ r-wf at ' eS ' S ^ leh J nd Sulleb sllould be evacuated at once by the Imperial miSi st on,rr tl0U ? f * heb ; 0 '™ ersbi P ^ed for discussion, and that tTde say. toZds the desert ^ “ St PlaCe ’ “ a Dortb - e 4 e ^ direction-that is to P la f“ r ecently occupied by the Turks have been evacuated by the t^the BrifiT Pn U ^ are hy armed Arabs - wbo Prevent anyone belonging cordon of ArabT mlSS10n ’.f to tbe Amir of from approaching.

L . . Slr ^ T ; C&gt; ’ Con ? r Passed the Porte to send instructions to the Turkish Com- missioners to go with the British Commission to Lakmat-es-Shub, the proposed starting- poiin toi the delimitation, and he was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ILth December, that instructions in this sense had been sent. tlle same (Ia y Colonel Wahah telegraphed that the Turkish Commissioners still refused to recognize the Yaffai as one of the nine tribes, and that, in these circum stances, the delimitation could not be proceeded with. . P n t]ie December Colonel Wahab telegraphed that the Turkish Com missioners had declared on the previous day that they had not received orders to proceed to Lakmat-es-Shub. Finally, on the 15th December, Colonel Wahab telegraphed that the Turkish Commissioners declined to comply with his specific demands (made in accordance with instructions from His Majesty’s Grovernment) that they would join him in demarcating the frontier to the north-east, alleging orders from Constantinopie to include the Yaffai in Turkish tenitory. Thej/ admitted that they had received orders not to demarcate or to proceed north-east, and instead of starting from Lakmat-es-Shub in the north-east corner of the Amiri country, to start from Dimna in the south-east, thence eastward to the Dana Elver, thence down its course to the Bakhtizar border, and thence to the sea, thus leaving the whole of the Yaffai and Aulaki territory on the Turkish side of the frontier. A Beport has just been received from the British Commission on the whole situation in the Amiri country, accompanied by a map showing the boundaries claimed on either side. Mr. G. Fitzmaurice, Third Dragoman to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constanti nople, who, at Sir N. O’Conor’s suggestion, has recently joined Colonel Wahab in the capacity of a Commissioner, holds strongly the opinion that it is necessary, for the settlement of the question, that we should insist on the withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from Jalela, and support the Amir of Dthali in reacquiring possession of the whole of the territory under his rule in 1872; and, further, that we should draw the line of frontier so as to include the whole of the Upper Yaffai tribe in the British Protectorate, making Protectorate Treaties both with the Amiri and Upper Yaffai. In the meanwhile, in view of the threatening attitude of the Turkish forces and of the imputation under their influence m the neighbourhood of the Commission, a battalion has been sent from India and reinforced the garrison at Aden, and a force of 400 infantry with four guns is being dispatched to Dthali to reinforce the British escort of the Commission. This force will arrive on the 10th January. A battery of mountain guns has also been applied for, and is being sent from India. The Turks have a force of 400 to 500 men, with one field gun and three mountain guns at Jalela. Negotiations are being entered into by Colonel Wahab with the Chiefs of the Upper Yaffai in order to obtain their consent to the Commission marching through their territory, and the Eesident at Aden has suggested that they should be assured that His Majesty’s Government recognize them as one of the nine tribes, and will not permit any occupation of their territory by Turkey. Sir N. O’Conor considers that, as the Turks have admitted the Yaffai to be one of the nine tribes, they could not consistently object to our concluding a Protectorate Treaty with them. The most recent telegram from the President at Aden (the 3rd December) asks for authority to deal summarily with any obstructions on the part of the Turks, and the India Office have suggested (the 2nd January) the following course of action—that Sir N. O’Conor should be directed to press for instructions being sent forthwith to the Turkish Commissioners to meet the British Commissioners at Lakmat-es-Shub, and proceed thence to demarcate the northern boundaries of the Upper Yaffai country;that lie should inform the Porte at the same time that if these instructions are not obeyed by the Turkish Commissioners, the British Commission will proceed to ascertain these boundaries—the British escort being instructed to deal summarily with any attempt to interfere with the lines of communication of the British Commission and to repel by force any movement which the Turks may make tending to a reoccupation of any of the posts from which they have withdrawn, or to the establis ment of fresh posts within the disputed limits. , P , ,, If this course is approved, steps will he taken to have a sufficient foice at the disposal of the Besident to carry out the measures proposed.

O’Conor, on liis return to Constantinople, took an early opportunity of distinctly claiming the Yaffai rs one of the nine tribes ; and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted the claim (Sir N. O Conors No. 411, dated 18th September 1902). a , 2838/02. On the 1st November the Turkish Government, with the Sultan s per mission. solemnly accepted delimitation “vers le ^ord-est, cest a dire, vers le desert ” and in his telegram No. 131 of the 18th November, summing up the situation, Sir N. O’Conor says “ It has been agreed with the Turkish “ Government to begin at once delimitating north-eastwards to^ the desert; Yaffai is thus necessarily placed among the nine tribes. . . 1 he question, “ moreover, was decided in our favour when raised some time ago. It appears, then, that (1) the Indian Government have from the first regarded the Yaffai, without distinction of Upper and Lower, as one of the nine tribes to which Lord Granville’s warning of 1873 applied; (2) that by the Foreign Office letter of the 25th August His Majesty’s Government accepted the view of the India Office that for the purposes of the delimitation the Upper Yaffai cannot be separated from the Lower Yaffai and are included in the nine tribes to which the warning of 1873 applied ; (3) that the Turkish Government by agreeing to delimitation in a north-east direction towards the desert have ipso facto accepted this view. Yet the local Turkish Commissioners have up to the present refused to recognise the Yaffai as one of the nine cantons; and the British Commissioners have been unable to take any steps to carry out their instructions. The position named Lakhmat-ash-fehub has been selected by Colonel Wahab as a suitable starting point, but before the Commission can proceed thither they must have some assurance of the safety of their communications. Further more, in a telegram of the 16th December, the Resident reported that Colonel Wahab considered that without the goodwill of the Yaffai, it would bo impossible for the Commission to go through their country, and advised that they should receive a subsidy. On the 19th the Secretary of State- suggested as an alternative an immediate payment for allowing tho Commission to enter their country, but adhered to his decision of the 5th September not to sanction a protectorate for the present. After further consultation with Aden the sum of Rs. 10,000 was sanctioned as the amount of the payment; but a further suggestion was made by the Resident (29th December) that the Yaffai should be assured that they are recognised by Government as one of the nine tribes, and that no occupation by the Turks of country proved to be Yaffai will be permitted. While this proposal was still under consideration the Resident reported (4th January) that the Yaffai Chiefs (with one exception), had accepted an invitation to come in to Dthali in a week or 10 days. He thought that they might possibly refuse a cash payment and hold out for a stipend and pro tectorate treaty. He strongly urged that he might be authorised to concede both their conditions, the latter being understood only to cover aggression by foreigners. Failing approval of the latter condition, he suggested that he should be allowed .to offer a stipend and treaty of friendship and peace. Sir N. O’Conor having meanwhile (telegram of 26 th December 1C02, No. 144) reported that he saw no objection, from the point of view of our engagements with the Turks, to a protectorate, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was necessary to conciliate the Yaffai, but undesirable to commit ourselves further than was necessary with that object. The Secretary of State therefore telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 9th January as follows :— See Aden telegrams, 29th December and Uh January, on the subject of the Tipper Yaffai. The Prime Minister and Lord Lansdowne agree as to the necessity of our securing the friendship of the Upper Yaffai Sheikhs, but until the facts concerning the limits of tribal territory have been ascertained by our Commission, they are unwilling that ice should be committed further than is necessary. It is, therefore, desirable that Besident should attempt to gain support of Sheikhs by offer of money payments, if necessary increasing the limit of Bs. 10,000 mentioned in Besident's above-quoted telegram of Pol. 1 of 1903 .December, and that, if this offer fn'ii* a i&gt; u • suggestion, propose to conclude Sit/thL a treaty combined with a stipend In mem nf tb* r '.J! friendship and peace, ^ of to-day’s date, mlougUITblluUtenf 'frft ^ ° ther promised, if found absolutely necessary But be being found necessary it must hr i * U ev€nt °f Mis promise commit us to maintain the actual limits gUar( ^ e ^ te rms that it does not should be found advisable to adootZl f ° CC ^ ahon h V Me tribes, if it investigations of the Commission. 6 compr()mise &gt; as Me result of the II-- Military Arrangements. a few sappers and miners and Aden troop. 1 ^ mtantiy, and pa^w^^nterferinVwkh 1 ’^ 6851 ' 6114 r ' P0, ' tf 1 ^ armed P arties “ T ^h nXfintr y dtLathe “ “gSed the escorfb; a Ta?/company* of m. ru “ ou , rs ’ but h ® f ked . some British troops and two mountam guns t J*f\ den f 1 ' 01 0S( ' d to ut,l,s&lt; : 1hls opportunity of testing the suitability of the Dthah plateau as a sanatorium by sending up 40 British infantrvand 25 gunners with two guns.

On the 12th of May the Resident was again authorised to strengthen the Commission by any troops necessary for its salety and support within the line we claimed. 1 On the 14th May the Resident lepoitcd that the Tuiks had made large encroachments recently, and he doubted whether they could be induced to evacuate without a display of force on our side. The Secretary of State merely repeated his previous instructions. J mu V h ? t 18 * JU “ e i t ' le E c e !L de m re P orted that th e Turkish force on the Dthah plateau, exclusive of the Turkish Commissioners’ escort, amounted to 800 men with eight guns The Resident pointed out that no troops could now be moved up from Aden for some weeks at least. ,, thi.the 10th October the Resident reported a suggestion by Colonel Wahab T\!rr;,° the strong pressure being exerted by the Turks on tribes winch he held to be subsidiary to the Amir of Dthali, troops should be sent up. ihe Resident suggested that it might he expedient to undertake preliminary measures by warning some troops in India for service and by authorising equipment to be provided at Aden for a column of 600 men The Viceroy, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, was instructed to take the necessary measures, if he agreed. His agreement was conveyed in a telegram of the 16th October. „ ? n , th ® l°J h , Kovelrib, -' r the Resident reported a recommendation by Colonel Wahab that, when the movement of the Commission to the North- East took place, a column of 400 men, of whom some should he British, should he stationed at Dthali. This proposal was supported by the Viceroy (24th November). On the 2nd December the Secretary of State authorised the Besident’s proposal being carried out, and the despatch from India to Aden if necessary, of a battalion of native infantry for reinforcement, hut no movement ot troops from Aden was to take place without further instructions. On the 9th December the Resident reported that he doubted whether a reinforcement by one battalion from India would he sufficient, should a display of force be an object distinct from the occupation of Dtliali. He thought that at least half a battalion of British infantrv, and a native mountain battery should he sent in addition. S. 4. A 24' ■ ft* On the 11th December, the necessary explanations having been given at Constantinople, the Viceroy was instructed to order the Resident to send to Dthali 400 additional troops with four guns, as soon after Mr. Fitzmaunce s arrival as he might think expedient; but in the meantime to take do further steps. This force left Aden 2nd January and was due at Dthali on the 10th. On the 2nd January the despatch of a native mountain battery from India was authoiised, the Aden guns on wheels being reported useless owing to the nature of the country. _ . . , , On the 6th January a report from Mr. Ditzmaunce was received, showing the precarious position in which the communications of the British Commission with the South would be placed, when it proceeded to the North-East, by the occupation by the Turks of Jalela with trcops and of other positions with native levies, owing to the hostile attitude assumed by the Turks. His Maiestv’s Government accordingly resolved to send further instructions to the Government of India. The Secretary of State accordingly telegraphed Viceroy on the 9th January as follows S66 Aden telegram of 31st December. The Dorte has again been pressed by the British Ambassador at Constantinople to send immediate . instructions to their Commissioners to meet the British Commission forthwith a t LaTchmat-ash-shub, and to proceed with the demarcation of the boundaries „ 0 f the Upper Yaffai from that point towards the desert. When the proper moment arrives. O'Conor will be instructed to inform the Forte that if instructions to the above effect are not sent, and are not obeyed by the Turkish Commission, the British Commission will proceed by itself to ascertain the boundaries in question, and that any attempt to interfere with their line of communication will be summarily dealt with ; that, moreover, force will be used to expel Turkish troops or Arab levies from Amiri territory, if any attempt is made by the Turks to re-occupy vacated posts or establish fresh ones in the disputed Amiri territory, or if the Turks or their Arab levies molest the British troops in any way. Please let me know on what date British Commission will be ready to start for Lakhmat-ash-shub and to commence delimitation, if necessary, by itself and in spite of opposition by Turks; also, whether our troops at Dthali are of sufficient strength with reinforcements available from Aden to carry out quickly and effectively the expulsion of Turks from the Amiri territory. This telegram was repeated to the Resident on the 9th January, who replied on the 11th January as follows to the question about the sufficiency of the troops on the spot: — With reference to your enquiry of the §th January, the troops at Dthali are of insufficient strength to carry out quickly and effectively the ejectment J of Turks from Amiri territory. The Aden garrison is already under strength, and no re-inf or cements could be sent from there. To effect desired object, and to keep open communications, a brigade is necessary, including British infantry and British mountain batteries from India. A very con siderable force, in addition to the brigade above mentioned, would be necessary if our Commission were to attempt to enter Yaffai territory without the consent of the tribe. Such a contingency woidd lead to very serious complications, and is to be strongly deprecated. And on the 14th January the Resident sent further information as^ follows :— Our column is reported by Wahab to have arrived at Dthali f): In anticipation of its arrival the Turks have reinforced their Jalela and Kataba garrisons, increasing the former to 500 men ivith six guns, and the latter to 340 men with two guns. Consequently they now hate near Dthali a force considerably superior to ours, especially in guns, as we have only four obsolete 7-pounders against their eight modern breech-loading guns. Wahab draws special attention to the increase of the Turkish forces at Jalela, in territory which is not admitted to be Turkish, the garrison being now largely in excess of what can be considered necessary for the Com missioner's escort. He further reports that 600 Arab levies are being raised by the Turks to hold Jabot Mafare and Jabal Jehaf, from all ivhich (.Gey their regular troops had been withdrawn. n. 1tta nib. iJi M,|Sp'SL°Mw, 1 “tS tS,'« »t - ~ w“rsr„ preparation for their despatch mavberentftZZTf, Whal ™er immediate of my sanction.

JEe do not regard situation as (?) permanentlu ameliorated by the issue of the recent Irade, as in the past Turkish assurances have so often been deceptive. At present juncture we wish to submit to Bis Majesty s Government an urgent representation of the views which we have expressed on the mam question. Dor more than a year, by procrastination and subterjuge, the Turkish Government have encroached on the amiability of the British Government; while the Turks on the spot have acted as if completely independent of their Government, ignoring whatever assurances the Sultan has given, inventing frivolous charges against the British Com missioners, insulting and firing upon the British party, the culminatinq incident being the stabbing of a British officer—and doing all in their power to prejudge the question and to diminish British prestige ivit.h the local tribes When the Commission proceeds to Lakmat ash-Shub to demarcate the boundary north-eastwards, the tactics already described will probably only be transferred to another locality, and meanwhile the problem of B'thali will remain unsolved, ^understand the view of His Majesty’s Government to be first, that Turkish levies and troops should be ivithdrawn from the four ports of Jebel Gihaf, Mafare, Lakmat-ab-Salah, and Jebel Shabad; but, secondly, that Jalela, Lakmat-al-Hajfar, Jalas, and JVabh should be allowed toremain in military occupation of the Turks; and, thirdly, that the 4 discussion of the Amiri boundary shoidd be deferred to some future date and settled in London or Constantinople. As to this policy we desire to represent that it involves immediate danger, since it will leave in Turkish hands the communications of our party on the North- Last boundary, and that there is no likelihood of its ever leading to a peaceful settlement of the Amiri question. The discussion will be spun out for years, during which we shall be keeping our troops on the spot at great expense, and the perpetual strain ivill be sapping the loyalty of the Amir of Lthali and of the local tribes. We urge His Majesty s Government to realise that the matter can not be disposed of by half measures. Every representation we have hitherto made has been endorsed by Mr. Fitzmaurice's report; and our strong recommendation is that we should use the present opportunity to settle the main question and not merely minor and petty issues. There will be no peace on Dthali border whilst the Turkish occupation continues south of KdThba. The blue line on Wahab's map of 2nd December is supported by powerful arguments and strongly advocated by Mr. Fitzmaurice; and it seems to us that we are noiv justified by the persistent bad faith of the Turkish Government in demanding its acceptance as the frontier. We think, moreover, that the conduct of the Turks on the spot has been so intolerable dursng the past year that serious reparation is due to us. As the Forte is quite aware, it will be impossible in a few months time for troops to move in the disputed territory. If definite measures are not taken, controversy ivill only be put off till next cold weather, and two years will have been wholly- wasted. Whatever decision may be eventually arrived at as to the apportion ment of the expense of the delimitation proceedings, it seems to us to be inequitable that a continuance of tactics of delay should involve the Indian taxpayer in a risk of further burdens. We think that it would be wise, should His Majesty s Government agree with our views, to despatch at once from India two battalions of Native infantry and a second mountain battery, and to retain for the present at Aden the Dublin regiment, which is due tb&gt; leave next month. To supplement this show of force, or as a substitute for it, a naval demonstration at Hodeida might be made. We emphatically urge that the political pivot of the whole question is the Dthali plateau, and that any settlement which leaves itfffiutiire in protracted, doubt will be valueless.

Sir 5 t ti \ -«T-j 7 i ,, t Aden Residency, December 6, 1902. 1 WAV L the honour to forward a copy of a Secret letter, dated the 2nd instant, trom Colonel Yahab, m charge of the Aden Boundary Commission, addressed to the secretary to Government of India in the Foreign Department, which which he submits a map showing the lines proposed by the British and Turkish Commissioners respec- tively, and a Memorandum on the Amiri frontier. 2. -The Memorandum has been prepared in consultation with me, and it will. I think, be found to present the whole case in a clear and complete manner. I have asked o one! AYahab to forward translations of the documents mentioned in paragraph 1, and also, if possible, photographs of the more important papers, in case His Majesty’s Government may desire to examine them closely. Translations of four of the documents were forwarded with Colonel Wahab's despatch, dated the 28th February, 1902. 3. I venture to think that the documents, as a whole, with the information and explanations now afforded, fully justify the views of the British Commission as to the extent of the territory under the Amir of Dthali, and support his claim to the boundary which they have indicated. The exaggerated counter-claims of the Turkish officials have hardly any evidence to sustain them, and they appear to be almost entirely disposed of by the criticisms of the British Commissioners. 4i. I do not, however, quite agree with Colonel Wahab in rejecting all documents on either side prior to a.d. 1630 (a.h. 1039), the year in which the ancient rule of the Ottoman Turks in Yemen ceased to exist. The present question is not whether the Amir of Dthali is or is not a Chief under British protection. Notwithstanding the pretensions of the Sultan to suzerainty over the whole of Arabia, it has not been denied by the Porte that the Amir’s country is one of the nine Chiefships or districts under British influence. The actual difference is as to the extent of the Amir’s territories. Now, according to the Turkish view, the period of 242 years from the withdrawal of the Turks in 1630 to the reassertion of Ottoman authority in .1872 was a mere intermission, in which the Sultan’s rule was dormant but not extinguished ; and the Turkish Commis sioners will only admit as evidence Firmans or other documents emanating from the Imperial Government at Constantinople. The ancient Turkish Firmans in the possession of the British Commissioners seem to me, therefore, to have a distinct value; and it is noticeable that against two out of the three the Turks have nothing to say. These Firmans confirm former Amirs in the possession of territories stated to extend from the stream of Kataba on the north to that of A1 Mileh on tbe south, and from the Wadi Bana on the east to the Wadi Tiban on the west, and show that the extent of the [1804 «—4] BAmir’s country in former times, as acknowledged by the Sultans ot 1 urkey themselves, was not less than that now claimed by the British Commission. 5. Since the withdrawal of the Turks from Yemen in 1630, the evidence _ of continuity of possession of their territories by the Amirs of Dthali appears to be tairly complete'; and this continuity is shown to have practically existed, with the exception ot the comparatively brief interregnum caused by the Turkish aggression ot W3-7o, up to the time when demarcation was proposed by the Porte last year. 6. With regard to the Turkish documentary evidence, they have nothing ot importance to set against the array of convincing statements on the other side. I think the only point that need be mentioned here is the claim to the districts^ ot Azraki, Mehrabi, &amp;c., based on a so-called admission by the late Amir of Dthali, Ali-bin-Mukhbil, that these places were not in his territory. The words relied on occur in a statement made by the Amir complaining of certain aggressions committed by the Turks, and I explained in my letter, dated the 11th March last, that these words were, as is evident from the context, an interpolation by the writer, Muhammed Saieh Jatf'er, the then native assistant to the Resident. There is good reason to believe that this man, who was afterwards dismissed for malpractices, was in the Turkish interest; and it is not improbable that he purposely intercalated the words in question. It w T as his practice to introduce explanatory remarks into the body of his translations, and, in the impeifect state of knowledge of the country which then (and long afterwards) existed, the inter polation attracted no attention. The introduction of explanatory remarks by the trans lators of Arabic papers has continued till very lately. It was still the custom when I arrived in Aden in June 1901. . v . With regard to the interpolation itself— u tribes not belonging to the Amir —it may be observed that Muhammed Saleh Jaffer said that the tribes in question did not belong to the Amir. He did not assert that they belonged to the Turks, and it is possible that he only meant that they were independent, this having been the case for a certain time at that period, owing to the disorganization caused by the Turkish aggressions. , . . 7. The actual line of frontier proposed by the British Commission will, I hope, be accepted. It is the boundary of the tribes and districts who acknowledge the Amir, and, though it is unfortunate that the British Commission have been prevented from visiting all the localities, tribal limits are, os a rule, well known. It is only with regard to the Dakkam that there is any doubt whether they should be included on the Amir’s side of the boundary. The British Commissioners are, I think, right, in the circumstances of the case, in claiming the tribe. It is necessary, however, to point out toat theie is a discrepancy between the Memorandum and the map in the case of these people. They are described as living on both sides of the Tiban \alley above the Ahmadi and Humedi, but the map would seem to indicate that they are altogether on the eastern side, and that the Tiban itself is the boundary. The Memorandum is, I believe, the more correct, and if this tribe is to be included in the Amir’s dominions, the boundary will be at some distance beyond the stream. The Tiban would not, in my opinion, be a satis factory line of demarcation. In hilly countries, and all regions where water is not very abundant, tribes live along the glens or stream hollows, and a stieam, unless of the largest size, is hardly ever a division between clan and clan. It more often runs through the centre of the tribal settlements. Whatever decision may eventually be arrived^at, I would deprecate the division of this or any other tribe as facili tating intrigue and unrest in the future, and probably giving rise to very undesirable complications. 8. I venture to hope that His Majesty’s Government will be able to decide, on the evidence now T submitted, where the boundary of the Amir a teintoiiea, and, theiefoie, of the Turkish possessions/should be traced. It does not appear that anything in the shape of a mutual agreement between the British and Turkish Commissioners is possible, much less that a joint demarcation can ever be carried out. In fact, the Turkish officers do not appear to have powers sufficient to edect a delimitation, and their instructions would seem to be to make impossible demands, and to lower their British colleagues in the sight of the Arabs in every way practicable. I would respectfully submit that, in these circumstances, and in view of the great forbearance which has been displayed towards the Turks without producing any satisfactory result, His Majesty’s Government, having decided where the Amir’s boundary rightfully lies, should inform both the Ottoman Government and the Amir of Dthali of their decision, adding that the latter will be supported in resuming possession of his territories by the presence of a British force. I trust that if action in this direction should be taken, it will be stated very clearly that, the time for negotiation and discussion having passed, His Majesty’s Governmentrequire the complete evacuation by the Turks of nil ^ a • &gt; ,. -x including Jalela. ^ 1 k 1 1 1 rts of tbe Amirs territory, of the' Turks '^ean' now j Dal&lt; H a '? trib «&gt; n ° examination of their country with the aid finally including the tribes in the A° r ' ’ q erbap ?’ ll0 ' v e v er, it would be possible, without Turks tu til i g tnbes in the Amir s dominions, to decline to admit anv riffht of the Jndt he 1: d P :rTuXsh the withdra ' ai of Turffgarrison Amir l imits of tLnmr ^ ® l™' 1 th ® count O’ 'vhieh undoubtedly belongs to the A n admits ot further and complete investigation by our officers. evacuate thnkhairconl t tr! ed T h h at f ° rl i e 1 thil ' k '' m b . e necessary to oblige the Turks to troons that should ho f * X r ^ ® o as ^ e d permission to purchase camels for the t A • ,1 ^ ^ ^ T nt . ^ rom ^ n( iia.

Colonel Vi ahab s Report and diaries show that the situation on the plateau is one ot serious tension, and it is impossible to contemplate, without grave anxiety, the possibility ot a sudden rupture at a season when the great heat and scarcity of water on the roads would render it hardly possible to move even a comparatively small body of troops. # J I have, &amp;c.

Colonel Wahab to Government of India. ®i T &gt; . ^ Camp Dthala, December 2, 1902. 1 HAVE the honour to forward a Memorandum on the Amiri frontier, together with two copies of a map showing the lines proposed by the British and Turkish Commissioners respectively, and to request that you will be good enough to forward it, with the map signed by the Commissioners, to the Secretary of State for India. An identical map has been sent by the Turkish Commissioners to their own Government. 2. The original documents which have been produced bv the Amir of Dthala in support of his claim, and of which an abstract is given in Appendix I of the Memorandum are still in my possession. They have all been examined by the Turkish Commissioners who were given every facility for copying such as they thought essential; I do not^ therefore, think it necessary to send them with the Memorandum, especially as manv of them are old and fragile. If required, I can submit literal translations of them which were made under Lieutenant-Colonel Abud’s supervision; he is now on leave in England and would certify to their accuracy if called upon. 3. The boundary-lines claimed by the two parties, respectively, differ, it will be seen, very widely. The Turks, in preferring their claim, evidently acted on the principle of asking for a great deal in the hope of, at any rate, receiving a little. Their claims, as shown by their own statements, rest on no stronger basis than the presumption of the Sultan’s sovereignty over all Arabia—a claim never admitted by His Majesty’s Government. The British Commissioners, on the other hand, have limited their claims to the actual posses sions of the Amir in 1872, when Turkish encroachment began, and which, with the excep tion of Jalela and the adjoining villages, represents, as nearly as possible, the actual status in 1901, when delimitation was agreed upon. 4. I would venture to urge the importance of early settlement of this question. The Commission can hardly be withdrawn until it is settled without leaving an impression on the Arabs that we are unable to support them against Turkish aggression. The Sultan’s Government is very unlikely to yield to any demands that are not supported by force ; but the season for military operations is short, and unless effective action is taken within the next two or three months, nothing will be accomplished till another year. At the same time I am convinced that the obstructive attitude of the Turksis due to our military weakness in adequate force were on the spot.

THE territory of the Amir of Dthala lies nearly north of Aden, from which place its southern boundary is about 60 miles distant. It forms roughly speaking, the first step in the ascent from the coast plain of Southern Arabia to_ the highlands of \ emen. The valley in which Dthala, the principal town, is situated is an open, well-cultivated plain nearly 5,000 feet above sea-level, extending some 10 miles from north to south, and on an average 3 miles in width. West of Dthala the plain is bounded by the steep slopes of Jabal Jihaf, rising to over 7,500 feet, and on the east numerous latera valleys the intervening ridges studded with the towers of Shain villages, lead up to the hi^h tormed ransres of the Shabi country and Harir. ^ . . From Jabal Jihaf several rugged spurs extend west to the Wadi Tiban a perenma stream rising in the highlands far to the north-west, and on the south the Mashwara range, and the remarkable plateau of Addthubiyat fall away abruptly to the plains The whole country forms a welcome contrast to the arid surroundings of Aden , e c ima e 18 c and equable, and the regular summer rains permit excellent crops of jowan and bajra to le raised. All the cultivable ground in the valleys and on the gentler slopes is carefully terraced, and irrigated by channels skilfully laid out, so as to utilize the hill torrents to the utmost, and the numerous stone-built villages, with their towers picturesque y situated on the hill-tops overlooking the cultivated valleys, show the existence of a settled and-industrious population. . j f i, ‘2. The inhabitants consist of several tribes, which, though semi-independent all acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy, and in most eases pay him an annual tribute. The Amir has a voice in the election ot the various Sheikhs; all important matters affecting the tribes are referred to him, and his influence and authority are constantly exercised • * • - 3 The Amir’s relatives and dependents, who may be described as the A-nnri proper, occupy the Dthala Valley, the Zubed district extending 3 miles south of Dthala, Al Hamra, or Tafwa, and the neighbouring villages m the Selat Haidaba, Jahal Harir, and Al Kharafa, a group of villages lying in the Selat Dthanab to the south 0&lt; H 4 n The principal place is Ad Dthala, where the Amir resides, with about 1,200 inhabitants, and a weekly market, at which a very large business is done; on occasion the numbers coining in were counted at 2,830 men, with 36- camels and 3- donvets.^e va p ev j s dotted with Amiri villages, about forty in all, among which may be mentioned Dthi Hiran, Al W’ara, Haiaz, Al Khobar Al Husen, Lakmat ash Sh’ub, and-the Habil as Sul;, the last-named south-west, and withm a short distance of Kataba. Jabal Harir. 6 Jabal Harir, which is now claimed by the Turks, is a high plateau over 7,000 feet above sea-level, with a large number of villages and towers. It has never been occupied bv the Turks, nor has Turkish authority been exercised there in any form. It is occupied by the Amir’s own retainers, and seems to have always been in close relations with Dthala as an integral part of the Amir’s territory. Jabal Harir was visited by two officers of the British Commission in February 1902 under arrangements made by the Annr; the party stayed there three days, and heard nothing to raise any suspicion that the Amirs lights o possession could be questioned. Only last month the Amir’s son (acting in his fathers absence) went himself, as a matter of duty, to the aid of the people when they were threatened by enemies.Other Tribes subject to the Amir. tribes on the east and^be^nnku 0 ^ lt ' J ^ m ii'are the Shairi, the Halmin, and the Aj’ud on the west Tl ’these Humedi&gt; Ahmadi &gt; Mafari - Mihrabi &gt; and ^ the Turks, 6 together with Z a tr ;, beSs 38 weI1 as the Shairi . are b y Harir. ° ‘ he Amln V,lla ' es ln the r) thala Valley north of Jalela and Jabal The green'hlie'shows tZ ?? a “ om P an y in f ma P shows the extent of the Turkish claims, and wHeh accord^ to T,,?’ 7 t0 7 hlCh the .

In the Dthala Valley itself the Amir was in 1901 in possession of all Amiri vi up to Lakrrtat-ash-Sh ub and the Habil-as-Snk, in the immediate neighbourhood o ataba. Mis accounts show that he has been in receipt of the revenues from all his lands north of Jalela and in the Wadi Safiya, and, though the Turks held the Shairi Milages 01 Jalela, Lakmat-al-Hajfar, Jalas, and Wab’h with a small garrison of 40 men, tney do not appear to have interfered with the Amir in the administration of the rest of the country in any way. It is only since the military occupation in strength made by the iuiks last yeai, evidently to anticipate the settlement of the frontier by this Commission, that the Amii has been unable to freely exercise his rule in the northern part of his teirhories. He has, however, continued to exercise it so far as, in view of avoiding trouble, it has been thought advisable to permit him. Shairi. 12. The Shairi tribe number about 3,000, with twenty-six villages. They occupy the side valleys opening into the Dthala Valley on the east,*and the head of the Hardaba Valley. Their principal villages are Ai Khureba and Ad Dimnah in the Hardaba Valley, and Jalela, Aul Sabula, Al Alalaha, and Al Kariya, on the plateau. The Shairi are /intimately connecteo with the Amir, the main road from Aden to Kataba, and San’a by the Khuieba Pass is in their territory, and the Amir has always been held responsible for the safety of this road and for the general behaviour of the Shairi tribe. One small section to which the inhabitants of Jelela, Lakmat-al-Hajfar, Jalas, and Wab’h belong, has been compelled to submit to Turkish occupation since the establishment of the Turkish post at Jalela in 1885, but the remainder of the tribe, the principal Sheikhs of which have from time to time visited the British Commission, emphatically assert their dependence on the Amir, and deny having at any time submitted to the Turks. References by the Shairi of disputes to the Amir’s judgment have continued during the present year, and show that his jurisdiction is admitted by the Shairi as a matter of course. The only evidence produced by the Turks in support of their claim consists of ancient Firmans prior to 1630 a.d., appointing a Sheikh of the Shairi tribe, and certain receipts for taxes alleged to have been paid during the years 1883 to 1889 a.d. These, however, even if genuine, only represent taxes paid by the small portion of the tribe occupying Jalela and the adjoining villages under Sheikh Muthana, whose appointment by the Turks to the Chiefship was never accepted by the tribe. This is more fully explained in the statement by his son Saleh Muthanna in Appendix 3. [1804 a—4] C6 Jabal Jihaf. ]3. The huge mountain mass of Jabal Jihaf, which rises precipitously to the west of the Dthala Plain, has about sixty villages scattered about its crags and slopes. The Ahl Jihaf, as the people are called, are divided into about thirty clans, one of which is the Zendani. As regards the Turkish claim to Jabal Jihaf, this again is solely based on inter vention since 1872. The following is a brief history of that intervention : Turkish troops visited Jihaf at the time of the Turkish invasion of Dthala, and the deportation of Amir Ali Mukbil in 1873. They appointed a man of their own choosing (Husen Naji Zendani) Sheikh of Jihaf and its dependencies, and left him to rule in their name. Turkish troops again visited Jihaf at the time of the forward movement about 1885, when the Turks occupied Jalela, and invaded part of the country to the south of Jihaf. No Turkish troops visited Jabal Jihaf again until the military occupation made last year to forestall the operations of the Boundary Commission. When the Turkish nominee died, his son, Saleh Husen Zendani, was appointed Sheikh in his place; but during the whole time revenue has only been collected at irregular intervals, and none at all for the last seven years, as is shown by the record of taxes produced as evidence by the Turkish Commissioners. There are conclusive proofs, among them written admissions by the Zendani Sheikhs, that previously to the Turkish intervention the Amir was the recognized Chief of Jihaf. People have to a great extent adhered to their allegiance to him, in spite of the Turks, up to the present day. There have even been instances within recent years of the Sheikh appointed by the Turks having referred cases to the Amir as his Chief. (See paragraph 25, Dakkam.) Mafari, Azraki, Mihrabi, Ahmadi, Humedi. 14. The intricate hill country to the south of Jabal Jihaf, from the Dthala highlands on the east to the Tiban Valley on the west, is occupied by five tribes, the Mafari, Azraki, Mihrabi, Ahmadi, and Humedi, all owing allegiance to the Amir of Dthala. 15. The Mafari inhabit a big spur, which runs due south from Jabal Jihaf, and culminates in the very remarkable fortress-like bluff of Jabal Mafari. They have about twenty villages, and number about 1,000. 16. The Azraki inhabit a wide fertile valley south-west of Dthala, and several deep valleys among the rocky hills south of the Mashwara range. A large proportion are nomadic, but they have about twenty-five villages, and number about 1,200. 17. The Mihrabi inhabit the confused mass of barren, rocky hills to the south of the Mashwara range ; their villages, which are poor, number twentv-four, and the population is about 700 to 800. 18. The Ahmadi 'inhabit a mountainous tract on both banks of the Wadi Tiban. They have about forty villages, and number about 1,500. 19. The Humedi inhabit a mountainous tract with several very abrupt peaks on the left bank of the Wadi Tiban, north of the Ahmadi, and south-west of Jabal Jihaf; their villages and population number about the same as the Ahmadi. 20. The Turks claim all the above tribes as dependencies of Jihaf. Their dependence upon Jihaf has no existence beyond the assertion by the Turks, with a view to bringing them under the Sheikh whom they appointed u Sheikh al Mashayakh,” or Chief Sheikh, of the whole district. The only attempt at effective occupation prior to 1901 was made about 1886, when Turkish troops invaded the country, were vigorously resisted by the inhabitants, smd finally compelled to retire. Since then, beyond intrigue, the Turks have exercised no overt influence in this country until the military occupation of Jabal Mafari early in the present year, after the arrival of the Boundary Commission at Dthala. The chief evidence on which the Turks rely in support of their claim is the letter from Amir Ali Mukbil to the Resident at Aden in March 1875, in the translation of which, after the words “Azraki, Mihrabi, and Ahmadi,” is inserted “(country not belonging to the Amir).” (See paragraph 4 of inclosure to Aden Residency letter, dated the 1st November, 1901.) This insertion has been stated by the Resident to have been an unauthorized interpolation by the late Native Assistant Resident, Muhammad Saleh Jaffer, who was dismissed for malpractices in connection with the relations of the Residency with the tribes in the interior. Proofs of the Amir’s sovereignty over all these tribes are conclusive, since the days of the Imams up to the present time. Their close relations with him, and their acknowledg ment of his chieftainship, have been continuous.I V Dakham. banks of the Wadi 'nban'^It Sl , 0 i P&lt; * S ? f Jf l bal Jihaf ’ and P la!n country on both part is included in the territory 0 the i J' ^ P 0sition on the ™P. main The following brief historv of the tT “ ' D * he Imam ’ s fil ' mans Turkish rights over them and the vilidif'' 'f !]' su ® c . lent to s,10w the absence of any real 22.

Boundary recommended by British Commission. 28. The boundary which the British Commissioners consider should be claimed as representing the actual status in 1901 is shown by the green line on the accompanying map. It is conterminous with Turkish territory from a point near Lakmat-ash-Sh’ub, where it adjoins the Yafa (Shaibi) country on the east, till it meets the Haushabi limits on he south-west. It should run from Lakmat-ash-Sh’ub westwards between Kataba and San ah, including the Amiri villages of Jos-al-Jamal and Habil-as-Suk, following the Selat Kataba to its junction with the Wadi liban ; thence south-west and south, includin fr the Dakkam, Humedi, and Ahmadi lands on both sides of the Wadi to the Haushabi border near Jabal Warwa. The border districts on the Turkish side are Mares, Kataba, Al Yubi, A1 H Aiki, Al Hasha, Al Amara, and Al Humar. Between TTataba and the Humedi the country is unsurveyed owing to the determined opposition of the Turkish Commissioners to any British party visiting the disputed territory. Thus it is not known how far the Dakkam extend; but, as this tribe occupy villages high up the western slopes of Jabal Jihaf which it would be very undesirable to allow to fall into the hands of the Turks, it seems necessary to claim the tribe as a whole until the boundary is visited. At the same time, if it is subsequently found possible, without a serious sacrifice of the Amir’s rights, to curtail his claim in this direction, it may be possible to secure a satisfactory frontier without crossing the Tiban at this part of its course.8 Evidence in support of this Boundary. 29. The evidence on which the Amir’s claim to the boundary as defined above rests is given in the Appendices. It consists of:— . («.) The Amir’s accounts for the nine years ending with 1901, showing his actual revenue receipts for certain villages and tribes. (&amp;.) Documents relating to each of the tribes of recent date, i.e., from forty years ago up' to the present time. These contain acknowledgments by the Sheikhs of the Amir’s risht to their allegiance, and in most cases stipulations as to the amounts that they agree to pay him annually in cash or kind. (c.) Ancient documents dated from 80 to 300 years ago granting to the Amirs of Dthala, and confirming to them and their successors certain districts, of which the boun daries are specified. (d.) Letters from Faizi Pasha, Governor-General of Yemen, and from Turkish officials at Kataba, admitting the receipt of orders from the Porte to abstain from inter ference in the Amir’s territory. The above documents were produced before the Joint Commission. 1 he comments on them are given in Appendix 1 ; and the papers produced by the Turkish Commissioners in Appendix 2. Statements by the Sheikhs of all the tribes made before the British Commissioners, admitting their dependence on the Amir, are given in Appendix 3. &lt; Turkish Claim. 30. The Turkish claim throughout is based on the assertion of the sovereignty of the Sultan oyer all Arabia. They refuse to admit as valid any documents unsupported by Imperial Firmans. They ignore the rule of the Imams of Sana subsequent to the expulsion of the Turks in 1630, and on this ground treat the Firmans granted by the Imam to the Amir’s predecessors as of no value* They repudiate the admissions of the various Sheikhs regarding the Amir’s suzerainty on the ground that, as Turkish subjects, these Sheikhs had no power to transfer their allegiance from the Sultan to any other Power. (See Appendix 1.) 31. This general claim to sovereignty on the part of the Sultan has never been admitted by His Majesty’s Government. 32. The other documents submitted by the Turkish Commissioners in proof of taxes having been paid at one time or other by some of the Amiri tribes, so far from proving anv right to levy such taxes, are merely evidences of encroachments on Amiri territory, which have so often called forth the remonstrances cf His Majesty’s Government. 33. The British Commissioners have carefully limited the claim made by them on the Amir’s behalf to what they believe to be clearly established, and they consider that, without sacrificing his rights and those of the tribes concerned, no compromise^ can be admitted, except possibly in the case of the Dakkam, where, owing to the obstructive;attitude of the Turkish Commissioners, it has been impossible to ascertain the actual position as clearly as on other parts of the border. They think it advisable, however, to assert the Amir’s claim to this tribe until they have an opportunity of investigating the question on the spot. Importance of Jalela. 34. As regards Jalela, no settlement of the boundary can be satisfactory or permanent that does not involve the withdrawal of the Turkish garrison and of the Turkish claims to Jalela and the adjoining Shairi villages. The occupation, so long as it lasts, will remain a constant menace to the Amir, and a centre for intrigue in his territory. This occupation, in direct violation of the assurances given by the Porte, has never been acquiesced in by His Majesty’s Government, and thus no prescriptive title can be claimed. No compromise is possible here without serious loss of British prestige, which would react most unfavourably on the Arab population (who are closely watching events), and which -would probably make it impossible to continue the work of the Commission.

Criticism by the British Commissioners. As regards Nos. 1 to 6 , and Nos. 22 to 31, the British Commissioners reject as evidence atf documents prior to 1630 A.D., or about 1039 A.H., as Ottoman rule ceased to exist in l r emen from 1630 to 1872 A.D.. The fact that the Turkish Commissioners have failed to produce any documents bearing date between 1630 and 1872 is in itself presumptive evidence of the non existence of Turkish rule during this period of 242 years. As regards Nos. 7 to 21, they are all dated during occupation of Amiri territory, which is looked upon by the British Government as unjustifiable aggression persisted in in spite of repeated promises by the Porte to abstain from all interference in the Amir’s territories. The appointment of Sheikhs by the Turks, and their decoration by His Majesty the Sultan, cannot be recognized as proofs of sovereignty any more than would the appointment by the British Government of an Arab Sheikh as Governor of Yemen with the distinction of K.C.B.^ As to the receipts Nos. 32 to 56, they are dated during the period of Turkish occupation of Dthala. The ultimate withdrawal by the Turks in compliance with the remonstrances of the British Government Ivas a practical admission that the occupation was an act of aggression. Therefore, these receipts, so far from advancing the Turkish claim, help to prove that they were guilty of aggression. With regard to No. 57, the Resident at Aden has stated that a document in which these words occur was sent to the India Office. The phrase, however, was not used by the Amir, but was an unauthorized addition made by the Native Assistant Resident, which escaped notice at the time.declined.

We answered them : ‘ The Mafari Hill and its dependencies have been sold to Amir Shaif since the year 1281 before the Turkish expedition against us. We paid what was due by us to Amir Ali and Muhammad Mus ad, and after wards to Amir Shaif, whom we follow, and are under British protection. M hen they heard this they sent us a deputation of Arabs. One of our people became disloyal from fear, althougn he was one of those who originally arranged the sale to the Amir. He is a fool, and has no reputation.

Section 3. G^cJLM ^4- Private Letter from Mr. No. 1. G. H. Fitzmuurice to Foreign Office .— December 29.) British Camp, Dthala, Aden Boundary Commission, Aden, December 12, 1902. I ARRIVED here about three weeks ago to join this Commission sent here about a year ago to delimit the boundary between the nine protected tribes of the Aden hinterland and the Turkish Province of the Yemen. The Commission have not begun yet, and are not likely to do so unless the attitude of His Majesty’s Government changes. Having come to a deadlock about the Amiri tribes, tributary to the Amir of Dthala, the two Governments have decided to reserve the question for discussion and settlement at headquarters, i.e., in London or Constantinople, and both Commissions sent home about a fortnight ago a joint map setting forth their respective claims with detailed information on the subject. That Report (Commission’s No. 180 of the 2nd December) ought to reach the India and Foreign Offices about Christmas time. I feel con vinced that the whole question, one of great importance as regards the future safety of the Aden hinterland, hinges on the proper settlement of the Amiri difficulty ; that difficulty is not to be got over by transferring the discussion from here to London or Constanti nople. It is not the outcome of the personal relations of the two Commissions here, and as you can realize, just like the Turkish Commissioners here, who are simply the docile interpreters of the Sultan’s views on the subject, neither the Ottoman Embassy in London, nor any officials at Constantinople, appointed to discuss the matter with His Majesty’s Government, can possibly admit the justice of any one British contention without the special sanction or Irade of the Sultan—a sanction only to be obtained by pressure of a forcible kind. It seems imperative that His Majesty’s Government should make up its mind without further delay to tackle and get settled this Amiri matter, which is the crux of the whole question. For once the Turks have been compelled to evacuate the Amir’s territory, they will be much more amenable to reason, and the rest of the work of delimitation may be expected to go fairly smoothly and rapidly, more especially as the Haushabi border to the south-west was practically settled last year by the Ad Dareja incident, which has made the Turks very chary of interfering in that direction, while in a north-east direction the Yaffai (one of the nine tribes) are a big tribe well able to protect themselves, with our moral support, against ordinary Turkish encroachments—a fact which they proved conclusively some seven years ago when they repulsed a Turkish raiding expedition, inflicting on the latter heavy losses, including baggage and guns. The ordinary principles upon which a Boundary Commission should work are that the Commissioners on both sides, invested with powers to settle minor points, should be at liberty to move freely in, survey and collect information about, the debateable territory, i.e., the British Commissioners should have been free to proceed to the Azraki Ahmedi, Humedi, and Mihrabi districts (subject to the Amir of Dthala), as also to the country between Jalela [sc. Jelile) and a line south of Kataba. The Turks, however, whose Commissioners are not empowered to settle the most trifling point, immediately on the decision to send a Delimitation Commission, and acting on orders from the Sultan, ipade a rush and seized by force Jebel (Mount) Jihaf and Jebel Mafari, thus driving a wedge in between Dthala and the Azraki, Humedi, Mihrabi, &amp;c., dependents of the Amir of Dthala. Their sentries and Arab levies had orders to fire on, and actually did fire on, any peaceful British party proceeding in that direction, while they doubled their garrison at Jelil^ and brought up their one field and three mountain guns, which they posted on Jebel Shahad (Suheb), immediately south of Jelile and com manding the British camp, refusing to allow, under threats of firing on, any one attached to the British Commission to go beyond their Jelilfi lines to the Amir’s villages between [2314/—3] BJelile and Kataba. Despite the remonstrances of the British Commission and His* Majesty’s Government, they have maintained this attitude for over a year, committing' many hostile acts, already reported by the Commission, and although, in deference to threats by O’Conor of a use of force, the Sultan has given way a bit by ordering the temporary withdrawal of his regulars from Jebel Mafari, Jebel Jihaf, and the artillery posted on Jebel Shahad (Suheb), the guns are still at Jelile instead of being sent back to where they came from a year ago, and the irregulars, or “ bashibozaks,” are still posted on Jebel Jihaf and Mafari, with orders to fire on any British party approaching in that direction, the British Commissioners being thus forcibly prevented from visiting those regions, belonging as they do to the Amir, or the country of the Amir’s dependents, the Azraki, Mihrabi, Humedi, &amp;c. All this, while showing the bad faith of the Sultan when he proposed the Commission, and since, is a game of bluff, backed by a show of force as his only real argument, and would be at once abandoned by him if confronted by the same argument, but scarcely otherwise. He and his officials here have naturally been encouraged in^ it by the enforced attitude of the British Commissioners here, who, by their strict instructions to avoid complications (these instructions have really tended to making the situation more complicated), have been debarred, and have in turn debarred the Amir, from going beyond protests in resenting the conduct of the Turks, though both they and the Amir have thus been placed in a most humiliating, if not exasperating, position. The Sultan* through his Commissioners here, while thus drawing an iron fence round the British Commission to the west, north, and east, has had the audacity to claim a line partly shown on the joint map (attached to the British Commission s No. 180 of the 2nd December last), running not north-east but south-east about 12 miles to the south of Jebel Harir, then east some 8 miles till it reaches the stream called Wadi Baunu, then south down the Wadi Baunu to the south of the Yaffiai country, then in an easterly direction (leaving the whole Yafiai district Upper and Lower, together with the Aulaki within the Turkish sphere) and then south-east to the sea, giving Turkey access to the Hadramant. This willl show His Majesty’s Govern ment the preposterous and inadmissible nature of Turkish pretensions. They evidently act like the Oriental in a bazaar, who demands 20/. for a rug worth 3Z. in the hope that the European, tired of bargaining, will ultimately give 81. or 10/.; and the Ottoman Government cherishes the hope that His Majesty’s Government, its patience exhausted by their policy of bluff and obstruction, will finally be induced to compromise and consent to surrender some of the Amir of Dthala’s just claims, by drawing a line somewhere between the British and Turkish boundaries marked on the joint map. Of course underlying all this is their mythical theory, that, in virtue of their partial occupation of the Yemen between 1520 A.D. and 1630 A.D., the whole country down to Aden is Ottoman territory, and they are constantly telling the Arabs here that the British will be forced to withdraw to Aden, where the Sultan “ allows them to have a coaling station. The Turks again claim to have collected revenue from some Amiri villages, and show entries of the same in their books; but it should be distinctly understood that, in cases where these entries are genuine, they were the proceeds of organized raids of a fitful but most unjustifiable character rather than ordinary and regular administrative collection of revenue, while the villagers in most cases deny having paid such revenue, and have not the usual receipts for taxes paid—a fact which points distinctly to the rather doubtful authenticity of the so-called entries in the Kataba treasury books. The boundary of the Amiri territory as marked by the green, line on the joint map represents the Amir of Dthala’s strictly just rights and limits under present circum stances, and without going back to his 1873 boundaries, and constitutes an irreducible minimum, to the complete restoration of which he is entitled, if indeed he might not justly claim a large sum for territory unjustly seized by the Turks, as well as for the revenues of villages from which he has been excluded since the beginning of the Com mission, as also for the wanton destruction of the property of his subjects by the Turks and their agents during the last twelve months. It might, perhaps, be well to prefer such a claim and keep it hanging over the heads of the Turk to make him more amenable on other points. The Amir of Dthala has claims based on grants in writing by the Imams of Sana previous to the Turkish occupation of the Yemen in 1873 [vide Nos. 3, 4, and 6, of Appendix I to Commission’s Report on Amiri border of the 2nd December last in their No. 180 Secret) to Kataba, Damar, Taiz, Mavia, and other places outside the green line traced on the joint map of the Commission ; and if the limits of his jurisdiction weredrawn on the same principle as the line claimed by the Turks as Ottoman boundary (blue line on joint map), the Amir’s border would be traced as embracing Kataba, Damar, Taiz, Mavia, El Humar, &amp;c. The Ottoman Government since 1873, proceeding on the claim that Southern Arabia up to Aden is an integral portion of the Ottoman Empire in virtue of their partial occupation which ceased in 1630 A.D., have, in Constantinople and London, lulled the suspicions of and deluded His Majesty’s Government by their false assurances of non interference, while here on the spot, by the show and use of force in the shape of regular troops and guns, combined with intrigue, they have been pursuing a policy of intimidating the minor branches of the nine tribes and thereby disintegrating them, with a view to their gradual but final absorption ; and if His Majesty’s Government having allowed the Amir during the last twelve months to be forcibly dispossessed by the Turks, under the eyes of the British Commissioners and their large escort, of territory where only a year ago, before the formation of the present Commission, he was free to move and exercise his authority, does not insist on his being reinstated in territory to which, unlike the Turkish claims, his title is based on equity and moderation, he cannot possibly, after the departure of the Commission which has failed to secure him the protection he has a right to expect in virtue of his engagements towards us, be expected to remain loyal to the British connection. He will bow to the apparent inevitable, as a few of his Jebel Jihaf and Shairi dependent villagers have already done to a certain extent, and make the best terms he can with the Turks in the hope that any such arrangement will last his life time, with the result that Turkish intrigue in these parts will greatly increase, and the Ottoman authorities will be emboldened to continue the encroachments which it is the present purpose of His Majesty’s Government to put an end to. Already what has happened has put the Amir of Dthala’s loyalty and respect for us to a severe test, and he has frequently, and with justice, declared that his present position is worse than before the arrival of the Demarcation Commission. He has as frequently demanded permission to be allowed to turn out certain recently sent Turkish nominees and agents in Jebel Jihaf and Jebel Mafari villages, and the Commissioners have had considerable difficulty in so far restraining him from attempting to do himself justice. Moreover, the disastrous effect of any failure of the present Commission to afford him the measure of protection he claims will most certainly react on the neighbouring units of the nine tribes, causing them to waver in their allegiance and friendly attitude towards His Majesty’s Government. The basis of their friendship and loyalty to us is their detestation of Turkish mis rule, as seen in the Yemen, ancTtheir dread of its extension to their own territory. Tt is a firm and solid basis ; but during the last year’s stay of the Commission here, they have seen but the apparent strength of the Turks and the apparent weakness of the British, and the inevitable result of any capitulation of the Amir of Dthala’s rights to the Turks would be to sap the foundation of their loyalty and lead them to despise us for our seeming inability to compel the Turks to respect their engagements towards us. Any attempt to discuss and argue the Amiri question in London or Constantinople on the same lines as such a matter would be discussed with any other European Govern ment, must infallibly lead to a repetition of the same non possumus attitude, distortions of facts, and specious pleading of the Ottoman Commissioners here. The discussion will be spun out to interminable lengths with endless reference of every detail to the Sultan for his Irade, and such is obviously the object and expectation of the Sultan and his Government, in their hope of procuring a negative result of the present Commission as regards British claims and contentions. The arguments adduced by the British Commissioners are more to show His Majesty’s Government the justice of the Amir of Dthala’s claims rather than to enable His Majesty’s Government to convince the Ottoman Government of the baselessness of its pretensions, or to induce it to acknowledge the incorrectness of its conduct and its bad faith in these parts during recent years. The Turkish Government is im pervious in such matters to logic, reasoning, or facts which tell against them, relying as they do on bluff and a show of force, combined with misstatements and perversions of the truth ; and the only possible means of procuring the Amir the restoration of his territory, and thereby securing a sound border line, would seem to be, as advocated by Lord Dufierin in 1886, to bring the necessary pressure to bear either by a show or use of force here and at Hodeidah (more Italiano) to compel the Turks to respect the Amir’s border as indicated by the green line on the joint map of the Commission. [2314 ff —3] B 24 This ouP-ht to be decided on and acted upon without further delay. The patient of the tribes is already sufficiently tried, and the present cool season by land and sea is best suited to military or naval movements, as also to the work of demarcating the boundary of the Amir’s territory when once thus re-established. ^ It seems essential that the Commission should remain here until the Amin frontier ^ is definitely settled and laid down, both in order to carry out the work of demarcation of the frontier when the Turks shall have been compelled to respect it, and also because its departure from Dthala, without having accomplished anything, would at the present juncture be regarded by all the border tribes as a failure and a climb down for us. ... . . In any case, the departure of the Commission in a north-easterly direction, as at present instructed, is out of the question until the Turkish Government has instructed its Commissioners here, as the Sublime Porte was reported, in Sir H. Elliot s despatch to Foreign Office of the 6th June, 1873 * to have instructed the then Governor- General of the Yemen, Ahmed Eyoub Pasha : (1) to recognize the Yatfai (correct pro nunciation isYafa) as one of the nine tribes, and (2) to start in company with the British Commission from a point near the village of Luhmah-es-Shiub (and m a south-easterlv direction to the south of Jebel Harir, and then down the Wadi Baunu as now preposterously claimed by the Ottoman Commissioners), to demarcate m a north easterly direction up to the desert the boundary between the country of the rata (Yaffai) tribe and the Turkish districts of Marais and Beda. Instructions to the Ottoman Commissioners in the above sense will be more easily obtained from the Sultan after he has been induced to acquiesce in a proper settlement of the Amiri border. , , , , -i tz 4 . u As the Amiri question is the crux of the whole boundary question, so the Kataba Valley, including Jelile, is the crux of the Amiri difficulty, while again the evacuation by the’Turks of Jelile means the practical settlement of the Kataba Valley question. Jelile is a small village of some forty to fifty houses, within 2 to 3 miles of Dthala the Amir’s residence. The Turks dispossessed him of it some fifteen years back, but only occupied it in force (400 to 500 men with 1 field and 3 mountain guns) at the time of the appointment of the Commission. In view of Lord Granville’s despatch of the 15th May, 1873, declaring that His Majesty’s Government would not “ tolerate” the interference of the Ottoman authorities in the territory of the nine tribes, and the instructions sent in consequence to Anmed Eyoub Pasha, the then Vali of the Yemen (Sir H. Elliot’s of the 6th June, 1873), the Ottoman Government before occupying Jelile ought to have at least consulted His Majesty’s Government as to whether we considered it within the Aden hinterland. Bv not doing so they have put themselves out of Court, as indeed they have done by their whole conduct of stealthy encroachment during the last thirty years. The road from Yemen to Aden passes by Jelile, and the Turks have, through their Customs, purposely harassed Aden-bound caravans, with a view to diverting trade from Aden to Mocha and Hodeidah. Their efforts, too, have been attended by con siderable success, as shown by the Aden land-borne traffic Beturns. His Majesty’s Government, in their despatch of the 18th August last to 11 is Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople, said they did not recognize the Ottoman Govornment’s right to occupy Jelile and the few villages between there and Kataba, and the time has come to insist on their evacuating and restoring to the Amir of Dthala bis territory up to the border south of Kataba, as marked on the Commission s map accompanying their letter of the 2nd December. The forcible ejectment of the Turks from Jelile would be a very easy task, while a show of force here and at Dthala, together with the presence of two or three ships at Hodeidah, coupled with firm language at Constantinople, would probably produce the necessary result. The Turks have few troops in this part of the Yemen, while I am convinced that their force at Jelile has no authority to resist, and would at once retire on the application of force, referring the matter to the Vali of the Yemen, who, in turn, would refer it to the Palace—a matter of three to four days by their most rapid means of communication. Jelile is miles from the British camp at Dthala, while Kataba and the Amir s border, immediately south of that town, is from 7 to 8 miles from the British camp ; and it should not be forgotten that precisely^ the same effort and the same amount of pressure is required to make the Turks retire 8 miles as If miles. The boundary of the Amiri territory might be drawn in accordance with the situa- * In answer to Lord Granville’s despatch of the 15th May, 1873.tion h lS7 2 - 7 3, as shown above, many miles to the north of Kataba, without injustice ^ 07 0 Tu i r k? ’ ^ ut . as . His Majesty s Government has no desire to restore the status quo of 1873, and the Amir is reconciled to the loss of rights he has not exercised for many yeais back, the boundary traced by the British Commission, far from meaning an &gt; aggrandizement of the Amir’s territory, and an extension of the responsibilities of His Majesty s Government, simply means the abandonment by the Turks of the compara tively recent encroachments, and their respecting the assurances repeatedly given by them not to interfere in the territories of the nine tribes. The matter cannot give rise to any international question concerning the “ integrity or the Ottoman Empire, as it rather involves the integrity of a British dependencv somewhat flagrantly violated by the Turkish Government, and the latter’s best friends m Europe might find it more conducive to their interests to advise the Sultan to respect his past engagements in the matter. It seems, then, absolutely necessary that the Sultan should be compelled to recognize the limits of the Amiri territory as indicated by the green line on the Commissioner’s map ; that any compromise is out of the question, being incompatible with the Amir of Hthalas lights and the future tranquillity of the border, which His Majesty’s Government desires as the outcome of the present Commission, and that, after proper notification, the necessary pressure should without delay, and during the present cool season, be applied to the Sublime Porte to compel it to act up to its past engagements not to interfeie with Amiri territory as shown by the green line drawn on the joint map of the Commission. I have written you rather at length because the matter has a certain importance, because an unsatisfactory settlement of the question means further encroachments and the endangering the safety of the entire Aden hinterland, as well as the avoidance of future difficulties in the Hadramant—a district into which the Turks will certainly penetrate if we make any further (beyond those made since 1873) concessions to them in the Amiri or Yaflai districts. We are here about 80 to 90 miles inland from Aden, and 4,800 feet above sea. The climate is dry and fine; hot by day and cool by night. The country is full of villages, and well cultivated ; and one only marvels that during the last sixty years the Aden authorities have not got to know something of it. It is a mixture of Arabia Felix and Arabia Petrsea, for it is broken up into massive rock mountain ranges inter sected with rich and picturesque valleys. Bemember, if this Turkish nettle is grasped, it won’t sting, and their obstructive attitude will collapse all along the line. Further, failure here means a further decrease in our prestige at Constantinople, and vice versd. Yburs very sincerely, (Signed) G. H.

(Confidential.) ^ r ’ rpriTA o o Dthala, December 22, 1902. feecretar y of ^ate for India’s second telegram of the 11th December to the bovernment of India, Foreign Department, states that your Excellency will call for a separate Report from me “ On the general situation here, paying special attention to the questions—(1) Of the occupation of territory evacuated by the Amir; and (2) That of the point of departure from which north-east demarcation should start.” I presume the first means, the reoceupation by the Amir of his territory from which the Turks have forcibly excluded him since 1901. J 2. Your Excellency’s direct instructions have not yet reached me, but as postal com munications between here and Constantinople are defective, and to avoid delav, more especially as there remain but two months of cool weather in these parts, I venture to at once forward you the following observations on the points mentioned in the Secretary of State for India’s telegram :— J — re § ards the S enera l situation, there is little if anything to add to Colonel Wahab s Reports, including his No. 180, Secret, of the 2nd December on the Amiri border. When Lord Granville in 1873, especially in his despatch of the 15th May of that year enumerated the nine tribes to the Sublime Porte, through the British Embassy at Constan tinople, and declared that the British Government would not “ tolerate ” Turkish inter ference within their sphere, the Sublime Porte, at a time when it still possessed the powers and prerogatives of which the present Sultan has deprived it, was evidently acting in bad faith when it. gave the assurances reported in Sir Henry Elliot’s despatch of the 6th June, 1873, for the Turkish Commissioners assure us that Lord Granville’s list of the nine tribes is nowhere to be found in the archives of the Vilayet of Yemen at San’a, where the authorities have been acting on some fantastic enumeration of the nine tribes—partly sub-tribes in the immediate vicinity of Aden. 4. In 1873, and during the subsequent thirty years, the Turkish Government lias been deluding the British Government by false assurances as to its non-interferenceUn the territory of the nine tribes; while here, on the spot, it has carried on a policy of in and encroachment on the following lines :— 5. Working on the ridiculous and inadmissible pretension that the Ottoman Govern ment’s sovereign rights to all Southern Arabia resulting from its partial occupation of these regions between 1520 and 1630 had not been impaired by the 242 years enforced and complete absence of Turkish rule in Yemen between 1630 and 1872, they have been en deavouring, and with a large amount of success, to split up the tribes with a view to their gradual but final absorption. This policy, in the case of the Haushabi, was put a stop to by the Addareja incident of last year, while the arrival of the Boundary Commission has served to expose their similar methods as regards the Amiri. 6. As your Excellency is doubtless aware, the tribes in these parts are often a federation of clans, each ruled by a Sheikh, under the suzerainty of a Chieftain called fc the Sheikh of the Sheikhs” (Arabic, ‘’Sheikh al Meshaikh ”), or Head Sheikh, to whom each clan owes its allegiance and pays tribute, and whose call to arms it is bound to obey. The [1804 &lt;7—1] B*ii II If Turks, by taking advantage of internal quarrels, or the personal ambition of some petty • oheikh, by bribery, and appeals to Islamic sentiments, have, to a certain extent, disintegrated the border tribes. 7. In the case of the Amiri, they ignore the existence of a tribe called “ Amiri,” main- ^ aimng that the Amir of Dthala is not the ic Shiekh al Meshaikh ” of the Amiri tribe, but simply the Sheikh of Dthaia ; while they have, as set forth in the Commission’s Report i\o. 180 of the 2nd December last, taken advantage of the ambition and cupidity of a minor Sheikh of Jebel Jehaf to nominate him “Sheikh al Meshaikh ” of Jebel Jehaf and its dependencies “Jebel Mafari, Azraki, Humedi, Ahmadi, Mihrabi, and Dakkam’’ Having appointed him they left him to establish his authority, lending him their moral and, as their military occupation of Jebel Jehaf and Jebel Mafari has shown, their material support when necessary. As shown in the Commissions Report on the Amiri border the Sheikhs of Azraki, Humedi, Ahmadi, and Mihrabi repudiate the authority of the Turkish nominee of Jihaf, while the Sheikh of Mafari has declared that he will return to his allegiance as soon as Turkish pressure is withdrawn, a course which the people of Jehaf are sure to follow. 1 8. The Amir of Dthala has claims based on grants in writing by the Imams of San’a previous to the Turkish occupation of Yemen in 1872, to Kataba, Damar, Ta‘iz, Mavia, and other places beyond the green line on the ^joint map of the Commission, and a line embracing these places shows the extent of Turkish encroachments during the last thirty years. It is apparently the present intention to condone these past encroachments, with the exception of the village of Jalela, and the three neighbouring villages of Jalas, Ai ab h, and Lakmat al Hajfar, the Turkish right to occupy which His Majesty’s Govern ment has refused to recognize in the Foreign Office despatch of the 18th August, com municated to the Sultan’s Government through His Majesty’s Embassy, Constantinople. y. It is their unjustifiable military occupation of Jalela and the adjoining villages coupled with the reluctance of His Majesty’s Government to take the necessary steps to compel their evacuation, which has enabled the Sultan and his Government to render impossible the Commission’s efforts to arrive at a fair settlement of the Amiri border and to delimit it. 10.

Ce. Ci£t3-c ^ It seems to me impossible to refuse our consent to the I.O. proposal. But it will probably be better that our Com missioners should make sure of the attitude of one Yaffai Sheikhs before we commence operations. This can be suggested to the I.O.- the poin^ however is one which can most conveniently be settled upon the spot. I understand that the p^rjposal now before us does not contemplate any immediate steps for turning the Turks out of the places which they have occupied in Amiri territory. This question had probably better be reserved until the Delimitation of the frontier towards the N.E. has been accomplished. If however in the meantime there were to be fresh acts of encroachment on the part of the Turks or fresh attempts to obstruct the Commission by force we should in my opinion be justified in clearing them cut of everything inside the Wahab line. Whether that line might hereafter be modified is a matter whichJ^L,*gr Foreign Office. 6 January 1903. &gt;(■ 8 JAN 1903 ) Sir, I have laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne your letterof. the 2nd instant respecting the present position of the Aden Delimitation Commission. The Secretary of state for India suggests that. in consequence of the state of affairs reported by the Resident at Aden in his telegram of the 3lst ultimo^His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople should be directed to press for the immediate despatch of instructions to the Tur kish Commissioner^ to meet the British Commissioners at Lakmat - a s h - s hub and proceed thence to demarcate the northern bounda- -ries of the Upper Yaffai country and that His Excellency should inform the Porte at the sane time that, if these instructions are not obeyed,the British Commission will proceed to ascertain those boundaries and that the British escort will be instnacuu) to deal summarily with any attempt to interfere with the British lines of communication and to repel by force any movmment which may be made by theany of the points from which they have withoiawn or to the establishment of fresh posts within the disputed limits. It will he seen from Sir N.O Conor’s telegram No 2 of the 5th instant of which a copy was communicated to you on the following day,that His Excellency has alre^ady made a communication to the Grand Vizir and the Minister for Foreign Affairs pressing for instructions to the Turkish Commissioner* in the sense suggested and intimating the course which His Majesty’s Government will pursue if such instructions are not given without delay. If it should prove necessary to do so Lord Lansdowne is prepared to instruct sir N.O* conor to repeat this information in a more formal manner with a warning as to the instructions which will he given to the British escort,as soon as it has been ascertained that a sufficient force is available and that the necessary arrangements have been made with the Yaffai chiefs for the passage of the British Commission through their country. X; 4 /My Lord, I pressed and I am afraid worried the Grand vizier very considerably yesterday about the Aden Boundary taking my theme from the Resident’s Telegram of the I9th instant showing clearly the bad faith of the Sultan, Porte or the Minister of War„ I said that the obstruction and subterfuges of the Commission seemed to be boundless but that I could not answer for it that the patience of H.M.Govt would be equally extensive. I need not weay Your Lordship by going over the ground over which I travelled, particularly as the Grand vizier was ready to agree in my expression of dissatisfaction at the difficulties and ddlay cropping up &amp; every moment. His Highness said th&amp; after I had spoken to him a week ago hw had discussed the matter in the Council of Ministers where he had fallen very foul of the Minis ter for far who said Tewfik Pasha had no right or authority to admit that Yaffai was one of the Nine Cantons an d more to the same effect. The Grand vizier maintained that the notes exchanged with H.M Govt in I8?3 left no doubt upon this point without seeking fur ther proof in the more recent note of Novi last which by dfcfini&amp;g that the frontier line should ^e drawn N.E to the desert automatically included Yaffai within I the British zone. His Highness then went on to prove ■ to hos colleagues that the proceedings of the Yemen Authorities The Marquess of Lansdowne K &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.Authorities and Tuiricish Commissioners would ultimately lead to serious complications with England and he urged th&amp; instructions should he sent to the Military com mandant to put a stop to these proceedings,. He thought his words had had their effect and he asked me to reserve further discussion of the subject till after the Council of Ministers on the 4th proximo when he hoped to he able to give me satisfactory information. His Highness thenread to me a telegram from the Vali of the Yemen stating that a Sheikh named Hussein had appealed to him affirming that jehaf and Mafari had been from time immemorial part of the district of Taiz and th&amp; the inhabitants were unwilling to be placed under the Sheikh of Dthali. The Vali further st ated that- the Turkish commissioners had applied to him for instructions stating th&amp;‘ whilst they were prepared to delimitate to the North Eafct , the British com missioners had put forward the pretension that the Yaffai tribe, which it was known belonged from time immemorial to the Vilayet of the Yemen , was one o| the Nine cantons. His Highness had^iold me conf identi&amp;lly , relertred these telegrams to thM Minister for Foreign Alfa^xs but His Excellency instead of stating that the Yaffiai was, as he had admitted to no , within the British zone, merely remarked that Questions oi a con^roveisial naouie must be reserved! for examination later on between the two Goverhments. The Grand Vizier seems fairly confident that he will succeed in settling matters satisfactorily at the next Council of Ministers. It is clear however that the MinisterMinister of war now understands the mistake his Govt m a made in consenting to a delimitation of the frontier NoEo to the desert, that he realises, which he probably did not do at the moment, that it closes all possible advance of the Turks to the Hadramaut, andthat he is making every effort to extricate himself from a position into which his Govt was unwittingly led but which is defirea and established by an Imperial irade and an official note from the Porte e I have &amp;c 0 (sd) NoO 1 Conor • X /mm MICROFILMED DOCUMENT DO NOT PHOTOCOPY USE IOR NEG Record Dept.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000396_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/65</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000396</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/65</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 37/1905 Pt 3 'Aden Frontier Delimitation'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1903/1903</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-11-04T14:38:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (758 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.The Subject 37 (Aden) contains 5 files, IOR/L/PS/10/63-67.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 758; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence and documents related to the work of the Aden Boundary Commission, the British Government body tasked with the delineation of the borders of the British Protectorate of Aden.
