Geographical, Administrative, and Political Divisions. J I. S. ’Arabistan. II. N. I. 8. ’Arabistan on the N. includes Shakheh, and the boundary runs W. just excluding Alwanleh, and strikes the Ab-i-Gargar at the A1 Haddam ndld m. N. of Bandd-Qir. It leaves the r. b. of the Gargar at Khar Rawaishid 5| m. above the same place, which is thus included in this province. Further to the W. it follows the W. and N., boundaries of the ’Anafijeh, crossing the Diz, and continuing concurrently with the external boundaries of the Hawlzeh district. The boundary between the Ahwaz, or Karun district, and that of Muhamimreh crosses the Karun between Sab*eh and Qajarleb. S. ’Arabistan may now be held to include Hawlzeh, which the Shaikh of Muhamimreh administers, for the Persian Government, through the local Shaikhs. S. ’Arabistan is under the administration of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, Shaikh Khaz’al, Sardar Arfa’, Mu’izz-us-Saltaneh. He is represented by Deputy Governors at Ahwaz, Fallabieh, JarrahT (Khalfabad and Ma’shur) and Hindian; but such men have very limited powers of initiative, acting almost entirely on orders received from Shaikh Khaz’al. Everywhere the tribes are ultimately dealt with through their own chiefs. II. N. 'Arabistan .—This part of the Province is properly speaking directly administered by a Persian Governor appointed from Tehran. Its sub-divisions are— (i) The Shushtar district, including the town of that name, most of the Mianab, the ’Aqili district, Ab-bid and Pawin- deh towards Dizful. It may also perhaps be considered as in cluding the section of the Bait Sa’ad ’Arabs on the Diz, under Shaikh Farhan As’ad. This tribe is also known as the Cha'ab-ud-Dubais, and formerly as the Al Kathir of Shushtar. The ’Anafijeh on the r. b. of the Shatait and on the lower Diz are subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh. 61. B. A2 (ii) Dizful district, including the town of that name, and Kau- nak, and the country stretching thence across the Diz to the Karkheh or thereabouts. On the W. of the Diz the district includes Salihabad to the N. W., and, according to general report, Qilab, Nominally the administrative area of this district extends to - the Turko-Persian boundary, but the intervening country is occupied by portions of the Bani Lam, Turkish subjects but practically independent. (iii) Ramuz district, including Mar Bacheh on the W. Kaleh-i- Shaikh on the S., .and marching with Behbehan on the E,: this district is administered for the Persian Government by the Bakhtiari Khans. General descriftion of ’Arabistdn .—’Arabistan is divided by its principal rivers into five main geographical districts. To the N. W., the Karkheh, Diz, Shatait and Gargar enclose three “ Doab ” as they would be called in Upper India. To the S. E., the Karan, Jarrahi and Hindian Rivers enclose two similar tracts. The whole of ’Arabistan is one vast alluvial plain, broken only by stony undulations between Dizful and Shushtar, and by the low hills which run from Nasiri N. W. to the Perso-Turkish boundary and S. E. towards Behbehan. Prom the Perso-Turkish boundary to the Karun stretches a flat' desert, uninterrupted by hills, and broken only by the extensively 1 wrigated tract of Hawizeh. Except for a narrow strip along the Karun it is uninhabited, save by nomads in the vicinity of- Hawizeh, whose dependence on the Shaikh is not yet complete. The Karun, the largest and only really navigable river of Persia, flows between high mud banks, which gradually decrease m eig . as the sea is approached, until, near Mavid, they almost disappear, and the land on either side consequently becomes liable to flood when the river is high. Its course, though tortuous, is fairly permanen . xcept for a mile near ’Ali-ibn-al-Husain, and near U - 1 * ? ee . nis no * ho have deviated from its present course within historical times. Its current is usually slow, from sLlL f P er lumr ’ except when in flood.; Its bed is broad and • ) ' r e m 1 0s * P&amp; r h at low water, but it is never fordable as drawWnP 8 ^ t makes navigation by steamers drawing about 3 '0' possible all the year round! . aid hhe banks makes irrigation possible only by the aid of large dams,, and there is consequently no irrigation nowattempted on this river, except for a few “ bucket-lift wheels, ^ worked by animals, and tidal canals near Muhammareh. A v ; In Sassanian times there is no doubt that a large area on the E. bank of the Ka mn was irrigated, ; whilst the country on the W. bank was . extensively irrigated from the Karkheh until the middle of the last century. - . ^ T Major Morton, R. E.^ who was deputed in 1906 to examine the prospects of irrigation in S. ’Arabistan reported that it was undoubtedly feasible to construct a dam at Ahwaz with canals dependent thereon, watering the east bank; and that without interfering with existing navigation rights, such works could be made to yield a substantial profit. No further steps have, however, been taken. Lt. Wilson, I.A., examined the Karkheh at Kut NahrHashim in May 1909 with a view to irrigation, and reported that it was possible to build a stone dam on the rapids there, and that such a dam would turn water into the old canals which stretch thence to within a few miles of Aminieh, and were in use within the last fifty years. Such a scheme, he thought, would irrigate 250,000 acres, and offered no practical or serious political difficulty. Prom the Karun to the Jarrahi stretches another desert, flat,, barren, and broken only by occasional depressions usually full of salt water, and connected, in flood time, with the Jarrahi, or the creeks leading to the sea. Into such a depression flows the Malih stream which may be surmised to occupy a former bed of the Karun. Here and there in the desert are groups of wells, with one or two mud huts near by. In early summer these spots are the centres for nomad shepherds, who are too far from the rivers to water their flocks from them. Later on, when rain has fallen, the shepherds leave the wells, and rely on pools and puddles to water their flocks. The Jarrahi River, with a volume of water scarcely one4enth that of the Karun, nevertheless supports by means of irrigation ten times as large a population. This striking contrast is due to the lowness of the banks of the Jarrahi, which permit of irrigation by the clumsy and half-hearted methods of the modern Arab. Prom Buzleh to Khalfabad, the Jarrahi is navigable for small boats, and a considerable and increasing quantity of mer chandise is carried to Ramuz by this route. Prom Madlneh southwards, the water of the Jarrahi is spread by a network of canals over the country on either bank, and its waters only reach the sea after passing through date grove$ into the marshes, which in their turn drain into the Khor Buzleh or the A 24 Khor Silaik. A little water, however, is taken off by the Muham- mareh-Fallalueh canal, and discharged into the Kanin. Until about 1766 Madineh was the principal centre of popula tion; subsequently, however, Fallahfeh came into prominence, after the construction of the large canals which surround it. The Muhammareh-Fallahieh canal, originally about 12' wide, leads from the JarrShI canal system to the M3.rid creek on the Karun. Starting from Fallahleh, it traverses date groves for 6 or 7 miles, and here is deep and broad, fordable only in autumn. It then enters the marshes, which absorb most of its water, leaving only an exiguous stream, 4' or 6' wide and 3' deep, which flows without further diminution to Mar id : the last four miles of the canal are affected by tides in the Karun. River-boats with only 4' of beam and drawing 2' only of water, can use the canal, and 30 or 40 such boats daily make the journey between Muhammareh and Fallahleh. The JarrdhlrHindian dodh is a desert, flat, barren and unbroken by mud huts, depressions or marshes. It is less inhabited than any other tract in ’ Arabistan, and only one track crossing it (that from Ma’shur to Deh Mulla) is in common use, The Hindian 'River is not unlike the Karun on a small scale, its banks are high and steep, its course very winding and its current slow. Both banks are inhabited by Arabs whose hamlets, at intervals of 3 or 4 miles, extend from Hindian to Zaidan. A largish canal takes off at a point near Gargarl on this river, and waters the country on the W. bank as far as Deh Mulla. There is little doubt that a small expenditure op further canals in this district would be richly rewarded, The soil is well suited for irri gation, and ip fact throughout ’Arabis'an, there is remarkably little ground that is not susceptible of cultivation. The east boundary of ? Arabisfan lies a few farsalchs beyond the Hindian River ; on the other side live the Llrawl Arabs, of the same race as those of 'Arabistan, but under the jurisdiction of Bars. The coast of S. , Arahistan .—For some 30 miles, the Shatt-al- ’Arab is the S. boundary of S. ’Arabistan, and of Persia. Along the shores of Abbjidan I., and to a less extent on either bank of the Karun, the country is covered with a network of tidal canals, watering the date groves from which the Shaikh derives a Jarge revenue, The Bahmanshir R, is similarly utilized, Band5 so f irrigated is very valuable, and produces excellent dates, but offers difficulties to the passage of troops, - Prom the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab, E. to Dilam, the coast is unapproachable by large ships, owing to extensive and con stantly changing sand-banks. Boats up to 40 tons burthen can navigate the creeks leading to the harbours of Buzleh, Ma’shur and Dilam, and ascend the river to the port of Hindian. Buzieh is a small village consisting principally of shops at the N, end of the narrow tidal creek, connected with Khor Musa. Native boats up to 40 tons come up the creek to this port, and discharge cargo, which is transferred to small ballams on a canal 200 yards away whence there is direct communication by water all the year round with Khalfabad : direct communication by water between Buzleh and Pallahieh, and between Pallahieh and Khal fabad is possible only during spring and early summer , when there is sufficient water to enable boats to surmount the dam at Darreh Khazlneh. Ma’shiir is a port of less importance than Buzieh (likewise connected with the Khor Musa), and without communication by water with the interior. It is largely used by grain exporters, but the rest of its trade is artificial, being almost wholly due to the facilities for evading Customs dues. Hindian is like Ma’shur used by grain exporters. Ballams ascend the river as far as Deh Mulla, but it appears that little mer chandise is carried in this way. Hindian depends upon the pat ronage of Behbelian for the bulk of its trade ; but being two days’ march further from that town than is the port of Dilam, the latter is chiefly used by Behbehanis, unless political exigencies, or dis turbances on the Dilam road make it convenient to import goods via Hindian. The coast from Buzieh to is flat, muddy, and inter sected by creeks. The tide recedes as much as three miles in places owing to the flatness of the coast, whilst high tides, combined with a favourable wind, force the water a considerable distance in land, Thus in spring at high tide, the village of Ma’shur is fre quently practically surrounded by water. For details of the Ramuz district see . Part I of this Report (Bakhtiari Garmslr) and the P. G. G. Political. ’Arabistan ranks as one of the principal provinces of Persia, and is governed by a Governor appointed from Tehran. Dizful6 • (afad Shushtar in the absence of the Governor) are under a Deputy Governor appointed by him. Ram Hormuz is also ruled by a Deputy-Governor appointed by arrangement with the Bakh- tiari Khans, from among whom he is selected. Ram Hormuz is thus, except for revenue purposes, practically a part of the territory controlled by the Bakhtiari Khans. The rest of the Province—described above as S. ’Arabist m— ia ruled by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who, though nominally under the Governor of 'Arabistan, is to a large extent autono mous, though of course he pays the taxes demanded according to custom by the Central Government at Tehran. He is far more influential than the Governor, who is usually a nonentity ’only able to retain his position by favour of the Shaikh and of the 'Khans. ' i ' ■ 1 : : The Shaikh's relations with the B have for some years been of a very friendly nature. His interests are, in the main, our interests, and he fully realizes the prospective value of our assistance and protection in the contingency of an attack upon him by the Turks, or an attempt on the part of the Persian Govern ment to oust him, or deprive him of his practically autonomous position. He has never opposed any scheme calculated to increase the material interests of Great Britain in his territory, though, of course, he drives as good a bargain as he can when leasing land, .etc. .. . ..... ..... Relations with the Persian Government. —Although it is danger ous and misleading to make comparisons it may be said of the Shaikh that, from an administrative point of view, his position is not unlike that of some rulers of native states in India. The Customs, Posts, and Telegraphs are managed by the Persian Government, but the Shaikh has a considerable, if undefined, influence in the administra tion of the first named, his goodwill being essential to its effective management. A “ Karguzar, ” or Persian Foreign Office Agent, resides at Muhammareh, and questions regarding Karun naviga tion, subjects of Foreign Powers, slaves, etc., are referred to him. For the rest, however, the administration is practically entirely in the hands of the Shaikh. ’ ; ! - . , Relations with other Foreign Powers.—Turkey excepted tnfia), it may be said that the Shaikh has no relations worthy of the name with other Foreign Powers. Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., a German firm, have rented a piece of land some 70 yards by 96 half-way between the British Consulate and the town, on' the right bank of the Karun, on an 8 years’ lease, for 1000 tumans a year, at the e d of which period all the buildings erected by the lessee will become the property of the Shmkh. , .( 3 ) ; The Shaikh's relations with the Bakhtiari.-^lvi 1907 a treaty {vide Appendix I) was signed by Shaikh Khaz'al and several of the Bakh- tiari Khans, which promised among other things mutual friend-, ship, and mutual assistance in case of external aggression. It re mains to be seen how far this treaty wi 1 prove to be effective : all that can be said is that the interests of the signatories on matters of general policy run on parallel lines. The Shaikh has of late years entered into cordial relations with Shaikh Mubarak of Kiiwait, and in 1908 received very substantial assistance from him, in the form of a large number of rifles and cartridges on loan for use against the Bani Turiif. The object of his entering into such close relations with Shaikh Mubarak is not clear, but it is a factor to be reckoned with in the future. Shaikh Mubarak, like Shaikh Ki az’al, owns much land on the Turkish bank of the Shatt-al- ’Arab, and this gives him an excuse for paying frequent visits to Failleh. Relations with the Turkish Government. —The Perso-Turkish boundary is for about 200 miles that of the Shaikh’s territories, and the important commercial centre of Basrah is less than 20 miles from 5 Muhammareh. It is therefore natural that the Shaikh should have more or less close relations, both political and commercial, with his * western neighbours. Furthermore, many ’Arab tribesmen, though Turkish subjects, acknowledge him as their chief and flock to his standard when called upon, as in 1908. : t On the other hand the Bam Turuf near Hawlzeh, whilst little under the control of any central authority, are almost as closely * allied to Turkish as to Persian Arabs as far as their tribal relation ships are concerned ; and in case of an attempt on the part of the 1 Shaikh to enforce his authority such tribes would find a ready &gt; asylum in Turkish territory. The possibility of an attack upon Muhammareh by the Turks, and the defenceless state of that town, and of his palace at Failleh, makes the Shaikh look with anxiety upon any measures calculated to strengthen the hold of Turkey upon Mesopotamia, and it is not im probable that Shaikh Mubarak’s fellow-feeling in this matter has contributed towards cementing the friendship alluded to above. For this reason, if for no other, the Shaikh of Muhammareh is likely to throw himself more and more into the hands of the British Gov ernment. . Relations with the Sag wand. —The Shaikh of Muhammareh’s interests extend W. of the R. Diz to, the extreme N. W. of 5 Arabistan, and it is in this direction that he comes into, contact with8 the Sagwand and the semf-independent Ban! Lam Arabs. It is a mat ter for regret that the Shaikh has never been able to arrange to co operate with the Bakhtiari and the Vail of Pusht-i-Kuh to put an end to the depredations committed by a small section of the Sag wand and the Ban! Lam. This is not entirely his fault, as when in 1907 he attempted to arrange something of the kind, the Dizfulis, fearful of the vengeance of the Sagwand, gave them sanctuary with in the city. This did not encourage the Shaikh to take further steps in the matter. The Sagwand have now (1908) become more daring, and several villages between the Karkheh and Dizful have per force been abandoned. There is little doubt that were the control of Luristan entrust ed to the Vail of Pusht-i-Kuh he would successfully bring these Sagwands under control, and the same result would no doubt accrue from combined operations against them by the Shaikh and tbe^Vali : the latter alternative is, in this part of Persia, beset by almost in superable difficulties. In any case, the Shaikh has little at stake, and would not move unless with the approval and financial assist ance of the Persian Government. Relations with the Government of Fdrs .—The E. boundary of ’Arabistan is conterminous with that of Pars, and the local Govern ment of Behbehan, far removed from the central authority at Shi raz, has for some years been under the influence of the Bakhtiari Khans and the Shaikh, the Deputy Governor being appointed first from one party, then from the other, or by mutual agreement : on the whole, however, the Bakhtiari have the upper hand, the Shaikh’s nominee not having been successful. It is enough here to say that the wishes of the Shaikh of Muhammareh are generally a factor to be considered in appointing a Deputy-Governor for Behbehan. The ’Arab tribes living in the Lira vl district (a coastal region ex tending from Hindi an toDilam) occasionally raid villages in ’Arab- istan, giving rise to reprisals, but there is no danger to be feared from this direction. The Shaikh and his subjects.—At least 95 per cent, of the Shaikh's subjects are Arabs, speaking Arabic as their mother tongue, and very often unable to understand Persian. Distinct in language, race, (iress, and customs from the “ ’Ajami ” or Persian-speaking Lurs, they would not tolerate the rule of anyone not of their own race. The Shaikh, in addition to being the acknowledged ruler of the’Arabs of 'Arabistan, is also the head of a large and power ful tribe, the Muhaisin, and as such gains additional weight and in- nuence with his subjects at large* ~9 As chief of the ’Arabs of ’Arabistan he rules with the consent, im plied if not expressed, of the elders of the various tribes. This very shadowy remnant of the elective principle has never been put to the test, but it is possible that if the Shaikh adopted a line of action strongly repugnant to the declared wishes of his subjects, his ass assination might be effected by the combined action of tribal leaders, as happened in the case of Sh .ikh Miz’al. The Shaikh is also the largest landowner in ’Arabistan, own ing the larger portion of the date groves in his territory : it is in this capacity that he is most likely to excite the dislike or disapproba tion of his subjects. The present incumbent, Shaikh Khaz’al, is feared and respect ed, if not liked, by his subjects, and has no difficulty in securing obedience to his orders E. of the Karun; the very moderat; suc cess which has attended his efforts in Hawizeh is due rather to his own unwillingness to bring matters to a conclusion than to any inherent difficulties. The consent of the tribal council that meets monthly at Failieh to discuss tribal matters, and consists of the headmen of the tribes of the Muhaisin,' is obtained by the Shaikh to all steps of importance affecting tribal interests. The lease of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was signed by the tribal council in 1909. _ His son Chasib is at present (1908) a young man of about 18, with some education, but apparently little moral or physical strength. Commercial. The commercial interests of ’Arabistan are centred in Shushtar, Dizful, Muhammareh, Nasirl, and Ramuz, this being roughly their order of importance. ♦ Behbehan is not within the limits of ’Arabistan, but obtains a fair proportion of its goods through Muhammareh and Nasirl: a small quantity is also obtained through Hindian, and perhaps from Ramuz. ShusJitar is a large town of some 20,000 inhabitants, in the centre of the most fertile part of ’Arabistan. It has a large retail trade in foreign imports, such as cloth, tea, sugar, etc., and is a centre for the wool, cotton, and grain trade. The export trade in wool and cotton is entirely in the hands of native merchants. Shushtar is also a forwarding depot for a large proportion of the merchandise which reaches Central Persia from Muhammareh: Dizful 6 I. B. B10 also is to a large extent dependent upon Shushtar for its supplies of imported merchandise. The natural advantages of Shushtar are few : it is 5 miles from Shalili, the terminus of steamers plying on the upper Karim from Ahwaz. It is separated from Dizful by the Ab-i-Shatait, the bridge over which has long been broken, the only substitute being an ex tensive and not very safe ferry. It is only 2 stages nearer Isfahan than is Nasiri, but this is counterbalanced by the greater cheapness of food and grain at Shushtar than at Nasiri, which makes Shushtar not Nasiri a centre for mules. However, for the present, there is more business done in Shushtar than in any other town. Dizjul draws the bulk of its imports from Muhammareh via Nasiri, or via Nasiri and Shushtar. A small trade is carried on between Dizful and Baghdad and other Turkish towns, but the distance and the disturbed state of the country prevent this trade from assuming large proportions. The trade between Dizful and Kirmanshah, and Dizful and Burujird via Khurramabad is at pre sent at a standstill owing to the unsettled state of the surrounding country. . , ,. ' Nasiri is of considerable importance. As the head-quarters of Messrs. Lynch Bros., the transhipping depot for through traffic between Muhammareh and Shushtar, and the point of departure for caravans for Isfahan, Bamuz, and also (when practicable) Dizful, its importance is not likely to decrease. Nasiri is the winter head-quarters of the British Vice-Consul for ’Arabist?,n, with the local rank of Consul, but his interests are mainly political and not commercial. He is an officer of the Foreign Dept, of the Govt, of India. In favourable years, which occur only twice or three times in a decade, Nasiri becomes a centre for grain traffic. The compara tively small population of Nasiri prevents its retail trade from be coming important. The native merchants of Shushtar and other towns have agents at Nasiri, but do most of their business else where : except Messrs. Lynch Bros, and Messrs. P. Ter Meulen &amp; Co., a Dutch firm, no other firms of standing have their head-quar ters at Ahwaz: Asfar &amp; Co., a native firm, has occasionally kept an agent at Ahwaz, but so f ar little success has attended his opera tions. It should be noted that the figures in the Annual Consular Re ports, showing the volume of traffic on the Ahwaz-Isfahan road are misleading, as they shew only the traffic of Messrs. Lynch Bros., from Ahwaz, and take no count of other merchants’ opera tions. It should also be borne in mind that the volume of traffic ,0 11 on the Bakhtiari road is probably 4 times as great from Shushtar as from Nasirl, in ordinary years. Muhammareh is a port of call for ocean-going steamers* The weekly mail steamers of the B. I. S. N. Co. have put it within 5 days of Karachi, 7 days of Bombay, and there is in addition a weekly slow Service to every port of importance on the Persian Gulf. It is within 20 miles of the Turkish port of Basrah, and suffers from its competition. A British Consul of the Foreign Dept, of the Govt, of India has his head-quarters at this port, which is also the head-quarters of the Persian Customs Service of ’ Arabistan. The “ karguzar ” or Persian Foreign Office Agent at Muhammareh has already been referred to. . Muhammareh derives most of its importance from the traffic on the Karun, but it is also a local distributing centre of some im portance, and the small ports of Buzleh and Ma’shur, together with the town of Fallahieh (connected with Muhammareh by the Falla- hieh-Marid canal) depend upon Muhammareh for no small propor tion of their imports, illicit or otherwise. The presence of an Indian P. 0. in Muhammareh facilitates the remission of money to Bombay, and the total thus remitted is seldom less than Rs. 5,000 weekly, and sometimes as much as Rs. 20,000 weekly. Merchants with head-quarters at Shushtar, Dizful or elsewhere usually have an agent at Muhammareh to attend to the clearing and forwarding of goods, and the despatch of remittances, but large drafts on Bombay are more easily sold in Shushtar. Messrs. Lloyd Scott and Co., Agents, Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, Limited, have their head-quarters in Muhammareh, and do business as general merchants. Messrs. Lynch Brothers also have an agency with a European occasionally in charge. At the present moment the rupee is practically the principal current coin in Muhammareh, and is freely accepted by all classe3 t but this is not so elsewhere than in Muhammareh. The annual Consular Reports should be consulted regarding statistics and details of the trade of ’Arabistan generally. Details regarding weights and measures will be found in Part I of this report, and in the P. G. G. Rdmuz is largely dependent for its imports upon Nasiri, but the facilities offered for smuggling by the ports of Buzleh and Ma’shur are tending to divert the import trade from Nasiri to these harbours. From Ma’shur goods are imported by caravans, which b 212 accomplish the journey in three stages. From Buzieh the goods are taken to Khalfabad on the Jarrahi in whence it is only SO miles, or two short stages, to Ramuz. Ram Hormuz is in the centre of a small but fertile grain-pro ducing district, and in favourable years a considerable export trade is effected via Nasiri, or via Ma’shur or Buzieh in these com- modities. The Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ld., a British Company holding a concession for the exploitation of oil in the greater part of Persia, has not at present any borings in ’Arabistan. But its pipe-lines, from borings in the Bakhtiaii Garmsir and elsewhere, have to pass through ’Arabistan cn voutc to the coast. • A site has been leased on ’Abbadan Island between Braim and Bawardeh, with a frontage on the Shatt-al- Arab, and a refinery will be erected here, and oil shipped from tanks into steamers for transport to England and elsewhere. The pipe-line from the Maidan Minaftun oil-field will pass near White Oil Springs, and here entering ’Arabistan will follow the Rarun past Wais, Ahwaz, and ’AlI-ibn-al-Hus dn. The total length will be about 130 miles, and the cost about £ 400,000. It is expected to be ready for use in 1912,MILITABY CONSIDERATIONS» CoMMtTjNICATXONS. Communications with the^ The case o! any army wishing to pass through S. ^Arabistan has already been dealt with in Part I (Bakhtiari GarmsTr), in which it has been assumed that the objective of the force would be the Bakhtiari hills, and that the Intervening country would be friendly. It was shown that the Karun offers the only reliable line of communication, and that a force of at least 5,000 men could be rapidly transported from Muhammareh to ISTasirl and thence to Shushtar.^ Also that the Buzleh-Ramuz route is practicable for small bodies . m autumn Ram Hormuz could be reached direct from Muhammareh by this route, but at other times the extent of the marshes of the Jam rahi would prevent the use of this route. Small boats could be used between Muhammareh and Khalfabad for baggage, the boats being man-handled for five or six yards over the dam at Darreh Kkazlneh* It may be further mentioned that the ports of Ilind an and Dllam afford a quick route from the sea to Behbehan, but other, considerations prevent these ports from being of much military importance for the actual landing of troops : for supplying troops at Behbehan, however, these two ports, particularly the latter, would be invaluable. Deh Mulla can be reached by lallams from Hindlan. The ports of Buzleh and Ma shur are similarly of little value for landing troops, but useful for supplying troops at Ramuz, if for any reason the Muhammareh-Nasm-Ramuz line is not available. Ma shur has no internal water communication, and the three stages intervening between ^ this port and Rainuz must be covered by pack mules, although it should be noted that a few days' work would make an excellent road for carts, the Jar- rahi R. ordinarily offering no obstacle. Buzleh has communi cation by water with Khalfabad, whence it is only two short stages to Ramuz. Communimtions along the coast.-Fvom Muhammareh to Bas rah and to the Gulf there is of course the Shatt-al- Arab, navi gable by all classes of boats : also the Bahmanshn, a tidal stream parallel to the Shatt-al-’Arab, and passable at all times by native craft. / 13 114 v ') ! ' Ballams drawing not over 2' sail regularly between Muliam- mareh and Fallahleh via the Marid-Fallahieh canal, covering the distance in about 12 hours. The ‘bar’ at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab once reached, and crossed, there is nothing to prevent any class of steamer proceeding to the open sea. Ocean-going steamers, however, desiring to land cargo at Bu- zieh or Ma’shur would find it advisable to effect the transhipment into native craft at Muhammareh. In order to land cargo at Hindian, ocean-going steamers would have to anchor at least 4 miles from the coast. Internal communications .—As has been mentioned before, 'Arab- istan is divided by three rivers, the Karim, Ja^rahT, and Hindian, running more or less N. and S. Within the ‘ doabs * thus formed there is nowhere any substantial obstacle to the passage of all arms in any direction, except close to the sea, and in the neigh bourhood of Fallah'eh, where canals and marshes would prevent the passage of wheels. Communications from W. toE. thus depend upon the exist ence of fords and ferries, which occur on the various rivers as follows :— River. Fords and bridges. Ferries. Remarks. Karan •. Gargar bridged at Shushtar: Shatait at Shushtar fordable in autumn. Band-i-Qlr, Muhammareh: Marid, Braicheh, Um- mut-Tamair, Na&amp;irl, and elsewhere. Jarrahi Cham-us-Sabi, ford Khalfabad, Makhsar, Fal- lahieh and elsewhere. Always au tumn only. Hindian •. .Zaidan ,. Deh Mulla, Hindian and elsewhere. l Biz •. Bridged at Dizful, ford nearXiit ’ Abd-ush-Sbah in autumn. Thus the only road running W. and E. south of the Nasiri- Ramuz-Behbehan hills, and passable for troops from Nasirl onwards without the aid of ferries is that immediately S. of, and parallel to, that range. Other tracks requiring the use of ferries run in every15 direction, as the map shows, but they are not visible on the ground, and are simply the tracks taken by ’Arabs across the flat barren desert between one place and another. Telegraphic Communications .—Persian Telegraph lines (single in every case) run from Muhammareh to NasirT, Shushtar and Diz- ful, and also from Nasirl via Ramuz and Behbehan to Borazjun con necting Nasiri with the Indo-European line from Bushire to Tehran and Europe via Isfahan. In this way Muhammareh and Nasirl are connected with India and England by wire via Borazjfm. From Eao a cable runs to Bushire, and land lines to Basrah and Baghdad en route to Europe. There is no communication between the Turk ish lines and Muhammareh, nor is there any telegraph office between Fao and Basrah. . Telegraph offices with operators (generally unable to send any language but Persian) exist at the above-mentioned towns, and at no others. Ahwaz only is officially open for messages in English. The state of the wire and apparatus is very bad. Practically no funds are allotted for the upkeep of wires and posts, and break downs are constant and prolonged during wet weather, and not infrequent in dry weather. The poles are from 6' to 10' in height, of wood, seldom straight, and often unfit to bear the weight of a single wire : no insulators : apparatus dirty and often ill-adjusted. Credit, however, must be given to the operators for working as well as they do, in view of the condition of the wire and apparatus. Telephone apparatus is provided at all stations, but is practi cally useless, as the state of insulation of the wire is so bad as to render it almost impossible to hear anything. The Indo-European Tel graph Department dedre to take over the’Arabistan Telegraph lines, and the question is (1909) under consideration by the Persian Government who are favour ably disposed to the idea. From a military point of view it may be noted that the ’Arab fully realizes the strategic value of the telegraph, and would not hesitate to cut it in order to hamper operations. Postal communications weekly by B. I.. S. N. Co.’s fast mail between Basrah, Muhammareh, Bushire, Masqat, Karachi and Bombay. Weekly also between all important Persian Gulf ports, Karachi, and Bombay by B. I. S. N. Co.’s slow mail (occasionally.) Bi-weekly by Persian post between Muhammareh, Nasirl, Shushtar and Dizful: also between Nasirl, Ramuz, and Behbehan. A Consulate courier usually runs weekly between Muhammareh and Nasirl in connection with the B. I. S. N. Co/s fast mail steamers.16 The Concession Syndicate, Ld., also have couriers funning between their camps and Nasirl. The Indian Post Office at Muhammareh is in the Consulate building. Letters posted at this office must in all cases be prepaid at foreign rates (except 0. H. M. S. covers, which go at Indian official Inland rates). This office is an Indian sub-office, transact ing M. 0. business, etc., as usual. Service labels are accepted ' on letters for India, etc. Communication by Military Signalling. S. Arabistan, being for the most part perfectly flat is ill-suited for military signalling over long distances. If, however, signalling platforms 10 ' high were erected, signals sent from them could ordinarily be read about 10 miles off by a man standing on the ground. The haze and mirage would greatly interfere with signals by day except in winter. Supplies. I. — S. ’Arabistdn. Generally speaking, S. 'Arabistan is capable of supplying a force of 10,000 men, with the same number of animals with food for an indefinite period. This statement must be supplemented by several important exceptions :— (1) Fallahleh and Ramuz are the main centres where _ food stuffs, barley, wheat and rice, are grown, but Muhammareh is also well supplied by river importations. Although there is generally an ample supply of wheat, there are practically no mills in S. 'Arabistan to grind it. There_ is a mill at Muhammareh capable of turning out 4 cwts. of flour daily, but it should not be relied on. There is a large number of mills at Shushtar (about 20), each capable of turning out about 2 cwts. daily. (2) Surplus wheat finds a ready market in normal years in Europe, and in winter and spring stocks held in the country are apt to run low. (3) The transport available in the country would be insuffi cient, even under favourable conditions, to enable foodstuffs to be accumulated at any spot without substantial assistance from military imported transport animals. (4) There being ample communication by river and sea, sup plies could be easily imported into 'Arabistan to make good any deficiency.17 (5) As fodder is at all times rather scarce in Muhammareh, and further is a very awkward load, great difficulty would be experienced in obtaining supplies for more than 500 animals. Pressed fodder, sufficient for 2 months’ requirements, should be brought from India and would probably have to be depended on. Sait is always available in all seaports. Afeai.—Sheep and goats are plentiful, but somewhat difficult to obtain in numbers without notice in large towns owing to the lack of grazing in the vicinity. Vegetables are very scarce indeed: must be imported from India or in smaller quantities from Basrah. In order to supply troops up tlie rivers, it will be noted that bedlams carrying 5 tons are available in large numbers in Muham mareh and FallahTeh, and could also be obtained from Basrah. They can be towed by hand as far as Deh Mulla from Hindian, and as far as Khalfabad from Muhammareh and from Buzleh. II. — N. ’Arabistdn. N. ’Arabistan could support about 20,000 men and animals, Shushtar, Dizfiil, and Ramuz being the main centres of supply. Fodder obtainable easily at the above towns. Salt .—From coast ports. Meat —As in S. 'Arabistan. Vegetables .—Plentiful in season at Dizful and Ramuz, and, to a less extent, at Shushtar. Transport. 'Arabistan is well supplied with communication by water, but cannot be reckoned to supply more than a very small number of camels, mules or donkeys. Ram Hormuz is a centre for muleteers and maybe expected (compulsion and sudden action being assumed) to produce 500 mules, Shushtar 1,000 mules and 100 horses, Dizful 1,000 mules and 500 horses. Muhammareh is not a centre for animal transport of any kind, but certain tribes of 'Arabs, particularly the Bawi, keep camels, and probably 1,000 suitable animals could be obtained if the authorities *at Muhammareh afforded assistance to the military : without such assistance it is improbable that any camels could be 6 I. B. c18 obtained is S. ’Arabistan. Fallahleh might, under favourable conditions, be relied on for 100 mules. Horse* are extensively used by ’Arabs, and probably 5,000 could be obtained under severe compulsion. The horses of ’Arab istan are not much to look at, and are not of the class that is exported to India, but are enduring, and pick up surprisingly when properly fed for a few weeks. It will be seen from the foregoing that an army proposing to operate would have to bring its own horses, and a large proportion, at all events, of its mules : in fact, it would be safer to rely on India for the whole animal transport required. Mules might be col lected after a delay of a month or so from Dizful, Shtishtar and Earn Hormuz, but this delay would probably be impracticable. For general use in ’Arabistan the mule is more suitable than the camel, as water and fodder can generally be obtained every day, whilst camel grazing is scarce. Climate. The climate of ’Arabistan is uniformly _ dry and bracing though irriga' ed tracts near the rivers are sometimes damp. In winter it is occasionally bitterly cold, but only for two or three days at a time : in January, the coldest month, the average daily maximum at Muhammareh is 57°, the minimum 45° ; the ex tremes met with during the month being 67° and 32°. As in winter, so in spring, the climate closely resembles that of the Punjab at the same period, and would not justify the issue to troops of any extra clothing. Eain usually falls between the 1st November and the 1st April, and the yearly average is about 11'. In summer, from April to October, there is no rain, and hot winds prevail. During July and August, the hottest months, the average maximum at Muham mareh is 103°, the average minimum 86°, with extremes of 110° and 84° respectively. The corresponding figures for Nasiri are somewhat higher owing to the greater dryness of the surrounding country. The average annual rainfall is greater at Nasiri than at Muhammareh, and at Shushtar and Dizful than at Nasiri. The minimum shelter for Indian troops compatible with health is an E. P. or S. S. tent. The extreme dryness of the air at Nasiri makes the heat there less irksome than at Muhammareh, in spite of the higher temperatures prevailing.19 &lt;R&gt; h In autumn the temperature falls, heavy mists and dew are the rule, and malarial fever becomes very prevalent. Military Capacities of Inhabitants. /.— S. ’Arabisfdn, # The military value of the Persian ’Arab, fighting under his own leaders in his own country, is undoubtedly less than that of his fellows on the Turkish side, and has probably decreased of late years. There is, however, little reliable information on the sub ject. They are mobile, whether on horse or foot, to a remark able degree, and are httle hampered by questions of supply. They are fairly well armed, though not by any means correspond ingly good shots, owing to lack of practice: the less well-armed Bakhtiari are better shots. When ’Arabs are fighting ’Arabs one side usually loses heart after a time, and retires, even though no decisive action may have been fought, or decisive range reached, or serious losses sustained. The side which can hold on longest, and keep together, wins the day. They are in fact generally faint-hearted and without con fidence in themselves or their leaders. Their democratic ten dencies make it impossible for any chief long to exact obedience from them unless they see it to be to their own advantage. To this cause may be partially attributed the fact that the Shaikh of Muhammareh has never been able to gain a decisive victory over his rebellious subjects W. of tue Karan. Arms and ammunition are extensively smuggled into ’Arabis- tan by sea from the Persian Gulf, and by land from Turkish Arabia, in spite of prohibitions. Only lack of money'prevents every ’Arab from being armed with a modern rifle. As things stand at pre sent, when serious military operations are contemplated by the Shaikh, he has to issue a large number of rifles and ammunition to the levies. In 1908, 5,000 rifles and a large number of rounds were lent by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait to the Shaikh of Muhammareh for use against the Bani Turuf, and it seems plain that without assistance the Shaikh could not have put more than 15,000 rifles into the field. The question of the number of ’Arabs that the Shaikh could put into and maintain on the field is of some importance. Under cer tain circumstances he would receive the assistance of tribes who, though on the Turkish side of the frontier, nevertheless look to the Shaikh as their tribal leader. These non-Persian adherents of the Shaikh could probably muster about 5,000 armed men. 0 220 The Muhaisin and Bam Turuf, and other tribes tributary to the Shaikh on the W. of the Kar un could probably muster at least 10 000 armed men if so inclined, but they would probably be a Lmce of weakness rather than strength to the Shaikh. The BanI Lam ’Arabs, and other tribes living W. of the Diz on the banks of the Shaur and Karkheh could also raise about the same number, but they have never fought under the Shaikh’s banner, and will probably never do so. The ’Arabs under the immediate and effective jurisdiction of ti e Shaikh, in addition to those mentioned above, could prob ably raise about 25,000 men, under some sort of control and more or less obedient to the Shaikh. If however, we take 30,000 men (including 15,000 mounted) as the’ maximum force that the Shaikh could put into the field in S ’Arabistan, we shall not be far below or above the mark. Such a force would be an ill-trained and ill-disciplined rabble, ill armed, faint-hearted, and with no stomach for a fight. Under the present regime, the probabilities of an invading army encountering serious resistance are very small. At the same time, however, a fairly efficient force could no doubt be trained by Europeans under favourable conditions. This question does not, however, fall within the scope of this book. Artillery.— The Shaikh has no serviceable guns, but 6 muzzle- loaders at Muhammareh are available for show purposes. H .— N.’Arabistan. Excluding the district of Ramuz, which, though properly speak- | ing part of ’ Arabistan, has been dealt with in Yol. I of this . Report (Bakhtiari Garmsh), and the ’Aqili district, which has been similarly dealt with, it remains to consider that part of Arab istan directly under the Governor, who usually resides at Shushtar: First come the nomad ’Arabs under the Governor of ’Arabistan but not formally under the j urisdiction of Shaikh Khaz al, though in practice they obey him in all external makers. These are (1) the Al Kathlr ’Arabs under Shaikh Haidar, liv ing near Shush and numbering 2,300 families. (2) The Bait Sa’ad, including the Cha’ ab-ud-Dibais under 1 Shaikh Farhan, living on either bank of the Diz, and numbering 4,000 families. (3) The BanI Lam, who are semi-independent and need not be considered. • The last mentioned are potential enemies of the Shaikh, who has long tried to bring them under his control, and, in the case of (L21 and (2), has been to some extent successful. Their military value is much the same as that of the Shaikh's followers (q.v. above). Next come the inhabitants of the town and district of Shush- tar: they are sedentary and unwarlike, though quarrelsome and fairly well armed. They could probably muster 2,000 men; all armed. Last come the inhabitants of Dizful and district. Nothing is more remarkable than the apathetic way in which Dizfulis, though well-armed, have allowed themselves to be rob bed and plundered by the Sagwand, their crops seized within a few miles of the town, and their cattle carried off from the very gates of the city, without making any attempt at reprisals. They have paid, and are still paying, heavy blackmail to the Sagwand, in order to purchase their consent to the lands W. of the Diz being cultivated, but this does not prevent the latter from making annual raids. Dizful and district could probably raise 4,000 armed men, but their moral would be of the lowest. The Sagwand and other Lurs camped W. of the Diz, nominal ly in 'Arabistan, will not be considered here but in Vol. Y of this report (Luristan). Medical. The main portion of the report by Dr. M. Y. Young, M.B.,m Yol. I of the report (Bakhtiari Garmsir) applies equally to ’Arabistan. In September and October, Mubammareb and tbe coastal districts are unbealthy, being very prevalent.’ Small-pox is practically endemic all the year round, few child ren escaping an attack. ^ Cholera is occasionally brought by travellers from Karbala or Baghdad, but there is no record of its ever having been brought fromShushtar or Dizful, though it has several times attacked those towns. Phthisis is not common,- but occurs with some frequency m towns. Syphilis is very common in all its forms. Bronchitis and Pneumonia are prevalent in February and March. Diarrhoea occasionally attacks new-comers, as the Karim water contains an appreciable quantity of Epsom salts. Plaque has never broken out in Muhammareh : the usual restric tions are in force, under the supervision of the Persian Quaran tine Service, represented at Muhammareh by a European Assistant Surgeon of the I.

Shilled Labour. —Shipbuilding fairly brisk, and 20 or 30 carpen ters regularly employed building ballams and with import ed wood Practically no other skdled labour available, quahty of local artificers , work is invariably poor. Language. —Arabic. Persian understood as a rule, but not Hindustani or English ; about 6 natives of India residen in Muham- Jnnreb and these might perhaps be of some use as interpreters. Suwlies —If country was favourably inclined to expedition 5 000 troops could be supplied without calling upon other than local resources, but it would be well to import flour mills, as those of Muhammareh are only sufficient for a small Proportion of the nor mal requirements: wheat is generally ground by hand by the women of the house. ' Meat obtainable in any quantity required, with notice. Rice plentiful. Vegetables are very scarce, and are at present imported to some extent from Basrah; B. I. S. N. Co. import potatoes. Limes and Lemons in large quantities in season from Dizful. Milk scarce; 100 milch cattle might be obtained: a little grazing for them in the date groves. Bisli plentiful. Grazing: a little in the date groves, but otherwise none near town except in spring for two months. Fodder .—A little lucerne (jest) in autumn, and a little grass or hay on sale in the town : bhusa normally scarce, unless immediately after abnormally good harvest, which rarely occurs. For over 50 animals special arrangements must be made locally, and for over 500 animals pressed fodder must be imported. Arabs feed their horses on the boiled root of the camel thorn, and graze donkeys and camels on camel thorn. Fuel —Coal about 100 tons in stock (Newcastle). This is required for the use of the river steamers, and could therefore not be made available for any other purpose. Date leaves form the25 principal fuel, and fair quantities of charcoal are available in the bazaar. Oil. —Standard Oil Company have a depot for petroleum in tins, but large stocks are not kept: large quantities no doubt available at Basrah. The Concession Syndicate will in a few years be able to provide at all events crude oil for fuel in any quantity.

At about miles there is a small village and a date plantation about one mile to the right. The going after rain is heavy and swampy. At 7 miles' Gisbah is reached, a small village of mud and straw huts, which is built on the left bank of a muddy creek about fifty yards wide and three feet deep. This is often difficult to ford. Provisions scarce. Water from the river. ’Arab Camp . . 30 General direction northerly. The road at 37 first is a mere track over the mud flat bordering the right bank of the Karun river; a scanty grass covers the plain, and affords grazing for some sheep. The country all around is swampy, and the track winds so as to avoid the swamps. From this point the cultivation of the date palm ceases and the country becomes entirely treeless. At about 7 miles is Rahvail, a tower on the right bank of the river. At about 14 miles there are a few patches of grass, but a little further on the country becomes absolutely barren. At about 19 miles there are depres sions which become ponds after heavy rain, and the ground is liable to become more or less flooded. At about 25 miles there are patches of good grass and a pond of sweet water. At 30 miles - the camping-ground is reached. Supplies nil. Water from the river. Firewood very scarce. ’Arab Camp 24 61 General direction northerly. The plain from here is more or less cultivated or covered with grass, and the Gul-i-Zard, a sweet smelling grass, is very plentiful. The country is not so liable to flood as hitherto. The road crosses a disused canal, and, at about 3 miles there is a good dry camping-ground close to a large pond of sweet water. Further on there are pasture lands near the river. At about 6 miles Sab’eh is passed where there are a few miserable huts and a clump of palm trees on the right bank of the river, which is here from 150 to 200 yards wide ; the banks are steep—of clay and sand—rising some four feet above the surface of the water. Tamarisk bushes grow freely here and aff jrd an abundance of fuel. Wheat and barley are cultivated along the banks of the river. A large proportion of the barley sown is cut green for fodder, and is allowed to reproduce itself year after year. The track follows the bank of the river. Drinking water is obtained from ponds or from the river. At 24 miles the camping-ground is reached, where there is good wheat and barley cultivation. Supplies might be collected from the tribes in small quantities. Water from the river. Grazing plentiful. No firewood. Ahwaz 21 82 General direction north-easterly. At 9 miles a small village of mud huts is passed. A little further on is the ferry of Umm-ut- , v Tamair. The river here is about 250 feet wido, and 18 feet deep, being deep close in to the bank. There is a small ferry boat capable of passing over about one ton of merchandise at a time. Horses and mules must swim across; the current is strong. Low bushes grow along the left bank. For the remainder of the distance the road lies along the left bank of the river over sandy going. One or two villages are passed ' at Bandar Amlnieh, opposite Bandar Nasiri below the Ahwaz rapids, is a ferry; the boat takes about 15 to 20 passengers.

Epitome—An extensively used route (particularly between Khalfabad and Ramuz) connecting Ramuz with the sea. Small boati ascend the Jarrahi to Khalfabad (34 m. from Ramuz), whilst sea-going baghalas from Bushire and the coast ascend the Khor Ma’shur to within 2 m. of Ma’shur* which is itself within 60 m. of Ramuz. The route is principally used during the summer and autumn, after the harvesting of tjie wheat and rice ; traffic at other times is small, though a certain amount of smug gling no doubt goes on along th s route. Plentiful throughout in good years, but after a bad season stocks of fodder would be low, and wheat anu barley scarce. The road is fit for wheels throughout, with slight improvements here and there* Special obstacles .—The Jarrahi is fordable at Khalfabad except after rec jnt rains; if unfordable there, it should be crossed near MakLsar boats being collected from Buz.eh and Fallahleh, where plenty are available in sizes up to 40 f. by 6 f. and drawing 3 feet.37 Route No. 5—contd.

The road leaves Behbehan in a north-west direction and runs down the centre of the Behbehan Valley and parallel to the Martin river for a distance of 6 miles, in the course of which the following villages are left on the rightKalin (3J miles from Behbehan, on the right bank of the Martin), Kharistan, Kurdistan and Husain- abad. Just before reaching Charasiab, 4 miles, the river changes direction due west and crosses the traveller’s front. The river is actually touched first at Las Bit (8 miles, no supplies except a few sheep), from which point the road traverses the left bank due west. About 1 farsakh (3^ miles) to the north from Las Bit, and lying in a semi-circular re entrant of the plain, at the foot of the hills, lie the villages of Dadunga and Kai Kaus, which would also be about 8 miles from Behbehan. The track leaves the bank of the stream from time to time and meanders through the belt of low hills and broken ground, which separates the Zaidan and Behbehan plains. 17 miles the wide reach of Cham Siah forms a convenient camp. There is a hamlet consisting of a few brushwood huts near the ford, the inhabitants being Agha Jari Lurs. Owing to the many changes in the course of the river hereabouts, the actual bed of the stream is in many places as broad as J a mile, but the stream now {i.e., in October) is only 40 yards broad and flows at the rate of about 2J miles per hour. The water is quite sweet and wholesome for consumption. In the dry season the nver can be easily forded in many places, but after rain would be generally impassable except at well-known fords, which would remain good owing to the hard, pebbly bottom.40 Route No. 10— concld. Gargar! 15 32 Deh Mitlla 54 General direction south-west. The Marun river is left immediately as it takes a sharp turn north-west at Cham Siah, while the Gargar! track follows a south-west course winding for 10 miles through the same belt of hills mentioned already as dividing the Behbehan and ZaidSn valleys. The track, although in many places leading over rocky cround presents no real difficulty to mule transport in fine weather, and is passable by infantry and cavalry, but not by artillery. At 10 miles the road descends sharply to the Hindian valley, which has here widened out to about 12 miles. The village of Gargari lies due south from the point of debouchment and is reached by a track passing over alluvial pasture land. A good view of the plain is obtained from the crest of the hill before descending. The river Hindian flows due west, 2| miles south of Gargari, and its bed here is about 1 mile broad. • 22 General direction south-west. Leaving Gargari (which includes 2 villages, viz., Upper and Lower Gargar!, both lying some , distance away from the river), the best way for a caravan is to avoid the river-bed and to keep to the usual track, which follows a general west direction at a distance of about 1 mile from the right bank of the river. At 5 miles the traveller is confronted by a plateau which at first sight is like an island, but on closer acquaintance proves to be the general level of the Jarrah! plain standing out against the lower level of the river-bed, which at this point takes an elliptical course south wards, passing the village of Ghula on the left bank, before resuming its original west course to Suvairek, where its direction alters finally to the southward. The caravan track keeps along a chord of the ellipse, as it were, to Suvaireh, and thence again follows the general course of the river to Deh Mulla, which is reached at 22 miles. Here there are some 3,000 inhabitants. Near the town the river is about 50 yards broad, and flows between steep banks ; in the autumn it appears to be fordable anywhere, the bottom being of firm mud. The supplies obtainable here are insignificant and transport animals few. A representative of the Shaikh of Muhammareh is located here. General direction south. The road traverses the Hindian plain, which is absolutely level; it follows the numerous bends of the river ( with a general southerly direction and Hindian is reached after passing numerous small hamlets and Bedouin encampments on either bank of the river. Hindian is a small town of about 1,000 inhabitants and is situated about 15 miles from the mouth of the river. Boats can, and do, ascend to the town, which is in 2 sections, one on each bank. The town is in the jurisdiction, and controlled by a local representative, of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. 4 i HindIan 21J 75J Route No. 11. AmInIeh to K 0 r Nahr Hashim. Epitome.

The Treaty of Erzeroum was signed on 31st May 1847 for the settlement of the Turko-Persian Boundary. Subsequent meetings of the Commission were held in 1849, 1850 and 1851 at Baghdad and Muhammareh. In 1851, Lord Palmerston stated that it was clear that no settlement would be come to except by an arbitrary decision on the part of Great Britain and Russia ; and he therefore proposed that the general line of frontier should be traced by the Agents of the Musul- man Powers at Constantinople, assisted by the Commissioners, in con formity with the stipulations of the Treaty of Erzeroum, leaving doubtful localities to be settled in detail in future. The Russian Government agreed to this proposal and the work of surveying the country from Mount Ararat to the Persian Gulf was then commenced. When this was done the preparation of a map of the Turko-Persian Frontier, embracing a territory, 700 miles in length and from 20 to 40 miles broad was put in hand, and this work lasted from November 1857 till March 1865, when the Porte was in formed in May of that year, that, ‘ in the opinion of the Mediating Powers, the future line of boundary between the respective dominions of the Sultan and the Shah was to be found within the limits traced on the map, that the two Muhammadan Governments should themselves mark out the line, and that in the event of any differences arising between them in regard to any particular locality, the points in dispute should be referred to the decision of the Governments of England and Russia.” This boundary has remained unsettled down to the present time, and disputes have frequently arisen be tween the Turkish and Persian Governments respecting their respective claims to land in the Pusht-i-Kuh district, known by the Turks as the Saiyid Hassan Lands, and by the Persians as Bagh-i-Saleh and Ghoraibah. These districts in clude a portion of the Saifi and Malkhatari Lands. In 1873 an Agreement, which had been entered into between the two Powers two or three years pre viously, was renewed, by which it was agreed that Ghoraibah and Bagh-i-Saleh should remain intact and should not be interfered with on either side, and that neither side should claim or institute any right of possession by cultiva tion or otherwise, until the Commission appointed has expressed its opinion. From Hertslet’s &lt;c Persian Treaties,” 1891. A temporary Boundary Agreement between Persia and Turkey was signed on 3rd August 1869. (See Appendix III.) In September 1869, a copy of this “ Identic map n was officially communicated to the Turkish and Persian Governments respectively, but no boundary was marked on( 57 ) APPENDIX V. Temporary Boundary Agreement {Protocol) between Turkey and Persia dated ?&gt;rd August 1869. Abstract Translation .— This agreement is drawn up with a view to the maintenance of the status quo. 1. The two parties will use every exertion towards increasing the security of their respective frontiers. 2. The status quo respecting disputed lands, such as was defined by the Commissioners of the four Powers is to continue in force until the Boundary Line is settled. 3. Every place which was considered disputed land when the status quo was accepted by the parties shall remain under the authority of the State which governed it at that time, until the boundary is settled. But this supervision will not confer the right of ultimate possession. 4. On these disputed lands no buildings shall henceforth be erected by either party, and no existing buildings or marks shall be considered proofs of possession when the boundary line is fixed. 5.
