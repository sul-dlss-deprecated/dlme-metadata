B. 247. BRITISH INTERESTS IN ARABIA. It is understood that a memorandurn is desired, explaining why the •exclusion of Italy from Western and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea littoral is important in British interests. 1. The importance of Arabia from its geographical position, lying along two of tUe main approaches to India, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is a commonplace. ISio part of the country can be completely indifferent to Great Britain, who is the only Power that at present has a foothold in the country. Our hold is limited to a narrow fringe along the coast, from Aden to Koweit; its security depends ultimately upon the tranquillity of the interior. Since we are unable to intervene in, or control, the interior, it is essential to exclude all possible seeds of disturbance. 2. Arabia is not a State in any effective sense, but a fortuitous concourse of tribes—more or less settled in the fertile regions near the coast, elsewhere wandering—under Chiefs, the limits of whose sway are determined, not by frontiers, but by the tribes which they for the time being control. Their politics are closely interwoven, and a quarrel may run light across the continent. With the tribes and Chiefs along the coast mentioned we have treaty relations. 3. In addition to this we occupy at Aden an area of 75 square miles with a considerable hinterland, the frontier of which, with the Yemen, has been demarcated. The Chiefs within this frontier are under our protec torate. 4. The strategical importance of Aden need not be emphasised. The fortress of Aden is almost impregnable against tribal forces. In circum stances as they existed before the war we could hold it with a very small force, and control the protectorate by means of prestige and subsidies. 5. The Aden-Yemen frontier is a frontier quoad the Turks, not quoad the Arabs, who do not greatly respect it. Its demarcation was necessitated largely by the intrigues of our semi-independent neighbour the Imam of Sanaa, whom the Turks encouraged when it served their purpose, but could never effectively control when he chose to defy them. But we had recognised Turkish authority, and whenever some petty local incident occurred the only remedy was representations at Constantinople. The Imam has pretty extensive claims on our side of the frontier—indeed, they extend to the Hadramaut tribes on the coast the other side of the protectorate. To the north and north-east, where the frontier has not been demarcated, we are safeguarded by the great desert, the Ruba al Khali, and by our treaty relations with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, which, however, suffice only so long as the tribes of the Hadramaut hinterland are not tampered with. ' 0. In addition to being a fortress, Aden is the gateway of a considerable land trade with the Yemen (worth before the war about 300,000i. per annum). The construction of a railway from Aden to Taiz—desirable for political reasons as well—would make Aden the main outlet for the trade of the Yemen. If another Power is master of the Yemen, it will build a line from Hodeida to Sanaa ; Hodeida will become the outlet, and Aden will lose the trade it already possesses. 7. It is the Yemen on which Italian ambitions are mainly fixed. The Yemen is as little a unity as Arabia itself, and when the Turk is ejected from Arabia it will fall to no one Arab master. The Idrisi, we know, will claim S 358o Li down to and including iloiliMi'la, the Imam of Sanaa will claim the greater part of the remainder, and there are certain Sheikhs (like Mavia) on our border whom it will be to our interest to maintain independent. We have by treaty guaranteed the independence of the Idrisi in bis own domain (undefined), and undertaken to arbitrate between him and the Imam where their claims clash. The Idrisi and the Imam are possibly irreconcilable adversaries, though the removal of the Turk may bring them closer together. S. The Italo-Turkish war made Italy the most unpopular of the Christian Powers in the Moslem world. This unpopularity is enhanced by Italian methods of colonial administration, and by national characteristics— in particular by Italian treatment of the women of subject races, a point on which Moslem opinion is very sensitive. Moreover, the Iman has an especial ground for detestation in that Italy blockaded his coast, and supported the Idrisi with arms and money during the war. 9. From the preceding description of the general political conditions it must be clear that the appearance of Italy in the Yemen would create in Western and Southern Arabia a ferment which would not be limited to that region, and from which we, as the limitrophe Power, would be the chief sufferers. Our consent to it would be resented by the Grand Shereef and by the Arabs as a breach of faith towards the so-called Arab State, and it is probable that this resentment would be shared by the whole Moslem world (including India) who would consider that, after having betrayed the Turk, we were now betraying the Arab. This would react unfavourably on our position at Aden, and our reputation as a Power friendly to Islam. The Arabs have made use of our support against the Turks, but they do not like us any the more ; and when the Turkish danger is removed it is by no means certain that the brunt of their dislike will not in any case fall on us, and with redoubled force if it is thought that we have released them from the Turk (who is at least a Moslem) only to hand them over to the most hated of Christian nations. If the Idrisi, in virtue of his former connection, welcomes the Italians, it is certain that the Imam will oppose them. That will mean hostilities on our border, ending at the best in a precarious peace, seeing that the Italians will be far too exhausted to undertake decisive operations in the hills. With our experience of Italian relations with the Senussi in Cyrenaica, and of the resultant friction with Egypt, we may know what to look for in Aden, and we may expect before very long to be ourselves involved in hostilities on, if not within, our own border. If, on the other hand, the Imam accepts Italian domination, it must be expected that part of the price he will ask will be the support (at least tacit) of his claims where they will not conflict with Italy's, i.e., in our protectorate and in the Hadramaut; and against his intrigues we shall have no redress but appeals to Rome, which are likely to be even less fruitful than were appeals to Constantinople. If these anticipations are well founded, it is clear that our position in Aden will have to be put on an entirely different footing. Instead of keeping a handful of troops in the fortress and exercising a weak control over the tribes by subsidies, we shall have to hold the Protectorate in force—and this is surely not a prospect which His Majesty's Government can regard with equanimity. 10. The present war has shown the use that may be made against us of Islam. Arabia is of great importance in the Islamic world, not only as the cradle of Islam and the seat of the Holy Places, but also because its geographical position interposes it as a wedge between the Islam of Africa and that of India and the surrounding countries. 11. The ultimate success of the policy of His Majesty's Government in the Middle East depends to a large extent on the transfer of the Caliphate from Turkey to Arabia. This in turn depends upon the possibility ofr 3 making the ruler of the Hejaz sufficiently strong to be able to pose as an independent sovereign. This again depends upon keeping the Christian Powers at a sufficient distance. But an Italian occupation of the \einen would—from the relations in which the two regions stand to one another— make Jta^ the mistress of the Hejaz. ' If Al Yemen goes, Islam is gone,' an Arab Saiyid said to Colonel Jacob as long ago as 1912. These are some of the reasons for which we took the precaution of providing in the Anglo-French Convention that ' the British and French ' Governments agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not ' consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian ' peninsula.' For the present purpose a sphere of influence is equivalent to territorial possession. A.

Its purpose is to explain 'why the exclusion of Italy from Western and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea littoral is important in British interests'. It notes the importance of Arabia lying as it does along two of the main approaches to India from Europe. Hirtzel's memorandum also notes the absence of an effective state in Arabia, and the concomitant influence of tribes and their chiefs.It reviews the strategic importance of Aden and its protectorate along with the significance of the Aden-Yemen frontier in the context of British relations with the Imam of Sanaa and Turkey (paragraphs 4-5). It notes that the Italian ambitions are mainly focused on the Yemen and that the Italo-Turkish war made Italy the most unpopular 'Christian power' in the Muslim world. It analyses the implications of any British consent to an Italian occupation of the Yemen.It concludes that the 'present war has shown the use that may be made against us of Islam' and contends that the success of H M Government in the Middle East 'depends to a large extent on the transfer of the Caliphate from Turkey to Arabia. This in turn depends on the possibility of making the ruler of the Hejaz sufficiently strong to be able to pose as an independent sovereign. This again depends upon keeping the Christian powers at a sufficient distance.' The memorandum finishes by noting that it was for these reasons Britain took the precaution of inserting in the Anglo-French convention [Sykes-Picot agreement] that the British and French Governments agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian peninsula with a sphere of influence being seen as equivalent to territorial possession.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Italy</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sykes-Picot agreement (1916)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00028a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
