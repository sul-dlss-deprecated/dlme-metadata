B . KS political Agent Bahrein Sir, * We the undersigned merchants 'beg to lay the following few lines v.'ith a request that your honojr will pleased to consider them favourably:- That the current rate of landing charges of some merchandise is a'bnormally high. This comes in our way in sending for these goods.As the vj^le margin of profit goes to the shippimg Agents who enjoy the profit from the Landir^ charges at our cost and indirectly some day may have the ? mano poly to trade to themcelve s Specially the followin/articles among others are 'being heavily charged. Lanterns per case of (1 dozen) Cement per cask Cement perl 00 'bags of 1 cwt Loaf sugar per 1 00 'bags of 1 cwt IDIron wires per cwt n h Vermicelli per case of 3° ''Tea per case Iron 'bars per cwt Sugar per 100 'bags 1 \ cwt pineapples per case Ropes per 'bundle however small Tin per slat RS .

It may not 'be out of place to mention that when ever extra lighters are engaged 'by the Agents of the shipping companies those lighters are paid in very small sums for the same.It would oe apperent that the shipping Agents would 'bring in these articles and even on diff erence of Landing charges they can mak$ a good profit xor themselves in comparision with other merchants.Tha^tf*the Landing charges oe fixeu 111 consideration of the present circums^Lces of labour in this port and the Agents may not charge more than wha^they have actually paid.How a days Q labour in this port in all respects is much cheaper. ( That the coolie charges taken by the Import yard are in for excess ■ \\a?, taose paia by the merchants for removing the same goods to their gaCowns the present rates of coolie charges are based on war time rates wne^ll tne necessaries of ^ were dear and now those circumstances have J entirely changed and the labour 1 is very cheap and the charges be altered according to rates of labour in town. In addition to that the import yard anthorities actually charge as double than what they actually pay to the coolies for removing the gooas to the new shedon the pier.The Import yard is a medium ot collec- ting the charges and distributing to the coolies but is not expected to make profit by this way.Hence the matter be kindly inquired into and that ; . e merchants be charged actually whatever the coolie charged may have been pai^b;- the Import yard as is done in case of old shed and that extra , charges collected by th» merchants be refunded to them. That the scale of coolie charges be altered in consideration of the rates of labour in town and that tha charges for the new shed be than those of the old shed.That in certain articles the charges have been abno_mally high which ought to be reasanably decreased. However if we are allowed an interview/ we shall place all the facts with details.

B. m 1 s Consul &amp; Political Agent, *k h h s in* •/ N -2^ hi*. h6r8i^^ M dear sir, We acknowledge receipt of your letter No* 165 of 4th instant informing us that certain Hindu and Persian Merchants have complained to you and lodged serious accusations as to the condition and wor&amp;Lt^ of the Lighterage Coy* s boats. In reply we would at the outset emphatically repudiate the allegations which are groundless and without foundation and simply the outcome of grierance caused by the unfortunate damage to cax^o ex the &amp;• S. 9 Bandra * Voy.145 from stress of weather* In answer to the strictures enumerated in your letter under reply we would advise 1. Although the majority of the Company* s boats are some years old they are in thoroughly staunch and seaworthy condition having always been periodically surveyed and overhauled, as a matter of fact the boats were thoroughly reconditioned only a few months ago . at the cost of Rs.3,287/-.* &lt; j i h&amp;j /y &gt; V * 2. The allegation that our boats are overlaaded in order to ensure quick despatch to steamers is without found ation as can be proved by Boat Notes. Our staff have strict instructions to see there is no overloading./3 2 oTtrloadlng, and as the srews art not paid dn the cargo carried, but at monthly wages there is no incentive for them to oyerload their boats, infact their aim is usually the opposite* All our boats in:e supplied with tarpaulins and which are used for the protection of ea2vo 9 but tarpaulins eannot prevent damage from the lap of the waves which is hew most damage occurs. Discharge from steaoers is not carried on during rain or when the weather is considered too stormy for safe working and both the ship* s and our staffs have defin ite instructions on this point. In an open roadstead such as the Bahrein anchorage which is expowed'to the Shumal wind there is always the risk of damage occulting and which cannot be avoided when cargo is discbaxged into open boats which are the type used at this, and all Gulf Ports and Insurance Companies recogniee/taccept the risk. We are unware of what rules regarding use of the ' Defective Oodown ' and which have led to an increase in loss in weight of sugar are referred to and would be glad to have further information on the point when we will immediately take steps to rectify the matter if it is possible. In this connection however we would mention that the ' Defective Go down ' which is used for the storage of caxgo for which the Customs refuse to pass a clean receipt has been found to be an unsatisfactory method from our point of view, and we have arranged with the Customs to do away the system as far as we are concerned end receipt for all cax^o as it is delivered to themCWighmsnt or opening and counting the contents of outwardly defective packages as necvssary. c Damage^ packages likely to cause damage to sound ones are always separated on dischazge from Lighter and not mixed with the sound packages as alleged. We take this opportunity of requesting you to be good enough to look into the whole question of the receiving of cax^o by the Customs as we consider the present method very unsatisfactory from our point of view. At present the average caxgo remains on the pier as lox^ as 3 days before being taken in chaxge by the Customs or even a landing check been taken, which we feel sure you will agree is unsatisfactory.We have in the past frequently pointed the delay in the Customs taking over eai^o and requested that a landing tally should be taken, but this has never been arranged as it was hoped that the Trolly system would expedite work and do away with any delay in the taking over and removal of cargo from the pier. This however has not proved the ease as it has has been found after several months trial that although a considerable improvement has been effected the trolly system cannot move the cazgo as quickly as it can be discharged from boats and the pier kept clear. May we suggest that you arrax^e a meeting with the Adviser and the Director of Customs to diseuss the whole question of the reeeivir^ of eaxgo and arrar^e a more satisfactory system than at present in force. We are. Bear Sirs, Yours faithfully. tiEsaiQ+A tu .j -s- * - Agents. 1. S«^- ERD. lr . I VI- \ x j ' // [('j I *^1 /. A ' 7^ A. Ir I. t.L..

They, it appears, failed to do so, and only succeeded in proving some claims for goods short delivered fnlease see at slip C to L). There is nothing orr record to show how these claims were finally settled. However the 'ajlis in one of their reports state that some cargo was landed in damaged condition from steamers as borne out by the boat notes and was damaged by rains on pier but they could no* say what quantity was damaged by rain on pier and the amount damaged while bringing ashore, /'slip k ). From this it appears that during the uetiod Landing Contractor and Agents were appointed by Shaikh Isa such claica were nlether recognised nor paid. Neither Shaikh laa nor his Local Agents accepted responsibility and saidrain xax which caused damage was the hand of Cod. But a 5 nee the construction of C us tons Anara and a+'ter the Landing Contract was taken up by Messrs Gray Paul &amp; Go (Now I/iessrs Vespers) there had been a case of damages against Messrs Gray Paul *■ Co in 1P16. This I ^ave found out from Vernacular records (old) and submit herewith, Although Messrs Gray Paul *- Go has disclaimed all responsibility for damage while bringing the goods ashore in terms of their agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrein, clauses 11 ^ 14, they were held responsible and a decree for Rs.rspsi/- was passed, for 58 damaged bags of rice by Major Fowle. But when yajor Loch came in as Political Agent, the order was reversed and the claimants vrere given the sale proceeds of damaged goods^certificates for the damaged bags to enable the claimants to recover the balance from their respective T nsurance Companies. For Agreement IP 14 please see at slip Y and for new one of 1^24 at slip Z, The following points in connection with (l) Landing c omm e n t e d up on Charges and fp) Hamali rates as axxxxMXxxjcaci by the Adviser ^ Bahrein State are also submitted for your knowledge:- (a) Over 00^ of the steamers cargo is l&amp;v~ied by ?/essrg Lfesrers # conference merchants (b) The rates were settled at a »3C®5KaxiK3?R of v, eld been in 1014, since then certain modifications have 7 made ^i ,e. increases^.

(c)The Landing Company handles cargo at the steamer, brings it ashore, lands it and is responsible for it until taken over by the Import Yard. fd) The Landinr* Company provides a fleet oi 4 10 lirrhters with crew and supervisors maintained throughout the year at considerable expense.

The Corp any is a reoogniaecl and reliable institution. fe) Previously no lighters 7;ore maintained by the Contractors but old ones were hired only temporarily for the occasion to land carp-os and no lighters, crew or supervisers -were maintained permanently. The landing charges now repr' sent the coat of keep- -inp'. up the Lnadlnr Company. The merchants have been relieved of much inconvenience and difficulty of landing their cargo, fa) The coolie hire in time, may probably be leas but the Hamali ra^.es charged in the customs include the coolie-hire for carry- -inr the cargo from the Pier to the Import Yard, prompt removal, sort in p - and stacking for prompt and ready delivery to the merchant^. No extra charge for these extra servicea is made contrary to the custom of other Customs Authorities elsewhere. If owing to the fall of coolie hire the rate ia to be reduced then the extra fee ^-or sorting is necessary to manitain extra staff for sorting the packages. fb) The Bahrein Government advanced large sums of money for constructing trolly system/ and Pier Shed.GOVSRiJMENT 0? BAHRAIU Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, 4th Ramzaan, 1345. rrf To The H. B. M' s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, V/ith reference to the petition frorn c ertain merchants on the siihjects of 1. Landing charges, 2. Hamaly rates, forwarded for comments; I have the honour to make the following remarks.- T Vith reference to 1. Over 90^ of the steamer cargo is landed 'by Mesper's subsiduary landing company, who are therefore chiefly affected by the petition. Kates wer^ settled at a conference held in 1914, since then certain modifications have 'been made. Hates relate to the kind of article handled not to its market value. The petitioners do not appear to appreciate this. The Landing Company handles cargo at the steamer, brings it ashore, lands it,and is responsible for it^until taken over by the Import Yard. The Landing Company provides a fleet of 10 Booms, with crews and supervisors, which are maintained throughout the year at considerable erpense. Although coolie labour is now cheaper than during the war, shipwrights and carpenters are very expensive. The Landing Company lands cargo promptly and is a recognised and reliable institution. It is unreasonable to compare the costs of hiring an odd lighter to land cargo with the permanent charges made by the landing Company. The landing charges represent the cost of keeping ui the landing Company; whose agreement with the Government of Bahrain extends until 1929. It is well known that before the institution of the Landing Company cargo was landed with great dif ficulty and with much inconvenience to the merchants themselves.I do not consider that this demand for a revision of the rates is Justified. Mth reference to 2.- The rates charged 'or Hamaly were based on the distance that the goods were carried. As the pier was lengthened the charges increased in proportion. It is possible that coolie rates in the town are less than Import Yard hamaly rates but the petitioners forget that the cargo is not only carried from the pier to Import Yard, but is Ported, promptly remosr od andstacked, so that when the importer takes his cargo from the shed he finds it ready and prepared for him. No charge is made for this, contrary to the custom of other custom authorities elsewhere. Hence when the importer removes his own import, already sorted for him and carries it to his own godown, a short distance away, it is possible that his coolie charges may appear lower in comparison to those of the import yard. The Government is prepared to consider a reduction in hamaly charges but if this were done extra staff would have to be taken on to carry out, at least, the sorting^and a fee would be charged to the importer for this. The result would be the same. Regarding hamaly for the pier shed; The Government advanced a large sum of money to pay for the trolley system and Pier shed. In view of the shorter'distance over which cargo is carried the payment to the tindal was reduced. The money thus saved is beingtreated as a refund to the Government on account of the a dvance. When this capital expenditure has been refunded the Pier shed will be used for R. E. cargo only, paying the tindal half the porterage and charging the reexporter at the same rate. Possibly the petiti oners e re not aware that the Impoit Yard is faced in the near future with heavy expenditure. The whole roof will have to be rebuilt, two go-downs need enlarging and the piershed requires entirely repainting, this can only be carried out by a heavy advance from the Government and it is reasonable for the Government to expect to recover such expenditure, over a period of time, from the various charges made in connection # with the hamaly and other fees. I do not think that the petitioners have real grounds for asserting that the charges in both,l &amp; 2, are unfairly high, but they naturally desire a reduction so that their own profits may increase. I have the honour to be, &lt;2.

From this it appears that during the T&gt;etiod Landing Contractor and Agents were appointed by Shaikh Isa such claims were niether recognised nor paid.

In my opinion, the agreement is a privileged dooioment, nnd would only 'be made puhlio with the oonourrence of the parties oonoerned. I have approached Merspers on the subject and find that they are not in favour of publication. This being so, I do not consider that tl^e Government should issue a copy of the agreement. The .landing company is a commercial under taking, not a free Public Utility Institution depending on public subscriptions. If it came under the latter category the public would certainly have a right to scrutinise its documents, agreements, accounts etc. Persons are not compelled to make use of it and it has no monopoly that precludes any similar undertakings. I am confident that the leading Bahrain merchants feel satisfied that the Government is at all times anxious to protect their interests, and will do so if real grounds for complaint against the Landing Company pre disclosed, but I repeat that I do not consider that the document in nuestion is a public one, and the precedent which would be formed by publishing it^would^to mj mind^be an exceedingly dangerous one w Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.No. of 1027.

With reference to your dated 16th May 1927, I have the honour to forward a copy of my letter to Mespers on this subject. From the statements of the complainants it appears that the Landing Company failed to carry out certain conditions which are laid down in their agreement;. 1. No tarpaulins were used to cover the cargo. 2. Goods were unloaded during 'bad v /eather which lasted at least two days. 3. The lighters were leaking and overloaded. The complainants state that they can prove the ahovg statements by evidence given on oath, in which case the Landing Company are responsible for compensating the complainants for the damage incurred through their negligence. As Mr. Spence, I believe, is leaving Bahrain for Basrah by the next boat and the Director of Customs is shortly after going on leave, I suggest that the matter is an urgent one and should be settled as soon as possible, I therefore request that if the Landing Company deny the allegations of the complainants, that you will hold an enquiry at which it may be decided whether the Landing Company are responsible or not.

The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation of whioh an extract was forwarded to me in your No. 201 of '27 dated 11th Mar oh 1927, I have the honour to make the following remarks. The published agreement 'between the Government of Bahrain and various steamers 1 agents states in clause 7:- 'That the Superintendent of the warehouse will receive the cargo from the agents of the shipping companies on the land either on the Pier or on the Warehouse wharf and will pass a receipt for the stuff received' Accordingly, an acknowledgment is given 'by the Import warehouse at the time of taking over the cargo lying on the Pier, after it is landed, and this is followed 'by a formal receipt. The question then arises: In whom lies the responsibility for the cargo after it is landed, and until it is taken over by the Import warehouse? This has been In dispute for several years, and it is, in fact, the point involved in Mespers' letter under replyreply, though veiled under the suggestion of a 'landing oheoi'. I oonstrue the clause (rightly, I 'believe) that the agents -vho land the cargo are responsible for it until the Import warehouse takes it into ohar^e. Sinoe the existing agreement -vas accepted by I'espers until the year 1929, with an option to renew for five years, this is not an appropriate time to attempt to change its stipulations. Since it is an advantage to the agents to land the cargo they might be expected to undertake some responsibility for it. In regard to the practical working of the t agreement, it might be observed:- The steamer's agent is primarily concerned v/ith the speedy handling of the cargo, so that his ship may be promptly despatched; consenuently work is carried on by day and by night. Since it is undesirable to work at night, owing to the risk of pilferage, the Import warehouse only works by day; and since it cannot take into charge any c-^rgo until such has been landed, it follows that part of the cargo must be landed before the removal can commence, JL * and the removal must be finished some few hours after the remainder of the cargo is landed, both jobs proceeding concurrently, Then cargo is landed after sunset, the removal begins the first thing on the next morning, and continues by day until all the cargo is removed.An average steamer's o?rgo work, i.e., * 1. the disoharge E. landing 3. removal can nuite possibly extend over three days, which is WyMi reasonable. Hence the statement that an 'average cargo remains on the pier as long as three ^ 'days 'before being taken in charge 'by the Customs' ^is incorrect as proved 'by statistics. Since it may 'be the Landing Company's 'business to make a landing check, it- necessary, and not the Customs' I suggest that this point does not arise. The trolley system works steadily and well, and is fully adequate to an average cargo, there 'being no necessity in this port for excessive speed in either landing or removing cargo. I A rice steamer's cargo is abnormal: and, although the rate of remov o l is then considerably accelerated, it is imnossible to take into charge more than the warehouse will contain. It is impossible with the present staff to remove cargo at night; were this done a number of extra clerks and watchmen would be required and the hamaly charges would have to be raised to cover additional expense which would undoubtedly be extremely unpopular among the Importers. I have proposed to Shaikh Hamad and obtained his approval for the building of a wall right across the entrance of the main pier reaching to the new mole which will have one or two gates in it so that the customs pier will no longer be a public promenade and this I am sure will check the pilfering which is said■cage -4- said to ooour while oargo lies on the pier. If the Bahrain State renews the agreement with the landing oorapany In 1929 the question would ♦ naturally be fully discussed 'but I do not consider that It Is advisable at present to alter the terms sg the working of the agreement. In matters of this description the government should be consistent. The Indian merchants and some others lately petitioned to you for a reduction in the landing charges on a number of commodities. They are now organising another petition on this subject and on other matters regarding the landing company. In my reioly to you, Ho. 711/9A of the 4th Ramzaan T 45 f I suggested that the landing charges as laid down in the agreement Should not be reduced until the expiration of the agreement in 1929, if the landing company themselves now ask for changes to be made in the working of the agreement the government would not be justified in refusing a general revision of the terms and charges of the company which in my Opinion, and I am quite sure, in the opinion of Mr. Spence, is not at present justifiable. I beg to enclose a report from the Director of Customs regarding unloading of a recent cargo for your information. I apologise for so lengthy a letter but I hope that I have explained the ■position. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Obedient Servant, AAHlSEd •|J A.H, R E L N r A T ' ,G0V3H^iE!TT 0? BAERAII No. of 1345 Office of the Adviser to the GovGrrment, Bahrain. Dated 14th Ihul Ha j,1345 To The H. 3. M 1 s Political Agent, BAHRAIII. Sir, With reference to your Memo Ho. 419 of 20th May 1927 regarding petition from Messrs. Uaralndas Kuljimal &amp; Go. I have carefully enquired into this matter. In my opinion there is some cause for complaint, although the complainants are not justified in all their statements. It was decided that all rice should pass the municipal examination. R.S.ricc was Included in order to injure a uniform weight and to prevent any shortage which would reflect 'badly on the name generally of Bahrain exporters. This in my opinion is cnaite reasonable. There was never any t^l\ about these orders 'being issued 'by the British Government and I am at a loss to understand what actually the petitioners mean 'b:/ this reference. Regarding the second weighing of the rice ex s.s.'Bankura', Voy. 158. This rice was passed 'by the authorities, the only stipulation 'being that the Importers should make up the shortweight. The petitioners requested that the Hangoon rice should 'be weighed again 'by the board which was appointed by the Baladia. It appears that the board refused to weigh thepage _ Q _ the rice again, this refusal was entirely wrong. It has nov been deaidei that rice imported under a oertifioate from the Indian of Oommeroe, even though short'/eighC4&gt; will not be liable for a fine. The importers will be however expeoted to make up any shortage. The orders as to the weighing of rise was passed by T I. E. Shaikh Hamad on application by the Municipal council and are indeed for the protection of local and foreign purchasers of rice imported into Bahrain. If the petitioners have had to pay an additional period of Xhanchle owing to the refusal of the board to re-veigh the Hangoon Rice, the Government are prepared to re und to them this amount. I have spoken to the Secretary of the Baladia and informed him that in future rice must be weighed ag^in if the importers asked for re-weighing. I beg to remain, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. V I &gt;A Ho. tTd t-f of 1927 - Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the ^ 6 June 1927.

Wow to settle with the present consignment, 1 have told then that they nust arrange to brin&lt;r the consignment ■ i up to its correct weight before removing it from the Customs, so could you have it re-weighed, if any are short weight, which they probably will be now after two months drying in the Customs, they will bring them up to weight. I have informed them that extra khanchic will be refunded to then, also i think they should not be charged on the R.E rice which comprises half the consignment although it has been delayed 20 days here. ; Captain, Political Af?ent, Bahrain. m'7 /6, 'p &amp; 8/ fs )s//rr/// . 9th May, 1926. //S s • 0 *' ' l^ol /u-iS ^ R, B.

In continuation of our previous petitions we, the undersigned merchants,beg to bring to your kind notice that the present scale of landing charges is very high and specially in sorae articles the charges are exceptionally high;as the period of the press nt contract is shortly to expire, we respectfully submit,that before the new contract is given the charges may be reasonably reduced as to the trade of this port may be able to bear;as this port is chiefly dependant on outside-purchasers and only a limited percentage of the total arrivals is consumed locally and this port has to face the compe tition of other gulf ports. Further the landing charges in certain articles are abnormally high which have indirectly given the monopoly to the shipping agents to deal in them.In this connection,we submit that such charges may be fixed so that all the merchants may have the equal freedom of trade and not that few individuals may enjoy at the cost of all the merchants. We bring to Your honor's attention that the present scale of landing charges requires a thorough revision from the present point of view of trade hence we shall feel highly obliged if merchants are consulted before the new scale is sanctioned and the terms of the landing contract should be more clear so as to avoid any untowardness between the Landing contractors and the merchants. l /V V jffith due respects.

(3) That the boats which have been surveyed and whose carrying capacity has been fixed should only be permitted to land the cargo except in special cases.

(5) That defective piece goods cargo should not be opened on steamers but should be sealed and opened on the pier in the presence of the Custom's officer to avoid possiblity of pilferage there-in.

The Government of Bahrain v.ishes at all times to protect the interests of the merchants but I consider that lately the merchrnts have be come somewhat arrogant in their demands. The petitioners seem to forget that any decision regarding the Landing Company or the tariff will be made by the Government, not by a group of foreign merchants. With reference to the petition. Para 1. A clause is being inserted in the Landing Company's Contract to this effect. Para 2. I do not consider that this can be done. 1 .Jkc' .v^ Para 3. iixtra boats are only employed at present in special cases, i.e., when there is an abnormally large cargo. ^ N CA■ IB i elPara 4. This will be considered, t* •, / para 5. The Landing Company accepts all responsibility for any losses between the ship ^ A P I m U a &lt; Cw «rid the shore. Para 6.

The Government is not considering cancelling its agreements with the present Landing Companies bjit is revising the tariff and the clauses of the agreements. para 7. The Government, not ieeai several local merchants, v .ill decide what reduc tion will be made and whom it considers most suitable to take on the agreement.

Shaikh Haraed bin Isa Al- Khalifa, C. S. I., The Deputy Ruler of B&amp;hrain, on behalf of the Government of Bahrain. Whereas on the Twentythird day of June, 1928, a license was granted to the Agents to land cargo on the Customs Her at Manaaah, and to deliver such cargo to the Director of Customs, upon the terms therein mentioned* 9 And whereas a crane has been erected on the Customs Pier at Ifanamah for the better landing of such items of cargo as may be deemed suitable by the Director of Customs. And whereas by the said license it was stipulate i that the responsibility for such landed cargo is upon the .agents until such cargo is taken over by the Customs* Now iti is hereby agreed that the Agents notify the Director of Customs as occasions arise of the arrival of such cargo as is ordered to be lifted by the crane to enable the Director of Customs to meke the necessary working arrangements, but the Agents shall be under no liability for any expenditure incurred in the work of this crane and the landing of cargo thereby. Also that in regard to any package or item of cargo intended to be landed by the agents but which may actually ^ i M be lifted out of any of the Agent's lighters, or toaigr ^ craft, by the said crane, while such crane is worked under Customs control, the responsibility for the intactness, safety and security of such oackage shall be upon the Government of Bahrain, iiamediately the crrne takes the lift of such package.cAw/paokage^ shall be decae to be free of the lighter, or hired oraft t at that moment and the responsibility of the ^igente shall thereupon oease until the said package is place upon the Pier.

Dear Belgrave, I think you told me that no one was using the crane at the moment because neither L'espers nor the merchants would agree to pay the enhanced landing fees leviable when the crane is used. It seems to me that it should be possible to /;et round a small obstacle like this and I suggest that for packages weighing over a certain limit,the landing charges should be slightly increased and the use of the crane made compulsory t I think this would suit both Fespers and the Bahrain Government • Tours sincerelyj C.D.Belgrave Esquire '•JJCX; ji a¥U Adviser to the Banrain Government, Bahrain,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

B. M 's BHRAHT. Political ^gent, In reference to the moveraents of Native Craft as affecting the State of Bahrain, it may perhaps be of some interest to mention the procedure which regulates this: ARRIVAL: AH native craft must anchor in and, without previous permission, are for passengers at any other spot, on arrival when the nukhudha produces his 'kohl* (i. and manifest of cargo, if he has one. He House the nature and quantity of cargo in to be imported. Local brokers effect his and are balanced out against the declared has to be accounted for satisfactorily, smuggle ashore opium, landing during the the roadstead of Manamah; bidden to land cargo and/or each craft is inspected, e. registration certificate) then reports at the Custom his ship, and the propor*rtion sales, which become imports, cargo, and any difference It is possible that he could night, at an unfrequented spot. CUSTOMS \ND PORT CF^IGX®, BAHRAIN. DEPARTURE: On departure the difference between his deposit and the amount of Customs Duty payable upon his imports is refunded to the Nukhudha, who then takes out Shipping Bills for such cargo as may be exported in his craft. He is then given a manifest prepared in Arabic in the Customs, covering all his expprts. He is not, at the moment, required to produce evidence of the due arrival of such exports at the port of destination; and he sometimes changes his plans according to the exigencies of weather and trade. If departing empty, the nukhudha will take out a Shipping Bill 'in ballast' . Thus there is nothing to prevent him from ship ing export cargo at another port in the Persian Gulf and landing it at some other destination. It has not been thought wise to impose a number of regulations upon illiterate nukhadhas which cannot be enforced from the shore, it being remembered that the main business of the Customs is to collect revenue. The quantity of native craft traffic passing through this port proves the confidence felt by native nukhudhas in the fair treatment accorded to them here, and has a definite oetiring upon the prosperity of this St?, te.Customs House, Bahrain. 14th July.194^. 29th J.Thani.1361.

H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- The Manager of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited, Bahrain, has requested the Bahrain Government to allow an increase in the rates of landing charges on the grounds that since the last increase of rates was sanctioned there has been a further considerable rise in wages and costs of upkeep of lighters. He has requested the Bahrain Government to increase the rates by 30%. 2. ' The landing rates were raised in July 1942 by 20%. 3. Eis Highness Shaikh Sulman has considered the matter and appreciates the fact that since 1942 wages and costs have increased considerably. He is inclined to allow an additional rise inthe landing rates but for one year only, subject to revision after 12 months, and not to the extent which is demanded. He thinks that it wpuld be reasonable to approve a further increase of 20% from the beginning of the new year. His Highness desires me to ascertain your views upon the matter.

Dear Sir, No Bahrein, 30th ^ugust, 19 45. With reference to the copy of a letter from the Director of Customs 6. Port Officer, Bahrein, which you have sent us, we refer to clause 7 cf the License granted to the P e rsian Gulf Lighterage Comapny. This clause calls on the Customs authorities promptly to receive all cargo landed. Ths Customs do not and apparently cannot receive all cargo promptly, i.e., as it is discharged from the Lighterage Company's craft. The point at issue is the acceptance of responsib ility for the cargo between the time it is landed from the Lighterage Company's craft to the time it is received by the Customs, which is sometimes as much as ten days after the landing. It would seem from clause 7 that the Customs authorities must put their house in order and step up their organization and be prepared to receive without fail at least 400 tons per day which is the maximum landing rate likely at the present time. iou will appreciate that it is not possible for the Lighterage Company to retain cargo indefinitely in the.r boats waiting until the Customs authorities feel able to receive it and thereby seriously delaj the discharge of ocean vessels. It is also noted in Clause 7 that the Customs authorities are called on to give a prompt receipt for all cargo received by uhem. the present time receipts are not received from tue Customs until many days after discharge of cargo. ^ours faithfully, For CRAY.

The license granted to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited to act as Agents for certain steamship lines was for 5 years from the 25rd June 1929, and, therefore, expired on the 22nd ^une 1934, vide Clause 1 of the license. Under Clause 2v TT at least six calendar months before the termination of the said period of five years our G overnment will give notice to the Ship's Agents in writing of its intention to renew, terminate, or revise the License or any of its'clauses'. This notice does not appear to have been given, and the Corporation are not now working under a license. The proposal made by the Adviser appears to be open to objection and may raise endless difficulties, it is, therefore, suggested that it may be considered desirable to inform the Adviser that no action should be taken until the return of Mr. Belgrave from leave. In order to regularise the position now that the license has lapsed, it may be considered desirable to extend the period of the license by another six months, and at the same time to give the Agents concerned notice of the Bahrain Government's intention to revise and/or extend the License for a further period of five years. 0 V A &amp;.A.
