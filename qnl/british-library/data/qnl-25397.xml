CONFIDENTIAL [39084] %J S9;5 No. 1. [August 25.] Section 8. (No 176 ) 8lr W ' T ° Wnley t0 Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 25.) Sir ^ ., /„], 1S T stated “ a ette . r fl ; om Foreign Office to tie India Office under date of the 18th June last that you had agreed to the request of the Russian Government that a joint application should be made to the Persian Government for an option for the Trans-Persian Railway on condition that, when it reaches the frontier between the Russian and neutral spheres, an Anglo-Russian Technical Commission should be appointed to examine the two alternative routes, via Shiraz and Kerman. From subsequent telegraphic correspondence that has reached me, it would appear that the above-quoted decision has been so far amended that the Anglo-Russian Technical Commission is to be appointed simultaneously with the application for the option and indeed, that the official request for an option is to be delayed until the component parts oi the Commission have been decided upon. I am not aware from what quarter the pressure has come that has caused the original decision to be altered, but I would venture to express an opinion that, for various reasons, it is highly desirable that the southern and northern sections of the future irans-i ersmn Railway should be constructed simultaneously. Were the section that will traverse the Russian sphere to be constructed first, it would give Russian trade in the Russian and neutral zones an overwhelming superiority, such as it would be very ie- j n( ^ ee ^ ^ or British-Indian trade entering Persia from the south, some years behind, to supplant. It would also, m my opinion, create a most unfortunate impression in this country where a belief would become engendered that we are leaving the railwav development ol the country to the Russians. If such a belief were to gain credence, a strong- opposition would be created to the scheme. u .M^over the creation of a Russian railway to Tehran would necessitate the ^ j a i 6 ^ r . om -^hran to Khanikin, to the great advantage of both Russian and German trade, since an outlet would be created via Alexandretta, and to the great disadvantage of British trade, which, if carried as far as Khoremabad, could get no further except under most unfavourable conditions in comparison with the rail-borne goods of their trade rivals. Although the English group of the Societe d’Etudes and ® rsi 1 an Railways Syndicate have no common object, and appear, after the manner oi British companies, to be antagonistic to each other, I am of opinion that the very * unsatisfactory terminus provided by Khoremabad should not be lost sight of, and that, / should an occasion offer in the course of the negotiations connected with the southern section of the Trans-Persian Railway, a bargain should be made with the Russian Government for the extension of the Mohammerah line to Hamadan. I entirely agree with the views expressed by Sir G. Buchanan in his memorandum of the 7th June, in answer to Sir A. Hirtzell’s letter to Sir A. Nicolson’s letter of the 3rd June, that Angio-Russian co-operation in railway enterprise in Persia is most essential, and it would appear to me that we shall find ourselves in a somewhat invidious position unless we allow the southern section of the Trans-Persian Railway to traverse the British sphere. It seems scarcely conceivable that with a possible development of ? railways throughout Persia we shall be able to condemn the large province of Kerman to go for all time without that most essential element of civilisation, trade and development and social progress—the railway. To a layman the military objections raised appear frivolous, whilst it seems hardly in keeping with the historical record of the greatest civilising Power in the world to condemn a large tract of a foreign country that she has specially marked down as her own for purposes of commercial development to the sterility of a land with no more rapid means of communication than camel transport^ To this it may be objected that motor roads will be opened up. ft such is the intention, all I can say is that the sooner such a scheme is set on foot the better, m order that British trade may not be left hopelessly in the lurch [1829 bb —8] U llSEPIfidU Copy to Lnd ; a 12 SEP 1913p',\v:,v. mm t i j vv, President of the Council and other From conversations that I have ha wi ^ be no easy task to get the Persian officials, I have derived the impressio ^ Trans _Pe rs ian Railway unless the Persian Government to grant an 0 P tl0 y definite assurance that a application for the same is accompame y ^te/ ^ ]ias a i ways been made r- considerable loan will he forthcoming at goc ^ t 4 d’Etudes is to have the quite clear that the loan and the rai way, not be easy to make the Cabinet two, are quite separate undertakings. b ave set t b e i r hearts upon a loan, understand this under present circumsta • &amp; con ditiou of the granting of would only be poskble if M.

For the purpose stated above it is proposed to discuss the note by M. Goukassoff a qtrnmr partisan of one particular policy, and to examine his remarks in detail with a vi'pw f k • • g the relative advantages of the ports under impartial review. ° rin ^ ln ^ m J; h0W ' Ver : be noted that iu this comparison between the ports it is necessarv to follow M. Goukassofi m his assumption that the proposed port!would necessarily be on tk samesRcastheex.stmg port. This, however, is by no means ti cTse. The new port mi!t be at any place m the neighbourhood at which the conditions would be most favourable Therl' reason to believe that the port of Bandar Abbas lay in former^es^ ward and such a site might have considerable advantages, &lt;?.&lt;/., a steep foreshore 7 ^ 6. M. Goukassoff declares that “ Bandar Abbas in its present state is quite unfit to handle goods m any considerable quantities.” He adds “ It is evident that, if it can be made a good harbour at all, the expenses involved will be enormous.” d nf th n t UPPO p ° f hlS a ^ gu 1 ment tbat Bandar Abbas would not be a suitable port for the terminus No. 5033 8 erSian 75 ^ qU ° teS Ll0yd ’ S Regi8ter and Bandar Abbas Consular 6 Report The quotation from Lloyd’s Register is “ an open roadstead, where vessels load and di&lt;? charge by lighters. There is a depth of 17 feet of water at L. W. 0. S. T.” If this statement is taken to mean that at low water a vessel drawing more than 17 feet cannot find anchorage m the port, it is misleading, for, according to the Persian Gulf Pilot (pave w 1 mo e o U Tf a T° rage 18 m fathoms at a bout 3 miles from the shore. Consular Report is 2 mle! out T ThT™ 8 t0 “ bea ° h Te* 1 f,T eS ver yg radua l'y ‘he 4 fathoms anchorage is 2 miles out. The expression open roadstead ” may also be misunderstood. There is no monsoon at Bandar Abbas (Proceedings of Inter-departmental Committee, paragraph 11 ) The prevailing wind is from the west-south-west and blows for “ probably 300 days in the year” (Captain Biscoe). The anchorage is satisfactorily sheltered against this and ill other winds except that from the south-east. But even when the wind is in this quarter it is “ seldom rough enough to hamper the discharge of cargo. ” 1 0m 7. The misleading nature of some of M. Goukassofl’s statements having been indicated it may be admitted at once that Bandar Abbas in its present state and ^sit.7n is not a„ ^ port for the terminus of the Trans-Persian or any railway. heavyTpenditurT h 1 ' 6 ™ 1 ’ PreClUde ^ h™ 8 made into a stable port without unduly 8. To be suitable a port should have (a) a sheltered anchorage where ships can load and unload from lighters at all times • (b) a foreshore sufficient^ steep to allow of the construction of comparatively short jetties for the lighters to use at all tides; ^ (c) a sheltered anchorage for the lighters close to the jetties, and the absence of surf or swell on the foreshore ; ~A Oh ah bar. Owatar. mz- Jim (d) ample space for sheds close to the jetties and an ample extent of foreshore to allow of the future development of the port ; (e) an adequate supply of fresh water. 9. If Bandar Abbas is considered in the light of these requirements it is found that as regards (a) , the requirement is complied with (see paragraph 6) ; (b) , the present foreshore is not steep but Mr. Johns has estimated the length of the jetties required at “ perhaps 250 yards ” ; (c) , there is no surf or swell and dredging would give the required anchorage for lighters. The bottom is sandy and dredging would not be difficult; (d) , there are 6 miles of sea frontage ; (e) , the water-supply of Bandar Abbas itself is not good but good water is got at Nai- band, 3 miles to the east, whence it could be brought by a pipe line or aqueduct. 10. As noted above, these conditions would, it is believed, be more favourable at another site more to the westward. Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen’s Mission (1904-05) reported very favour ably on Bandar Abbas as a port and stated that Clarence Strait, close by, afforded an excellent site for a protected harbour. 11. M. Goukassoff, having disposed of Bandar Abbas, goes on to say “ there are only Chahbar and Gwatar, both of which present all the features necessary for making a good harbour capable of serving as a terminus for a trans-continental line.” It is necessary, therefore, to consi der these two ports in the light of the requirements given in paragraph 8. 12. Taking Chahbar first, it is found that as regards (а) , during Shamals, (north winds) which are fairly frequent in the winter, steamers have to leave the anchorage near the town and lie just inside Ras Kuhlab i.e., 5 miles away (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Volume 2, page 352); (б) , the whole inner part of the bay is very shallow : nowhere does deep water approach the beach (Persian Galf Gazetteer, Volume 2, page 352) ' (c) , from June to September a heavy swell caused by the South-West Monsoon rolls in (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Volume 2, page 352); (d) , the shore is generally rocky, with cliffs in places : between Chahbar Point and Chahbar there 1S a sandy beach but the land rises and behind Chahbar attains a height of 400 feet : thereat of the perimeter of the bay is low and swampy (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Volume 2, page 352); ^ (e) , there is an abundant supply of good water. 13. If Gwatar be considered similarly, it is found as regards (а) , it is not sheltered: the whole area of the bay is entirely open to the south ; (б) , except during the monsoon, lighters could discharge 4|se to the shore of the Dasht The construction of jetties river, to which an easy and straight channel leads, would be bot h easy and inexpensive ; (c) , from June to September a heavy swell caused by the South-West Monsoon rolls in ; (d) , the land on the east and west sides of the bav is rochv nna tin 11 ,, shore is low swampy coast.

While noting that the distribution of interests as proposed in this protocol appears satisfactory to His Majesty s Government, the attention of the British group has been uy arrested by the stipulations laid down by the Russian Government in their memorandum of the 14th May in regard to absolute equality between the three parties m the neutral zone. Until, however, the British group are advised that His Majesty’s brovernment have assented in principle to the Russian stipulations, they propose in negotiating with their foreign^ associates to be guided, as far as possible, by the principle Hid down by the Foreign Office in their letters of the 4th and 24th February, namely, that British control must predominate in the southern or Gulf section of any trans-Fersian line or of the branches which may be made, and that this control shall not be invalidated by any arrangement which may be made in regard to the percentage ol other (z.e., non-British) participation in the undertaking.” With reference to the question of the procedure to be adopted in the matter of approaching the Persian Government, with a view to obtaining an option for the construction of a trans-Persian railway, in pursuance of the objects for which the ociete ^d Etudes was formed, the British group welcome the steps proposed by His Majesty s Government, and they will much appreciate the opportunity to be offered t em of expressing their views as to the precise language in which application to the Persian Government for this option is to be made. v / s ?^ serve( ^ y° ur letter under reply makes no mention of the manner in which it is proposed to deal with the points at issue as regards alignment south of iehran, but it is assumed by the British group of the Societe that when His Majesty’s Government have satisfied themselves by closer examination of the principle and etails of this question, they will indicate to the Societe d’Etudes an alignment clear of any engagements to third parties or other encumbrances, so that, should the option be taken up at a future time by the prospective concession holders, these last would not find their activities circumscribed or negatived by the necessity of having to enter into negotiations with other parties.

Ana anA lt * Vrob- The Senior General Staff Officer, M. 0. 3. Meshed. 3rd February 1913. As the current year is likely to see the inception of several schemes of roii construction, the completion of which must of necessity greatly improve tim strategical position of the Russians m their Central Asian dominions it sTe m ! favourable moment to collate the information bearing on this point which h 4 reached us m the last 2 or 3 years, and briefly to examine its probable effect on the ssr,c e \ c ss»tu“ g *”“ *** ^ —- ■ «»•*aSi At any time 10 to 30 years ago, a period during which “ scares of Rus-d-n aggression on India weie of frequent occurrence, the Russian position with regard to such a campaign was vastly inferior in respect to railway communications to the position of the present day. it is, however, no oveitatem™* to assert that the realisation of the present projected construction will, in from 3 to 5 vears’ time, place Russia in a position as far ahead of the nresent one as the latter id ahead of the condition of affairs 10 vears a&lt;ro. In 1886 the Central Asian Railway from the eastern shore of the Caspian had only reached Merv; m the following year it had been extended to Samarkand but the Charjui bridge was only opened to traffic in 1888, and it was not till 1899 that tne lines to Tashkent and Andijan were completed. The Merv-Ku r, hk branch was opened in 1898, and an outlet for the railway on the Afghan frontier on the direct line to Herat supplied. Prior to the construction of this branch troops would have been obliged to march on the lines of advance Herat and Kabul from Merv and from Samarkand, distances respectively of 215 and 239 miles to the Afghan frontier. Transport would have been collected at, and marched from the Central Asian line and proportionate wastage of men and animals would have* resulted. (The Government flotilla and available civilian water transport could have assisted in the conveyance of men and material to Termez then as now ) The extension of the Centred Asian line to Tashkent and Andijan was important inasmuch as it enabled the garrisons of eastern and north-eastern Turkistan to be conveyed readily to the detraining points for the Afghan frontier on the Cen tral Asian Railway, It was of great importance also as regards mobilization but to a modified extent only, as during a crisis, when a large portion of the troops required for active operations were being conveyed south-westwards, the tide of reinforcements from Russia would have been setting in a contrary direction and would have inevitably hampered the working of a single line none too well •equipped in any respect. Even 10 years ago the Central Asian line was depend ent for every necessity of a railway on shipments across the Caspian, rolling stock was inferior both in quantity and quality to that of the present day, and the supply was inelastic as every car or engine had to be ferried across piece-meal from Russia. The rails in use were of a light type and might have been expected to cause many break-downs during a prolonged strain while their limitations in quantity were the same as those of the rolling stock. In one point only was the line of 10 to 15 years ago in a better position from n, military point of view than it is at present. It was practically a military line; the population of the country dependent on commodities from Russia was much less than it is to-day, and although the line was already a factor in the commercial development of the country it played a far slighter role in that respect, and its temporary conversions into a military railway, pure and simple, would have been attended with less disastrous results to commerce and industry than would be the case at the present time. S63GSB* ,,■^ 1 . I —ll »» I. 2 The position of affairs as regards railway facilities in Russian Central Asia 12 years a&lt;ro, after the completion of the Kushk branch and before the commence ment of the Tashkent-Orenburg line, may be briefly summarised as follows: a single line of railway with its western extremity resting on a somewhat cramped port of the Caspian Sea across which _ all material and fuel for the line, all troops and warlike material must be carried to be subsequently dealt with 1 /* by the line with its north-eastern and eastern extremities (distance respect ively 1 158 and 1,266 miles) in the air. A strategical single line 194 miles in length from the Central Asian Railway to the vicinity of the Afghan frontier. Troops from districts in Russia convenient for reinforcing in the Central Asian garrison compelled to travel by a devious route, while the Siberian troops might be consi dered a negligible quantity as regards any co-operation to be expected from them. 2. In 1904 a new and very important factor was introduced into the situa tion by the completion of the Tashkent-Orenburg line and its junction with, the Central Asian Railway at Tashkent. Not only could troops be conveyed in to Central Asia by two routes instead of one, but also the resources of the Cen tral Asian line were automatically increased by the junction with the new line, and its inelastic rolling-stock was rendered capable of supplementation in an emergency by the supply in possession of lines in European Russia, In addition, the new line commenced from Samara—a point not only pos sessing good communications with the network of Russian railways, and sup plying a quicker route than thatrw the Caspian, but also directly connected with the yrans-Siberian Railway and thus affording a means of communication be-, tween the Turkistan and Siberian garrisons, albeit by a devious route. But great as are the advantages gained by the possession of the Tashkent Railway, they are perhaps less real from the point of view of a military railway than would appear at first sight* To begin with the Tashkent line, like its pre-s decessor the Central Asian, is a single line, its length from Orenburg to Tash kent is 1,152 miles, and a further distance pf 220, 450 and 794 miles, respectively, must be reckoned in to Samarkand, Charjui and Kushk, the present jumping-off places ” for the Afghan frontier. In the second place the economic position of Turkistan has considerably altered in the last few years. Its destined fate is to supply Russia with suffici ent cotton for the demands of an increasing textile industry and to enable her to dispense entirely with foreign cotton. To this end all efforts of the administration are directed, and the numerous schemes for irrigation and colonisation a;e in tended, directly or indirectly, to foster this obj set. During 1912 upwards of 220,00(&gt; tons of cotton were exported from Russian Central Asia by the two existing lines, and schemes for the irrigation of thousands of acres in the. near future with’ a proportionate increase of the cotton crop are even now in operation. But the conclusion of the matter is not reached by the export of the cotton crop alone. For some years past Turkistan has not produced sufficient grain for her needs, land which formerly grew grain is now growing cotton. Ferghana is almost entirely under cotton—and an increasing population must be fed. A very large quantity of grain is, therefore, imported annually from Russia—290,000 tons,in 1910,—the major part of which falls to the share of the Tashkent line. Add to this the annual export of perhaps 35,000 to 50,000 tons of fish from the Aral Sea, large quantities of fruit coupled with the import of machinery and the many commodities, needed by a developing country, and it may easily be seen that the resources of both lines are at present fully taxed even in normal times of peace. A campaign of a serious nature such as an advance southwards on India through Afghanistan, involving the transport over a protracted period of large bodies of troops and .consignments of war material, would inevitably close the exist ing railways to all commercial traffic of a nature not absolutely vital to the existence of the population. It is likely too that the import' of grain would be curtailed. Indeed if the campaign were of long duration, as one of the descrip tion outlined above must, almost of necessity prove the import of a consider able quantity of the grain would automatically cease, as the cotton crops would find no outlet and the land would revert to the cultivation of grain. The effecton Russia herself of the cessation of the Central Asian cotton supply while at war withn maritime power like England, and thus doubly dependent on it would be little less than disastrous. &gt; v u P For such a campaign it is probable that the two lines of operations would be through Termez on Kabul, and through Kushk on Herat, and presumably the troops available fcom the first Army Corps-in Turkistan—would be detailed for the first-named, and those from the 2nd Army Corps—in Trans-Caspia—for the second. If it were possible to furnish the extra troops and material required for the Kabul line through Orenburg, and those for the Herat line through Krasnovodsk, a cross-stream of troop and freight trains with consequent delay and confusion would be avoided, but it would mean in point of fact that each line of advance was dependent on one single line. Probably such an arrangement would not prove workable in practice and the disadvantages of the cross-stream would have to be faced. Either alternative is, of course, far better than being dependent on one single line of railway for both lines of advance as would have been the case 10 years ago ; but neither is ideal. It will be seen that the rail ways now projected furnish a solution to most of the difficulties touched on. To the local railway communications summarised at the conclusion of para graph 1 may now be added; a second single line commencing from a district in Russia convenient for reinforcing the Turkistan garrison, and affording improved means of communication with the Siberian garrisons. Against this must be noted the fact that the normal tasks devolving on both railways are far heavier than they were 10 years ago, and that even their partial conversion into mili tary lines would result in financial loss with consequent distress to both Turki stan and Russia herself. Strategic railway communication with the Afghan frontier has not increased. It must be remarked, however, that the Central Asian line is to-day more efficient than it was 10 years ago. Not only has the rolling-stock in possession of the line increased considerably, but further addition to it is facilitated by the construction of the Tashkent line. The light rails have been replaced by others of a solid type calculated to bear a prolonged strain and permitting increased speed, and many improvements to the line against interruption by the flood water have been effected. The Kushk branch, also, has now sufficient broad-gauge material collected at rail-head to continue the line to Herat, and a reserve of rolling-stock is main tained at Kushk. In addition several feeder lines to the Central Asian lines have been con structed which, although they have no direct bearing on the strategical question, must be regarded as an asset inasmuch as they improve the general communi cation of the country. The naphtha industry in Turkistan has made great strides of late years, and to some extent the Central Asian Hue is freed from the conveyance of oil fuel along its entire length. 3. The projected railway construction, the commencement of which the current year will witness as far as can be foreseen at present, may be generally divided into two classes:— (1) New railways for Turkistan itself. (2) New railways improving railway connections of Russian Central Asia with European Russia and wffth Siberia. It will be convenient to consider each class separately, but before doing so it is necessary to touch on the course which the mobilization of the Turkistan Military District would probably take. Reservists resident in Russian Central Asia are to-day far from sufficient to bring the field-units of the Turkistan Military District up to war strength, and it may be roughly calculated that the present shortage would amount to little less than 10,000 men. These would have to be drawn from districts in European Russia. It appears most probable that the districts now furnishingPi L the puielj'Russian recruits (it is believed that the proportion per unit v hen com pleted to war strength has been arranged at 66 % Russians to 34% subject races such as Jew-s, Poles, etc.) namely the Kazan Military District extending along the Volga from Kazan on the north to Saratov on the south, and the lambov Govern ment of the Moscow Military District would be called upon to supply the requisite number. The non-Russian element would probably be despatched as are the recruits at the present time mainly from the Warsaw Military District and Poland generally. But even when brought up to war strength, the Turkistan Military District would only be in a position to furnish a proportion of the numerous troops required for a serious campaign of aggression, and additional units would have to be sent from outside. In the first instance it seems likely that the Kazan Military District (16th and 24th Army Corps) would be called on to furnish further intact units, but subsequently troops might have to be despatched from the Caucasus, Russia, or Siberia. The task thus confronting the railway system of Russian Central Asia, and its connections with the main Russian and Siberian systems would be :— The distribution of locally resident reservists to their corps* The filling up of Turkistan units by reservists from Russia. The conveyance of additional intact units from Russia, probably from the Volga basin. The possible conveyance of further reinforcements from the Caucasus, Russia or Siberia. The conveyance of all troops to rail-end for the lines of advance. The conveyance of war material and supplies to rail-head and the mainte nance of the troops in the field. The question of resident reservists in Russian Central Asia deserves some special consideration inasmuch as their present position may have changed consider ably by the time the projected railways are completed. According to one state ment it is anticipated that in 10 years time the Russian population of Russian Central Asia will furnish sufficient reservists to bring the Turkistan Military Dis trict up to war strength. This is certainly optimistic, but there is no doubt that the influx of settlers is considerably on the increase. In the 5 years 1907-12, 2-J- million Russian immigrants were settled on the land and during the last year 260,000 new settlers arrived and a far smaller number of disappointed settlers returning ♦Turkistan News. to Russ i a Wa s noted*. The majority are at present domiciled in Semiryechia where there are no railway facilities at all, and in Syr Darya where except in the vicinity of the main line there are none, and thus the Russian population is incon veniently placed for rapid mobilization. But the irrigation schemes in the Famine Steppe and Ferghana provide for a number of settlers in a far more convenient position, and the construction of feeders in both these tracts is provided for. In addition, conscription, formerly applicable to Semiryechia only, has for over 2 years been extended to Russians in all parts of Central Asia, and reservists are encouraged to settle on the land and to seek employment in the local railways. There is thus every probability of a considerable increase in the numbers of resident reservists in the next few years. The railways would have to deal with them in one way or another, but the effect would be to increase the first task noted above and to decrease the second. 4. New railways for Turkistan itself comprise four separate projects, each of which must influence the course of future mobilization in various essential parti culars. Their completion as a whole will greatly simplify the problems confront ing the Russian military authorities. The projects are:— (a) A single railway of normal gauge from Charjoi on the Central Asian „ Railway, through Khiva and Kkvalme - Kungrad to a point of jnno- tion with the Russian system at Alexandrov Gai.on (6) A single railway of normal gauge from Kaglian (new Bokhara) “ Oxus line. n Central Asian Railway, Termez on the Afghan frontier. throU S h Kars “ Kerki to 5 (c) A single railway of normal gauge from Arys on the Tashkent line to ' Semiryecbia line. 18 Vyerni, with probable subse- Siberian system. quent extension to meet the (d) A series of feeder lines, both normal and narrow gauge, in the Famine Steppe and Ferghana. Possible other branch lines elsewhere. The first two projects may be classed as directly strategic. The effect of the two last would be indirect but none the less they have an important bearing on the question of mobilization In foreshadowing the construction of projects (n) and (b) the Turkistan press, while admitting their strategic possibilities has laid special stress on their preponderant commercial and economic significance, and the same tone was maintained m conversations I recently took partin at Tashkent with the acting Governor-General of Turkistan and the diplomatic official attached to Jns stall, ihere can be no doubt that this point of view is, within certain limits perfectly sincere. Russian Central Asia is intended to prove a paying concern and the Khanates of Bokhara and Khiva axe to-day heavily handicapped by deficient communications, while a third outlet to Russia is urgently needed even under pre sent conditions. With improved irrigation and extended cultivation the increase of existing communications would be absolutely necessary if future products are to be placed on the market at all. The relations between Russia and England have improved, and the burden of their mutual distrust has shifted in each case to a like feeling towards Germany— a position of affairs ensuring a present community of interests. But ententes and even alliances are not eternal, and it needs no lively imagination to picture a change in the relations between the two powers which might lend the strategic aspect of the new railways a far higher importance than their commercial objects now enjoy. That such a change is not likely to occur for some years is all in favour of Russia, as the new arrangement will have ample time to elaborate into working order. The change in the point of view as regards the primary object to be attained may be illustrated by the case of the second of the four projects outlined above the Oxus Railway. Its initiation is no new thing, and is attributed to the pressure of General Kuropatkin, some years before the Russo-Japanese War, for the doubling of the Kushk branch. The Minister of Finance was in agreement with the neces sity of increasing strategic railway facilities to the Afghan frontier, but the Kushk line is unproductive, and he hoped to secure some tangible profitable return in addition to strategic advantages, and proposed a line to Termez in lieu. Had it not been for the outbreak of the Russo-Jar anese War and the years of internal disorder and financial crisis which succeeded it, there is little doubt that the Oxus ’ Railway would have already been a fait accompli. Its primary aim was thus to be a strategic railway. In the adoption of the project some 12 years after its original proposal we see that the avowed main object is now commercial, the strategic end to be gained having been relegated to the position of a secondary asset. But it is an asset for all that and an important one. The Charjui-Khiva-Alexandrov Gai project, curiously enough, also owes its existence to a proposal to double an existing line—the Tashkent-Orenburg. In this case also there are certainly sufficient economic ends to be gained to justify its construction from that point of view, but it will be seen that as a strategic line it will have far greater significance than the mere doubling of the Tashkent Railway could have possessed. (a) Singularly little regarding this project has appeared in the local press, “ Khiva line ” an ^ We - Were rece ^ information that a railway survey was being carried on between Charjui and Khiva (and also between Charjui and Kerki) for more than a year before the first mention of the subject was made in the papers in S63GSBn March of last year. This was to the effect that the Eastern-Rayon Committee was considering a proposal to link up the Khivan Khanate and the Amu Darya Division with the Russian system by a railway through the Uralsk region. Ac cording to recent information the survey has been completed between Charjui and Kungrad, and the engineer in charge of the Orsk-Troitsk branch construction has been deputed to supervise survey operations—presumably of the northern portion! cf the line. I was informed while at Tashkent that work on this line would pro ceed concurrently with that on the other projects, and that the point of junction with the Russian system selected was Alexandrov Gai. No details of the trace of the line have been published, but it appears fairly certain that it will commence at a point opposite to Charjui on the right (east) bank of the Amu Darya and will follow this bank as far as the gorge of Daweh-i-Burgaz where it will cross to the left bank (bridging material was sent downstream from Charjui in the summer) and proceed through Khiva and Kungrad in a north-westerly direction. We have quite recently heard that engineers are selecting a site on the right bank opposite Charjui for a station and railway works, and this can hardly be for any other pur pose than the intended southern starting point of the railway. No details as to the length of the railway have been published, but it would presumably be between 1,000 and 1,100 miles long. , It will be noted that each extremity of the projected line is singularly well adapted to purposes of mobilization. 156 miles of rail only separate Alexandrov Gai from a point on the left bank of the Volga opposite to Saratov—a town which possesses connections by rail with Tambov, Penza, Samara, Simbirsk, and Kazan, the main recruiting ground of the Turkistan Military District, and the tract from which additional intact units would probably be despatched in the first in stance. From the starting point opposite to Saratov, the approximate distances by the projected line to Kushk and Termez by rail would be respectively 1,600 and 1,641 miles. From Samara—the alternative outlet to the Kazan Military District—by the Tashkent-Orenburg line the distance to the same frontier posts are respectively 2,178 and 2,069 miles or, assuming the speed of troop trains at 200 miles per 24 hours, an additional thme days to Kushk and two days to Termez. Saratov to Kushk via Asfcrachan and the Caspian would take about one day longer than by the project ed line, but it offers the additional disadvantage of transhipment and of excum- brance'of the western half of the Central Asian line, and this route would not be available in the winter months. As regards the southern extremity, not only is Charjui excellently situated for despatching troop-trains along the Central Asian Railway north-east to Kaghan (75 miles) for Termez, and south-west to Merv (150 miles) for Kushk, without interfering in the least with communication between Tashkent and Kaghan on the one hand, and Krasnovodsk and Merv on the other, but it is also the head-quarters of the Amu Darya flotilla which would co-operate in the conveyance of material and, if necessary, troops to Termez. (b) The adoption of the trace from Kaghan through Karshi, Kerki, and Kilif, &lt;f . „ to Termez has, since the revival of the Oxus line. scheme, seemed certain till quite lately when the substitution of Katta Kurghan fo’Kaghan as a point of departure from the Central Asian Railway was mooted. It seems, however, likely that the choice of Kaghan will be maintained. The length by this alignment would be 31Q . , ,, miles. Branches to Guzar and Kitah* will, in addition, probably be constructed. A number of alternative alignments have been surveyed in the past; viz., from— Juma. Katta Kurghan. Kermine. Farab. / Charjui. For a purely strategic railway the Farab alignment would no doubt have been followed as it is 70 to 100 miles shorter than that selected, but from an eco nomic point of view its value would have been very insignificant.7 ^ ^ ■’ . i ♦ &lt;—v— The Charjui alignment would have involved a bridge over the Amu Darva at Kerki and would have had much the same length as that from Farab It ?s worth noting that if a bridge at Kerki ever comes to be built the survev for the section Charju,-Kerki has been completed and the laying of the rails on it would ^material y shorten the distance for military purposes. The extra 75 miles from f^Lharjui to Kaghan would also bo avoided for the Alexandrov Gai route. The value of a railway to the frontier point of Termez is too evident to need further elaboration. on the road to Kabul I was informed at Tashkent that the ment of actual work, and we have recently to select sites between Kerki and Karshi, spring would witness the commence- heard of the departure of engineers for railway stations. (c) The province of Semiryechia is exceedingly fertile, and though the “ Semiryechia line.' climate is too cold for cotton to flourish it . . 18 ca pable of the production of large quan tities of wheat. The part that it is destined to play in the economic develop ment of Russian Central Asia is that of a provider of grain for the cotton-growing regions. The necessity for grain import from European Russia will thus be in large measure, if not entirely obviated, the normal burden on the Tashkent- Orenburg Railway materially lightened, and its resources freed for other tasks among them the transport of troops and war material. Till the Arys-Vyerni line is completed the scheme cannot be realised from default of railway com munications. Even when the new railway is working the section Arys-Tashkent would still be encumbered by g:ain traffic, but its length is only 96 miles, and the doubling of the section would be a task of no great magnitude. The construction of the line has for the last three years been regularly an nounced for the ensuing spring, but partly owing to the non-completion of finan cial arrangements, and partly to the difficulty of deciding on the exact align ment to be followed,—the inclusion or not of Chimkent being the chief rock on which the inception of the scheme has split—the announcement has not yet been carried into effect. Even now the exact alignment does not seem to be certain although there is little doubt that a commencement will be made almost imme diately. It is probable that the line will have a general length of about 500 to 550 miles, and that it will be continued to Iliisk. Its immediate effect on strategic facilities for the Chinese frontier will be important. During the Chinese crisis early in 1911 troops despatched via Tash kent had to drag along a weary 600 miles of road to Djarkent, The distance from Iliisk to the Chinese frontier opposite Kuldja is little over 150 miles. With regard to the more immediate purpose of this memorandum, the result of its construction will be greatly to facilitate the mobilisation of reservists resident in Semiryechia, and their distribution to their units. The province is eminently suited in respect of climate to colonisation by Europeans, it contains a larger number of Russian settlers than any other province of Russian Central Asia, and it is likely to retain its lead. Even without the probable eventual construction of further branch lines the new railway will be an important asset in mobiliza tion. The subsequent extension of the line to meet the projected Southern Sibe rian Railway is contemplated. Another important link between the garrison of Russian Central Asia and Siberia will thus be added. (d) The schemes for feeders need not be entered into here in detail. Several already exist in Ferghana and more are projected. Others will be constructed • in the Famine Steppe concurrently with irrigation work, the most important being a normal gauge branch between the stations of Syrdarinskaya and Jizak on the Central Asian Railway with a proposed length of 135 miles. A branch from Tashkent to Pskent; 30 miles to the south is also under consideration. Generally speaking, the internal communications of Russian Central Asia may be expected to improve considerably in the next few years owing to such lines, and the task of collecting reservists scattered all over the country will be much facilitated.f 8 5. Foremost among new railways improving communication with European Russia is, of course, the Charjui-Alexandrov Gai line which has been considered among railways in Turkistan itself. In 1910, permission was given to a company engaged on the construction of a line from Liubertsa to Arzamas to construct the section Arzamas-Kinel with* a bridge over the Volga at Simbirsk. If this project is realised the commumcation between Tashkent and Petersburg will be considerably shortened. Together with projected construction in Southern Siberia may be mentioned another scheme, supplying lateral communication between the Saratov-As- trachan and the Tashkent lines. This is the projected line from Uralsk to Ueitsk on the Tashkent Railway for the construction of which permission was requested early last year. The section Ershov-Uralsk is narrow-gauge. It is proposed to convert it to a line of normal gauge and to continue it to Ueitsk from which place a short branch already runs westward to some salt works to meet it. From Ueitsk the line would be prolonged to meet the Trans-Siberian Railway through Orsk and Troitsk at Cheliabinsk, and would, in addition, form a portion of the projected Southern Siberian line thiough Akmolinsk to Semipalatinsk, and of the Altai line from Semipalatinsk through Barnaul to Novomkolaevsk on the Trans-Siberian line. The papers have recently mentioned the Orsk-Troitsk* section as under *Section Troitsk Kustanai (on Tobol River) construction, and in 1911 the Council of is shewn on Railway map as under construction. Ministers ruled that both the Southern Siberian and Altai lines should be constructed from Government funds. Pro^ visional offices for the latter are shortly to be established at St. Petersburg. The survey for an additional branch from Petropavlovsk on the Trans- Siberian Railway southwards through Kokchetav and Akmolinsk to the Spasski Works was ordered in 1911, and a reconnaissance for an extension to meet the Arys-Vyerni line was provided for, for the current year. It would thus appear that considerably improved communication will be provided between the Trans-Siberian and Tashkent lines through Orsk and Troitsk very soon, while a still shorter and more important link between the two systems the junction .by rail of Vyerni and (probably) Semipalatinsk is not likely to b« delayed very long. Not only would the transfer of troops between Omsk and Turkistan Military Districts be facilitated, but the mobilization of reservists in the Omsk District would be much accelerated by the projected construction. 6. If construction be commenced early in the current year as at present anticipated, a term of 3 to 5 years should see the termination of most of it. The Tashkent-Orenburg line with a length of 1,156 miles was completed within 4 years, and with the exception of the Siberian projects, none o*f the other lines but that from Char jui to Alexandrov Gai have anything like the same extent, and the facilities for construction are greater than those existent at the time of the laying of the Tashkent line. We are certainly justified in anticipating that within 5 years, to 'the raih way facilities existent in Russian Central Asia at the present day will be added :—• a third single line from a district in European Russia convenient for reinforceing the Turkistan Military District j a second strategic railway to the Afghan frontier ; a Semiryechia line facilitating the despatch of troops to or from the Chinese frontier, and the collection and distribution of reservists improved and probably direct communication between Siberia ; improved internal railway communications. 7. A Russian General Staff Officer at Meshed recently stated that mobilized pnits from European Russia would reach the Turkistan Military District 40 daysafter the order for mobilization had been given.

Reservists from Poland might, for units in Turkistan, travel by the Russian system to Saratov and Samara, and the Central Asian Railwly need only deal m the first instance with those for Trans-Caspian units. 7 Dislocation of ordinary traffic and commerce would in any case be inevitable but doubtless less serious than under existing conditions, more especially as the Tashkent line would be freed from the import of grain along its entire length. It is quite possible that by the time the projected construction is completed northern Persia may have been absorbed by Russia, and the problem of an advance through Khorasan may have to be faced. But even in such an event any advance must of necessity be based on the Central Asian Railway and the improvement m the communication of the latter with Russia can onlv make for increased efficiency. * J E.

LAKE'S SECRET MEMORANDUM OF JUNE 6 1913. Headings numbered 2, 3 and 4 contain views and deductions that are really ^ worthless, as they are based on misconception and even on ignorance of the interpretation of our treaty with Russia of 1907. ^ The Commander-in-Chief appears to have forgotten the contents of the despatch that he signed on February 23rd, 1911, which contained the folio win condition :— “ That, in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should c pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understand- “ ing with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the “ Perso-Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones*’. This condition has presumably been communicated to the Russian Govern ment, and if we fail to meet their views as regards the alignment of the Trans-Persian Railway, which we know they have always wished should pass through Kerman and which is the obvious route, surely it is unnecessary to reproach them with the malicious and unfriendly intention of building a railway to Meshed and southwards when they simply proclaim their full liberty of action in that direction. Further, even if Russia were to build a line to Meshed and southward, there is no question of “ the length to which she is “ prepared to go in disregard of the Convention”, since she is perfectly entitled by the Convention to do so. Consequently the deduction made in paragraph 4 i from the supposed attitude of Russia, as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, appears to be entirely misplaced. ^ In paragraph 10 it is argued that the danger of a Russian advance from Meshed southwards is less than an advance via Kerman, since it ct would be “ dependent on the single line of rail from the Caspian Sea to Askabad”. This is a curious statement, since an advance via Meshed would have the advantage, not only of the Trans-Caspian Railway, but also of the Orenburg-Tashkend Railway, by which troops could be transferred direct from Moscow to Askabad without even changing carriages. In spite of any argument brought forward by the Commander-in-Chief, it is perfectly obvious, from a glance at the map, that a Russian advance whether by Kerman or Meshed would expose the flank of our position to being turned; and since it is equally clear that sooner or later the Trans-Persian Rail way will be constructed, the question arises whether it would not be better to allow the railway to pass through Kerman and to obtain from Russia a definite agreement that no line shall be built in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Afghan border rather than to leave to Russia the right, not only to build a railway from Yezd to Kerman, but also from Askabad to the neighbourhood of Gazik on the Afghan border, as in each case she has a perfect right to do ? To provide however an additional Army of 60,000 men from India is how ever absolutely out of the question. H.,—10-6-13.1 T/us Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. SECRET. Trans-Persian Railway. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th May 1913. Private. Your Secret Despatch. No. 11 of 13th February. Trans-Persian Hallway. 1 lease let me have your personal views on question of alignment as soon as possible. Also whether if main line is taken to Kerman, military authorities consider that immediate increase of army or other measures will be necessary, and if so, what. Russia has made it clear that if Kerman is not included the scheme will break down altogether, and she will consider herself free to build as she pleases, including eventually line to Meshed and southwards. \\ hether this risk is worth taking must depend partly on immediate measures which inclusion of Kerman would necessitate Memorandum by the Indian General Staff. The following remarks by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief are submitted upon the points raised in the “ Private ” telegram P. of 29th May 1913, from the Secretary of State to His Excellency the Viceroy :— 1. taking the first points raised in the telegram—whether an immediate increase to the army in India, or other measures, will be necessary if the main line is taken to Kerman, and if so what increase or other measures— no satisfactory attempt to frame the reply can be made without an endeavour to gauge the Russian attitude of mind as it appears to us to be therein revealed. 2. If no intention inimical to British interests or to the security of our military possession of India can be discovered, we might conclude that Russia will adhere for some considerable time to the spirit and letter of the Convention and to her declared policy of respecting our wishes and interests, and we might, therefore, postpone steps to protect ourselves against future dangers. It is no part of our business to speculate on the influence, temporary perhaps, which has brought about the present remonstrance, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the building of railways has an effect far beyond the present generation, and that the influence now at work may re-assert itself again and again and have a permanent effect on Russian policy. With every wish to credit Russia with friendly intention, we find in the telegram under consideration evidence of a contrary nature which, in our opinion, cannot be ignored with prudence, especially if we remember her present attitude on the Afghan border. Her protest against the omission of Kerman from the direct line is accompanied by an assertion of freedom to build elsewhere, including Meshed and southwards of that place. But Russia is already free to build where she likes in her own sphere, though in the neutral sphere “ previous arrangement ” with us, if we wish it, is implied in the Convention. Her claim for freedom must, therefore, have reference to the neutral sphere and amounts to an intimation that she will consider herself released from the “ previous arrangement ” clause. 3. The reference to a line to Meshed and southwards is in this light significant. The line can hardly be intended to foster her own trade, for it would lead to no industrial or commercial centre without crossing the limit of our sphere. There can be no pretence that it is designed for a through connection between Russia and India, between West and East, for it would involve either the crossing of the Caspian Sea or a very circuitous route via Tashkend and Orenburg. Moreover, it is ex hypothesi to be built without S. 215. A■ys* wmmmm. 9 mm 2 our consent, which, therefore, excludes any idea of linking India with Russia by means of this line. On the other hand, aii}^ line from the Central Asian Railway in the direction of Seistan constitutes a direct menace to our strategical position covering the North West Frontier, which it threatens in flank. The Russian General Staff are well aware of this, and by choosing this line as an alternative they show how anxious they are to ensure that any line that is built should benefit Russia strategically. This would appear to have been in their minds from the first, when Captain Rittich mooted the through Trans-Persian line as a strategic measure, with Chahbar for its terminus as a port on the open sea under Russian influence. Irom the extracts which we have been allowed to see from the memo randum which accompanied the original Consortium proposal, it is also clear that the Russian strategical requirements were therein carefully safeguarded. Later on M. Sazonoff expressed his disappointment at the selection of Bandar Abbas, and contrasted that port with Chahbar or Gwattar much to its dis advantage, though his information on that point was incorrect, Bandar Abbas being in fact the best port on that coast. 4. It, therefore, seems to be a fair deduction from her present attitude following on what has preceded it, that Russia desires the through railway to be built m such a way that she shall benefit strategically, and rightly thinks that any such benefit would be neutralised by its leading direct to Bandar Abbas, instead of to Kerman. The threat which she now holds out and the length to which she is prepared to go in disregard of the Convention’ is a measure of her disappointment at having to forego the strategic value of a direct connection between the railways of Southern Russia and Kerman It may also be pointed out that, should we withdraw from our present position and agree to the mam line passing through Kerman, Russia will still be at liberty to construct a line south from Meshed and will indeed have an additional inducement to repeat the process of bringing pressure to bear on us by this means. At present, even if she means to fulfil the threat conveyed in the communication under reference, we should, as will be shown ater, lose less by her so doing, than by yielding to the pressure she is bringing to bear. 1 &amp; 5. The strategic advantage to Russia and the corresponding disadvantage to us Of a direct line to Kermarf have already been discussed in Sir P Lake’s paper of 5th September 1912 (with which the Commander-in-Chief wasin complete agreement), which was laid before the Honourable Mr W H Clark s Committee on the subject of the proposed railway. ' ' ‘ In that paper it was shown that the military strength of Russia as compared with that of India was so great that if she were in a position to eielop the whole or even a large proportion of it at the front, the Army of Ind.a would be overwhelmed. As Sir Ian Hamilton told the Sub-Committee of Imperial Defence m 1907 in this connection, “ How can a no.Aonsc.int nation stand up against a conscript nation ? ” ^ ** w ? s , ter shown, in the original scheme fertile defence of India prepamd by Lord Kitchener m 1908, and examined by the Imperial General Staff and the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1907, as well' as in its further recent examination by the Indian General Staff in 1911 that the whole of the available mobile forces of India, together with such reinfoice nents as it was hoped might be contributed by Great Britain and the Dmn“ ovel- ' P 111 ? be sufficient to oppose approximately equal forces to those which Russia could, under existing conditions, deplov on the two lines of advance against Kabul and Kandahar alone. ' lines of m t* a™® i S ° demonstrated that troops could be made available from f e T Fl y t0 oppose a further Russian advance, should a third line toe t A C f .T 01116 a°? en t0 her i wlthout blueing the forces employed upon the two first named lines to a dangerous extent. t j p to ALL''' COlll r l 'A ll0pe to be able t0 s P are nl °re than perhaps 20 000 to 30,000 troops for the purpose, while, judging from previous actual performances by Russia, it was calculated that she could fairto ,»! * mamtaining at least 200,000 men at any point on such a line a the TruT- Persian Railway is intended to be. L llails3 ■issia _ the ition ; sian itive auld inds line the 1110- lear led. dar dis- dar de, rny % to nt, i, of nt ill in i at r n is 'e s a i 6. It was for this reason, viz., that we could only spare but very few troops to act on this line, that the Indian military authorities unanimously wanted the I rans-Persian Railway to be made vulnerable to our sea power by being easily accessible from the sea for as great a distance as possible foi then we could hampei the hostile advance by threatening the rear of the enemy’s force from the sea as it advanced, and, with good fortune, by cutting Rs communications If we cut them, it woidd be forced to return to restore them, or starve. If it decided to guard them so strongly as to make them safe against our attack on such a long line open to the sea, then its offensive force would be enormously reduced and we might eventually hope to meet what remained, face to face, with some prospect of success. On the othei hand, if the railway ran fai inland, we could only try to cut it fiom the sea undei great disadvantages. In fact, all the chances would lie on the enemy's side and against us. We might fairly hope that, with the line running along the sea shore from Bandar Abbas, the enemy would require 100,000 men to protect it, but with the line running inland via Kerman-Regan-Bampur to Chahbar, probably half that number would suffice, leaving 1.'.0,000 of the 200,000 mentioned above available to meet us at the front. If tlie main line, as desired by Russia, is made to pass through Kerman prolongation to the coast at or near Chahbar would follow as a matter of course, and would enable Russia to deploy an army m war time at any point on the line without our being able to interfere with the operation. In course of time, except we took steps as suggested in paragraph 9, and if no war occurred previously, the sea port on the Indian Ocean would practically become a Russian port as obviously intended from the tirst, with results both financial and moral upon the political position of India which might com pletely change the balance of power in the East, and seriously imperil our hold on this country. In war time Russia could construct a line from Kerman towards Seistan and Nushki, wdth sufficient rapidity to turn our flank at Quetta, this forcing us to form front to a flank, for which operation, as well as for an advance southwards, she would then have more than sufficient troops. These manoeuvres w r ould be rendered practically impossible if the main line led direct to Bandar Abbas. By the strong action she is now taking, Russia shows that she understands this fully, and that she is prepared to risk much to secure the strategic advantages of a direct line to Kerman, with its consequent effect on public feeling in India. 7. From what has been said in the preceding paragraphs we arrive at the conclusion, therefore, that we shall want at a low estimate 100,000 more men in the field, if the railway runs by Kerman, out of reach of our attack from the sea, than if it runs along the coast. This means that, in addition to large immediate increases to our Indian forces, we should have to call upon Great Britain and the rest of the Empire for further assistance. As we are already calculating on getting from the above sources the largest reinforcement possible at present besides drafts to replace wastage, it is evident that the bulk of the increase must come from India, probably at least 50,000 men or the equivalent of three divisions and one cavalry brigade. Moreover, Lord Kitchener estimated, and his estimate has never been seriously disputed, that we should need as a minimum nine divisions and eight cavalry brigades across the frontier to meet the advance by Kabul and Kandahar. The Army in India Committee considered that, if Russia could lie excluded from our calculations, five instead of eight cavalry brigades would suffice beyond the frontier, and also that one division more than Lord Kitchener contemplated, besides the cavalry thus set free, might have to be letained in India for internal security. Assuming the Army in India Committee calculations to be accepted, then three cavalry brigades and one division will have to be added to the 50,000 men to be provided by the Army in India as just mentioned. 8. If, therefore, access to India by a line of railway safe from interruption is to be allowed to Russia, Lidia will apparently, under the most favourable S. 215. A 2t circumstances of internal peace and unrestricted assistance from othei parts of the Empire, need the following additions to her Army lor wai • Four Cavalry Brigades (including three to replace those detailed for internal security) ; , ^ u u f Four Divisions (including one to replace the Division detailed lor internal security ; and some Army Troops. This means a total of about 60,000 fighting men, of whom, working on the accepted proportion, 24,000 would be British and the remainder Indian. This can, of course, be nothing more than a rough general estimate, but, having in view the uncertainty of the attitude of Afghanistan and the frontier tribes in such a contingency, it is more likely to be an under- than an over—estimate. The raising of the Indian portion of such an additional lorce must require consideration in view of the political factors involved, including the price of labour and the paucity of fighting races in India; and, to judge from past experience, it must inevitably take a long time to cairy a scheme of such magnitude to completion, both from the point of view of finance and of the provision of equipment and barracks. If, however, it is to be available, say eight years hence, its organization should be proceeded with at once, with the least possible delay. 9. It is also asked what other measures are advocated in the event of the Kerman alignment being adopted. In the General Staff Memorandum of 3rd January 1911 on this subject, the advisability of fortifying Bandar Abbas was urged, should this port be selected as the point at which the railway would first reach the coast. It was, however, pointed out that this might be politically impossible as it would involve the cession on lease or otherwise of the port in question. Should, however, the more dangerous alignment from Kerman to the Mekran coast be adopted, the necessity for controlling and fortifying the port at which the railway reaches the coast would be even more urgent. For this reason it would be advisable that the port should be at the mouth of the Dasht river at Gwattar rather than at Chahbar, so that no question of our right to control and fortify the port could be raised. Gwattar has also been pronounced the better port. Outside the increase to our military forces already referred to, we know of no other measures save that just mentioned which can be recommended as minimising the danger of this alignment. 10. The foregoing remarks outline the position, if w r e allow a Trans- Persian Railway to be built and aligned through Kerman. For purposes of comparison, the question K further raised :—What is the real amount of risk involved in the Russian threat to build railways in her sphere, or south from Meshed if we do not consent to the Kerman line. That when those lines were completed to Seistan or south, there would be risk cannot be doubted. Gn the other hand, such railways while within her sphere could not for some time harm us much. Presumably no railway could be built within our sphere without our consent, without constituting a direct challenge to us. If we took up that challenge then Russia would find herself at war with us with a railhead several hundred miles from our frontier, and possibly in difficult and barren country. She would not be even within one hundred miles of Seistan. Moreover, such a line would not constitute an independent line of operations, as would a direct connection from European Russia to Kerman ; and as operations to the south of Meshed, as well as any she might undertake via Herat towards the Helmand, would be dependent on the single line of rail from the Caspian Sea to Askabad, it follows that the numbers which could be supported at the two railheads would be less than were separate and independent lines of railway available. 11. In such circumstances it is doubtful whether she could deploy an appreciably greater number of men against us in front line than under present conditions. And while it may be that indications of a hostileK&amp;mmm _[Ijiis_D ocHnient is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's GoTernment.l I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the 16th June, transmitting copy of two letters from the British group of the Societe d’Etudes, with enclosures, relative to the proposed formation of two companies in respect of the trans-Persian Railway, and the consequent division of interests between the three national groups included in the Societe. With regard to the inter-group agreement and the declaration to be made by the British and Russian groups as to the rights of the French group, the Board have no observations to offer. But with regard to the draft protocol relating to the distribution of control over the various portions of the line, the Board are disposed to think that the terms of paragraph 9 are unduly wide and vague, and might be interpreted as giving the Societe d’Etudes a larger measure of control over the operations of the exploitation companies than would be compatible with the object which His Majesty’s Government had in view in proposing the formation of separate companies for the northern and southern sections of the line. Moreover, it is not made clear that the exploitation companies will be organised on the same lines as the construction companies, to which all the other articles of the draft protocol expressly relate. 1 am to suggest, therefore, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that, in the event of the British group abandoning their intention to withdraw from the Societe d’Etudes, they THE work of construction having been completed, the sub-companies formed for that purpose shall be continued as working companies, or shall be replaced by working companies constituted in the same manner. The contracts between the sub-companies and guarantee the unity of policy requisite to secure its primary object, namely, the creation of a main line of communication. PERSIA. [July 2.] CONFIDENTIAL.

According to the calculations of the commission the line from Aliata to Astara should be completed in three years, at a cost of 13,700,000 roubles (say 1,400,000b). lor this purpose the capital of the company was fixed approximately at 1,600,000 roubles nominal (say 160,000Z.) in shares, and at 14,400,000 roubles nominal (say .1,440,000b) in bonds. In view of the decision to construct the branch line, the total cost of construction will be increased to about 2,400,000 roubles (say 2,140,000b), and the nominal capital issue is now fixed at 2,500,000 roubles (say 250,000b) in shares and 22,600,000 roubles (say 2,260,000b; in bonds.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 64 of the 5 th February last and to subsequent correspondence on the subject, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translation of an aide-memoire which was handed to me yesterday by M. Sazonof, setting forth the views of the Russian Government in regard to the trans- Persian railway proposal. I had the honour to summarise the principal points of this aide-memoire in my telegram of yesterday’s date. The copy of the memorandum by M. Goukassof mentioned, as enclosed therein, is identical with the letter addressed by that gentleman to Lord Errington, copy of which was forwarded to you in my despatch No. 90 of the 18th March last, and I am consequently omitting it from this despatch. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Aide-memoire communicated to Sir G. Buchanan by M. Sazonof. THE Imperial Government have not failed to submit the aide-memoire of the British Embassy, dated the 1st (L4th) February of this year, and the documents attached to it to a careful examination, and the Russian group of the Societe d’Etudes, moreover, was invited to the consideration of the proposals which they contain. The examination in question leads to the conclusion that the British Government,., while continuing to express their sympathy in principle with the construction of a trans-Persian railway, now, however, in connection with such construction, intimate wishes which entirely change the original idea of the undertaking and raise doubts as to the possibility of its realisation both from the financial point of view and the point of view of Russian interests in Persia. The wishes of the British Government briefly- put are as follows :— 1. The question of the junction of the trans-Persian line with the railways of India to remain for the present entirely open. 2. The southern terminal point of the railway not to be any point on the littoral of the Indian Ocean, but Bunder Abbas on the Persian Gulf. 3. The direction of the line in Persia to be Astara-Resht-Tehran-Ispahan-Shiraz- Bunder Abbas, in place of the direction proposed by the Societe d’fitudes, namely, Astara- Resht-Tehran-Y ezd-Kerman-Chah bar. 4. The question of an extension of lines from Bunder Abbas in the direction ot the Baluchistan frontier not to be decided now, but to remain open. In general the British Government do not desire for the present to bind themselves by any promises with respect to railways within the limits of the British sphere of influence. 5. Both as regards the question of the construction of the railway and the question of its management the British Government differentiate between the northern and southern sections of the line, and insist that in all questions respecting the southern section England shall have a deciding voice. Moreover, under the term “southern section ” is understood the entire portion of the proposed route lying beyond rhe Russian sphere of influence, namely, the section from Ispahan through Shiraz up to Bunder Abbas. It is also stipulated that the portion of the line or its branches outside the limits of the Russian sphere shall not be built “ until and in such measures as His Majesty’s Government shall consider it politic and feasible.” [2913 t—1]2 6. The British Government notify that previous to their statement of agreement in principle to the scheme of a trans-Persian railway they had already promised their support to a group of individuals who subsequently formed the “ Persian Bail way Syndicate ” for the construction of the lines— (a.) Mohammerah-Khoremabad. (b.) Bunder Abbas-Kerman. (c.) Bushire-Aliabad and further to a certain point on the line. (d.) Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz. The British Government would wish the trans-Persian Bailway Company to come to some agreement with the above-mentioned group. The attitude of the Bussian group of the Societe d’fitudes towards the position thus taken up by the British Government is determined by the aim which this group (representing, as is known, the initiative of the whole matter) set itself from the very commencement. This aim is the creation of a transit route through Bussia and Persia between Europe on the one side and India and Australasia on the other. In the pursuance of this aim those responsible for the enterprise have become in a manner competitors of the Bagdad Bailway. The basis of this competition consists in (1) a firm conviction that the shortest and most suitable communication between Europe and India is across southern Bussia and not through Turkey ; and (2) a desire that Bussia shall take advantage of her natural superiority in this respect before the reahsation of the Bagdad line makes it difficult to do so. Again, the group had in view also the necessity of railways for Persia herself, even though it is at first glance clear that local traffic only cannot justify the cost of construction of such lines. It is for this reason also that the initiators, as is known, selected the route (within Persia) Astara-Besht-Tehran-Yezd-Kerman-Chahbar. This route, which is the shortest, has also the further advantage that it intersects the most populated and productive provinces of Persia and emerges at a sole coastal point of Southern Persia capable of being converted into a good port. Turning next to a detailed consideration of the wishes of the British Government under the points specified it must be noted as follows :—• 1. In consideration of the special views still prevalent in Anglo-Indian political circles the Bussian group finds it possible to agree to this point, being firmly convinced that the junction of the trans-Persian railway, once it is completed, with the Indian railway system will be naturally effected in the course of time. 2. Bunder Abbas, as the terminal point for a large transit port, is inacceptable. In the copy of a memorandum (enclosed herewith) by M. Goukassof, one of the members o the Bussian group, drawn up on the basis of authoritative English sources, it is shown that Bunder Abbas cannot be converted into a suitable port without very great expenditure. Along the entire southern shore of Persia there is not a single point further west than Chahbar which could be converted into a suitable port. The other point—Guattar—m to the east of Ohahbar on the Perso-Baluchistan frontier. It won appear that Persia has a right to expect that no interdict shall be placed on her one decent harbour. 3. An alteration in the direction of the line as wished by the British Govern- lengthen the main line by approximately 350 versts ; a w-ii mcre£ f e l fcs cost of construction approximately by 50,000,000 roubles ; [ C 'J 1 S lea,: .) decrease the transit importance of the line for European and Bussian passengers and goods traffic ; and (d) Will reduce the importance of the line for Persia herself, as it will leave on «»ne side the populated provinces of Kerman and Yezd in favour of the less populated an ess pro uc ive province of Shiraz, and the absolutely uninhabited and unproductive mountainous provinces m the south. r Apart from this the Russian Government, from the point of view of their own economic interests, have already repeatedly expressed themselves opposed to the construction in Persia of meridional railways terminating on the Persian Gulf. 'p 1 y* aS p il s a lea y been repeatedly pointed out, it would approximate the Trans-Persian Railway towards the Bagdad line, which would lead m time to the diveiling of a part of the traffic to the latter. r&gt; , t S Te l alds e y en «io» of the line from Bunder Abbas in the direction of Baluchistan, the question is not worth discussion, as the Russian group in general mentcannot agree to Bunder Abbas as a terminal, even if temnorarv noint nf +V, •, To take the Ime to Bunder Abbas even if assured of the pos^iLity in the fntureof its subsequent extension to Chahbar, does not appear expedient aR q Lk , ,] travel for a distance of 600 versts along the absolutely tn\oast of th^ aTf of , • n&lt; ? i . 1S shown l, .- ) he the natural terminus, there are no grounds for approaching it by a circuitous route in place of direct from Kerman. S 6. Taking into consideration the international character of the enterprise and equally the fact that the portion of the line mentioned in this point would not traverse the British but the neutral /.one, it appears just and necessary that no one group of the company shall enjoy therein any preferential rights, ancf that influence and right of vote shall be divided to an absolutely equal degree between all three groifps Moreover, considering it extremely desirable to submit questions respecting the construction of railways in the neutral zone to mutual consideration, for the sake o, a possible agreement of respective interests, the Imperial Government have already notified the .Russian group that an extension of the Trans-Persian line beyond the limits of the Kussian sphere cannot be realised previous to the conclusion of negotiations on this matter between the two Governments interested. 6. The Imperial Government and the Russian group of the Societe d’Etudes were not aware that previous to the raising of the question of the construction of the Trans-Persian line, the British Government were already bound by a promise of support for the Persian Railway Syndicate. For their own part, the Imperial Government would not have objected, but would have even regarded the fusion of these two companies desirable. However, from information in'their possession, the international groups constituting the Societe d'Rtudes apparently regard the Persian Railway Syndicate as not sufficiently stable from a financial point of view, and therefore, as it appeals, would not effect the amalgamation specified with any particular eagerness. With respect to the railways specified by the syndicate, it must be noted that the line Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz is absolutely unnecessary to Persia, and has not any significance for local trade. It would appear that similarly it cannot have any importance for British trade, as it is quite devoid of a character of a line of penetration. It would run through an unpopulated and mountainous locality almost parallel with the coast line at no great distance from it, and would connect two points, communication between which could be easily maintained by water. The endeavour of . the syndicate to effect a realisation of this line can have only one interpretation : this line must form subsequently one of the links of a railway which will connect the Bagdad Railway with India. It is sufficient to cast a glance at the map to be convinced of this. If the syndicate succeeds in obtaining a concession for this line, there will be danger of the subsequent formation of a combination resembling the well-known agreement between the shipping company of Lynch and the German Bank. In view of these considerations, the Imperial Government cannot but be averse to the line in question While having no objections against the other railways proposed (of which the line Mohammerah-Khoremabad is already guaranteed by an option), the Imperial Government, in accordance with the opinion of the Russian group of the Societe d’Etudes, imagine that at any rate the Trans-Persian Railway could be linked up with the line Chahbar-Regan-Bali-Kerman, if this latter line is constructed by the Syndicate of Persian Railways. Finally, the Imperial Government consider it necessary again to note that they cannot agree with the known endeavour of the syndicate in question to secure for itself the right to construct almost all the railways in the neutral zone. That this is the aim of the syndicate is clearly seen in the projected agreement with the Persian Government as drawn up by the syndicate. This fact has alreadv been the subject of personal explanations between M. Sazonof and Sir E. Grey. The Russian Government regard it as unquestionably necessary to guarantee for Russians undertaking enterprises, even if in company with international groups, a similar right to railway construction in the zone specified, and in particular mention the following lines :— 1 1. Ispahan-Shiraz. 2. Ispahan-Ahwaz. 3. Yezd-Kerman. 4. Yezd-Shiraz. 5. Ispahan-Khoremabad.4 In conclusion, the Imperial Government consider it their duty to note that the Russian group of the Societe d’fitudes regards the realisation of the trans-Persian Railway Lng the route specified by the British Government will involve from the financial point of view, difficulties so great as to border on the impossible. The named has intimated that under such conditions the whole enterprise of a Persian Railway threatens to fall to pieces or to assume an entirely different character namely the construction of special Russian lines of penetration m the Russian and neutral zone, of course, with a preponderating Russian influence. With reference to point 3 of the aide-memoire of the British Embassy of the 2nd (15th) May, 1911, the Russian Government m the event of the realisation of the proiect of a trans-Persian line in accordance with the wishes of the Societe d Etudes and upon the condition of reciprocity, are prepared not to permit railway con struction within the limits of the Russian zone and the neutral zone near the Perso-Afe-han frontier without a preliminary agreement on the subject with the British Government. , ^ In addition, and on similar conditions, the Russian Government recognise the correctness of the desire expressed by the London Cabinet that equality for British and Indo-British trade shall be established both on the main trans-Persian line and on its branches.

By the document drawn up at Balmoral on 27th September 1912 by onsieur Sazonow, it was suggested that an agreement should be made between the Russian and British groups whereby rights within the British sphere of influence in Persia should be duly safe guarded. The draft of such an agreement was forwarded to the foreign Office on 20th December 1912, and after an additional declaration had been asked for by the rench group the text of the letter was submitted to the foreign Office on 15th January 1913. On 24th February 1913 the Foreign Office expressed a wish that any declaration of the nature proposed should be so worded as to make it clear that the rights of the French group referred to therein meant the right to one-third share of the capital and not 'he Under Secretary of State, foreign Office.not to absolute equality with the other two partici pating countries. Of this the French group were i duly informed. They in turn disclaimed the desire to advance any political interests by their partici- j Potion in the Societe’s activities, but they claimed to be entitled to treatment on an equal footing with the Russian and British elements in regard to economic, financial and technical matters. When the British group are advised of the latest views of the Foreign Office in regard to the affairs of the Societe d'Etudes, a meeting will be held in P aris at which the British group will be called upon to make their position clear and their final assent will be asked to the enclosed document embodying the inter-group agreements, which are understood to have already received the assent of the Russian Government. The next Paris meeting, which it is hoped to convene early in June, will therefore probably be of great importance in deciding the many questions at issue between Russian, British and French interests in Persia. The Russian and French groups have expressexpressed a strong hope that, in view of the British Government’s approval of the formation of the Bociete d'Etudes and their tacit assent to the Gociete's statutes, they will agree to the texts of the docu ments as now submitted. Whatever decision may be arrived at by His Majesty’s Government, the British group recognise that they can no longer postpone action, and that if the Foreign Office do not see their way to grant them the full information and support v/hich the Bociete requires to carry out the objects for v/hich it was formed, they will have no choice but to dissolve partnership with their French and Russian associates, and retire from a position which, if persisted in, would place them at a disad vantage for obtaining practical results in Persia.

It is suggested that a reply to that note should be drawn up in this Department stating the reasons for thinking it desirable to defer the question of alignment in the neutral and British spheres until a joint commission has examined and reported upon the two routes. - 1 - t ]\/r Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 14th May regarding the Trans-Persian Railway. The committee was attended by the following:— On behalf of the Foreign Office by Sir A. Nicolson and Sir L. Mallet; the India Office by Sir A. Hirtzel; the Board of Trade by Sir H. Llewellyn Smithy the War Office by General Wilson; and the Admiralty by Captain Ballard. Sir George Buchanan, His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, was also present. The attention of the Inter-Departmental Committee was in ttm first place drawn to the two last paragraphs but one of the Russian memorandum, which state that the Russian Government considered it their duty to note that the Russian group of the Societd d’Etudes considers that the realisation of the Trans-Persian Railway along the route specified by the British Government would involve, from a financial point of view, difficulties so great as to border on the impossible. The Russian group intimated that under such conditions the whole enterprise of the Trans-Persian Railway threatens to fall to pieces or to assume an entirely different character, namely, the construction of special lines of penetration in the Russian and neutral zones with a preponderating Russian influence. Further, the Russian Government state that, in the event of the realisation of the project of a Trans-Persian line in accordance with the wishes of the Societe d’Etudes, they would be prepared not to permit railway construction within the limits of the Russian zone and the neutral zone near the Perso-Afghan frontier without a preliminary agreement on the subject with the British Government. The deductions, therefore, which should be drawn from the above statements would be :— That if the Trans-Persian Railway project was not carried out— 1. The Russian group would feel at liberty to construct Russian lines both in the L. M. June 13, 1913. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. AN Inter-Departmental Committee met to-day at the Foreign Office in order to examine the memorandum communicated to Sir George Buchanan by the Russian Russian and neutral zones with a preponderating Russian influence ; and B2. ihat the Russian Government would permit railway construction within the limits of the Russian zone and the neutral zone near the Perso-Afcdian frontier. This attitude, if maintained by the Russian Government, would mean that co-operation between Russia and England, so far as railway enterprise was concerned in Persia, would practically be at an end, and that Great Britain would not be in a position to have a voice in or to guide railway construction in the Russian sphere, and would also experience great difficulty in opposing Russian railway construction in the neutral zone. It is, moreover, quite possible that such construction would be dangerous to British interests, both from the strategical and political points of view. It seems therefore, desirable to see if it would not be possible to keep alive the Societd d’Etudes' and thereby ensure that co-operation between Russia and England in regard to railway enterprise in Persia should be continued and placed on a satisfactory basis. In the memorandum communicated to Russia on the 14th February of this year the British Government stated that the question of the linking-up of the Trans- Persian Railway with the railways of India should remain for the present entirely open. To this the Russian Government reply that, “ In consideration of the special views still prevalent in Anglo-Indian political circles, the Russian Government find it possible to agree to this point.” This reply, therefore, meets the British views, and in any case defers the necessity of seriously considering a junction between the Persian and Indian railway systems for some time to come. The second desideratum of the British Government was that the southern terminal point of the railway should be Bunder Abbas on the Persian Gulf. To this the Russian Government reply that Bunder Abbas as a terminal point is unacceptable, and suggest that either Chahbar or Guattar would be more suitable and convenient ports. The information in the possession _ of the Admiralty is to the effect that neither of these ports could possibly be made into convenient ports of call or serve as terminal ports of the railway without enormous expenditure of money. There is, however, an anchorage about 25 miles to the west of Bunder Abbas which affords every convenience for embarking and landing merchandise and passengers. This is in the Clarence Straits which are at this point completely sheltered in all seasons, affording a good harbour where steamers of any size could discharge and embark goods either alongside jetties for the construction of which the locality is suitable, or by lighterage, which would be much less difficult than at Chahbar or Guattar. It is considered that if it were pointed out to the Russian Government that the only really suitable port is in the Clarence Straits they could not insist upon the roadsteads which they have mentioned as being ocahties which could be advantageously made use of for the purposes required. Our consent to the line proceeding to Kerman might be made conditional on Clarence Straits being included in the British sphere. i fV 1 * 1 Bri ^ lsil desideratum was that the alignment of the future railway C i f 3 ! Viw! 1 .’ s Pf ia , n ’ Shiraz, and Bunder Abbas, while the Russians desire that 1 + S1 fi U + n &lt; f? a ’ lverman 5 ar &gt;d Chahbar. I he Bussian memorandum points out that the British alignment would considerably lengthen the main line, would entail increased cost of construction of over 5,000,000/. and greatly decrease the transit importance of the line, and would leave on one side the populated provinces of Kerman and Yezd. r r r i • ^ n ^f l d^paf^ental Committee were fully aware of the military objections vluch have been raised to the Yezd-Kerman route. Supposing, nevertheless, that ussians were to concentrate within four months a large body of troops at Kerman, it does not seem very clear how they would utilise this force, even on the assumption that a railway was m existence between Kerman and the southern coast. Uiere would be no reason for their proceeding to the coast, where they could effect nothing, and to march eastwards across the desert would present great difficulties. R ap - peai&gt;S t iat H ! s Ma jestys Government have no effective means of Z7 e ^ the a rai ! W ^ Kerman witho ^ their co-operation, n&lt; t -V C ;: nilr 'i ttee submit that the military aspects of the whole situation require ieconsideration horn is point of view Subject to the result of this reconsideration, it appears to the Committee that as the Russian Government are ready to make a r“rYT' d \ n^u^ 811 desideratum, and, as there is considerable force m the objections which they have raised to the British alignment, the alignment Tezd Kerman to the coas. westofjffinder Abbas could be accepted without incurring any leal risk to British mterejmCp^^ that it is clearly understood that railway construction would be commenced from the coast northwards to Kerman simultaneouslywith the construction of the section in the Russian sphere. Tins stipulation is one to which the Board of Trade attach importance from the commercial point of view. As regards the fourth British desideratum, respecting the extension of the line from Bunder Abbas eastwards, the Russian memorandum states that the question is not ^orth discussion. The views advanced on both sides regarding this point are naturally superseded, at any rate for the present, as the Russian Government agree that the junction with the Indian railways should be left open. _ r* i As regards the railways in the neutral zone, touched upon in point No. 5 of the memorandum, this is a matter for further consideration between the two Governments. The whole case of the Trans-Persian Railway may perhaps be summed up as follows:— The Russian Government are willing to suspend the question of a junction between the trans-Persian line and the Indian railway system, and, so far as can be gathered, they would be willing to co-operate with the British Government in a line throng i Persia connecting Yezd and Kerman with a port on the southern coast, and a so to discuss with them the question of railways in the neutral zone. There seems to be, however, little doubt that, if the British Government decline to entertain the alignment of Yezd and Kerman, as proposed by the Russian Govern ment, and to continue to insist upon the Ispahan-Shiraz route, the Russian Government would consider that the whole question of co-operation must be abandoned, and Russia would then have complete liberty of action to construct any lines which she may consider desirable Such lines, especially that constructed near the Perso- g an frontier, could not be viewed with equanimity by the British Government, who be powerless to prevent their construction, and instead of a cordial and friendly co-operation in railway enterprise there would be constant causes of friction between the two Governments, which, indeed, might seriously impair their relations. _ co-operation can be secured by consent to the alignment proposed by the Government, and if thereby the Societe d’Etudes can be kept alive, the Bntis Government would be able to have some voice in the construction of railways even within the Russian sphere. It would therefore seem desirable that a reply should be sent to the Russian memorandum so as to enable further discussion and consultation to continue. . , , In arriving at the above conclusions the Committee were influenced mainly by considerations of a political or strategical order. They do not wish to be understood m any way to countenance the view that a Trans-Persian Railway with the proposed alignment would be likely to be a financially attractive proposition without subsidy or guarantee of some kind. Foreign Office, May 29, 1913. Annex 1. Dear Sir Arthur Nicolson, Office, June 3, IJlo. I AM in rather a difficulty about signing the draft report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Trans-Persian Railway at present, because Lord Crewe lias telegraphed to the Viceroy for the definite views of the military authorities on e situation that will be created if the main line goes to Kerman; and until they ave been received and considered it seems useless for me to commit myself. a t i In tbe meantime, may I make one or two remarks on the general position . Apar from the question of Kerman, I shall sign the report with the utmost reluctance because 1 am not satisfied that our diplomatic resources have been anything like exhausted m defence of the proposals we have made to Russia. On the contrary, we seem rather to be in the position of knocking down the walls of our own Jericho the v ® r y hQ-dmen re Russian trumpet sounds. I admit that it sounds loudly : but wha oes i a amount to ? -r* • -d u We are told that if we do not come to terms over the Trans-Persian Railway we must expect to see Russian lines penetrating the neutral sphere, with prepon era mg Russian influence, and a Russian railway along the Afghan frontier, nut these rea s —if threats they are—must be examined in the light of the following facts . 1. That before Russia can penetrate the neutral zone she has, as a matter o V1 a necessity, to find capital to construct (a) a line from her frontier to Tehran, (o) ie Khanikin-Tehran line, in order to save it from the Germans. 2. That the Duma will not vote money for unproductive railways. [2948 rc—2] B 2it .British or -trench capital are not forthcomino-, where is the money coming from? and even if French capital is forthcoming for the tw r o lines to Tehran, how loner will it be before Russia will have found more capital to extend thence to the limits of^ier own sphere—much less to penetrate the neutral sphere ? and is it to be assumed that there will be no British penetration of the neutral sphere, with predominant British influence* in the meantime ? But, it will be said, on this hypothesis all idea of co-operation with Russia in Persia disappears. I am entirely in favour of our co-operating with Russia, but not necessarily in the capacity of nether millstone. Co-operation implies a certain community of interests, and if two parties are to co-operate in the ordinary affairs of life each must bring something to the common stock, or each must be satisfied that he will gain something by it. That, however, is very far from being the position in which we find ourselves as regards this scheme: We are simply asked to “ stand and deliver and not our money only, but also (if the extreme military view is sound) our lives. Now,^ it is possible to find railway construction in Persia in which we can co-operate with Russia on far more equal terms. Supposing that the Bunder Abbas- Shiraz-lspahan-Tehran line is commercially hopeless (which I do not admit) there is the Julfa-Mohamrnerah line, which is greatly to our interest, and by which we can do no more harm to Russia than by the other line, while the combined competition of Russia and ourselves should be fatal to the extension of German trade and influence in orthern and Western Persia. The India Office have pressed this officially, and at the time of the -Defence Committee discussions in January last I ventured to write to Sir K Grev about it Since then I have urged it on Sir W. Bisset (one of the British group ot the Societe), and it has now been proposed as an alternative by Mr. F C -Ramson m paragjaph 4 of his memorandum of the 20th May (copy enclosed) I would invite especial reference to the argument in paragraph 5 of it: ££ We hold the purse strings.

That proposal, however, could be defended as offering what we considered the most practical solution of the question of alignment, and did not, as would be the case were Sir A. Hirtzefs suggestion adopted, shut the door for ever on the realisation of the Trans-Persian ^ TtV tTbe regretted that Sir A. Hirtzel did not communicate his proposal to jRe Inter-Departmental Committee that met on the 29th May, as I earned away from that meeting the impression that the majority of those present were in favour of the alignment Tehran-Yezd-Kerman, with a terminal port at a point 8ome\ 20 miles to the west of Bunder Abbas. The Indian Government, if I am not mistaken, have admitted the commercial advantages of this alignment, but contend that they are outweighed by its strategical disadvantages. It is not foi a layman like myself to express an opinion on the strategical side of the question, but I may be permitted to state my personal conviction that, if we refuse to co-operate with Russia in the construction of this line, the Russians will sooner or later build it themselves. All that we can hope to gain by our abstention is to delay the construc tion for a few years, but such delay will be dearly bought. It will then no longer be a question of Anglo-Russian co-operation in a great railway enterprise that may serve to strengthen the good understanding now existing between the two countries. ^ Such co-operation will have to give place to separate and independent action by Prussia that will inevitably lead to friction and misunderstandings. Russia will then consider herself free to consult her own interests, without any regard for ours, and will, when the time comes, not only build a line from Yezd to Kerman, but also construct others near the Perso-Afghan frontier. The financial difficulties to which Sir A. Hirtzel alludes in his letter are not insuperable, and, if Russia makes up her mind to build these railways she will, somehow or other, find the necessary funds. A close understanding with Russia is of such vital importance to us that it would, in my opinion, be a fatal mistake to adopt an attitude that must lead to the dissolution of the Comite d’Etudes and to the abandonment of Anglo-Russian co-operation in rail way enterprise in Persia. The dangers attending such a course are likely to^ be far more serious than the risk attaching to the joint construction of the proposed Tehran- Yezd-Kerman Railway. Nobody, I presume, supposes that Russia at present harbours any aggressive designs on India. Whether she will do so or not m some distant futuie does not really affect the question under consideration, as the construction of the proposed railway cannot be indefinitely postponed. It must, moreover, be lemembered that nearly all the Russian supporters of the Trans-Persian Railway scheme are our best friends. The Emperor himself is interested in it ; the Government have given it their support; and many of its original promoters are, like MM. Khomiakoff and Zvegintzef, the most ardent advocates of an Anglo-Russian understanding. It would be ridiculous to impute to them the Machiavellian design of forging a weapon for a Russian attack on India. They hope, on the contrary, that the projected railway wil serve to draw the two countries still closer together, while they believe that it will promote Russian interests by acting as a counterpoise to ^ the Bagdad Railway. Some of them also, who are opposed to a forward policy in Persia, see in it the best guarantee for the maintenance of Persian integrity, _ T , ^ _ -u r In a conversation, which I had with him the day before I left bt, Peteisbuigh, M. Kokoutzof declared that whatever might happen ^ in the next twenty years no Russian Government would ever entertain the idea of an invasion of India. Russia, he said, had to be on her guard on her western frontier against Austria^ and Germany ; she had to keep her eye on Turkey; she had to look after her interests in the I ar Easp and, if one day she entered on a policy of expansion, it would be in the direction of Northern Manchuria and not of India. _ . . Whichever course we ciclopt—whether coll&amp;borcitioii with itussici or cibs tent ion— must be attended with a certain amount of risk ; but I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that the former is the less dangerous of the two. I am therefore personally in favour of informing the Russian Government that we are prepared to accept the alignment Tehran—T ezd-Kerman, witn a terminal point some 20 miles to the west of Bunder Abbas, and of suggesting to them that, until such time as public opinion in this country is ripe for the extension of the railway to the Indian frontier, communication with India should be maintained by means of steamers running between the terminal port and Kurrachee. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. London, June 7, 1913.From Secretai'y of State to Viceroy, 29th May 1913, Private. Your Secret Despatch No. 11 of 13th February. Trans-Persian Railway. Please let me have your personal views on question of alignment as soon as possible. Also whether if main line is taken to Kerman, military authorities consider that immediate increase of army or other measures will be necessary, and if so what. Russia has made it clear that if Kerman is not included the scheme will break down altogether, and she will consider herself free to build as she pleases, including eventually line to Meshed and southwards. Whether this risk is worth taking must depend partly on immediate measures which inclusion of Kerman would necessitate. From Viceroy, 10th June 1913. Private. Your private telegram of 29th ultimo. Trans-Persian Railway. My personal view has always been that if the railway is to be constructed at all the natural and most advantageous alignment for commercial and general purposes would be via Kerman and Chahbar, or Gwettar. ^ The latter is the better po$t. The military authorities have persistently objected to the line passing through Kerman, and although I regard their objections as unduly exaggerated, I do not care to assume the responsibility of rejecting them. That a Trans-Persian Railway will be built sooner or later is perfectly obvious since India cannot remain indefinitely in a position of complete isolation, especially as her commerce and industries grow, and the need for very rapid communication with Europe becomes accentuated. If the scheme breaks down and the Russians start building a line to Meshed the Amir will become alarmed and give trouble. This we may have to put up with and make the best of, but if the Russians prolong the railway southwards from Meshed we can only regard it as a hostile demonstration against India or against our ally the Amir. I cannot conceive that they have the slightest intention of doing anything of the kind either now or in the near future, and merely make that reservation on account of condition imposed in our Despatch of 23rd February 1911, of which contents were presumably communicated to them. In considering this question^ it must not be forgotten that there is nothing to prevent the Russian Government building to-morrow a line to Kerman. What has always struck me as the most difficult side of this question is where the money to build the railway and to cover the annual deficit between receipts and operating expenses is to come from. This issue alone will, I believe, indefinitely delay the building of the line. In reply to my enquiry as to what immediate measures would be necessi tated by inclusion of Kerman the Commander-in-Chief informs me to agree to the alignment of the main line through Kerman would involve at least an addition of four cavalry brigades and four divisions, with some army troops, thus making an addition of 60,000 men, of whom 24,000 would be Biitish, as well as further demands upon United Kingdom and the rest of the Empire for assistance in the event of war. I am naturally unable to express an opinion upon these figures, but 1 am able to state that finances of this country are quite unequal to bearing such an intolerable burden as this addition would entail. _ n i I am sending you by mail a memorandum by the Chief of the GeneiaJ Staff on the subject. There is much in it with which I do not agree.! s mmjmm by captain vilson a domnsmoN vim Mr. CECIL BARING AND LCRP ERRIN^ 12th 191 A. I called at 8 Bishopsgata by request, and after explaining my position stated that I had seen in Reuters' that the Russian Government were in favour of the Yezd-Kaman-Charter alignment (called YKC below) whilst Bis Majesty's Government favoured the Ispahan- Shiraz-Bandar Abbas alignment (called ISB/A below). I said that I had been over ISB/A ana had studiea YKC from the official records and information ^available at Bush ire,and that my pe conclusion that a Tehran-ISB/A alignment would be commercially profitable in itself, apart from international traffic: if there fore it was constructed, and the prolongation to India not effected, it would still be commercially sound, and if the prolongation were ultimately made, the international traffic would only have to bear the cost of the Bandar Abbas-Karachi section. If, on the other hand, the YKC line were adopted, I believed that the local traffic that would be devel- ^deficient rain- oped would be so small, (for reasons statea) ck Depopulat ion that it could never pay its way unless prolonged to Karachi and even if prolonged, 1 greatly doubted if it would pay, as the international traffic would have to bear the greater paBt of the cost of the line. I gave details of the population in the provinces within 50 miles of either alignment, which are roughly as follows-’- Isfahan 500,000 Yazd 100,000 Shiraz (^ars) 255,000 Kaman 125,000 P.Abhas (say) 30,000 (Jharbar 5,000 785,000 230,000(y*y I pointed out that statistics of rainfall indicated heavier rainfall in Shiraz and Isfahan provinces than in Yazd and Kaman, and that the production of bulk exports from the former two places was necessarily much greater than from the latter* As regards the relative merits of Bandar Abbas and Charbar I represented that there were various reasons for thinking that sufficient facilities could be provided at Bandar Abbas to meet all practical purposes, at a moderate cost 9 and that any attempt to create a port at Charbar 9 even though the natural facilities were somewhat greater 9 was likely tv be unsuccessful, as in the case of Dalny, which was unable to compete with the old-established port of Newchwang . Mr* Baring said that the above information was wholly new to him and threw a new light on the matter* Ns did not appear to be aware of the views of the Russian group as described in the Note of May 1*4th, and he believed that the Russian group wars honestly ready to fall in with any alternative alignment proposed by His Majesty 9 s Government, if only they were assured of support in pushing the railway along that alignment* Mr* Baring seid he was not a little discouraged at the turn things were taking and that the Indian group wanted to withdraw altogether from participation* He did not think the Societe d 9 Mtudes would be willing to incur the expense of sending a Gomnission to investigate the merits of various alignments in the South, unless His Majesty's Government could give them some ass i ranee that the money would not be wasted* (Signed) A.

I would invite especial reference tothe argvm&amp;nt in para. 5 of it:- 'We hold the purse-strings. Russia wants finanoial assistance.' In my opinion, whatever the ultimate military view about Kerman may be, His Majesty's Government will be taking upon themselves a very heavy responsibility if they admit the Trans-Persian line to the British sphere at that point, until every possible alternative has been exhausted. I know that Russia has on former occasions refused to consider the Julfa-Mohammera line. But circumstances are now very different and I venture to urge that a serious tttempt should be made to get the scheme as suggested by Mr. Harrison carried. Yours very truly, (Signed) A. Hirtzel. I am aware that the Russian aide-memoire says that meridional railways are inconsistent with Russian economic interests, but as the difference between Bunder Abbas and, Chahbar is apparently enough to get over that difficulty it is obvious that it is largely a fictitious one.[This Document is tli6 Froporty of His Britannic Majesty s Governnieiit.] [B] PERSIA Confidential. [23412] [May 22.] Section 1. Mr. Harrison to Sir W. Langley.—(Received May 22.) Dear Sir W.

Sabbine. After next week I expect to be away in Canada, salmon fishing, until August. If, therefore, you wish to communicate with me further, perhaps vou would do so eariy next week. r 1 ^ Yours, &amp;c. TT P. TT A 'RTJ.T^ON Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. THERE are, I fear, weighty objections to the plan suggested by M. Sabbine. The moneys requisite could not be obtained from the market Financial houses forecas the employment of their resources very closely. Unlike Governments, they cannot enoao-e to' provide considerable sums in driblets at indefinite periods. It may be objected that this is not expected of them, that their position at the moment of a financial operation is that of the midwife, or, at worst of the monJily nurse, but the public m their turn would not find the money. They would not be attracted by a 1 procession of small loans, each of which would be secured worse than its nredecessor. Moreover, the flotation would be more expensive for Persia. the trouble and expense and responsibility of issuing several loans successively is considerably greater than what is involved in one operation undertaken au a moment These preliminary objections are, I think, fatal. It is, moreover very desirable to raise at once a considerable sum. There are Russian, English, and drench (Creusot &amp; Bill) claims to be satisfied which can only be scaled with advantage if dealt with en bloc. Similarly the problem of the pension list has to be faced comprehensive y. is also imperative to pay off and discontinue the present Russian floating debt. At present Persia borrows short loans on usurious terms and immediately starts repaying capital and interest from the customs revenues, which could just as easily (and tar more economically) be employed in meeting its expenditure direct. So soon as it is recognised that the amount to be borrowed must be considerable, it is also clear that the whole debt should be consolidated. The investing public would very properly attach much importance to the fact that their Jien was subject to no prior encumbrance, and extended without reservation to definite Persian revenues The mention of northern and southern customs houses, Russian, neutral, and Br t zones perplex and perturb a market already distrustful. It may be argued that t is is all Very fine, but why should Russia give up its prior hen on the more productive northerif customs houses ? To this there is an effective rejoinder The largest part of the Russian debt is not at present a negotiable security. It would immediately become one on consolidation. If this view be not accepted, an unanswerable reply to discharge the whole of this debt with the proceeds of the new loan. 2 r l would, however, respectfully demur to the ideas underlying M. Sabbine s suggestions. You speak in your letter of a scheme “based upon development of the projects already inaugurated under the auspices of foreigners.' A country living on borrowed money doled out at uncertain intervals cannot build or guarantee railways, or, [2913 y 1]2 indeed, progress in any direction except down hill. The only hope for Persia is for it to pay its own way out of the resources of its own people. I will not repeat here what I have said in the memorandum I wrote for Messrs. Baring Brothers and Co., of which you have a copy, but would ask that it and the scheme for control jointly elaborated bv M. Bizot, M. Baffalovich, and myself be read in conjunction with this letter. If PersiA is to be preserved, this can only be effected by drastic financial control. I gather that, in Sir Edward Grey’s opinion, it would be very difficult to obtain Persia’s consent to tight leading-strings. Yet it could be pointed out to its patriots, it they exist, that herein lies Persia’s only hope of salvation. 3: Now that His Majesty’s Government have definitely vetoed the project for a great trans-continental railway, it is difficult to see how the Societe d’Etudes’ life can be prolonged with advantage to its members. With its demise the tie between Russian and English interests is weakened. German shortly obtains under the Potsdam Agree ment access to Tehran, and Russia will gradually build as far as Yezd, awaiting an opportunity, in its slow tenacious manner, to reach the sea via Kerman. The network of railways running north and east and west will suck the entire trade in these directions, and the Gulf line from Mohammerah to Khoremabad will be debarred access to the Russo-German chord and the northern system. Those who think that Russia, when the projects of the Societe d’Etudes are definitely abandoned, will look on complacently whilst purely British interests cover the south and neutral spheres with a network of railways, according to the grandiose conceptions of Mr. Green way, are sanguine. 4. Speaking entirely for myself, and on the assumption that His Majesty’s Govern ment will not reconsider their decision in regard to the international scheme for the further- ance of which the societe was constituted, I would submit for consideration the following policy:— (1.) Construct the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway, prolonging it by inter national agreement through Hamadan to Kazvin (with a branch to the Caspian), whence it will run via Zindjan and Tabriz to Julfa. (2.) Open the roads from the Gulf to Shiraz, Yezd, and Kerman. (3.) Lend Persia money on the lines foreshadowed in my memorandum and the project of control put forward by my French and Russian colleagues and myself. The advantages of (1) are— (a.) The line projected should pay ; (b.) It holds Persia together, instead of accentuating the disintegration setting in on the lines of the Anglo-Russian agreement. (c.) It allows our cotton and our tea, and our trade generally, an equal chance of competing with Russian imports, since construction proceeds concurrentlv from the north and south. The advantages of (2) are that we are not attempting the impossible. Financial reform with the revenues derived from loan funds in the first instance should render this modest programme feasible. An incidental advantage of (3), as against M. Sabbine’s scheme, is that it permits of the survival (in an altered form, perhaps) of the societe, even if the trunk hne now suggested is not constructed. The body in Paris would have little to do. Its existence would, however, be agreeable to French susceptibilities, which must be taken into account if recourse be had to the Pans market. The real spade work would be done in Persia by the Council of Administration. 5. The first criticism of this policy that suggests itself is that Russia will never agree. Russia is intensely opposed to the linking-up northwards of the Mohammerah line for trade reasons.^ We, of course, cannot admit the validity of this argument, except under compulsion, and Russia does not wish to see Persia rehabilitated. On the other hand, we hold the purse strings. Russia wants financial assistance. To secure her assent, I would point out that England will not, except under these conditions, find the money for Persia and its railways. As an additional incentive, His Majesty s Government might agree to support the extension, of the railways from Kasvin to Yezd (a branch diverging north of Yezd to Ispahan), it being stipulated that when, if ever, the line enters the neutral sphere, the English partici pation should preponderate south of Yezd to the same extent as the Russian interest preponderates north of Yezd.I am quite aware that military opinion dislikes the approach of the railway to Yezd. On the other hand, it is surely better to accept what cannot be prevented. We are at a great disadvantage in Persia, and can only make the best of a bad job. 6. In conclusion, I would like to make two points quite clear. In making the ggestion regarding the Mohammerah Railway, I am not speaking on behalf of the societe, but merely in my personal capacity. The British group has not examined or even discussed the Mohammerah alignment. To avoid all possible misconception, I would like to add, on my own part, that I have no financial interest in the Societe d’Etudes, to which I belong as an adjoint, and that a prolonged residence in Persia has no attractions for me whatsoever.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter of the 18th April, transmitting copy of a despatch from His Majesty s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh and of letters from the British group of the Societe d’Etudes relative to the alignment of the proposed trans-Persian railway and the suggested division of that enterprise between two companies, which should be under Russian and British control respectively. With regard thereto 1 am to state, for Sir E. Grey’s information, that, whilst the scheme for the division of interests appears to be not unacceptable in principle if the other questions at issue were satisfactorily settled, the Board doubt if any useful purpose would be served by discussing the scheme in any detail at the present moment, since it is evident that the requirements of His Majesty’s Government as to the Ispahan-Shiraz-Bunder Abbas alignment are not such as either the council of the Societe d’Etudes or the members of the British group are disposed to accept. I am to add that the Board concur in Sir E. Grey’s opinion that, in the event of any scheme being ultimately agreed on, the point of demarcation between the northern and southern sections should be as close to the border of the Russian sphere as possible, and they would recommend that an endeavour should be made to place it at Ispahan.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received March 25.) (No. 90.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, March 18, 1913. M. SAZONOF gave me last week a letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, that M. Goukassof, one of the Russian representatives of the Societe d’Etudes, had addressed to Lord Errington on the subject of the alignment of the proposed Trans- Persian Railway. His Excellency at the same time remarked that the facts and figures cited by M. Goukassof were all derived from British sources. I replied that this might be so, but that we had from the outset vetoed the proposal of the line passing through Kerman and Bampur. His Excellency had been too occupied with other matters to resume the discussion of our latest proposals. They are, however, being examined by the Russian promoters of the railway scheme, who, according to what M. Poklewsky told me, as reported in my telegram No. 83 of the 11th instant, have been very unfavourably impressed by them. He doubted very much if they would ever accept them, and considered that they would in any case make their acceptance conditional on an engagement on our part to fix a term within which the proposed railway should be continued through our sphere to the Indian frontier. M. Poklewsky would not admit that the alignment Tehran— Ispahan-Shiraz would benefit Russia by bringing her goods down to the south, and contended that we should reap all the advantages by getting our sea-borne goods carried north to compete with Russian trade. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. 'w/ 1 [March 25.] Section 2. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Goukassof to Viscount Errington. Hear Lord Errington, March 7, 1913. PENDING a more detailed examination of the papers which I perused the other day at your office, I may be allowed to make a few remarks on some points raised by the Foreign Office. Ispahan .—It has never been the intention of the Russian group to leave Ispahan out of their scheme. It was thought that Ispahan could be conveniently connected with the main line, say at Hain or at Ardistan, a matter of some GO to 100 miles, thereby including Ispahan into the scheme of our line. Comparative Population .—You told me already that you do not share the view of the Foreign Office that our line intersects an arid and poorly populated district. I have just compiled a few figures in support of your view. Our line would involve practically all the big towns of Persia, with one-third of the whole of the town population of Persia, which is supposed to be about 2,000,000. These are the figures, which I take from the “Statesman’s Year Book, 1912,” and other sources :— Astara . Resht Kazvin . Tehran . Kum Kashan , Ispahan . Yezd Kerman . Bampur . 10,000 40.000 80.000 280,000 30,000 30.000 80.000 45.000 80.000 10,000 In all (about) .. .. .. . • • • 635,000 The figure for Kerman is taken from the Consular Report No. 4886. [2836 56—2] COPY TO 23 MAY 19132 &lt; Practically all the biggest towns of Persia are on our proposed line, except Tabriz, with 200,000, and Meshed, about 100,000. . ^ r , i n , By o-iving up our alignment and adopting the Green way alignment we would lose Yezd, Kerman, and Bampur, with alout 135,000 town population, and gam only Shiraz with 30,000 to 40,000 population. So far about the towns. , v . T . As regards the country, the position is still worse, as Greenway s line from Ispahan to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas would run through a series of mountain ranges with none hut nomadic population, whereas our proposed line from Kashan to Kerman goes over The population of the Kerman district alone is given by Consular Report No. 4986 as 1,500,000, the whole of which must be taken as practically settled. The Consular Report No. 5033 on Bunder Abbas shows that the greater part of the exports from Bunder Abbas come from the Kerman Qistnct, which is the most industrial part of Southern Persia. # Speaking generally, the idea of connecting Ispahan with the sea through Sniraz and Bunder Abbas seems to me rather ill-conceived. It is much shorter connected with Mohammerah via Shuster, the route from Ispahan to Shuster being shortei than that .from Ispahan to Shiraz, and Shuster being on tne proposed Greenway raiivvay line Mohammerah-Khoremabad as well as on the River Karun. From the above you will see that from the point of view of the needs of Persia and of the railway itself there are no advantages gained by substituting the more tortuous alignment of Greenway for the straight alignment proposed by us. Chahbar via Bunder Abbas.—You will remember that in their first scheme the Russians did not intend at all to touch any points on the shore, but proposed to take the line across the interior of Baluchistan to join the Indian railways at Nushki. It was because of the objection that such scheme has met with here that it was abandoned and the Chahbar alignment was chosen instead. A glance at the Admiralty map of the ports in the Arabian Sea and in the Persian Gulf will show you the reason for that. In Bunder Abbas steamers have to anchor more than 2 miles from the shore. This is what Lloyds’ Register ” says about this port:— “ An open roadstead. Vessels load and discharge by lighters. There is a depth of 17 feet of water available in the port at L.W.O.S.T.” Surely this is not a port that can be used by a great transcontinental line. There are only two bays in Persia that offer all the advantages of a good natural harbour. These are Chahbar and Gwatar. The latter being on the Persian-Kabat frontier we have not considered it, but in Chahbar the depth of water near the shore is sometimes about 4*5 and 6 fathoms. With comparatively little expenditure Chahbar can be turned into a very good port. As regards the country between Kerman and Chahbar, which some are trying to represent as of no commercial interest and devoid of population, I have already mentioned above that the Consular Report No. 4986 gives the population of that district as 1,500,000 (out of the total population of Persia of 9,000,000, of which 2,500,000 must be taken as nomadic population, see the “ Statesman’s Year Book.”) The following extract from Chamber’s “Encyclopaedia, 1901” (vol. viii, p. 64), may interest you :—- “Although so much of Persia is desert some parts of the country are of exceeding fertility and beauty ; the immense valleys—some of them 100 miles in length between the various ranges of the Kerman Mountains—abound with the rarest and most valuable vegetable productions.” Surely this cannot be called a desert country, and where it is desert, as in some parts to the north-east from Yezd and Kerman, there are mines of nickel, cohalt, antimony, manganese, and borax (see “ Stateman’s Year Book ”). Again, the climatic conditions are all in favour of Chahbar as against Bunder Abbas, the former being open to refreshing south-west winds, whereas the latter is a typical garmisir with a hot and very depressing summer from April to October (see “ Encyclopedia Britannica,” 9th edition).

I had the honour to summarise the principal points of this Aide-Memoir© in my telegram of yester day’s date. The copy of the memorandum by Monsieur Goukassow mentioned as enclosed therein is identical with the letter addressed by that gentleman to Lord Errington, copy of which was forwarded to you in my despatch No. 90 of March Itfth last, and I am consequently omitting it from this despatch. (Signed) George W. Buchanan le Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Qf-nv TO |NH!A 92 AIDE MEMOIR! Thn Imperial Government have not failed to submit the Aide-Memoire of the British Embassy, dated l6t/l4th February of this year, and ihe documents attached to it to a careful examination, and the Russian Group of the '^ocietS d 1 Etudes' moreover was invited to the con sideration of the proposals which they contain. The examination in question leads to the conclu sion that the British Government, while continuing to express their sympathy in principle with the construc tion of a Trans-Persian Railway, now, however, in ^ connexion with such construction, intimate wishes which entirely change the original idea of the undertaking and raise doubts ae to the possibility of its realisa tion both from the financial point of view and the point of view of Russian interests in Persia. The wishes of the British Government briefly put are as follows 1. The question of the Junction of the Trans- Persian lino with the railways of India to remean for the present entirely open.5. The southern terminal point of the railway not to be any point on the littoral of the Indian Ocean but Bunder-Abbas on the Persian Gulf. 3. The direction of the line in Persia to be - Astnra - Pesht - Teheran - Isfahan - Shiraz - Bunder-Abbas, in place of the direction proposed by the 'SociSte d*Etudes' namely - Astara - Pesht - &lt; % Teheran - Yezd - Kerman - Chahhar. 4 . The question of an extension of lines from Bunder-Abbas in the direction of the Baloochistun frontier not to bo aecided now but to remain open. In general, the British Oovcrment do not desire for the present to bind themselves by any promises with respect to railways within tho limits of the British sphere of influence.6. 5. Both as regards the question ol the conatruction of the railway and the question of its management, the British Government differ entiate between the northemand southern sections of the line, and. insist that in all questione respecting the southern section England shall hove a deciding voice. Moreover, under the term ' southern section * is understood the entire por tion of the proposed route lying beyond the Russian sphere of influence, - namely - the section from Isfahan through Shiraz up to Bunder- * Abbas. It is aisc stipulated, that the portion ol the line or its branches outside the limits of the Russian sphere shall not be built ” until and in such measures as His Majesty's Government ' shall consider it politic and feasible. ^6. The British Go^eramant notify that previous to their statement of agreement in principle to the scheme of a Trang-Persian railway they had already promised their support to a group of individuals who subsequently formed the 'Persian railway Syndicate** for the construction of the lines a. 1 o harane rali-Kho rrenabad • b. Bunder-Abbas-herman. c. Bushire-Xxliabad and further to a certain point on d. Bunder-Abba s-Ghir&amp;z-Ahwaz. The British Government would wish the Trans-Persian Bail- way Company to come to some agreement with the above-men tioned group* The attitude of the Russian Group of the 'CociStS d’Etudes* towards the position thus taken up by the Brit ish Government is determined by the aim which this Group (representing, as is known, the initiative of the whole matter), set itself from the very conwiencement* This aim is the creation of a transit route through Russia and Persia between Europe on the one side and India and Australasia on the other. the line InIn the pursuance of this aim those responsible for the enterprise have become in a manner competitors of the ii^;dad Kailway. The basis of this competition consists in 1. a firm conviction that the shortest end roost suitable communication between iiuropc and India is aoross boutheni Fiussia and not throu^^h Turkey, and (2) a desire that liussia shall take advantage of her natural superiority in this res pect before the realisation of the ^agd&amp;d Line makes it difficult to c*o so# Again, the Group had in view also the necessity of railways for Persia herself, even tnoujh it is at first glance clear that local traffic only cannot justify the cost of construction of such lines# it is for this reason also that the initiators, as is known, seloeie* the route (within Persia) Latara-&gt; esht-fohcran-• osd-i.eraan-UhalibaX. This route, which is the anorteat, has also the further advantage that it intersects the most populated and productive provinces of Persia and emerges at the sola coastal point of southern Persia capable ox being converted into a good port, iuming next to s detailed consideration of the wishes of tin nritiah Government under the points specified, it mustant bo noted as follows:- i. in consideration of the apeci; 1 vi'till, prevalent in ijoglo-Indian political circles, the kussisil v rcu P 1 it possible to a^ree to this ooint. bein'* j.irii.lp convince' tl o t the junction of tlie Trans-Persian railway, once it is corpletod, with the indica railway system will be naturally effected in the course of tine. o .under-ATI ns as the terunal ooint for r 1; r c tranvut ro-t is inrcccptrdulc. in the copy of v. naj'onmdum (enclosed herewith) by onsieur Touka.ssow, one of the members of the Russian rroup, drawn up on the basis of - vt}nritativc br^lish source , it is tnown that btnder- nbbas cannot be converted into r. suite Tie sort without very great eyponditure. llonu; the entire southern shore of Terrir there is not a single point further rest tbmi Chalibar which coul ' be converted into u suitable port, The other point - G-uattar - is to the east of : ha hi nr on the orso-Paloochistan frontier. It would appear thet Persia has a. ri ht to expect that no interdict shall be placed on her one decent harbour. o. An alteration in the direction of the line as wished y the . ritiah }oveminent - a. will lengthen the mailmain line by approximately 35C versts, (b) will increase its cost oi construction approximately by 50 millions roubles; (c) will greatly decrease the transit importance of the line for European and Russian passenger and goods ^ ra rf^ Br * a will reduce the importance of the line for i: ersia herself, as it will leave on one side the populated provinces of Kerman, and Yezd in favour of the less populated and lass productive province of Shiran and the absolutely uninhabited and unproductive mountainous provinces in the south. Apart from this, the Russian Government, from the point of view of their own economic interests, have already repeatedly expressed themselves opposed to the construction in Persia of meridional railways terminatin' on the Persian Gulf. Finally, m has already been repeatedly pointed out, it would approximate the Trane-Persian railway towards the Bagdad line which would lead in time to the diverting of a part of the traffic to the latter.4. As regards extension of the line from Bunder-Abbas in tne direction oi naloochistan, the question is not worth discussion as ti: A e Russian Group in general cannot agree to Bunder Abbas as a terminal, even if temporary, point ox the railway. lo take the line to iunder Abbas, even if assured ol tne possibility in the future of its subsequent extension to Chahbar, does not appear expedient as such a 1 1 .»..j would travel lor a distance ol 600 ^versts* 1 along the absolutely barren coast of the Gulf of Oman. Once Chahbar is shofm to be th© natural terminus there are no grounds for approaching it by a circuitous route in place of direct from Kerman. 5. Taking into consideration the international character of tne enterprise, and equally, tne fact that the portion of the line mentioned in this point would not traverse the British but the neutral zone, it appears just and necessary that no one group of tne Company shall enjoy therein any preferential rights, and that influence and right of vote shall be divided to an absolutely equal degree@) degree ootwoen all tliree Groups. i oroovsr, coiisidQrin^; it extremely desirable to submit questions respecting trie construction of railways in the neutral zone to mutual consideration, for the sake of a possible agreement of respective interests, the Imperial Government have already notified the Russian Group that an extension of the Trane- Persian line b&amp;yond the limits of the Russian sphere cannot be realised previous to the conclusion of negotiations on this matter between the two Governments interested. 6. Tae Imperial Government and the Russian Group of the *Gociete d'htudes* were not a?/are tii&amp;t previous to the raising of tae question of trie construction of tne Trans- Persian line the British Government were already bound by a promise of support for tne 'Persian Railway syndicate*. For tneir own part, the imperial Government would not nave objected but would nave even regarded tae fusion of these two Companies as desirable. However, from information in their possession the international groups constituting the 'Bociete d'Htudcs* apparently regard the 'Persian Railway Syndicate' as not sufficiently stable from a financial point of view and therefore, as it appears, wouldwould not effect tne amalgamation specified witn any particular eagerness. Vsith respect to tne railways specified by the Syndi cate it must be noted tnat the line Bunder-Abbas-Shiraz- Ahwaz is absolutely unnecessary to Persia and has not any si^nificanee for local trade. It would appear that similarly it cannot nave any importance for Britian trade, as it is quite devoid of the character of a line of pene tration. It would run through &amp;&amp; unpopulated and mountainous locality almost parallel with the coast line at no great distance from it, and would connect two points, coiiimunication between which could be easily maintained by water. The endeavour of the Syndicate to effect a realisation of this line can have only one interpretation:- this line must form subsequently one of the links of a - railway which will connect trie Bagdad railway with India. It is sufficient to cast a glance at the map to be con vinced of tnis. If the Syndicate succeeds in obtaining a concession for this line there will b© danger of the subsequent formation of a combination resembling the well knownxzy knovrn a£-reament between the Shipping; Company of Lynch and the German Bank. In view of these considerations, the Imperial Government cannot but be averee to the line in question. While having no objections against the other railways proposed (of which the line Mohammera-Khorremabad is already guaranteed by an option) the Imperial Government, in accord ance with the opinion of the Russian Group of the “Gociete d’htudes', imagine that at any rata the Trans-Persian /n Haib ay could be linked up with t;.3 line CLahbar~Regan-BaB- Keriaan if this latter line is constructed by the ’’Syndicate of Persian Railways*. Finally, the Imperial Government consider it necessary again to note that they cannot agree with the known endeavour of the Syndicate in question to secure for itself the right to construct almost all the railways in the neutral zone. That this is the aim of tne Syndicate is*clearly seen in the projected agreement with the Persian Government as drawn up by the Syndicate. Tills fact has already been the subject of personal explana tions between Monsieur Sazonoff and Gir h. Grey.[L The Russian Government regard it as unquestion ably necessary to guarantee for Russians undertaking enterprises, even if in company with international groups, a sii.iilar right to railway construction in the sons specified and in particular mention the following lines 1. Isfahan - Shims. 2. Isfahan - Ahwas. j. Yesd - Kerman. 4. Yesd - Sliirass. 3. Isfalaan - Khorromabad. In conclusion, the Imperial Government consider It their duty to note that the Russian Group of the •Societe d'Etudes' regards the realisation of the Trans-Persian railway along the route specified by the British Government will involve, from the financial point of view, difficulties so great as to border on the impossible. The Group named lias intimated that under such conditions the whole enterprise of a Trans-Persian railway threatens to fall to places or to assume an entirely different character - namely the construction of special RussianRuEBlan linuE of penetration in the Rueeian and. neutral aonoB, of course with a preponderating Russian influence. With reference to point 3 of the Aide-Memoire of the British anbassy of 2nd/l5th May 1911, the Rueelan Government, in the event of the realisation of the project of a Trans-Persian line in accordance with the wishes of the *Sociate d*Etudes' and upon the condition of reciprocity, are prepared not to permit railway construction within the limits of the Russian aone and the neutral sons near the Porso- Afghan frontier without a prelirainary agreement on the subject with the British Government. In addition and on similar conditions, the Russian Government recognise the correctness of the desire expressed by the London Cabinet tlaat equality for British and Indo-British trade shall be established both on the main Trans-Persian line and on its branches.

' (May 14, 8*45 p.m.) YOUR despatch No. 64 : Trans-Persian Railway. I have received an aide-memoire from the Russian Government too lengthy to summarise by telegraph. Following are its chief points :— Russian group Societe Etudes agrees to leave open for the present the question of linking Trans-Persian Railway with Indian railway system. Bunder Abbas is unsuitable as a terminal port, and cannot be accepted by the Russian group. Natural port would be.Chahbar. So far as the line south of Ispahan will lie in neutral zone, it is right and necessary that all three groups should have equal rights of control over it. The Russian Government protest against apparent endeavour of Persian Railway Syndicate to secure a monopoly of railway construction in neutral zone, and they must reserve to Russian enterprise right to construct various lines in that zone. Russian group has intimated that, if British proposals are insisted on, the whole project of the Trans-Persian Railway threatens to fall through, or to take form of the construction of Russian railways of penetration into Russian and negtral zones. In the event of realisation of the Trans-Persian Railway scheme in accordance with the wishes of the Societe d’Etudes, the Russian Government would be ready to refuse its consent to railway construction close to the Afghan frontier in Russian or neutral zones. li f. iY!AY1,:i@ on this subject, please quote this SUOjeci, please quutu N , 20031/13 In any further communication and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

With reference to previous correspondence relative to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward G-rey to transmit to you herewith copies of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg and of two letters from the Societe d’Etudes on the subject. It will be observed that the letter of Monsieur Goukassow to Viscount Errington, copies of which are enclosed both in Sir G. Buchanan’s despatch and in the Societe’s earlier letter, set forth the strong objections entertained, by the Russian group, on commercial grounds, to the only alignment of the railway which His Majesty’s Government are prepared, for strategic reasons, to accept, and it is apparent from the Societe* s letter that the(14135/13) latter alignment is equally distasteful to that body as a whole. The later letter of the Societe is concerned with the distribution of international interests in the railway and the scheme proposed therein appears to differ from that outlined in tfee Board «£■ graded letter of the only in respect of the proportion of capital assigned to each of the three participating groups in each of the two sections into which it is proposed to divide the line with a view to settle this question. Should the construction of the line eventually be proceeded with it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to reach an agreement with the Russian Govern ment as to the point in the neutral zone in Persia where its northern section should be held to end and its southern section to begin and I am to observe in this connexion that, in Sir E. Grey’s view, it would be advisable that the spot chosen should lie as close as possible to the border of the Russian sphere not only(14155/13) 1 Ht for strategic reasons but also because the section of the line lying in that sphere is longer and likely to prove more remunerative than that in the British sphere. I am to state that Sir E, Grey would be glad to receive the observations of the Marquess of Crewe on the enclosed correspondence. I am Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant,^-1 8, BISHOPSGATE LONDON, E.C. 27th March, 1913. Societe Internationale d'Etudes du Chemin de Fer Transuersan. Yesterday I transmitted to you a communication which had teen made to Sir William G-arstin by the President of the Societe d'Eludes, and which set forth some of the objections entertained by our French and Russian colleagues to the changes now proposed in the scheme of the Trans-Persian Railway. I now have the honour to transmit a further communication, received from the same source, con sisting of a sketch (drafted by the Cornite de Direction) of a scheme for the distribution of the international interests in a hypothetical railway. It is understood that a similar sketch is being submitted to the Russian Government for their consideration, the intention of the Comite being to prepare a defxnite project if the main principles should be approved. The The Under Secretary of Slate Foreign Office.The draft sketch in question presupposes that an agreement on the important question of alignment will he reached between the Conseil or International Board of the Societe aid the Governments concerned. On this question the Board as a wnole has not yet had an opportunity of formulating its opinion, but the attitude of the individual groups may be to some ex tent foreshadowed, as far as our foreign friends are concerned, by the communications which have been received from the Comite de Direction, and as far as the English members are concerned, by certain informal discussions which have taken place in London. These last as far as they have gone, have tended to shew that the building of a railway to link up As tara- Resht-Tehran-Ispahan-Shiraz-Bundar Abbas (participa tion in the scheme being, in addition, understood to be contingent on the Societe d’Etudes acquiring a subordinate interest in the capital of the Persian Railways Syndicate) would not be likely to commend itself as a business proposal to the individuals who compose the Bntj.sh group. As the choice of alignment is, of course, vital toto the main issue, the English group must he under stood to reserve their opinion as to the merits of the scheme and the terms of participation proposed in the Note of the Oomite which forms the subject of this letter.

NOTES ON THE PROPOSED TPANS-PEPSIAN PAILWAY Preface. The accompanying notes, whilst relating to the communications from the Foreign Office dated 4th February and 24th February, invite consideration to some important questions of principle having reference only to the financial and commercial aspects of the Trans-Persian Pailway, and the bearings thereof as re gards Persia. These questions are: 1) The point at which the line should touch the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea respectively. 2) The alignment or route to be followed by the line. 3) The scheme of a desirable development of Pail way in Persia. It is considered that all other points referred to in the above communications, such as the linking up of the Persian lines with those of India, the gauge, the allocation, if any, of the control over the different sections£37 sections of the line, and other questions involving political issues, could he discussed with advantage later on in connection with the decisions arrived at on the above three principal points. The necessity of railways in Persia for the pur pose of promoting the peaceful development of the coun try, increasing commerce, exports in particular, and providing greater security in the country has always been acutely recognised. The difficulty of the problem, was that no project of railways having for its sole aim the satisfaction of the local needs of Persia could stand the proof of a financial examination, owing to the mountainous character of Persia and its sparse popula tion. The Trans-Persian Pailway seeks to solve that pro blem by combining the local needs of Persia with the needs of transit in the hope that by such combination the line may become practicable. In dealing with a project of such magnitude involv ing the expenditure of a large capital, it is necessary to take into account and consider carefully every de tail, in order to attain a maximum of efficiency with a minimum of expenses of construction, as well as of the workingworking of the line. It may be taken, therefore, that the elements to enter Into a combination to render the line a finan cial success will be: 1. That at both ends of the line in Per sia, both in the North as well as in the South, there should be all possible facilities for in creasing and expediting the import and export of goods, as well as the passenger traffic. 2. That the line should be as short as possible. 3. That those districts through which the line will pass, should be fairly populated and should afford possibilities for the development of the production of staple export goods of Per sia and also of the consumption of goods import ed into Persia. 4. That an easy access should be given to other well populated parts of Persia, to be con nected eventually by branch lines with the main line. 1. The point at which the line should touch thfe . Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea . The point at which it was proposed that the pro jectedprojected line should touch the Arabian Sea was Chah- bar. Now it is suggested that that point be trans ferred to Bunder-Abas, leaving the question open as to whether in future this point should be connected through Chahbar with Karachi. This suggestion makes it neces sary that Bunder-Abas should be considered on its own merits as, at any rate temporary, and possibly per manent Southern Terminus of the Trans-Persian line. It is intended that the Trans-Persian line should constitute the last link of the lines connecting the Atlantic with the Indian Sea, and indeed with the In dian system of railways. It is obvious therefore that such railway should be provided with an adequate harbour wherever it touched the Indian Sea or the Per sian Gulf. Bunder-Abas can have no claims to being or becom ing such a harbour. Lloyd's Pegister (1912-1913 vol.2 p.639) refers to Bunder-Abas in the following terms:- 'An open roadstead, Vessels load and discharge by 'lighters. There is a depth of 17 feet of water avails 'able in the port at L.W.O.S.T.' The British Consul says in his report (C.P.No.5.033.) 'The port owes its present existence to the fact 'that it is a convenient, or perhaps one should say 'the'least Inconvenient, entrepot, for goods destined ior 'the South Eastern portion of the Shah's Dominions. 'It possesses, from a shipping point of view, but one 'advantage, and many drawbacks. It is situated at the 'top of the re-entering Bay, extending from hingah on 'the West, to Mivah on the East, and across this bay 'stretch the three islands of Kishna, Larak and Homiz, 'which form a natural break-water, consequently the 'po^t is very protected and it is vary rare that the 'sea is too rough to interfere in any way with loading 'and unloading cargo. Against this solitary advantage 'is the serious drawback of a beach that shelves very 'gradually; as a result the 4 fathom anchorage is two 'railes out, and the short masonry pier in front of the 'Custon House, on to which all goods have to he dis charged, is high and dry except at hightide. Lighters ’’can only he brought alongside during about th^ee hours 'at the top of the tide, and considerable delay is 'thus caused.' Tn the face of the above it is evident that Bunder-Abas is in its present state quite unfit to handle goods in any considerable quantities. It is also evident that if It can be made a good harbour at all. thethe expenses involved will he enormous. All the other ports on the Persian shore of the Gulf present the same characteristics. (See C.F. No.4823, page 20). One must therefore look for a good harbour to the Fs-St from Bunder-Abas, and here, there are only Chahbar and Gwatar, both of which present all the features necessary for the making of good harbour capable of serving as a terminus for a trans-continental line. The Admiralty chart attached hereto shows that depths of 3 l/2 fathoms and even 4 fathoms are much nearer the shore in these two places than at any other protected place on the whole coast. The entrance to the bay of Chahbar has a depth of 8 fathoms and the shape of the bay is such as to sug gest that the approach of steamers to the shore can be effected with great ease and comparatively enali ex pense would be required for the construction of piers.2. Route. The effect of the suggested alteration would he that the two great districts of Kirman and Yezd (the term ’’district’ 1 is taken all through these notes in the sense of British Consular reports) will he cut asunder from the line, and their place would he taken hy the district of Sliiras. As regards the district of Isfahan, either alignment would cross it, and as in the first alignment it was proposed to connect the town of Isfahan with the main line hy a branch line from Nain, either alignment would reach equally the central and most populated part of the district. A comparison should therefore he between the claims of Kirman and Yezd districts on one side and those of Shiraz district on the other side. Kirman is the largest town in the whole of Central and Southern Persia except perhaps Isfahan. The Consular report No. 4986 estimates the population of the town itself at 80,000, and of the whole province at 1,500,000. Thus one sixth of the total populationpopulation of Persia is in Kirman district. As re gards the country between Kirraan and Chahbar, it is 'of exceeding fertility and beauty'; the 'iinraenee valleys some of them 100 miles in length, between the various ranges of the Kirman mountains, abound with the rarest and most valuable vegetable pro ductions' (Chamber's Encyclopaedia 1901, V.8, p.64). Yezd with its 50,000 population is probably the third town of importance in the whole of the Central and Southern Persia. We have no data of the popu lation of the Yead district. Both the Kixmn and the Yezd districts are amongst the foremost districts producing the staple goods of Persian Export, such as cotton (see C.R. No. 5037. p.6, about cotton in Yezd) rice, opium, gum, fruit etc. Further the car pet industry is highly developed not only in Kirman, tout also in Yezd (C.R. No. 4838 p.32). As regards the crops in Kirman district 'in years of good harvest fields of wheat are. set fire to to clear the ground, as the crops were more than sufficient for local consumption, and it ms too costly to transport the surplus to the coast'.(C.R. No. 5033.p.8). There are no exact data of the amount of trade ip these two districts, but of course it is known thatthat practically the whole trade of Bunder-Abae and part of the trade of BuBhire 1b with those districts. Shiraz on the other hand is given as having a population of 30 to 40,000 (see Stateraan's Year Book). 'Its market has three main outputs:- (A) as an urban centre in which the distribution is effected by shop-keepers selling to the inhabitants of the city Itself and districts lying in close proximity (B) as an entrepSt market in what may be called semi- retail trade, where the distribution is done by pedlars, touring anongst the nomad tribes (c) as an entrepot market in wholesale trade sending its surplus for disposal in Yezd and Isfahan whenever the ruling prices enable this to be done at a profit'. (C.B No. 4342 p.3). The aspect (c) would be satisfied by either of the two proposed routes and it is only the aspects (A) and (B), viz. the local tre.de, and trade with the nomad tribes that would suffer in the case of the adoption of the original scheme. The products of the Shiraz district are chiefly, gum, opium, almonds, skins and fruit, but the total amount— — fat amount of these products must he taken as being much less tlian the production of either the Yesiid or Kirman districts. Thus the comparison of the economic value for Persia itself of the original scheme, and of that now proposed, tells greatly in favour of the first. In order to establish a comparison between the respective lengths of the two proposed align ments it is assumed in the following that in the alignment as altered by the Foreign Office, the line will be eventually carried through Bunder-Abas to Chahbar. (l) In the original alignment the lengths would be as follows:- Astara to Kashan about 453 miles Keshan to Kirman ' 448 » Kirman to Chahbar 9 521 8 Total about 1422 miles (2) In the alignment as altered, the lengths would be as follows:- Astara to Kashan about 453 miles Kashan to Isfahan ' 102 miles Isfahan to Shiraz ' 310 miles Shiraz to Bunder-Abas 8 420 miles Bunder-Abas • to Chahbar * 367 miles Total about 1661 miles ToTo (l) must ba added the branch from Main to Isfahan of 70 ioiles, bringing the total length of (l) to 1512 miles as against 1661 miles of (2), or a difference of 149 miles in favour of (l). The comparison of barometric profiles in the possession of the Societe d^udes shows again that in the scheme (l) the line from Kashan to Kirrnan will cross a practically level country, presenting no difficulties of construction whatever. Between Kiman and Chahbar, there are two difficult places, one between Mahun and Rain, and another near Champ, but on the whole the descent from the Persian plateau is easier at this place than at any other. On the other hand the country between Kashan and Isfahan, between Isfahan and Shiran, and again between Shiraz; and Bunder-Abas, present very great difficulties as shown in the attached profiles. The line would have to cross not less than nine mountain ranges. Thus if the two alternative alignments are compared on their own merits only, and from the point of view of both the home and transit trade of PersiaPersia, all the advantages are on the side of the original alignment. 3. The scheme of a desirable development of railways in Persia. The Persian Railway Syndicate is interested in the lines:- (a) from Mohammerad to Korrenmabad, (b) from Bunder-Abas to Kirman, (c) from 3 usj.ix-x .&gt; via Aliabad to some point on the line, (d) from Bunder-Abas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. The concession of the line (a) has been already granted and does not therefore enter into question. (&amp;) As regards the Societe d*Etudes does not possess its barometric profile, but the descent from Kirman to Bunder-Abas reported by one of the expert members of the Council of the Societe d*Etudes who has studied the matter on the spot, as being th$ most difficult one of all descents. The length of \ the line must be taken at about 300 miles as against 520 miles of the line Kirman - Chahbar, this being the only advantage of the Kirman - Bunder-Abas lin t AgainstAgainst that there are the following drawbacks:- (1) The line is of little importance, if of any at all, for the fertile district to the South of the town of Kirman. (2) The cost of construction and the working expenses per mile will be much higher than for the Kinaan - Chahbar line. (3) The handling of traffic at Bunder-Abas will present great difficulties and require extra expenses. The C.R. No. 5033, p.10, estimates the charges of discharging goods from steamers at Bunder-Abas at 6/2 per ton of piece goods and 4/l per ton of sugar. ( 4 ) The line can have no value for transit traffic unless it is connected with a good harbour like Chahbar, in which case the total length of Kirrnan - Bunder-Abas - Chahbar, would be about 676 miles, as against 520 miles Kirman to Chahbar. The line under (c) may present some com mercial interest and should be included in the general scheme of the railways in Persia, but it runs over a very difficult country and should be first built from Bushire to Shiraz and afterwards prolonged from Shiraz to Isfahan. The line under (d) cannot claim as being of any interest whatever for Persia or for the Persian trade. It runs parallel to the shore and connects Bunder-— — —— . _ . _ Bunder-Atee with Ahwaa, two points that can he easily reached by water; It le obviously projected as a link to be connected later on with the Bagdad line. The Societe d'Etudes cannot reasonably be expected to support that line or any part of it in contradiction to the objects set forth in its articles of Associa- tion. As regards the working out of a general scheme of railways in Persia, it would be evident from the above observations, that the same would take the following fora; two main lines, one being the line projected by the Societe d'Etudes and the other being the line from Muhamrah to Korramabad and thence to Kirroanshah, will form the basis of the system. A line from Teheran to Hamadan and Khanikin will have to he built in future for obvious reasons. The branch line from Nain to Isfahan will iiava to be carried either to Ahawaz or to Shiran and Busliire[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] (vd) [B] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. 113413] Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 25.) (No. 90.) gi rj St. Betersburgh, March 18, 1913. M. SAZONOF gave me last week a letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a cop}^, that M. Goukassof, one of the Russian representatives of the Societe d’Etudes, had addressed to Lord Errington on the subject of the alignment of the proposed Trans- Persian Railway. His Excellency at the same time remarked that the facts and figures cited by M. Goukassof were all derived from British sources. I replied that this might be so, but that we had from the outset vetoed the proposal of the line passing through Kerman and Bampur. His Excellency had been too occupied with other matters to resume the discussion of our latest proposals. They are, however, being examined by the Russian promoters of the railway scheme, who, according to what M. Poklewsky told me, as reported in my telegram No. 83 of the 11th instant, have been very unfavourably impressed by them. He doubted very much if they would ever accept them, and considered that they would in any case make their acceptance conditional on an engagement on our part to fix a term within which the proposed railway should be continued through our sphere to the Indian frontier. M. Poklewsky would not admit that the alignment Tehran- Ispahan-Shiraz would benefit Russia by bringing her goods down to the south, and contended that we should reap all the advantages by getting our sea-borne goods carried north to compete with Russian trade. T tin vp GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Goukassof to Viscount Errington. Dear Lord Errington, March 7, 1913. PENDING a more detailed examination of the papers which I perused the other day at your office, I may be allowed to make a few remarks on some points raised by the Foreign Office. Ispahan .—It has never been the intention of the Russian group to leave Ispahan out of their scheme. It was thought that Ispahan could be conveniently connected with the main line, say at Hain or at Ardistan, a matter of some GO to 100 miles, thereby including Ispahan into the scheme of our line. Comparative Population .—Tou told me already that you do not share the view of the Foreign Office that our line intersects an arid and poorly populated district. I have just compiled a few figures in support of your view. Our line would involve practically all the big towns of Persia, with one-third of the whole of the town population of Persia,, which is supposed to be about 2,000,000. These are the figures, which I take from the “ Statesman’s Year Book, 1912,” and other sources :— Astara .. Resht Kazvin .. Tehran .. Kum Kashan ,. Ispahan .. Yezd Kerman .. Bampur .. In all (about) 10,000 40.000 30.000 280,000 30,000 30.000 80.000 45.000 80.000 10,000 635,000 The figure for Kerman is taken from the Consular Report No. 4886. [2836 bh—2]Practically all the biggest towns of Persia are on our proposed line, except Tabriz, with 200,000, and Meshed, about 100,000. By giving up our alignment and adopting the Greenway alignment we would lose Yezd, Kerman, and Bampur, with alout 135,000 town population, and gain only Shiraz with 30,000 to 40,000 population. So far about the towns. As regards the country, the position is still worse, as Greenway’s line from Ispahan to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas would run through a series of mountain ranges with none but nomadic population, whereas our proposed line from Kashan to Kerman goes over level land. The population of the Kerman district alone is given by Consular Beport No. 4986 as 1,500,000, the whole of which must be taken as practically settled. The Consular Beport No. 5033 on Bunder Abbas shows that the greater part of the exports from Bunder Abbas come from the Kerman district, which is the most industrial part of Southern Persia. Speaking generally, the idea of connecting Ispahan with the sea through Shiraz and Bunder Abbas seems to me rather ili-conceived. It is much shorter connected with Mohammerah via Shuster, the route from Ispahan to Shuster being shorter than that from Ispahan to Shiraz, and Shuster being on the proposed Greenway railway line Mohammerah-Khoremabad as well as on the Biver Karun. From the above you will see that from the point of view of the needs of Persia and of the railway itself there are no advantages gained by substituting the more tortuous alignment of Greenway for the straight alignment proposed by us. Chohbar via Bunder Abbas. — You will remember that in their first scheme the Bussians did not intend at all to touch any points on the shore, but proposed to take the line across the interior of Baluchistan to join the Indian railways at Nushki. It was because of the objection that such scheme has met with here that it was abandoned and the Chahbar alignment was chosen instead. A glance at the Admiralty map of the ports m the Arabian Sea and in the Persian Gulf will show you the reason for that. In Bunder Abbas steamers have to anchor more than 2 miles from the shore. This is what * £ Lloyds’ Begister ” says about this port:— “ An open roadstead. _ Vessels load and discharge by lighters. There is a depth of 17 feet of water available in the port at L.W.O.S.T.” Surely this is not a port that can be used by a great transcontinental line. There are only owo bays in Persia that oiler all the advantages of a good natural harbour. These aie Chahbar and Gwatar. The latter being on the Persian—Kabat frontier we have not consideied iu, but in Chahbar the depth of water near the shore is sometimes about 4 5 and 6 fathoms. 'W ith comparatively little expenditure Chahbar can be turned into a very good port. • As regaids the country between Kerman and Chahbar, which some are trying to represent as of no commercial interest and devoid of population, I have already mentioned above that the Consular Beport No. 4986 gives the population of that district as 1,500,000 (out of the total population of Persia of 9,000,000, of which 2 500,00° must be taken as nomadic population, see the “ Statesman’s Year Book.’’) the following extract from Chamber’s “Encyclopaedia, 1901” (vol. viii p. 64) may interest you :— v &gt; r /&gt; j Although so much of Persia is desert some parts of the country are of exceeding fertility and beauty ; the immense valleys—some of them 100 miles in length between the various ranges of the Kerman Mountains-abound with the rarest and most valuable vegetable productions.” Suiely this cannot be called a desert country, and where it is desert, as in some parts to the north-east from Yezd and Kerman, there are mines of nickel, cobalt, antimony, manganese, and borax (see “ Stateman’s Year Book ”) . A gM n } the climatic conditions are all in favour of Chahbar as against Bunder Abbas the former being open to refreshing south-west winds, whereas the latter is a typical garmisir with a hot and very depressing summer from April to October (see Encyclopaedia Bntanmca, 9th edition).

Memorandum respecting Trans-Persian Bailway.—Communicated by Mr. Eddison {Board of Trade). A CONFERENCE took place on the 10th March, 1913, at the Board of Trade to discuss with representatives of the British group of the Societe d’Etudes the questions raised in Lord Errington’s memorandum of the 3rd March. There were present : Sir H. Llewellyn Smith, Mr. Mar wood, and Mr. Stanley (Board of Trade), Mr. Parker (Foreign Office), Sir A. Hirtzel and Mr. Brereton (India Office), and Lord Errington, Sir William Bisset, and Mr. F. C. Harrison (representing the British group), together with Mr. Cecil Baring. L With regard to possible future continuation of a line beyond Bunder Abbas, so as to afford through communication with India, it was explained to the representatives of the British group (and particularly in answer to a question by Lord Errington whether the portion east of Bunder Abbas would be international or British) that the idea of foreign participation was probably not necessarily excluded from that section on the main line so far as it might be within Persian territory, subject to the predomi nance of British capital and control being secured. Mr. Parker said, however, that if it was desired to convey some final statement to the Societe d’Etudes as an official pronouncement the Foreign Office would prefer to have the question put to them in writing with a view to an official answer. The break of gauge would probably be made at Bunder Abbas, supposing the line to be carried on towards India; but Mr. Parker stated that the Foreign Office con sidered that the question of a connection between Indian and Russian lines should be excluded from the present discussions, which had in view, in fact, simply a Trans- Persian railway (and branches) from the Russian frontier to the sea, to be carried out on their commercial merits. 2. The international distribution of capital and control in building and working the line was then considered (points 2, 3, and 4 of Lord Errington’s memorandum). Sir H. LI. Smith said that the practical problem was now a railway from Astara to the Gulf, which, it was agreed, probably would be found to mean to Bunder Abbas, as construction to Bushire would prove costly and probably less remunerative. He said that what the Board of Trade hoped to see was the simultaneous construction of railways starting from the two termini and meeting at a half-way point— e.g., at Ispahan. Otherwise, if the construction began at the Russian end and worked south wards Russian trade would follow it down, and British interests would suffer immediately and also ultimately, as the Russians would have captured such markets as there may be. The representatives of the British group agreed that simultaneous construction was desirable, but doubted whether it could be arranged for. The representatives of the British group asked wffiether His Majesty’s Government contemplated two separate companies, with separate capitals and separate boards of directors. Sir H. LI. Smith said that this was what was intended. He had some doubt as to the desirability of the proposai to pool receipts on the whole line which the group had in view. Lord Errington, Sir W. Bisset, and Mr. Harrison pointed out that, owing partly to the smaller cost of construction of the northern section, and partly to the greater wealth and importance and the more settled state of the district which would be served by it, the Russian part of the undertaking was likely to be far the more remunerative, having a smaller capitalisation per mile and higher receipts per mile. This they regarded as a very grave objection to the proposed separation of capital, an objection which would only be removed if a very large development of tiade appeared in the south. Sir H. LI. Smith said that the joint control by the central board was intended to affect through traffic only, leaving the local traffic on each section to be looked after by the respective companies. [2836 t—8] 4?' 1 ' \ C { sec;:; TARY’S N2 ■/Some of the representatives of the British group expressed the opinion that, as the traffic would necessarily go principally to the most important places to places north of Ispahan), more efficient safeguards against discrimination m favour of trade of a particular nationality would be secured by control of the whole line under a single company than by sub-division. It was agreed that this might be so as regar s hiough traffic, which, in the opinion of the British group, would be of paramount importance as regards traffic coming from the south. The case would be otherwise with local traffic. So far as concerns local traffic on the southern section, it was obvious that British interests could be better protected by a separate board on which they had a preponderating representation. It was evident, however, that the British group had no great expectation of much local traffic in the south. . rr j It was agreed that the great difference as regards heaviness of traffic and remunerative character which the British group anticipated betw een the nort lern and southern sections constituted a grave fact and an added difficulty. The i epresentatives of the group were asked to consider whether a scheme could be devised which would secure British interests on the southern section of the railway, while allowing the closer relations which they deemed necessary for financial purposes. 3. With regard to the fifth point in Lord Errington’s memorandum, bir H. LI. Smith asked whether the French rights under the international agreement extended to a definite claim to participate to the extent of one-third in every contract. The representatives of the British group were in some doubt as to the exact under standing between the groups on this point, but they agreed in thinking that the French, quite justifiably, considered themselves entitled to a full one-third share in all contracts. This could not reasonably be applied to particular contracts, but would be taken on the average of a given period. Sir H. LI. Smith said it was important that this should not apply to personnel. 4. Finally, after some discussion of the superiority, as financial undertakings, of other concessions mainly in Western Persia within the Russian sphere of influence, it was arranged that the British group should for the moment continue their tentative discussions with the other groups of the Societe d’Etudes, and that His Majesty’s Government should be informed of the result. It was clear that hopes had been enter tained that, in view of His Majesty’s Government’s interest in the proposals, financial support from the Government might be forthcoming at a later stage. Mr. Baring asked whether there was any hope of a Government guarantee, or of financial assistance in any form from the British or Indian Governments, if the scheme were carried out. The reply was that no such proposal was under consideration, and Mr. Baring was referred to the explicit statement on the subject in the Foreign Office letter of the 4th February, 1913.

Llewellyn Smith to Sir L. Mallet.—{Received March 15.) Dear Mallet, Board of Trade, March 14, 1913. IN the course of our recent discussion with the representatives of the British group on the Societe d’Etudes, a strong case, on purely financial and economic grounds, was, I think, made by the British group in favour of a single company to construct and work the whole of the line from the Russian frontier to the Persian Gulf, as against our suggestion of two separate companies with separate capitals, revenues, and expenditures. It was shown that, if this course were not adopted, the Russians would have all the fat and we should have all the lean. As a result it was left for the British group and for ourselves to think over the question whether any scheme could he devised which would give us the predominance wdiich we insist upon at the Persian Gulf end, and also protect our trade against discrimination, while nevertheless giving us the advantage of sharing in the more lucrative part of the enterprise. Thinking over the matter in consultation with our experts, 1 have come to the conclusion that it would be possible for us to agree to a single company with unified capital, receipts, and expenditure, constructing and working the whole line, subject to the following conditions :— 1. That there should be two sub-committees—one predominantly British and one predominantly Russian—to whom should be delegated the actual work of control of the southern and northern sections of the line respectively. 2. That railway rates should in general be fixed on a milage basis, with allowance of what is known as bonus milage in respect of the more expensive sections of the line. No deviation to be made from this principle of charge without the consent of the British sub-committee in each case. 3. All non-Persian employees on the section of the railway immediately contiguous to the Persian Gulf, e g., from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz (or within such a radius of the Gulf as the Foreign Office and India Office think essential) to be exclusively British, and supplies and materials used on this part of the line to be at least predominantly British. 4. The British directors to be approved by His Majesty’s Government. Of course, none of these conditions touch the vital question of guarantee^ by the British and Indian Governments ; they are only designed to meet the very real difficulty which the British group have put to us of sub-division of capital and control. If you think well to convey the substance of this to Lord Errington, I have objection. Yours very truly, H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. no P.S.—Of course the condition as of the line would be maintained. to simultaneous construction from the two ends H. L. S.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey—(Received March 25 ) (No. 90.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, March 18, 1913. M. SAZONOF gave me last week a letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, that M. Goukassof, one of the Eussian representatives of the Societe d’Etudes, had addressed to Lord Errington on the subject of the alignment of the proposed Trans- Persian Eaiiway. His Excellency at the same time remarked that the facts and figures cited by M. Goukassof were all derived from British sources. I replied that this might be so, but that we had from the outset vetoed the proposal of the line passing through Kerman and Bampur. His Excellency had been too occupied with other matters to resume the discussion of our latest proposals. They are, however, being examined by the Russian promoters of the railway scheme, who, according to what M. Poklewsky told me, as reported in my telegram No. 83 of the 11th instant, have been very unfavourably impressed by them. He doubted very much if they would ever accept them, and considered that they would in any case make their acceptance conditional on an engagement on our part to fix a term within which the proposed railway should be continued through our sphere to the Indian frontier. M. Poklewsky would not admit that the alignment Tehran- Ispahan-Shiraz would benefit Russia by bringing her goods down to the south, and contended that we should reap all the advantages by getting our sea-borne goods carried north to compete with Russian trade. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Goukassof to Viscount Errington. Dear Lord Errington, March 7, 1913. PENDING a more detailed examination of the papers which I perused the other day at your office, I may be allowed to make a few remarks on some points raised by the Foreign Office. Ispahan. —It has never been the intention of the Russian group to leave Ispahan out of their scheme. It was thought that Ispahan could be conveniently connected with the main line, say at Hain or at Ardistan, a matter of some GO to 100 miles, thereby including Ispahan into the scheme of our line. Comparative Population. —You told me already that you do not share the view of the Foreign Office that our line intersects an arid and poorly populated district. I have just compiled a few figures in support of your view. Our line would involve practically all the big towns of Persia, with one-third of the whole of the town population of Persia, which is supposed to be about 2,000,000. These are the figures, which I take from the “Statesman’s Year Book, 1912,” and other sources :— Astara .. .. .. .. 10,000 Resht 40,000 Kazvin .. ' .. 30,000 Tehran .. .. 280,000 Kum 30,000 Kashan 30,000 Ispahan .. 80,000 Yezd .. .. .. 45,000 Kerman .. 80,000 Bampur .. togioo In all (about) .. .. .. •• •• 635,000 The figure for Kerman is taken from the Consular Report No. 4886. [2836 bb—2] ,v\ 4 RPR 1913-}2 Practically all the biggest towns of Persia are on our proposed line, except Tabriz, with 200,000, and Meshed, about 100,000. , By giving up our alignment and adopting the Greenway alignment we would lose Yezd, Kerman, and Bampur, with alout 135,000 town population, and gam only Shiraz with 30,000 to 40,000 population. . So far about the towns. . „ &gt; r i* t t As regards the country, the position is still worse, as Greenway s line from Ispahan to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas would run through a series of mountain ranges with none but nomadic population, whereas our proposed line from Kashan to Kerman goes over Thn^population of the Kerman district alone is given by Consular Report No. 4986 as 1,500,000, the whole of which must be taken as practically settled. The Consular Report No. 5033 on Bunder Abbas shows that the greater part of the exports from Bunder Abbas come from the Kerman district, which is the most industrial part of Southern Persia. Speaking generally, the idea of connecting Ispahan with the sea through bhiraz and Bunder Abbas seems to me rather ill-conceived. It is much shorter connected with Mohammerah via Shuster, the route from Ispahan to Shuster being shorter than that from Ispahan to Shiraz, and Shuster being on the proposed Greenway railway line Mohammerah-Khoremabad as well as on the River Karun. From the above you will see that from the point of view of the needs of Persia and of the railway itself there are no advantages gained by substituting the more tortuous alignment of Greenway for the straight alignment proposed by us. Chahbar via Bunder Abbas—You will remember that in their first scheme the Russians did not intend at all to touch any points on the shore, but proposed to take the line across the interior of Baluchistan to join the Indian railways at Nushki. It was because of the objection that such scheme has met with here that it was abandoned and the Chahbar alignment was chosen instead. A glance at the Admiralty map of the ports in the Arabian Sea and in the Persian Gulf will show you the reason for that. In Bunder Abbas steamers have to anchor more than 2 miles from the shore. This is what “ Lloyds Register ” says about this port:— “ An open roadstead. Vessels load and discharge by lighters. There is a depth of 17 feet of water available in the port at L.W.O.S.T.” Surely this is not a port that can be used by a great transcontinental line. There are only two bays in Persia that offer all the advantages of a good natural harbour. These are Chahbar and Gwatar. The latter being on the Persian-Kabat frontier we have not considered it, but in Chahbar the depth of water near the shore is sometimes about 4'5 and 6 fathoms. With comparatively little expenditure Chahbar can be turned into a very good port. As regards the country between Kerman and Chahbar, which some are trying to represent as of no commercial interest and devoid of population, I have already mentioned above that the Consular Report No. 4986 gives the population of that district as 1,500,000 (out of the total population of Persia of 9,000,000, of which 2,500,000 must be taken as nomadic population, see the “ Statesman’s Year Book.”) The following extract from Chamber’s “Encyclopaedia, 1901” (vol. viii, p. 64), may interest you :— “ Although so much of Persia is desert some parts of the country are of exceeding fertility and beauty ; the immense valleys—some of them 100 miles in length between the various ranges of the Kerman Mountains—abound with the rarest and most valuable vegetable productions.” Surely this cannot be called a desert country, and where it is desert, as in some parts to the north-east from Yezd and Kerman, there are mines of nickel, cobalt, antimony, mauganese, and borax (see “ Stateman’s Year Book ”). Again, the climatic conditions are all in favour of Chahbar as against Bunder Abbas, the former being open to refreshing south-west winds, whereas the latter is a typical garmisir with a hot and very depressing summer from April to October (see “ Encyclopaedia Britannica,” 9th edition).

The delay which has occurred in the su emission of our reply has been due to a series oi unfortunate obstacles. In the first place, the question had to be referred to an Inter-Departmental Committee, whose divergent commercial and military views un avoidably prolonged the discussion. In the second place, when this Committee’s report was almost completed the President, Clark, went down with enteric fever and was unable to resume work until just before the Viceroy went on tour. Then with the Viceroy absent and the Council scattered all over India it was impossible to lay this important report before tlem. Then, as soon as the Council had reassembled at Delhi, came the Viceroy's unfortunate accident which prevented his doing any business.

We have the honour to enclose a copy of a report of an Inter-departmental Com mittee which has examined the various points dealt with by Mr. Webb and also certain other questions connected with the proposed railway. (a) That Bandar Abbas is the only port on the littoral which affords satisfactory shelter during the monsoon months, but at other seasons of the year it is doubtful whether any other port in the Gulf possesses intrinsic merits sutficient to effect the question of alignment in any large degree. (b) On purely military and naval grounds a direct alignment vid Yezd and Bandar Abbas is infinitely preferable to any other, but the objections to Kerman being linked up to such alignment by a bianch line from Bahramabad or Saidabad are not so serious as to preclude our acceptance. (c) If, however, the Bandar Abbas line is not adopted then the mouth of the Dasht river in Gwettar Bay will be found more suitable than any other port on the southern littoral—a special advantage of the Dasht river being that it is in British territory.2 I f {d) That on commercial grounds the Bampur-Kerman route is the best, especially as a recent railway reconnaissance shows that this route is feasible at a reasonable cost. That as regards the northern portion of the railway an alignment through Ispahan or the connection of that pla-ce with the mam line by the shortest feasible branch line is desiiable. (f) The site of the break of gauge should be situated as far from India as possible and located not nearer than the middle of the neutral sphere. (a) That a 3' 3f' gauge on the southern section of the railway should be adopted as most suitable on military and financial grounds. (h) That the main line throughout Persia should be international and that the construction and working of the section from Karachi up to the Persian border as well as of the suggested branches between Bigan and Bandar^ Abbas and Bampur and Sistan, respectively, should be in British hands. 3- It will be seen that for the reasons stated in theii report, the Com mittee have gone somewhat further than the immediate points raised by JVii\ Webb and have re-examined in the light of fuller information now in our possession, the general question of alignment, On this question, as the^ report shows, the issue is practically reduced to a conflict between commercial con siderations which demand the alignment via Kerman, and military consider ations which demand the alignment Bandar Abbas. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief considers that the construction of this railway will entail increased military responsibility on India, but if a railway cannot he resisted in the Russian and neutral spheres of Persia, he is of opinion that the Bandar Abbas alignment is the least objectionable on military grounds, and although there are military objections to a branch line to Kerman this might be agreed to, provided this concession is necessary to secure the alignment of the main line being taken via Bandar Abbas. As regards the extension from Bandar Abbas to Karachi, a metre gauge line along the coast would, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief thinks, be the least objectionable. If the main line ended at Bandar Abbas, it would do so at a point which we might reasonably hope to control by naval and military measures well within our power, while this solution will meet the chief com mercial interests of the countries concerned and still leave a natural barrier of 800 miles of difficult country between it and Karachi. His Excellency is, therefore, on military grounds, opposed to this extension being made, but if this cannot be resisted, he considers the coast alignment from Bandar Abbas to Karachi the least objectionable of all those that have been suggested. 4. We cannot help feeling some doubt whether in view of the facts put forward by the Commander-in-Chief as to the forces required to resist a Russian advance in Afghanistan, it would be possible to spare even the amount of troops required for effective operations against an advance between Bandar Abbas and Karachi. If this were so, it has been argued that military considerations might be altogether abandoned. There are, however, certain factors involving some measure of uncertainty, as for instance the eventual decision of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the location of a naval base at the mouth of the Gulf in regard to which Your Lordship recently consulted us, and the exact attitude of the Admiralty in the matter of naval operations along the Mekran Coast. Until we have full information as to the intentions of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the naval and military measures they are prepared to adopt at the entrance of the Persian Gulf and the measures which the Admiralty would be prepared to take in the event of war in regard to the coast line from Bandar Abbas to Karachi, we scarcely feel ourselves in a position to commit ourselves definitely to an opinion as to the two alignments proposed. We would prefer, therefore, to deal w r ith the question as a whole including the other points raised by Mr. Webb and the subsidiary r3 * questionj&gt;examined by the Committee, when we have received information from Your Lordship on these aspects of the case. We have the honour to be, My Loed Maeqtjis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants,~’T LJ (Confidential.) l) Third Report of the Inler-departmental Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. Introduction .—The Committee met to consider a memorandum drawn up by the Hon’ble Mr. M. de P. Webb, C.I.E., Chairman of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce, on the question of the most suitable port on the coast for the debouchment of the proposed Trans-Persian Railway upon the sea-board, which the Secretary of State had forwarded to the Government of India for an expression of their views. The Committee was also directed by His Excellency the Viceroy to consider certain other questions connected with the Trans-Persian Railway, viz .:— (a) The gauge of the railway (within the British sphere of influence). (/;) The place where the break of gauge should be located. (c) The agency for construction of the portion beyond our frontier but within our sphere of influence. The Committee on the present occasion had the advantage of the presence and opinions of Eield-Marshal Lord Nicholson, and also of Mr. Wh A. Johns, who, with his staff, has recently investigated a number of routes between the Anglo-Persian frontier and Bampur, Regan and Sistan. Trclminart/.—Before dealing with the specific questions placed before them, the Committee wish to state that certain fresh developments have occurred which have necessitated reconsideration of some of the opinions expressed in their two previous reports. The Indian military authorities adhere to the view expressed in those reports that the best alignment in British and Indian interests is that via Yezd and Bandar Abbas. The position, however, has been considerably altered as a result of the reconnaissances recently carried out by Mr. Johns. It will be remembered that, on the information then before them, the Committee thought that the route via Bandar Abbas, though the longest, was likely to prove the cheapest in construction and working, and that a line from Chakbar to Kerman via Bampur and Bam would present serious difficulties which would more than outweigh the advantages derived from the shorter distance to be traversed. They also considered that the route suggested as a compromise in their second report via Eurg and Ramishk to Chahbar would prove more economical than that via Kerman. The investigations carried out by the reconnaissance engineers have shown, however, that a feasible and comparatively inexpensive alignment, similar m its general features to that suggested by the Secretary of State m his despatc of he 18th August 1911, is obtainable through Bampur, Bam and Kerman (leaving the coast in the vicinity of Chahbar). The possible economy of taking the route via Bandar Abbas or via Furg has thus ceased to be a feature in t ic case which the Indian Government could urge. The results of the reconnaissances also affect considerably the position m regard to Kerman, whose exclusion from the through route the Committee had urged, on military grounds, in their second report. They now cannot but recognise that the facts disclosed in the reconnaissance reports as to the feasibility of the direct alignment through Kerman will make it less easy to resist the pressure which may be expected from commercial bodies m favour of this direct alignment, which will have the further commercial advantage of taking the railway through an important trade centre. The ball has already been started by the letter from the Karachi Chamber of Commerce who arc of course thinking mainly of Karachi’s special interests. lield-Marshal Lotd Nicholson expressed an opinion as to the practical impossibility of omitting Kerman, and the futility of pursuing such a policy. It, for instance, the line I I Inc2 were carried direct from Yezd to Bandar Abbas, he pointed out that it would be only a matter of time before Kerman was linked up with it by a branch line. Commercially the advantages of including Kerman are indisputable, now that it can be shown that the construction of this route can be carried out economi cally. If the main line is carried through Kerman, it will not only tap the important trade centres within the British sphere of influence, but also reach the coal, manganese and other deposits, said to be abundant in the neutral zone just north of Kerman. These would otherwise be an object of ambition upon the part of our rivals whose claim to entry could scarcely be opposed. Alternatively, if the Yezd-Bandar Abbas alignment is adopted, the Kerman district could be linked up with the railway by a branch line from say, Saiadabad, or it misrht be found feasible to carry the line from Yezd through Anar to Bahramabad and thence to Bandar Abbas, Kerman being linked up by a branch line from Bahramabad. This would involve a slight but not very serious detour and would still tap the resources of the country round Kerman. In these circumstances, the Committee have carefully considered whether they could safely modify the opinion expressed in their second Report against the main line being taken through Kerman, Regan and Bampur down to the coast near Chahbar, and they have also considered the probable effect of Kerman being linked up with the Bandar Abbas alignment by a branch line joining the main alignment at Bahramabad or Saidabad. As regards the main alignment being taken through Kerman, it was suggested to the Com mittee that the strategic disadvantages of such an alignment could be overcome in some measure by the construction of branch lines from Bandar Abbas to Regan and from Bampur to Seistan, the idea being that the former branch, in the event of the Russians endeavouring to utilise Kerman as a basis for an advance on Seistan, would enable a British force landed at Bandar Abbas to threaten their liank, while the latter in a similar contingency would enable a British force brought up along the railway from Karachi to forestall the necessarily slower advance of the Russians towards Seistan. The latter line, it was pointed out, would run in a north and south direction and therefore would leave un touched the desert area which forms so valuable a barrier between Seistan and Nushki; and it may be added that both these branches would probably be of value commercially. There is thus a considerable primd facie case in favour of the proposal. But it must be remembered that the construction of branch lines threatening an enemy’s line of communication implies, if it is to be effect ive, that there will be troops to operate along them. On this point we may refer to a very valuable Memorandum by the General Staff dealing with the effect of the completion of the Trans-Persian Railway on the defence of India, which we have attached as an Appendix* to this Report. It will be seen that there are grave reasons to doubt whether troops could possibly be available in the event of a Russian attack on India for flanking advances along the proposed branch lines. The Russian preponderance in numbers is so great that they will be able to make their attack simultaneously in Arghanistan from the Oxus against Kabul, and from Kushk via Herat and aia i against Kandahar, as well as along the Trans-Persian Railway. It is a well-known principle that a superior military power will always do everyt uug possible to eularge the theatre of operations if that power conceives that by so doing it will be able to act in superior strength at the ecisive point and at the decisive moment, and it is thus very probable at any rate that the Russians will adopt this method of attack. If they • ° view generally held by British and Indian military authorities is t uit all our immediately available forces w r ould be required to operate agains J 1 ! eu a dvance in Afghanistan, and, in these circumstances, the suggested branch lines will be practically useless. The General Staff also indicate m paragraph 11 of their Memorandum certain detailed objections to the proposal which it is not necessary to enumerate here. Generally speaking, they argue that only sufficient forces could he spared to seize and to hold, as ong as possible, the port at which the railway touches the sea, and subs e qu entl y to th reaten with the mobility conferred by sea power, the reproduced in the duplicate copiesRussian lino of communications along the coast, should they endeavour to advance by the railway. The Greneral Staff point out that such operations could be carried out effectively by a relatively small force. In view of this statement of military policy, the Committee can only conclude that the proposed branches would not afford adequate safeguards in the event of the main line passing through Kerman. As regards the probable effect of Kerman being linked up with the main line if the latter were carried on some other alignment, it is clear from the General Staff’s Memorandum that, in the event of a war with Russia, we should not have sufficient troops available for operations in Persia to prevent a Russian force occupying Kerman sooner or later. It would no doubt be desirable to delay that occupation as long as possible, but, inasmuch as the main line would probably have to pass within 50 miles of Kerman, the delay could not in any case be very great, and the existence or non existence of a branch connecting Kerman with the main line could hardly be considered vital. Our general conclusion, therefore, in regard to the new situation created f by the information laid before us by Mr. Johns, is that while that inform ation, by greatly strengthening the case on its commercial side, will no doubt make it more embarrassing to resist the main line being carried through Kerman, the military arguments, if they are to be accepted, are conclusive j in favour of maintaining opposition to that alignment; but we consider that, j 1 if pressed, the Government of India need not very strongly oppose the linking up of Kerman by a branch with the main line. Mr. Johns’ recon naissance also affects unfavourably the case for the compromise alignment via Purg and Ramishk to Chahbar, recommended in the Committee’s second Report. The question of alignment, therefore, practically resolves itself into a con flict between the commercial considerations which demand that the main line should go via Kerman, and the military considerations which demand an align ment via Yezd and Bandar Abbas. Wc feel that large questions of military policy are scarcely within the scope of this Committee, but we cannot take » the responsibility of recommending that commercial considerations should be allowed to outweigh military requirements as stated by the responsible authorities. We would wish to add that, wffiile the position as explained in the i Memorandum—namely, that only sufficient troops would probably be available for operations against a Russian advance in Persia from the sea—strengthens the case for Bandar Abbas from the point of view of Indian defence, it carries with it the corollary that naval co-operation in hostilities will be of vital im portance. The Committee observe that the Admiralty have stated their inability to guarantee the provision of ships for operations in the Persian Gulf in the event of war. They consider that the question of what assistance could be given by the Admiralty in the provision of escorts for transports, &amp;c., for which the more modern type of ship would hardly be required, should be taken up with them in relation to the possibility of combined naval and military opera tions being necessary, in the case of war with Russia, along the Mekran littoral. Indian interests are not so much concerned in the alignment of the rail- ( way beyond Yezd, hut the Committee would take this opportunity of pointing out the advisability, on commercial grounds, of carrying the main line through Ispahan, or, if this is impossible, of linking that place with the main line by the shortest possible branch. With these preliminary remarks the four subjects under reference are now dealt with seriatim. I.—Me. Webb’s memoeandum on the most suitable poet. It may be remarked at the outset that Mr. Webb is a well-known exponent of the merits of the direct route through Kerman, and his views as to the shortcomings of Bandar Abbas cannot be regarded as free from a suspicion of bias.4 He describes Bandar Abbas as an open roadstead offering no natural advantages and providing no facilities for the creation of an efficien harbour He points out the difficulties that obtain as regards lightering and the lack of a sufficient supplv of fresh water in its vicinity. For these reasons, Mr H ebb urges the entire abandonment of Bandar Abbas so far as the Trans-Persian Bailway is concerned, and suggests either Chahbar Bay or Pasm as a more suitable spot at which the railway should strike the coast line. We are unable to agree with Mr. Webb in his wholesale condemnation of Bandar Abbas. Its defects as a port, which we fully recognised when recommending the Karachi-Bandar Abbas alignment to the Government of India, are common in a greater or less degree to all the ports on the south- eastern Persian littoral. Its one outstanding merit, which Mr. Webb has failed to appreciate, and which gives it an advantage cvei all the other ports mentioned bv him, is that its roadstead, which affords anchorage to a large number of vessels, is safer in all weathers than any other port on this shallow and exposed coast, and is also more subject to the controlling power of our fleet. Moreover, it is not impossible that events in Persia and the Persian Gulf may make it necessary for us to strengthen our hold on the Gulf, by the occupation of a naval base therein, and if such were the case a position in the vicinity of Bandar Abbas would probably he selected; the Admiralty wirwnl/l nr» rlrmlif prvnsiiltpd OH this noint. In this connection we would call attention to a note from Mr. Johns, dated 1st August, which is printed among the enclosures to this Report. In a recent visit to Chahbar, Gwettar, Gwadur and Pasni on board the cable-ship “ Patrick Stewart Major Hopkins and Mr. Varvill found that the lightering of heavy cargo in the monsoon would be impossible at any of these four ports, and generally that the degree of shelter afforded was unsatisfactory. It is clear from this that during the monsoon Bandar Abbas has considerable advantages over the other ports. At other seasons of the year it can hardly be said that any port on this littoral can claim a pre-eminence over the others on the score of its intrinsic merits sufficient to affect the question of alignment in any large degree. If the route via Bandar Abbas is not adopted, and the railway follows an alignment via Kerman similar to that suggested by the Secretary of State in his despatch of 18th August 1911, we consider, so far as our knowledge goes at present, that the choice lies between Chahbar Bay and the mouth of the Dasht river in Gw r ettar Bay. Of these two places the Dasht river mouth appears on the whole to be the better. The water-supply at Chahbar is scanty and the surrounding country produces little or nothing. The Dasht river site, on the other hand, possesses a good w T ater-supply, and it has the advantage of a large tract of culturable land in its immediate vicinity. We understand that an irrigation project for bringing water to this area is under consideration, and, if carried out, would give this place far greater advantage in the matter of ; supplies, Ac., than any of the other places mentioned by Mr. Webb. It also has the advantage of lying in British territory, to wffiich we attach great importance. In arriving at this decision, we have been guided to a great extent by the observations of Mr. W. A. Johns, who in the cold weather undertook a careful examination of the Persian and Mekran coasts. He informs us that a rough survey of the mouth of Dasht river has been attended with satisfactory results. It has been ascertained that there is a depth of seven feet of water on the bar at the mouth of the river, with from 12 to 8 feet of water inside at low-water spring-tides. The channel appears easy and straight and the deep-w r ater extends up to the banks of the river thus rendering the construction of jetties both easy and inexpensive. The conditions for lightering are, therefore, favourable in ordinary weather, but unless and until a ship channel is dredged through the bar and up the river, it will be necessary for ships to lie out in the bay. In the monsoon, as we have recorded above, the harbour appears to be virtually impracticable, but Chahbar is very nearly, if not quite, as bad. The whole question, however, requires further investigation which is being undertaken. «II.— Location of break of gauge. In the first report submitted on the 8th February 1911 by this Committee, we expressed the opinion that, from the point of view of the security of India* the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone in Persia should be different from that of the line passing through the Russian zone, and recommended Bandar Abbas as the most suitable place at which this break of gauge should take place. The Government of India have since received a letter from the Karachi Chamber of Commerce in which they protest against this proposal, and urge, on commercial grounds, that the break of gauge should not be allowed to occur at any point south of the Russian sphere of influence. The views of the Committee have been invited on this letter as also on the question of the gauge to be adopted on the southern section of the line from the point where the break of gauge occurs. In reviewing the reasons which led to our former recommendation, we have come to the conclusion that the military importance of having the break of gauge on or near the coast line is not so great as we were at first led to believe; neither do we feel sanguine that it would be possible to insist, as one of the conditions of the building of the througli Persian Railway, that the break of gauge station should be in a locality which could be seized and fortified by our troops, though this, if possible, would be desirable. This being so, we are of opinion that the site of the break of gauge should be situated as far from India as possible. Our reason for advancing this view is that it will add as great a mileage as is possible to the length of line of which the enemy must convert the gauge to his own, and on which he must provide an adequate supply of rolling stock before he can make full use of it. This reason assumes that, to prevent a sudden seizure by the enemy of a ? large amount of rolling stock, it should be clearly stipulated that the line should be so worked that only such stock as was required for daily use would be retained at the break of gauge station at any time. We consider, therefore, that the site for the break of gauge should be situated as far as possible inside Persia, sbe., not nearer than in the middle of the neutral sphere. III. —The gauge of the Southern Section. We will now consider the question as to what is the most suitable gauge for the southern section of the line. In the first place, we may, perhaps, assume that Russia will press for the adoption of her 5'-0' gauge throughout the whole route from Baku to Karachi, as this would be of great commercial and strategic advantage to her both in the peaceful introduction of her products and by enabling the rolling stock and plant of all existing railways of Russia to be used on this line. It is clear, therefore, that, from a British military point of view, a break of gauge is essentially necessary, and, to render the conyersipn of the line as difficult as possible for an enemy in the event of war, it is important that our gauge should be the narrowest permissible. Turning now to the financial aspect of the question, we find that the constructioif of the broad gauge line could not be justified on any estimate of the probable traffic offering, and there is every reason for urging that the cost should be kept as low as possible provided the line is capable of carrying the traffic that it will have to deal with. Military and financial reasons, therefore, unite in pointing to the southern section of the line being constructed for as long a length as possible on a narrow gauge. The gau^e that we consider the most suitable on all grounds is the metre, S'-S 3 -' gau^e? The adoption of this gauge, of which several thousand miles have already been constructed in India, and which has been carried to within100 miles of Karachi, has an undoubted advantage from a military point of view In the event of hostilities, we should be able to call on all the Indian metre gauge lines if it were found that the existing stock On the Persian Kailway was insufficient. jy # Agency eor the Construction of the Southern Section. It now remains to consider the question of the agency by which the southern section of the railway is to be constructed. While fully alive to the economic and other advantages of the course laid down as condition II in Lord Morley’s letter, dated 6th April 1911, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (under which, while admitting foreign capital to the extent of placing abroad a certain proportion of contracts for materials and rolling stock, the actual construction and working of the section in the British sphere is to be entirely in British hands) and while we strongly recommend this course in the case of all branches within our sphere, we venture to submit what appear to us cogent reasons for making an excep tion in the case of the through route. To advocate the division of the main line (for purposes of construction and working) into national sections is, we consider, open to the very serious objection that it would tend tow 7 ard the partition of Persia, an issue which we understand His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are anxious to avoid. Internationalisation of the Line of railway throughout Persia, though not necessarily securing the integrity of Persia, would, through its solidifying influence, exercise a deterrent effect on its disintegration. North of Persia, Russia will presumably make and maintain the line to Astara, and it should be clearly understood and laid down that the construction and working of the section from Karachi up to the Persian border must be entirely in British hands, as w ell as all branches within our sphere of influence. Y.—Conclusions. 1. So far as we can judge from the information before us, Bandar Abbas is the only port on the littoral which affords satisfactory shelter during the monsoon months; but at other seasons of the year w T e doubt whether the intrinsic merits of any port on the Persian coast are sufficiently pre-eminent to affect the question of alignment in any large degree. Bandar Abbas, however, besides being the best sheltered from the monsoon is the most extensive and most easily dominated by our fleet, but, if the Bandar Abbas route is not adopted, then the mouth of the Dasht river in Gwettar Bay will, it is believed, be found more suitable than any other port—such as Cbahbar—on the southern littoral. A special advantage of the Dasht river site would be that it is in British territory, a consideration to which we attach great importance. Further investigations are being made into the rival merits of the different ports. 2. The recent railway reconnaissance seems to show the feasibility at a reasonable cost of the Bampur-Kerman route, and the Karachi Chamber’s letter indicates that it is likely to be strongly pressed for on commercial grounds. TV e think, however, that the military considerations set forth in the General Staff’s Memorandum attached to this Report preclude our recommend ing that the mainline should be carried through Kerman; but we do not consider that the Government of India need, if pressed, very strongly oppose proposals, if such are put forw ard for linking up Kerman by a branch with the main^ alignment. On the general question of alignment, we consider that the issue is now practically narrowed down to a conflict between com mercial considerations which demand the alignment tid Kerman, and military considerations which demand the alignment via Bandar Abbas. We feel that questions of large military policy scarcely fall within our scope, but, so far as this Committee is concerned, we cannot take the responsibility of re commending that commercial considerations should be allowed to outweigh military requirements as laid dow n by the responsible authorities.3. As regards the northern portion of the railway, we recommend that the Government of India should press for an alignment through Ispahan, or the connection of that place with the main line by the shortest feasible branch line. 4. We consider that the site of the break of gauge should he situated as far from India as possible, and that it should be located not nearer than in the middle of the neutral sphere. 5. We are in favour of th» metre, 3'-3|', gauge for the southern section of the railway as being the most suitable on military and financial grounds. 6. We consider that the main line throughout Persia should he inter national, and that the construction and working of the section from Karachi up to the Persian border, as well as all branch lines that may be constructed in the British zone, should be in British hands. Lastly, we would express our thanks to Pield-Marshal Lord Nicholson for kindly attending our meeting and for giving us the benefit of his valuable advice. We understand that, though not entirely endorsing the views expressed j in the General Staff Memorandum, he concurs in our conclusions. Similarly j we are greatly indebted to Mr. W. A. Johns for his attendance and for the invaluable information which he was able to put before us from his personal knowledge of the country. W. H. Clark. * P. Lake, Lieutenant-General. T. B. Wynne. A.

For, granting that the mutual efforts and „o 0 d will of Russia and Great Britain may succeed in preserving the autonomy of Persia, that country is not, nor is it probable that she ever will be, in the position of a strong neutral, with power to prevent the violation of her territory, or even to offer any material resistance to the passage of armies through her dominions. Consequently, from a military point of view, the direct result of the proposed railway will be to increase very considerably the power of Russia to develop military force on the North-West Frontier of India ; and this increase of power, however improbable war may appear at the pre sent time must of necessity cause us to modify largely our existing plans for the defence of India. ] In order to arrive at a correct appreciation of the changes which will be involved by the project m general and by the alternative alignments under discussion m particular, it is first advisable to outline 1 the existing state of affairs as regards the conditions of a war with Russia in defence of the North-West Frontier of India. 9 We may deal first with the strength of the Russian Army and its power of developing ^ f orce i n Central Asia. The peace strength of The Russian Army and power of operat- ^ j^ uss i an ^nny was, in 1908, estimated at some ing in Central Asia. 1,294,000 men„ with a war strength of 5,000,000 of aU tfa°^e“ enfrTorgLtT '^ 0 ! to reorganisation are noi available, but it is known that the result has been to augment the numbers available for the Field Army. ^ . . . The newer of Russia to operate in Central Asia must depend on the international situation at the tto and on the attitude of the countries with which she has contiguous land frontiers, viz., Germany, Austria, Roumania, Turkey, China and Japan. , ^ heinff engaged in a war with one or more of the great military powers Of Europe 6 it may 1“^ - serious advance against India is likely 0,1 her part.

In this connection the existence of the Anglo Japanese alliance and of the Ang 1 .o-Russian Convention have not been forgotten but it mu &amp; t be and ot^ne A g r ail w av under discussion cannot mature for a number of “tfwfflten remato l permanent feature in the international situation.

Were Great Britain at war with Russian operations in Afghanistan. Afghanistan on two l ues simultaneously; viz., from the Oxus against Kabul, and from Kushk via Herat and Earah against Kandahar. S189GSB(I f :■; i; %h;l Jml The question of the force Russia could develop on each of the above lines has naturally been a subject of much study on our part, and various estimates have been made from time to time. The latest conclusions reached by the General Staff in India, which do not differ greatly from the results arrived at by Lord Kitchener and the Imperial General Staff in 1905, are as fol lows :— On the Northern line Russia might operate from the passes of the Hindu Kush towards Kabul with some 65,000* men some 8| months from the date of her mobilization; but even if successful in occupying Kabul with these forces, the limitations of supply would prevent any further advance in force against India, until a railway had been made over the Hindu Kush, which could not be completed for traffic with n the probable duration of a war. On the Southern line towards Kandahar, Russia might deploy some 100,000 men on the Farah Rud, with a further force of 40,000-^55,000 on the Khash Rud, in about 7 months from mobilization. The further advance of these troops would depend on the rate of railway construction in their rear, and it has been estimated that a Russian railway might be laid to the Helmand in 15 months from the commencement of work at Kushk post. The number of men that could be supported would depend on the efficiency of the line. In an unproductive country, one train of the normal capacity on the Central Asian Railway can deliver supplies for all the requirements of about 50,000 men for one day. With a running capacity of 5 or 6 trains each way per diem the Russians could thus maintain from 250,000 to 300,000 men at railhead. 4. If we turn now to the British plans and power to meet the above contingencies, We find that it has been accepted by the Committee A British plans and power of operating in 0 f i m p er i a l Defence that the best line for us to occupy for the defence of India against Russia is that known as the Kabul-Kandahar line. As regards the means at our disposal for such operations we have— (а) The army in India. (б) Oversea reinforcements. (а) At the present time the army in India is organized in 9 Divisions and 8 Cavalry Brigades for active operations, giving a gross total of some 160,000 men, assuming that Im perial Service troops could be used to their full extent, and after allowing for the approved internal security troops. (б) The number of oversea reinforcements that may b &gt;, available for the defence of India will depend on the international situation at the time and cannot be foretold with any degree of accuracy. It has been estimated, however, that under the most favourable circumstances, using the whole striking force of the Empire and with no other external complications, reinforcements, including contingents from the self-governing Dominions, might be available as under:— At the end of 6 months At the end of 12 months At the end of 18 months Total Men. 58,0)0 8 &gt;,000 54,000 197,000 m addition to drafts to replace wastage and not including followers. This is a total very unlike- y to be reached, and owing to the difficulties of equipping them with suitable transport and followers, it is doubtful if more than half the above numbers would be available for acti ve ^ ^ ie a ^ ove dates; so as not to understate the case however two-thirds or l dd,iuo, have been assumed as possible, or including the Indian scale of followers and transport attendants 177,000. { 5, As regards our power of deployment on the selected line, it is calculated that were the ” British operations in Afghanistan. Afghans friendly, we could put 4 Divisions and £ , t , i , , ^ tt i i • i ^ Cavalry Brigades, a total of 74,000 men into the n an f ?,bout ^ ul m about 4 months from British mobilization.

On the southern line, with the help of a railway, which it is anticipated could reach Kandahar m 3 and the Helmand in 5 months from the commencement of construction, we should be able to support the balance of the Indian Field Army together with the oversea reinforcements noted above as they arrive on and in advance of the Helmand. That is to say, under favourable circumstances as regards the arrival of reinforcements, and after deducting the troops nece sary to hold the line of communications, some 120,000 in six, 195,000 in twelve and 243,000 men in eighteen months from British mobilization. ' Compared' with the estimate of Russian development given in paragraph 3, this gives us not far from an approximate equality at each stage. But it leaves no spare forces available to operate on any other line of advance without risking defeat by superior numbers on the Helmand. We may, of course, if the Afghans are friendly and inclined to view us as allies, expect to oRa n some material assistance from their forces, but th s is uncertain and it has been deemed safer not to reckon upon it. ' tlo Ccmt it line ion I against I® i and 8 U[ .ling ill b r tie apts circuit® Is, m 8jf) 6. We may now consider the changes which will ensue on the completion of the Effect of completion of Trans-Persian Rail- Trans-Persian Railway. The most important way. of these is that, in order to use to the full her pre ponderating military strength, Russia may be expected to operate against India on all three available lines, viz., the two discussed above and the new line which Will then be available through South Persia. Indeed it may be accepted that a superior military power will always do everything possible to extend the theatre of operations, in the same manner as the inferior power will endeavour to reduce the front on which operations will take place, in order to prevent her enemy from deploying her superior forces. Especially is this extension probable in the case under discussion, for the line of communications of a force operating along the Trans- Persian Railway would be entirely separate from thet of forces operating in Afghanistan, which latter would be based on the Tashkent and Central Asian Railways and could be worked independently. The question of the peace measures necessary for the safety of India on the completion of the Trans-Persian Railway will be a matter for the decision of the Imperial and Indian Governments at the time, but it appears clear that there must be a considerable increase to the Army in India. 7. As regards Russian action' in the event of War, the following appear the salient Development of Russian strength on Trans- poin s for consideration. The number of men Persian Railway. whom ths Russians could support and the rate at which they could be concentrated at any given point along the new railway will depend on its efficiency, and this cannot be accurately gauged until the project is completed. As, however, it will have been laid in peace and be in working order before war commences, it i=&lt; fair to assume that its capacity will be greater than that of the line from Herat towards the Helmand referred to in paragraph 3. A fair estimate of its capacity for supply may, there ore, be anything from 300,000—400,000 men. As regards rate of concentration, the estimated capacity of the Merv-Kushk Railway for concentrating troops is 90,000 men a month ; and given an equal capacity for the new railway the Russians might concentrate some 200,000 men at any given point (say m the neutral zone) within 4 months from the outbreak of war-probably not greater numbers, because, as supply trains increase, the rate of concentration diminishes. A study of our resources, as outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5, will show that, even if we could afford to neglect advances from other directions, which, as has been shown, is impracticable, it would be impossible for us to oppose to this force anything like equal numbers at any place m the interior of Persia. 8. The best means of meeting this danger would then appear to be— Defensive measures. (i) to ensure that the point at which the Russians could safely concentrate is as fa r from our frontiers as possible; («) to take steps to render their subsequent advance a yl^ n f,f ® C ''h a ' without, in the first instance, attempting to opposeffcectlyUthn force at a dis an from our base. The fulfilment of the above conditions must largely depend on * h ®, or the projected railway, and we may now discuss the advantages of the alternative I g nents, viz., Yazd-Bandar Abbas-Karachi and Yazd-Kirman-Bam-Gwattar-Karaclu ight of the opportunities they offer for the defensive measures indicated above. 9. In the ease of the first of the Til Bandar Abbas alignment. bo SVLC ^ a - to prevent the seizure by a hostile 'x&gt;up-de-main of the port at which it first touches the coast. In this event, the Russ p1 i-i iv w of fhp break of gauge or near Saidabad, out of reach of of concentration would pro 7 serious check to theix advance other than our power for mterfereuce from the coast, m to ^ wheie&gt; ^ the ^ o{ that caused by changing g g . | y an( j reinforcement by sea at all seasons of the field fortification time. Even by constructing a deviation year, we ^^h^op® position ; for, with command of the sea, we should betnZmsitSn lo attack their communications here with a considerable force should we so It may be objected that our previous reasoning has shown that no such force is at desire, it m J J cleai ^ t]ie com pletion of this railway will necessitate a wry large IncCse^o our a^med force in India, part of which might be made available for snchanopera- tion and many case we should have the option of diverting oversea reinforcements to Bandar Abbas should the situation give promise of an adequate success in this theatre of operations. BnsX must, therefore, stop to capture the place or mask it with such a large force as to render SXr advance much less formidable. We must however, in the absence of fortifier^on on a very lame scale, be prepared to face the abandonment or loss of Bandar Abbas after a certain period of time. After its capture, however, the Russians would still have to advance for 800 miles along the coast before reaching Karachi; and their communications Iw the whole route would be exposed to. our enterprises from the sea. The modus. Lerandi ” for such operations would be, while lightly holding delaying positions m their front across the line, constantly to threaten and interrupt their communications by landing parties at nointsin rear of their advance ; and this might even take the form, should favourable oppor- tunity offer of landing a considerable force and holding a defensive position across the line for some days The mobility conferred by sea power would enable us to threaten, or even landmen, simultaneously at several points and to carry on a continuous series of attacks on the railway. Moving along a coast, practically devoid of supplies and deficient in water, and therefore entirely dependent on the railway for existence, their army would be peculiarly sensitive to such an offensive. The destruction of an important bridge or any temporary success on our part would cause serious delay to their advance, while any considerable success might threaten their army with starvation. It will, therefore, be seen that the Russians must detach very large numbers to guard against these dangers, thus reducing their striking power, while in any case their advance must be a slow operation. 10. In the case of the second alternative alignment, with the line reaching the coast at „ ^ Chahbar or the mouth of the Dasht river, the Chahtar or wa ar a ign Russians would as before probably concentrate at the break of gauge or perhaps even as far as Kirman. Our action in seizing and defending the port would be the same as in the case of Bandar Abbas. There would, however, be a great difference in this respect, that the- Russians would now be able to advance quietly and deliberately past Kirman, on to Bam, Regan, Bampur, and as far at least as Geh or Kasrkand, consolidating their position as they advanced, before we could seriously interfere with thorn : the reasons for this view are given in paragraph 11. The capture of the port, whether Chahbar, or Gwattar, from us would, on arriving in the vicinity, be the next consideration for the Russians. This Would, however, be a distinctly easier task, than in the case of Bandar Abbas, because, not having at either place a secure and extensive anchorage behind us suited for all weathers, we should be nervous about holding on too long and not being able to re-embark our troops, and so be mare ready to'give up possession. Subsequent to its capture, our action would be on the lines indicated in paragraph 9. The great difference, to our disadvantage, however, !n this case would be that the length of communications exposed to our attack would now be reduced by half and the Russian detachments necessary to guard them correspondingly diminished. Moreover, the coast from Chahbar eastwards is more exposed to the monsoon than that between Bandar Abbas and Chahbar, and it is unlikely that any landing operations on the former section would be feasible from June to September. 11. It has been suggested that, with a railway from Bandar Abbas to Regan, we should be in a position to delay a Russian advance along this Bandar Abbas-Regan Railway. second alignment, by operating from Bandar Abbas against their line of communications in the vicinity of Regan. This is feasible to a certain extent, but the plan is open to the following objections :— (i) The operation, extending as it would 200 miles inland, would require the provision of a considerable force to guard the line of communications alone. This force under the circumstances we should be unable to spare without risking defeat at the point of contact, unless We could land a very large expedit on. (ii) The destination and objective of the force would be obvious, and it could only strike the hostile line of comm.nnications in the vicinity of a known point, consequently the attack could not come as a surprise. (m) The passage of the mountains to the south-west of Regan, even if the line had not been already destroyed or obstructed by the enemy, would be difficult in the faceof opposition, and should our forces succeed in this, our own communications with Bandar Abbas would be exposed to a counter-movement from the neighbourhood of Kirman. (iv) On the threat making itself felt the Russians could concentrate troops by rail from north and south simultaneously to meet it, without the danger of exposing other points of their line as would be the case on the coast. Our force would thus be exposed to the possibility of encountering superior numbers. 12. The construction of a line from Bampur to Sistan, though it might enable us to forestall Bampur-Sistan Railway. the Russians in the occupation of the latter djs- tnct, would be of no strategical advantage. For We could not spare any considerable force for Sistan, and, on the Russians advancing in force on Bampur, which they might do in 3 or 4 months from the outbreak of the war, our detachment in Sistan w r ould be isolated and forced to retire on Nushki or the Helmand, when threatened by superior numbers. It might even be the case that the Russians would ignore such a detachment, whose radius of action could not be great, and in this event its presence in Sistan would serve no useful purpose, but merely reduce our strength at other and more decisive points. The only strategical effect of th's branch would be to give the Russians easy access to Sistan. by rail from Bampur, and enable them to increase their forces on the Helmand should they so desire. 13. To sum up, our best chance of success in a war with the numerically much superior military power of Russia is to delay the issue as long as possible, in order to allow the peculiar economic and other factors of the Emp : re, whose influence induced the Russians to conclude peace after the Crimean and Manchurian wars, to make themselves felt, and to give us time to develop the latent military strength of our own Empire, to seek allies and utilise the resources of diplomacy. Under existing conditions the Russians are unable to develop very superior forces on our advanced line of defence until after some 15 months from the outbreak of war. It would take them still longer to reach our actual frontiers, and it is not to our interest to decrease this period. The construction of the Trans-Persian Railway must inevitably do this to a great extent, and must also increase the front on which we may have to fight, and thus tend to the dispersion of the forces at our disposal, forces relat vely small even after the increase to the Indian Army wh ch must certainly follow its construction. For the above reasons, if we are to be a party to the construction of the line, it would appear essential to ensure that its alignment shall afford us the best possible opportunities of combating a hostile advance ^along it. To this end the following military advantages are claimed for the alignment via Bandar Abbas as against that via Kirman, Bampur and Gwattar:— (1) That the point at which Russia can concentrate her troops in the first instance will be further removed, by railway, from the frontiers of India. (2) That, owing to the secure and sheltered anchorage, Bandar Abbas offers better facili ties for defence supported by naval power than any other port on the coast from Karachi westwards.* (3) That should the Russians succeed in capturing the port at which the line first reaches the sea, their subsequent advance towards India would expose to our attacks from the sea 800 miles of communications in the case of Bandar Abbas, as against 400 in the case of Chahbar or Gwattar. Moreover, owing to climatic conditions, such operations could be carried out with better chance of success on the section of the coast between Bandar Abbas and Gwattar than on that from Gwattar to Karachi. (4) That with the alignment passing further from Sistan, as would be the case with the Bandar Abbas route, there would be less temptation for the Russians to press subsequently for a railway connection to that district from the interior of Persia, a consummation which it has always been held to be to our interests to avoid. (5) Following on the above considerations, it is estimated that it would take the Russians at least twice as long to deploy large forces on the Baluchistan frontier by an ad vance along an alignment via Bandar Abbas, as it would by advancing along a line via Kirman and Gwattar. Further, owing to the increased length of vulnerable communications, our opportunities for checking the advance will be greater, and consequently the difficulties of the Russian operations and the number of men necessary for their successful accomplishment will be considerably augmented. (6) Lastly, it is thought that, were the line by Kirman and Gwattar available for a Russian advance, its alignment would so shelter this advance that we could not * N 0 te. This opinion is based on the result of discussions with Rear-Admiral Sir E. Slade, R. N., late Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, and the report of Mr. Gleadowe. Newcomen s Commercial Mission in 1904-05.6 hope to interfere with it seriously until the sea was reached at the latter place. If that place or Chahbar were once in Russia’s hands, it is a question whether she would not be content for the moment with that success, and proceed to turn that place into a great fortified port on the open sea, leaving to us the difficulties of taking the offensive at a distance from our base, while she remained in posses sion of Afghan Turkistan, Herat and possibly Sistan. In that case every advan tage would be on her side. 14 An attempt has been made above to forecast the effect of the railway by either align- .. „„ , c nni ment, on the progress of a campaign against Effect of Railway, even i w Russia in defence of India. In the opinion of many people, however, Kussia does not contemplate a direct invasion of India, nor is she Sv now or in the futae to break faith with us. Be th.s as it may, it is morally certain that she will devote her whole energy, short perhaps of risking war, towards improving her strategic position in South Persia. As years go by this will become increasingly apparent to the military advisers of the Government of India and the demands for countervailing measures of security, including large additions to our m’htary forces, will be pressed with Tver-growing insistence on the Government of India, the Home Government and the British Public. Whether this apprehension is justified or not, it will make itself felt and the result in any form is sure to impose an additional burden on Indian finances. This burden cannot be estimated, but it Ly safely be predicted that it will be enormously greater if the first port of the Trans-Persian Railway, towards which the Russian overland advance would be directed, is 400 miles from the Indian frontier instead of 800 miles. It is probable that Russia will, in view of the great material advantages she would ga : n thereby use every artifice and labour assiduously with the objee' of Russianismg if not of obtain ing actual possession of this port, even perhaps to the extent of risking war for this one object alone. The probability of this is, however, far greater in the event of the alignment running through Kirman to the Indian Ocean, than if it ran direct to Bandar Abbas, the Naval as well as Military strategical centre of our power of control of the future commercial and political activities in the Persian Gulf area.

B.—6 9-12.—20.—B.A,Note on the harbours on the Mekran Coast to Chahbar and on the harbour at Bundar Abbas. Th t f ^ \ S • based ! ? U 1 observatlons made during a trip on the “ Patrick htewait to Bush ire and hack, on discussions with the ship’s officers who all know the coast intimately, on subsequent observations made from a British India ship between Chahbar and Karachi and on inspection of the coast during ? c °T) d L er t(mr, Most of tlle informat ion was gained during my tour on * 16 Patrick Stewart,” for the Director, Indo-Persian Telegraphs, very kindlv placed the ship at my disposal, and I was able to cruise round the bavs either in it or one of the ship’s boats, and take soundings close in shore where the large scale charts are rather sketchy. . a s i n &amp;le exception, Gwattar bay which will be dealt with last of all, I visited each of the harbours mentioned in the note, and inspected the shore from both the sea and land sides. My object was principally to determine the best site for lightering and landing railway stores in large quantities from tramp steamers bringing whole cargoes of permanent way, girders, &amp;c.; incidentally, however, the question of the most suitable site for the future commercial port, where the import and export traffic of the Trans-Persian Kailway u ill be dealt with, naturally suggested itself. My observations being taken in the cold weather are far from exhaustive; nothing short of practical experience of lightering cargo from steamers into large barges during a monsoon will tell us all we want to know; but I was fortunate in seeing most of the harbours during a bad “ shimal” and so could form a fair idea of their short comings from the ideal harbour. Before dealing with the harbours seriatim a brief mention of the prevailing winds that cause heavy seas on the coast is desirable. Though storms come from every direction, we need only concern ourselves with two, the monsoon and the shimal. According to the Admiralty “ pilot ”, and the information given me by the officers of the “ Patrick Stewart”, the south-western monsoon which blows for the four months, June to September, gradually diminishes in strength from ^ Karachi westward veering in direction at the same time, till by the time Gwattar is reached, its force is distinctly less and direction southerly. Seventy miles further on, at Chahbar, it is still lighter and direction south-east. The monsoon swell is heavy as far as Gwadur, beyond that it lightens considerably. Landing of men on the beach at the various ports is always possible. Whether it will be found possible to unload and land cargo in large barges during the monsoon still remains to be seen, for the working of the small British India steamers that, owing to their light draught, can take up a more sheltered anchorage than a large tramp is little guide. The lighters that attend them are small country boats and the cargo light—dried fish, matting and wool for the most part. There are times, too, when even the British India steamers are compelled to put to sea without landing or taking in either cargo or passengers. The shimal is the prevailing cold weather gale. Starting as a northerly wind in the Gulf, on the Mekran coast it becomes westerly and causes a heavy sea. The duration of a shimal is generally three days, but it sometimes lasts for seven. I was in Chahbar during a light shimal, and in Pasni and Ormara later on when it had gathered strength. By the ships making a “ lee side ” for the launch we were able to go ashore, but although the “ Patrick Stewart” with a draught of about 12' was able to take up a far better anchorage than a large ship could have done, it would have been impossible to deal with heavy cargo even where we were at anchor. At Ormara, that day, a British India steamer that had some passengers to land, and had from its greater draught to anchor half a mile outside us, had great difficulty and lost hours in getting a dhow along side. Shimals are fairly frequent in the spring months of the year. Bad weather from the south and east during the cold weather is of rare occurrence.2 Dealing with the harbours seriatim, the principal ones on the Mekran littoral are Sonmiani, Ormara, Khur, Kalmat, Pasni, Gwadur, Junri and Gwattar and Chahbar. Sonmiani may he dismissed with tlie remark that, owing to silting up of ^ the foreshore and the lagoon on which it is situate, the port is practically moribund. What is left of its trade has shifted to Damb higher up the lagoon. • Apart from the increasing difficulties of the bar its situation within 60 miles of Karachi prohibits its ever rising again into importance. It is not required as a railway construction base, though we might take an occasional boat load of cement and stores there. Ormara, like Sonmiani in Las Bela territory, consists of a narrow strip of sand terminating in a huge hammer-headed promontory 10 miles long, running at right angles to the spit on which the town is situate. It is this right-angled promontory that gives shelter to the foreshore at the town. Fishing craft are hauled up or anchored on both sides of the spit, but the depth of water and shelter are greater on the east side, where the town is, than in the west bay. Ormara has a population of 3,000 inhabitants and an immense fish ing industry, 200 boats, chiefly canoes, being employed. The trade is princi pally in the hands of Khojas, the chief articles of export being sharks fins, salt fish, and fish bladders for isinglass. In spite, however, of the great length of the promontory the water is so shoal that the anchorage for large ships is exposed both to the monsoon sw r ell and the shimal. A large steamer could not get within four miles of the shore. Moreover, the beach opposite Ormara is very shelving, and, therefore, unsuited for pile jetties for landing railway stores; for such jetties, for rapid working, must project into 6' of water at low water of spring tides, and obviously the more they project from the shore the greater their exposure to damage from the monsoon swell. I was informed that no fishing can be done here during the monsoon, and that spring tides ebbed 150 yards.' Circumstances will probably render it imperative for us to make Ormara a large base for railway material, and for our purpose a much more steeply shelving bit of coast some five miles north of Ormara will probably prove the most suitable for jetties, in spite of its being more exposed to the monsoon swell. Very likely it will be necessary to pull up and lay down our jetties before and after the monsoon. Khor Kalmat is a huge lagoon, with a great depth of water, running into the coast plain and ending in mangrove swamps. But its entrance is narrow and blocked by a bad bar reaching right across it, and leaving only a narrow and difficult channel between itself and the shore, vide sketch. Fishing dhows from Kathiawar and elsewhere are said to use the lagoon occasionally for purposes of trade and fish drying on the shore. The anchorage to seaward is quite unprotected, the channel into the lagoon Is impracticable for steamers, so the harbour, though well sheltered, is useless for railway construction purposes and, in view of its situation, does not appear to have a future. P asni, in the Khan of Kalat’s territory, lies in a half-moon bay facing east. The foreshore obtains an indifferent amount of shelter from the pro montory of Kas Jaddi to the south, but the anchorage for large ships is \ completely exposed to all winds except the north, so lighter work would be #a impossible during the monsoon months and when a bad shimal is blowing. The foreshore is rather too shelving for the economical construction of pile jetties, i.e., I estimate that our pile jetties there for landing railway stores must he at least 100 yards long. As at Ormara, it will very likely be necessary to pull them up and lay them down again before and after each monsoon. The water-supply of Pasni is said to be good. It is at all event much better than that of Ormara. At both places it comes from wells sunk in the sand dunes. But at Pasni there are large pools of water in the Shadi Kaur, some three miles to the north. The trade and population of Pasni are both rising rapidly; its custom receipts are now about half those of Gwadur and are, I believe, levied on a 3 ad valorem basis against the 5 % basis of Gwadur. I make no claim to accuracy, but as far as I could gather the customs and other revenues of the three principal ports, Ormara, Pasni and Gwadur, were, respectively, Ks. 45,000, 22,000 and 45,000 annually, Ormara being on a ten per cent basis. Pasni, though far from an ideal site for a harbour, is capable of improvement by means of dredging and a breakwater; but a large outlay of the kind would only be justifiable if the Trans-Persian Railway were to debouch on the Mekran littoral there—which hardly seems possible—or perhaps if a 2' 6' feeder line were constructed from Pasni through Kech and the ferrile plains of Mand and Peshin, and thence to the Serbaz valley, by no means a difficult undertaking. Gwadur, a possession of the Sultan of Maskat, is still, though threatened by the rise of Pasni, the most important port on the coast. It has a popula tion of 8,000 inhabitants and a considerable trade with the interior in ghi, wool and dates (when prices are favourable). Its principal industry, dried fish, is greater than that of Ormara and Pasni. Its traders are Khojas and Sindhi banias, and they carry on their business with the interior either through agencies in the Qasrqand and Serbaz valleys or by journeys into the interior at shearing time and during the date season when they make their purchases and bring their caravans to the coast. As a port its physical features are precisely similar to those of Ormara and what has been said' of the latter applies equally to the former, that the water in the bay is so shoal that large ships can obtain no protection from the headland that forms the bay. The water-supply is particularly bad and rather scanty. Like Pasni the harbour could be improved, or, more accurately speaking, constructed by means of a breakwater and dredging, but the expense would be very great, and there is the additional difficulty of the territory being an appendage ot Maskat. Givattar bay, Gwattar and Junri .—I did not visit this bay for the lar^e scale chart appeared to show that both Junri and Gwattar, two dimi nutive fishino* hamlets, were utterly useless for railway purposes. Captain Honkim* however, spoke rather highly of the possibilities of Junri as a place for landing stores, so I had some surveys carried out by a very capable European subordinate at a small promontory (marked m red pencil on the accompanying chart, which seemed to offer some promise of shelter for barges and economical jetty construction. His surveys, soundings and report entirely confirmed my original impression. Generally speaking Gwattar bay affords*less shelter to large ships and a more unsuitable foreshore for barges than the other bays dealt with. Chahbar. —I had heard so much of the possibilities of Chahbar from non-professional people that I examined its bay more minutely than the others, bothkom the “ Patrick Stewart ” and later on when I had to spend a day or two there waiting for the British India steamer. Curiously enough nay atten tion was at first more particularly directed to the portion just noith of Tiz poTnt wldch 1 see mentioned b/ Mr. Webb. I had hoped to find a good she for lighter work under the shelter of the point on its northern side, but soundings shewed the correctness of the large scale chart there, and the gieat lenoth it would be necessary to build our jetties to reach a 6 depth at low wafer spring tides. But I found a short stretch of beach just north of tie town where the shore slopes fairly steeply; in fact, a slightly better site for4 short jetties than I found at any other place except at a spot previously mentioned five miles north of Onnara. Broadly speaking, Chahbar possesses one great advantage over all the other bays under note, in the weakness of the monsoon there. Unlike the ports to the east, trade, carried on in country boats, is not at a standstill during the monsoon months. It has, on the other hand, a disadvantage in being speciallv exposed to the force of the shimal. As will be seen from the chart, steamers can anchor much nearer the shore than at Gwadur, Pasni and Ormara, but it also will appear that the anchorage itself is not a whit more sheltered. In dealing with large cargoes of railway material, the distance of the ship from the shore is of very minor importance as compared with the amount of shelter that the anchorage affords to the lighter when alongside the ship. Like the other ports mentioned, Chahbar is susceptible of improvement, but I would be slow to affirm that the outlay in making a port there would be less than at Gwadur or Pasni. The present water-supply is of good quality, but not plentiful. It con sists of wells sunk on the sandy bed of a stream that runs past the town; that it would stand the strain of an additional couple of thousand men which the railway would collect at the base seems open to doubt. Bunder Abbas is little if at all worse as a harbour than the other bays dealt with. It is true that ships must anchor a long way—four or five miles from the shore. On the other hand, the bay is fairly well sheltered from all the prevailing winds. The beach is very shelving, and so jetties of considerable length would be required perhaps 250 yards—to permit of barges coming alongside at all states of the tide. On the other hand, the bay is so sheltered that these jetties would not be liable to destruction by wave action during gales. There is no monsoon there. H iom the foregoing it is quite clear that nothing resembling a good natural harbour can be said to exist on the Mekran coast/ With an adequate expen °f money there is more than one place where a good working port could be built, but without continuous observations at all seasons of the year, and considerable professional knowledge of breakwaters and harbour works, i wou e las or any one to state that one site stands out at all pre-eminentiv beyond the others. r ct ^ Slg i! lt p hah ^ ar seem s to have some slight advantage, but after studying the chart, and remembering the importance of shelter from the ’ am ^ 110 mea | ls cer tain that Pasni and possibly Gwadur might not hrpiaVwatp^ 1 e&lt; P ia .^y suited as a harbour, i.e., at a similar outlay on but n vpWpt^ 11 + m eaC k Case ‘ ^li ere is no large scale chart of Pasni, of /ill t of ^ n. ®p ar f&gt; e sca ^ c h ar t °f Gwadur will show how fine an area A similar ?!n!!fT a ^ er . a a nor t^' eas t direction would enclose, thprp wnnlrl n 1 a r ^ a ^ wa &gt;er at Chahbar would enclose a smaller area, seems to ho mol/ 88 J 10 ^°’ however, but on the other hand, the bottom as soveUa 1 f 11 688 sul ^ e( ^ f 01 ’dredging.

(3) There should be ample stacking ground for material. (4) There should be a well sheltered anchorage for barges close to the jetties, so that there would be no risk of their foundering at their moorings. Having had charge of all the early steamer unloading work on the Uganda Bailway, I have some practical knowledge of what one wants. (5) In addition to these natural advantages, having in view the fact that such a railway base will, if near the debouchment of the line from the Persian hinterland, very likely crystalize into an important city and naval base, the site should preferably be in British than in Persian or Maskat territory. Condition (1), a land-locked roadstead is unobtainable anywhere along the coast between Karachi and Chahbar. But at a spot seven miles up the Dasht river, which discharges its waters in Gwattar bay, we have, I believe, dis covered a place which complies with all the other conditions. The idea of using the Dasht river and Gwattar bay occurred too late for me to be able to visit the place during the past season, but I have had rough surveys of the river made and soundings taken with highly satisfactory results. The surveying officer, a reliable English subordinate, found 7' of water at the bar at low water of spring tides on the 1st May. The channel is easy and straight, and the tide not very rapid. Inside the bar we get 12' of water gradually diminishing to 8' at the spot where the banks first get above high flood level of the river in flood. Here it is proposed to land our railway material. Deep water extends right up to the banks, so jetties will be inexpensive and easily built. The width of the river, speaking from memory, is about a quarter of a mile. Anywhere within the bar there is good anchorage for barges. Eor temporary purposes a good water-supply can be obtained from the river, a few miles higher up above the reach of tides, somewhere near the village of Kumri. Both banks of the river are Kalat, i.e., neither Persian nor Maskat territory. Eleven miles, viz., seven in the river—that may be reducible to three or four by coming nearer the sea—and four from the bar to the ship, is a long distance for towing lighters. Time, however, is not lost in towing, but alongside the ship and° the wharf ; we will require two launches instead of one, that is all. Experience will show whether work can be carried on during the monsoon. Probably not; either there or anywhere else on the coast, except in small quantities. During shimals, I believe there will be sufficient protection for work to go on, as ships will anchor a long way up the bay. In the coming cold weather it is my intention to have a thorough investigation made of the possibilities of the place as well as of the other harbours on the coast. Erom a railway construction point of view the river site has this great advantage that by enabling us to land stores on the west bank of the Dasht river, as well as on the east, we have not to depend for supplies on a temporary bridge over a big river like the Dasht, which would be a very weak link in our chain of communication. Ratber a crucial point is, in the event of there being no flood * in the river during the monsoon months to keep the channel clear, will the entrance get blocked by a bar till the first of the cold weather floods comes down to open it out • I understand that there are generally good rains in the catchment area of this river during the summer months, A.

A line was surveyed along tbe coast plain from Karachi to the Persian frontier at Gabd, 413 miles long, following the coast except for a ghat section behind Ras Malan—from the Hingol to the vicinity of Ormara, about 70 ! —where it runs behind the coast range along a lateral valley. * i.e., to an invader. The vulnerable points* are :— I. The Gadani cliffs, miles 30 to 40 from Karachi, where the 5-fathom line is close inshore. II. Some 20 miles of cliffs just east of Pasni; unfortunately the 5-fathom line at the latter is some distance aw r ay, vide chart. Elsewhere, though the line is close to the coast in places, ir would be open to an enemy to lay in diversions keeping to the foot hills, though such diversions would take time to construct. The plain averages 10 miles in width, but is in places much wider, and the coast is usually shoal. In addition to the above surveys to the Persian frontier, reconnais sances were carried out— (a) by three valleys, Serbaz, Kasrkand and Geh, from the coast plain V beyond the frontier to Bam pur, and thence via the Koh-i-Bazman to Regan, where the cultivated plain of Bam-Regan begins; (5) from the Koh-i-Bazman a branch was reconnoitred successfully through Sarhadd to Robat, vtd the Ear, and thence on to the borders of Sistan ; (c) another branch was reconnoitred from Regan north-eastwards, 7 and a feasible route discovered more or less in the vicinity of the telegraph line to Sistan. Erom Regan to Kerman we have sections and reports of Captain Hopkins, a railway officer, and Mr King Wood, Director, Indo-Persian Telegraphs, showing an easv alignment. The only route between our frontier and Kerman, on the Bampur-Bam-Kerman-Yezd alignment, that we have not explored, is the direct connection across the Lot from Kerman to Sistan. This was obviously so difficult—if feasible at all that it was thought that an enemy would preferably choose the Regan-Nasratabad-Sipi route mentioned above, which was explored with the object of seeing whether it was feasible or not. By the time that was finished, the season was too far advanced tor the direct crossing of the Lut between Kerman and Sistan to be undertaken. Guides refused to conduct the party as the hot wind had begun, and travel become impossible from sandstorms and want of water. But there is little room for doubt, that, witii the existence of the comparatively easy route from Bam or Besran-alon- the old caravan road—to Nasratabad-Sip. and Sistan, an en?mv would not attempt to make a ra.lvvay over the lofty range east of Kerman, and thence across the low-lying waterless Lut. 2 Of the three routes recounoitred from the coast, the Geh route proved IKtS —t rXJnd 0 Kara°chi: the only reaiiy vuiue ^ circumvented by following viz., at the Khaki Kuh ; for the Basni cmr ^ tQ the north!+ and the t a three months’ job.

The above being the results of our surveys and reconnaissances with principal mileages, the following conclusions suggest themselves The objections to any other route than that through Bampur and Kerman appear to be— r (1) Bampur is in itsejf a strong strategic and important political posi tion with some prospect of development. (2) An important place like Kerman with 75,000 inhabitants cannot be ignored commercially. To do so would be to court what we wish tto avoid. Eor inevitably sooner or later the Russians would | press for railway communications between it and Tezd on commercial grounds, fostering petitions from the inhabitants, &amp;c. | (3) The same is true of Sistan. We cannot afford to ignore it; the temptation for Russia to step in would be too great, and we ought not to afford a loophole to assist their entry. With a branch from the Koh-i-Bazman we forestall any arguments about com mercial development. Moreover, a branch of the kind seems to have some military advantages. (4) From the table of mileages above it seems that Russia has a much I easier and better watered line for railway construction from Meshed, via the Helmand, to Nushki than via Regan and Kasratabad-Sipi, and that the Kerman alignment is therefore free from danger to ourselves except in a remote degree. Trom Kermnn light branch lines would take off to khe objections to the Bandar AbbaS Bandar Abbas, Shiraz and Mohauunerah. TOUte tire I.—That it is hopeless commercially for 900 miles to Bandar Abbas, and not much use beyond, except for a connection with Shiraz, which is quire an independent undertaking. II.—That for 900 miles it gives us no political or strategic control of the hinterland. III.—That for the above reason it is insecure. IY.—That by avoiding the important centres within our sphere of influence, Kerman, Bam, Sistan, &amp;c., it offers a strong induce ment for others to step in and take advantage of our inaction, vide (2) and (3) supra. Gauge. —Holding these views as to route, I am in favour both for trade, political and military reasons of having the break of gauge as far north as possible and of building the line by the Indian standard gauge. Should, however, for military and economic reasons, the metre uauge be insisted on, then it seems, for reasons connected with the difficulty of gauge conversion, that there can no longer be any military objections to the direct commercial route. Opinions differ as to the amount of through passenger traffic that will take the trans-Persian Railway between England and the East, but believing , ,« , o S I do that it will in time become very i.e., via Bandar Abbas the question of gauge^ con- k 1 , s ,, ' version by an enemy in time of war does not arise. large flf glVCU qUICK traUSltj tuen It WC are to saddle the through route by an additional 150 miles via Bandar Abbas, for reasons of speed we should adopt the broad gauge. Hesponsibility for Expenditure. One can safely assume that not a mile of railway will be constructed by anv International Company without a guarantee from the controlling powers at each end. It would seem wise therefore for the Government of India (what ever be the agency for raising the capital) to insist on the condition that it should construct such portion of the scheme which it, or England will be called upon to guarantee. That there must be some guarantee is obvious to any one with the slightest knowledge of the country and railway economics. Whether it will more suitably take the form of—(I) a guarantee^ of ha estimated cost of the Persian section, under which India would build the line to a point midway in estimated outlay between the Russian and Indian line io a puim, m frontiers * or fll) an arrangement under * Provided that in no case would we build to a u T rl’ rorvilrl fnnctrilf't the line UU point short of our limit of influence. which India would construct lue line up to the limits of its sphere of influence, is a question that would seem to depend very largely on the route finally adopted.

At a recent meeting of the Trans-Persian Railway Committee it was agreed that some investigation should be made of the conditions prevailing at the Mekran coast ports during the monsoon, and of the suitability of Gwetter Bay, in particular, or of any other of the ports, for lightering cargo during that season. 2 As Gwetter Bay is not a port of call for coasting steamers, the only means of getting there was in the cable-ship, and a timely break down of the cable between Gwetter and Chabbar, while I was in Simla, afforded the opportunity for Major Hopkins and Mr. Varvill to visit all the ports between Chahhar and Pasni, and furnish the information promised. 3.

[February 5.J CONFIDENTIAL. Section 11. [54973/12] No 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. g- r ^ Foreign Office, February 5. 1913. AS your Excellency is aware, during the visit of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to this country in the autumn of 1912 various memoranda, on the subject of railways in Persia, were exchanged by his Excellency and myself. In one of these papers M. Sazonoff intimated, with regard to the Trans-Persian project, that the Societe d’Etudes wished to obtain from the Persian Government not merely’ as previously, permission to make surveys, but an option for the project in question, and, he urged that His Majesty’s Government should lend their support to the Societe d’Etudes in this negotiation. Your Excellency will recollect that His Majesty s Government had, up to that time, stipulated in their correspondence with the Societe d’Etudes that they should reserve complete freedom of action pending consideration of the report to be submitted to them after the survey had been made; but, in deference to the representations &gt; of M. Sazonoff, I undertook to support the Societe d’Etudes in the proposed negotiation at Tehran subject to all reservations previously made, and, inter alia, on condition that construction should not proceed outside the Russian sphere without the agreement of His Majesty’s Government. , . . , ^ in November last, however, the Societe d Etudes communicated to me the draft of a letter to the Persian Government applying not merely for a mam line, but for extensive branch lines and mantime facilities. These proposals His Majesty’s Government could not fail to regard as more far- reaching and comprehensive than any they had yet contemplated : moreover they were not altogether compatible with certain of the conditions laid before the Russian Government by your Excellency in pursuance of the instructions contained m my despatch No. 129 of the 10th May, 1911. I refer to point 4, where it is requested that fbe Russian. Government should support demands to be made by Great Bntam to the Persian Government for certain bianch lines. r -i I aecordinglv informed the Societe d'Etudes that the application which they proposed to make”to the Persian Government was of a more extensive character than His Maiestv’s Government were in a position to support. In consequence of this decision, the British group of the Societe addressed to His MaiestyVGovernment two further letters (copies of which are already in youi nossession) in the first of these letters, dated the 9th December, the British group Possess/ 0 )• M • t &gt; Government to define their attitude more fully on various nXts and^AmXd their Xctance to send a delegate to Tehran in the absence of fuller information as to that attitude ; in the second letter dated the 20th December they submitted the draft of a fresh application to the Persian Government, in the hone that His Majesty’s Government might approve the modified text. h p This request of the Societe for more comprehensive support placed His Majesty s Government in a somewhat difficult position, for, as the Russian Government are aware another British Syndicate are interested in certain branch lines in Southern awaie, anotner cm y g dioate was in existence before the formation of thiTkociete’ d’Etudes, His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified m ^Mottov*! the^requestf S theTritish grou/of the Societe for definite information • nAPP««itatpd the consideration of many aspects of the question by His Majesty’s Government forthwith, instead of, as hitherto intended, on the submission ° f th ffis r XteBV“ Government have, however, welcomed an opportunity for cordial co oneration with Russia in the development of Persia by the construction of railways tW are persuaded that such co-operation is a natural and very desirable result of the An&lt;d 0 -Ru,sian Convention of 1907, and that it affords the surest guarantee for the re-establishment of order in Persia. They have accordingly been happy to address [•2804 e—ll]the accompanying letter to the Societe d’Etudes, intimating that they are able to give them full support at Tehran in applying at once for a concession from the Russian frontier to the Persian Gulf. Your Excellency will observe that, as regards an extension within the British sphere towards the Indian frontier, His Majesty’s Government have intimated that, in their opinion, the time has not yet come to take up the , question of through ^ connection with India, and they therefore advise the Societe d Etudes, in their own interests, to devote their attention to branch and local lines on their commercial merits. In view of the cautious language which has always been used by the Russian Government and Russian statesmen alike regarding the construction of a through railway to India, His Majesty’s Government believe that the Russian Government will appreciate their point of view, and the sincerity of their conviction that the course indicated is that best calculated to preserve and increase the cordiality of the understanding now happily existing between the two nations ; they accordingly invite the concurrence of the Russian Government in the course suggested in the accompanying letter. As your Excellency reported to me at the time, the Russian Government did not propose to give a definite reply to the points enumerated in my despatch No. 129 of the 10th May 1911 until the Societe d’fitudes had submitted the report on the survey. As, however, the situation has now substantial!} 7 changed owing to the nature of the application to be made to the Persian Government, I have to request your Excellency to recall the communication which you then made to the Russian Government, and to express the hope that they may now be willing to communicate their acceptance of the conditions which His Majesty’s Government proposed, except in so far as point 4 is modified by the terms of the letter to Sir W. Garstin, and by the arrangement agreed to with M. Sazonoff respecting the Mohammerah-Khorremabad line last autumn. You should communicate to M. Sazonoff a copy of the accompanying letter, and you should furnish his Excellency with full explanations in the sense of this despatch. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.India Office, London, 19th April 1912.

Note on certain of the Ports of the Mekran Coast and South-Eastern Persia through which the Trans-Persian Railway may be carried. In view of the facts that:— (lj The Indian Government desire the Trans-Persian Railway to approach India by way of tho AlckvdTi Goast lino , and (2) At whatever 'point the railway first debouches on the sea board, an important Port will probably spring up ; I decided that it would be advisable at once personally to inspect all the points on the Mekran and South-Eastern Persian littoral at which the railway might touch, and record the result of my investigation. Ihave accordingly just visited Pasni, Gwadar, Chatibar, Jask and Lunc ei Abbas bv coasting steamer. I have also discussed local aftairs m these parts with several local authorities, official and unofficial. Bunder Abbas is an open roadstead (steamers lie from two to three miles away from the shore) that oilers no facilities or attractions of any kind for the creation of an efficient harbour or seaport. At present goods are shipped and landed by large native sailing boats which, for an hour or two at high water, are able to get alongside a diminutive an very old stone pier. In bad weather the sea, though not actually rough, is sufficiently disturbed to make shipping and landing very difficult at times, I believe, impossible. (As it is, goods are frequently los between ship and shore). The construction of great breakwaters and piers together with a regular course of dredging, would enable landing and shipping work from ocean-going steamers to be carried on more quickly, but everything would be artificial. ..he spot offers no natural advantages or attractions at the present day. On the contrary the facts that (1) fresh water is now very difficult to obtain, and (d) the climate during the hot months is so bad (a very moist heat with a high temperature and no sea breeze) as to drive anj huiopean and most of the native residents away, render Ihindei Abbas an unsuitable spot at which to bring the drans-Persian Railway to the seaboard. The only point in Bunder Abbas’ favour at the present moment is that it is the nearest seaport to Kirman. At the same time, caravans take 25 to 55 days to travel between Bunder Abbas and Kirman, and goods are exposed to all weathers and to very rough handling. There can be no doubt that if Kirman were served by rail from some other point on the seaboard the caravan trade would quickly disappear, and with it the insignificant collection of dirty mud houses on the bench now called Bunder Abbas. A proposal has been made that the Trans-Persian Railway should debouch on the Persian Gulf at Bunder Abbas and thereafter follow the coast line to Karachi. Such a detour would, whilst depriving promising inland districts of the economic stimulus which the presence of railway always creates, add very materially to the cost and length of the trunk line to India. These disadvantages combined with lack of natural facilities and attractions at Bunder Abbas itself raise the question, Would it not be best to abandon Bunder Abbas altogether, and concentrate attention on some other point on the seaboard ? I am inclined to think it v T ould. And for reasons which will appear a little later. Pasni .—‘‘An evil-smelling hamlet of Ichthyophagi ” ... so Major P. M. Sykes described Pasni in his Ten Thousand Miles in Persia. The description is correct. Lord Curzon in his “ Persia and the Persian Question ” calls Pasni an ... “ excellent harbour.” This is more than Pasni deserves. It is merely an open roadstead protected but very slightly, if at all, by a headland. It happens to be the point at which Alexander the Great is supposed to have struck the coast line. It is also known here a little because one of the land lines of the Indo- European Telegraph Company is watched at this point. The telegraph bungalow is the only substantial building in Pasni. Because the Government of India are anxious to encourage the growth of Pasni, in competition with Gwadur (which is recognised as belonging to the Sultan of Muscat), arrangements have been made for the slow (fort nightly) Gulf mail steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company to stop at Pasni. It is an extremely poor “ harbour,” however, and, being so close to Karachi has no likelihood of being converted into a modern port. Considered from the point of view of the railway, qua railway, the sooner the line strikes inland from the Indian Ocean the better. If, then, the Military Department of the Government of India will accept Pasni to Karachi as being a sufficiently lengthy and vulnerable stretchof coast railway, I would recommend that Pasni be made the first sea- lermimis of the Trans-Persian Railway. The advantages are :— (1.) A shortening of the trunk line as compared with an alignment touching the coast for the first time further westward. (2.) A greater prospect of greater local traffic from Kej-Mekran and the districts to the westward to Kasrkund. (3.) A sea terminus in British territory instead of in the Sultan of Muscat’s or Persian territory. (4.) No necessity to attempt the construction of a modern port or harbour at a point so close to Karachi. The disadvantages of Pasni are : — (a) The great cost of making a harbour if such be considered absolutely essential for political purposes. (b) The unhealthiness—at present—of the locality. (c) Persia would have no seaport served by the railway unless a branch line were constructed. Assuming the military authorities successfully establish the necessity of a longer length of line on rhe sea-coast, then the selection should in my opinion rest upon either Gwadur or Chahbar. Jask need not be considered. It is a tiny village and a telegraph station on a low lying shore from which steamers lie off some two miles. Submarine cables and land lines all unite at Jask. A wireless instal lation is also in use for communication with vessels of the Indian Marine engaged in the suppression of the arms traffic. There is but little trade, and were it not for the importance of the telegraph junction, Jask would never be heard of. I see no reason for the railway to touch Jask under any circumstances. Gwadnr is an open roadstead—ships lie off two miles. The anchor age is fairly well protected by a hammer-head shaped headland. Gwadur, which is moderately healthy, has the largest trade of any port on the Mekran coast. That it does not lend itself to harbour works except at great expense may not be an objection to it as the first sea- terminus of the Trans-Persian Railway. It is under the Sultan of Muscat. This may possibly prove a stumbling block. Chahbar Bai/, so far as I can judge, affords by far the best natural advantages of any port on the Mekran Coast, if the creation of a new port be taken into consideration. If a railway is to be carried across Persia from the north-west to the south-east, Persia will be able to adduce very good grounds why that railway should run to the coast line within Persian territory. There is absolutely no reason why the line, if it is to be a trunk line to India, should touch the coast at any point west of Chahbar Bay, and if the creation of a port be the inevitable consequence of the coming of the railways to the coast, and I think it is, then Chahbar affords the best natural advantages. Chahbar Bay is very large, with deep water all over it, and impres sive mountain 'ranges away to the north-west. The present telegraph buildings and village are on a little patch of rising ground at the south east corner, somewhat protected by a small headland and by a spit o± sand running out in a west-south-westerly direction. Ships lie a miie- and-a-half off the shore. Good freshwater is available, and the place seems quite healthy. . Inside the bay, a little to the north-west of Chahbar vi lage, is a bold headland stretching westward behind which stood the old and famous port of Tiz. I did not get as far as Tiz, but 1 am inclined to think that this is where harbour works, wharves and railway terminus would be located. The whole of the British fleet could easily find anchorage m Chahbar Bay, and although the entrance is some five miles b oad, good shelter can be obtained from all winds and weathers, 1 believe. Summary .—The conclusions I come to are that. (1 ) If the British section of the Trans-Persian Railway could commence to climb to the higher inland tracts from Pasni, andbo carried tlience 111 tlie direction of Tbimpiir, it would be tlio best {a) for the railway, and (6) for Karachi from a purely commercial point of view. (2.) If the Military Department successfully insists upon a longer lead along the coast line, then the railway might well be carried inland from Gwadur. (3.) If the possibility of creating a good harbour and shipping and landing port be a paramount consideration, then Chahbar Bay affords the best natural advantages. Xext m oidei of natural advantages comes Gwadur. (4.) If Persia demands, and is able to obtain, a railway terminus on her own south-eastern coast line, then Chahbar Lay is, in my opinion, the best spot for such a port and terminus, thought of serving Bunder Abbas should be put aside. Indeed, notwithstanding its past history, I would recommend the entire abandonment of Bunder Abbas, so far as the Irans- Persian Railway is concerned. Bam, Kerman, and the regions beyond would 'be well within 24 hours of the sea coast at Chahbar, as compared with 24-35 days by caravan at present. There is nothing whatever in Bunder Abbas to make it worth even a branch line to serve it. (5.) A possible alternative for consideration would be to carry the main line inland from Pasni, and construct (if Persia must have a port in her own territory) a small branch to Tiz in Chahbar on Chahbar Bay.

To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Calcutta, the 21st December 1911. My Loud Marquis, We have had under consideration Your Lordship’s letter No. 24 (Secret), dated the 18th August 1911, in which you ask for our opinion on certain points connected with the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. 2. In reply, we have the honour to enclose a copy of a report by a Committee which has examined the various aspects of the question. The conclusions of the Committee are : (a) that, both on military and commercial grounds, any proposal to bring the railway through Kerman, or via Yezd-Kerman- Charbar, should he resisted; (&amp;) that, although the best alignment, in British and Indian interests, would he that via Yezd-Bandar Abbas, the alignment via Yezd- Eurg-Ramiskh-Charbar presents less objection than the align ment via Yezd-Kerman-Charbar, and may he recommended as a possible basis of compromise ; (c) that a British contribution should he made to the expenses of the Societe d’Etudes as a means of securing representation on an equal footing with the Russian representation on the Societe ; and that {d) the Government of India might safely undertake to give a rebate ” guarantee, limited to the amount of the net ^ profits gained by Indian railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway. 3. We concur generally in these conclusions and recommend that the alignment from Yezd via Furg and Itamiskh to Charbar be put forward as a compromise, to meet the objections raised by the Russian Consortium to the Yezd-Bandar Abbas project. The difference in distance between the alignments is negligible ; the commercial advantages ot the Yezd-Charhai are evident; while the strategical conditions are in both cases veiy same. 4. The objects and methods of the proposed Societe d’Etudes are not altogether clear from the papers before us; and we have no infoiunafon as to the 0 finaneial standing and repute of its members or promoters^ Ihese^are matters on which Your Lordship is in a position o .l' - ’ , . ^ If, however, you are satisfied that there are adequate guarantees ot the good two line the4r £ 2 faith of the syndicate, we think it would be desirable that we should take our share in such a contribution to their expenses as would secure the equal representation on their body of British and Russian interests. Assuming that the Russian Government subscribe £ 30,000 to the funds of the Societe, we should be prepared to find half of an equivalent amount, or £ 15,000; the other half being a charge, under the ordinary rule, on the British Treasury. 5. As regards the question of a Government guarantee of the line, we are not prepared to offer an opinion at present ; but if this should prove to be necessary for the furtherance of the scheme, we should be willing to consider the grant of an indirect guarantee in the shape recommended by the Com mittee. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, bumble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE of PENSHURST. „ O’M. CREAGH. „ GTJY ELEETWOOD WILSON. „ J. L. JENKINS. « i &lt;(Confidential.) Further Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the pro- prosed Trans-Persian Railway. The Secretary of State has sent to the Government of India further papers in regard to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway and has requested their views thereupon, especially on the question whether the objection of the Russian promoters to the route via Bandar Abbas could be met, without detriment to Indian interests, by bringing the line from Yezd via Kerman to the coast at Chahbar. This question has been remitted to the Committee, and it has also been suggested to them that they should consider the feasibility of yet another alignment, namely, from Yezd to Chahbar without passing through Kerman. These two alternative alignments are examined in Sections I and II of this report. In Section III the Committee have considered the desirability of a British contribution to the SociSte d’Etudes (see letter from M. Homiakolf to Sir A. ISicolson of 17th July 1911—Annex 3 to Secretary of State’s despatch, Secret No. 24 of 18th August J 911) and of a financial guarantee, when the railway is working, on the lines of the rebates granted on Indian railways (see letter from Messrs. Baring Brothers to Sir A. Nicolson of 13th July 19il— Annex 1 to the same despatch). J.—Alignment from Yezd via Kerman to Chahbar. 2. The strategical disadvantages to India of a railway cutting across Persia from the north-west to join the Indian railway system either at Nushki of Karachi have already been so fully indicated (see enclosures 4 and 6 of Government of India Secret-External despatch No. 18, dated 2otd lebiuary 1911) that it seems only necessary now to recapitulate such arguments^ as may assist in answering the question now put to the Government of India by the Secretary of State in the paper under consideration, viz., whether it would he possible, without detriment to Indian interests, to meet the wishes of the Russian Consortium so far as to agree to an alignment Yezd Kerman- Chahbar and thence by the coast to Karachi, instead of the Bandar Abbas- Yezd route. 3. The final section of the alignment now suggested {viz., from Chahbar to Karachi) will run near the sea and so is vulnerable to England’s sea power though of course not to the same extent as a line from Bandar Abbas to Karachi. We do not think that the difference m the extent of the line on the sea-face would by itself justify rejection of the Russian proposal. But we have also to consider whether an enemy, who has once acquired a thiough me from the Caucasus, or from the head of the Gulf, to Kerman and Bam, would not be in 'a position to continue his advance inland through a iich country such as Seistan, instead of having to proceed by the exposed and barren rou e along the coast. 4. In our previous report we did not think it necessary to discuss the strategical advantages and disadvantages of this route, as on commeicial Karachi tat “ •w-swsr* ss szxnszx ck&amp;H considerable ^bee^tgul^sed by arms caravans going to otSmtu^ ro m W th y e ea Mekr:n b crst. Ve advi therefore that once a hostile army has established itself at Kerman a con S ^^ without mih difficulty deve oped a f ainst ^ - ^^^tld m^ntain together with the Home Expeditionary lorce.5. The General Staff argue that having gained a position in Seistan* Bussia would be able (presuming this railway from the Caucasus to Kerman was built) “ to throw a force upon the Afghan frontier, on the Kandahar flank, from the double direction of the Caucasus and the combined position in Trans- Caspia and Turkistan ” (see Committee of Imperial Defence paper No. 52 D., Q remarks by Lord Curzon), that is to say, that the Helmand position would be turned and we should be forced to accept decisive battle at the gates of India itself near Quetta, and probably with inferior numbers. In connection with this part of the subject, we have also appended to our report some further notes by Lord Curzon, which have been received with a batch of Committee of Imperial Defence papers since our former report was framed, and also a note by Mr. Balfour on the danger of Seistan being connected with the Bussian Empire. Lord Curzon’s notes deal with Captain Bittich’s Report on Russian Railways in Persia. The project which Captain Rittich advocated was practically the same as that now advocated by the Russian Syndicate, but was of course for a purely Russian railway. 6. We recognise that the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 has for the time being, and, perhaps, for many years to come, placed a different com plexion on the situation. But while agreements may lapse or be broken, railways are comparatively speaking permanent, and in considering the align ment of a railway destined to link up the frontiers of Russia and India, we have to take all contingencies into account. We agree, therefore, with the view laid before us by the General Staff that the strategical reasons against allowing a through railway to be constructed from the Caucasus, or the head of the Gulf, direct to Kerman are so weighty that the Government of India should oppose such an alignment by all the means at its disposal. 7. Another point requires notice. The Russian Syndicate, like ourselves, foresee a time when the Baghdad Railway will be extended into Southern Persia, and compete with through traffic with Europe. Eor this reason they say that they wish to avoid Bandar Abbas. But the junction of the tw'o lines is, it seems to us, only a matter of time and the selection of a line further east ward would only postpone the competition which they fear, for a term of years, which is insignificant compared to the vast future which lies before this railway. We do not, therefore, consider that any weight need be attached to this contention. 8. We have so far demonstrated that for very strong political and military reasons it is most essential that the main route should not pass through Kerman, and we are also in a position to show that commercially the Bandar Abbas route is the better alignment. 9.. In Mr. Homiakoff’s letter to Sir A. Nicholson, dated the 17th July 1911, it is stated “that it is Rn indispensable condition for the commercial success of the railway that the line through Persia should be as short and straight as possible in order to enable it to compete both with other existing means of transit and possible future lines ”. This expression of opinion is true only when the country traversed by the shorter route is of a similar character to that traversed by a longer route. When the character of the country passed through on the alternative routes differs most materially, the shorter route traversing a rough mountainous tract and the longer route running through relatively country, the cost of haulage by the shorter but steeper-graded route will be larger than the cost of haulage by the longer route. The latter t eiefore commei cially becomes the better one to adopt, since haulage charges govern the rates for the carriage by rail of goods and produce. 10. The suggestion made by Mr. Homiakoff is that, if Nushki be found unsuita e as a point ot junction and if Karachi be recommended instead, it would suit Russian views if the alignment ran from Kerman direct to Karachi. Ihe Secretary of State suggests as a modification to this proposal that the alignment might run from Kerman to the coast at Chahbar and thence along the sea-face to Karachi. Both these alignments are open to the commercial objection that the extra cost of working them would far outweigh the saving in mileage length, and we are advised that goods could be carried from Yezd Via Bandar Abbas to Karachi at cheaper rates, owing to the flat gradients,than it would he necessary to charge if the via Kerman route were adopted. 11. We append to this report a section of the line from Chahbar to Kerman via Bampur and Bam, and it may be taken that the direct route from Kerman to Karachi would be a still more difficult section to work from the railway point of view. It will be seen that the line would have to rise over two passes, one 7,300 feet high and the other 8,300 feet high. To surmount these heights the grades would have to be very steep, necessitating light loads and the provision of very heavy locomotives, both for direct haulage and banking purposes. The speeds would be slow and the cost of working very high. As illustrating this last point, it will be useful to point out that on hill lines in India the Government of India have admitted the high cost of working such grades as would be met on the Kerman-Chahbar route by allowing hill railways to charge very much higher maxima than is the ordinary fixed standard for railways generally in India :— The Kalka-Simla Bailway is allowed to charge 4 times the ordinary maxima. The Ootacamund Bailway is allowed to charge 8 times the ordinary maxima, The Darjeeling-Himalayan Bailway is allowed to charge 5 times the ordinary maxima. The distance from Yezd to Karachi via Kerman is 1,147 miles, and from the same place via Bandar Abbas to Karachi 1,341 miles, a difference of 194 miles. The advantage derived from this difference would more than disappear with the higher rates which would have to be levied by the vid Kerman route. 12. We have, therefore, no hesitation in advising that the vid Bandar Abbas route is by far the better route to adopt from the point of view of cheaper working cost, which would permit of lower rates being charged for public traffic than it would be necessary to exact if the vid Kerman route were selected. jy. Alignment from Yezd to Chahbar without passing through Kerman. 13. So far as we are able to ascertain from the Boute Books, the best and most economical alignment both from the point of view of ^ construct ion and working to follow on this route, would be via Burg and Bamishk to Chahbar. The most difficult section of this alignment, namely, from Yezd to Eurg, would be common to this route and the one via Bandar Abbas, and we are ot opinion, consequentlv, that the cost of working the railway by either of these routes would be approximately the same, especially as the route to Chahbar wa h urg and Bamishk will be a little shorter (about 40 miles) than that by Bandar Abbas. As compared with the Yezd-Kerman-Chahbar route, the route via Eurg and Bamishk to Chahbar would have considerable advantages ; ample length would be available for the line to ascend to the heights to be crossed, thus providing easy grading, whereas on the Kerman-Chahbar route the heights rise abruptly and having to be surmounted in short distances, involve very severe gradients. 14. We consider, therefore, that from a commercial point of view this alignment is immensely superior to that via Kerman, and that there is not very much to choose between it and the alignment via Bandar Abbas. Erom a military point of view the alignment has the great advantage ot not passing through Kerman. It is not so favourable to British interests as the alignment via Bandar Abbas, in that the portion running along the sea coast is very much shorter, but, as we have already stated in paragraph 3 above, we do not consider that this drawback should by itself be considered fatal. We are of opinion, therefore that while the Bandar Abbas route would be the best from the point Of view of British and Indian interests, the route woEurg and Bamishk to Chahbar is to a large extent free from the objections which we have had to urge against the other alternative routes, and migh he recommended to His Majesty’s Government as a possible basis for arriving at a compromise.4i XU. The Societe d'Etudes arid the Proposed Guarantee. 15. We now propose to examine ttie two questions of (a) A contribution to the “ Societe d’Etudes ”, the syndicate which is to he formed— (1) To further preliminary investigation. (2) To negotiate with the Persian Government to obtain the necessary concessions. (3) Finally to form the Company for the construction of the railway. (5) A guarantee by the British Government to the Company to be * formed to build and work the railway. 16. On the first question, considered solely from the business point of view, we are in entire accord with the opinions expressed by Mr. Huth Jackson in his letter of the 18th July 1911; hut we recognise that the question requires consideration also from the point of view of general policy, 17. It is stated in Mr. Homiakoff’s letter of the 17th July 1911, to Sir A. Nicholson, that the leading Ilussian Banks have subscribed a capital of SOtbOOO roubles, say £30,000, towards the establishment of a Societe d’Etudes for the objects quoted above. It seems likely, though we have no definite information on the point, that the Russian Government are in reality behind this subscription, and the question arises whether it would not be desirable that His Majesty’s Government should also, directly or indirectly, contribute to the expenses of the “ Societe d’Etudes ” with a view to obtaining a measure 6f'control over their operations, and thus making more secure .our position in respect of the Company which is eventually to be formed. We consider that it is of the greatest importance that the United Kingdom should not be left out of the preliminary negotiations to be undertaken by the Societe d’Etudes, especially in view of the possibility that German financiers might be more than willing to step in. We would, therefore, advise that £30,000 be found by India and England as the British contribution to the Societe d’Etudes, on the condition that British and Russian representation in the Societe be equal. 18. The exact form in which this contribution should be made will have to be decided in London. If objection is taken to Government subscribing direct, especially as the Russian Government have not professedly done so, we would suggest that it might be possible to arrange terms on which some lead ing bank or group of financiers in England would be willing to make the contribution, Government retaining sufficient powers in regard to the selection and subsequent action of the British representatives on the Societe. 19. With regard to (6), the question of a guarantee to the Company to be formed to build and work the line, it is stated that the Russian Government are prepared to consider the question of an indirect guarantee to the scheme in contemplation by reserving a certain proportion of their railway revenue surplus for this purpose, in consideration of the increased traffic on lines in Russian territory, which would necessarily accrue from the opening of a trans-Persian railway to India—see Annex 1 to Secretary of State’s despatch No. 24 of 18th August 1911. 20. The wording of this proposal is not very clear, but it would appear to indicate a financial arrangement similar to the “ rebate ” system on Indian railways. On those railways, “ rebate ” is very often given to assist in the formation of a company to construct a line. The Southern Punjab Railway is a leading case in point. This line, with the extensions recently sanctioned, is about 600 miles long and the capital has been raised under a “ rebate ” given by the North-Western State Railway. The amount so paid by the North-Western Railway is limited to the net profits earned by the North- Western Railway on the traffic interchanged, and the rebate is only payable up to an amount sufficient for the Southern Punjab Railway to earn a fixed percentage on its capital, the rebate being the difference between what the line actually earn® in dividend and the amount of the fixed dividend decided on.21. A “ rebate ” guarantee on the terms applied to Indian railways is therefore no new proposition to India, and we think that the Government of India might commit itself to the extent of agreeing to give a “ rebate on the same terms as are applied to Indian railways. We are inclined to doubt whether the investing public will understand and be induced to invest their capital on a rebate guarantee, as it has taken a long time to educate English investors in Indian railways to this form of guarantee. Nevertheless the recommendation seems to us one which might safely be adopted. We do not think that it places any great liability on the Government of India, or any liability which the Government of India could not fairly accept, as the rebate to which we would agree would be limited to the net profits gained by Indian railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway; and at the same time the recommendation has the advantage of being in accord with the proposal (if we have understood it correctly) put forward on the Russian side. 1V. — Conclusions, Briefly summarised, our conclusions are as follows (i) We consider that both on military and commercial grounds the Government of India should resist any proposal to bring the railway through Kerman, and consequently should not agree to an alignment via Yezd-Kerman-Chahbar. (ii) The same objections do not appear to us to exist in regard to the alignment via Yezd-Eurg-Ramiskh-Chahbar, and while we hold to our previous opinion that the best alignment in British and Indian interests would be via Yezd-Bandar Abbas, we think for the reasons stated in our report that this route might be recom mended to His Majesty’s Government as a possible basis of compromise. (iii) We are in favour of a British contribution to the expenses of the V Societe d’Etudes as a means of securing representation equal to the Russian representation on the Societe. (iv) We think that the Government of India might undertake, in the event of the line being constructed, to give a “ rebate ” guarantee, limited to the amount of the net profits gained by Indian Railways from interchange of traffic with the Trans-Persian Railway.

(% (1) Notes by Lord Curzon {dated 26th February 1904) on Captain Ttittich’s Report on Russian Railways in Rersia. &lt;{ Now appears upon the scene Captain Rittich and his men ; and they produce a scheme which seems to me to be based upon profound political and strategical insight, and, if realised, to secure for Russia all that she desires with the maximum of advantage to herself and the maximum of detriment to us. “Let me point out the nature of the advantages to Russia, under the two heads, political and strategical— “ I.—Political. “ (i) Cutting across Persia diagonally from north-west to south-east the projected line would place in Russian hands the whole of the principal cities of Persia from Tabriz to Kerman, including Kazvin, Hamadan (by a branch line Kazvin-Hamadan), Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Ispahan (by a branch line Kashan- Ispahan) and Yezd. The whole of the central Persian plateau would thus fall under Russian control, and from this line she could push her influence south wards—to such places as Sultanabad, Shiraz and elsewhere as she pleased. ((Such a line would not merely firmly establish Russian influence throughout the whole of Central Persia, but it would also effectually destroy British influence in the south, for it would skirt, along its northern flank, the whole of sphere that we have hitherto been disposed to claim. « (iii) The line would be a relatively cheap and easy one to construct, for it would proceed through a generally level country, with a few mountain passes; and it would also be cheap and easy to guard, for the tribes along it are of a peaceful character and would give no trouble. “ II.— Strategical. “ The strategical advantages of the line are even more striking. (il It possesses the supreme merit of enabling the Russians to direct aeainst Southern Persia, or against the Indian frontier on the Seistan-Mekran section the whole of the troops of the Caucasus, escaping both the Caspian crossing, the precarious transit along the single line of the Trans-Caspian Railway, and the long march southwards from the direction of Meshed. « (if) it possesses the scarcely inferior merit, from the Russian standpoint, £ •a* m iLp Pnlf altogether, with a British fleet patrolling it, with Bntish forces'very Ukelyt oration of its principal ports and with British warships forces very i y F ^ { ri£?llt 0 ut into the open ocean, and plants her?^the™a^at'bhahha^a oonverted^to^navaTbare'of ^^ti^ the western borders of British protected territory. ^ ^ ^ were constmcted from Bam to Seistau would the railway enabU Bu^a t-einforce h^ positm^ m douWe^irectionof the Caucasus and the’ combined position in Trans-Caspia ^ “the line would be until it reached the neighboui oo mountains on the south.

This conclusion appears to have been accepted by all the authorities in England. ,, (2) Note by Mr. Balfour {April 1904—Committee of Imperial Defence paper No. 46). «'We must discourage the connection of Seistan by railway with any portion of the Russian Empire. * * I am clear that, in addition to the occupation of Chahbar, we should employ every means at our disposal for preventing the project of a Caucasus-Chahbar or a Caucasus-Seistan railway being seriously proposedFOET WILLIAM.

We concur generally in these conclusions, except in regard to a few noints as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. The first point relates to the proposed internationalisation Oi the branch lines. We agree that it will be desirable to internationalise anv branch lines that may be constructed in the neutral zone. But ue see no necessity for treating as international any branch lines which Russia or Great Britain 7 may decide to construct in their respective zones We would propose, therefore, to treat the proposed branch line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project and to keep this question out of the negotiations with Russia, except in so far as her support may be necessary to enable us to secure a concession from the Persian Government. 4. Secondly, we do not endorse the proposal for a branch line from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan. Such a line would be a most difficult and most costly undertaking, and would at the same time be quite unnecessary either as a commercial project or as a bar to German enterprise, since the construction of a line from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz and Mohammerah would cause all the trade to pass through Bandar Abbas and Mohammerah and Bushire would entirely lose its importance as a port. Bandar Abbas could, we believe, be converted into a good port, while Bushire can never be a good port, since all the big ships have to lie out at a distance of five or six miles from the shore. Consequently, Bushire must in the end disappear as a trade centre and a railway to Shiraz would be useless. Whether Shiraz should he connected with Ispahan or not is another matter. If the Trans-Persian line passes through Ispahan, as proposed by the Consortium, a branch to Shiraz would be advantageous from the Russian point of view, since it would provide railway communication with Shiraz which Russian trade would not otherwise have. In that case, we think that it would he desirable to make no mention of a branch from Shiraz to Ispahan at present. If, on the other hand, the Trans-Persian line is to avoid Ispahan, as proposed by the Russian Government, it would be greatly to our advantage to have a connection with Ispahan, since our trade would be able to pour in from Bandar Abbas via Shiraz. We think, therefore, that it would be better to take no action in regard to this branch line until it is known more certainly whether the Trans-Persian line is to pass through Ispahan or not. 5. Thirdly, we disagree with the Committee as to the necessity for pro ceeding with the construction of the Mohammerah-Hamadan line simul taneously with the construction of the main line. Such a branch would he useless for practical purposes, since it would have to compete with the Baghdad-Khanikin line and the Trans-Persian Railway. A line from Julfa to Mohammerah would have been useful as a counterpoise to the Baghdad Railway in the absence of the more comprehensive scheme now proposed, but it has quite lost its value now that the Trans-Persian Railway is to be the counterpoise. We think, therefore, that the Mohammerah-Hamadan concession should be obtained merely for the purpose of ear-marking, as against any attempt to connect the Baghdad Railway extension with the Gulf by this route. 6. Finally, we are not persuaded, on the information contained in the Committee’s report, that the practical difficulties of the alignment proposed by Colonel Cox (namely, from Yezd to Karachi via Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Sarbaz and Kej) are so serious as to make it necessary to adopt the more circuitous route via Bandar Abbas, and we have some doubt whether the latter route would prove acceptable to the Russian Government. We would preferI s therefore to reserve our opinion as to the respective merits of the Ye*d- Bandar Abbas-Karachi and Yezd-Kerman-Karachi alignments until these two routes have been examined locally by a railway engineer. ^ 7 With these reservations, we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government and have only to add that in our opinion, it is very desirable, if the Trans-Persian Railway is to be made at all that it should be commenced as soon as possible, so that it may be completed some time before the Baghdad Railway. The line will then have acquired a certain amount of trade and traffic that would naturally fall to the line that is first completed. 8 We have made no suggestions as to the financing of the proposed line, as this is a matter which His Majesty's Government will probably wish to reserve for discussion in England. But we endorse the recommendation of the Committee that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain in connection with the project should be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Proposed linking up of Russian and Indian railway systems by a line through Persia. As I understand the position, we must now assume complete good faith on the part of Russia under the Convention and abandonment of former designs on India. We cannot, therefore, take our stand on fundamental objec tions of Indian strategists against connection of Indian and Russian railway systems. If above premise is conceded, it seems to me that an attitude of mere benevolent neutrality will hardly suffice and might be dangerous, and that, having exercised right, which the promoters concede to us, of constructing the line from Kerman southwards, we should support the present proposal to the extent of co-operating in the thorough examination of project from business and engineering points of view. But although the bogey of Russian designs on India is laid for the present generation, we cannot advisedly ignore the strategical aspect of the connection via Seistan altogether, and in this connection I cannot understand the dictum in letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 23rd December 1909, to the effect that the strategical objections are equally insuperable, whether the line proceeds from Kerman via Nushki or across Mekran and thence near the coast to Hyderabad. I submit that an alignment from Kerman via Bam, Rigan, Bampur, Serbaz, thence across the frontier near Kej, and so on to Karachi or Hyderabad would be infinitely less open to strategical objection and would also be a much more profitable line of country to tap. If the line actually touched the coast, it would do so in British territory at Gwetter or Pasni, or at Gwadur by arrangement with Maskat. Furthermore, this alignment would provide effective means for checking the arms traffic through Mekran, and for exercising influence with the Baluchistan Chiefs connected therewith. Assuming that we agree to co-operate, there remains the question of keep- ino- Germany out of the neutral zone, and preventing her from profiting by a junction of the Baghdad Railway with the Anglo-Russian through route. Granted the good faith of Russia as regards designs on India, there is nothing to prevent a pro-German epidemic in Petersburgh from encouraging Germany to undertake active enterprise in the neutral zone and thus weaken our present predominant position therein. This contingency seems conceivably possible at the present time. The above considerations seem to me to make ft essential that we should stipulate with Russia that as an anterior condition of our co-operation in promoting the through route, she must first join us in obtaining a concession for the Mohammerah-Julfa line and agree to commence the sectfon from Mohammerah to Hamadan immediately she agrees to connect the Khanikin branch of the Baghdad Railway with the Russian system via Kermanshah We should also stipulate that we simultaneously obtain a concession for a branch line in the neutral zone, firstly, from Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Kerman; secondly, from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz; and, thirdly, from Bandar Abbas to join the through line at Bam The latter connection should be built simultaneously with the mam Une 'while the two former would merely be held for blocking purposes, and be taken in hand when occasion demanded. With above safeg .ards and provided that commercial facilities for all be assured throughout the whole railway, I believe that both Indian and English trade would benefit and find new openings equally with Russian and it cannot but be supposed that the general effect of the railway would be to improve the administration develop the country and increase the capacity of the Persian market The question of passenger traffic depends on amount to which cost and length of journey could I? i •] _ j T-mf if rnav be presumed that at equal ratio there would be lai ge o nat e 1 InX y n trX with Europe. Without f urther study I do not feeTabTe to offer useful views as regards question of division of management and control. Foreign Office Frew—No. 494—23-12-10—39.(Confidential.) No. 10 C., dated Calcutta, the 20th December 1910 (Secret). From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 2604 E.-A. of 3rd December 1910, in which I am desired to furnish my views on the proposed scheme for the connection of the European and Indian Railway systems by the construction of a line across Persia. # 2. The lack of complete information regarding the country through which the proposed line is to run ; the absence of reliable data and statistics of its potential possibilities, or even its existing trade requirements, render it impossible to deal with the present problem on the usual lines. Any detailed forecast of the financial results of the line or its general effect on Persia and adjoining countries is at present impossible. All that can be done in these circum stances is to treat the subject on broad lines and endeavour to arrive at general conclusions. 3. Impartial consideration of the subject is moreover hampered at the outset by the fact that we, as a nation, have always been accustomed to “ insularity ”, and have so long endeavoured to maintain the insularity of our Indian Empire, by an impassable barrier of buffer States, and that we cannot be expected to accord a welcome to any scheme which threatens to invade our isolation and bring us, as the proposed railway must do, into direct contact by rail with the outer world. So strong is the natural tendency to oppose any change from existing conditions, that there is every danger of our failing to recognise in a proposal such as the present one, advantages which would he self-apparent to other European nations or even our own Canadian Dominion, to whom intercommu nication by railway with adjoining countries is an accepted condition of ordinary life. In our effort to consider the problem without undue bias we must, however, endeavour, when steering wide of the Scylla of unreasonable opposition, not to shipwreck on the Charybdis of blind acceptance. 4. However anxious we may rightly he not to expedite a new order of things, we must admit the futility of expecting that the present want of com munications with, and in Persia, can much longer prevent access to the world s trade, or form a barrier to European nations in their rivalry for new and larger markets. No less necessary is it to recognise the risk that, if we decline the opportunity now afforded, of a joint arrangement with Russia, to open up Persia by railway to the advantange of our mutual trade, Russia may be compelled, by the necessities of the new situation created by the coming Baghdad Railway, to make joint railway arrangements with some other Power in which our a van tages and requirements would be ignored. We should doubtless in the end ecompelled to face the very evils we now wish to avoid, and connect our Indian Say system with one which might not receive us in an amicable spirit or on favourable terms. It is obviously essential to recognise the above contingency, before proceed- in* to consider the present proposal, because arguments of a political, com mercial and military nature, which may now be urged against its adoption, may be no less cogent at the moment when necessity hereafter compels us to stultify ourselves by ignoring them. 6 It is proposed to connect the Russian and Indian Railway systems by a line from Baku through Persia to India. The line will probably leave the coast of the Caspian near Enzeli, some 250 miles east of Baku, and pass through or near Tehran, Ispahan, Tezd, and Kerman. Prom Baku to the Indian border of Persia, the line will be about 1,100 miles m length. 6 Prom the commercial point of view it is obvious that the line will benefit Russian trade to an enormous and preponderating extent. As stated by the authors “ all the freights of the Volga will get a considerable advantage over foreign goods over a great part of Persia.” The force of this statement is the more self-evident, if one remembers that goods from the Caspian littoral and the Volo'a need not take to the railway at Baku, but can be water borne as far -pwJfi. thus further diminishing the rail journey by over 200 miles. It will be difficult for British goods to compete in these circumstances with similar Russian goods in any part of interior Persia. To give British trade any fair chance of competing at all, it will be necessary to construct branch lines northwards to meet the central line from the coast. That from Bandar Abbas to Kirman appears the one to be built first, as being within our own sphere and therefore to be under our sole control. Others from Ahwaz to Ispahan and Bushire through Shiraz will doubtless follow in due course. 7. It is not only in Persia itself, however, that the line will benefit Russian trade, for it will open out to it many fields of commercial enterprise in India. The following table of comparative distances of a few places selected at random will suffice to illustrate this: Baku to Quetta ... ••• • •• 1,500 miles. Baku to the Indo-Persian frontier • •• 1,100 &gt;» Enzeli to Q,uetta ... ... • •• 1,300 5} Enzeli to the Indo-Persian frontier 800 II Calcutta to Q,uetta ••• ... • •• 1,700 II Calcutta to Peshawar 1,500 II Bombay to Peshawar (by rail) ... 1,500 II Bombay to Quetta (by rail) • • • 1,300 II Bombay to Delhi ... • mm 1,000 !» Karachi to Peshawar ... *&gt;« %•• 1,000 II Quetta to Lahore ... • mm 800 11 Quetta to Kirman ... • mm 800 11 Quetta to Delhi ... ... • mm 900 11 Quetta to Yezd ... • mm 900 11 Quetta to Karachi • mm 600 11 8. The same table, however, serves to illustrate the advantage which will accrue to Indian trade from the proposed line, and it may be confidently expected that a very great impulse will be given thereby to Indian trade throughout Persia. The distance by rail from Delhi to Yezd, it will be observed, is but little more than from Bombay or Calcutta to Peshawar or Quetta. 9. 'We have as yet only considered the Persian railway from the aspect as a trade carrier, and it is now necessary to consider it in its more importantaspect of a trade producer. In an isolated and undeveloped country, such as Persia the introduction of a railway line cannot fail to have most important and far-reaching effects on trade. It must inevitably, as has been the case in everv country in the world, lead to the development of agriculture and other natural resources, and nowhere perhaps do greater possibilities or room for such development exist than in Persia. There are vast tracts of good land everywhere lying unused and only needing the small capital necessary for reopening the old Karezes by which they used to be irrigated. Nearer India, it will pass close to the existing fertile tract of Seistan whose wealth of surplus products will at last find a market. This must automatically lead to th? rap id development of that rich country and further swell the volume of local trade. . .. i v Next will follow in the natural course of events the exploration and develop ment of the mineral resources of the country, which are known to exist bat Xh through want of transport facilities, have hitherto not been considered worth investigating. ^ Last hut not least, the existing local products of Persia, such as ghee, hides _ . i p -tTriiinVi pUlier absence or cost of transport have made it and gram, X&gt;*H^Xto export will become available for export and thus Cment i.e., the dearth of exports for the payment of imports.

A&lt; H . MoMaho*.To facilitate action when the time comes, it would appear advisable to start railway surveys from Nushki, Robat and Bandar Abbas with the least possible delay. 11. Of the financial success of the line itself I do not think that there is any reason to be sceptical. Whatever the discomfort of the long rail journey compared to that by sea to Europe from the East may be, it is but reasonable to expect that the majority of travellers will be tempted to use the former route, either from motives of economy or from desire to traverse the countries through which the line will run. This will apply not only to travellers to and from India but to those between Australia and China. The number of through passengers on which the estimate of income is based may appear large at first sight, but I do not think that it is unduly so. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that the receipts from local passengers have been under rather than over estimated. The amount of local traffic which a railway creates even in the most unpromising areas is often surprising. As an instance of this I may quote the line from Quetta to Nushki. When the construction of the line was under consideration the prospect of a remuner ative local traffic was hardly thought worthy of being taken into account owing to the seemingly uninhabited area it traversed. Nevertheless, the amount of local traffic has been such as to convert what was feared would be an unremunerative strategic line into a commercially profitable one. Similarly, there is considerable reason to suppose that the line onward will, in Persia, develop a local traffic of a more extensive and lucrative nature than that now estimated for. Incidentally the through traffic on the proposed line will tend to increase the receipts of the Indian systems to a very considerable extent, by attracting many passengers through India who would otherwise travel by sea without setting foot in this country. It is necessary to give due credit to this factor, and also to the additional income from the carriage of the increased bulk of Indo-Persian goods on Indian lines, when considering the question of guarantees to the new undertaking. ±z. it is necessary next to regard the proposal from the political and mili tary point of view. This can best be done together, as the difficulty of separat ing political from military considerations is very considerable, and for this reason only do I venture to trespass on military ground. ,, 7^ e are now ^ rou gl lt face to face with new problems, and strong though a • ^clmation may be to avoid their consideration by opposing the proposal initio, it is necessary to tackle them seriously and impartially. In the first place, the proposed railway line through Persia involves the ° f ^ surin ^ lts safet J throughout its length. It is unreasonable to xpect a lucrative passenger or goods traffic, if the line has to run, in turn, the gauntlet of Bakhtian brigands or disappointed and exasperated Afghan gun runners. It will have to be safeguarded from both. * ^ ^ ne itself facilitate measures for dealing with involves k thlS nature ’ b + ut the real difficulty which the protection of the line Eon and + coinmo n to several other questions connected with its construc- In tM^c^se th^ 06 ’ *1'’ ltsrelatl . on t0 the futur e of the Persian Government. of a railwav hnt r P ro ^ ectl0 ? of th e line affects the future not only ota railway but of a nation.

Given ex ^ ence proposed line have on our position m India t Given assurance of perpetual continuance of amicable relations5 with Russia, the question hardly needs reply. We must, however, consider also the possible future contingency of hostility with Russia. A railway line lead ing from an enemy’s country, distant though that may be, undoubtedly intro duces sources of danger to which we are unaccustomed. As indicated *in the previous remarks, the extent of the danger largely depends on the previous effect of the line on the autonomy of Persia. The proposed line moreover introduces a new factor into the problem; for Germany will have doubtless acquired access to this same line from Baghdad. It is possible to conceive conditions under which the new element might add an additional source of danger to ourselves from the new line, but it is, I think, more reasonable to suppose that it will greatly minimise future danger, because the antagonism of German and Turkish interests with those of Russia is likely both to avert hostility between Russia and ourselves, and, in the event of hostilities, to render the Persian line of less assistance and value to Russia than it might otherwise be. In the event of a combination of Russia, Germany, and Turkey against us, it would be hard to overestimate the menace which the Persian line presents to us, but at this stage it would seem superfluous to com plicate the problems of the proposed line with those of Armageddon, and it should suffice to continue to deal with this question on more familiar lines. 14. It may be assumed that we w 7 ill have constructed at least one branch line from the Persian coast to meet the central line and this fact, in conjunc tion with the long length of the line from Baku or Enzeli, will deprive it of many attractions to Russia for military purposes against India. Again, and this is a still more important factor, the same line nearer India will have converted an important strategic point from being a grave source of danger into a place of great advantage to ourselves. I refer to Seistan. As long as Seistan is left as it is now, equi-distant from the nearest Russian and British garrisons, it must ever remain an attractive objective and a source of temptation to Russia, and a danger to ourselves. The con struction of the proposed railway line will bring us within such easy reach of it as to destroy all Russian hopes of its easy acquisition. Being no longer in the line of least resistance, it will lose its attractions to Russia and its danger to ourselves. On the other hand, Seistan, with its important strategic position with regard to Persia and the JELelmand, would be at our disposal, and its great local resources would enable us to place there, when necessity arises, a force sufficiently large to' render access to India by rail both difficult and dangerous. Prom a military-political point of view therefore, the proposed railway line does not seem an unmixed evil or one which should be avoided on military grounds at the expense of other important considerations. 15. Afghanistan has so far been omitted from these remarks, but a word is necessary on tne Afghan aspect of the question. The line will affect Afghanistan only from the military aspect and in proportion to the menace it represents to that country from Russia. H e cannot expect Afghanistan to be pleased with railway or any other arrangements we may jointly make with Russia, as suspicion of Russia must tend to give them a significance hostile to Afghanistan. Apart from this, there is but little in the proposed project which will alarm the Afghan Government. The desirability of oar improving communications in order to co-operate in the defence of^ vV estein Afghanistan has already been clearly recognised by them, the position of the proposed line with regard to Seistan and thereby to the Herat-Kandahar route will, 1 consider, outweigh in the official Afghan mind any additional menace from Russia through Southern Persia. 16. Of the numerous minor difficulties which the present proposal will brin 0, to the front, the one which will probabiy give most trouble is that of eua°’e Assuming that neither Russia nor ourselves will allow tiie other to use their- standard guage, it follows that some neutral guage will have to be decided upon. This involves a break of guage at both ends of the Persian line, and incidentally increases the difficulty of finding a suitable place for the entry of the line into British territory. The requirements of a large Railway terminus, establishment, staff, &amp;c., in supplies and water are not easily met on the Indo-Persian border,and it will probably be found necessary to take the line, even at the cost of distance and time, either to the edge of the Seistan area, or to run a short branch line northwards to that place, to supply the 3 unction where our Kailway systems will meet. 17 In the above remarks I have endeavoured to state as impartially as possible the merits and disadvantages of the proposed railway. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the connection of the European and Indian Kailway systems is inevitable ; that the disadvantages and dangers are not of such a nature as to justify our declining to take this opportunity of entering into the scheme by mutual agreement on amicable and thereby favourable terms, and that therefore we should give the proposal a favourable reception. The time at my disposal has been so short that I am conscious that the above remarks must be considered as a somewhat crude and inadequate treat ment of so important and complex a question. 18. The following is a brief summary of the arguments advanced in this letter and the main conclusions arrived at: It is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer con tinue, or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercom munication by rail from the West. The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and if w^e decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable condi tions. The proposed railway must benefit Russian trade in much larger propor tion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up of Persia. It will increase the receipts of Indian Railways and thereby benefit Indian revenues. The military or political disadvantages of inter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventing the line destroying the autonomy of Persia. On the above grounds the proposal merits favourable reception, but in order to minimize the preliminary advantages of Russia, to assist British trade, prevent Russia getting an undue start of both British and Indian trade, and for strategic purposes it is absolutely essential;— (1) To construct a line under British control, from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf port to the central line. (2) That the Indian Railway system be extended to the Indo-Persian border by the easiest and quickest route, i.e., from Nushki. (3) That work on (1) and also from the Indo-Persian border westwards should commence simultaneously with that at the Russian end. (4) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed without necessarily waiting for the commencement of the Persian line. (5) That a line be constructed in due course from Karachi to meet the central line within British limits. (6) That no time he lost in commencing the necessary railway surveys for all the above lines. Foreign Office Press—No. 448 —24-1-11—74.Enclosure No. 3. (Memorandum by the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence.) The case is sent io me for such concrete facts as might enable the Govern ment of India to estimate the probable effect on Indian trade of such a railway as is contemplated. The question put to me is not, as I take it, whether such a railway would help trade (of course it would) or be worth making on other grounds, but whether it would help trade in some sort of proportion to the expenditure. I have therefore thought it incumbent on me to go through all the available information with such speed as has been possible. I may say at once that I have failed to constitute any statistical data that would warrant any such estimate. At the best, any estimate relating to the future is of the nature of conjecture. If I were to set the data out here I should merely waste time and incur some risk of giving rise to conclusions, discussions or hypo theses that are wide of the mark. For if one presents a mass of figures, that do not really illustrate the particular point to be considered, there is a danger that—qualify them as one may —some of them will stick. Briefly^ then, our information regarding the volume of trade conducted by India in the direction of Seistau and northwards under present conditions affords no indication whatever of the volume which that trade might ultimately assume in the presence of a railway and under those conditions of civilization that commonly follow a railway. 2. If any weight were to be attached to our returns, they must be held to discourage very strongly a project that involves large expenditure and other res ponsibilities. And while it might be argaed that the discouraging character of our facts is due in part to unfavourable—and abnormally unfavourable—condi tions not directly related to transportation, we have, on the other hand, been told by our Consuls that some of the progress shown by the trade statistics of this region is to be ascribed to the temporary inseeu.ity cf some other routes. 3. ° I also think that the Board cf Trade view of the value of the railway for trade purposes is much nearer the truth than that of Sir Il^nry Mc.Iahon. In fact I agree generally with the Board of Trade. But then I really have no argument that I could oppose effectively to the local knowledge at kir Henry McMahon. And I agree with him that, having regard to the conditions under which it almost certainly would be constructed, the railway stands to do a great deal more for Russian than for Indian trade, Indian trade with Persia can be served best by railways from the seaboard. Otherwise we lose the benefit of cheap ocean carriage with its concomitant advantage of the estab lishment at the coast of an entrepot that has many of the characteristics of a base in which trade can exercise a good deal of 1 ^dependence and mobility. lit oral lines (and it will be strange if it does net) sucti pa ucipauon wm be deplorable^ I agree therefore that the immediate construction of a line to the Gulf should by one means or another be assured. How it can be assured is another matter. . .. 4 But if it can be assured, then we may-even while concerning ourselves primarily with trade-look at the new inland P^t with a wrder • pw can be obtained through the medium of tiade statistics, we know that such concrete facts as are capable of e ^ ac ‘ T a b S ^ re “° e f u i n ° by themselves furnish an a ^ a ‘ e /S ^ny P one In have watched a railway in a law ? 0 ^ n ^ politics) for a number of years and have the course of Persian tic (&lt; P ' furnished by our officers studied the greatly unproved reports that a,e now ' impediments to in those regions without notmnis that m^t ot the main ^ ^ progress of ail sorts are precisely ( °‘„f 8 improv^ed transportation; ^ ho maJ competitive with thecharges for other forms of transport when the com mod hies to he handled are of comparatively low specific value or such as do not call ior much expedition in getting them to their market. But^those obstacles that consist in alt brigandage, official and unofficial, in the difficulties related to exchange and # remittance, in the corruption and inefficiency of the Courts, in the conditions of credit, in the uncertainty as to the identity, the real residence, and the solvency of one’s buver, in the long delay that occurs between the placing and the execution of an order, and in the impracticability of efficient supervision and control of the agencies in Persia—to say nothing of the general political conditions that affect other things as well as trade, all these obstacles must almost certainly persist until a railway opens the country up. In fact it may be taken that until the country is so opened up the progress of penetration or assimilation cannot really begin and instability must continue. Under present conditions avc are more or less shut out; but Russia has been able to make better progress than we. Ko doubt the new railway will serve her better than it Avill us, but it Avill serve us too, and on the whole it would, I think, create a greater likelihood of our getting even with Russia than can he said to exist at present. en if it did not better our position relatively to that of Russia, is there any likelihood whatever that its prospect of doing so would be improved by delay ? So far as the “ man in the street” can see there is no such likelihood—quite the contrary. It is almost incredible that the more intimate ,s commerce,” mere int ile and social, that would attend the creation of a railway could fail to bring about some sort of assimilation of that part of Persia which is nearest our borders. I should imagine that from a political point of view this would he worth something even if the railway did not pay for a good many years. I should not expect it to pay in the literal s j nse until the process of assimilation had gone pretty far. Por Indian trade comprises few commodities of such high specific value as would stand cumulative railway freights of a large amount, and I imagine that, in respect of these commodities, most shippers to and from Europe would prefer the greater security of transport by sea over routes that are well policed. Even in my time, the Constantinople Express \i T as held up once or twice in Europe when it was believed that it carried much treasure. As regards trade with Persia it is fairly certain that the risk Avould be accepted in respect of precious stones and of specie for settlement of debts; for the conditions on our side would be a great deal better than those now present. And it is very probable indeed that the railway would carry northwards substantial quantities of textiles (silk, aa t oo1 and cotton), sugar, tea, coffee and sundry manufactures of fairly high specific value. Rut I hold that even for these the natural channel would be the Gulf and the railway from the Gulf. The 31st December 1910. E. Koel Paton. Enclosure No. 4. ('Memorandum by the General Staff on the proposed Trans-Tersian Railway.) i The General Staff are concerned only with the “probable effect of the Enclosure No. 5 to Secretary of St&amp;te’a despatch Scheme * * On the strategic position of the Ko * s2 - Indian Empire ”. In considering this strategic aspect of the proposal the General Staff wish to emphasize the fact that any material imprevement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India and of the Empire. When discussing the strategic problem of a possible approach of Russian railways to Afghanistan Mr. Raltour stated : “ if Russian strategic railways are allowed to creep closer and closer to the frontier which we are bound to defend: then this country will inevitably pay for its supineness by having to keep on foot a much larger army than anything which any of us can contemplate with equanimity. Foresight and courage can obviate these dangers, without foresight and courage they may come upon us : and if they14 &lt;!o comp upon ns \re shall be throwing upon our children, if not upon our selves, the greatest military problem that has ever c* nfronted the Government of this countryThe figures in Appendix A show the largely increased forces which Russia will he able to develop on the North-West Frontier of India and Afghanistan as soon as the proposed line is completed. 2. It is true that our present friendship with Russia renders improbable any hostile act on her part against India, but that friendship cannot be regarded as permanent. As late as 1903 Major-General Gruloff of the Russian General Staff wrote : “ the struggle between Russia and Britain for political supremacy in Persia has been postponed but not concluded”. It is from this struggle that hostilities may ensue in future. The present entente therefore does not warrant the abandonment of sane and vigilant precautions. It will he seen then that the previous military policy of India has been based upon maintaining its strategic isolation, so that attack becomes, if not impossible, at all events so difficult and lengthy an operation as to involve very great financial strain on the attacking power, and to ensure that before decisive hsue is joined, the whole military strength of the British Empire will he available. 3. While it is the duty of the General Staff to emphasize the great strategic advantage of the natural barriers in the defence of India and the consequent disadvantage of piercing this barrier at any point by a railway, still it is fully realized that a through connection by railway from Europe to India is a development of civilization which cannot be resisted permanently. The advocates of the scheme lay stress on choosing an alignment “ for which its importance for transit is its very first consideration, every thing else Being secondary or auxiliary”. At the same time, vhile safeguarding Russia’s strategic requirements they recognize that some alignments, e.g., the construc tion of a line from Merv to Meshed, “would be strategically rather dangerous for the English”. They evidently therefore anticipate difficulties on our part, and, assuming that a line will ultimately he constructed, the problem becomes one of rendering it as strategically innocuous to India as possible, by find in 0, some artificial obstacle which will in some measure take the place of the natural harrier which it is proposed to pierce, so that the strain thrown, upon toe military resources of the Empire in the event of foreign aggresdon may be neither too sudden nor too severe for them to bear. In the opinion of the General Stalf such a substitute can only be found in making use of our preponderating sea power, as a means of control of the proposed line and in adequate fortification, at some distance from the frontier of India, of a naval base through which the proposed line must run. 4. So far in this memorandum the problem has been considered solely from the local point of view of the defence of India from aggression, but Other factors of importance demand attention in connection with this aspect of he case. 5. It has been a cardinal point of our strategy to retain strategic control the Persian Gulf. If any sea Power other than Great Britain should obtain preponderance or even a secure base in the Gulf, it is clear that the problem )f the defence of Indian ports and the safety of transports bringing reinforce- nents from home would be at onee made more difficult. A railway rising dose to tlie littoral and under control of any other Power would afford that Power claims to a port on the Gulf which will he hard to resist, i'rom the possession of a port to the formation of a fortified base will be a natural step. 6. Should Itussia adhere “ to her usual policy of cautious absorption” by a gradual occupation of the provinces of Herat and Afghan lurkestan, the highest authorities are of opinion that we should bo forced at some period or other to adopt the Kabul-Kandahar line in our plan cf defence, and that action to rause the invader to evacuate Afghanistan would have to betaken elsewhere. Su^ action will be facilitated, if we can, by the selection of a suitab o ali'nment for tills railway and the permanent exclusion of any possi a alternative alignment, caui Russia to expose to ns a vulnerable point withm reach of our sea power.7 The approach of the Baghdad Railway to the Golf gives another facte? that requires consideration. If the Power exploiting that line succeeds in obtaining a terminus on the Gulf, the extension of the railway through Southern Persia towards India will probably he pressed. Such an extension under the auspices of a Power potentially hostile to Great B Ram will greatly complicate our strategic position. Advantage should be taken of the opportunity now offered of 'obtaining guarantees that such extension will he under our control. 8. Of minor importance is the consideration that the proposed railway through Persia must break gauge at some point, for the Russian and the Indian systems are on different gauges. This break of gauge will be the weak link in the advance of an enemy alon^ that line. Hence the l)ie&lt;ik of £!auge should ho under our control and should be as far distant ns possible fioin India. 9. If then the strategic disadvantages of the proposed connection are ont- Tveished by other factors, the General Staff consider that the following condi tions should be fulfilled :— (1) The line should he so located that it can he controlled by our sea power through a large portion o( its length. (2) Measures should he included in the schen e which will impose an artificial obstacle to the advance of ary hostile power along the line towards India as a substitute for ihe present natural barriers of mountains and deserts. (3) The complete control of the Gulf should be retained and secured to Great Britain. (4) Advantage should be taken of the opportunity to prevent the possi bility of any third power securing, at some future time, conces sions on or near the Gult littoral. (5) The break of gauge should he distant from the frontier of India and under the control of Great Britain and within, reach of her sea power. (6) No connection between this line and either Afghanistan or Northern Baluchistan should be permitted. (7) The extension of Russian or Persian Hail ways through Afghanistan should be more strongly resisted than ever. 10. To fulfil the first of these conditions it is essential that the railway line should follow the coast for a considerable poriion of its length. 11. To comply with the second, the line must pass through some position suitable for the construction of a fortress of unquestioned strength and offensive power based on the sea. 12. To meet the third condition Bandar Abbas and Ivishm Island must be controlled by Great Britain and garrisoned by British or Indian troops. Further in conformance with the fourth condition the railway concession should stipulate that any branch lines to the Gulf should be made only u ith the consent of Great Brirain and under guarantees that the ports will not be fortified by any other Power. 13. The various alignments are considered in detail in Appendix B. It will be seen that the only alignment that offers suitable substitutes for the strategic disadvantage' of the abandonment of the present policy of the strategic isolation of India is that via Yezd to Bandar Abbas (direct) and thence along the coast to Karachi. But this alignment is in itself very far from being a sufficient safeguard. Bandar Abbas must be fortified and garrisoned permanently by sufficient troops to prevent any attempt to secure it by a coup de main. Within the fortifications should be the break of gauge of the railway. It is by these measures and by these measures alone that we can prevent the construction of a through railway from Europe to India being accompanied by such strategic disadvantages as would demand a very large increase to our military forces both in India and at home. 14. It will he note! that in Appendix B reference is made to-a : proposal to construct a line from Karacni to Seistun. The General Staff consider that16 Scisbti A ptacG 6f great fetfategid importance in a campaign such ks is now being considered. ^ They desire to urge that its possession by us should ^ lie assured by the construction of this line simultaneously with that through Persia, and that the advantage of its possession by Russia, if they anticipate should be nullified by a decision never to extend the Wushki line to Seistan. 15. It remains to Consider what will be the strategic position if these measures are given effect to. It Will be seen from Appendix A, that Russia •Can develop forces of great numerical superiority to those at our disposal. If f^il-head of the Trans-Persiau conhebtion is brought to Nushki, the ultimata victory of Russia can Only be a matter of time. But if the alignment is brought through and controlled at Bandar Abbas, the position is far less un favourable. Por if owing to the difficulties of moving large forces far from rail* ways and the slowness with which such railways can be constructed, Russia should attempt an advance on India along the Trans-Persian railway as a single line of advance, she would he conformed by a fortress based upon our whole sea power. The historical instances of the lines of Torres Yedras and of Port Arthur show the possibilities for the defensive in such a position. If she attempted an advance on the Herat-Helntund line combined with an advaned On the Tians-Persian alignment, Great Britain would have all the Strategid advantage of interior lines. The proposed connection from Karachi to Seistait will enable Great Britain to occupy a strong fl ink position which Russia could not ignore. If neglecting the Trans-Persian alignment, she were to advance on the Herat and Kabul lines alone, her interest in Persia would be open to our attack and our position in the theatres of Afghanistan would be strengthened by the Kafrichi-Seistan connection. 16. The commercial aspects of the scheme are not for the General Staff to consider, but it is permissible to point cut that their proposals coincide with the views of the Bo-»rd of Trade who consider that a line to a well known Gulf port, preferably Bandar Abbas, is a sine qud non* D. HAii, 3rd January 1011* Chief of the General Staff* Appendix A* Summary of present strategic position* In the strategmal study of the North-West Frontier of India it is cal culated on the assumption that ell forage required for transport animals can be obtained locally in the country and will not have to be brought from Russia, that the Russians can develop the following forces on the different lines of advance in the time stated in each case, from the date of Russian mobilisation commencing. On the Northern or Kabul line— Two months Pour mouth* 38.000 on the Oxus. 13.000 on the Ghori Plain 14.000 Task Kurghan and Kunduz 10.000 Deb Dadi Rail-head i* r ad vancing and sup plies are being collected.

On the Southern or Kandahar Line f 6,000 at Herat; Two month* etn nnc at C Iishk&gt; Four months 8eren months r 50 000 at Farah The advanced troops ml] he spread j about Sabzawar and perhaps soma J will be in Seistan.

By this time a serious engage ment will have been fought and the position will depend on its result. In the calculations on which the above results are based, it is assumed that the advance of the Russians on both lines vwll be opposed both by the Afghans and the British ; but as all forage for franco.t animals cerUinly cannot be obtained locally, the above calculations are optimistic. 2. With the above results as a guide, it is estimated that when the proposed trans-Persian Une is built to Nushki, and piovided with piopec Jidia-s, the Russians oul l in addition to the* lorces mentioned in para-nph l develop the following forces on or within our fruitier in Baluchistan, where the new line will cross it; i.e., some 1,200 miles in advance of tutir present frontier at Julfa.

In support, of the above estimate it may he stated that in the Russo- Japanese AVar, Russia succeeded in placing in Manchuria at the end of a single line of rails some 4,0U0 miles from Samara, where the Orenberg lin° bifurcates from the Siberian one, not loilh** a puling the hr ak in the line that existed at Lake Baikal during the eatlg months of the war :— From date of Prussian mobilization commencing— One month ...

But it must he remembered that Russia obtained a very large proportion of her supplies and forage on the spot in Manchuria, which would not be possible In an advance on India through Persia and Baluchistan.

Alternative alignments considered. The possible alignments of the through connection are— (1) Nushki-Seistan-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (2) Karachi-Seistan (direct)-Yezd-Tehran. (3) Karacki-Charbar-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (4) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (5) Karachi-Bandar Abhas-Yezd (direct)-Tehran. (6) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Shiraz-Julfa. The Nushki alignment is the one proposed in the enclosure to the Secre tary of State’s despatch. It is at no portion of its length subject to control by the sea po*ver of Great Britain. It would enable Russia in the event of war to turn the Kandahar and Quetta portions an 1 to de/elop on the borders of India a force far stronger tlnn we could oppose with Indian troops alone and to do so probably before wo could obtain reinforcements from home. It is for this reason that the General Staff urge that no extension of the Nushki lino should evei be undertaken. There is no position on this rou'e suitable for a strong fortress that could delay the advance &lt; f Rus^r/s laud forces, dhis alignment possesses in fact every strategic disadvantage. The A arachi-Seistan - Tehran alignment comes within the control of sea power at Karachi, but it possesses nearly all the disadvantages of t :o Nushki connection. The portion from Karachi to Seistan direct would be however advantageous to India as it would facilitate the movement of reinfj;cements from home to the theatre of war near Seistan. The Karachi-Charbar-Kerman alignment is control Id by sea power as far as Charbar, but the alignment at Kerman is dangerously close (260 miles) to Seistan. In the event of an advance by Russia her forces operating irom the rail wav at Kerman and from Kushk p ist would be able to c &gt;n cent rate in overwhelmin'* force on Sri-tan and thence to advance on India. The llelmund position would be tu ned by the force from Kerman an 1 we should be forced to accept decisive battle at the very gates of India near Quetta with inferior forces. As regards the two suggested alignments (I) and (6) the military objec* tions appear to he — _ # . . . The Kerman alignment brings Russia within 2G0 miles of Soistan and has the same objections as route (-f). The Shiraz alignment, is open to control by set power throughout the treater norfion of its length, but the power administering the hue vuii absorb Almost at once tho Persian littoral. This alignmeut would etieetnallv check r^msn extension into Persia.

(Memorandum by tic President of the fiaihcay Board) The proposal appears (according to the pap™ received under Secretary of State's despatch * 0 . 32, dated 4th November 1910) to he rn To l.uild a railway from Baku rid Eosht, Tehran Kum, Ispahan ( 1 ) 10 b n u ^ oz ” to K y orman and across the desert to Se.stan where a junction would bo made with a hue to be made by ludu ftom Nushki.The memorandum drawn up hy the Ttussian Consortium reeo^et Seistanas the point of junction as it states “the nearest point of the British Indian system is Nushki from where the English are carrying a line to Seistan *\ (2) The line to be built as an international one by Russia, France and England. 2. The Secretary of State asks that the scheme be considered by the Gov* ernment of India both from the commercial point of view and also in respect to its immediate local consequences. He also requests that the Government of India will take into consideration the question of the railway connec tion between the Russian and Indian systems in general. 3. Taking first the commercial and immediate local consequences, it may he said that— (•) As a through line connecting India and Europe, the proposal has no claim to any meiit from the Indian commercial point of view. The possibility of goods traffic being canied by the line between . England and India is quite out of the question. («) The difference in length between the rail and sea route to India, taking Karachi as a centre, null be very small, and the sea routo w ill always be by far the cheaper in cost of transport of goods, * besides being more convenient and also shorter to places in the south of India. (Hi) As regards passenger traffic, the volume of such traffic between England and India is of no great magnitude, and it would b 0 years after the proposed line had been built, before a well* j organicd service could be instilled between Calais and Ind a* over the many different lines with various breaks of gauge ove# which it would have to run in Europe. Moreover, a passenger to any part of India except the north would find that when he had added the cost of his railway ticket from Nushki to his destina tion in India, the total cost of his rail ticket from Calais to destination in India would be higher than the steamer far® which he would have to pay, as steamers have at the present time a large margin within which to reduce their fares, lit regard to passenger traffic between England and India the prac tical effect of the building of the railway will probably ha that steamer lares will be reduced and they will still retain the traffic. Further passenger traffic between Europe generally and India must be small. There is no emigration traffic, such as the Siberian line carries and much revenue from this class ol business could not be expected. 4. The Siberian Railway cannot be taken as a parallel case on which any assumption can be built. The Siberian Railway route shortens the distance between the centre of Europe and the Ear East by a half. Moreover, it gives a direct railway route, much shorter than the sea route, to an area of country infinitely larger than India comprising, as it does, the important ports of China and Japan. ' The P^nger traffic over the Siberian Railway is most cosmopolitan ifi character and of very considerable volume, due to the big interest which most of the European countries have in the Ear East. . 6 * ^ hen 1 travelled by the Siberian line from Port Arthur to Moscow in 1904, there were express through trains running every other day, the Wagon Hits Company providing every alternate train between Irkutsk ‘and Moscow. Binee 1904, the traffic has still further increased and the Wagon Lits Company now run their trains ; there were also daily trains running at slower speed. - 6. In addition to the tlirongh passenger traffic the Siberian line serves most important towns ia. Asiatic Russia, and atfords a convenient means of transport of goods to areas which before could only have been served by a long sea route and a troublesome land journey by cart*—&amp; — ^uasicti uui Uie mam amerence that the Siberian line cenneots Europe by a short route with a larse cosmopolitan population in the Jar East, and opens up a cheaper route than the sea route for trade commodities, whereas the use ot the through line between Russia and India only offers an alternative route to passengers between England and India with the disadvantage or a convenient and cheaper sea route to compete against, serving all the ports and different parts of the coast of India. Asa through line, therefore, between England and India, the scheme commercially has nothing to recommend it as a means of carriage either for goods or passengers — - ■ v ^ V 1 ». 11 CVVXV' » * V » l.

KS lAV IX U I I I IX W I L kJ ▼ IU XV se(‘ms obvious that Russia, and other European countries adjacent, would have a great advantage over England in developing the trade of Northern and West* ern Persia, but India should secure the trade of Southern Persia and Seistan. 9. As a railway proposition, however, it is not a scheme whiidi one could recommend the Government of India to have anything to do with from the financial point of view T ; hut the line is one of quite an unusual character and it has to be considered from other points than those affecting railway finance. 10. The attitude of India towards the scheme must obviously he largely based on the political situation. It seems clear that both Russia and Germany intend exploiting Northern and Western Persia and, if this cannot he avoided, the main point for consideration would seem to be to decide how the inevitabia can he turned to some use for India and the Empire as a whole, 11. In the original Russian note, enclosure No. 1 to Secretary of State’s despatch No. 32, dated 4th November 1910, great stress is I tid on the neces sity for the project being international. The words used are “ we could hardly hope for success if we started by dividing the line geographically into a Russian section in the Russian sphere of influence, and an English section in the English sphere”. From the telegram from the Secretary of State, dated the 30th December, however, it seems probable that Russia and Germany aro coming to terms, which looks very much as if the international character of the through line would be put in the background, Russia with Germany’s consent making the line a Russian one in North Persia. 32. That North Persia will be opened out by a railway which will either be international or Russian seems certain and what India has now to do is to take advantage of the present position to consolidate itself in Southern Persia. The course indicated seems clear, and it is to welcome cordially the proposed through line as an international railway and to agree at once to make as part of the Indian Railway system a line from Nushki to some point iu Seistan which is suitable for a junction with the international railway. 13. The ready acceptance by India of the international scheme would he a useful card in the direction of counteracting the negotiations now in progress between Russia aud Germany which may lead to Northern Persia bein&lt;* opened out by a Russian railway wi ,h the same objects as were m mind when the Manchurian line was constructed to Port Arthur. 14. At the same time it would politically seem to justify India taking immediate steps to begin making the line from Nushki to Seistan, as practical evidence of its desire to carry out the international scheme and to do its snare as soon as possible. Whatever might be the eventual outcome ot the proposed through line, India, at any rate, would have secured access on its own rails to Seistan and South Persia, whether the through line were made or not. 15 The line from Nushki to Seistan, which should be made solely by India must cross over the border and have its terminus m Seistan at a place SleTr a big railway terminus for reasons of practical railway working.21 16 The point of junction between the international railway and the Indian Bystem of railways will be a place of lar^e importance, and an essential condi- tion is that it should be at a site where an ample supply of water was available, both for residential and railway working purposes, and this can only be found § in Seistan. 17 Incidentally it may be remarked that there should be a change of gauge ‘ a t this point of junction, and it would be as well at this stage to leave undecided tbe question of the gauge to be finally adopted between Nushki and Seistan, as a smaller gauge than that adopted for the international line has considerable advantages as regards the difficulties of converting it to a wider gauge if the line was in tbe future ever likely to be made use of for purposes of the invasion of India. IS. The policy proposed would not place on India a financial risk of a character different to what she has cheerfully embarked on in the past in respect to frontier railways. Up to the present time a sum of approximately 25 to 30 crores of rupees have been spent on lines essentially made for military reasons. A sum of half a crore of rupees has only ju«t been recently spent on the Loi-Shilman Railway, in order to provide a line still incomplete and ending at a place that makes it of no practical use for any purpose either military or commercial. 19. In the case of the proposed line from Nushki, it could he extended to Seistan for a sum of three crores of rupees approximately. For such an important political object three crores is a very small sum. Besides this, granted a stable government in Persia, Seistan is a valuable area to tap by a railway, a matter which, I believe, has been dealt with fully by Sir Henry McMahon in his report on Seisttn. * 20. The Nushki-Seistan route seems the best to adopt for linking up the Indian Railway system with the international line for the following reasons:— (a) It falls in with the proposals of the Russian Consortium and its cor struction by India would not excite any particular comment and be comidered as simply carrying out a scheme that had already been decided on. * The route would lie for practically the whole length in territory urdcr British influence, Persian territory only being entered upon to the extent necessary to carry the rails to the site most suitable in Seistan for the establishment of the big junction station contemplated there. (J) On the other hand, a line from Karachi to Seis f an traverses an extremely difficult country and would be costly to build and work. The Karachi-Bandar Abbas alignment would most probably give rise to very considerable political objection on the part of Russia. It would be avoiding the direct route and its cost would be very heavy indeed. It would also probably be urged that the adoption of this alignment was obviously with the intention of placing India in a specially fa/ourable position as regards South Persia. (&lt;o The Nuskhi-Seistan line will be far cheaper, the probable figures of cost based on Mr. Johns* reconnaissance would probably be— Nushki to Seistaa „ ... 3 crores of rupees; Karachi to Seistan ... ... ditto. Karachi to Bandar Abbas ... 20* crores of rupees; assumed figures; it would cer tainly be more than the line to Seistan. The cost of this line would be extremely heavy, running as it would do across the hills coming down to the sea aud . , . , having to pass over a great many creeks aud estuaries. * Siuce estimated at U cruies, vide euclusure Mu. 7.1 22 * From the point of view of railway working the ronto rid Nushki would involve all traffic being carried up to the Quetta plateau and down again, but similar conditions would prevail with Karachi- fceistan line as the country between these places rises to the same heights as the Quetta plateau. 21 . TTith regard to the probable cost of the whole international railway, the only information that may throw some light on this point is a note by Captain Hopkins on the country between Seistan and Kerman. The note in question does not give any estimate of the probable cost of making a railway between these two points; but the section of the cmntry given shows its heavy character, and I estimate that a line between these two points would cost 2 $ lakhs a mile, or for 300 miles the sum of 7J crores of rupees. 22 . Considering this figure and the nature of the rest of the country to he traversed between Kerman and the Russian frontier, it seems highly probable that the cost of the proposed international railway from Seistan to Baku will be very much higher than 20 miLion pounds, i fancy that 30 to 40 millions sterling would be nearer the mark. 23. There are other railway points that require to be touched on, assuming the international line does take shape. The Germans may be relied on to umke every eifort to connect their Baghdad line with the proposed inter national line, ana they would tl.en compete for North and Western Persian traffic, and probably also aim at a line parallel with the Persian Gulf coast and serving all the ports there. The promoters of the international line should, therefore, insist as pa^t of the concession to be given by Persia that they should hold the s&lt; le right of railway construction in Persia, India having the right to make its line from Nushki to such point in Seistan as would alford a proper and suitable terminus for the junction of the Indian railway system with the international railway. 24. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has touched on this con- tin^enev, and his remedy is for Russia to press for certain branch line con cessions in the north, and tor Rngland to do the same for branches^ in tho south. I venture to suggest that, if the main through line is to be interna tional, it should follow that all branches off and to it in Persia should also be international, as this seems to be the only way in which British trade m Northern Persia and now delivered at and exported from Gulf and ports by sea could he preserved. 25 With the branch lines in the north belonging to Russia, English trade would be treated differentially, whereas under our methods we should make no distinction of country, in the rates which we should charge for goods over our branches. Bv insisting on branches being all international equal treatment wnnkl 1 e preserved for tbe countries interested internationally in the line, and it would be possible under the international arrangement to treat the countries ownin* the ine preferentially. Moreover, insisting on all branches in Persia bein» part of the international arrangement affords the best protection against the development of German trade in Persia, as the branches would be made in the interests of the trade of the countries concerned in the international lines and the rates to be charged would be fixed with this object. 26 . In connection with this matter, it would be advisable to insist, as part of the international scheme, on branches being made from Bandar Abbas to ^Vrman and from Bushire via Shiraz to Ispal.an, leaving it to Russia and F “to add in tbe north rny other branches which they might like to include in the w T hole project. 07 The matter of rates to be quoted on the international lines would bo ^ 7 . ice maLLci ui n t would control the area an extremely dithault question to de^ with, as tM r which each country could command J would be useful to important ^ charged should be the subject of special agreement^etween the parties nolding the concession for the international lines.23 28. To sum up I venture to think that the attitude of India towards this matter should be— (1) To cordially accept and support the proposal that an international line should be made from Seistan to Baku. (2) To assist in this project India would build at once, with its own funds, the line from Nushki to Seistan and include it in her railway system. The gauge of this line at the present time to be left to India to decide, but it be made an essential point that a break of gauge shoull occur at Seistan junct'on. (3) The sole right to make railways in Persia should be secured by the concessionaires of the international line and all branches should be built internatioially. w The basis on which railway rates are to be charged should be a matter for future consideration and agreement. (5) Detailed surveys of the Nushki-Seistan should be put in hand at once. 29. If it is ultimately decided that India should support the proposed international line all branches to be made under the same international arrange* ment, the branches from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Bushire to Ispahan being essentially parts of the whole project, if possible, it would be very advisable to urge the claim of India to be allowed to actually construct these two branches for the international Company. The international scheme in character is very like the Suez canal and Panama canal projects and enormous sums will be spent on flotation and large profits made out of placing and carrying out contracts, and it will be a long time before the public can be educated up to taking up shares. On economical grounds, therefore, it would be of advantage to have these tw T o branches constructed by Indian agency, and it would be of still greater advantage if India offered to find the money to build these two lines in anticipation of the actual promotion of the international Company and the finding of its capital. If the international scheme faiAd to mature, India would be left with two useful branches in Persia secured by taking advantage of the present state of affairs. 30. As an official reason why India should make these branches it might be urged that she has immense experience of the construction of railways in countries like Persia, that she has staff and material ready at hand and could begin work at once and carry it out economically. T. R. Wynne, president, Railway Board. 6th January 1911.24 Enclosure No. 6. Report of the Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. . The proposal of the Russian Consortium on which the Secretary of State asks the ©pinion of the Government of India, is the construction of a railway line from Baku to Tehian, thence via Kum, Kashan, k ezd to Kerman, and thence to Nushki via Seistan.* It is stated that the construction of a railway in Persia is not an object complete in itself, but simply a means towards the realisation of “a world route to unite by one •ontmuous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the Ear East”. The more immediate object of the promoters appears to be the development of Russian trade with Persia, which is now threatened by the Baghdad Railway and the increasing- interest of Germany in the Middle East. It is also remarked incidentally that the line would •ecure Russia's strategic position in Turkey and in Western Trans-Caucasia. The line is to be constructed as an international undertaking, the participants being Russia, Great Britain, France and possibly Persia, The cost of construction is estimated at £06,950,Odd roubles and the possible profits at 15 per cent on the subsc.ibed capital. The Government of India are asked for their views on the question of railway connec tion in general and the particular proposal put forward in the Russian memorandum, and their advice is specially asked upon the commercial aspects of the project, and its immediate local consequences. 2. It may be convenient at the outset to offer a few observations on the general Advantages and com of a connection by land between Europe and India by way of a disadvantages ^ ^ ^ of railway connection The question may first he considered from the point of view of the defence of India Europe 1 and against foreign invasion. By the operation of the Anglo-Russian Conveition we are secured India- for the present from the fear of a Russian invasion of ludit, but in the nature of things (a) Strategical the possibility of hosti ities with Russia at some future ditecanuot altogether be ignored. ail{ ^ P°^ oa ^ In view of this possibility it is clear that any material improvement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India,—responsibilities which are already inconveniently heavy. From the purely strategical point of view therefore ic would undoubtedly be preferable that India should mnntain her ^Man-insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her frontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of isolation can be indefinitely maintained. Th? advent of the Baghdad Railway combined with the impotence of Persia must inevitably disturb the status quo, while the prospect of a Russo-German combination in the event of our refusal to co-operate in the Russian scheme compels us to reconsider the position from a wider outlook. From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers for securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous. question of the pros an Trans-Persian Railway 3. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we ^ commeroiaL are in general agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office of 13th September 1910 and in Mr. Worthiugton ? s memorandum forwarded therewith^ We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being carried on the railway from the United Kingdom to India or vice-versa. The cost of transport by sea, especially to the south of India, will always be cheaper than by rail, and the sea route will have the further advantage of avoiding the re-handling of the goods at a continental port and at the points at which breaks of gauge may occur. We are inclined to doubt also whether the through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude. The volume of such traffic between the United Kingdom and India is not very large or likely to increase in any considerable degree, since there is no emigration to India such as is canied on the trans-Siberian line; and it seems probable that a reduction in farts would enable the steam-ship companies to retain the bulk of the existing traffic. As regards the local traffic northwards from India into Persia, no doubt the railway would lead to some development of this trade, but it is imposs ble to form any estimate as to the amount of such increase in view of the wide difference between the conditions under which the traffic is now carried on and those which would be created by the existence of the railway. The natural channel for Indian trade to Persia is • A subsequent telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 30ih December, shows that the Hussian Consortium now favour an^li-nment via Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, but that the Russian Government prefer that th. line should ruu from Tehran south-east to Kerman to avoid the possible risk of ereutual intersection b/ a Cierma* line at Ispahan.25 . have little tne construction of line* througli the ports of the Persian &gt; ^ treater benefit from the purely commercial from those ports into the .or would be ol much g.eat ^ 1^ ^ we are point of view than the construction o£ ivenby the Consortium of the revenue unable to accept as in any way accurate the est ™ a ' e ^ ay b / expected from the line.

But we cannot avoid the conclusion thaf a line following the route proposed by the Consortium advantao-eous to Russian than to Indian trade, though this result mi ht be neutial ed ?o some 0 extent if we were able to secure that branch lines should be simultaneous y constructed toconnect the Gulf ports, such as Bandar Abbas and Bushire, with the mmn line. We also consider that it would be essential that stipulations should be insisted npn to insure that there shall be no differential treatment on any part of the railway for the nationals of any country in respect of rates, fares or general facilities. 4. While, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little question that the maintenance of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful whether the advantages^ Indian trade would at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with f e . rsU &gt; with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that havino- regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be ^ Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining conces- sions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will he well advised to accept in principle the proposals ot the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may D considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. 5. We will now proceed to examine in detail the various proposals which have been made and to set forth the conditions which we consider to be essential before the Governmen of India agree to participate in the pioposed undertaking. The first question to be considered is that of the alignment of the main through l.ne between Russia an 1 India. With the northern portion of the alignment between Baku ana Yezd we are only remotely concerned, but we think it right to notice that the a ignmen proposed by the Consortium, ^Tehran. Kum, Kashan, Ispahan and Yezd, is preferable on commercial grounds to the direct line fiom Tehran to Kerman proposed by the Russian Government, since the latter would leave untapped the important trade centres ot Rum, Kashan and Ispahan. 6. Fiom the Indian point of view the important part cf the alignment is that by which the railway approaches the frontier of India, namely, the portion from Yezd onwards. Ihree alternative routes have been suggested, namely,— (1) The proposal of. ; the Consortium, which is also favoured by Sir Henry McMahon, for a line from Yezd to Kerman and thence across the desert to Seistan and Nushki. Length approximately 810 miles. (2) The route suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, viz. t Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Repan, Barnpur, Sarbaz, thence across the Perso-British frontier near Kej and thence to Karachi or Hyderabad. Length approximately 1.117 miles. (3) The route advocated by the Indian General Staff, m , Yezd to Bandar Abbas and thence miles. along the coast to Karachi. Length approximately l,34ilThe relative advantages and disadvantages of these three routes are examined in the •ucceeding paragraphs:— If the object of the proposed railway be taken as the connection of Russia with India if” by the quickest, cheapest and easiest route, this alignment seems to be preferable to align* either of the other two which have been suggested. The distance between Yezd and ment. Nushki vid Kerman and Seistan is 810 miles only as compared with 1,147 and 1,341 miles between Yezd and Karachi by the other two routes: and although Karachi is immeasurably superior to Nushki as a point of junction with the Indian railway system and as a distributing centre for goods, the difference in length between the Nuskhi and Karachi routes remains an important factor in the situation. There would, it is true, be engineering difficulties to surmount in crossing the mountains which surround Kerman, and the scarcity of fresh water in the desert between Kerman and Nasratabad and between Robat and Nushki mi°’ht also be a source of considerable inconvenience. But the route lies in the main through flat country which, as would appear from the _ reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in 19U3, would present few obstacles to railway construction. It is also a point in favour of this alignment that it would give access to the rich and well-watered tract of Seistan, which, in the opinion of so well-informed an authority as Sir H. McMahon, is capable of rapid development if a market can be found for its surplus products. But against these advantages have to be set objections, both strategical and political, the importance of which can hardly be overstated. To take the political objections first- it cannot be doubted, in view of the attitude taken by the Amir ot Afghanistan towards the Anglo-Russian Convention, that His Majesty will regard the construction of a railway along his Southern border as a further indication of a design on the part of Russia to impair his independence, if not to absorb his territories. This aspect of the question has been touched on bv Sir H. McMahon in paragragh 15 of his report, but with all respect to is au i y we doubt whether he has adequately recognised the gravity of the objection to lisUn-Nushki aLnment on this' score. 0 However baseless the idea may be there 'll nnf he wanting advisers who will put a sinister construction on the pioject in its lelat.on to AMtran^w the atom and suspicion that will be engendered may g.ve L to tr bal excitement which may prove beyond H,s Majesty’s power to control The construction ^^^^^^^jihee^in^^etween^iV'Britisl^Government'mid the ruler rndp^lVof Afghanistan, “e® ^t'!he tl of “eJa/d on which the adoption of this route would give to Russia ^ Va/totum the Kandahar and of Afghanistan, and would enable her m th^ o£ a very large Quetta positions.

We have taken the latter as being on the more direct route. Our remarks apply with slight modification to the routes via Gwetter aud Gwadur. Taking now the comparative advantages of the two routes ending at Karachi, we may first give a general description of the country on the Pasni, * Bampur, Bam, Kerman and Yezd alignment. The length of the route, as taken from the route books, is 1,147 miles From Karachi to Pasni (296 miles) the line would run in the vicinity of the sea shore- the u , ... . S rai J e W0 Y ld t' 6 ^vel and the chief works would be those connected with the crossing of creeks and drainage from the hills The only point of doubt in respect of this portion of the route is whether the fresh water supply for working locomotives would be sufficient. This is a matter which will need careful invest! gation. At Pasni the line would turn to the north-west and running by a sloping hilly country for 150 miles woa]d cross a range 3,000 feet high, dropping beyond to a Wei of 1,500 feet. From this point there would again be a steady rise till about the 800th mile where a very sharp rise would have to be faced, the line to reach Kerman bavin* to cross a ridge 8,400 feet high and dropping into the town beyond to 5,600 feet level. From Kermau to Yezd the line would be at a high level, but with no ranges of any height to cross In the absence of any information as to the cost of making railways in'Perda it is difficult to frame any estimate of the cost of this section of the line. But labour and supplies would be scarce and, in view of the engineering difficulties of the alignment the cost of construction and cost of working would certainly be very high. In’ so far as we are able to frame an estimate, we would put the cost rf the section between Karachi aud Yezd vid Pasni and Kerman at not less than 17 crores ot rupees. a Turning to the alternative route, viz , from Karachi along the coast to Bandar Abbas and thence direct to Yezd, the section as far as Bandar Abbas should offer no particular difficulties as regards construction, and it would provide a level road +o run over. From Bandar Abbas to Yezd the general slope of the country is easy and there is no abrupt rise such as is met on the Pasni-Kerman section. As an engineering proposition, therefore, the sec:ion from Bandar Abbas to Yezd does not appear to be open to any great objection. We estimate the cost of constructing the entire line from Karachi to Yezd via Bandar Abbas roughly at 14 crores of rupees, as against 17 crores for the Yezd-Kerman-Karacbi route. As a through route between Russia and India it would certainly be quicker than the Kerman route, though of o-r&gt;ater length, since the easier grades would permit of a faster train service. This alignment*also possesses the strategical advantages— ° (1) That it avoids bringiug the through line to Kerman, which is only 283 miles from the Afghan border. (2) That the entire route from Bandar Abbas to Karachi will lie sufficiently near the coast to allow ^he co-operation of the sea and land forces of the Empire in its defence. . , The Bandar Abbas-Karachi coast line would, it is true, do little towards developipo- trade with the interior of Persia, but we would propose, if this route is adopted, that a branch line should be run either from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan and Bam with a possible later extension to Kerman. The connection of Kerman with a port on the coast by means of a branch line would have this advantage over its inclusion in the main through route that it would enable Indian commerce to compete for the south-eastern Persian market on more favourable terms than would be the case if Russia were able to transport her goods direct to We wouM recommend, therefore, that on strategical and political grounds the Govern ment ot India should express a strong preference for the connection with Karachi and that of the two possible routes connecting Karachi with the main line, they should select that via Bandar Abbas and Yezd as being the easier, quicker, more economical, and more advan tageous from the point of view of military defence. 8. We have next to consider the important question of the branch lines to bo constructed in the event of the proposals for the through route coming to maturity! Assuming that the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki alignment is rojected, there wilTbe no absolute necessity from the commercial or strategical point of view for the construction of a* branph from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, but, as we have already indicated, it would be most desirable that, with a view to the development of our trade with Persia, entry into the markets of south-eastern Persia should be secured by a branch line from some port on the coast within the British sphere. Whether this brand. shoulJ lead from Bandar Abba, or fromlL olher port, such as Charbar, \\q would leave for luture decision after the routes have been examined, but we think it desirable that in the negotiations to be entered into with Russia it should be stipulated that it should be open to Groat Britain to construct a branch line connecting Kerman with the coast by whatever route may prove to be the most convenient. . lt is important in our opinion to make it a condition of our acceptance of the mam proposal that Russia will support us in obtaining such concessions for branch in tl posit cone not for t agre in t must fore, Bam seen is w line grar hav&lt; Mol com prat to n dela line, rega mou witl the We tuni shoi we i pre] latt woi wit ob\ be wit for be' the Bri zoi tha Pm bro cha wil the Of' It for (ta pla Ks2S in tiiQ neutral zone as will operate to exclude Germany from obtaining a predominating position in the Persian Gulf. The lines which Colonel Cox recommends are:— (1) From Mohammerah to Julfa, (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz t o Kerman. (3) From Bandar Abbas to Shiraz. We concur with Colonel Cox as to the supreme importance of obtaining some such concessions as a condition pi’ecedent to our co-operation in the main through route. We are not aware how far Russia has pledged herself to support Germany in obtaining an outlet for the Baghdad railwav on the Persian Gulf. But there is clearly a danger that, if an agreement is not arrived at between ourselves and Russia on the subject of branch lines in the neutral zone, Germany may subsequently obtain such a position on the. Gulf as must seriously jeopardise our interests, both commercial and strategical. We would there fore, recommend that, in addition to suoporting us in obtaining a concession for a line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam and Kerman, Russia be asked to co-operate with us in securing concessions for railway lines— (1) From Mohammerah to Hamadan, or to such point between Mohammerah and Julfa as will intersect the extension of the Baghdad Railway between Khanikin and Tehran. (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Bandar Abbas. (3) From Bushire to Shiraz and thence to Ispahan . These concessions should, we think, be adequate to prevent the intrns'on of the German line into the neutral zone, provided that a guarantee is obtained from Persia that she will grant no other concessions in this zone which are likely to compete with the lines which we have indicated. The lines from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam or Kerman and from Mohammerah northwards should, we think, be proceeded with simultaneously with toe construction of the main line; the other concessions would not necessarily be utilised in practice, but would be retained for blocking purposes. Meanwhile, it would be an advantage to make detailed surveys of all the proposed routes in order that there may be no unnecessary delay when once it is decided to proceed with any particular scheme. 9 We observe that the Consortium contemplate the internationalisation of the through line We think that in view of the recent negotiations between Russia and Germany m and b r B n 0 J h La nnnnpntmn nf the Baghdad railway with tho through 1 ersian hue, it is of para- liue8 . line We think that in view of the recent negotiations between Russia anu yreimany i,. a . regard to the connection of the Baghdad railway wit.i tho through Persian line, it is of para- liue8 LLnt importance that the through line should be international Otherwise we are faced with the possibility of a Russian line being constructed through Northern Persia linked with the Baghdad railway and operating by differential rates to the detriment of British trade. We consider furtheJthat it would be an advantage, with a view to maintaining full opp r tunities for the development of trade, that all branch lines made within Persia itself, should be internationalised.

A subsidiary question which has to be eonsider^ is that of the adopted q The question for the through route and the p ace ^ o£ India, it is of be located.

But we suggest that, in forward in discussing the question Wlth tb ® % di it WO uld not be out of jdace to state MM 1 •»“'•“ 'SCBSSl.V.’mw sms.T 29 It could be explained that from the British point of vi?w the preferable course is to maintain the strategic isolation of India and to avoid the outlay of vast sums of money on a project which offers but little prospect of financial success or of commarcial advantage; that in agreeing to co-operale with Ru-sia in the construction of the through line, we are making a considerable sacrifice; and that the only stipulations we think it necessary to make are such as will safeguard the vital interests of Great Britain. In return for this sacrifice it would, we suggest, hardly be too much to ask Russia to forego once and for all any design for the extension of the Trans-Caspian Railway along the border of Afghanistan iu the direction of the Indian frontier—an extension which, in tne words of the Russian Consortium, “ would be strategically rat' n er dangerous for the English”. We recommend therefore thfvt, in addition to the other stipulations which we have mentioned, the acceptance of the proposed through connection be made conditional oa the giving of a pledge by Russia that she will pot at any time, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, entertain or sppport any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Petso-Afghan border within Jihe Russian or neutral zones. CwieluMM. 12. To summarise our conclusions we recommend that the Government of India accept the proposals of the Russian Consortium in principle, subject to the following modific ations and conditions:— (а) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi and not at Nushki^; (б) that the rpute from Yezd to Karachi be via Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey; (e) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Char bar to Regan, Bam and Kerman; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas vid Khor Musa, Bebbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan; (d) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great .Britain holding a preponderating share anh Persia being admitted to participate; (e) that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zona be different from that of the line in the Russian zone, and that the break of gauge be at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone ; (/) that in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso- Afghan border within the Russian,or neutral zones. 8tA February 1911. W. H. 0[lae«]. D. Haip, T. R. Wish*. J. B. Wood.30 Enclostjeb No. 7. Vote to President^ Bailway Board's, Memorandum, dated the 6th January 1911. This note was written before I had the opportunity of seeing the Memo- mh um by the General Staff. It dealt entirely with the proposal of the ussian Consortium from the railway point of view irrespective of military and political considerations. P°i n k T should like to modify is my estimate of 20 crores as the cost or a line from Karachi to Bandar Abbas. Erom the information I then had at my disposal it appeared that the cost of the line would be very heavy. When the question was being considered subsequently by the committee I had access to route books of Persia and was able to make a section of the country along the coast and obtain a more accurate idea of the cost of making a line along it. I would therefore ask that the figure of 20 crores which I originally estimated the Karachi-Bandar Abbas line would cost might be reduced to 9 crores. T. It.

Most letters pertain to the charting of possible routes for the proposed railway in relation to British interests vis-à-vis the Russian Empire. Interests are variously defined as either the effects of railway construction on military mobilisation or commercial and trade interests.Correspondence on the railway is mainly between the Government of India, Whitehall, and the Inter-Departmental Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, as well as the Political Resident in Bushire, and Political Agent in Kuwait. Reports from the Inter-Departmental Committee consider a variety of factors such as weather, trade balances of various cities, construction costs, and Russian influence in making recommendations on possible routes. Population statistics and the financial potential of various markets for British goods at various Central Asian and Persian ports, towns and cities are also noted in the reports.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railway construction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Balance of trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000112#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
