P art I.—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—OMAN-MASKAT COAST. The current of events in the Sultanate has, on the whole, moved fairly smoothly during the year. Captain E. G. Beville, Political Agent, has drawn up the report which follows as Part II of this compilation. In order to counteract the very general evasion of punitive tax imposed on the exported produce of the tribes, whose rebellion in 1895 had caused such serious losses to British Indian subjects, the Sultan considered the question of its more universal application, and finally decided, without weighing with sufficient care the probable effects of the measure, to extend it in a modified form, so as to include the produce of the loyal Ghafiri tribes. The ostensible grounds for this measure were solely that much of the produce, specially aimed at by the tax, had contrived to escape under cover of the trade of friendly tribes ; but it seems also possible that there was a hope of thus establishing an additional permanent source of revenue. Discontent naturally resulted, of which Sheikh Saleh bin Ali was prompt to take advantage, to promote a coali tion of the rival factions against the Sultan. In an unimportant chance con flict which ensued, this restless and turbulent Sheikh, who had been the moving spirit in the late rebellion, and who, despite his advanced age,^ still wielded vast influence in Oman, and was the most formidable and persistent opponent of the Sultan's authority, was killed. This event was a serious ow to the spirit of resistance, which was further weakened by timely concession in regard to the contemplated general tax, and which thus became limited mainly to the Beni Ruaheh tribe. After needless delay, a somewhat ill-advised and ill- organised expedition was directed against this tribe, but resulted on y m a further impoverishment of the Sultan's already strained resources. No improvement was secured in the unsatisfactory working of the tax on the original footing, as noticed in last year's report, and the availab e co ec tions only amounted to some $ 20,000 for the period of twenty months, since its imposition in August 1895. A lease of the proceeds of the ax or6 administration report on the persian gulf political $15,000 annually which was finally effected, though falling considerably short of the originally estimated yield, offers better prospects than those hitherto secured. Last year's report explained how the Sultan, after some hesitation and capriciousness, had finally decided to decline the aid of a war vessel, proffered by Government under certain conditions, towards the recovery of Dhofar. A few months ago, however. His Highness' desire for the restoration of his authority in the revolted province was revived, and, notwithstanding the crip pling of his finances which the futile attempt to coerce the Beni Ruaheh had entailed, an expedition was resolved upon. The Government of India assented, at His Highness' request, to give the aid of a man-of-war to support the Sultan's troops, upon the same terms as before, waiving, however, under cer- tain conditions, the insistence upon the exclusion of Sheikh Suleiman bin Suwailim from the Waliship. Complete success attended this enterprise. The Political Agent proceeded to Dhofar in H. M. S. Cossack, and the Sultan deputed his brother Seyed Mahomed bin Turki to accompany the Hesi- dent in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. Captain Beville, conveying a letter from the Resident to the representatives of the rebels, explained to them in a personal interview, the terms offered, and gave them assurances, on the part of the Sultan, of pardon for the past, and just treatment in the future; negotia tions followed, and frequent communications passed, till the opposition was gradually overcome. Some time previously, the Maskat troops had been assem bled at the nearest to the coast of the small group of villages constituting Dhofar, off which H. M. S. Cossack was lying. Just before the expiry of the period granted by the ultimatum which had been communicated to the mal contents, the flags which had defiantly been flown were struck in sign of sub mission, and the satisfactory solution of a formal restoration of the Sultan's authority was thus secured without a resort to force. In pursuance of his cherished policy, the Sultan subsequently sent Sheikh Suleiman to replace the Wali who had been provisionally installed, but accord ing to the latest report, just after the close of the year, had again recalled him in consequence of a disturbance which it is hoped may prove insigni ficant. 0 Indications of an increased activity in the slave trade have been apparent, and it is to be feared that a large number of slaves have been carried from the African coast to Sur, and thence distributed inland and up the coasts of Oman and the Persian Gulf. In May the Political Agent, in the absence of any war vessel, personally effected the capture of an Arab Dhow with 28 slaves on board. This very creditable enterprise was successfully carried out by Captain Beville, with great promptitude and courage. Captures were also made by H. M. SS. Lapwing and Sphinx. A group of Baluchis of the Batineh, who had for long kidnapped and sold Mekranis into slavery, were nought to account, and after trial before the Political Agent and a representa- live or the Sultan, were punished with imprisonment. • ■^ ra ^ e ^ as shown veiy satisfactory results. In dates there was an increase m le expor o ovei a lakh of dollars in value, compared with the preceding year, notwithstanding gloomy prospects at one time. The figures show a very large increase m the total volume of trade; allowance must, however, be made or a great undervaluation of the arms imported in the year 1895-96, and making a further deduction on account of the movements of specie, there still remains a substantial improvement in the value of trade, of over three lakhs o o ars. n arms, even after the liberal allowance made for undervaluation active PreVl0US year ' it is evident that th e trade has been considerably moreRESIDENCY AND MASKA.T POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 3.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. In July the murder of one of their tribesmen in Eejeyreh caused f?reat resentment among the Kowasimis, and serious trouble was threatened. The excitement was not appeased by the death of one of the offending tribe who had been seized and confined, and the Sheikhs of Shargah, and Rasel Khymah as Kowasimi Chiefs, led an expedition against Eejeyreh. The feud was finally settled by the payment of blood-money to the relatives of the man who had been killed. About the same time a very calamitous fire occurred at Shargah; 400 houses were destroyed, and the loss in property was estimated at $30,000. Fortunately only one life was lost. In November a severe storm caused the wreck of many of the boats of the pearl divers, many of whom perished with their boats. Disastrous fires occurred also at Abu Thabi and Debai. In the first of these, 170 houses were destroyed, but the loss and injury did not end here, for the Beni Yas tribe took advantage of the occasion to plunder the property which the owners contrived to rescue from the flames. At Debai the calamity was of a terrible character, half of that town, together with the whole of Dairah which adjoins it, were reported to have been completely wrecked, and the loss thus caused was very heavy. Owing to failure of rain the date crop around Shargah was very scanty. In the middle of the cold season, the assemblage of a considerable force by the Chief of Abu Thabi, with the alleged object of punishing the Beni Katb and Awamir, caused grave anxiety on the coast and especially at Shargah, where preparations for defence were made. The offending tribes had raided in Abu Thabi territory and killed some of the people, and had then sought shelter in the vicinity of the coast towns about Shargah. Resistance was not, however, offered to the punitive expedition, and the Chief of the Beni Katb readily met the overtures made by Sheikh Zaid of Abu Thabi, and secured peace by engag ing to return the plundered property. These terms having been settled, Sheikh Zaid warned the Beni Katb that the more distant Manasir tribe from Katr, which in the preceding year had threatened the peace of their coast, had also nrepared a punitive expedition against them. With this timely warning and some material assistance from Shargah, the Beni Katb and Awamir were ena e to meet their foes, who in spite of superior numbers were defeated witti some loss in a sharp engagement which ensued. The Manasir were incensed agams Sheikh Zaid, on account of the reverse thus inflicted on an expedition under taken, as they alleged, at his instigation. The balance of the fine noted in last year's report as having been imposed on the Chief of Abu Thabi, in consequence of extensive slave importations which had been allowed to be carried out at that place, was recovere on e occasion of a visit by H. M. S. Sphinx to the coast in June. It was reported that Sheikh Zaid had designs against the life of the Residency Agent on the Pirate Coast, on account of the exposure by the Agent of these slaving operations. The charge was denied, but independent e n q u ' -1 gave it some colour, and the commander of the man -of-war was requested to convey a suitable warning to the Sheikh. In June hostilities were reported between the people o£ Shaam and Rams, both tributarv to Ras-el-Khymah. At the close of the year under report, the Sheikh of Ras -el-Khymah was stated to be seriously ill.8 ADMINISTBATION REPOBT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 3.—BAHREIN. Beyond some not very serious signs of disafTection, which were the natural result of the failure of Sheikh Esa, Chief of Bahrein, to call the Amamireh to account for the act of certain of that tribe in killing Sultan bin Salamah referred to in last year's report, the course of events in Bahrein has been on the whole smooth and peaceful. Ali, son of Sultan bin Salamah, supported by a Bedouin following, tried to incite some of the A1 bin Ali to aid him in reprisals against the Amamireh at the pearl banks. The Chief warned the A] bin Ali against lending themselves to these schemes of vengeance, and the attempt generally failed. A part of the A1 bin Ali, however, sympathizing with feelings of their late Sheikh's son, and dissatisfied at the immunity permitted to those who had caused his death, went over to Katr where they joined Ali at Ghariyeh. They subsequently attacked and plundered a Bahreia boat, carrying off pearls and money amounting to over a thousand rupees. Sheikh Esa wisely refrained from interference with the departure of some A1 bin Ali families who after- wards desired to join the men who had seceded. In November the prospect of scarcity caused the Chief to prohibit the ex port of food-grains. About the same time the restoration of friendly relations with the Katr peninsula was notified, and a proclamation was made in the bazars that traffic with that district might be resumed. 4.—EL-HAS A. A post runner with the Turkish mail from Katif for El-Hasa, was way laid and robbed in April 1896 by a party of the notoriously predatory A1 Murrah tribe. A pursuit by mounted troops from Hasa, resulted in a somewhat curious complication. Before the mounted party could overtake the A1 Murrah, the latter had, in their turn, been attacked and plundered by a party of the Dowasir, and the troops encountering these last, whom they took to be the original robbers, fell upon them. The troops, however, lost two men killed and two wounded in the attack, and the Dowasir retreated with three horses which they captured. 5.—KATIP AND KATR. The appearance of small Turkish war vessels in these waters was rather more frequent and continued than has been usual. One of these arrived in Alay, and was followed by a second. In October the Turkish garrison of El-Bidaa was relieved by 400 troops conveyed there m the Turkish gunboat Zuhaf. e n Tll f .'? em 1 P ursued their habitual course of robbery.

At the opening of the year the Nizam-es-Sultaneh was continued in the Governor -Generalship which he had held, and remained in office until events compelled Ms recall some months later. In June a midnight attack, of a most brutal and murderous character, was committed upon Mr. Tanfield, an employe of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, by a Persian in his service, the final escape of the victim with life, though fearfully mutilated, being almost miraculous. After considerable delay the assailant was carried to Tehran, and there imprisoned. In January of this year a strong mob after pillaging a caravan of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, in transit between the town and river, a few miles distant, attacked and completely sacked the office of Messrs. Hotz in the town. The embargo on the export of wheat, though not officially suspended, remained, as reported at the close of last year, virtually in abeyance. Its enforcement was again notified in July by the Governor-General, only to be followed immediately by an intimation from the Government, through Her Majesty's Legation, of its removal. The harvest gathered in the spring of 1896 was abundant, but prices nevertheless rose after a few months, the average for the year being more than double those for the preceding year, owing mainly to the short crop in Mesopotamia. Prospects for the coming harvest were doubtful, and in January of this year a general piohibition of the export of food-grains was notified, to take effect in March; it was, however, unnoticed by the local authorities on the Kaiun till April. Exceptionally high floods on the Tigris in the spring of 1896 caused a considerable rise of the Karun, and damaged the date crop, of which the yield was consequently poor ; prices were therefore considerably higher than usual. Trade generally was satisfactory, the returns showing a large increase in the total volume over the previous year. 8.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. The supreme and tragic event of the year for Fars, as for Persia in eeneral, was the assassination of the Shah. Within a few days of the celebra tion of the Jubilee of the fiftieth year of his reign, the preparations for which were in a forward state, His Majesty Nasr -ud-Dm Shah was shot on the 1st May at the shrine of Abdul Azim which he was in the habit of visiting, a few miles distant from Tehran. Death followed almost immediately. His Royal Highness Rukn -ed-Dowleh, brother of the late Shah, retained the Governor -Generalship of the Province at the annual spring settlement. In the end of Julv news was received that a new appointment had been made. The new Governor-General, Na Z im -ed-Dowleh, did not, however, reach Shiraz, to assume the charge of the administration, till late in October. The Pars province suffered again from the ravages of locusts, though the direct injury caused by this plague was lessened by the precan ion which appears to have been largely adopted, of substituting the cultivation of barley for that of wheat, as barley ripening earlier than wheat, and before the power for mischief of the insects is fully developed, enjoys immunity from their attacks^ While there was a scarcity of wheat therefore, the barley crop was reported to be The value of the copper ' pul' fell four-fold in smraz, or irom to for the kran. The dislocation of the monetary system thus entailed had to be10 ADMINISTRATION REPOUT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL met by calling in a part of the copper and fixing the rate provisionally at 30 Shahis for the kran. His Eoyal Highness Hissam-es-Sultaneh, who, at the close of the year 1895-96, was appointed to the Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf Ports, proceeded in a very leisurely manner to the seat of his authority, not arriving at Bushire till the middle of June. Complaints were made by the mail steamer agents of extreme difficulty and delay in the discharge of cargo in September, followed by a joint protest by all the British firms against the injury thus suffered. In January the Indo-European Telegraph Station at Reshire, 5 miles from Bushire, was the scene of a serious mob outrage. After some premonitory menaces, a mob consisting of several hundreds, of whom many were armed with guns, rushed to the destruction of the ,bench marks of the recently completed longitude operations, close to the main building. Resistance was out of the question, and the mob, after effectingjthe wreck of these marks, pro ceeded to the tidal observatory by the sea, where they similarly destroyed the tidal level record. The outrage which was instigated by the Syeds was in pur suance of a vulgar superstition, that these record marks had been the cause of the deficient rainfall. At the close of the year the mutilated scientific records were formally replaced. In the early cold weather the appearance of the plague at Bombay neces sitated the adoption of quarantine precautions. The resources of the Persian Government were unequal to the inauguration of efficient measures, and the onus devolved on this Residency. Quarantine was eventually placed on a satisfactory and efficient footing at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerah for which the services of Assistant Surgeons were lent by the Government of India, as well as at Bushire. Kishm Island was visited by a terrible calamity. On the night of the 11th January an earthquake laid the town in ruins, only two musjids and three or four other buildings being left standing. Sixteen hundred bodies were reported to have been recovered from the ruins, besides those of strangers which were not identi fied. Shocks were felt as far as liingah to the west, and on the neighbouring Island of Larak where some loss of life was also reported. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN. At Charbar there was serious and long-continued trouble regarding rival claims to the subsidies paid by the Telegraph Department, in consideration of protection for their land line. The superior provincial authority at Bampur, being itself at one time contested and in doubt, the subordinate local Chiefs who are the recipients of the Telegraph subsidies, were in conflict in regard to the title to the payments as derived from one or other of the contending superiors. The position was by no means an easy one for the Telegraph Superintendent, on whom the rival demands were constantly pressed. The matter was shortly afterwards settled for the time, by payment for the half-year up to June 1896, being made to Mohamed Khan, one of the claimants, whose title seemed to be the most in orde^ In February of 1897 there was a recrudes- cence of the same dispute, and it was necessary, in order to avoid the risk of mischief, to make the next payment to another candidate, who appeared to have substantial support. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. An increased activity in the slave trade has already been commented upon above. rKESIDENCT AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE TEAR 1896-97 Several minor slave transactions of a local and unimportant character came to light. In one of these a small party of Baluch slaves, for the most part hoys, who had probably been kidnapped, were shipped at Wadam on the Batineh Coast, a place of evil repute in this connection—for Lingah. An adult of the party there made his escape, and the remainder were carried to Dehay, where two more after escaping fell into the hands of the Arabs of Khan, a dependency of Shargah. These were recovered and sent to Maskat, where on the clue furnished by Feroz's evidence proceedings were taken result ing in the conviction of a large number of slave dealers. An attempt at re-enslavement of a liberated slave on the Persian coast was reported, he was recovered after some months at Lingah, and handed over to the Commander of H. M. S, Sphinx. Six slaves who, after effecting their escape from Shargah, had managed to reach the Telegraph Station at Jask, were brought to Bushire, and being there liberated were conveyed to Maskat at their own desire. A more serious case was the kidnapping of 17 men on the South Arabian Coast, by an armed party of the Yal Saad, who carried them by boat to the Batineh Coast, and thence sent them by land to the Pirate Coast or the in terior. This act was committed in February 1896, but the facts did not come to light till the beginning of the year under report, on the information of one of the slaves who had escaped. The Sheikh of the Yal Saad who was directly implicated was imprisoned by the Sultan, and later died in confinement. Only one other of the party was traced in the possession of the Bedouin, and as it was impossible to obtain his freedom without ransom, the disbursement of the sum required was sanctioned by Government. 11.—PIRACY. Some piracies were committed by the Beni Hajar robber tribe in Bahrein waters. Vigorous action for the suppression of piracy at the mouth of the Shat-el* Arab was pressed on the Turkish and Persian authorities jointly by the British Consular authorities at Busreh and Mohammerah at the urgent instance of the British Officers, both sides, while still maintaining each that the liabi lity rested on the other, agreed to adopt measures of prevention, by appointing posts along the river, where vessels should anchor at night under adequate protection, and by arranging for the nightly patrol of the river by armed boats. A visit of inspection to certain of these posts was made by the British Consuls, in company with Sheikh Mizzal, the Perso-Arab Governor of Mohammerah. The effect of these measures was very satisfactory, and the British Indian boats visiting the river for their usual cargo of dates in autumn enjoyed immunity from the danger to which they had previously been exposed. In April of 1896 a bold piracy was committed on a boat from Koweit, off the mouth of the river, the Nakhuda being killed, two traders wounded, and some 3,000 rupees worth of goods and cash being plundered. 13.—ROYAL NAVY. H. M. S. Lapwing was on the Persian Gulf station at the opening of the year under report, and was relieved in May by H. M. S. Sphinx, In the autumn H. M. S. Lapwing was stationed in the Shat-el-Arab, and was later relieved by H. M. S. Redbreast, which finally left the Gulf at the close of the official year. 13.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. There was no change in the personnel of the Residency during the year.12 ADMINISTRATION BEPOUT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Lieutenant C. Ducat, First Assistant to the Resident, was absent on two months' privilege leave, from the 14th November, his duties being conducted by Mr. J. C.

The past year was one of considerable importance to the Sultan, death by violence having removed the bitterest Political. . ,, i opponent the rulers or Maskat have had for the past 25 years. Since the imposition of the punitive tax upon the Hinawi in August 1895, Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali al Harthi had used his best endeavours to turn this circumstance to account. In May 1898, Saleh found his opportunity. The Sultan, partly with a view to carrying out the wishes of the Government of India in regard to the completion of the indemnity to British subjects for losses incurred, within the period fixed, and which he considered impossible upon the basis originally decided upon, and also partly with a view to reple nishing his empty exchequer, decided to impose a tax upon the produce of the Ghafiris as well as upon that already imposed upon the rebel Hinawi. Saleh at once seized the opportunity thus offered him and effected a coalition between the Beni Ruaheh (Hinawi) and a portion of the Beni Jabir (Ghafiri), and proceeded to attack Seja which was held by the Beni Hadram and by such of the Jabir as remained faithful to His Highness the Sultan. Saleh himself, though upwards of 75 years of age, assumed command of the allied tribes. During one of the petty skirmishes that ensued, a stray bullet deprived the rebels of their leader, and ended the life of the bitterest and the most able opponent of the ruling house. Had the Sultan at once seized the opportunity the death of this famous leader gave him, and attacked the rebels, there seems to be no doubt but that he would have been successful. Saleh was killed early in September, and it was not until late in October that the Sultan with a force of about 7,000 men left for the interior. As soon as the Sultan heard of the opposition that would be raised against the increase in taxation, he cancelled the orders imposing a tax upon the produce of the Ghafiris, and he thus was able to detach the Beni Jabir from the coalition consisting principally of the Beni Ruaheh. The long delay that took place prior to a start enabled the Beni Ruaheh to overcome their first panic at the loss of their leader, and they were accordingly in a position to oppose the Sultan's advance. The difference between the opposing forces was that the Beni Ruaheh were fighting for their homes, whereas the Sultan's troops were mercenaries, who like most Omani Arabs show extreme valour so long as they receive their pay and are not within striking distance of the enemy. As a natural result of relying only upon such troops, the Sultan at the critical moment was deserted by most of the Sheikhs who had, though really friendly to the enemy, professed allegiance to His Highness, and he returned to Maskat, without having accomplished anything beyond the expenditure of about $60,000. Owing to a dispute between two factions in Nakhl, there appeared to be fears of an outbreak in that district in the month of June. The Sultan accompanied by a few hundred men proceeded to the place and was able to restore order without further trouble. With the above exceptions, and the usual petty intertribal disputes which appear to be a necessity of existence in Oman, the country was not in a disturbed state during the year under report. At the close of the previous year, the Sultan's rule had ceased in Dhofar, although the Shanafareh were favourable Dhofar. t0 llim ° and Merbat was still garrisoned by His Highness' men.14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL In the month of January of the present year, the Sultan, having decided to attempt to regain possession of his lost province, solicited the assistance of a British vessel^of war with a view to enable him to carry out his design. Government having agreed conditionally to this request, the Political Resident, together with His Highness Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Turki and Seyyid Hamed bin-Nasir, left for Dhofar in the Indian Government vessel Lawrence, H M. S. Cossack which had been placed at the disposal of Government for the purpose also proceeded to Dhofar. The Sultan's troops numbering about 400 men advanced to Hafa inhabited by the friendly Shanafareh, and after parleying with the rebels for some days, Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Turki, acting upon the advice of Colonel Wilson, accepted the submission of the A1 Kathir upon the terms offered, and the flags which the rebels had hoisted were hauled down, and various forts in their possession were handed over to the Sultan's troops. Seyyid Hamed-bin-Nasir was left as Governor temporarily until Sheikh Suleiman-bin-Suweilim, the Sultan's nominee, arrived. Without recourse to absolute force the Sultan thus regained one of his outlying provinces which had been in a state of rebellion for some eighteen months. The proceeds of this tax, which His Highness imposed upon those tribes responsible for the losses incurred by Punitive Tax on tbe Rebel tubes. British and other foreign subjects during the rebellion in 1895, has not, for various causes, reached the estimate which was originally formed. During the past year a sum of about $20,000, repre senting 20 months* collection, was paid to the Consulate for distribution amongst the claimants. With a view to obtaining better results the contract for the collection of the tax has been farmed out for a sum of $15,000 per annum, and it appears therefore that a period of five years will be requisite since its first imposition for the proceeds of the tax to meet all claims. The Political Resident visited Maskat in January in order to discuss various questions with the Sultan. He General again visited Maskat in March upon the occasion of the Dhofar expedition. Owing to the prevalence of the plague in Bombay and Karachi, His High- ness decided to impose a quarantine of nine days against these ports. Up to the time of writing this measure has had the effect of keeping the disease out of the country. Maskat was visited during the year under report by Her Majesty's ships , T Brisk, Lapwing, Sphinx, Redbreast and Cossack. Foreign navies were represented by the French gunboat Surprise. In the month of May, there being no vessel of war upon the station, the siave Trade Political Agent had to personally seize a slave vessel with 28 slaves on board when some little distance off Maskat. A few days afterwards, H. M. S. Lapwing arrived and within a few T hours of her arrival was enabled to seize a slave vessel with 14 slaves on board. Three days after the first capture, above noted, a further capture of a vessel with two row-slaves was made by the Sultan at Jisser, upon information given to His Highness by the Consulate. In September of the year under report, H. M. S. Sphinx brought in two vessels flying French colours, for the purpose of verification of their colours by the French Consulate here. The right of the vessels to their colours was found to be correct, but upon examination by the French authority, the vessels were found to have about 175 slaves on board, and were accordingly detained.EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1896-97. 15 After carrying on their trade for several years, a gang of Baluchis resident in the Batineh, who were in the habit of kidnapping Mekrani Baluchis and selling them as slaves on the Pirate Coast, were seized in December. A Court consisting of Seyyid Badr-bin-Seif, on behalf of the Sultan, and the Political Agent, tried the accused upon 34 charges of slave dealing. The accused with one exception were found guilty, and the Sultan gave them various terms of imprisonment and also imposed fines upon them. During the year under report, 74 fugitive slaves took refuge in the Con sulate. Of these, 70 were liberated and 4 dismissed not being entitled to free dom under the stipulations of the Treaty of 1873.

The total trade of Maskat for the year 1896-97 is returned at $4,788,800 against $3,708,210 of the previous year, making an increase for the year of $1,080,590. Of this increase, however, a sum of at least $450,000 must be deducted as the under-estimated price of arms and ammunition imported in the year 1895-96, It is to the advantage of the Customs authorities to under-estimate the returns of imports, as the customs are farmed. In the present year, how ever, iDdependent information has been obtained as to the quantities of arms and ammunition imported, and hence the necessary correction in the figures of the year previous. The total increase of trade for the year 1896-97 may, there fore, be estimated at $630,590. Of this gain, imports are responsible for $141,000 and exports for $490,000. The imports, however, exceed the exports by $970,200, and it would appear, therefore, that the balance of trade is against the country to this extent. This, however, is not the case, for, owing to its situation, Maskat serves as the port of entry for certain goods, arms in particular, which are destined for the Arab Coast and other parts of the Persian Gulf. Of the eight lakhs worth of arms which arrived during the past year, at least six lakhs were for other countries, which have not proper facilities for importing arms direct. The payment of these arms is made in direct export from these places, as a reference to the Bushire Residency Returns for the Arab Coast will show. In addition to the above, about a lakh and a half worth of rice and piece goods, etc., are also re-exported to these places, and hence of the deficit of $970,000, about $750,000 have been accounted for. The balance remaining appears to be the deficit against the country, which from the returns appears to be made up in specie payments. Of the total increase of $630,000 shown, imports give a net gain of $141,000, made up as follows :— Increase, Arms . , Cereals . Oils Ghee , Piece goods .

Abstract of Contents, Agriculture. Miscellaneous. Bundar Nasri. Statistics. General. There lias been a general increase in trade and rise in prices owing to good crops and increase of population by immigration. Conditions of Trade.—One of the chief difficulties connected with trade on the Karun is the necessity of giving large advances to the cultivators before the prospects of the harvest are assured. The buyers practically have to act as bankers to the cultivatois goods imported are usually sold on three or six months credit and paid for in instalments. Jftxcharigp. —Exchange averaged about 51 krans to the £1. Exports. Wheat.— shipments shew a slight falling off, only about 2,000 tons of the 1895 crop being shipped in the first quarter, which is the principal season for wheat export, owing to the embargo, only partially removed in January, having prevented large purchases. A large quantity of wheat has gone direct from the fields by lighter to Mesopotamia where crops were short, only returns of that shipped at Bundar Nasri are obtainable. Gum. —The increase in gum is due to new districts being tapped from Bundar Nasri. Beans. —Beans for the first time were shipped to London (112 tons). Imports. Sugar. —There was a large increase in the import of beet sugar, principally French; this is bought by Native merchants in large quantities and is forwarded by them to some extent to other provinces. Fiece-goods* —The principal cotton goods and local prices of same are as follows :— Market rates. 81b. grey shirting, 4«. 11^. per piece of 38 yards. 91b. „ „ 5*. 10R „ „ 38 „ White „ 9s. 9|^. „ „ 40 ,, „ „ dyed in India, 35. per piece of 10 yards. Manchester prints, 20^. to 30s. per piece of 80 yards. Indian „ 8s. per piece o£ 44 yards. The tables of Karun trade shew all cargo carried ; in previous years returns of local cargo by Persian boat were not obtainable. General. Exports. Imports.

Lynch Brothers have now made arrangements for the insurance of cargo in transit between Europe and Ispahan via Bundar Nasri and the Baktiari hills : this covers all risks including robbery. If this road be improved, there should be a great future before it. Caravan rate. —Hates, caravan, Bundar Nasri or Shushter to Ispahan, 15s. to 20s. per load of 350ft). A griculture. Wheat, —The wheat crop was unusually good, and, owing to increased competition and scarcity in Mesopotamia, reached a higher price than heretofore, rising from 3s. Gd. to 6s. 4^. per cwt. The prospects for next harvest are bad owing to very little rain having fallen. Oilseeds. —The oilseeds crop was below the average in quantity, owing to fear of disturbances at the time of sowing consequent on the Shah's death. Dates. —The date crop was below the average owing to floods in the spring, damaging the crop. Prices were unusually high, 5s. lOc?. to 7s. lOc?. per 160ib. The rice crop of Hawaizeh, Lizful, and Ram Hormuz was large and of good quality. M iscellaneous, Tovulation. population of Mohammerah has increased considerably. IleaIth. —There were no epidemics. Cattle disease which was prevalent in 1895 gradually died out in February. B undar N asri. At Bundar Nasri the population has increased considerably, building is still going on. A large new bazar has been completed, a wool press erected in June, and another larger one was imported in December. Opposite at Eminieh stores were erected with a view to caravan trade with Dizful, an important centre, but owing to tribal conflicts the road was unsafe. At Ithlah below Nasri a bazar has been built, and the town re-named Mazafferiah. W. McDOUALL, jET. 23.
