In these sequences some of the pages have been paginated, meaning that some numbers in the sequence are missing. The most complete of these foliation sequences, which is the first one, has been extended to provide a complete sequence. It is circled in pencil in the top right corner of the recto of each folio, and runs from 1 to 258, ending on the inside of the back cover of the file. This is the sequence that should be used for referencing.
