In September, 1922, Raja Mohamed Khushalbai, of Ahmedabad (Bombay Presidency) made an offer, through the High Commission, of Rs.25,000/-, for the provision of an electric light system at Kerbala. The money was actually received in November, 1922. Independently of this offer, the concession for the supply of electric light in Kerbala was obtained by an association of curious composition, with aims partly commercial and partly benevolent; and it was decided to devote Raja Mohamed Khushalbai’s donation to the provision of electrical equipment in the Shrines of Abbas and Hussein. Nothing was settled as to payment of the cost of current consumed, and certain R.M.K. did not contemplate an endowment in perpetuity; no one else had any ideas on the subject: and for some reason, not at present apparent, the Shrines have drawn, and continue to draw, free current, to the detriment of the concessionaires. The net amount received from India was Es. 24,996/14/- (November, 1922). This sum was transferred, in April, 1925, to the Examiner of Irrigation and Public V?orks ('Irag Government), the Ministry of Communications and Public Works having undertaken to carry out the necessary work and to submit a statement of the expenditure incurred in due course up to January 5, 1929, the Ministry had expended Es. 25,524/7/-, and they then reoue..ted the High Commissioner to take over the balance of Es. 1,472/7/- as it was contrary to regulations for them to hold sums on deposit for long periods. They suggested that the balance should be held by the High Commissioner against the cost of possible future repairs to the installation.
