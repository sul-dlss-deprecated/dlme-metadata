S, B, Copy of a letter from the Adjutant General in India, to the Lieutenant-Generals Commanding, No. 654-A., ' Officers—Discipline dated Fort William, the 17th March 1904. It has come to the notice of the Commander-in- Chief that notwithstanding the very clear and precise orders which have from time to time been issued to ensure the secrecy of documents, there have been instances recently where the most reprehensible laxity has been shown in the observance of thosa orders. 2. This laxity can obviously only have arisen from a want of adequate appreciation of the re sponsibility resting upon those to whose care these important secret documents have been entrusred. and in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future as to the serious nature of these re sponsibilities, the Commander-in-Chief wishes all concerned to be informed that he intends to take the severest notice of any future neglect of the orders. 3. Under His Excellency's directions a copy of this letter will be attached to all documents, the secret nature of which may necessitate thoir beini,' issued for the personal information of those con cerned. HSECRET. PLAN OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SUPPORT OF MUHAMMAREH. 'J his plan has been compiled at Army Headquarters, in the light of the latest information available, with the approval of His Excellency the Commander-in- Chief. While the action recommended is that which is considered the most likely to achieve the desired end, it is to be clearly understood that it is not intended to fetter the discretion of the Officer appointed to command the force as to the action, which, subsequent to the concentration of the forces placed at his dis posal, he may consider, in accordance with the circumstances of the moment best calculated to carry the intentions of Government into effect. SECTION I.—I nformation. Lower Mesopotamia with special reference to Basrah. Reference Maps. —Map of Lower Mesopotamia l // =32 miles. Degree Sheets No. 3 N, 10 Band IOC. 1. The area from the Persian Gulf to Qurnah is quite flat. It may be ^ divided into :— (o) The Shatt-al-Arab rw.—Navigable to Basrah, and to Gurmat AH, 10 miles up-stream from Basrah, where the new channel of the Euphrates joins in, by all ships which can cross the bar at the mouth of the river. (Maximum draught 22 feet at high tide. At low water 13 feet.) Mean breadth about 600 yards as far south as Muhammareh : thence it expands from about J mile to 1 mile. The banks are low, and in places the river has to be kept out, at high water, by dykes! The river is Turkish, Persia having certain treaty rights of navigation. (6) The eastern or left hank of the mer.—(From the south towards Basrah) (i) Abbadan island. Mostly desert, but the margins adjoining the rivers are cultivated. There are many creeks and some marshes. The refining works of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are on the island, facing the &amp;hatt-al-Arab, about 8 miles below Muhammareh. Abbadan Island is bounded on the east by the Bahmanshir Biver, formerly the main channel of the Karun. Navigation of this channel is impeded by a mud bar, with 8 feet of water, 10 miles seaward from the mouth of the river. Vessels drawing 7 feet can navigate the river for 30 miles up. Thereafter, the northern part of the ri\ or, foi about lo miles, is very shallow i the R. I. M. S. ' Comet drawm* 7 3 feet, grounded twice in steaming up it in 1890. (ii) Part of the Muhammareh district; and part of the Basrah Qadha. llie margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from J to 2 miles. East of the date-groves is a fiat low-lying alluvial plain, fairly well watered, and consisting to a great extent of grass or cultivable land. Infantry could march from Muhammareh to a point opposite Basrah by keeping 2 or 3 miles inland from the bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. Two streams and several muddy creeks would have to be crossed. (c) The right or western hank. —The margin of the river is covered by a prac tically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from 2 to 2 miles. There are some deep muddy creeks, some of which extend inland for a considerable distance from the river Shatt-al-Arab. There is a ten-foot tide in the lower Shatt-al-Arab, which fills these creeks and probably any inland marshes, but exact information re garding these marshes is not available,. West of the date-groves, S163WGSB 6r the country is partly open desert and partly marshy as far as the Khur Zubair, an arm of the sea which runs up from Warba island, northwards, and nearly parallel to the Shatt-al-Arab, at a distance of 25 to 30 miles from it. The country between the river Shatt-al- Arab and the Khur Zubair is believed to be not very suitable for the movement of troops, except along one good track, which runs ™ ^ xt * t &gt; . t a ^ on g tlie e(i g e ^ tiie desert, IWd Note., Route I. page 67. immediately behind the fringe of date-groves. 'West of the Khur Zubair again there is open desert, the going over which is reported to be firm and good. The northern part of the Khur is surrounded partly by a marshv plain, much intersected by creeks, and partly by an alluvial plain which is liable to inundation. (d) North of Basrah, up to and beyond Qurnah, nearly the whole country is marshy, liable to inundation, and quite unsuitable for the move ment of troops. There are, however, several tracks through these shallow marshes, by which local Arabs, on foot and lightly equipped, could find their way down to Basrah unaccompanied by transport. Lines ol Advance 2. To reach Basrah, the following are possible lines of advance :— G^i on he BMrah. ian W By r ^ ver to Basrah.—This line of advance is the most convenient, but its use depends on mastery of the Shatt-al-Arab and its banks. (n) Prom Fao, along the edge of the desert parallel to the Shatt-al-Arab.—This Field Notes, Route I, page 67. route, 67 miles in 4 stages, has drawbacks— (а) scarcity of water, fuel and fodder; (б) possible inundation at times; (c) the presence of date-groves along the flank of a movement by it. (in) From Vmm Qasr.~~This, the shortest land route, 47 miles in 3 stages. Field Notes ^ ^aid to ha\ e • ample water supply, except possibly at Umm Qasr. But accurate information regarding the water supply is lacking. If a landing at Umm Qasr is feasible, this should prove the shortest and best land route to Basrah. There are no local boats at Umm Qasr. (tr) From Kuwait. —The desert detour by this route rules it out. 3. Supplies —Reports indicate that for operations in this region all first Field Notes, pages 24-27. requirements should be sent from India, except meat, which can be obtained from Muhammareh. Telegraphs. 4. Telegraphic communications are :— (i) British cable from India, via Bushire, landed at Fao. (ii) Turkish line Fao-Basrah along bank of river Tigris to Baghdad- / Musal-Constantinople. Branch line from Qurnah via Euphrates valley to Baghdad. {in) Line Baghdad-Kirmanshah-Tehran. {iv) Persian line, Muhammareh-Ahwaz-Behbehan-Bushire. There is a telephone line from Abbadan island to Maidan -i-Naftun. with a branch to Muhammareh. Climate - 5. Between October and March is the Field Notes, pages 17-19. most suitable time for military operations. 6. Naval strength.—The only Turkish warship in the Shatt-al-Arab is the Field Notes, page 45. ''Marmaris ', a gunboat of about 420 tons. • .. , _ x , ^he was completed in 1907 and is armed with four 9-prs., two 1-prs., and a torpedo tube above water.0 In April 1914 four patrol boats, one of wood and three of iron, of a gross tonnage of 30 to 33 tons each, reached Basrah. Each boat carried two 37 m. m. guns. Other vessels are :— ' Converted cargo steamer, one gun. ' Alous '.—Two guns. ' Kilid-ul-Bahar'\g\m\)0&amp;t, since used as a lightship. It used to have 4 Krupp guns. ' 'Prat ' and ' Resafa ', steamers protected with iron plates, probably against attack by Arabs on the river. To carry two ordinary guns and two machine guns. ' Brinji ' and ' IJdnii launches, to be armed with 2 Q. F. guns (1910). No information has been received that this has been done. 7. Militany strength. —The regular troops in Mesopotamia are estimated at Field Notes, pages 31-38. about 10 ' 000 men ' , in cludi]lg 1,200 Sabres, with 114 guns and 6 machine guns. In clusion of reservists is unlikely to raise the number to more than 15,000 men. Of these it is thought not more than 8,000 rifles, 500 sabres, 58 guns and 6 machine guns could be concentrated at Basrah. In the early part of September 1914 reliable ^ u reports stated that about 3,000 rifles, with 6 guns, were at, or in the vicinity of, Basrah. None of the troops in Mesopotamia are well trained. The infantry are hardy, and are good natural soldiers. They are armed with Mauser rifles of two or three different patterns. The artillery is still mostly equipped with old pattern guns. The only Q. F. guns reported are one mountain battery of 4 guns at Baghdad and one of 4 guns at Musal (July 1912). The ca\alry regiments are not well mounted and are barely a match for the local Arab mounted tribesmen. Possible reinforcements. —The Turkish IXth, Xth, and Xlth Army Corps are sta tioned at Erzerum, Ersinjan, and Van respectively. Owing to the Russian menace on the Caucasian frontier, and the attitude of Kurds and Armenians, it is un likely that any of these corps could be scared to assist in Mesopotamia. The Xth Army Corps at Ersinjan has three divisions, located, two at Ersinjan and one at Siwas. The other two corps only have two divisions each. Nothing is known of the military qualities of the leaders mentioned in ' Field Notes on Lower Mesopotamia', page 79. 8. At Fao, about 3j miles south-east of the telegraph station, there is an Land defenoet incomplete, blunted redan, of stone, facing south-east and commanding the bar between the Peisian and approaches. This fort would have to be taken before the river could be used ,u au asia as a line of advance. Field Notes, page, 38.39. At U ' nI ' Q aSr t liere , is i a Sma11 . nearl y square fort, % mile inland. At Safwan there is usually a Turkish post with a garrison of 30 infantry. No details of any fort are available, but there is probably a small mud one. At Zubair there appear to be some good artillery and defensive positions, and a detachment of about 30 Turkish infantry is usually located there. At Basrah there are some earthworks of low relief on the river bank, on a spit of land between the British Consulate and the mouth of the Ashar creek, where field artillery guns are sometimes placed in position. 9. Of the Arab tribes in Mesopotamia, the largest and most powerful is the mL , . A t . Muntafik. No estimate of its numbers The local Arabs of Mesopotamia. • *11,1 u - lj . i* a - i ii ^ is available, but at one time they had 1,500 men in rebellion against the Turks. Shaikh Sa'dun, the late chief of the Muntafik, collected in 1910 against the Kuwait forces, from his own followers and other tribes, some 4,000 horsemen and a large number of dismounted m^ n (no num bers given), but no riding camels. The Muntafik are well armed with rifles, chiefly Martinis. They are reported to have been rebellious against the Turkish Govern-4 ment for some ten years. The Bani Lam tribe is also repo: ted usually hostile towards the Turks. The numbers of the tribesmen in the Basrah vilayat cannot be gauged with any accuracy. The}- are mostly armed with Martini-Henry rifles, with a sprinkl ing of Mausers. For several years the Arabs have been very friendly towards the B itish, and on several occasions prominent chiefs have come forward with suggestions of a British protectorate. The Arabs of Basrah and the neighbourhood appear to be usually ill-disposed torwards the Turks. important Jocal 10. The Shaikh of Muhammareh in 1911-12 and again in 1912-13 raised a force of between 5.000 and 10,000 Arabs for offensive operations. His interests are bound up with ours. The Shaikh of Kuwait could probably raise about 16,000 armed men, of whom about 4,000 would be mounted on camels. Other important personages are mentioned in ' Field Notes on Lower Meso potamia the most prominent being Abdul Aziz bin Saud, Wahabi Shaikh of Na jd. He was reported lately to be displaying pro-Turkish sympathies, but on 24th September 1914 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf did not consider this report correct. Saiyid Talib Bey, Deputy of Basrah, has great influence among the local Arabs. chiefs. 11.
