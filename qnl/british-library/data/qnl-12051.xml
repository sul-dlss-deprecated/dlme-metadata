Two miles later the tracK is difficult for about 50 yards over rocks. At about 10 miles the nulla opens out considerably and the track continues to ascend. A water shed is crossed at 13 miles and the track descends gently into an undulating plain on which the stage ends near a mud fort with two towers. Camping ground is south of fort. Water is from a qanat 300 yards w'est of front. 3 TULBARGAH .. 11m. Road, which is well marked, leaves Sar-i-Ran 42 m . in a N.-N.-W. direction and the going is level amfgood all the way up a broad valley. At 5 miles a ruined tower is passed to the left of the road ; at 7 miles a fort and a few houses and abundant water are passed. The road continues along the valley in a northerly direction (near the hills to the west) to 9 miles where the fort at luibargah is sighted on a small knoll. The fort and village are reached at 11 miles. Water plentiful 100 yds. short of village. 4 BAZARGAN ~ II m. Road, which could easily be made passable 53 for light motors, leaves Tulbargah in a N.-W. direction proceeding up the valley. ^ At 2| miles the track appears to fork—the right branch being taken. At 6 miles the track leads due W. at 9 miles a prominent rock is passed on the left side of the road ; at 10^ miles the tiack turns in a southerly direction up a short nulla reaching the c amping ground at 11 miles. Water on S. edge of camp. 5 BUZDUN .. 81 m. Track leaves camping ground in a northerly gpi direction, the road being struck 500 yds. down the hill. The road leads off almost due W. over undulating country covered with scrub and small trees, rising gradually as it nears the hills. At about two miles the3 Route No. 7-A.— contd. track crosses and then follows the bed of a shallow nulla to 4 miles where hills are entered. There is a moderately steep ascent up a nulla to a low pass whose summit is reached at about 6 miles where a view of an extensive plain is obtained. The track proceeds through scrub to descend gradually on to the plain. At 7|- miles a path leads off to the right in a northerly direction up a ravine. At 8 J- miles the camping ground is reach ed j ust beyond a spring. Firewood plentiful. 6 TALHALAL 13J m. Track leads off S.-W- 1 5 m. ground from camping down the ravine and at 1 k miles joins the road which leads off in a westerly direction across the plain sweeping in a wide curve to the south. At 5 miles a white ziarat is sighted in the distance. In dry weather t he roacl may be left and troops can march direct on the ziarat which is reached at I2J miles (or 13 J miles by road). The village and camping ground are just beyond the shrine. )! ater near village. AZ1REH 87 m. 12 m. Road leaves village of Talhalar in a westerly direction skirting the edge^of the plain. It is stony, and there is a direct track leading off 17.-W. which is passable for troops and loaded camels and mules in dry weather. The going is good save for a few hundred yards of thicket at 7 miles. A small advance party could easily improve the path if provided with bill hooks. At 6 miles the village of Vazireh is sighted and can be made for direct across country. It is reached at 10 miles by direct route, 12 miles by Water close to village. 8 QATRU • • 16 m, Road leaves village of Vazireh in a westerly ^_ direction, proceeding about 2 miles distant from, and parallel to, the hills to the sou thern side of the plain The going is good all the way, and the gardens of Qatm can be sighted from Vazireh.

Epitome. —A. As far as Lar, this is the normal route for cara vans travelling between that city and Bandar Abbas: between Lar and Shiraz the route that is practically always more used lies vid Jahrum—this being both easier and shorter than by Fasa. It is noteworthy that there is practically no caravan traffic between Bander Abbas and Shiraz, although, between the former city and Lar, and between Lar and Shiraz, there is consi derable traffic, between the former two places from about Oct ober to June and between the latter places all the year round. B. Speaking generally, the route is passable throughout for pack animals (camels, donkeys, and mules) without much diffi culty, the majority of the gradients encountered are easy, but the road in its present state is impassable for wheeled traffic owing to obstacles enumerated below. 287GSB6 Route No. 29—contd. m 0. From a military point of view, the employment of this route for moving bodies of troops of any size, even during the period October to April, is not to be recommended for the fol lowing reasons :—- (1) Water .—From Bandar Abbas as far as Mansurabad (15 stages) travellers are entirely dependent for their water supply at the various stages on water from cisterns (Ab-i-Ambar). During the months May to October, nearly all these cisterns are liable to become quite dry; even during the other months of the year, as the rainfall is by no means reliable, there is apt to be a shortage of water for caravans of any size. During May 1917 (after a fair rainfall in the district) the contents of several of the cisterns barely sufHced for a caravan of some 300 camels and 300 donkeys, and their drivers. By June 1917, nearly ail the cisterns were quite dry. Note .—From Mansurabad to Shiraz, water is plentiful from perennial streams and qanats. / (2) Supplies .-—After leaving Bandar Abbas until Lar is reached at no stage whatever en route are supplies available in any quantity. No villages are met with, the stages are marked by cisterns and serais, the country lying on either side of the road for some little distance mav be taken as uninhabited, if the hamlets at Hormuz (8 stages out) be excepted, where only a small amount of supplies could be obtained, a negligible quan tity in fact. Thus troops moving inland from Bandar Abbas would have to be entirely self-contained as regards supplies ; this would necessarily increase the amount of transport required (in propor tion to the size of the force) and thus add materially to the diffi culty of adequate water supply. Beyond Lar, as far as Qutbabad (18th stages) similar diffi culties would be met with, though in a minor degree. The supplies obtainable at the intervening stages would be insuffi cient for any body of troops larger than a section, arrangements would have to be made for laying in supplies from Lar. Note .—From Qutbabad to Shiraz supplies could be procured in very fair quantities ; due notice would have to be given before hand.c l 7 Eoute Xo. 29— contd. (3) Fodder .—The remarks under the heading “ Supplies ” may be taken as being equally applicable to 44 Fodder.’ 5 (4) Climatic conditions .—From May till about the end of September, a march over that part of the route lying between Far and the coast would be unduly trying for troops, owing to the severe heat. Even marching by night and resting during the day would not adequately overcome this difficulty. During May 1917, the heat during the day, even in a double fly tent, was trying, and there is no shade to speak of for troops between the coast and Lar at the various stages. D. Other features of the route. (1) Fuel .—With one or two exceptions, necessitating carry ing firewood from one stage to another, fuel is obtainable throughout the journey in ample quantities. (2) Grazing .—Plentiful during the spring and winter months; rather scanty at some stages during the summer, animals have to be driven some miles from the halting places. (3) Camping Grounds. —Ample space at every stage. 5. Obstacles encountered making road impassable for wheeled traffic. (1) 2nd stage .— 44 Gardan ^ of sandstone ledges, and narrow defile through low hills, in parts only passable for infantry in single file. (2) 5th and 6th stages .—Stony throughout, requiring much clearing of large boulders. (3) 7 th stage .—Pa Ian pass. Loose boulders. (4) 9ih stage. —Garclan-i-Buzan. Very narrow track in parts, large loor boulders scattered about. (5) 11th sta ^e.—Slight dip in ground, minor clearing of stone lying on track. (6) 12th Gardan-i-Narangi.—Very steep, rough des cent, difficult for pack animals. Riding impossible. Track very narrow, in places walled up. Large boulders. Very diffi cult to clear effectually for wheels. (7) 14th stage .—Ridge about f mile. Track very narrowj boulders lying about.8 Route No. 29— contd. (8) 16th stage.—The most difficult stage of the whole journey. There are two alternative routes at the start, both equally im passable for wheels; these are :—via I, The Tang-i-Kalun pass ; II, the Gardan-i-Muhammad Ibrahim Khan. I. Very deep, narrow gorge, very stony. Impassable in wet weather. Trying for pack animals at all times. ]\eeds &lt;c gallery ” work to make it passable for wheels. II. Very rough track, zigzaging up over 2 miles of ridge, narrow and covered with large, loose boulders. Difficult in parts even for mules. Of the two, perhaps the track over the u Gardan is pre ferable. The last 4 miles of this stage also are impassable for wheels owing to the large, loose boulders, and the absence of any well- defined track. (9) 17th stage .—Large boulders, clefts in rock, bad going through stony hills. No. of stage and total dis tance. Details. 1 BIRKEH BAND- 12|m. Level track through- I-ALL out, passable for wheeled 12J m. traffic. At this time greater part of road surface consisted of hard beaten sand. No obstacles of any sort encountered en route, wheeled transport could follow track throughout with only a few minor detours. Last fth of mile (after crossing dry river bed) track is a little rough composed of sandstone ruts, ground rising and falling slightly. Track lies along an open plain dotted here and there with small palm clumps. It lies parallel to Clarence Strait and passes here and there within a few yards of the water’s edge. Camping ground is a level expanse, some hundreds of yards broad, dotted wih scrub. Soil is soft sand. Bounded to S. by sea, to N. by low foothills. Birewood ; plentiful but scattered. Water from a large “ pukka ” circular cistern with9 Route No. 2%—contd. 3| ft of water in it at this time. Cistern is domed.

Leaving cistern of *—- Band-i-Ali road crosses 23 m. a low ridge in N.-W. direction, immediately to N. of camping ground, for a distance of about 150 yards. Track over this ridge is rough, the sandstone being worn into ruts. Could be passed by wheeled traffic with little minor clearing. Track then descends into a valley, flat, and varying from 400 yards to 800 yards broad. Date groves on left. Surface of track very hard and level. Turning N. for a few yards track then enters another broad valley, and runs due W. all the way. One or two minor obstacles, low embankments made for cultivation purposes, are met; these could easily be cleared. Valley broadens out into a level plain, on which is the Birkeh-i-Chi stanch, a dumping ground for cara vans, with a ruined caravanserai adjoining cistern. Water in cistern was foul and brackish and scanty. For about another 1-| miles road is level and hard surfaced, running over plain, till it encounters the first serious obstacle, in stage of a “ gardan ” of easy gradient, but composed of ledges of sandstone. No detour to N. or S. is possible. There is a climb of about 50 yards to SO yards over this slope which would effectively check wheeled traffic though possibly Field Artillery might he able to pass it. Beyond this ridge path winds through low hills get ting gradually narrower and narrower and rougher in character, until it eventually becomes in places too narrow for infantry in fours or even in file. Here it becomes a track through a wind ing defile, quite impassable for wheeled traffic though more or loss level, and quite practicable for animals. Debouching from the defile track enters a valley broadening out gradually. After traversing the valley for about mile Birkeh-i-Mirza or Ambar- i-Mirza is reached, which is on top of a little knoll, immediately 287GSB10 Route No. 29—contd. ° f p!r k ^ d abou ^ 3 “ iles ^ort (E.) of caravanserai N. oi liacnm i&gt;ala (the usual stage from Birkeh-i-Ali). and^hiV^r 6 18 0bta fr d / r ° m an ° pen cistern - S °me 30' across w d ^ Ch f haS f de P. tb of font 2| feet of water at this time. hills L 4 ’ 5 n l CklSh and dirt y- Place is flanked by rugged t u at N i f 11 ! 1 S ;’ 18 rock y ground, with no shade beyond that afforded by the hills to S. in early morning.

Camping ground at Latidan is immediately to S.-W T . cor- ncr of date grove, just inside which is the one well that pro vided water here. Well is open, circular and built of stone; a. present had de pth of 2 feet of water, which is sweet wi thout any brackish taste. To S. are more date groves and a small hamlet.

At this time river averaged depth of .1 foot and breadth of 30 feet. Water very salt. Hoad now lies about | mile S. of 2 old ruined stone bridges and goes straight to Jangui, not bending N. W. and 8. W. through Baraimi as shown on degree sheet. Fast bank of river affords a level approach, west bank needs ramping for wheeled traffic, except at actual ford, as it is sheer for about 8 feet to N. and 8. of ford. From river, track proceeds over hard, scrub-dotted plain to Jangui cisterns. These are two in number, water in each being sweet. Also a caravanserai in fair repair. To 8. at a distance of 300 yards to 400 y ards is a date grove and behind this another cistern with sweet water. Depth of water in each cistern 2. T wo miles beyond Jangui track passes Birkeh Daraz, a cistern containing only a small quantity of water at this time. Tank is rectangular, partially roofed over. Hence to Kuristan road is slightly rough, becoming stony in parts. Two or three small nullas are crossed, all easy of ap proach. River shown on map as crossing the road at Kaleh Puru was dry. Kuristan 5 about 2 miles W. of this dry river bed, is marked by a caravansemi, four ruined or disused cisterns, one small cis tern containing little water and two large domed cisterns with plenty of water at this time. One was filled to a depth of 12 feet, other had about 6 feet in it. Water in both is sweet. Firewood plentiful though scattered. Supplies nil; no habitations near. Grazing for pack animals good. Ground is somewhat stony. Several fair sized trees are dotted about plain. All six wells shown on degree sheet were dry13 Route No. 29—contd. very stony, winding through broad gullies, rising from, and fall- mg to, dry nullas going much impeded by stony nature of track.

Gorge is fairly broad throughtout with steep hills to N. and S. (not properly shown on degree sheet). Its length is about 4 miles and finally debouches into a broader }evel valley at Sartang. Throughout gorge no gradient to speak of, going very heavy owing to loose boulders and stones. River is crossed several times. In its present state the gorge would present very serious difficulties to the passage of wheeled traffic. Camping ground stony. Serai in good repair and a cistern with plenty of fresh water. There is also a small stream of fresh water, slightly brackish, running from the hills to the N., through a small date grove near the serai. Depth of water in Birkeh about 5 feet. Firewood scanty.

Bast-i-Kamku (about 2 miles from Sartang) and another just after passing Birkeh-i- Jamah (shown on map as Najamal). Also there are one or two dips and rises shortly before the plain of Hormuz is reached. Track is stony in character with a few short reaches of sand or gravelly going. Several small dry nullahs are crossed $ also small brackish streams. Stage is, as far as gradients go, practicable for wheeled traffic but stony nature of ground would render going very difficult in parts. At Hajamal is a large serai and cistern which has but little water in it at this time of year. Hormuz is marked by a large serai in good repair, another ruined serai, a dry cistern and a cistern with some 8 feet water, sweet, at this time. To S.-W are extensive date groves, watered by a small stream. Some hundreds of yards to N. of serai is a small village where a small quantify of milk can be obtained. No other supplies obtainable. Plain here is very wide and extensive, grazing for transport animals appears to be good. Firewood plentiful but scattered.15 Route No. 29 ~ contd . 9 BADINI .. 12 m.

A small smooth ridge of rock bars the entrance to the Buzan gorge which is fairly level, stony going for about f mile till pass culminates in Buzan Gardan, which, though of comparatively easy gra dient throughout, is in its present state an impassable obstacle for wheeled traffic, owing to the narrowness of the track and large boulders strewn everywhere. Down from top of pass is an easy slope to plain about 100 feet below and remainder of stage is level, easy going over a wide and barren plain. Chaki, 6 miles out, has two dry cisterns. Bahini has two serais in good repair, three cisterns, two large and one small. Two are dry and 3rd has about three feet water; small, level open space, for camping ground. Also one dry well near camping ground. Firewood scattered but ample. No supplies or habitations. Grazing for transport animals fair, but some distance from cisterns. 10 BAST-I-PABIAB .. 21 m.

Leaving Lar road runs through a flat, level val ley, stony in places, for about 4 miles where an easy rise is breasted. Hoad lies for next mile over a tableland. Descending from this by an easy gradien t, it enters a flat valley which gradually gets narrow, and finally ends in a defile which rises gently for about 1J miles. From top of pass to bottom the descent is very steep at first, the road zig- zaging down. Riding impossible owing to rocks and boulders. This descent makes stage impassable for wheels. Track too is very narrow in places and has been walled up in places. From top to bottom of pass is about 2 miles and this is all impassable for wheels except last few hundred yards. Onwards road is excellent, running over a level plain and surface is very hard. Dah Kuh is reached after crossing small ridge which presents no obstacle. Dah Kuh has a village and serai and several “birkehs.” Fire wood very scanty. Supplies negligible for a force more than a section strong. Camping ground excellent—a large fiat plain.

This gardan is quite impassable tor wneels and is m places difficult even for mules, owing to the large boulders and narrowness of track. It is an alternative route to track through Tang-i-Kalun, which though more or less level, is very narrow and far more stony even than the “ gardan.” After traversing plain for about 1 mile, track enters a fairly broad valley, leaving mouth of Tang-i-Kalun on left, adjacent to a very deep, steep, narrow gorge. Thence it proceeds in an N - W. direction to halting place at Rizak, through the valley, ground rising and continuing to rise from about 4 miles short of Aizak. In one pmce track dips abruptly down into a gorge at bottom of which is brackish stream which runs through^Tancr-i- Kalu. Last 4 miles may be considered impassable for wheels owing to the large stones and boulders and absence of any well defined track. • J19 Route No. 29— contd . Rizak is overlooked by the ruins of a fort and village. There is a small stream of good fresh water here and ample firewood. Supplies nil.

It leaves the usual J ahrum route almost immediately after leaving Rizak. Owing to large number of obstacles met with in track, large boulders, stones, narrow’ clefts, etc., the stage may be considered as impassable for wheeled traffic. Greater part of way is stony going. Leaving Rizak track winds through a valley with minor under-features, culminating in a steep ridge up which the track zigzags. Descending, track reaches a small tract of level plain with an open plain to the right, before re entering a series of valleys. Half w r ay out, ruined fort and patch of cultivation known as Murdak is passed ; further, after breasting another rise, track enters a wide undulating plateau, thickly dot ted with scrub. This narrows down into a broadish valley, and some cultivation and a stream of writer are met with, the latter running parallel to track for some little way. A ridge is again breasted and from top the track, now more or less a bridle path, runs along a saddle with a gradual descent to fort and mud huts of Dehnian, at the extremity of a spur. Here is a masonry water channel, full of good water, gardens and some cultivation. Supplies practically nil, grazing good, there is a small, fairly level space for a dumping ground for caravans. Firewood abundant. 18 QUTBABAJ) .. 12| m. Track descends ab- ■ ruptly from salient on 248f m. which the fort and village of Dehnian are situated, and follows a stony river bed for a short distance, turning left on to a broad plain surrounded by hills and dotted with hillocks. Plain is fertile and has small streams of fresh wmter here and there. Fortified villages of Hormuz and Abdaiun, each with patches of cultivation round it, are passed. Surface of track, wdiich is practically level throughout its length, is generally good and free from stones ; track is passable through out for wheeled traffic.20 Route No. 29— contd. T wo water-mills with running streams are massed when nearing Qutbabad. ^ s ^ Qutbabad is a large fortified village, walled round, with a large enclosed grove of date palms near by, to E. of village.

From Qutbabad track ' ' winds over a stony un- 264J m. ^ ^ dulating plain, until easy gradient of Kutal-i-Taklit-i-Sang is reached. From summit of pass road descends very gradually, debouching at bottom into a flat plain dotted with cultivation, and hard of surface, without any stones. Track is passable for artillery throughout stage. Fidishkuh is a large village, with cultivation and date grovo surrounding it. The village of Sannun is quite close to it. Supplies obtainable in very fair quantities. Water from a stream. A force would have to camp some distance outside village as space near it is somewhat limited owing to cultiva tion and gardens. 20 FASA .. 12 m. Track winds over very * * ' fertile plain, undulating 27 6J m. at first, then level, water ed by several small streams. It is everywhere passable for wheeled trafhe. Several villages are passed en route, Fasa is a town of fair size, with gardens, stream and a long bazaar. Supplies of all sorts available in considerable quantities. 21 MIAN JANGAL .. 18 m. From Fasa level eulti- • —- vated plain for about 284J m. 2 miles ,then track rises very gradually for about another 6 miles winds through low foot-hills, plentifully dotted wuth scrub, 8 miles out there is a ruin with a few small springs of water near and from here track dips gently down and becomes rather more stony in charac ter. There are several small ups and downs but the stage is passable throughout for wheeled traffic.Boute No. 29 — Mian Jangal is on a level plain, dotted with scrub. Caravan serai, shrine and small stream. No supplies. Grazing, fuel, water and firewood plentiful. 22 j SAR VISTAN .. 17 m. Road winds through a jungle for about 6 miles, 3011 m. ^ rising very gradually, thence dips abruptly down a rather steep gradient, thence un dulating for about another mile wdien it passes by a watch tower where there is a stream of good water. From tower track descends gradually, following course of a stream down to a level plateau where the track runs parallel again to a stream. Surface of road excellent. Whole of stage may be taken as passable for wheels though part that lies through jungle is stony in parts. Sarvistan. A fair sized town with trees ; stream.

At 19 miles is shallow nulla and then two low ridges, and 1£ mile further on some ruins and a rain water reservoir. Here 237G3B22 Route No. Zl-'B—contd. road divides left to Farashband, right to Janiabad. At about 2 mlie ^ Uj ^ ler ^ res ^ 1 water spring. It is necessary just about here to make a detour by a mule path to the E. for about 5,600 feet owmg to a large slippery rock barring the track. There are numerous wild almond and turpentine trees about. At about 22 miles ruined serai Pazaunu, with streamlet of iiesh water running alongside road is reached. There is a geneial descent for about the next 7 miles, the road traversing a series of small cups, or plateaux, in the descent. These cups are steep and in some cases have very rocky approaches and exits. At- 29 miles the road leaves the Tang-i-Bizan, and on the E. sine passes an old ab ambar for rain water (Ab Ambar-i-Bizari). The road now becomes level and good and crosses nulla, 150 feet broad with steep shelving banks on both sides. For the next mile or so road deflects to S. (afterwards taking a general direc tion of W. -N. -W. for remainder of march), and traverses an amphi theatre surrounded by mountains. At 3J miles J mile S. of road is a long rocky mound known as Kalat-i-Zangiran, said to have been an ancient fortress rising to a height of some 300 feet. Bo ad continues good, skirting the mountains to the N. and a mile or so further on passes a little Imamzadeh, just oft the road to the N. and hidden away in a cleft in the hillside. Almost opposite the cleft, about 200 feet S. of road, is a deep Well, Chah-i- Daraz, of fresh water said to be fed by springs descending from the imamzadeh. At miles from Farashband there are large clumps of Kamar on both sides of the road, and remains of wells and of water-courses. At 2 miles from Farashband on S. of road are ruins known as Che bar Taq. Out in the plain to the S.-E. is the village of Barmeh, said to be 2 farsakhs distant. B-oad now passes patches of wheat cultivation. The last mile into Earashband is barren. Farashbandis said to contain 300 houses and 1,000 inhabit ants, 150 cows, 300 donkeys, 600 sheep and goats, 400 horses. Wheat is liar vested at end cf May. Ca mping ground. —Good.

No. of stage and total dis tance. Details. 1 SAADATABAD to 18 m. General direction ARSINJAN to S.-E. The road leaves 18 m. AKBARABAD. the S.-E. corner of Saa databad in an S.-S.-E. direction hugging the hills on the N. of the Saadatabad Valley. This is a fertile valley about 3 miles in width. At 1 mile the road verges in an S.-E. direction towards the centre of the valley. There is a gradual ascent till at 3f- miles a kind of girdan joining N. and S. ranges of hills is topped. Dwarf jungle now com mences. The edge of the hills to the S. is fairly thickly fringed with trees. Hills are now about 1 mile distant on either side of the road. At 4| miles a gradual descent commences. At 5 miles ground becomes undulating over small choppy hills. Dwarf jungle continues and road is much overlooked but easy to picquet. Can generally see about J mile clearly on either side of road. At miles a branch road is met with ; the right road should be taken. At 8 miles the country becomes more open and the valley broadens. At 9§ miles the head of a qanat is reached, the water leaving it in a fast flowing stream, affords excellent and plentiful drinking water. At 10J miies the direction changes to E.-S.-E. the road now going along the edge of the southern range. At 11 miles the gardens of Arsin- jan come into sight; general direction changing to S.-E. by E. Stream or jube from qanat mentioned above follows and is adjacent to N. side of road. At Ilf miles another small jube from the S. joins the above-mentioned jube. These two jubes form two sides of a good camping ground on the S. of the road.24 i# 1 * 0 **, large enough to accommodate a Brigade of all arms. About niile to the N. of the junction of these jubes is a ruined fort. The road now passes by a network of qanats. At 15 miles the outskirts of Arsinjan are reached. The village itself is on the far side of this entrance and is about J mile in length from the edge of the gardens. The road throughout presents no obstacles and light gradients. It is fit for all arms and all Government transport. 0 Slightly too rough for country carts, but with slight clearing would be fit for motor traffic^ Continuing from Arsinjan in anS.-E by E. direction over flat country with no defined track, at 174- miles the fort of Akbarabad is reached. This is a small fort of some 30 to 40 houses. It belongs to Mirza All Akbar Khan, munshi of the Qawam-ul- Mulk. Water .—Plentiful and good from a jube, but not very clear. Provisions .—Practically nil this year, there being only suffi cient for home consumption. Wood scarce. Camping ground. —Extensive. Arsinjan.—Owing to several bad years population has been reduced to about 700 families. Kasabeh. This year water has been scarce, and also after two years of locusts provisions have been reduced to a minimum. In good years a fair estimate would be 20,000 to 30,000 T. maunds of barley, bhusa and wheat. There are many flocks of sheep and goats. Thougn difficult to a-acme the exact amounts available, yet it is wrong to consider this 'place as one of unlimited supplies when the maintenance of a column on the march is concerned. This vea r (1917) in the month of September nothing like full rations J ^ n KOfb finrUfinor rrmn and personnel and baggage animals. Wood is plentiful. No wheat was obtainable. Its Kalantar is Shir Khan. 2 GUMAN .. 16 ra tio ally due S. across clear flat country with no defined track. At 2| miles the 34 m open &lt;25 Route No. 48-A-—confeL fort of Aliabad is reached. A small fort of 30 to 40 houses ; it belongs to Malik-i-Tuja, Rais-i-Tajira, Shiraz. Some 1,000 lbs, barley and 4,000 lbs. bhusa were obtained from this place by persuasion. Leaving Aliabad in a S.-E. direction by a well defined track at 4-J miles the fortified village of Kalat-i-Khaur is reached. This village is situated at the Northern base of a high isolated rock. It consists of some 60 houses and belongs to the Banan-ul- Mulk. Immediately to the west ox this village and at a distance of some 600 yards are situated the forts of Hosainabad and Rafi- abad : belonging to the former is also a walled-in garden. These two forts aie cjuite adjacent to one another. Direction now changes shaip to S.-E. and the road with a gradual ascent enters close hilly country and is much commanded on both sides. At 5| miles the direction verges to S.-E. by S. Going is now some what stony and rocky. At 6|- miles a small girdan is topped, and the road descends from, this in a E.-S.-E. direction along the slope of the northern hills. Immediately to the S. of and some 200' below the road is a broad watercourse, on the other side of which are small hills and beyond these a large valley sparsely wooded and quite devoid of habitation. Then further to the S. of this valley is a main range of mountains. At 8 miles direction changes to E. The road continues much commanded by low hills on either side and country is sparsely wooded. The descent continues for a short distance and then a gradual rise till at 10 miles the Girdan-i-Shah Bas All is topped. It is command ed immediately on either side by hills. Very shortly after passing this girdan there is a small well about 200 yards to the S. of the road, said to contain good water. Road now descends rapidly and then ascends with a fairly steep gradient to Il|- miles when the girdan-i-Gumun is topped, commanded immediately on either side by high hills. The direction now verges to E.-S.-E. the road descending fairly rapidly to a small valley. At 134 miles this valley is left, the road verging round a spur of the Northern range, the direction changing to E. The road hugs these b ills for a short distance and verges out on to the Kafien. At 16 miles Gumun is reached, or rather where the village of Gumun used to be. Not even the remains of this village are visible now. There is a broad stream of water here which emanates from a large deep pool at 287GSB26 Route No. m-k—contd. Gumun collected by large artificial “ bands.” Water is clear but very brackish Wood is obtainable in fairly large quantities from the hills ciose by. Grass in large quantities is obtainable rom banks of the stream. Animals ate the grass well. Camping grounds extenive. Road in this stage is passable by all transpoi t as far as Kalat-i-Khaur. Thence to Gumun is now fit for animal transport only, but with comparatively small clear ing and preparation could be made fit for all transport and motors—blasting required in very few places only. TASHT .. 11m. General direction E. ___ _ (Kalleh R ahim The road commences in 45 m. Arm a). an easterly direction along the edge of a large artificial bank through high grass jungle. At | mile the road emerges from this jungle out on to the edge of the Kaffeh and continues E. hugging the large hills on the N. which dangerously overlook the road. At 1 mile direction verges to S.-E. by S. At miles a large spur is skirted and direction swings round to a little S. of E.-S.-E. The road continues at the loot of high northern hills ; to the S. is the Kaffeh for many miles. At 7|-miles a further large spur known as the Fuseh Mishi—and the direction now verges to N.-E. by E. This spur may be taken as the entrance to the Lashani valley, and has evi dently at one time been fortified, for the remains of an old wall runs from the base of the Puseh Mishi to the edge of the Kaffeh which is usually impassable. This would be a formidable defence to break through if resolutely held. At miles direction changes to N-E. by N. passing through a passage commanded on the east by an isolated hill and on the west by the main range. Also difficult passage to force if held by an enemy. At 11 miles the Buj-i-Rahim Agha is met with situated on a spur which slopes down from a hill on the W.; around this Ruj are situated some 120 tents. Water here is from a large well which is somewhat brackish. Continuing in the same direction over a very fertile valley at 12|- miles there is an imanzada which is situated at the base of high mountains on the N. The imanzada is approached through thick pomegranate gardens nestling at the western base of a three peaked isolated rocky hill. Very excellent and abund ant water comes out of the mountains near the imanzada. The whole of this valley is known as Tasht. It is most fertile, turf/ Route No. 48-A— contd. grass and reed grass abundant. Crops standing : only arzun. Impossible to report on supplies as everything had been removed. One room in the Buj was found to be full of bliusa. Barley is evidently largely grown. The Buj has been destroyed: thus this one landmark has disappeared. Wood appears scarce. Camping grounds extensive. The Lashanis of Tasht when in flight evidently stored much property near the conical peak of a high hill immediately over looking the valley to the west. Live stock probably taken, north via Tang-i-Gazi mentioned in the next stage. There is an alternative road through the hills from Gumun of Tasht. This road leaves the former place a few degrees N. to E. The girdan is recognised by the dark colouring of the rock on it. The road reported on must certainly be impassable when even slightly wet. On the supposition that the Lashanis would hold this entrance to their valley, it may be considered a most difficult entrance. 4 ABADEH .. 6 m. General direction * E.-S.-E. A pathway 51 m. over a level grass and reed plain. At 1| miles the small fort of Nasrullah is met with -—probably about 30 to 40 families. Fort and tents now destroy ed. At 3J miles the Tang-i-Gazi is 1 to 1J miles to the N. through the northern range. There is said to be a fine spring here. The Tang is fortified with sangars and is a refuge to the Lashanis in retreat. Continuing in the same direction and simi lar conditions, at 6 miles Abadeh is reached. This consists of two forts well out in the plain a good two miles from the nearest hills. The forts go by the names of Lutuffuilah and Ilossain All Akbar. Water from large wells, slightly brackish. The only crop standing near the forts was arzun. In both large quanti ties of bhusa were found but no barley, which was evidently well hidden. The Kaffeh is a little over 2 miles to the S. of the forts. At a little over 1 mile to N.-N.-E. are extensive fruit gardens, at the northern extremity of which is situated an old fort by name Taji Ka. Some 60 tents were burnt in and around this fort. Again large quantifies of bhusa were found here.Route No. 4 &amp;- k .— contd . No barley or wheat—large quantities of nuts and about 80 lbs. of rice. These gardens and fort are watered by a jube originat ing from a qanat in the hills. Good and abundant w^ater. Very many acres of Jowahir were standing around the gardens. At miles S.-E. of Taji Ka is Deh Zir, consisting of Kalleh Agha Beg and Kalleh Naiamutullah (in course of con struction). From the number of tents and reed huts left stand ing there must be about 150 families belonging to this village, perhaps more. Water slightly brackish. Arzun the only crop standing. Fair quantities of bhusa were found but no barley or wheat. These forts are situated in the plain, the nearest hills being 1 mile to the N.-E., and the Kaffeh 1J miles to the south. Everything was destroyed. 5 KWAJA JAMALI 8f m. General direction * * E. by N. Direction 59f m. commences E. over gra velly stony ground, easy going but no defined road. There is a very gradual ascent and at 2f miles low hills are entered. A large high peak was noticed 1 mile to the N. Direction now changes to E. by S. a steady continuous rise overlooked by low hills on both sides. At 4 miles the track from Abadeh to Kwaja Jamali is met with and taken, the direction verging to E.-N.-E. The road continues its gradual ascent in similar country topping a succession of small girdans. At 6 miles direction changes to N.-N.-E. and a short sharp ascent of J mile follows to the final pass which is topped at 6| miles, whence a very fine view is obtained of Kwaja Jamali and its valley. The road now goes in a N.-E. by N. direction, a short, sharp but easy descent into the valley, thence over stony uneven ground, much cut up by shallow nullas. At 8| miles Kwaja Jamali is reached. This consists of one large fort and some 400 houses strongly rein forced by stone walls. There are extensive fruit gardens to the N. Barley and arzun appear to be the crops grown. The hills too are cultivated with grape vines. Kwaja Jamali is closely over looked by hills from the east, the north and the West. Good and abundant water from a j ube originating from a spring 500 yards W. of animamzada Much bhusa and barley were found but no rwheat. Kalantar, Siawdosh Khaix29 Koute No. 48-A.— conid. There are said to be three roads which lead on to Kwaja Jamali from the N. The high N. range is called Kuh-i-Kura which commences from the N. of Arsinjan. Wood. —plentiful. Camping grounds —Extensive but bad. 6 JAHfJNABAD ... 8 m. Direction S. by E. * The road commences a J m. gentle decline hugging the western hills for J mile, when it reaches a clear open plain. This it continues till at 8 miles the large fort of Jahunabad is reached. Immediately to S. of and adjacent to the fort is a large new walled-in garden. There are two other forts i mile S. of Jahunabad, the western one belonging to Mehdi Ghuli Khan and the eastern one to Mullah Abdul Rassul, both of the Sheikh Ali section of the Lashani tribe, which consists of about 800 families in tents in the Pichakum valley on the S. of the Kaffeh. f mile E. of Jahunabad is the Fort Kushkak belong ing to Mulla Abdulla, and a further 2 miles to the E. of this again is the Kalleh Hossainabad belonging to Mahamed LatifL All these forts have been destroyed. The Fort of Jahunabad is said to be Fakr-es-Sultan’s own fort. Water good and plentiful from a qanat. Very many acres of jowahir and arjun were standing. Much bhusa Was found but no barley. Wood scarce. Camping grounds extensive. At 10 to 11 miles E. by N. of Jehanabad is the village of Deh Murd. It is situated close up to the foot of the northern hills and ?from appearances has extensive gardens. One part is of the Hindi tribe. Five parts belong to Fakr-es-Sultan; his chief men here being Ali Mirza and Karram. All the Lashani forts enumerated in this report have been destroyed. If they are rebuilt it is unlikely the sites will vary much on account of the water and already established gardens. It has been impossible to gauge exactly the amount of provisions obtainable. It is very doubtful if more than is sufficient for their own consumption is grown. The Lashani Valley is very fertile and has great possibilities. To open a road through this country would be a comparatively easy matter as far as labour is concerned.30 Route No. 4&amp;-k.—contd. 7 CHAH GAZ «*. 5 m. General direction S.-E. Road runs across the open plain. At 3f miles a narrow bit of Kavir is reachejd which would be very heavy in wet weather. Chah Gaz is reached at 5 miles. Camping ground extensive. Water slightly brackish from numerous wells, gome cultivation. Inhabitantsf are Qara Arabs living in tents, and consist of from 30 to 40 families. They have large flocks but no other supplies. Grazing for camels plentiful. 8 TANG-I-HANAH : 19 m. The road, leaving Chah Kavir. ^ At 3 miles a small white isolated peak is reached and at 7 miles Chah Guraki, with half a dozen wells of sweet water but no houses or inhabitants. At 9 miles a smal 1 kotal is reached with a steep ascent for about 100 yards. From here the road crosses the Kavir to Da Dushtak, whence it continues over open slopes until it descends into a river bed | mile before reaching Tang-i-Hanah. ^ Camping giound sufficient for a brigade, surrounded by hills bmall springs of sweet water—sufficient for a brigade if careful arrangements are made for guarding it. Slight improvements required for watering any large number of animals. 9 ALIABAD .. 15 m. ^ The road from Tang- steep gracnenr on tne JN. side for 100 yards. At 2b miles a smafl spring of sweet water is reached and at 3 miles a lame white hdl to the west of the road. At 5 miles a narrow deep nulla, impassable without bridging comes to within 200 yards of the road. This nulla comes from the hills to the north and bears away to the S.-E. At 6| miles thin scrub is entered. From here there is a gradual descent over a wide plain and then an easy ascent to a kotal which is reached at 10 miles. From the kotal there is a gradual descent to within 2| miles of Aliabad. Before reaching Aliabad one small nulla (5 feet deep and 6 yards wide) has to be negotiated. ^ 91§ m.
