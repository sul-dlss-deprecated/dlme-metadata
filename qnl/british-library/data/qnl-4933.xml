In my note of the 4th on the Basidu Flag incident I dealt with io immediate repercussions. I feel, however, that even wider issues are concerned affecting our general policy in Persia and the Persian Cfulf. If our naval base, for instance, instead of being in Persian territory at Henjam was elsewhere* in Arab territory, Bahrein for instance, the incident would not have occurred, as preaumably our main interest in Basidu irs as an alternative Mse to Hen jam in case the Persians at any time definitely order us to quit the latter place. Once the base is installed at Bahrein, Basidu would presumably lose interest for us and possibly the question of renouncing it altogether in return for some quid pro quo from the Persian Government could be considered. 2. The questions of Henjam and Basidu are therefore, in a certain sense, interdependent, and politically our presence in the former place appears to me a definite source of weakness. In shaping our policy towards the Persian Government our hands are tied by the fact that the latter can at any moment eject us from Henjam, while our presence there lays us at all times open to pin pricks from local officials over petty matters, with the danger every now and then - as the Basiau Flag incident has shown - of some open insult. In fact, to sum up the position briefly, it appears to me that our naval base at Henjam embitters our relations with Persia; hampers our policy towards that country, and is the indirect cause of incidents which are damaging to i our prestige. 3. In these circumstances the arguments for continuing our base at Henjam must be of the strongest. Should our base be moved from Henjam to the Arab Coast then it has, I think, been generally decided that Bahrein is the best locality. The arguments in favour of Henjam, as I understand them, come under the following main categories: A. Strategical. B. Financial. C. Climatical Of// y ■ i ¥ is /^~~~ Of these categorieB-presumably the most Important-y y &lt; is A. It would of course be outside my province to v&gt; iOTment on such a highly technicel matter as arguments o~ v &gt; , w qika-j-*-* CJ U i „i j p-Vi-v /,• naval strategy, even if I knew what the arguments in this particular case were, v/hich as a matter of fact I do not* \ X y In the considerable volume of official literature with which ■ j-*- V Henjsm is encrusted, I do not remember to have seen them detailed, though perhaps I may have missed them. If they have not been detailed I venture to suggest that it would be of interest $ to learxr what they are. With regard to B. This is also a weighty consideration but I do not think that a detailed estimate of the cost of a move to Bahrein has ever been drawn up. If this is so I suggest that it would be worth while to have one made. With regard to C, This is a point in which I have had some practical experience and as far as this goes I should certainly say that Hen jam in the summer months is a better climate than Bahrein and that in the winter they are much of a muchness. Here, however, my opinion is merely that of a layman and not that of an experienced medical officer. Would it not be as well to have the rival climates of the two places pronounced on by expert medical opinion? 4, The arguments in favour of a move to Bahrein are briefly: (1) That the political objections to our continuance at Henjam would disappear. (2) That His Majesty's ships would have their oil fuel on the spot, though for full advantage to be taken of this presumably the oil would have to be refined locally. 5. Henjam is of course one of the questions to be adjusted in the forthcoming treaty negotiations with the PersianPersian Government. Even if formally adjusted, however, in the shape of a lease or whatever other arrangement is ^ome to, personally I doubt whether, the Persians being what they are, this will obviate the risk of further incidents On the other hand if it was decided to abandon Henjam, a trump card in the hands of the Persians for these negotiations would be removed and it might possibly be easier to settle the other points involved. 6. I am afraid that in this note I have encroached on matters which are perhaps, strictly speaking, beyond my purview. As you are aware, however, Gulf affairs are so complicated and concern so many different departments that that it is difficult sometimes for the Resident to keep entirely to his own 'parish' when giving his views. 6th September, 1933.J f II Note by Metcalfe. Foreign Sefl.rat£r^ to the Government of Inaia^ .CLn-Ia£g&amp; . I agree entirely with Colonel Fowled main point which is I understand that, if we could say to the Persian Government that we no longer require Henjam, our position with regard to the general Treaty negotiations would be very much strengthened and we should no longer have to submit to pin-pricks from the Persians in order to avoid eviction from a place, where we admittedly have no right to be without Persian consent. The only further point which seems to deserve consideration is what would be our position at Henjam in the event of war with a third Power e.g. Russia or Japan, in which Persia remained neutral. Would our occupation of Henjam with our naval forces not constitute a violation of Persian neutrality to which Persia would be bound to object as long as the Island remains Persian territory. The position at Bahrein would presumably be different as the Sheikh is already in close alliance with us and would have no inducement to remain neutral. At any rate it seems desirable that the whole question of a transfer of the naval base from Henjam to Bahrein should be considered in detail from the points of view suggested by Colonel Fowle without delay. tt-n f rusx * 2lst September 1933.J 1 6 * BRITISH ITA^nT : - 1.

PERSIAli (jLILF : H e n i a ii - Question of removal of Naval base Copy of FOR INFORMATION. It was arranged at the meeting on December 17th which Lr. Anderson attended that the Admiralty and the Foreign Office should draw up a joint memorandum on the question - regarding which their views could not be reconciled - whether the Naval depot should remain at Henjam, or be moved, e.g., to Bahrein. After three months' solid work 12 pages and 22 paragraphs of r memorandum have been produced, but the question is no nearer solution. The memorandum is light and interesting, and repays perusal, but if time cannot be found to take the whole course, paragraph 22 gives the divergent views in a nutshell. Dialectically one would say that the Foreign/Foreign Office carried the day, but as a practical Admiralty’s view that we shouio. hang on at henjam* the question at present, for the resumption of the negotiations has resulted m a changed situation. Taimourtache has actually requested us to withdraw the renuest for a lease at Henjam, and in effect to clear out Now, whatever the answer may be in the long run to the V question whether we should transfer the depot or not, it is undoubtedly the case that Henjam is much the most ! convenient spot in the Gulf; moreover, it is the Inaia Office contention that the retention of henjam is trie j on iy benefit of any substance that we stand to gain from the conclusion of a treaty. Further, the Foreign Office suggestion that we should clear out of henjam before we are asked to - is no longer valid, as we have in effect already been asked^o s^ tathe changed circumstances, therefore, it 10 obvioiisi,v- j^r policy cling to Henjam.

(Signed) CM HIND. 2, Whitehall Gardens, SoYAl., 12th April, 1932©t f f Memorandum ty Admiralty and Foreign Office, dated 23rd February, 1932 on the subject of the British Naval x Depot at Henjam. A difference of view has arisen between certain- departments of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the policy to be followed in connection with the British Naval Dep&lt;$t on the Persian island of Henjam. The question has been fully discussed by the Middle East Official Sub-Gommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and it has proved impossible to reach agreement. It has therefore become necessary to refer it to the Ministerial Sub-Committee. 2. The small island of Henjam lies close to and on the seaward side of the large island of Kishm which adjoins the Persian coast near the mouth of the Persian Gulf. It possesses a valuable anchorage, and has important climatic and strategic advantages. The Admiralty regard it as by far the most suitable point in the Persian Gulf for a Naval depot for His Majesty’s Ships operating in the Gulf; and they attach great importance to the advantages which the continued use of this island offers to the British Navy In connection with the duties of His Majesty’s Ships on the Trucial Coast and the coast of Muscat and Oman. 3o The history of our position at Henjam is briefly as follows. In 1868 sanction was obtained by His Majesty's - 1 - x Since this memorandum was drafted there have been subsequent developments which will be dealt with separately.- 2 - pmmmamrn Government from the Shs-h of Persia for the establishment of a telegraph station on the island, subject to tne proviso c .ic.t the number of employees and the extant of the buildings shouxa not in future exceed those agreed upon at the time. The telegraph station was established and maintained until 1881, when it was temporarily abandoned, but it was re-establishea m 1904. The Persian Government showed considerable suspicion of the intentions of His Majesty's Government in re-establishing the telegraph station, and an inconclusive controversy followed as to the precise limits of the telegraph concessions, etc., In the course of this correspondence His Majesty's Government formally recognised, as they had already done on previous occasions, that the island was und- r the full sovereignty of Persia. His Majesty’s Government did however inform xhs Persian Government that the fact of former occupation from 1869 to 1881 was regarded by them as the equivalent ox formal concession of the land then held, jn 1911 the British Naval authorities Began to utilise Henjam as their principal naval depot in the Gulf, ana in 1912 the stocks of coal, formerly maintained at Basidu on the neighbouring island of Kishm, were removed to Henjam, A number of storehouses and other buildings were subsequently erected near the telegraph buildings* A coaling pier was also completed by the British Naval authorities in 1921* communication appears to have teen m^de c.o ^ia regarding these developments, but in 1914, a formal offer ?^s n^e to Persia for the purchase or lease of Hanjam* ihis oiter led to no result. During the ¥ar period and until some six or- 3 - ■■■■■■■■■ seven years ago the Persian Government exercised comparative3.y little authority in south-eastern Persia, and the continued use of Hen jam hy British ships of 'war does not appear to have teen questioned^ Since 1926, however, Persia has developed rapidly on entirely new lines” the authority of the Central Government has teen gradually extended to outlying provinces, and the growth in Persia of a spirit of intense xenophote nationalism has led to increasing resentment against British political predominance in the Persian Gulf and especially against the British position on the Persian coast of the Gulf, Various difficulties arose in 1926 and 1927 Between the Persian Government and the Arat Sheikh of Henjam, and in 1928 a number of Persian troops were despatched to the island 0 In 1929 the attempt was renewed by His Majesty 1 s Government to secure a lease from the Persian Government of the area at Henjam required for the British naval depot, as part of a general political settlement with Persia* Although a draft lease was prepared, however, and formed the subject of much negotiation no agreement was reached on several important points, such as that of police jurisdiction, and when negotiations were abandoned it could not be said that any settlement of this question was in sight. 5 0 Since the negotiations for a general political settlement and for a lease of Henjam were suspended in October, 1930, events have developed on lines which, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, must render the British position in Henjam increasingly precarious and unsatisfactory* 6* In the first place, the Persian Government have now acquired two gunboats and four motor-patrol vessels, Thu-ch have- 4 - teen constructed for them in Italy and are to he commanded ty Italian officers in the Persian service. These ships are due to arrive in the Persian Gulf next March, and their arrival will mark an important change in the situation,, for hitherto His Majesty’s Ships have been the only warships stationed in the Gulf 0 It is at present intended that the Persian vessels shall he based at Bushire; hut, while the shore accommodation at Bushire may present certain advantages, it is understood that unless some dredging is carried out the vessels will only he able to enter or leave the harbour at certain stages of the tide, and for a period of some two months in the year will either be precluded from using the harbour, or confined to it without the possibility of putting to sea„ The practical disadvantages of Bushire may well cause the Persians or their Italian advisers to seek a more suitable port. Of the other ports available Moha mine rah might be selected; it is, however, separated from the sea by over fifty miles of river under IracpL sovereignty through which Persia or^yVias) transit rights. At the Northern end of the Gulf, Khor Musa, on which is situated the terminus of the completed southern section of the proposed Trans-Persian railway, might be a suitable harbour, but it may prove difficult to construct adequate shore facilities at what is now little more than a desolate swamp. The Italians and Persxans are not unlike3.y therefore to consider Henjam as the best available alternative to Bushire, and the Foreign Office consider that, if the Persians wish to use Henjam for their own warships, tney are the less likely to continue to tolerate the use of the island by those of a foreign Power. 7 C while the forthcoming arrival of Persian warships may render the British position at Henjam more difficult, there are already indications that the continued use of a Persianisland by foreign naval forces is obnoxious to Persian national feeling* Various minor difficulties have been raised locally by Persian officials; objectionable articles have appeared in the Tehran press; and although the official atti tude of the Persian Government has been satisfactory hitherto, the Persian Minister of Court referred specifically last year, in the course of a controversial correspondence with Sir R 0 Clive in which he endeavoured to show the reasonableness of his attitude in regard to the Treaty negotiations, to the right which, amongst other rights which could not in principle be disputed, Persia had 'not to wish an important naval base to be created near her coast, and consequently to take her own precautions in leasing a part of her territory, or even not to agree to lease her territory at all' 0 Although the British depot at Henjam can hardly be referred to as a 'base', there is little doubt that Teymourtache was referring to it in this letter* 8* It is, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, most improbable that the Persian Government will allow the present anomalous situation to continue much longer* It is conceivable that they may give us formal ncti v e to go, in which case it may be possible to arrange for sufficient time to make alternative arrangements elsewhere; but, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, it is more probable that they will resort to less direct but more immediately effective methods, by which our position could be made untenable without any need for the Persians to resort to force* They could, for example, pass certain legislation, ostensibly of universal application, but in reality directed against the British position at Henjam, and direct their local officials at Henjam strictly to enforce it. There is nothing to prevent Persian military forces frombeing stationed in the island or to prevent this garrison from being increased. The result might be that unless His Majesty's Government vsere prepared to use force, it *ould impocsible for His i-ajesty's ships to continue to use the depot, diplomatic representations at Tehran were to have no effect, the question would arise whether His Majesty’s Governrent were prepared to authorise the British Eavy in the Gulf to take such forcible or other measures against the Persian local authorities as might be necessary to ensure the continued use of Menjm for the period of about fifteen months necessary to make alternative arrangements elsewhere. The Foreign Office consider that as His Majesty’s Government have no treaty justification for using Hen jam, it would not be possible to defend the use of forcible measures against the Persians in such circumstances. 9. The admiralty, on the other hand, do not consider that the question is likely to arise in this form; and if it should arise they feel that it would probably be possible to solve the dispute by diplomatic representations at Tehran. The Persian Government would not, in their opinion, be prepared to risk a serious incident, and would be willing, if pressed, to agree to maintain the statna quo until His .majesty’s Government had had time to make other arrangements. 1C. The Foreign Office think it well to point out that if the question of the British right to remain at Henjam had to be submitted to a judicial decision by e=g., the Permanent Court of International Justice, His Majesty's Government would have nc case. The arguments that Persia has tacitly acquiesced in the present position for twenty years, jid that she has recently entered into negotiations regarding the terms of a lease, would not give His Majesty’sr^ai Government a sufficient legal title to continue to utilise Henjam against the wishes of the Persian Government. The Admiralty do not base any part of their thesis on the assumption that His Majesty's Government could go to arbitration regarding the permanent retention of a British depot at Hen jam v^th an:, prospect of success. They do, however, question the Foreign Office contention that, in the event of it being necessary to have recourse to arbitration in connection with some serious incident forced on us hy the Persians before the expiration of reasonable notice for withdrawal, the British case would be dangerously weakened by the fact that there is little legal justification for our presence in the island e 11. The Foreign Office take the vieTr that our present dependence on Persia for the recreational facilities required by the Navy in the Persian Gulf reakens the entire British political position vis-a-vis the Persian Government, and tnus the entire British position in the Persian Gulf itseli. -nicy consider that it is at present impossible for His Majesty’s Government to take any step likely to be displeasing to tne Persians without exposing themselves to the risk of Persian retaliation at Henjam, and that this renders it most difficult to negotiate with Persia in regard to other (question on equal terns 0 12o In vie?/ of the above considerations, the Foreign Office have strongly urged that, notwithstanding tne undeniaole physical advantages of Henjam as a naval depot, every effort should be made at the earliest possible moment to remove this naval depot from Persian territory and to establish an The Foreign Office consider alternative naval depot elsev.here.#4 mmm v © it of the utmost importance that a decision should he reached without delay regarding the preparation of such an alternative depot, since they regard it as greatly preferable that His Majesty T s Government should leave Henjam of their cvra free will and in advance of acute Persian pressure * rather than that they should wait passively until the Persian action which they anticipate has rendered their continued use of the Island impossibleo They fear that if it is decided simply to wait upon events, sooner or later there v/ill be a widely heralded Persian attempt to secure our abandonment of the use of Hen jamo Such an attempt could hardly fail to be ultimately successful, end our subsecuent withdrawal would then be exploited by the Persians as amoral victory, which would deal a severe blow to British prestige throughout the Gulfo On the other hard, the Forsign Office consider that the blow to British prestige would be less serious if His Majesty's Government should have previously announced their intention to establish an alteraa-civ r e depot at Bahrein since the removal from Hen jam cou-lu thereafter be represented as having ueon already decided upon in Biitish interests e.g. with a view to strengthen the British position at Bahrein 3*11 d on the Arabian coast of &amp;he Gulf* 13. The Admiralty, on the other hand, regard the Foreign Office fear that His Majesty 1 ? Government may be obliged by direct or indirect Persian action to abandon Henjam at any moment as much exaggerated* They point out that we have main tained a naval depot in the island for twenty years and that Persia has tacitly acquiesced in our erection of a uarge lumber of buildings, in our construction of a pier, in our establishment of a beacon and various buoys, and in oui- 9 - fa. { 53 &gt; % continued use of recreation grounds of various kinds without the payment of any rent,, Persia has* in the Admiralty view, gone a long way towards accepting our position at Hen cam hy the serious attempts which have keen made to negotiate a lease with a view to putting our presence in Henjam on a definite legal basis. She has at no time given us any notice to with draw, and has even quite recently entered into an informal but definite understanding to maintain the status quo in the Gulf pending further negotiations. In these circumstances, the Admiralty consider that, should the Persian Government definitely demand our withdrawal from Hen jam, we should be entitled to demand, and ought to be able to obtain, sufficient notice to enable us to prepare an alternative depot elsewhere. Such preparation would take at least fifteen months. Meanwhile, the Admiralty consider that it should be possible to resist any policy of pinpricks on the part of Persia intended to force our withdrawal without notice. They do not anticipate that Persia will nave recourse l.q force with a view to preventing our continued use of Henjan, or oe ab3.e to manoeuvre us into a position where we shall need go use force ourselves. If any attempt were made by Persia to use force, they consider that it could be easi3.y met, since Hen jam, being an island entire]y dependent on the mainland for supplies, wou3.d be under the effective control of a snail naval force c 15 c The Foreign Office cannot accept this view, since they consider that in the circumstances it would be impossible to defend international3-y the use of forcible measures such as the cutting off of the island’s supplies from tne maxnland 0-10 lA) 16. The Admiralty do not share the Foreign Office view that the Persians are becoming increasingly anxious to secure our withdrawal from Eenjam. In their view, the fact that Persia has not definitely demanded our withdrawal, suggests that she is either uncertain as to her policy or at least reluctant to force an immediate issue. They consider it possible that Persia may even prefer our presence at Heniam, which we have definitely recognised as Persian territory, tnan at Bahrein, to which they have put forward a shadow’/ claim which might be weakened by the establishment of a British naval station on that ieland, 17. As regards the Foreign Office view that our prestige in the Gulf will suffer less from an early transfer of the depot before any demand for our evacuation has been made by the Persians, than from evacuation later as a direct result of Persian action, the Admiralty consider that our withdrawal, whenever it occurs, will be generally attributed to Persian ressure, so that the effect on our prestige will be practically the same in either event. Any argument that we had already decided to remove in our own interests would oe unconvinving in view of our efforts during the last two years to get a formal lease for a long term of years, 18. The Admiralty consider that a further reason for not evacuating Hen Jam is t.ta* danger that, if we withdraw, Persia may later lease the habour to some other European Power. The Foreign Office do not consider this a serious proDaoility. 39, The Admiralty are of the opinion that me only possible alternative Naval depot in the Gulf is Bahrein, which is, however, much inferior to Hen Jam from practically every point of view. Its climatic disadvantages are increased by theI'M- II - fact that shallowness of the harbour so raises the temperature of the water as to make life on hoard the vesse^ rtoored there exceedingly difficult and unhealthy, 20. The Foreign Office cannot'do otherwise than accept the Admiralty view that Bahrein is the only practicable alternative to Henjam for a naval depot in the Gulf. . The Persian Government have however advanced a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, and it has been suggested that it may be urwlse for His Majesty’s Government to incur the expenditure of establishing a naval depot at Bahrein until the Persian claim to the island has been definitely disposed of. The Persian claim however, which is based chiefiy on occupation of the island prior to 1783, Is exceedingly weak, and the Foreign Office consider that $ existence, although it may sooner or later have to be settled by a judicial decision, need not be held to rule out Bahrein as a site for a British naval depot, - 21. In any case, however, in order to make Bahrein useable as a naval station a sum which has been recently estimated at from £35,000 to £40,000 would have to be expended. Such expenditure could not be met from the Navy Estimates for 1932 and would require special financial provision. This estimate includes no charge for dredging and would only enable the harbour to be used by small sloops. Extensive dredging opera tions at an estimated cost of some £400,000 would be required to allow of the use of Bahrein by light cruisers. On the other hand, the Foreign Office have drawn attention to the fact that any expenditure incurred at Bahrein would give a permanent return and would therefore present certain advantages over annual expenditure incurred in connection with a lease of Henjam-1 wmmrnmmmmmMk &gt; » s.--'; (r - ^ v from Persia, vfcich v.ouXa. atoost certainly be subject to restrioticns and be of limited diration. 22o The difference of opinion betvieen the various Departments may, therefore, be briefly summarised as follow ^The Admiralty desire to continue to use Eenjam as a naval depot as they have used it with the tacit acquiescence of the Persian Government for the past twenty years, notwithstanding the lack of definite legal sanction for the depot and the possibility that the Persians may at any moment attempt to render our continued use of the island impossible. The Admiralty’s main reasons are that, in their view, there is no case for immediate withdrawal, that the position in not as precarious as the Foreign Office represent it, that the only practicable alterna tive site for a station, i.o. Bahrein, ic very greatly inferior to Henjam from every point of view and that the Persian claim to Bahrein has not yet been finally disposed of. The transfer would moreover involve a considerable capital outlay, and any large capital outlay is objectionable if there is not absolute security of tenure. The Foreign Office, on the other hand, are not prepared to defend our continued presence at Henjam should it be seriously challenged by the Persians; they consider the ri8i that such a challenge will be put forward in the near future in come indirect form most serious, and they therefore strongly urge that we should anticipate Persian pressure by making the necessary preparations for a removal to Bahrein (since the Admiralty consider that this is the only practicable alternative) at the earliest possible moment. As these preparations will require much time and considerable expenditure, a very urgent decision is required. rA 23rd February ? 1932/ * ^ Docoment is £ha Pmpepty of His Britannic Majesty's GoYernjaaat, and ^ $ jr~ rsturned to the Foreign Office if not reouired for official iiJse,-U — fr-. &gt; 7 n FROM i * «* 'i Decode.

Department n. The question of Henjam v/as discussed yesterday afternoon by the Middle East Official Sub consisted mainly of a prolonged between Ivir.lendel for the Foreign Office ( and Captain Cunningham,for the Admiralty were supported to some extent by the Treasury and the India Office; the Colonial Office, the War Office, and the Air Ministry remained neutral. The issue boiled down to this: Should we clear out at once,or should we wait on events? The Foreign Office contended that if we did not quit, the Persians would force us to do so, without notice. a she d how they suggested that the Persians might pass a law prohibiting the landing of foreign #aval or Military personnel on the Island. They might then send a battalion to Henjam, and the next time one of our ships icalled there we would find the jetty lined by Persian soldiers. The Admiralty replied that such a state of affairs would be intolerable, and that we would not stand it for one moment. Mr.Rendel IT You say you would not stand it. What do you mean? 'Would you use force? Would you go to war with Persia? rT rT No. TT said the Admiralty 'but it is about time we took a firm line with them; we have allowed ourselves to be brov/-beaten far too long.'' The Foreign Office then turned to the advantages of Bahrein, and made the statement that our position there would be absolutely secure. Was it not better to pay £40,000 down for such a position, than £1,000 or £2,000 a year for an unsatisfactory lease of a Persian Island? I ventured (to question the complete security of our position at Committee. The meeting, which lasted for 2-J- hours, Admiralty. The Foreign Office fought unaided; the ■ 214 h nooo 8 /:ji Bahrein. What about the Persian claim to suzerainty? WasWas there not a suggestion that we might have to go to arbitration? At this the Treasury representative pricked up his ears. 'Dear me' said he 'arbitration is a tricky business. Do you really suggest that we should pay £40,000 for facilities on an Island, the ownership which is likely to be the subject of arbitration? ' Mf.Rendel assured the meeting that our case in respect of Bahrein a was indefeasible. Here, indeed, was a question over which we could take a firm line. 'Oh? ' said the Admiralty ' .are you prepared to resort to forcible measure^? ' Mr.Rendel would not go so far as to say that, but thought that we could snap our fingers at the Persians. However, the Treasury representative remained unconvinced. He took the line that we ought not to start spending- money on Bahrein until we were quite sure that we were going to be turned out of Henjam. We might have no legal status, but the fact that we had been in undisputed occupation for 20 years surely gave us a strong moral claim, if not to possession, at least to adequate notice. On the question of immediate evacuation, I pointed out that in the latest despatch from Tehran the Minister had stated that ' it is not unreasonable to expect' that negotiations will be resumed ' before next spring': if this was the case, why not hang on in the hopes that nothing serious v/ould happen at Hen jam before then? The Foreign Office contented themselves v/ith replying that the Minister was unduly optimistic (which seems to be their attitude towards all his views which do not coincide with their own). The meeting closed without any decision being arrived at, except that the Foreign Office and the Admiralty should prepare a joint memorandum( ? in parallel columns) to be submitted to the ministerial sub-committee. On the question of finance, I said that India had agreed to pay not more than £500 per annum towards the rent of Henjam. They might increase this figure, but weTHE GUB'COMf ilTTEE had under considerat ion the following Papers:- M.E, (0). 49 - Memorandum prepared 'by the admiralty on the genera], situation in the Persian Gulf from the Naval point of view 5 which had 'been sent from the Secretary of the Admiralty to the Under-secretary of state 5 Foreign Office s on the 7th December j, 1931 » ID Sc ( 0) 50 - Letter on the situation in the Persian GulfA doted October Gath* 1931^ from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty, enclosing copies of despatches to and from KoM-^Minister at Tehran* THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the Foreign Office aid Admiralty representatives v^ished to make opening statements by way of explanation of the letter and memorandum before the Sub-Committee* As neither wished to do so s he proposed that the Sub-Committee should discuss each of the questions raised in paragraph 30 of the Admiralty Memorandum (M.S.(0) 49)* The first of these was whether the special British position in the Gulf * and particularly our position vis -a- yls the Arabian rulers now in treaty relations with us is to be maintained.? CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM said that the Admiralty had asked this question in view of the importance of a suitable base in order that the duties assigned to the Naval forces in the Gulf may be effectively carried out. MR, RENDEL said that so far as he was aware no one questioned the necessity of maintaining the British position in the Gulf* It was indeed on the hypothesis that that position must be maintained that the proposal was put forward that we should try to establish an alternative to Henjam without delay 3 in order that if and when we were obliged to abandon Kenjam hurriedly our position in the Gulf might be maintained without interruption Question number one ini ( the Admiralty memorandum therefore did not seem to affect the main question at issue, which turned on whether we could maintain our position at Henjam in face of the growing Persian opposition* In reply to a question, he explained that our position at Henjam had no legal sanction whatever other than e right to maintain a telegraph station.. maintained CAPTAIh CUhlTIIIGIhU-i said that the ITavy had/a depot at Ken jam during the last tv/enty years, and that Persia had. signified her willingness to e ,ive us a lease of the site, fo notice to quit had 'been given, and our claim to remain seemed therefore quite reasonable* P -:f DfL thought it would ds a great mi stole e to rej_y on such a claim* Persia was at present suffering from a very acute form of the prevailing malady of oriental n^ui^ncfLism* she strongly resented our predominant position in tne Gulf, and more especially our presence on the Persian coast of the Gulf* The Persians had made it clear that they did not admit that we had any legal right to remain in iienjam, and the Persian Minister of Court had some months ago, in a persernd letter to Sir Ih Clive, specifically reserved Persia’s right to object to the use of Persian territory by any foreign Power* If we were to urge that cur presence had been tolerated for many years, the Persian u-oveminent would reply that they could not be held responsible icr the failure of the previous regime to establish its authority over outlying portions of Persian territory, and t' iC 't * eroj-'-oi so/ereign rights over such territory could not be affected by any such failure. If we were to assert that the initiation of negotiations for a lease constituted some hind of recognition of our claim by Persia, the Persians would 1^ not repig Inal those negotiations had broken down* The n orsign Oi„ice did not anticipate however that the Persianshe thought would give us formal notice to quit Hen jam. they might provoke some incident - such, for instance, as the arrest of a British sailor, or a dispute possibly leading to casualties. In the event of any quarrel arising as the result of such an incident, our position would be untenable, .nd re should probably be forced eventually into an ignominious withdrawal. CAPTAIN CUNITIITGHALI considered that should any such incident occur, the Persians would be putting themselves in the wrong and thus playing into our hands. MP» PENPAL in reply to a question as to the position of negotiations regarding a lease for Henjam, said that very little had in fact been achieved. The main difficulty had arisen over the important question of jurisdiction, but actually there were very few points on which agreement had been reached, and there was at present no reason to regard the conclusion of a settlement of this question by negotiation as likely. It appeared, as a result of a recent interview between Sir John Limon and Teymourtache, that the prospects for a resumption of general treaty negotia tions were still unfavourable. MR. HANCOCK pointed out that the Navy maintained no armed forces on shore at Kenjam and that the naval depot Wc..s, he understood, in charge of an Indian storekeeper. Armed men were not landed there, landing parties being simply for recreational purposes. COLONEL MURRAY asked whether Teymourtache’s attitude did not express his personal point of view rataer than the normal views of the Persian Government.-' 4 - MR. RSNDEL considered that the present hostility of Persia to British interests could not be entirely fathered ^ on certain individuals. The recent v.ave of xenophobe nationalism appeared to have affected the whole country more or less. It was useless to talk of taking a 'strong line' in a question such as that of henjam where our position was in fact untenable. The Persians had now learnt to call our bluff* . nd on the whole, as our interests in Persia were considerable, (particularly us regards the A. P. Oo G.) they were in a position to do us more harm than we could do them. In reply to a question as to why it was that the Russians appeared to be able to deal with the Persians so much more favourably than we could, Hr. Rendel explained that the Russians were able for various reasons - geographical Lind other - to put far stronger pressure on Persia then vve were. MR. GRIEVE said that he was surprised at the stress given to the argument that we had no 'legal right' to continue using Hen yam in view of the facts that (a) we had been there some twenty years* (b) no notice to quit had been received, and (c) actual negotiations with the Persian Government for a lease had been opened. He considered that should the Persians provome rm incident they would be placing themselves xn a very unsound position, as the fact that no formal notice to quit had oeen served on us would prove a sound argument on our side. In &lt; ny case we were not using the place as a tar Base, but as a recreation station and stores depot. iH^i oKAIRMAE said that the first two questions in the Admiralty memorandum had been covered by the discussion* and that the question now to be considered was whether we could rely on sufficient notice to quit being given to enable us to prepare another base. come period (apparently fifteen months) was essential before evacuation.- 5 - MR. RENDEL considered that even if such notice were given (which he thought improbable) the period of it would be exceedingly short. As he had previously explained, the Persians were unlikely to admit tnat we had any righto arising out of our long use of the island. ihe Persian Government were now restoring their authority in the outlying districts of Persia and might endeavour to assert that authority against us at Kenjam at any moment* MR. BAXTER pointed out that, if the Persians should decide to secure our removal from Henjam, they would not have to use force. They might possibly proceed in the following way. They night enact legislation which would be ostensibly of general application, but which would in fact be directed against our position at Kenjam. They would then direct their local officials strictly to enforce that legislation. Persian military forces were already stationed in the depot and there was nothing to prevent the Persian garrison from being increased. The result would be that unless we were prepared to use force, it would be impossible for us to continue to use the depot. In reply to a question, he stated that there was in fact an indication that the Persian Government might proceed in this manner. In the course of the recent negotiations, the Persian Minister of Court had shown Sir R. Clive a diaft law regarding the use of Persian territorial waters, and as the result of Sir R. Clive’s remonstrances had stated that the draft law would only be proceeded with if the negotiations broke down. The effect of the possible enforcement of this law at Henjam was uncertain. In any case, objectionable provisions might be added before it was passed by the Persian Parliament. MR. RENDEL suggested that the law might contain strin gent regulations regarding passports, the landing of foreigners, etc.CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM considered that special legislation requiring passports for naval ratings would 'be so opposed to international usage that it could not 'be enforced® Certainly no such 'action was taken by any other civilised power® If the Persians expect to be treated as a civilised Power they must not behave like a primitive tribe* MR* RENPSL explained that it was difficult to foretell exactly what form such Persian legislation might take The Persians were however quite clever enough to devise legislation against the enforcement of which on Persian soil it would be impossible for us to protest, but which it would at the same time be necessary for us to violate if •ve were- to continue to use Hen jam as at present* If such legislation were enacted the Persians might even station armed Persian forces at Henjam in order to secure its enforcement. \fe maintained no garrison at Henjam, and a situation might easily arise where the ere* of a British warship might wish to land at Henjam in the ordinary way and be met by armed resistance on the part of the Persians. In such an event we should either have to withdraw and abandon Henjam at once, or face the possibility of an armed struggle with probable casualties. Such an incident would leave us in an indefensible position internationally. eave usr\ ~~ t in reply to lC\ t iL'JTCOCIC ? in reply to a question as to \7iiat the Navy v/ould do If confronted with armed resistance to the landing of parties 5 said that the Naval party would presumahly return to the ship and instructions would he requested hy wireless. The question then arose as to whether the Cabinet would he prepared to sanction the use of force. T-fS CiulIRK'J. ashed how long the Admiralty would require to develop Bahrein as a naval oort s assuming that money were available, CnPNnL. CUlh;INGHAM said the estimated time was 15 months from the time of the actual commencement of worh. He further suggested that if measures of a discriminatory nature were tahen hy Persia against us 9 the possibility of retalistory action should he considered. In this connection the susceptibility of an island such as Kenjam to naval pressure must he borne in mind, KB. GRIKVm stated that as v;e had been u squatting 1 ’ unchallenged at Henjam for 20 years, we must have acquired some right to reasonable notice being given, if only as a matter of courtesy between civilised people. In his view the case for immediate withdrawal admittedly rested on the hypothesis that the Persians might do something offensive at some future time. He did not thinh His Hajesty's Government should accept an inferior station and incur liability for considerable expenditure on those grounds at present.mmsb mmmmmmmmmmKj a tlRp ANDERSON asNed '.viiGt-iierj If ‘W’e had to leave Henjan without adequate notice* it would not be possible to use Karachi* as a temporary base* until the necessary alterations had been made at Bahrein. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM replied in the affirmative, the question of expense had not however, been considered^ additional port facilities at Karachi and probably one or two additional ships would be necessary- The cost of producing the necessary facilities at Gwadar would also be very considerable, besides which, it was a far less suitable place* Henjam was required, not only because of its position al advantages, but also on account of its relatively favourable climate for recreational purposes© THE CHAIRMAN asked whether there was any prospect of the Persians granting a lease in return for a substantial rental* He noted that the phrase increased rental** was used, but he understood that in point of fact no rent at all was paid at present* KRe RENpEL stated that the Persian objections to our presence at Henjam were mainly political, and that he doubted how far they could be met by financial payments* But assuming that the restricted use of Henjam for a short period could be obtained for a rent of say £2,000, he suggested that it was for consideration whether it would not be better financial policy to incur a capital outlay of say £40,000 (i*e« the capital representing £2,000 at 5^) and thus secure • a permanent base under our own control on the Arabian coast where our real interests lay, rather than a precarious footing on alien territory* - 8 -/-* MR. HANCOCK pointed out that an expenditure of £40 ? 000 at Bahrein would only make the harbour suitable for sloops. To make the harbour usable by a light cruiser y^culd mean an expenditure of some £400 5 000 for dredging purposes® Henjam was, however, usable by light cruisers. MR. GRIBVS said that the Treasury were averse to expenditure on the new station at Bahrein until the situation was clearer® As regards our remaining in Henjam, the primary considerations appeared to be of a political or strategic nature rather than a financial one® The Treasury would, therefore, prefer to pay rent for Henjam up to £2,000 a year, or even mere, for a limited period, than be committed to undefined expenditure elsewhere at an admitted ly inferior station® CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM stressed the climatic advan tages of Ken jam over Bahrein® Hen jam, being at 'che moutn of the Gulf, there is usually a breeze, consequently it is more suitable for health and recreational purposes® At Bahrein, owing to the shallow water which, in hot weather, does not cool even at night, the heat on board ship is intense, so much so that it might at times be impossible even to make ice« The discomfort would be very great and the sick rate, therefore, likely to be high. Additional expenditure for special refrigerating machinery and other fittings to ameliorate the conditions on board ship or on shore would, therefore, probably have to be consideredo MR. RENDEL, Admiralty Memo randue, in the Persian Gulf, was more central for referring to paragraph l r f o? the giving the duties of the Navy said that it appeared that Bahrein the execution of these duties than Henjam®(M) CAPTAIN CUIMMINGVIAaI demurred ? saying that though certain places, notably the Shatt el Arab and Kowelt were closer to Bahrein, likely points of trouble, su,,h as Muscat and the Trucial coast were closer to Hen^am&lt;* GROUP CAPTAIN Phi RUE said that It 'was obvious that from the point of view of the control of the Gull, henjan was the most suitable spot* THE CHAIRMAN asked to what extent financial assistance from India -j as likely to be availaco-e T 'Ro ANDERSON said that the Government of India had agreed to pay half the rent of a lease of Henjam, snoject to a maximum of £500- He had, however, no reason to suppose that the Indian Government would assume the financial burden for the establishment of port facilities at Bahrein- India already pay £ 100,000 per annum towards the upkeep of sloops in the Gulf- The amount of any financial contribution must, of course, be decided by the Government of India who would have to be consulted: MR* HANCOCK pointed out that at present,as far as the Adairsity vere a*erc, the Goverraent of India naintained the chore establishments at HenJam and had met the capital cost of erecting them.I* suggoatedtherefore that the Govern ment of India might meet part of the cost of developing Bahrcino MR* GRIEVE considered thot while the financier aspect was not the main point at ieaue, it must he considered at a later date with the mdia Ofxace vhen 'Me question of policy had oeon decided. MS. ANHSHSOH envisaged the possibility of the Persians re-asserting a claim to Bahrein.MR* RLIJBEL said that while the Persian claim to Bahrein had not been abandoned, the Foreign Office view was that that claim had no substance and that we should be 1 on very strong ground if the question were ever taken to arbitration* MR* GRIEVE pointed out that the fact that the Persians claimed Bahrein and that no arbitral award in our favour had yet been given was a strong argument against the premature transfer of our base to that island- He consid ered that it would be bad policy to spend a large sum on the development of Bahrein until the question of the Persian claim had been disposed of and the question of our rights there had been finally and definitely cleared up* CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM asked whether any concession could be expected from Persia in the event of our agreeing to evacuate Henjamo MR* RENDKL thought none was likely- MRc ANDERSON quoted a despatch from Tehran to the effect that negotiations might possibly be resumed next Spring- He therefore questioned the wisdom of abandoning Henjam forthwith and thus relinquishing any claim we might have there prior to negotiations being undertaken* As regards the question of prestige, with which the India Offic were somewhat intimately concerned, they had originally thought that less loss of face would be involved if we were to abandon Henjam voluntarily- They were, however, impressed by the arguments put forward by the Admiralty in paragraph 4 of their Memorandum, to the effect that withdrawal under any conditions must involve a loss of prestigey MR* BAXTER demurred-; as ho cone ids:?-© a tnar if we v^iT-hdrew after announcing our intention to do co ; any loss of prestige must 1c less than if we were obviously to 'be fox*oed by the Persians to leave. Once we had announced our intention to prepare a new naval depot at Bahrein, the withdrawal would be attributed to our wish to strengthen our position on the Arab Coast. IE. GP.1K7E said that should we as the result of Persian pressure abandon Honjam, it seemed very probable that a demand would follow to the effect that we nus-c not settle down at Bahrein. 'He should be unwise to incur capital expenditure while the solution remained uncertain. The abandonment of Henjan in advance of a notice to quit might well encourage the Persians to pursue their advantage while the going appeared to be good. Referring to paragraph 10 of tne Admiralty memorandum, MR. RENDSL explained that in tire Foreign Office view there was not the remotest hope of Persia ever agreeing to the use of Henjam as an air base. Ac regards its use by imperial Airways, the whole difficulty connected with the air route was due to Persian objections to the use of Persian territory on the coast of the Gulf by Bntisn aircraft. That difficulty would not be met by substituting the use of Henjam for the use of the stopping places on the present South Persian route* THE CHAIRMAN said that the question to be settled could be summed up very briefly as whether we should leave Henjam now, or wait upon developments. The Admiralty, both for reasons of strategy and practical convenience wish to continue the use of Henjam as a fuelling ana recreational station for His Majesty’s ships In the Gulf. On the other- 13 - hendo the Foreign Office^ for diplomatic and pclitioal reasons^ *ere convinced that it vas desirable that vva should abandon it before the Persians made any move in the matter® The other departments represented on the Sub committee which were at all concerned in this particular auestion 5 appeared to be on the side of the Admiralty* Here were two conflicting points of view which could not be reconciled by the Official Sub-Committee and a reference to the Ministerial Sub-Ccmnittec oas, therefore, necessary* He suggested that a memorandum should be drafted, out lining the history of the matter and giving the arguments for, and against, remaining at Henjam* This could then be presented to the Ministerial Sub—Committee who would be asked to take a decision* CONCLCSIOff* 1.1 was agree g.• to instruct the Secretary, in conjunction with the representatives of the Admiralty and the Foreign Ctfioe, to prepare a memorandum for submission to the Ministerial Sub-Committee, outlining the history of tns case and giving the arguments for and against the continuance of the use of Henjam as a fuelling and recreational station for naval forces in the Persian Gulf® 2 , Whitehall Cardens, SoWo 1 , 17th Pecember, 1931®(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0?

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4979/841/34] No. 1. Foreign Office to Admiralty. (Secret.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 28, 1931. WITH reference to the conclusions of the meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee held on the 18th August to discuss the position with regard to the naval station at Henjam, in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Marquess of Reading to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lords Commis sioners of the Admiralty, the accompanying copy of a despatch(') under cover of which Lord Reading transmitted the record of this meeting to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, together with a copy of Mr. Dodd’s reply.( 2 ) 2. Their Lordships will observe that Mr. Dodd is in entire agreement with the conclusion reached by the meeting, to the effect that there is little, if any, prospect, in present circumstances, of a satisfactory arrangement being reached with Persia regarding the lease of Henjam. He feels, moreover, that there is a serious danger lest the Persian Government should force His Majesty’s Govern ment by indirect means to withdraw from Henjam as soon as they learn the value of Henjam to themselves, which will presumably be soon after the arrival in the Gulf of the new Persian navy. In these circumstances, Mr. Dodd submits that the preparation of an alternative naval station, at Bahrein or elsewhere, has become a matter of urgent necessity. 3. Lord Reading does not propose at the present stage to consider the further but less important question raised in Mr. Dodd’s despatch with regard to the manner in which His Majesty’s Government should announce their intention of constructing a naval depot elsewhere than at Henjam. He directs me, however, to explain in this connexion that the general sense of the relevant passage of Mr. Lascelles’s private telegram No. 165 of the 27th July, referred to in paragraph 9 of the present despatch, is to the effect that a simultaneous announcement of the proposed withdrawal should be made as soon as possible on the Arab coast and to the Persian Government. Mr. Lascelles pointed out tha.t the Persian Government would do much to diminish the prestige of His Alajesty’s Government in the Gulf, and that any suspicion on their part that they were about to lose the tactical advantages derived from the weakness of the British position at Henjam would almost certainly lead to a strong and public demand on their part that Hen jam should immediately be evacuated It was desirable, if the prestige of His Alajesty’s Government were not to be impaired unduly, that such an evacuation should be voluntary, and should not appear to have been directly caused by Persian pressure. In these circumstances, Mr. Lascelles proceeded, it was essential to maintain absolute secrecy so long as the possibilities of constructing an alternative depot elsewhere were being examined. As soon as a decision was reached, however, it should be followed by a widespread announce ment on the Arab coast of the intentions of His Alajesty’s Government as communicated to the Persian Government. 4. While the procedure suggested in the preceding paragraph need not be discussed further at the present stage, I am to express the hope that their Lordships will give the most serious and urgent consideration to the other suggestions advanced in Air. Dodd’s despatch. Lord Reading entirely shares Air. Dodd’s view that it is now essential to begin the preparations for an alternative British depot elsewhere than at Henjam. The weakness of the British position at Henjam weakens correspondingly the whole position of His Alajesty’s Government vis-d-vis of the Persian Government and, indeed, their whole position in the Persian Gulf. I am to draw their Lordships’ special attention to the developments reported in Mr. Dodd’s telegram No. 229 of the 7th October, and connected correspondence, with regard to the demand of the Persian local (!) September 7, 1931, Section 1. ( 2 ) October 2, 1931, Section 1. [281 ee—1]authorities for the removal of the British naval flagstaff at Henjam, which, as Mr. Dodd points out, is typical of the pressure which the Persian Government could bring to bear to make the British position at Henjam untenable. As their Lordships are aware, His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to resist effectively such Persian pressure, however damaging to British prestige in the^* Gulf, and it is, in Lord Reading’s opinion, of urgent importance that His Majesty’s Government shall endeavour to free themselves as soon as possible from the grave disadvantages and dangers inherent in the present anomalous situation. 5. In these circumstances, Lord Reading considers essential that an urgent decision be reached with regard to the practicability of Bahrein as the site ot an alternative depot to Henjam, and that the full estimates of cost required by the Treasury be prepared with the least possible delay. 6. His Lordship will be glad to receive at your early convenience their Lordships’ considered opinion on the points raised in this letter and in Mr. Dodd’s despatch. 7. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Air Ministry, Colonial Office, India Office, Treasury and War Office. I am, &amp;c. G. W. RENDEL.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNMENT PERSIA. September 7, 1931. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4362/841/34] No. 1. The Marquess of Reading to Mr. Dodd {Tehran). (No. 512. Secret.) Sir, Foreign Office, September 7, 1931. I TRANSMIT to you the accompanying copy of the minutes of a meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee held^ on the 18th August to consider the position at Henjam.( l ) 2. In considering the desirability of an early transfer of the naval station to Bahrein, the meeting was greatly influenced by the opinion expressed by Sir R. Clive in paragraph 5 of his despatch No. 343 of the. 28th June, to the effect that the Persian Government are unlikely to force an issue over the question ot Hen jam. The view was taken by the representatives of some Departments at the meeting that, if it is the fact that the Persian Government will never force an issue at Henjam, it is unnecessary, unless and until Sir R. Clive’s opinion is shown by future developments to have been over-optimistic, to proceed with the removal of the British Naval Depot from Persian territory. 3. While I do not desire to question the considered opinion of Sir R. Clive, I feel that the unlikelihood of the Persian Government openly demanding the withdrawal of the British Naval Depot from Henjam, and referring the matter to the League of Nations, is not a factor in the situation of vital importance in connexion with the immediate issue under discussion by the meeting. The Persian Government appear to have little need to have recourse to such drastic and offensive methods, when they can at any time, if they so desire, bring about the withdrawal of the British Naval Depot by other and less militant means, e.g., by introducing and enforcing restrictive regulations, and thereby making the position so difficult for the British naval authorities concerned that they will have no alternative but to leave Henjam and make arrangements elsewhere. The position of His Majesty's Government at Henjam appears, indeed, so weak that it would be impossible to maintain it in the face of a serious Persian attempt to bring about the withdrawal of the British depot. 4. The main question for immediate consideration Is whether or not there remains any hope of regularising the position by agreement with the present or any future Persian Government, or of any future Persian Parliament being willing to ratify it. The negotiations for a general treaty are at present theoreti cally only suspended, but I am not aware of any circumstance which renders it likely that, if and when negotiations are resumed, the Persian Government will in future be more amenable with regard to the desiderata of His Majesty s Govern ment as embodied in the draft Henjam protocol. On the contrary, in view of the impending arrival in the Gulf of the new Persian navy, possibly in the course of the next few months, there is every likelihood that the distaste with which the Persian Government view the unauthorised and irregular use by the war vessels of a foreign Power of the best anchorage in Persian waters will increase to such an extent as to render a crisis inevitable. 5. If, therefore, on the one hand there is little or no prospect of ever regularising the position at Henjam by agreement with Persia, and if, on the other, it is only a question of time, and possibly only of months, before the Persian Government oblige His Majesty’s Government to withdraw from Henjam, it appears most desirable that the withdrawal shall take place as soon as possible, and not under pressure from the Persian Government. 6. In these circumstances I shall be glad to receive at an early date your observations on the whole question and more especially on the point whether the moment has now come when His Majesty’s Government should regard as a matter of urgency the transfer to Bahrein of the naval station at Henjam with the least O •/ possible delay.

Mr. Dodd to the Marquess of Reading.—{Received October 2.) (No. 523. Secret.) My Lord, Tehran, September 22, 1931. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s Secret despatch No. 512 of the 7th September, in which you ask me for my views upon the position at Henjam. 2. I do not consider that for the present the Persian Government are likely to put forward an open demand for evacuation, although they may, in anticipation of the resumption of treaty negotiations, embark upon a policy of pinpricks designed to remind His Majesty’s Government of the precarious nature of their position. The desire of His Majesty’s Government to remain at Henjam offers them a most useful weapon in treaty negotiations, and until these negotiations are resumed they would gain no advantage by throwing this weapon away unnecessarily. They might, of course, be unable to refrain from action in the event of some local incident occurring in which their amour-propre was involved, and which received sufficient publicity. But, for the moment at any rate, they do not appear to be seeking pretexts for making trouble. They have, for instance, contented themselves, so far as can be seen, with a paper protest regarding the four slaves who took refuge on board His Majesty’s ship “ Folkestone ” (see my despatch No. 500 of the 21st September). The fact that the ship’s officers were in the right would not have deterred them from making use of this incident had it suited them to do so. 3. It is unlikely, moreover, that either the original status quo agreement with regard to the Gulf, or the later and more general assurance given by Teymourtache when negotiations were broken off, would deter the Persian Government from raising the question of Henjam if they thought it opportune. Teymourtache’s assurance in particular is of a somewhat flimsy kind. The Persian Government might plausibly claim that the first was come to in con templation of the early conclusion of negotiations and the second in contemplation of an early resumption of negotiations, and that as, in fact, the negotiations have been neither resumed nor concluded, neither agreement is now valid. The inter pretation which they place upon the agreement in respect of the forcible nationalisation and conscription of Bahreinis suggests that they would have no hesitation in claiming that the application to Henjam of general measures in force before the agreement, but not previously applied there, would be no breach of the agreement. They have already, in fact, raised difficulties about such matters as the importation of supplies for the coal coolies, and, quite recently, for residents in the concession generally; and the employment of Persian subjects as bakers or washermen. This, if it is not due to mere ineptitude (compare the reasons for the closure of the Duzdap Railway), may be intended, as I have indicated above, to emphasise the weakness of His Majesty’s Government's position and their dependence on Persian goodwill, but it is probably not intended deliberately to render the position intolerable. Finally, the Persian Government might claim that the closure of the Duzdap Railway was itself a breach of the status quo entitling them to break it at Henjam. The weakness of the argu ment would not deter them from using it. 4. In these circumstances it is clear that if the Persian Government make no move to secure evacuation, it is because they do not choose to do so. This, however, is not an indication of the strength of His Majesty’s Government’s position, but of the reverse. It is because the Persian Government know that this position is weak that they are content to wait upon events in the hope of exploiting it to the full when negotiations are resumed. 5. The situation will alter considerably if, in the course of the negotiations, the Persian Government decide that the inducements which His [281 b—1]J Majesty’s Government have to offer for the grant of a lease at Henjam are not after all sufficiently attractive. This may well happen, for apart frnni the transfer of the Duzdap Railway, which is already earmarked, so to speak, for the southern air route (a point hitherto at least outside the treaty) and the remission of the war and post-war debt, which the Persian Government do not intend to pay in any case, His Majesty’s Government have little that is tangible to offer. Unless, therefore, some fresh inducement were forthcoming, the Persian Government might quite easily begin by making minor difficulties at Henjam in the hope of exerting pressure, and end by declaring that no lease could be granted. 6. Although it is still not possible to state exactly when negotiations will be resumed, it is not unreasonable to expect that this will be before next spring, when the first units of the Persian navy are expected to reach the Gulf. Once this happens, the situation will be still more radically changed. It is most unlikely that the Persian Government yet realise the full value of Henjam. But the measure of its importance for His Majesty’s Government is the measure of the importance which it may soon assume for the Persian Government. When that day comes they will, without question, set to work to secure Henjam for them selves, unless they are already bound by an agreement which effectively precludes this. It is, unfortunately, impossible to guarantee that the negotiations, even if they began to-day, would be finished by next spring, and it is equally impossible to guarantee that, even if they w r ere finished, the agreement regarding Henjam would be unassailable. 7. Assuming for the moment that the Persian Government were disposed in principle to grant a lease at Henjam, I can see little prospect of the terms of that lease being more favourable than those contained in the latest Persian drat of the Henjam Protocol. It is even possible that the Persian Government may withdraw much that they may have already offered, and that the negotiation of even the most unsatisfactory lease would involve much delay and many conces sions. But even with the present Persian draft there can be no real security. It gives the Persian Government too many opportunities to render the position there intolerable whenever they begin to covet the anchorage for themselves. Nothing short of the British draft enclosed in Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 368 of the 29th July, 1930, including the original form of article 6 regarding jurisdiction in the concession, will provide adequate security. The amended form of this article suggested to Teymourtache on the 28th July, 1930, would, I fear, offer no sufficient guarantee. The prospects of securing the acceptance of the British draft are, however, exceedingly remote, and even if it were accepted there could never be any guarantee, in the case of the Persian Government, that its terms would be faithfully carried out. I do not think that the present Persian Government would have any difficulty in securing tiie ratification by the Majlis of any agreement of which they approved, though they might use the Majlis as an excuse for the rejection of any agreement of which they subsequently repented. 8. Your Lordship will not wish me to repeat the general arguments for a withdrawal from Henjam which have, if I mav venture to say so, been fully and adequately expressed by the representatives of the Foreign Office and India Office at the Committee of Imperial Defence Sub-Committee meeting held on the 18th August. I will only repeat that Henjam is the biggest liability on the British side of the negotiations, while withdrawal w^ould not in any way constitute an asset, as the repiesentatives of some departments at the meeting appeared to think. If the British negotiator enters the discussions with the knowledge that there is no alternative to Henjam and that a lease must be secured at all costs, he must be prepared to give w r ay on most of the other points wdiich the Persian negotiator may bring forward, and to concede everything which the Persian nego tiator may ask with regard to the details of the' lease itself. If, on the other hand, he can enter the discussions with the knowledge that, though Henjam may be the most desirable site, an alternative can none the less be made available, he can take the line that if the Persian Government are unwilling to grant a lease except on fantastic terms, His Majesty s Government are unwilling to be black mailed and will withdraw altogether. It is just possible that, rather than lose their weapon altogether, the Persian Government might consent to a lease on reasonable terms, which would preclude the possibility of a forced withdrawal even when the Persian navy felt the need for Henjam for itself * -. 9 ‘ ^ 1 an A not cl ^ ar a , s t0 how far the preparations at Bahrein could be carried forward without the fact that they were being undertaken coming to the3 knowledge of the Persian Government. But unless it is certain that complete secrecy could be observed, it would be necessary to announce in advance the intention to transfer the depot (see Mr. Lascelles's telegram No. 165 of the 27th July). In the case of the Persian Government openly demanding evacuation, the prestige of His Majesty’s Government would, of course, be more adequately protected if they could point to the fact that they had already begun to prepare a site elsewhere as proof that they had already decided to leave Hen]am of their own accord, than if no such preparations had been begun. But this would not be so satisfactory as forestalling the Persian Government altogether. A definite announcement by His Majesty’s Government of their intention to with draw would not, however, necessarily make it impossible for them, if treaty negotiations were resumed before any large sum had been expended at Bahrein or elsewhere, to place Hen jam on the agenda of the negotiations, explaining that though a move to Bahrein had been decided upon they were, nevertheless, prepared to retain Hen jam if a reasonable rent and reasonable conditions could be agreed upon. But this could not be done unless the completion of the site at Bahrein within a reasonable period could be counted upon as an absolute certainty. Even, moreover, if a satisfactory lease at Hen jam were achieved by these means, it would still, in my opinion, be desirable to keep the Bahrein site in reserve in case it should prove impossible towards the end of the twenty-five years lease to negotiate a renewal on satisfactory terms. 10. My conclusions are, therefore, that it would be unwise to count upon any more satisfactory agreement than the present Persian draft of the Hen jam Protocol; that in this form the protocol, even if His Majesty's Government were to accept it, would not prevent the Persian Government from forcing the withdrawal of His Majesty's Government by indirect means when once they learned the value of Hen jam to themselves; that they will unquestionably learn this value when the Persian navy arrives in the Gulf or very shortly afterwards; that if the Persian navy arrives before an agree ment has come into force, the Persian Government are likely at the least to wish to share the anchorage and may w T ell break off negotiations and put forward an open demand for withdrawal; that in these circumstances the preparation of an alternative site, at Bahrein or elsewhere, is a matter of urgent necessity; that provided this is put in hand, but not otherwise, the British negotiator may, with some prospect of success, seek to secure a lease at Hen jam satisfactory in itself and secure against future encroachments; and that whether the latter point is decided on or not, an announcement of His Majesty’s Government’s intention to construct a depot elsewhere is desirable, if there is any danger of leakage, before active preparations are begun and, in any circumstances, before negotiations are resumed or the Persian navy reaches the Gulf. 11. lam well aware that the obstacle to this policy is the financial one. So far as the cost of transferring the depot to Bahrein is concerned, the expenditure required for a new site has, I believe, been estimated at about £30,000. For this a permanent site could be secured. At Henjam, on the other hand, His Majesty s Government are prepared to pay in the last resort £1,000 a year for twenty-five years. Apart, therefore, from the fact that the Bahrein proposal involves the payment of a lump sum at a time of great financial stringency, it appears upon the whole to be a profitable investment. But even if the sum involved were considerably larger, I should still consider withdrawal from Henjam as an imperative necessity, if the risk of a severe blow to the prestige of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf is to be avoided. 12. With regard to the further question of the additional expenditure which might be involved if preparations for a depot were to be begun at Bahrein and a lease of the site at Henjam were subsequently acquired, I wish to make it Hear that the suggestion that, even though preparations might have been begun at Bahrein the British negotiator should still attempt to secure a lease at Henjam, is purely subsidiary. The important point is that His Majesty’s Government should be ready, and able, to withdraw from Henjam when necessary. 13. I venture to add that I have written this despatch on the assumption that the present Government, or Governments of a similar complexion, will remain in power. If the entire regime were to change, it is possible that a friendlier Government might be anxious to please His Majesty’s Government by making things easy at Henjam, or a weaker one be unable to take effective action to prevent their continued occupation. But I consider that such changes are toospeculative to be taken into account in this connexion Moreover, any future Government that possessed a navy would be obliged, so far as I can see, to atta : the same importance as the present one may be expected to do to the possession ot Heniam as an anchorage for its own use.

IMMEDIATE ANN SECRET. M. 02613/31. 7th December, 1931. Sir, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of tho Admiralty to refer to your letter E.4979/841/34 of 28th October concerning the question of the removal of the British naval depot at Henjam. In view of the impracticability of withdrawal from Henjam at short notice and the difficulties connected with the establishment of an alternative base. My Lords have caused the accompanying memorandum on the general situation in the Persian Gulf from the naval point of view to be prepared and They propose that, if the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs concurs, the question should be considered in the first instance by the Standing Official Sub—Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, A copy of this letter has been sent to the India Office, Treasury, Air Ministry, War Office and Colonial Office 0 I am, etc. , (Signed) ALEX FLINT. The Under-Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1.- 1 - AmTPAL?Y p^nvAL OP THE BRITIoK MMk Aj-TT) THE PRACTICABILITY 0p AIp_A LTLP-l-ITTIVE,BE. The Foreign Office view, as stated in their letter of 28th October, 1931, that it is now essential to begin the preparations for an alternative British naval depot olsewdiere than at Hen jam, and the difficulties end disadvantages connected with such a transxer, make io desirable to review the situation in the Persian ^1- the naval point cf view. ip the first instance it is necessary to state that withdrawal from Henjam at very short notice is quite impracticable without a considerable reduction in the number of ships maintained in the Gulf in view ot tne practical difficulties of working from a base outside the Gulf and the time that.it will take to make available th* only suitable alternative base, Bahrein* 3. The Admiralty do not, however, consider that, the case for immediate preparations for withdrawal from Henjam has been fully established, and in view of the great advantages of Henjam over any possible alternative base, * they consider that it is desirable in any case to suay there as long as possible. 4, The Tehran despatch of 22nd Geptembcr, 1931, which forms the enclosure to Foreign Office letter of 28th October, reports no new circumstances to support the view that withdrawal at short notice is inevitable. The main argument appears to be the great less of prestige that would result if we waited for a definite demand from Persia that we should withdraw or for the series of local pinpricks, alleged to be inevitable, that would make cur position there intolerable and force us to withdraw. The Admiralty consider that withdrawal under any conditions must involve a loss of s &lt;^ PP ^'- 2 - (S^) prestige and that there would he no substantial difference if we now withdraw without pressure from Persia, as it would he quite clear that we were going as a result of the Persian attitude to our prolonged attempts to get a satisfactory lease, 5 0 As this country has always recognised Persian sovereignty over the island of Henjam 5 the Admiralty do not consider that the le~s of prestige in removing as the result of a demand from Persia would he so serious as is suggested, provided, of course, that we do not agree to withdraw at very short notice and before an alternative base is available, 6 „ The Admiralty do not understand why it is suggested that Persia may force us to leave at very short notice, Persia has no force capable of compelling us to do so and it is unlikely that she would make any such attempt. If she docs, there would be no difficulty in meeting 3t, but there is little doubt that she would only attempt to get us out by diplomatic methods, accompanied by pinpricks. The diplomatic methods must take a considerable time and the pinpricks can probably all be effectively handled by the S.lhCh, particularly if we have decided to move and are no longer anxious to keexj on good terms with the local authorities in order to avoid prejudicing negotiations in progress. As Persia has acquiesced in our position at lien jam for a considerable number of years and has been negotiating a least with us for about 2 years, we would have good g] ounds for objecting to a demand for us to go at very short, notice, Ve can well say they h. d accepted the principle of a lease and it was only a question of its terms. We would therefore probably be able to insist on the necessary period make fresh arrangements at any time that■hmhrrpwbbmm Persia definitely given us notice to move. Moreover, a temporary arrangement for the ^oint use of Kcn.’iam should he practicable if Persia were anxious to get early use of the base for her own ships, as our representative at Tehran anticipates* 7« In view of the great advantages of IIenjam from strategic and clirnacic points of view, the Admiralty are very reluctant to acquiesce in any withdrawal* Moreover, they consider that, if we withdraw, there may be a danger of Persia leasing it at a later date to some other European Power, possibly Italy, who will shortly obtain a special position vis-a-vis Persia through her officers being in command of the new Persian war vessels. Oil. 4 representative at Tehran apparently still considers it just possible that the present Persian Government may yet be reasonable end grant us a suitable lease,, Even if we cannot get a suitable lease from this Government, the Admiralty thinh that we may be able to carry on more or loss as at present until a change of Government takes place, 6, The advantages of Henjam and the cost of a suitable alternative base, which is dealt with in paras* E5 - 28, would in the opinion of the Admiralty justify some much more substantial financial inducements being offered to Persia than have so far been contemplated. The maximum so far suggested is a rent of £2,000 per annum* There are grounds for considering that the offer of a substantial lump sum in return for a suitable long term lease, with provision for renewal, would be justified, 9° In this connection the Admiralty would draw attention to the possibility of Imperial Airways using Henjam as a night stopping place for their service to India in lieu of some place on the Truciai Coast, which in the opinion- 4 - of the Admiralty involves serious risk of extensive commitments, as has already 'been pointed out m paper No. M.2.(M) 8, and in any case will necessitate considerable expenditure that would he avoided hy the use of Henjam. 10. Ilenjarn would also appear to offer the most advan tageous base for R.A.F. flying boats operating in the Southern end of the Gulf, 11. The Admiralty see no strong objections to staying at Henjam as long as possible in the hope of ultimately obtaining a suitable lease. There would be no necessity to let Persia blackmail us as really objectionable conditions need not be accepted. An alternative base can be made whenever we are prepared to incur tne expen diture of the substantial sum involved and it is to be hoped that later we shall be better able to afford this. IP. The Admiralty do not concur in the suggestion that the preparation of an alternative base should be proceeded with in order to facilitate the negotiations of &amp; lease of hen jam.. Such a course is considered objectionable from a financial point of view and there would also appear to be political objections to making the necessary arrangements with the Sheikh of Bahrein and starting the work if it were not quite definite that they were to be proceeded with. 18. The Admiralty do not agree that it is practically certain that Persia will want us to clear out of Henjam because she will want it for her own Navy. It is thought quite likely that the Persian Navy will in a. he its head quarters at some much more civilised spot and possibly put to sea less and less frequently. It has already been reported that it will be based on Bushire and have barracks■■■■■■ S^l on shore there j Even it they want to use henjam occasionally /they might like us to maintain a depot there they can use and we might then arrange some agree ment on the lines of the Vei-hai-V/ei agreement with China* 14. In order to appreciate the importance of a satisfactory 'base in the G-ulf y it Is necessary oo con sider why we maintain a squadron there* 15. British interests in the Persian Qulf date from the year 1616 find political control has been exercised consistently from ahout the year 1763 when the Busnire Residency was established. Throughout this period the need for the maintenance of naval forces in the Persian Gulf in peace to support the Political Resident has been demonstratedo 16o Hitherto no foreign Power has maintained a naval force in the waters of the Persian Gull^ Comparatively minor British naval forces have* therefore^ in normal times been sufficient to afford the necessary support to the Political Re si dent« This state of affairs is :&gt; however, now drawing to a close© The Persian Governmono has purchasedj and will in the near future establish in the Persian Gulf, a small squadron of naval vessels; it seems probable, and this opinion is shared by the British Minister at Tehran, (vide Tehran letter Ho. 386 of G3rd July, 1931), that the arrival of this force in the Gulf will give rise to serious additional difficulties© Prom the political point of view, therefore, the need for maintaining a British force in Persian Gulf waters is likely to be considerably increased in the near future* un additional factor increasing the importance of maintaining our naval position in the Gulf is the development of the air route to India©6 17 0 The duties falling in time of peace upon the Navy in the Gulf may he summarised as followsj- (1) To maintain our position in the Gulf generally and prevent any foreign country from having an t ' convincing reason for attempting to obtain a footing in the Gulf* (2) To uphold our special position vis-a-vis the sheikhs of Kcweit, Muscat, Bahrein and of the Trueini Coasto (3) To collect news and intelligence,, ( 4 V ) To co-operate with the Royal Air Force* ( 5 ) To suppress piracy* (6) To suppress the slave traffic, ( 7 ) To suppress illicit arms traffic,, (8) To check tribal hostilities at sea 0 (9) To convey and support our Political Officers as is so frequently necessary or the Arab coast-o (10) To safeguard British trade in the Gulfc (11) To safeguard British oi. 1 . interests* (12) To preserve order on tne pearl conks during the pearling season in the summer, (13) To visit the Shalt—a!~'Arab to main tain o.er amongst the large number of dhows there curing the date loading season, IS* In ware, in addition to the above, control of the Persian oil export and assistance in maintaining the strategic air route to India would be important responsibilities falling upon the navy,, ig o Experience has shown that the performance 01 these duties necessitates the maintenance continuously in- Persian Gulf waters of a minimum force of 3 vessels 5 indeed, the Indian Government^ contribution of £100,000 per annum is made on the distinct understanding that there will always be 3 ships operating in the vicinity of the Gulf, 20* Maintenance in any particular area of a’given force of warships is dependent upon the total number of vessels7 vessels available and upon the relative situation of the 'base from which those ships cperate c The nearer the 'base to ^ the area of operations, the less will 'be the time wasted 'by vessels in visiting the 'base for the purpose of replenishing fuel and stores and for the recuperation of the ships 1 companies, and the less therefore V?lill he the total number of vessels neededc In the past, an adequate operational base for the vessels cf the Persian Gulf Squadron has been available at Henjam and it has therefore only been necessary for the vessels of this squadron to quit their area of onerations for the purpose of docking and repairs, which could only be carried out at Bombay and Colombo e In these circumstances a force of 4 ships has proved adequate for the maintenance within the area of operations of the minimum cf 5 vessels,. Sic It is clear that the evacuation of Henjam would necessitate either the provision of an alternative base elsewhere in the Gulf or the utilisation of an existing base outside the area of operations of the Persian Gulf squadron. The nearest bases outside the Gulf which are suitable or could be made suitable are Bombay and Karachi. Bombay is approximately 1100 miles and Karachi about 600 miles from the Strait of Orinu.?, Using Karachi, the nearer of these two, would entail the ships of the Persian Gulf,squadron operating from a base some 2 days steaming from their area of operations. 22 c Past experience has shown that, in view of the extremely trying climate of the Gulf and the lack of recreational facilities for the crews :&gt;.f the ships employed therein, it has been desirable that ships should spend approximately 70 days per aiamum at Hen jam where the necessary recreational facilities for the men have been provided. In view of the additional steaming entailed by operating from a base so far removed from their area of operations, it is probableprobable that the maintenance of health *culd render it desirable that shios should spend a longer, ratner than a less, period at Karachi if the health of the crews is to be maintained. Assuming, however, that the period required will only be that found necessary in the past while using Henjam, then each ship'of the Persian Gulf squadron would require to be absent from its area of operations for some ten weeks in each year. To this must be added the three months per annum at present spent refitting and docking at Colombo and Bombay respectively* ha eh ship would, therefore, be absent from the xersian Gulf proper for approximately siB weens in each year. 23. It is clear, therefore, that the substitution of Karachi for Henjam as the operational base for the vessels of the X J ersian Gulf squadron would necessitate the employment of at least one, ana probably two, additional vessels in order to maintain 3 vessels in the operational area. The cost of this addition would ox 1 course be very considerable and to it must be added the cost of the additional fuel expended in visiting the new operational base for the purpose of replenishing fuel and stores. 24. Apart from the extra cost, there is the additional disadvantage that a considerable loss of efficiency would result frem the fact that vessels recuperating at the base would be far removed from the area of operations. This consideration is very important as regards the Trucial Coast, tae area in which serious incidents are likely to arise suddenly and require reinforcements. 25. If it were decided to move to Bahrein and to proceed at once with the works proposed by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the admiralty estimate that the tine required to complete them would be at least fifteen months - 3 - —~ 9 ~ &amp;nd the cost at lcc&gt;st ? COO to ^4:0,OCG• These figures include tne coot 01 iund.* They are* of course^ provisional and are based largely on local estimates which may be found to be low. It must also be remembered that as the construction and use of the base proceeds^ further requirements beyond those at present ashed for may be found to be necessary. The estimate for the cost assumes that the work will be done by the Admiralty and that a special supervising staff is sent out for the purpose. If the cost falls on Havy Votes, the item will be a Part 1 service requiring Treasury sanction and will entail special financial orovision under Vote 1C in this year and to complete in 1938, T6. If the work, however, is to proceed as a normal charge to Navy Votes for which no additional and special financial provision can be made, it is most improbable that it 11 bo possible to find room for it in tne estimates for 1938, in view of the limited funds available and the heavy demands already made upon them« If it can be included at all, it is certain that no more than a small sum could be provided, with the result that the work could not be started till late in the summer of 1932. It is more probable that it would have to be deferred altogether and considered next year for commencement in 1933. 27. The Admiralty point out, however, that they have no Civil Engineering Staff in the Persian Gulf and they understand that any new works or repairs required there are carried cut by the Public Works Department of the Government of India as a charge to IndianVotes. It is/^herefore for consideration whether any work found necessary at Bahrein should not be carried out by and as a charge to the Government of India, who would in that case no doubt desire to prepare their own28. Somewhat similar coneiderations apply at Henjam If any lump sum payment is to he made for a long term concession at Henjam, how far will the cost fall on India and the United Kingdom respectively'.'' It will be recalled that it was provisionally agreed that the rent of Henjam should be shared equally between India and the United Kingdom. As regards the United Kingdom share, it will be necessary to decide on which votes it will fall. Presumably on the Service Departments and in that case it is for consideration how fur Air Force votes should contribute. Any considerable addition to Navy Vote 10 will require special financial provision over and above the amounts on which Navy Estimates for 1932 are at present being framed, 29, Uhe conclusion is that the Admiralty are firmly opposed to any withdraw1 from Henjum because of its great advantages as a naval base over any other place in the Gulf, of the fact tnat the Navy has now used it for 20 year with the tacit acquiescence of Persia, of the very bad effect on British prestige that will result from withdrawal, and of the substantial expenditure necessary to make Bahrein, the only practicable alternative P suitable. 30. The following appear to be the main questions that require a decision: 1, Is the special British position in the Gulf, and particularly our position vis-a-vis the Arab.rulers now in treaty relations with us to bo maintained? 2, Is there any real need to consider having to withdraw from Henjam either at short notice or at all? 5, Gould we not insist on remaining there, after Persia has given us formal notice to withdraw, for-11- * « r 5o 8 the period (cit le&amp;st 15 in.on.ths) necesodxy to establish an alternative base? Naval opinion is unanimous that Henjam offers advantages incomparably greater than those of any other base. Do these advantages justify the offer to Persia of a much higher rent and possibly a lump sum in addition? To what figure are the Sub committee prenared to recommend the Government to go? V/hat share would India accept of an increased rent or lump sum payment for Henjam? Can the expenditure of a sum oi the order of £38,000 to £40,000 to make Bahrein suitable be accepted, now if the answers to 2 and 4 are in the affirmative, or when it becomes clear that withdrawal from Hen jam is necessary*? Would India undertake the work and defray the expenditure required at Bahrein and the cost of maintenance? Is the transfer to Bahrein so urgent that the work there must be done at once and a special grant made by Treasury ^or India), or can it wait and take its turn with other important new works? If India does not defray tne cost, will any part fall on hir Force Votes? ADMIRALTY. December, 1931oV w X d ^'V-nO ?th Deoember, M.02013/31.

Ml LAX L M*. tiiMlkUk&amp;k p£*saL*L.mMM The Foreign Office Tiew, as stated in their letter of 28th October, 1931, that it ie now eeBential to begin the preparations for an alternative Britieh naval depot ed sewhere than at Hen jam, anc; the difficultiee and disadvantages connected with such a transfer, aaXe it desirable to review the situation in the Persian Gulf from the naval point of view, £« In Lhe first instance it is necessary to state that withdrawal from Hen^Jam at very short notice Is quite 1 ■practicable without a considerable reduction in uhe number of ship© maintained in the Gulf in view of the practical difficulties of working from a base outside the Gulf and the time that it will take to make available the only suitable alternative base, Bahrein, 3, The Admiralty do not, howtver, consider that the case for immediate preparations for withdrawal from Hen^aa has been fully established, and in view of the great advantages of H^njam over any poseible alternative base, they consider that it is desirable in any case to stay there as long as possible* 4* The Tehran despatch of 22nc September, 1931, which fora© the enclosure to Foreign Office letter of 28th October, reports no new circumstances to support the view vOiat withdrawal at short notice is inevitable. The main argument appears to be the great loss of prestige that would result if we waited for a definite demand from Persia that we should withdraw or for the series of local pinpricks, alleged to be inevitable, that would make our position there intolerable and force us to withdraw. The Admiralty consider that withdrawal under any concition© mu&amp;t Involve a loss of prestigePWPOMM— ■H - 8 - preetige and thai. there would be no eubatantlal difference if we now withdraw without preeeure froia i ersia, ae it would be quite clear that we were going &amp;&amp; a xiesult of the rerbian attitude to our pz^olonged atteapta to get a satisfactory liuee* b* As this country has always recognised vtrsian sovereignty over the island of Ktn^aa t the Adair&amp;lty do not consider that the loss of prestige in renoving as the result of a demand from Persia would be so serious as is suggested f provided, of course, that we do not agree to withdraw at very short notice and before an alternative base is available* 6* fhm Admiralty do not understand why it is sugHee'ted that 5 ersia may force us to leave at very short notice* Persia has no force capable of compelling us to do so and it is unlikely that she would make any such attempt* If she does, ther would be no difficulty in meeting it, but there is little doubt that ©he would only attempt to get ue out by diplomatic methods, accompanied by pinpricks* i?he diplomatic method© musu take a considerable time and the pinpricks can probably all be effectively handle© by the t&gt;*k*0* 9 particularly if we have decided to move and are no longer anxious to keep on good term© with the local authorities in order to avoid prejudicing negotiations in progress. As i ersia has acquiesced in our position at Henjam for a considerable number of year© and ha© been negotiating a lease with u© for about 2 years, we would have good grounds for objecting to a demand for u© to go at very short notice* We can well say they had accepted the principle of a lease and it was only a question of it© terms* We would- 3 - mb notice to more* Moreover, a temporary arrangement for the joint use of Henjam should be practicable if Persia were anxious to get early use of the base for her own ships, as our representative at rehran anticipates. 7. In view of the great advantages of Henjam from strategic and climatic points of view, the Admiralty are very reluctant to acquiesce in any withdrawal. Moreover, they consider that, if we withdraw, there may be a danger of Persia leasing it at a later date to some other European Power, possibly Italy, who will shortly obtain a special position vis-a-vis Persia through her officers being in command of the new Persian war vessels. Our representative at Tehran J apparently still considers it just possible that the present Persian Government may yet be reasonable and grant us a suitable lease. Even if we cannot get a suitable lease from this Government, the Admiralty think that we may be able to carry on more or less as at present until a change of Government takes place. 8. rhe advantages of Henjam and the coat of a suitable alternative base, which is dealt with in paras.2b - 28, would in the opinion of the Admiralty justify some much more substantial financial inducements being offered to Persia than have so far been contemplated. The maximum so far suggested is a rent of £2,000 per annum. There are grounds for considering that the offer of a substantial lump sum in return for a suitable long term lease, with provision for renewal, would be justified. 9. In this connection the Admiralty would draw attention to the possibility of Imperial Airways using H enjam as a night stopping place for their service to India in lieu of some place on the Trueial Coast, which in the opinion of the Admiralty involves serious risk of extensive commitments, a© has already• 4 - been pointed out in paper Ko.M., .(M) 8, and in any caae will neceesitate considerable expenditure that would be avoided by the uee of H enjaa* 10, Henjam would also appear to offer the moat advantageous baee for K,A,P, flying boats operating in the Southern end of the Gulf, 11# Th&amp; Admiralty see no atrong objections to etayirig at Henjam as long as possible in the hope of ultimately obtaining &amp; suitable lease, fhere would be no necessity to let Persia blacltmail us ae really objectionable conditions need not be accepted. An alternative base can be made whenever we are prepared to incur* the expendi ture of the substantial sum involved and it is to be hoped that later w© shall be better able to afford this, 12, whe Admiralty do not concur in the suggestion that the preparation of an alternative base should be proceeded with in order to facilitate the negotiations of a lease of Henjam, „uch a course is considered objectionable from a financial point of view and there would also appear to be political objections to making the necessary arrangements with the Shdikh of Bahrein and starting the work if it were not quite definite that they were to be proceeded with, 13, The Admiralty do not agree that it is practically certain that Persia will want us to clear out of Henjaa because she will want it for her own N vy. It is thought quite likely that the ereian Navy will make its headquarters at some much more civilised spot and possibly put to sea less and less frequently. It has already been reported that itwill tofc baeed on Bushire and have* barracks on shore there* kwen if the/ want to use Hen jam occasionally) they might like us to maintain a depot there they can use and we might then arrange some agreement on the lines of the ttei-hai-wei agreement with China. 14* In order to appreciate the importance of a satisfactory base in the Gulf, it is necessary U&gt; o*nftider why we maintain a squadron there* 16. British interests in the Persian Gulf date from the year 161© and political control has been exercised consistently from about the year 1763 when the Bushire Residency was established. throughout this period the need for the maintenance of naval forcee in the ; eralan Gulf in peace to support the olitleal Resident has been demonstrated* 16. Hitherto no foreign Power has maintained a naval force in the waters of the Persian Gulf. Comparatively minor British naval forces have, therefore, in normal times been sufficient to afford the necessary support to the Political Resident. fhic state of affairs is, however, now drawing to a close. The i ersian Government tea purchased, and will in the near future establish in the Persian Gulf, a small squadron of naval vessels; it seems probable, and this opinion is ©hared by the British Rinisttr at Tehran, (vide Tehran letter FSo.386 of S3rd «Tuly, 1931), that the arrival of this force in the Gulf will give rise to aerioua additional difficulties. Proa the political point of view, therefore, the need for maintaining a British force in Persian Gulf waters is likely to be considerably increased in the near future. An additional factor increasing the importance of maintaining our naval position in the Gulf is the development of the air route to India*6 17# The duties falling in tint© of peace upon the Havy in the Gulf may be summarised as follows (1) To maintain our position in the Gulf generally and prevent any foreign country from having any convincing reason for attempting to obtain a footing in the Gulf. (g) To uphold our special position vis-a-via the iiheikhs of Koweit, Muscat, Bahrein and of the Truei&amp;l coast# (3) To collect news and intelligence# (4) To co-operate with the Koyal Air Force# (6) To suppress piracy. (6) To suppress the slave traffic. (7) To suppress illicit arms traffic# (8) To check tribal hostilities at sea# (9) To convey and export our Political Officers as is so frequently necessary on the Arab coast# (10) To safeguard British trad© in the Gulf. (11) To safeguard British oil interests# (IS) To preserve order on the pearl banks during the pearling season in the summer# (13) To visit the Bhatt-al-Arab to maintain order amongst the large number of dhows there during the date loading season# 18# In war, in addition to the above, control of the rersian oil export and assistance in maintaining the strategic air route to India would be important responsibilities falling upon the navy# 19# *jcp©riance has shewn that the performance of these duties necessitates the maintenance continuously in Persian Gulf waters of a minimum force of 3 vessels; indeed, the Indian Government’s contribution of £100,000 per annum is made on the distinct understanding that there will always be 3 ships operating in the vicinity of the Gulf# 20m Maintenance in any particular area of a given * force of warships is dependent upon the total number of vessels#••vefcfcfcie available aric upon the relative situation ot' -ho base from which those ships operate* Ihe nearer the base to the area of operations, the less will be the time wasted by vessels in visiting the base for the purpose of replenishing fuel and stores and for the recuperation of the ships 9 companies, and the less therefore will be the total number of vessels needed* In the past, an adequate operational base for the vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron has been available at HenJam and It has therefore only been necessary for the vessels of this squadron to cult their area of operations for the purpose of docking and repairs, which could only be carried out at Bombay and Colombo* In these circumstances a force of 4 ships has proved adequate for the maintenance within the area of operations of the minimum of 3 vessels. 21* It is clear that the evacuation of Henjam would necessitate either the provision of an alternative base elsewhere in the Gulf or the utilisation of an existing base outside the area of operations of the Persian Gulf squadron. The nearest bases outside the Gulf which are suitable or could be made suitable ar Bombay and Karachi* Bombay is approximately 1100 miles and Karachi about 600 miles from the [trait of Ormuz* Using Karachi, the nearer of these two, would entail the ships of the Persian Gulf squadron operating from a base some 2 days steaming from their area of operations. 22* Past experience ha© shewn that, in view of the extremely trying climate of the Gulf and the lack of recreational facilities for the crews of the ships employed therein, it has been desirable that ships should spend approximately 7 J days per annum at Henjam where the necessary recreational facilities for the men have btn n provided. In view of the additional stecusing entailed by operating from a base so far removed from their area of operations, it is probable****9 and the coat at least ^5,000 to £4C f Q00.

If it can be included at all. It is certain that no more than a small sum could be provided, with the result that the work could not be started till late in the sumacr of 1932* It is more probable that it would have to be deferred al togt ther and considered next year for commencement in 1933* 87.

CONFIDENTIAL. - -x Section 1. - [ ' [E 4979/841/34] No. 1. Mr. Dodd to the Marquess of Reading.—(Received October 2.) (No. 523. Secret.) My Lord, Tehran, September 22, 1931. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's Secret despatch No. 512 of the 7th September, in which you ask me for my views upon the position at Hen jam. 2. I do not consider that for the present the Persian Government are likely to put forward an open demand for evacuation, although they may, in anticipation of the resumption of treaty negotiations, embark upon a policy of pinpricks designed to remind His Majesty’s Government of the precarious nature of their position. The desire of His Majesty’s Government to remain at Henjam offers them a most useful weapon in treaty negotiations, and until these negotiations are resumed they would gain no advantage by throwing this weapon away unnecessarily. They might, of course, be unable to refrain from action in the event of some local incident occurring -in which their amour-propre was involved, and which received sufficient publicity. But, for the moment at any rate, they do not appear to be seeking pretexts for making trouble. They have, for instance, contented themselves, so far as can be seen, with a paper protest regarding the four slaves who took refuge on board His Majesty’s ship £ ‘ Folkestone (see my despatch No. 500 of the 21st September). The fact that the ship’s officers were in the right would not have deterred them from making use of this incident had it suited them to do so. 3. It is unlikely, moreover, that either the original status quo agreement with regard to the Gulf, or the later and more general assurance given by Teymourtache when negotiations were broken off, would deter the Persian Government from raising the question of Henjam if they thought it opportune. Teymourtache’s assurance in particular is of a somewhat flimsy kind. The Persian Government might plausibly claim that the first was come to in con templation of the early conclusion of negotiations and the second in contemplation of an early resumption of negotiations, and that as, in fact, the negotiations have been neither resumed nor concluded, neither agreement is now valid. The inter pretation which they place upon the agreement in respect of the forcible nationalisation and conscription of Bahreinis suggests that they would have no hesitation in claiming that the application to Henjam of general measures in force before the agreement, but not previously applied there, would be no breach of the agreement. They have already, in fact, raised difficulties about such matters as the importation of supplies for the coal coolies, and, quite recently, for residents in the concession generally; and the employment of Persian subjects as bakers or washermen. This, if it is not due to mere ineptitude (compare the reasons for the closure of the Duzdap Railway), may be intended, as I have indicated above, to emphasise the weakness of His Majesty’s Government s position and their dependence on Persian goodwill, but it is probably not intended deliberately to render the position intolerable. Finally, the Persian Government might claim that the closure of the Duzdap Railway was itself a breach of the status quo entitling them to break it at Henjam. The weakness of the argu ment would not deter them from using it. 4. In these circumstances it is clear that if the Persian Government make no move to secure evacuation, it is because they do not choose to do so. This, however, is not an indication of the strength' of His Majesty’s Government's position, but of the reverse. It is because the Persian Government know that this position is weak that they are content to wait upon events in the hope of exploiting it to the full when negotiations are resumed. 5. The situation will alter considerably if, in the course of the negotiations, the Persian Government decide that the inducements which His [281 b—1].&gt; Majesty's Government have to offer for the grant of a lease at Henjam are not after all sufficiently attractive. This may well happen, lor apart from the transfer of the Dazdap Railway, which is already earmarked, so to sneak, lor the southern air route (a point hitherto at least outside the treaty) of the war and post-war debt, which the Persian Government do not intend to pay in any case, His Majesty’s Government have little that is tangible to offer. Unless,! therefore, some fresh inducement were forthcoming, the Persian Government might quite easily begin by making minor difficulties at Henjam in the hope of exerting pressure, and end by declaring that no lease could be granted. 6. Although it is still not possible to state exactly when negotiations will be resumed, it is not unreasonable to expect that this will be before next spring, when the first units of the Persian navy are expected to reach the Gulf. Once this happens, the situation will be still more radically changed. It is most unlikely that the Persian Government yet realise the full value of Henjam. But the measure of its importance for 'His Majesty’s Government is the measure of the importance which it may soon assume for the Persian Government. When that day comes they will, without question, set to work to secure Henjam for them selves, unless they are already bound by an agreement which effectively precludes this. It is, unfortunately, impossible to guarantee that the negotiations, even if they began to-day, would be finished by next spring, and it is equally impossible to guarantee that, even if they w T ere finished, the agreement regarding Henjam would be unassailable. 7. Assuming for the moment that the Persian Government w~ere disposed in principle to grant a lease at Henjam, I can see little prospect of the terms of that lease being more favourable than those contained! in the latest Persian drat of the Henjam Protocol. It is even possible that the Persian Government may withdraw much that they may have already offered, and that the negotiation of even the most unsatisfactory lease would involve much delay and many conces sions. But even with the present Persian draft there can be no real security. It gives the Persian Government too many opportunities to render the position there intolerable whenever they begin to covet the anchorage for themselves. Nothing short of the British draft enclosed in Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 368 of the 29th July, 1930, including the original form of article 6 regarding jurisdiction in the concession, will provide adequate security. The amended form of this article suggested to Teymourtache on the 28th July, 1930, would, I fear, offer no sufficient guarantee. The prospects of securing the acceptance of the British draft are, however, exceedingly remote, and even if it were accepted there could never be nn\ guarantee, in the case of the Persian Government, that its terms would be faithfully carried out. I do not think that the present Persian Government would ha\e anv difficulty in securing the ratification by the Majlis of any agreement of which they approved, though they might use the Majlis as an excuse for the rejection of any agreement of which they subsequently repented. . Your Lordship will not wish me to repeat the general arguments for a w ithdrawal from Henjam which have, if I mav venture to say so, been fully and adequately expressed by the representatives of the Foreign Office and India Office » * 16 Committee of Imperial Defence Sub-Committee meeting held on the 8th August. I wall only repeat that Henjam is the biggest liability on the British side of the negotiations, while withdrawal would not in any way constitute an asset as the representatives of some departments at the meeting appeared to think. If the British negotiator enters the discussions with the knowledge that tiere is no alternative to Henjam and that a lease must be secured at all costs, ie must be prepared to give way on most of the other points which the Persian negotiator may bring forward, and to concede everything which the Persian nego- tiator may ask with regard to the details of the lease itself. If on the other hp 1 ihk be c ^ n enter J; he discussions with the knowledge that, though Henjam may th desira ^ le s .^ e ’ an alternative can none the less be made available, he exeent k nn fLf in V h f lf Government are unwilling to grant a lease nmded and wib| Stl Ma J est L | Government are unwilling to be black mailed and will withdraw altogether. It is just possible that rather than lose their weapon altogether, the Persian Government might consent to a lease on eve^when He PersI hlCh W0I i lc ] Prelude the possibility of a forced withdrawal, even when the Persian navy felt the need for Henjam for itself. forward 1 wRW ^ tbe P re P arations at Bahrein could be carried a ithout the fact that they were being undertaken coming to the3 knowledge of the Persian Government. But unless it is certain that complete secrecy could be observed, it would he necessary to announce in advance the intention to transfer the depot (see Mr. Lascelles's telegram No. 165 of the 27th July). In the case of the Persian Government openly demanding evacuation, the prestige of His Majesty's Government would, of course, be more ^adequately protected if they could point to the fact that they had already begun to prepare a site elsewhere as proof that they had already decided to leave Henjam of their own accord, than if no such preparations had been begun. But this would not he so satisfactory as forestalling the Persian Government altogether. A definite announcement by His Majesty’s Government of their intention to with draw would not, however, necessarily make it impossible for them, if treaty negotiations were resumed before any large sum had been expended at Bahrein or elsewhere, to place Henjam on the agenda of the negotiations, explaining that though a move to Bahrein had been decided upon they were, nevertheless, prepared to retain Henjam if a reasonable rent and reasonable conditions could be agreed upon. But this could not be done unless the completion of the site at Bahrein within a reasonable period could he counted upon as an absolute certainty. Even, moreover, if a satisfactory lease at Henjam were achieved by these means, it would still, in my opinion, be desirable to keep the Bahrein site in reserve in case it should prove impossible towards the end of the twenty-five years’ lease to negotiate a renewal on satisfactory terms. 10. My conclusions are, therefore, that it would be unwise to count upon any more satisfactory agreement than the present Persian draft of the Henjam Protocol; that in this form the protocol, even if His Majesty’s Government were to accept it, would not prevent the Persian Government from forcing the withdrawal of His Majesty’s Government by indirect means when ■once they learned the value of Henjam to themselves; that they will unquestionably learn this value when the Persian navy arrives in the Gulf or very shortly afterwards; that if the Persian navy arrives before an agree ment has come into force, the Persian Government are likely at the least to wish to share the anchorage and may well break off negotiations and put forward an open demand for withdrawal; that in these circumstances the preparation of an alternative site, at Bahrein or elsewhere, is a matter of urgent necessity; that provided this is put in hand, hut not otherwise, the British negotiator may, with some prospect of success, seek to secure a lease at Henjam satisfactory in itself and secure against future encroachments; and that whether the latter point is decided on or not, an announcement of His Majesty’s Government’s intention to construct a depot elsewhere is desirable, if there is any danger of leakage, before active preparations are begun and, in any circumstances, before negotiations are resumed or the Persian navy reaches the 'Gulf. 11. I am well aware that the obstacle to this policy is the financial one. So far as the cost of transferring the depot to Bahrein is concerned, the expenditure required for a new site has, I believe, been estimated at about £30,000. For this a permanent site could be secured. At Henjam, on the other hand, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to pay in the last resort £1,000 a year for twenty-five years. Apart, therefore, from the fact that the Bahrein proposal involves the payment of a lump sum at a time of great financial stringency, it appears upon the whole to be a profitable investment. But even if the sum involved were considerably larger, I should still consider withdrawal from Henjam as an imperative necessity, if the risk of a severe blow to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf is to be avoided. 12. With regard to the further question of the additional expenditure which might be involved if preparations for a depot were to be begun at Bahrein and a lease of the site at Henjam were subsequently acquired, I wish to make it clear that the suggestion that, even though preparations might have been begun at Bahrein the British negotiator should still attempt to secure a lease at Henjam, is purely subsidiary. The important point is that His Majesty’s Government should be ready, and able, to withdraw from Henjam when necessary. 13. I venture to add that I have written this despatch on the assumption that the present Government, or Governments of a similar complexion, will remain in power. If the entire regime were to change, it is possible that a friendlier Government might be anxious to please His Majesty's Government by making things easy at Henjam, or a weaker one be unable to take effective action to prevent their continued occupation. But I consider that such changes are too4 speculative to be taken into account in this connexion Moreover, any future Government that possessed a navy would be obliged, so far as I can see, o a ac the same importance as the present one may be expected to do to the possession oi Hen jam as an anchorage for its own use.

India Office, in consultation v/ith Admiralty and Foreign Office, are considering question of transfer of Maval base from Henjam. It is argued that with advent of new Persian naval force, we might find ourselves obliged to kk evacuate Henjam at short notice and that it would be difficult to resist Persian pressure to this end. Besides, it is considered doubtful whether we would be able to secure lease of Henjam on satisfactory terms and in any case, we would not, in time of war, be able to use Henjam unless we were prepared to infringe neutrality of Persia. Government of India do not see why if Henjsm protocol can be secured, occasional presence of Persian warships at Henjam anchorage should render use of facilities provided by it Impossible for us. Moreover Henjam is best position in the Gulf and cannot be vacated without loss of prestige. They recognise that if protocol is not secured Persians can make position untenable whether their navy materialises or not. Bahrein considered most suitable alternative. Please telegraph your views in the matter urgently especially on suitability of Bahrein as a naval base in the Persian Gulf. If it is not suitable now do you think it could be made so at reasonable cost. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S | Letter No /4 m.

As pointed out by Mr. Laithweite the G. of I f s telegram of 14th August (P.Z.5E16/31) is based to some extent on misapprehension. There is no question at present of re-opening the general negotiations with Persia; moreover the bargaining asset which we have in the Du^a^ Railway is being used | f 0 r an attempt to obtain continuance of our Air Route ' concession^ from the Persian Government, so tnat it j cannot be used for obtaining the Henjam protocol as the G. of I. have suggested.

On the other hand the preparation of an alternative station at Bahrein or elsewhere would obviously be an expensive matter, and,in deference to the views of the Treasury and of the Admiralty, it was decided that we should remain at Hanjam as long as l possible. No action by the 1.0. is required on this I decision except to inform the G. of I. You/You will remember that C.

(0) 9) regarding the question of the transfer of the Faval Base at the Persian dulf from Hen jam to Bahrein. THE CHAIkI.IAIT stated that the object of the meeting was to discuss the foXlowing conclusion reached oy mi inter-departmental conference held at the India Oflice on Konday, the 20th July, which was that, while Henjam - if we could secure a lease free from onerous conditions and restrictions - presented great advantage and was probably on the v/hole the most suitaole naval oase in the C-ulf, there seemed little s if any, prospect in present circumstances of a satisfactory arrangement being come to regarding it with Persia. In these circumstances, the balance of advantage appeared definitely to rest with removal to Bahrein as soon as possible^if it proves practicable to establish a base there'. KPe IxMTHHAITE said tint the question was essentially one for the Foreign Office as regards its political aspect 5 sind the Admiralty as regards its strategic aspect. Ine India Office, as at present advised, were in general agreement with the coneIasions of the interdepartmental meeting held on 20th July. The Government of India had been ashed to express their views on those conclusions and on the question generally, if possible in time for to-day’s meeting, but owing to their desire to consult tne Baval Gommander-in- Chief and the Director of the R.I.M., an interim expression of their views only had been possible. (Mr. Laithwaite then read the Government of India’s telegram of 14th August, of, which a copy is circulated as an appendix to the minutes of the meeting). The suggestion in the Government of India’s telegram of 14th August that no move as regards Henjam should be made until His Majesty’s Representative was satisfiedmm ■■■MB* ■■■■■■■ ona.b negotiations were definitely broken off witli Persia 5 was 3 he thought } to some extent the result of a misapprehension- It had nou 5 so far as he was awarej been our intention to suggest using removal from Kenjam as a b:rgaining counter - there was the obvious danger that if v/e did so we might be met with an intimation from the Persian Government of their desire to resume our concession there immediately. as regards tue remaincier oi the telegramc, it would be remembered that we had experienced great difficulty with the Persians over the worming of the Henjam Protocols and that on the date ox the collapse oi the negotiations the important question of jurisdiction remained entirely unsettled. As regards the possible effect on our prestige in the Gulf generally Ox 1 waving xie.ijam 5 the India Office s as stated at the meeting cf 20th July^ 7 /ere disposed to think that we should lose less face by going of our own free will and because it suited us 3 than by going as the result of pressure from Persia. In reply uo a question from Mr. Parkinson 3 he stated that our 01 i fe lua_L concession 5 obtained in 18683 was merely for the establishment of a cable station, within a strictly limited area and subject to the proviso that the number of employees And the extent of the buildings should not at any time be allowed to exceed a number specified in the grant. Airce then tne limits of the original concession had been very substantially exceeded and a naval station established. -,/e had clearly no legal locus standi save in respect of the original concession, and even that concession was of course held only during pleasure. ima. KEIILKL explained that the Foreign Office were concerned in this question in two ways. In the first place, it would fall on them to deal with any difficulty which might arise with the Persian government over our position in henjam. as Mr. Laithwaite had pointed out ,that position, in so far as 9 ’*o —the naval stall on was concerned, hod no lo^al basis. It was true that the Persians had more or loss agreed to 1 .13. a. l''l o Q. 1II L» il ‘ ... U quo in the Gulf pending a general settlement. There was *, however 5 no uarantee that they ',.ou Id respect this under talcing indef initely ^ and there in the oninion of the foreign rn-p-* ^ ierious nsh of the Per O Cixlo endeavo crin:. to irAce our position in hen. 1 am impossible with a view to driving us out. ohouid this occur he 7 /ished to maice it clear that the foreign Office would be unable to put up any adequate defence. -he Persians were 5 in f act s in a position to drive us out of aon1am at any moment P and the Poreign Office would be powerless to resist such pressure. In the circumstances ? tjiey would much prefer« iron the poiitichl point of view, that Hen 3 am should be vcluntaihly evacuated as soon as possible, since this would be far less damaging to our prestige, both in the Gulf and vis-^-vis the Persian Government, than an ignominious withdrawal under Persian pressure. The foreign Office were also concerned with the question from the general point of view. Our present vulnerable position in Henjam constituted an important lever against us in the hands of the Persians. Go long as we were dependent on Persian goodwill in lien jam, our general position vis-a-vis Persia was correspondingly weakened. ,/e should be in c. far stronger position to negotiate a. satisfactory general settlement with Persia, if we v T ere free of this most unsatisfactory commitment. In reply to paestions Hr. Pendel said that the Henjam question was certainly at present one of the main difficulties in the way of a general settlement, but that he did not think that it would be possible to represent a voluntary withdrawal from Hen jam as e. concession to Persia- 4 - or to utilise it as a bargaining counter, since tiie Persians justifiably claimed that our xoosition in the island had no legal sanction. GAPTAIiT IvlCOPdi said that lien jam had considerable strategic value, situated &amp;s it v/as at the entrance to the Persian Gulf at its narrowest point. To give up Henjam, and to move to Bahrein, would ente.il losing a definite strategic advantage. The Persian Government had not yet demanded our evacuation end judging by Sir P. Clive’s despatch of June 28th, 1931, there was no assurance that they would do so in the near future. The Admiralty v; ould prefer to wait on events and retain the existing naval base at Kenjam. Should we prematurely evacuate this island, our claim would automatically be relinquished, with little hope of ever regaining such a well placed anchorage. He considered that a move to Bahrein would involve considerable capital cost, as not only a lightship and buoying,*but considerable dredging would probably be necessary to make the anchorage suitable. Local information and charts had recently been received by the Admiralty and of plans and estimate^/costs were under prepara cion. The present financial stringency therefore afforded a further argument for remaining at Henjam. COLONEL BISCOE said that, while not a legal jxpert, it seemed to him that in time of war we should be unable to use Kcnjam unless we were prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia. Vhereas if we wnre prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia, a naval base could quickly be re-established by sending some oil barges there should its reoccupition be expedient. C.wPTAIK MOORE quoted several instances of places leased to the British, end to Poreign countries, which it■■■■■ ■■ n might he expected would he used hy the lessee in time of war. that during the late war troops were landed on the Persian littoral v/ith impunity and that if desired naval forces could always re-occupy fenjam. md in the event of Peza ohah’s death an orderly succession was unlihely and the situation in Persia night become chaotic. one in authority to question our occupation. He agreed alternatives. MR. RHLIDSL said that the Foreign Office wished to Henjam at a moment’s notice. They felt strongly therefore ? that we should he ready with an alternative^ and considered that v/hatever night he decided about an i mediate voluntary evacuation of Henjam ? it was essential that the possihility of finding an alternative should he most seriously considered without delay. that the war Office and Air Ministry generally agreed with He sugg he far stronger if we were in possession/instead of having to re-occupy fenjam. The latter act might well he regarded as infringing neutrality COLONEL BI3C0S suggested Bahrein as an alternative between Bahrein end Kenjam was very small. lie pointed out intentions of the Persian Government. IIe$ however ? CAPTAIN MOORE instanced this as an additional reason for staying on in Henjam 5 as in that case there might he no warn the Admiralty that it might he necessary to evacuate-6 the Admiralty point of view. COLOhlL BI3C0E said that he had recently discussed this question v/ith the Naval Officer Commanding in Cnief 5 who considered that lien Jam was strategically the 'best anchorage s Bahrein 'being the least unsuitable alternative# attention having 'been drav.n to Gi statement in a recent desnatch from Sir Robert Clive to the eifect ti.*.at it was his considered opinion that the Persians would not eject us from Hen jam c&gt; MR. REirDEL said that he would not lihe to commit the Foreign Office to a complete endorsement of this view. In any case ? even if the Persians should not formally insist on our evacuation of the island^ they could easily render our position there untenable oy minor obstructive mecisures. In a recent private letter from the Minister of Court to Sir E. Clive s subsequent to Sir R. Clive’s despatch to which reference had been made, Teymourtache had rather ominously alluded to Persia’s claim to refuse to allow any foreign naval base on Persian territory* Moreover, a small Persian navy was now being formed unaer Italian officers* It would be necessary for this navy to use a Persian harbour. Bushire had been suggested but was reported to be quite unsuitable. Mohainmerah could only be approached through Iraqi waters* Kiior Musa was not yet developed end was, in any case, very out of tne way. The Italian officers would probably soon realise that lien Jan was the most suitable anchorage for the new Persian ships end this night well precipitate a crisis. CAPTAIN MOORE suggested that we should remain at lien Jam until the Foreign Office stated that there was no hope of our retaining our existing concession. It was possible that the present unsatisfactory relations might improve and any premature withdrawal would render our return there difficult.r* ^ © HR. RBITDSL said that it would he difficult x or the Foreign Office to lay dov/n the exact moment when it would he necessary to evacuate the island in order to forestall acute Persian pressure ? since tnis would he a qa^^uxon o_ opinion rather than/fact. The Foreign Ofuce would; however ? he prepared to give such advice as was in their power on the point 9 end this might he-less difficult in some months’ time when possibly the situation regarding the general negotiations might he somewhat clearer. Meanwhile, although the Foreign Office felt strongly that preparations for a move should he pressea on 5 he wished to emphasise the importance cl giving no indication that such a move was in contemplation, since, if the Persians thought that we were about to evacuate voluntarily and that they might therefore lose tne lever which our presence in hen jam at present afforded !ni.^m, they might decide to try to anticipate our action ay forcing us out and thus doing their best to dimxnisn -ur standing in the Gulf. Any preparations for a move should, therefore, he conducted with great secrecy* MP. TRICKETT send that the voluntary evacuation of henjam should not he approved without regard to its financial consequences. In any case he thought they should have the considered views of the admiralty as to tnoir requirements and the cost of providing them at Bahrein. Until then the Treasury could hardly commit themselves, he inquired whether the word 'practicable • in the resolution approved at the Conference of the 20th July was intended to include financial practicability. TKf CrLA-IRl-IAIT said that it was so intended.-8 HP* 1,3. TRICISTT said that that relieved bin of some anxiety.

CONFIDENTIAL. BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GQYER-NME7NT (T; 50 65 J “ ly Section 3. TE 3616/18/34] No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received July 11.) (No. 343. Confidential.) ^ gj r Gulhek, June 28, 1931. IN my despatch No. 332 of the 26th June, I endeavoured to give a general outline of the course of events in this country during the past five years 2. I now propose to submit a few observations on the subject of the two treaties, negotiations for which have been in abeyance since last autumn. 3. These negotiations were started nearly three years ago. With equal goodwill on both sides I have no hesitation in saying that both treaties could easil\ have been concluded in a maximum of six months. How, then, is one to account for the present state of affairs ? Are w 7 e to believe that the settlement of these two treaties presented such insuperable difficulties, that His Majesty s Govern ment adopted such an intransigent attitude, or that Persia was faced with the alternative of sacrificing national rights which would jeopardise her status as an independent sovereign Power? On the contrary, His Majesty s Go\eminent have been disposed to show the utmost conciliation throughout, and to go far more than half-way to meet Persian susceptibilities in regard to her sovereign rights in the desire to regularise, in the common interest, certain anomalies still existing, more especially in the Persian Gulf. No, the reason must be sought elsewhere, and is really to be found in that inherent Persian dislike and suspicion of finality, more especially w'hen it takes the form of a written agreement. Recent experience has shown, however, that even when a written agreement exists, as in the case of our Tariff Autonomy Treaty with Persia or the Perso-German Commercial Treaty, Persian ingenuity finds little difficulty in nullifying the effect of such agreements. The Minister of Court did this by passing the Trade Monopoly Law. So long as this law remains in force it would be pure waste of time to negotiate a commercial treaty. On this point all^ my colleagues are of the same opinion. One is thus faced with the question : £ ‘ Is it worth while to make any treaty with Persia at all? ” In present circumstances I am inclined to say that it is not. The Persians are notorious for signing agreements and then declining to ratify them, or even to submit them to their Parliament for ratification. They have done this in the case of almost ever\ international agreement since the war. So far as His Majesty s Government are concemed, four agreements occur to me which since the war have been signed, but not one of which has been ratified. These are the Supplementary Commercial Agreement of the 21st March, 1920, the Imperial Airways Agreement of 1925. the Persian Debt Agreement of 1926. and the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928. What chance exists, then, that if a general treaty were signed it would ever be ratified by the Persian Government ? , t tt- • 4. The next question I would ask myself is: “Would His Majesty s Government be seriously inconvenienced if no general treaty were concluded in the near future ? It is generally accepted, I think, that apart from the desirability of getting the Persian Government to drop once for all their preposterous claim to the islands of Bahrein, the only real advantage, other than a settlement of the war and post-war debt, that we stand to gain from the proposed treaty is the regularisation of our admittedly anomalous position in the Island of Henjam. The protected anchorage of the island for His Majesty’s ships and tile landing rights for the officers and men on the island itself are an unquestionable benefit, and it would be a great inconvenience to the Admiralty if these rights, of which His Majesty’s ships have been in enjoyment for the past twenty-five years, were no longer available. 5. The final question I would ask is: “ Is there any likelihood of the Persian Government attempting to make us evacuate the island and refusing to allow our ships to anchor in their territorial waters off the island ” ? The Persian dislike of finality implies equally an aversion to extreme measures of any kind. It is [200 1—3]not impossible that the Persian Government may again question our right pending a treaty settlement—of remaining in Hen jam on the basis of the status quo. They will almost certainly continue to indulge in petty obstruction, pin pricks, and a more or less offensive attitude, but I very much doubt their going beyond this. It would be a definitely unfriendly act officially to demand our withdrawal, and if we declined to accede, to refer the matter to the League of Nations. There is always a point beyond which the Persian Government will never venture to go in their dealings with His Majesty's Government. Persia in a chronic state of indifferent, often definitely bad, relations with two of her powerful neighbours—Soviet Russia and Turkey—will not, in my opinion, take such an extreme step as openly to defy His Majesty’s Government over the question of Hen jam. But should she, contrary to all precedent and to my expectations, actually do so, His Majesty's Government could retaliate by at once officially demanding the repayment of the £2 million debt, and if necessary give publicity to the facts of the case. Again, she could independently of any eventual general treaty, temporise over the question and negotiate an ad hoc settlement. That Persia will need financial assistance before long seems to be almost certain, if her present economic policy is persisted in. The only source from which such assistance would be available is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the great financial interest of His Majesty's Government in that company must inevitably give her a voice in such a matter. Dangerous as it is to prophesy, especially in the case of an oriental country, I am none the less of the opinion—the considered opinion—that the Persian Government will not force an issue over the question of Hen jam. 6. In conclusion, I would point out that we have one definite advantage in not concluding a treaty in that until a new treaty is made the old Peace Treaty of 1857, with its perpetual most-favoured-nation clause, remains in force. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE.not impossible that pending a treaty set quo.

LAITHnAITE said that the previous discussion (on the situation created by the acquisition by Persia oi ships manned by Italian officers) had focussed attention on the difficulty of our position at Henjam. There was, he thought, general agreement that Henjam was the most suitable naval base in the Gulf. It was well situated at the narrowest point of the Strait (though it was indeed commanded from the Persian Island of Kishm); the climate was good; the necessary facilities for recreation,*etc., had been provided by us. On the other hand, our legal position was far from satisfactory, vve had far outrun the bounds of the original small concession which we held from Persia, and that concession itself we held at pleasure. There was the danger, paiticularly with tne advent of the new Persian naval force, that we might find ourselves obliged to evacuate Henjam at ratner short notice, and it would be difficult for us to resist Persian pressure to this end. Further, there was no certainty, even were this not the case and were we able to conclude an agreement (as had - 2 -been contt, ran luted in tne Persian negotiations) with. Pei'sia under which Henjam should be leased to us for a term of years, that the lease would not be so fenced round by onerous restrictions (particularly as regards jurisdiction) as greatly to diminish its value to us. It seemed desirable, in these circumstances,, to consider alternatives, and the obvious alternative appeared to be Bahrein. Colonel Biscoe expressed himself as strongly in favour of removing from Henjam at once, before we found ourselves forced to go by the Persians. It seemed clear that in peace time we had little prospect of securing a lease of Henjam on terms at all satisfactory to ourselves. In time of war we should in any case be unable to use Kenjam unless we were prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia. There were the further considerations that, while the climate of Bahrein was less satisfactory, we sh uld be welcome guests, and the amount we should have to pay in rent for sites, etc., would prob bly compare very favourably with that now demanded by Persia. He added that our pr sent position at Kenjam was most ignominous for the Navy and that, while he agreed with Sir Robert Clive that the Persians had not probably at the moment any designs on Kenjam, there seemed no question that the Italian naval officers would soon realise that it w r as the only possible harbour in the Gulf. In these circumstances he was strongly in favour of transferring from it at once, before we were forced to do so. Pr. Rended expressed his strpng agreement with the Resident’s views. The Foreign Office felt that our position in Henjam was extremely unsatisfactory, and that we should be very well advised without further delay to concentrate on an alternative. - 3 - m■ ■ HMHPRfff - 4 - ^ yepvciion^tlves said that the question of alternatives to Henjam had been under active consideration* In the past the Admiralty had feho strongly that it was desirable to noltf on to Hen jam, the advantage,'} of which were obvious, and they would probably still be of this opinion if we could get a lease of a satisfactory character. Eut in view of political developments — Pcrsia &amp; nd the difficulties which had arisen in connection with the proposed re-lease of the concession, they had been examining the alternatives, and were at present awaiting certain surveys for which the Government of India had been asked, to enable them to reach a decision as to the merits of Bahrein. In reply to an enquiry whether Gape Musandim did not offer a possible alternative, Mr. Laithwai te said that, climatic condi tions apart, it soemed very questionable whether it would be possible for us to establish a naval base on Musandim in Muscat territory without infringing the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Bahrein seemed for practical purposes the only alternative in the Gulf to Henjam. Mr. Hancock pointed out that it had not yet been proved that a base at Bahrein was a practicable proposition. Dredging v/as necessary and this might prove very expensive. M r. Laithwaite said that, while the question of removal was one of more immediate concern to the Admiralty and the Foreign Office than to the India Office, the India Office wore concerned as to the possible effect on our prestige in the Gulf generally of leaving Henjam. On tne whole they were disposed to think, however, that we should lose less face by going of our own free will and because it suited us than going as the result of pressure from Persia. He enquired whether it might not be possible to evacuate Henjam without any formal notice to Persia, leaving a caretaker (as we have done in the past at Basidu), and thuc keeping alive our rights in Henjam, such as they were, for use as at»ar S ai.niug- counter IS and when the general treaty negotiations were resumed? Mr„ Rend el dou’oted if the -bargaining counter would of any real value. His own inclination was in favour of reducing commitments the legal basis of which was uncertain and which we were not in a position to defend if challanged. nOHCLUSIOil . After further discussion it was agreed that, while Henjam - if we could secure a lease free from onerous conditions or restrictions - presented great advantages and was probably on the whole the most suitable naval base in the Gulf, there seemed little, if any, prospect in present circumstances of a satisfactory arrangement being come to regarding it with Persia. In these circumstances the balance of advantage appeared definitely to rest with removal to Bahrein as soon as possible, if it prn.es practicable to establish a base there. It was agreed that a recommendation should be made to this effect and that it should be brought up in the near future for discussion in the middle Bast Rn'hm^nTnmittee of the Cd.fh Ho BASIDU * Mr. Hancock raised the question of the position at 3asidu„ Were we to abandon Basidu if we abandoned n^njam? Basidu had been regarded as a useful bargaining fact ji , ao we had. definite basis for our position there* Mr P Rendel doubted if there was any advantage in held- ing on to Basidu. Its retention would notbenefit us, and its return to Persia would therefore not be a real concession, and could not sucessfully be represented as such. hr. balthTfaite said that Basidu had been retained solely for use as a bargaining counter; probably we should lose nothing by holding on to it for the present. Arrangements would in any case have to be made for the protection of the Indian navy graves.ENCLOSURE II.

Draft telegram asking for observations of Crovemment of India, with a view to discussion in official Middle East Sub- Committee of C.I.D. on 18th August. Register No. fz SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT mPaper. Department. The question of the transfer of the Naval station in the Persian Gulf from Henjam to Bahrein was discussed at an interdepartmental conference held at the India Office on 20th July, at which Colonel Biscoe was present and the Foreign Office and Admiralty were represented. The minutes of the conference and the conclusion reached by it are attached (P.Z. 4705/31). The general conclusion was that while Henjazn, if we could secure a lease free from onerous conditions or restrictions, presented great advantages and was probably on the whole the nost suitable Naval base in the Gulf, there seemed little, if any, prospect in present circumstances of a satisfactory arrangement being come to in regard to it with Persia, and that in these circumstances the balance of advantage seemed definitely to rest with removal to Bahrein as soon as possible, if it proved practicable to establish a base there. The arguments which led up to this conclusion are fully set out in the minutes of the meeting, and it is unnecessary to summarise them here. Z &lt; The question is now for consideration in the Middle East Sub-Committee on the afternoon of 18th August. Colonel Biscoe has promised to attend. The Foreign Office strongly support the conclusion reached by the interdepartmental conference, and will press vigorously for a decision of principle in favour of removal from Henjam. The Naval Staff are by no means convinced. They tell me privately that if the Foreign Office will say in so many words that there is ^ 4793a 5000 10/30 nro spent/prospect of securiiig an extension on satisfactory terms at Henjam, then clearly they will have no alternative but to move from there. But in the absence of a categorical statement to this effect they are anxious to hold on at Henjam as long as possible. Not only is it strategically the most suitable station (despite the fact that it is commanded from Kishm, and that we could not use it in time of war without violating Persian neutrality), but the cost of removal is likely to be very considerable (preliminary examination suggests that it might be £30,000, but Captain Cunningham tells me that in his view it may very well prove to be twice as nuch, even assuning that we could get the necessary land for nothing at Bahrein), while a further complication is that, once the Persians get to know of our intention to move, they can be relied on to do their utmost, in the interest of making us lose face, to turn us out of Henjam in the most contumelious manner possible. The India Office are rather on the fringe of this argument and are principally concerned with the reactions on our prestige of a move from Henjam to Bahrein (the question of other alternatives to Henjam is considered in the following paragraph). To the argument of prestige I think our general answer would be, as stated at the meeting of 20th July, that we should lose less face by going of our own free will and because it suited us than by 0 Ding as the result of pressure from Persia. Everything clearly turns on the probable Persian attitude I submit that in general, sub'^ectT't^ thejcdlirs^ of the discussion, the India Office representative at the meeting of 18th August might be authorised to take the same general/* \ t ao Minute Paper. Department. 4793a 5000 10/30 general line as at the meeting of 20th July. On the question of incidence of the expenditure involved in moving from Henjam elsewhere in the Gulf, he mi^it avoid committing himself - beyond indicating that if it is on the scale suggested by Captain Cunningham this is a strong argument against moving until we are quite clear that we cannot hope to stay on any terms likely to be acceptable. The Government of India would clearly have to be consulted before any commitment, even contingent, on the question of expenditure could be entered into - it would be of an extraordinary nature, and I am not clear that it Could be regarded as covered by the fifty-fifty division of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. ^ alLejariatjy.gg, tp, Kexijm' On this please see copy of minutes on P. 7218/30, flagged below. The real alternatives are Bahrein and a station in Muscat territory, probably on Cape Musandim. The arguments in favour of Bahrein are conveniently summarised in the private letter of 9th November, 1930, from the Politics! Resident on P.Z. YlZb'ftl* The principal objection is strategic. Bahrein does not conmand the mouth of the Gulf in the same way as does Henjam. The objections to the other main alternative - Cape Musandim - are firstly climatic - we once before had a telegraph station there which it proved necessary to abandon, largely for this reason; and secondly, the uncertainty of our position vis- a- vis the French, in view of the terns of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. For the previous history of our attempts to establish/ mestablish ourselves in this area reference is invited to I paragraphs 65-71 of the India Office Memorandum on Muscat flagged below. In so far as the India Office representativ at the meeting nay be called on to express an opinion, I submit that he should incline generally, subject to the views of the Government of India, towards Bahrein. I before the meeting, the views of the Government of India, to whom a copy of the minutes of the interdepartmental conference of 20th July was sent by the air mail of , 27th July. A draft telegram is submitted. before we abandoned hope about Henjam we should consider the possibility of exercising diplomatic pressure on Persia to allow us to remain there by threatening that if they made difficulty, we should be compelled to fall back on Basidu and develop our concession in that place. The nain objection to this is that we have for practical purposes recognised that Basidu, like Henjam, is Persian territory. X We had indeed held it under an undisputed concession granted by the Imam of Muscat in 1820. But the Imam appears almost indisputably to have held Henjam as a tenant of Persia, which resumed control of the area of which it forms part from him in 1868. We might indeed in the past have made out a fairly good case for contesting Persian claims to the area in question. But we did not do so, and the case must be regarded as having gone by default. There would be no prospect of any Foreign Office support for a proposal to reopen the question now. fT It will be desirable to secure, if possible 4 £ On P. 7218/30 Sir Denys Bray suggested thatDraft Paper. m&lt;tw.

This question has become one of considerable urgency in connexion with the general situation between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government. 2. It would be convenient if the meeting could be held between August 17th and August 22nd, when the Foreign Office and India Office representatives on the Committee will both be available. Colonel Biscoe, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, whose views on this question are likely to be of great importance, will also be available between those dates and could, it is understood, come to London for a meeting on August 18th.

Baxter, (Foreign Office) 0 in the Chair; Admiralty; Air Ministry; MR. RENDEL expressed regret that it had not 'been possible to give the departments concerned longer notice of the meeting, or full details of the subject to be discussed. An urgent situation had arisen from the closing of the Duzdap Railway. The Persian Government had ashed us to re-open this railway, and this had given us an unexpected opportunity for asking the Persians to give us something in retumo Mr. Dodd’s telegram No. 150, copies of which had been circulated officially, had suggested that we should ask for the lease of Henjam. The Foreign Office were not altogether satisfied with regard to this suggestion, and had decided, before consulting the other departments concerned, to obtain the further views of our Charge d’Aftaires at Tehran privately. The difficulties about asking for the Henjam lease could perhaps b© summarised as follows^ Firstly, the Hen jam lease was one of the most important advantages which His Majesty 1 s Government stood to secure as a result of the general treaty negotiations with Persia now in suspense, and it was more than doubtful whether the Persians would be prepared to give it to us merely in return for the re-opening of the Duzdap Railway. /Secondly,Secondly, even if the Persians agreed in principle to set off the re-opening of the railway against the Hen3am lease, it was by no means certain that we could obtain a satisfactory lease; on the contrary, there were important difficulties still outstanding in connexion with the Hen jam Protocol (e*g s Article 6 of that Protocol regarding jurisdiction), which would have to be the subject of complicated negotiations^ Thirdly, if we ashed for the Henjam lease, and we failed to come to an agreement with thu Persians, this would infinitely increase the dangers of our position at Hen jam, which was already sufficiently precarious^ In. these circumstances, it had occurred to the Foreign Office that i was just 7 /orth considering whether it might not be better to ash for the extension of the south Persian air route* A similar suggestion had occurred to the India Office, and he had just seen a letter from Lord Amulree to Mr* ^edgwood 3enn containing an Air Ministry suggestion to the same effect* The air- route certainly seemed to have advantages over Henjam* For one thing, the negotiation of an agreement with the Persians would b© a much more straightforward issue, involving nothing so complicated as the Hen jam Protocol* ’ ? e could simply suggest that the railway and the air route should be operated for a corres ponding period* Again, failure to reach an agreement ~ a possibility which must be frankly faced - would leave us no worse off than at present; in fact, failure to come to terms with the Persians regarding the southern air route, though regrettable, would indubitably clarify the position, and strengthen the case for pushing on with the Arabian route* 2 C Mr* Rendel here read the private telegrams which had been exchanged between the foreign Office and the Charge d*Affaires at Tehran* 3* Mr* Rendel proceeded to emphasize the necessity for /absoluteabsolute secrecy in. connexion v/itil t-liis (question.. He added \na &gt; the correspondence with Tehran showed that the Charge d Affaires was of opinion thatj, if it was decided not to await the Acasiral y ^ ^decision on the practicability of removing their coaling depf- from to Behrein e it would be best to attempt vo sec-uxe from the Persian Government an extension of the permit-non gi^en to Imperial Airways to operate the southern air route, Mr 0 Rendel understood that th© Admiralty were not at present prepared to state whether Bahrein was a possible altemati' e for Hen^sm* It would ha undesirable to postpone approaching the Persians regarding their request for the re'^openlng of the Du&amp;dap Hailway 2 as any delay on our part would probably lead to Persian retaliation in the immediate future 9 possibly at Henjama He suggested^ therefore^ that the Charge d ? Affaires at Tehran should be instructed &amp;s soon as possible to approach the Persians on vhe lines that it makes ll-txa difference to us if the railway is to be re-opened or not* that it could only be re—opened at a substantial loss to us 9 but tnat If the Persians were willing to give us something as a ilUtd pro pjXv we should be ready to re—opon the railway ax. once« In the Foreign Office vieWp it would be better^ for the reasons explained above^ to ask for the air route as a quid pro, cjuo rather than for Hen jamc 4 0 Captain CUI^XNG-HM a . said.that it must not be supposed that the Admiralty had decided in favour of moving the Hen jam depot to Bahrein* The Admiralty attached great importance to Henjam. They realised that it might conceivably at seme time in the future be necessary to move from Henjair.,;; and they were* therofo^-e 0 making enquiries whether it would be possible^ in such an events to make Bahrein their depotj. and how much inis would cost* me* necessary information on this subject had not yet been received* He was inclined to consider the present situation as a Heaven-sent opportunity for regularising our position at Henjanb He thought /itIt would be a pity to use up one of our very few bargaining counters witb the Persians on the air route, which the Persians, if only they would behave as a civilised government, ought to be .sady to make available unconditionally to international aviation 0 Because the Persians acted in an abnormal way, and had not ratified the International Air Convention, it was proposed that we should allow ourselves to be blackmailed into operating the Duz&amp;ap Hailway at great expense. ¥e must take care not to spoil our position in the Persian Gulf. The longer we had to put off concluding an agreement with the Persians about Henjam, the more difficult it would be to conclude such an agreement. 5o Mr. LA.ITOTAITE said that the expense of operating the Duzdap Hailway would be borne by the Government of India, and Hen jam was not. in the India Office view, as important to Indian interests as was the air route. He pointed out that our position at Henjam was not strong, and suggested that there was little disadvantage- and in fact might be definite advantage, in moving from Henjam to Bahrein. 6. Captain CUCTIKGHAM explained in further detail the reasons for the special importance v/hich the Admiralty attached to Henjam. ^ Kr. HEHDEL admitted that Henjam was of great value to the Admiralty from every point of view. Unfortunately, we had no legal case for being there, and if the Persians endeavoured to force us to leave, we should have no legal case for staying there. It seemed to him that if we were to leave Henjam voluntarily,it would be better than if we were to wait, and then have to leave as a result of Persian pressure. But the question now to be considered was whether it was wise in any case to raise the question of Henjam at the- present stage in connexion with the Duzdap Hallway. 80 Mr. HFRTRAM explained the extreme urgency of the air route question. No central Persian route was, in his opinion,practicable /forfor the purposes of Imperial Airways, not even if the Persians wes e to offer us an alternative route through Tehran, It was most important to try to obtain the best practicable air route to India and Australia, and the South Persian route was un doubtedly the besto 9 a Captain CtJTOIHGKAM said that the Admiralty agreed with the India Office as to the extreme difficulty of the Arabian rout eo Mro LAITHT--1TB said that the India Office objections to the Arabian route remained unabstedo But if we were uloimatel^ forced to consider using it, it would be desiraole to consider the suggestion put forward in the latest telegram received from the Ooveiiment of India on the subject, that imperial Airways migh^ use the island of Abu Musa instead of the Trucial coasu as a refuelling or landing point. XI, Mr. PvEKPK B said that, whatever the merits of the suggestion regarding Abu Musa, everyone was agreed that the Arab route v/as more expensive and more dangerous than the south Persian route, which was obviously the best rou'e available, though the Foreign Office felt strongly that we should be ready with the Arabian route as an alternative., The position nor/' was* however, that we had suddenly been asked b^ vhe Persians for something, and had unexpectedly got a chance to ask ior- something in return* There^were three courses open to usn Firstly, we could do nothing} secondly, we could try for the Hen jam Protocol* or thirdly, we could try for the air route** As regards the Henjam Protocol, he fully realised the force of the Admiralty views regarding the importance of Hen jam. But even if we assumed that this was the most important of our desiderata, the question remained whether we were wise to raise it in the present connexionc It would not prejudice the position not to raise the question of Henjsm in ;he present /connexion^oonnexiorio He could not help thinking* however* that to raise it in the present connexion would be had policy froia the ' drairalty pcint of view.

Minutes of an Interdepartrrental Conference held at the India Office on Monday, 20th July, 1933). P P £ S S N T . Mr. J.G.Laithwaite (India Office) - in the Chair. Lieut.-Colonel H.V.Biscoe (Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf) Mr. G.W.Rendel (Foreign Office). Mr. C.W.Baxter (Foreign Office). Mr. W.H.Hancock (Admiralty). Captain Newman, R.N.(Admiralty) Mr. A.F.Morley (India Office). Mr. L aithw aite said that the previous discussion (on the situation created hy the acquisition hy Persia of ships manned hy Italian officers) had focussed attention on the difficulty of our position at Hen jam. There was, he thought, general agreement that Hen jam was the most suitable naval base in the Gulf. It was well situated at the narrov/est point of the Strait (though it was indeed commanded from the Persian Island of Kishm); the climate was good; the necessary facilities for recreation, etc., had been provided by us. On the other hand, our legal position was far from satisfactory. We had far outrun the bounds of the original small concession which we held from Persia, and that concession itself we held at pleasure. There was the danger, particularly with the advent of the new Persian naval force, that we might find ourselves obliged to evacuate Hen jam at rather short notice, and it would be difficult for us to resist Persian pressure to this end. Further, there was no certainty, even were this not the case and were we able to conclude an agreement (as had beenhbhhi “been contemplated in the Persian negotiations) with Persia under which Hen jam should he leased to us for a term of years, that the lease would not he so fenced round by Onerous restrictions (particularly as regards jurisdiction) as greatly to diminish its value to us. It seemed desirable, in these circumstances, to consider alternatives, and the obvious alternative appeared to be Bahrein. Colonel Biscoe expressed himself as strongly in favour of removing from Henjam at once, before we found ourselves forced to go by the Persians. It seemed clear that in peace time we had little prospect of securing a lease of Hen jam on terms at all satisfactory to ourselves. In time of war we should in any case be unable to use Henjam unless we were prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia. There were the further considerations that, while the climate of Bahrein was less satisfactory, we should be welcome guests, and the amount we should have to pay in rent for sites, etc., would probably compare very favourably with that now demanded by Persia. He added that our present position at Henjam was most ignominous for the Navy and that, while he agreed with Sir Robert Clive that the Persians had not probably at the moment any designs on Henjam, there seemed no question that the Italian naval officers would soon realise thdfc it was the only possible harbour in the Gulf. In these circumstances he was strongly in favour of transferring from it at once, before we were forced to do s so, Mr. Rendel expressed his strong agreement with the Resident’s views. The Foreign Office felt that our position in Henjam was extremely unsatisfactory, and that we should be very well advised without further delay to eoncentrate on an alternative. TheThe Admiralty representatives said that the question of alternatives to Hen jam had been under active consideration. In the past the Admiralty had felt strongly that it was desirable to hold on to Henjam, the advantages of which were obvious, and they would probably still be of this opinion if we could get a lease of a satisfactory character. But in view of political developments vis-a-vis Persia and the difficulties which had arisen in connection with the proposed re-lease of the concession, they had been examining the alternatives, and were at present awaiting certain surveys for which the Government of India had been ashed, to enable them to reach a decision as to the merits of Bahrein. In reply to an enquiry whether Cape Musandim did not offer a possible alternative^ Mr,Laithwaite said that, climatic conditions apart, it seemed very questionable whetheijit would be possible for us to establish a naval base on Musandim in Muscat territory without infringing the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Bahrein seemed for practical purposes the only alternative in the Gulf to Henjam. Mr,Hancock pointed out that it had not yet been proved that a base at Bahrein was a practicable proposition. Dredging was necessary and this might prove very expensive. Mr.Laithwaite said that, while the question of removal was one of more immediate concern to the Admiralty and the Foreign Office than to the India Office, the India Office were concerned as to the possible effect on our prestige in the Gulf generally of leaving Henjam. On the whole they were disposed to think, however, that we should lose less face by going of our own free will and because it suited us than going as the result of pressure from Persia. He enquired whether it might not be possible to evacuate Henjam without any formal notice to Persia, leaving a caretaker (as we have done in the past at Basidu), and thus keeping alive our rights in Henjam, such as they were, for use as a bargainingbargaining counter if and when the general treaty negotiations were resumed? Mr.Rendel doubted if the bargaining counter would be of any real value. His own inclination was in favour of reducing commitments the legal basis of which was uncertain we and which/were not in a position to defend if challenged. Conclusion:- After further discussion it was agreed that, while Henjam - if we could secure a lease free from onerous conditions or restrictions presented great advantages and was probably on the whole the most suitable naval base in the Gulf, there seemed little, if any, prospect in present circumstances of a satisfactory arrangement being come to regarding it with Persia. In these circumstances the balance of advantage appared definitely to rest with removal to Bahrein as soon as possible, if it proves practicable to establish a base there. It was agreed that a recommendation should be made to this effect and that it should be brought up in the near future for discussion in the Middle East Sub committee of the C.I.D. £. BASIDU . Mr.Hancock raised the question of the position at Basidu. 7/ere we to abandon Basidu if we abandoned Henjam? Basidu had been regarded as a useful bargaining factor, as we had a definite basis for our position there. Mr.Rendel doubted if there was any advantage in holding on to Basidu. Its retention would not benefit us, and its return to Persia would therefore not be a real concession, and could not successfully be represented as such. Mr.Laithwaite said that Basidu had been retained solely for use as a bargaining counter, probably we should lose nothing by holding on to it for the present. Arrangement would in any case have to be made for the protection of the Indian Havy graves.OB’ Minute Paper. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT c Dated 19 . Rec. Date. Initials. SUBJECT.

In connection with the suspension of negotiations and the possibility that they nay at some later date break down altogether, the Foreign Office are anxious that the Admiralty should consider possible alternatives to Henjam as a Naval base. The Chiefs, of Staff Sub-Committee, in the report submitted by them in October 1928 to the Persian Gulf Sub-Conmittee, expressed the opinion that Henjam was in all respects suitable, and that it was most desirable to retain it as our principal Naval 4475 b 1000 5.30' ¥. ■ Naval base; that Bahrein was unsuitable either as a war base or as a peace headquarters; but that if, on political grounds, it was considered expedient to relinquish our hold on Henjam, the possibility of establishing a base on the Musandim peninsula should be explored. The only other suggestion which has been put forward, is Sir Lionel Haworth^ proposal to establish a base on Dibba, on the east side of the Oman peninsula, The principal alternative to Henjam is thus at the moment Musandim. The possibility of establishing a Naval base on this peninsula has been considered at various times in the past - see in this connection paragraphs 65-9 of the India Office Memorandum on Muscat at flag D below. It seems clear that climatic objections are serious. Apart from this, very careful consideration would have to be given to the extent to which we were free to establish a Naval base in Muscat territory, having regard to the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1861. Dibba has been examined by bath the Navy and the Air Force, but neither of them are disposed to x regard it with great favour. The climate, for one thing, is difficult; while, in the second place, it is outside the Gulf* _ _ _4793a 5000 10/30 Minute Paper. Department. would not diplomatic pressure be worth trying? We might consider putting it to Persia that if we give i up the Henjam facilities we should perforce have to dig ourselves in&gt;at Basidu - thereby postponing its rendition to the Greek Calends.

P. 4842/28. Position and Rights of His Majesty’s Government in Basidu. Introductory. 1. Basiclu is situated on the westernmost point of the island of Kishm, which is separated from the south Persian coast, to which it runs parallel, by Clarence Strait. It lies about 25 miles E. by N. of Lingah town on that coast. It has a reasonably good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, about a quarter of a mile from the shore. The place is one of the healthiest L&lt;&gt;r.ii, 207 . near the entrance to the Gulf; while the island of Kishm, on which it is situated, was described in 1902 by Rear-Admiral Bosanquet as “in my' opinion the most important strategical position in the Persian Gulf from a naval point of view ...” For landing purposes there was stated in 1906 to be a jetty extending to low-water mark. There is a cemetery containing Indian Navy graves, which is maintained in good order and the upkeep of which is a point which will call for consideration should the concession revert to Persia. Extent of the British Concession. 2. The extent of the British concession in Basidu was the subject of investigation in 1901. Difficvdtv was experienced in defining its limits, but g. of 1 . Precis of the Government of India, after examination of the reports of the Politicaf Basidu and Henjam. Resident and the available records, expressed the view that “whatever may c. 370 27. P p. 77-8. have been the original limits of the tract granted to the British Government fj0r ' 15 3 ' -&gt; ' in 1820, as to which there appears to be no information readily available, they are debarred from asserting a claim over Old Bassidore [a village in close proximity to the old Portuguese fort which once existed upon the north-west extremity of the island of Kishm, and which, with the village of Bandar Singau, situated also in close proximity to the Portuguese fort, was formerly regarded as within the limits of the British station] by the prescription of many years. The site of the abandoned settlement at Singow may, however, be regarded as included within the limits of the British Station.” Status of Basidu. 3. The British concession in Kishm was obtained in 1820 by a written grant from the Imam of Muscat, in whom effective control of the island was then vested. The international and legal position of that concession turns on whether this grant was made by the Imam as sovereign of Kishm, and so of Basidu, or as tenant of Kishm from Persia. 4. From the records in the possession of the Government of India it would appear that from the middle of the I8th century until about 1800 Kishm was farmed by Arab tribes from the Persian sovereign, to whom they paid tribute ; that at the beginning of the last century the islands and Bunder Abbas came under the control of the Imam of Muscat, who, however, continued to pay rent to Persia in respect of them ; that the officers of the Imam were, however, reported in 1821 to have stated that neither Kishm, Ormuz nor Larak were specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid ; and that the Muscat Government claimed at the same period that the islands in question belonged exclusively to them. 5. In 1799-1801 endeavours were made by His Majesty’s Government to secure a lease of the island of Kishm from Persia, whose sovereignty was not apparently at the time regarded as doubtful. The active British association with the island, which, as stated above, dates from 1820, originated in the transfer to it in that year of the British military detachment previously stationed at Ras-al-Khaima. The British settlement on Kishm took place with the consent of the Imam of Muscat, who, in his letter on the subject to the Government of Bombay, remarked of Kishm that “ The island in question and all other territories appertaining to me and subject to my authority appertain also to the Honourable Company, and I do not Precis, p. 35, p. 37(18), p. 43 iv (2).

Precis, pp. 14, 16. p. 18. reckon those dominions as appertaining to me but as appertaining to the Honourable Company.” The Imam simultaneously instructed the Sheikh of Kishm to give every assistance in the embarkation and conveyance of the troops. Various places were occupied in the island for the purpose in question, before a decision was finally taken in favour of Basidu in 1822. 6. An immediate protest in strong terms was received from the Persian Government against the British occupation of Kishm, and a reference to the lease granted by the Imam was met by a statement that Muscat was itself a dependency of Persia, and a fortiori Kishm and Henjam, which depended from Bunder Abbas.* Sooner than risk a rupture of friendly relations with Persia, it was decided to remove the British detachment from the town of Kishm. This was done in February 1822, but the Government of Bombay, in their letter repudiating the unauthorised agreement which had been entered into by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of Pars, which had 'inter alia recognised Persian sovereignt} 7, in Kishm, made it clear to the Persian Government that their action was without prejudice to the decision on the question of the respective rights in the island of the Imam of Muscat, and of Persia, and that the island would be restored by His Majesty’s Government to the Imam, from whom they had leased it. As, however, no equally convenient naval station could be found in the Gulf, Basidu was again occupied in 1823, from which year until 1879 it remained the head quarters of the naval squadron in the Gulf. No protest appears at the time to have been made by Persia against its re-occupation, since the date of which the British flag has flown in the concession. 7. In 1853 the Persian Government expelled the Muscat representative from Bunder Abbas and its dependencies (including apparently Kishm), and the agreement finally reached between Persia and Muscat in 185G involved not only the payment of an increased rent to Persia by the Sultan of Muscat, but the recognition as Persian territory “ of the two islands of Ormuz and Kishm, which had been dependencies of Oman.” 8. During the Anglo-Persian War of 1855 Basidu was constantly used as a British depot, but neither in 1853, 1856, 1864 (when the British occupation was confirmed under Article 6 of the Telegraph Agreement with Sultan Thoweymee of Muscat,f then lessee of the island from Persia), on the renewal of the Persian lease to Muscat in 1868, or on the forcible termination of that lease in the same year by Persia, was any exception taken by Persia to the British occupation. 9. The legal position of Basidu, which had been raised in 1863 by a claim from the Persian authorities, which would appear to have been rejected, for the surrender of a slave who had taken refuge in the concession, was again raised by a similar demand in the spring of 1868, and by a murder committed in the same year in the Naval Station. 10. The question was exhaustively considered by the Government of India, who as a result, on 8th September 1868, informed the Government of Bombay that in their opinion “the station in question cannot properly be considered as British territory. It is perfectly true that we have occupied Basidu either as a naval or coaling station for half a century. But the island has always been treated by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas ; and Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including the island of Kishm, and consequently Basidu, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat by the Shah of Persia under circumstances with which the Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar. ... It follows in such circumstances ... as the British Government holds possession of the town of Basidu by permission of the Sultan of Muscat, while that potentate'derives his lease of Kishm which includes Basidu, from the Shah of Persia . . . that Kishm must still be considered as Persian territory. There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Basidu, and it mav have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage, or that we had obtained^ a prescriptive title; but, in looking closely into the question, it becomes evident that our rights are subordinate to those of Muscat which again are, admittedly, entirely subordinate to those of Persia, and havebeen always so treated up to this very hour.” The Government of India, in adding that arrangements should be made to establish a local jurisdiction for petty criminal cases, remarked, “The official holding the trial at Basidu would, in the eye of the law, be merely using the delegated authority of Persia, and Muscat.” 11. The opinion as to the status of Basidu expressed in 1868 by the Government of India, and quoted in the preceding paragraph, has since held the field, and was maintained by them in 1875 in connection with the proposed Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 0 12. In 1878 the Political Resident in the Gulf urged that the grant of 1820 by the Sultan of Muscat and its renewal by his successor in 1861, taken with “such prescriptive right as an undistributed possession of nearly 60 years may be held to confer, constitute our title to possession ... I think it might fairly be urged that the Persian Government have been fully aware all these years of our assumption of the prerogatives of possession at Basidu and have by silence acquiesced.” 1868—1926. 13. The surrender to Persia of the British concession at Basidu, in return for a corresponding concession at tlenjam, and the transfer of the naval station in the Gulf to the latter island, was considered in 1866-8, but was not pursued. In 1878 the infantry detachment which had been maintained in the concession for the protection of the coal depot was reduced from a company to a havildar guard, which was itself withdrawn in 1883. No detachment has since then been stationed at Basidu. In the same year the subordinate non-European stall were withdrawn, and the station placed in charge of a coal agent under the ultimate control of the Bushire Residency. Some concern was caused in 1899 by rumours of designs on Kishm by Russia, which, however, proved unfounded, and in 1901 the Government of India instructed! the Political Resident that “ no official of the Persian Government can be permitted to reside in any part of the station at Basidu without the •express consent of the British Government.” 14. The question of reasserting British claims at Basidu in connection with the extension of British influence in the Gulf was considered, and a decision in favour of action to this end taken, by an inter-Departmental conference in 1902, but, probably consequent on the decision of His Majesty’s Government in 1903-4 that Henjam offered greater advantages as a site for a telegraph station, no action appears to have resulted. A further recommendation as to the consolidation of the British position at the •entrance to the Persian Gulf, including Kishm, was made at an inter- Departmental conference in connection with the Baghdad Railway in 1907, but again apparently without result. 15. In 1905 a request by the Moin-ut-Tujjar for permission to store red ochre in the British concession was refused, and in the same year the coal agent was instructed by the Resident to warn a Persian Customs officer who had interfered in the territory of the concession that “ he has no business in British territory, and if he persists he should not be allowed to come within British territory.” 16. No fresh consignment of coal was landed after 1911 ; the coaling- station was unobtrusively transferred to Henjam in 1913; a proposal to abandon the concession, on grounds of economy, was dropped, apparently for political reasons, in 1923.'' : '° Since 1913 the concession has been maintained on political grounds only, its cost from the 1st April 1927 having fallen on Indian political funds.§ A nominal coal depot and the coal agent are, however, maintained to this day, the British flag is constantly flown,j! and the circuit house is kept up.^f 1926-8.—Reassertion of Persian Claims. 17.

The Admiralty expressed the view that the coaling stations were still m required, 0 while, from a different standpoint, the Foreign Office, in connection v with a complaint received about this time from 1 ersia of the refusal of the British Agent at Basidu to pay customs dues, remarked that in view of the effect on the status of Henjam of admitting the Persian claim to Basidu, “it would be dangerous to allow doubt to be cast on the validity of the British rights to Basidu, which rest on undisturbed occupation over a long period.”! The report of the Government of India reaffirmed the view expressed by their predecessors in 1808 (para. 11 above) as to the status of Basidu, and* added that the station was maintained solely for political reasons and as a bargaining counter in negotiations for the recognition of the British position in Henjam or for some other consideration.^ They regarded it as essential that neither Basidu, after relinquishment, nor any other fuelling station in the Gulf should be leased by Persia to any other Power. 19. An amicable settlement of the Persian complaint referred to in para. 18 was reached§ and it proved possible to avoid any formal discussion of the general question with Persia. 20. The Air Ministry, having in July 1921 raised the question of establishing a seaplane base at Basidu, were referred by the Foreign Office to the opinion expressed by the Government of India, and informed that Basidu was retained “mainly as a possible asset in negotiations with the- Persian Governmentthat the British position in it was extremely weak, and that there would be the strongest political objection to their proposal.^ 21. The possibility of an arrangement with Persia in respect of Henjam on the basis of surrender of Basidu was touched on in unofficial discussion between Sir L. Haworth and the Belgian Director-General of Customs in September 1927, and was well received; but the matter was not pursued. Incident of August—September 1928. 22. There were no further developments till August 1928, when the Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf reported that the Persian Customs official in Persian Basidu, who had previously told the British caretaker that Persian troops would occupy British Bastdu in a few weeks, claimed the right, under instructions from Bundar Abbas, to collect taxes in British Basidu, in which, he said, the British flag had no more significance than a consular flag. 23. The Political Resident requested the Senior Naval Officer to keep a ship off Basidu, and, should Persia attempt to occupy the concession, state that this could not be permitted without the orders of His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India, who were seriously disturbed by the Persian threat, which was closely followed by an attempt by the Persian Customs Mudir, which was prevented by the Captain of H.M.S. Lupin, to arrest a man within the concession, urged that His Majesty’s Government should either— (а) warn Persia that any molestation of British Basidu would be regarded as an unfriendly act; or (б) send a small landing party to remain in Basidu until the situation cleared. 24. The Foreign Office saw objection to the first alternative, which they thought likely to provoke a definite challenge by Persia, as did the Charge d’Affaires, Teheran. As regards the second, they were not prepared to take any action which might lead to an incident at Basidu, and so could not aoree to the landing of a party save with orders to withdraw under protest if challenged. To action on these lines the Admiralty, with whom the India Office agreed, saw strong objection. The India Office suggested in the circumstances reversion to action on the lines taken by Sir L. Haworth as described in para. 23 above.25. The situation was changed by information that the Persian Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas, who (he alleged on orders from Tehran) refused to recognise the British flag in Basidu. was intending to proceed thither with a gunboat on 11th September to make an arrest. The Charge d’Aflaires at Tehran was immediately instructed to make representations to the Central Customs authorities, and, if necessary, to warn the Persian Government that any molestation of British Basidu, “ which has been British station for 1U0 years, would be a complete negation of Minister of Court’s promise to Sir R. Clive.” The Senior Naval Officer was simultaneously instructed that, as the landing of armed Persians in Basidu would be an infringement of the agreement entered into with the Persian Government, it should, as a last resort, be resisted by force, and that, while conflict with the Persians w r as to be avoided if possible, protection was to be afforded to British subjects at Basidu, and the British flag was not to be hauled down. The Senior Naval Officer was instructed, however, that, if the man required by the Persians w-as not a British subject, and the reason for his arrest in British Basidu appeared sufficient, he should himself take steps to arrest him and hand him over to the Persians. 26. It transpired that the individual whom the Persian Government desired to arrest was the British caretaker, Hussein (whose nationality, it may be remarked, is not clear). The naval precautions taken, coupled with the representations made at Tehran, secured, however, the desired result. The Customs official arrived at Basidu on the 19th September, and informed the Commanding Officer of the Cyclamen that he had orders that since the agreement with Persia of 10th May 1928 (i.e. the conclusion of the first stage of the general negotiations, in the course of which, however, no reference was made to Basidu), Basidu had ceased to be British. The Commanding Officer replied that the status of British Basidu was to be considered in the autumn, and that till then no Persian armed forces would be permitted to enter the area. The Customs official appears to have accepted the situation, apd agreed that there should be no attempt at Customs interference, landing of troops or making of arrests. The Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was about the same time informed by the Administrator-General of Customs that the Belgian Director had issued formal instructions to subordinate posts that they were to avoid sending armed vessels with armed landing parties to any of the islands, while the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who expressed entire ignorance of the matter, agreed that “ nothing will be done in regard to islands in Gulf to change status quo pending result of Customs conversations this autumn.” There have been no subsequent developments ; but the naval precautions taken by His Majesty’s ships at Basidu are being maintained. Summary. 27. The legal position in regard to Basidu is concisely set out in para. 10 above. The station cannot be regarded as British territory, and an absolute claim to the concession, in the face of a desire on the part of Persia to resume it, cannot be maintained by His Majesty’s Government. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government have occupied the concession without protest for over a century (1822-1928), and, while they cannot be held by mere occupation to have acquired sovereign rights, undisturbed and unquestioned possession for so long a period would ordinarily be regarded as giving a very strong prescriptive right to continue occupancy on the terms on which the occupation had hitherto proceeded. 28. The station at Basidu has for the last few years been retained to a small extent because of its possible value to the Admiralty for coaling purposes, but primarily for political reasons, and with the object of using it as a pawn in negotiations with Persia, whether of a general character, or immediately directed to the consolidation of the position in Henjam of His Majesty’s Government. The abrupt revival of the Persian claim makes it unlikely, however, that this counter will prove as valuable to His Majesty’s Government for bargaining purposes as was at one time hoped.

The Government of India consider that as the rights in Basidu of His Majesty’s Government derive from the Imam of Muscat in his capacity as tenant under Persia, their derivation can hardly be claimed by itself to substantiate British ownership. But the unchallenged occupation of Basidu. has lasted over a century, and while materially the station is now of little or no use, politically “ it is obviously a valuable counter, for possession unchallenged for a whole century is not easily shaken.Whatever its future, however, “ we shall have to stipulate that our Indian Navy cemetery and British graves there are properly preserved.” To the moving of the coal depot (which, as explained in para. 16, has had a nominal existence only since 1912) they see no prima facie objection.

The Sheikh of Henjam and his Affairs. i 1 t Introductory. Henjam is an island miles long and about 3 miles broad, situated off the south coast of the island of Kishm, from which it is divided by a strait a mile wide and 6-12 fathoms deep in the fairway. It contains a valuable anchorage at Masheh Bay, while at the settlement of Ghail, some 3 miles from the village of Henjam, there is an almost inexhaustible supply of fresh water. The island in addition contains saltmines of some value. Its position off the Persian coast at a point where the Persian Gulf is so narrow that the Arabian coast is ordinarily visible gives it considerable strategic importance. 2. Since 1869 (with an interval between 1881 and 1904) a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Company has been maintained on Henjam with the concurrence of the Persian Government ; since 1911, when the Admiralty coaling depot was transferred to it from Basidu, the island has been employed by His Majesty’s ships stationed in the Gulf as their principal base, and a canteen and playgrounds are maintained in the Telegraph Concession by the Naval authorities. The climate of Henjam is, however, extremely trying in the summer, and the view was expressed in 1903 that it would not be a suitable site for a defended naval establishment. 0 3. The island, the only place of importance on which is the village of Henjam, an Arab settlement dependent principally on pearl fishing, is inhabited by Arabs belonging to the Beni Yas tribe of the Arabian coast. The Beni YTis are said to have migrated to it from the Arabian coast about a century ago,| with the permission of the Sultan of Muscat, at a time when Henjam was definitely claimed and administered by that State. They are reported consistently to have refused to acknowledge Persian sovereignty or to accept Persian nationality, and to have made it clear that they would rather leave Henjam than become Persian subjects. They have inter married throughout with the Beni Y'as of the Arabian coast; their commercial dealings and their pearling ventures are all connected with that tribe ; their Sheikh is the father-in-law of the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai, and the ruling family of Dabai and their subjects claim to have 3^ lakhs of rupees sunk in the concerns of the Henjam branch of their tribe. 4. A Persian Customs agent has been maintained in the island since 1905, and a Customs post was established in the area of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s concession, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government, in 1927. There is also a Persian Post Office alongside the Customs House, the difficulties caused by the anti-British activities of the postmaster of which have come to notice on various occasions recently, and have formed the subject of representations at Teheran.J International Status of Henjam. 5. The international status of Henjam has formed the subject of considerable discussion in the past, claims being preferred to it by Muscat and by tne Trucial Sheikh of Dabai (subject, however, to the overriding claim of Muscat§) as well as by Persia. The Persian claim is based on the assertion that Henjam is and always has been a Persian possession, dependent from Bunder Abbas, and that such authority as was exercised in it in the first half of the last century by Muscat was exercised by that State under its lease from Persia of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies.

G. C’areful examination of the available evidence suggests that the claims of Muscat are substantial . 0 But despite the representations in favour of Muscat of the then Political Resident, Persian sovereignty was formally recognised in 18G8 by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India; in the year 1904 His Majesty’s Government further informed the Persian Government that “ there was no intention ... to support any such claim [to sovereignty] on the part of the Sheikh of Dabai, or to repudiate the authority of the Persian Government over Henjam ”; and their recognition of Persian suzerainty has been reiterated on various occasions since that date, and particularly in the last two years.f In the circumstances, while the Muscat claim has never been abandoned, it seems impracticable for His Majesty’s Government, in view of their consistent recognition of Persian sovereignty over the last 60 years, to take any action at this stage to challenge the position of Persia. The British Telegraph Concession at Henjam. 7. The basis of the position in Hen jam of His Majesty’s Government is the Telegraph Goncession secured from the Persian Government in 1868. Prior to that date the occupation of Henjam (with the approval of the Imam of Muscat, under whose effective control the island then was) had been considered in 1820 in connection with the removal to the south Persian coast of the British military detachment stationed on the Arabian coast at Ras-al-Khaima; but, as in the case of Basidu (cp. Memorandum on p. |||, para. |g), an emphatic repudiation of the power of Muscat, “itself a dependency of Persia,” to grant concessions in Henjam and Kishm, “which are dependencies of Bandar Abbas,” was received from Persia and the matter was not pursued. 8 . There appear to have been no developments of importance until 1865. In that 3 eai the tiansfer to the island of the telegraph station maintained on Cape Musandim on the Arabian coast was proposed bv the Indian 1 elegiaph authoiities. After considerable discussion as to the rival claims to suzerainty of Persia and Muscat, it was decided in 1868 that Persia was the only Power which could object to the establishment of the station on the island, and it was agieed that a formal request for permission for its election should be made to the Persian Government by His Majesty’s Minister in Teheran. ^ J ' ^ 9. Ihe necessary sanction was granted by the Shah on 29th March 1868 subject to a proviso that “ the number of employees and the extent of the i s 101 ' c not at an y t i me l )e allowed to exceed those explained in the Memorandum received from the British Legation.” The exact scope of the concession, and the area within which it was to operate, havino- subsequently formed the subject of considerable controversy with Persia it may be placed on record that the Memorandum in question stipulated for a stall of lo Europeans, to include a Telegraph Superintendent and his assistant, an apothecary, and a storekeeper; and for a tele^ranh office containing instrument room, battery rooms, Superintendent’s office •verandah, &amp;c. a dwelling house for the Superintendent and his assistant ’ a janack foi 10 or 1_ clerks, a house for apothecary and medical stores • a large shed for telegraph stores and material; a house for the storekeepei and a shed for inferior material and coal store for the telegraph steamei’ when cruising, together with sundry out-offices for cookino- houses naHve Th, c.u. to b „ n la ;, u ; j,; ' “* ‘ •*«* •» w„ 10. The telegraph station was maintained from 1868-9 to 1 S 8 I when Its abandonment was approved. Proposals for the transfer to Henimn nf the naval coal depot at Basidu and the acquisition of the island from Persia in exchange for Basidu were considered in ]865-6 1872 and 18S0— — 3 They were abandoned in 1866 and 1872 owing to the disputed sovereignt}* of the island, and were finally dropped in 1880 in view of the decision to close down the telegraph station. No formal notification of the abandonment of the station in 1881 appears to have been made to Persia.* 11. The possibilities afforded by Hen jam were next brought to notice in 1901,f in connection with the discussions then engaging His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, on the question of naval bases, and of the consolidation of the British position in the Gulf. In 1903 the Government of Indiaf recommended the reoccupation of the telegraph station, which, they pointed out, had never been formally resumed by Persia, and the linking through it of Bandar Abbas with the Persian Gulf telegraphs—a question of some strategical importance. 12. After further investigation of the rival claims of Basidu, the Government of India’s proposal was approved by His Majesty’s Government early in 1904. Considerable discussion took place on the question of the communication, if any, to be made on the subject to Persia. It was finally decided to inform Persia of the intention to re-establish the telegraph station, and to ask for permission to extend the cable to Bandar Abbas§ ; and, action on these lines having been taken, the site of the former concession was reoccupied in April 1904, in advance of the conclusion, in March 1905, jj of a formal agreement with Persia. It may be noted that the agreement, when concluded, provided for the establishment by Persia of a Persian telegraph office on the island. 13. In July 1904 an unfounded report of the removal by the British telegraph authorities of the Persian flag at Henjam led to a protest by Persia, in replying to which IIis Majesty’s Minister explicitly stated that “His Majesty’s Government has never denied the sovereignty of Persia over Henjam, as is shown by the fact that our occupation is derived by the concession granted to us by His Majesty the late Shah.”^f 14. The re establishment of the station roused Persian suspicions of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government. Flagstaffs were erected, and in November 1904 a customs official was appointed to the island and a customs post established by him within the limits of the concession. A lengthy controversy took place as to the precise boundaries of the Telegraph Concession (Persia maintaining** that the Firman of 1868, referred to in para. 9 above, granted accommodation only and not land), in the course of which His Majesty’s Government intimated that the fact of former occupation from 1869-81 was regarded by them as equivalent to a formal concession of the land then held. The dispute on this point, after an offer by His Majesty’s Government to apply if necessary for a formal concession of the land on the previous understanding that the request would be favourably entertained, was finally dropped on the question of the precise area of the land which was to be considered as having been alienated by Persia. The Persian Government explained that their difficulty in coming to a settlement arose to some extent from a fear for a demand for corresponding concessions in the north from Russia. 15. The effect on the local Arabs of the reassertion of Persian authority, and the serious difficulties which have arisen since 1904 owing to the Arab attitude towards Persian claims to sovereignty, are dealt with separately in the Note on the Sheikh of Henjam and his affairs in paras. 25 to 34 below. 16. From 1911 the Naval authorities and the Telegraph Concession used Henjam as their chief base in the Gulf, and in 1912 the naval coaling station was removed to it from Basidu (in which, however, a nominal depot was retained), depcts being built within the area of the telegraph station. With a short interval in 1915, it has been maintained since that date.|t A coaling pier was completed in 1921. JJ No communication appears to have been made to Persia regarding the establishment of the coal depot, and it was agreed that, should the matter be raised by her, the depot should be represented as having been established in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic.

The question of negotiating with Tersia an exchange of Basidn or Henjam was again examined in 1911,* but was not pursued, while in 1 JI4 and again in 1918 the purchase or lease from Persia of Henjam and ceitain other islands in the Gulf was considered, a formal offer being made to Persia in respect of them in 1914, but without result. 1926-8: Reassertion of Persian Claims. 18. Up to 1926 naval stores “ in transit ” to His Majesty s ships and for use in the concession had been landed at Henjam without payment of customs dues and without reference to the Persian customs. A claim for payment of duty was for the first time made by Persia in May 192b ; and in October of the same year His Majesty’s Minister decided that customs, monopoly, and road tax must be admitted. The duties in question have apparently been levied since that date. No taxes are, however, levied on Government stores landed at Henjam for transhipment to naval vessels, the Persian Government having agreed in 192&lt; to the establishment of a bonded warehouse for such stores.f 19. In July 1926 enquiry by the Persian Government as to the rights of property of His Majesty’s Government in Basidn and Henjam led to a re-examination of the position of Ilis Majesty’s Government in those stations. The Admiralty urged the desirability of retaining the Henjam concession and regularising the position in respect of it. Not only w 7 as the retention of the coal depot essential, since three out of the four vessels employed in the Gulf were still coal-burning, but the station offered the only recreational facilities in the Gulf for men of the squadron. Tire Government of India, in expressing agreement with the views of the Admiralty, referred to the strategical importance of a coaling station at the mouth of the Gulf. An endeavour to conclude an arrangement with Persia on the basis of surrender of the British position in Basidu in return for consolidation of that in Henjam was in contemplation, but the Minister at Teheran having reported that in the present state of Persian opinion “ it would he impossible to obtain perpetual lease of Henjam in return for BasiduJ ” ; and it having proved possible to avoid further discussion of the general question with Persia, the matter dropped for the time being. 20. During 1927 there arose difficulty with Persia (to which suspicions of the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government for the activities of the Sheikh of Henjam—see para. 28 below—contributed) as the result of the erection within the limits of the concession of a house for the Persian postmaster without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government, and again in connection with the expulsion of a Persian nakhuda who had without permission built a hut within the concession. An amicable settlement of both incidents were secured, and both the Minister and the Political Resident made ic cleai to the Belgian customs officials that Bis Majesty’s Government had no claim to or designs on the island, and wanted no more than the control of the concession for sanitary reasons. The customs officials reacted favourably to a suggestion that Basidu might be surrendered in return for consolidation of the position at Henjam, but the matter was not pursued A site for a new Customs House within the limits of the British concession was agreed with the British authorities. 21. On the occasion of the expulsion of the Sheikh of Henjam in Mav 1928, not only was the Sheikh refused permission to take refuge in the British concession, but 1 ersian troops were allowed to occupy the concession a guarantee being given by their commander that British lives and interests would be respected. Persian sovereignty even within the limits of the concession was thus recognised in a practical manner. F.O. tel. to Teh., 196, Sept. 19 1928, P. 5210. 22. In September 1928 the Admiralty reported that a number of Persian troops had arrived in llenjam, 15 of whom had crossed into the British concession, and the Charge d’Affaires at Teheran was instructed that semi-official action for their removal should be taken on the ground of the inconvenience caused by them, and of the fact that while Persia’s riclit to send troops into the concession in case of need was not disputed no real necessity existed in the present instance. ’23. The incidents at Tamb and Basidu in the summer of 1928 necessitated consideration of the action to be taken at Hen jam in the event of Persian aggression under the Telegraph Concession there; and in September 1928 the Admiralty suggested that the Senior Naval Officer should be authorised to take action on the lines approved in the case of Basidu (compare page ^ , para. 25). The Foreign Office, however, expressed the view that, having regard to the weakness of the British position at Henjam, and to the desirability of regularising that position, in agreement with Persia, and of securing the maintenance of the use of the concession as a naval depot and recreation ground, for which Persian permission had never been obtained, the Senior Naval Officer should be instructed that conflict with the Persian authorities in the island, military or civil, should be avoided in all circumstances save in a grave emergency when British lives and property are in danger, and that even then force should be used only in the last resort. Henjam Wireless Station. 24. The history of the wireless station established at Hen jam in 1916, the present importance of that station, and the threat to its continued maintenance constituted by the Persian prohibition of the import of spare parts, is dealt with in the Memorandum on Wireless in the Gulf on page j||. Relations between the Sheikh of Henjam and Persia: 1904-28. 25. The Arab Sheikh of Henjam, now over 80 years of age, is the direct descendant of the Arab leader to whom permission to occupy Henjam was granted by the Sultan of Muscat about 1826. He is the hereditary ruler of the Arabs of the Beni Yas tribe who inhabit the island ; he claims, as do his people, never to have acquiesced in Persian claims to sovereignty over Henjam or to have acquired Persian nationality, and so recently as 1927 he informed the Officer Commanding H.M.S. Lupin that he regarded action in Henjam by the Persian customs authorities against his property as a violation of his rights, as he considered himself a subject of the Sultan of Muscat.”'* The general attitude of the Sheikh and his subjects on the question of Persian nationality, and their close relations with the Trucial Sheikhdoms of the Arab coast, and particularly with Habai, are described in para. 3 above. 26. His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, have, as already stated, consistently held that the island of Henjam belongs to Persia, and that the claims of the Sultan of Muscat, on which the Sheikh of Henjam to some extent bases his attitude, cannot be entertained. 27. The gradual assertion of Persian authority in the island since the establishment on it of a customs port in 1904 (see para. 14 above) has led during the last 25 years to considerable friction between the local Persian officials and the Arab inhabitants. Tension was particularly marked between 1904 and 1907,| during wffiich period an appeal to the Sultan of MuscatJ by the Henjam Arabs led to a visit to the island by His Highness in 1905, and a formal protest by him to His Majesty’s Government against Persian action. A proposal to transfer the Arabs to Basidu was rejected by His Majesty’s Government in 1906 on political grounds. Difficulty again arose in 1914.§ A serious incident would appear to a large extent to have been avoided in the past owing to the knowledge of the Sheikh that His Majesty’s Government recognise Persian sovereignty, and the fact that the Persian customs post lies within the boundary of the British concession. 28. Ill-leeling of long standing came to a head, however, in April 1927, when, consequent on the seizure by the Persian customs officials of a dhow belonging to the Sheikh of Henjam en route to Khassab on the Arabian coast and carrying Ps. 3,000 in cash, the customs post, though within the British concession, was attacked and looted by the Sheikh and his followers, the Customs Mudir being killed, the local Persian Postmaster wounded, and more serious disturbances being prevented only by the landing of a Adm. to F.O., Sept. 15 1928.

British naval party, the valuable services rendered by which were gratefully acknowledged subsequently by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. 29. The Sheikh was rebuked by the Senior Naval Officer for his encroachment on the territory of the concession, which was, he alleged, the ^ result of misunderstanding; and was reminded that he had been warned f in June 192b that should Persia take punitive action against him he need not look for protection to His Majesty’s Government. 30. The Customs Mudir was replaced towards the end of 1927, but punitive action by Persia was delayed till the spring of 1928. In May of that year an armed Persian force landed on the island and expelled the Sheikh, who fled with his subjects to the Trucial Coast, leaving behind certain of the women of the tribe. He had been warned that if he sought refuge in the British Concession he would be surrendered, and the Persian troops on arrival were permitted to enter and camp in the concession on the ground that it was Persian territory. 31. The expulsion of the Sheikh, and in particular the fact that he had been refused shelter in the British Concession, produced a serious situation on the Arab coast (see paras 18 and 19 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. jjH ). The Political Resident, apprehensive of the effect on Trucial feeling of the adoption of a. detached attitude by His Majesty’s Govermnent, suggested that His Majesty’s Government might act 'as intermediaries, with a view to ascertaining whether Persia would be prepared to accept any terms on which the Sheikh could return on acknowledging Persian sovereignty and paying blood money. His Majesty’s Government, in agreement with the Government of India and the Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, decided, however, that intervention on behalf'of the Sheikh would be likely to do more harm than good ; that a local settlement was clearly the right solution, and that if any influence was exercised with Persia it should be both unobtrusive and local. 32. The question of action on behalf of the Sheikh, in view of the situation on the Prucial Coast, 'where feeling, further aggravated by the Tamb incident, continued to run high, formed the subject of considerable discussion during August and September 1928. In September 1928 the Sheikh of Dabai reported, however, that a Persian Envoy from Henjam had arrived inviting the Sheikh and all his people, except the actual murderers of the Mudir, to return; and the Senior Naval Officer, aware of the reluctance of His Majesty s Government to intervene, advised that the Sheikh of Henjam must decide for himself. On 2Uth September the Political Resident reported that the Sheikh, with his men, had returned to Henjam, where he was understood to be awaiting the arrival of PermAn officials to effect a settlement.- 33. Matters rest at this point. The Government of India had previously suggested that the Trucial situation now made it desirable to inform the Dabai Arabs that while His Majesty’s Government could not admit “non- amenability of Sheikh of fienjam, as a resident on soil recognised by us as Persian, to Persian authority in respect of his Henjam holding we are prepared to represent views of Sheikh of Dabai and Beni Yas tribe ... to Persian Government and use our good offices on behalf [of the Sheikh of Henjam] provided he is prepared to make full restitution for the murder of Customs Mudir. Matter might then be dealt with in autumn negotiations on basis of full acknowledgment of Persian sovereignty over Hem'am Issue of nationality should be avoided if possible, but, if it is *o be raised' capital could be made ... of status of (?

The Government v,,. uvcu aaiveu wnetner tiieir views are affected by the return of the Sheikh to Henjam. The Charo-e d’Affaires Teheran, who had sounded the Persian Government as to the return of the Sheikh, has meanwhile expressed the view that failing a specific umWrnT Ao- by Persia that he “ be permitted to return in full liberty, he runs a certam risk, and we cannot accept responsibility for Avhat may happen.” t $ \ I W -Summary. 35. The island of Henjam has been recognised by His Majesty's Government on several occasions as a Persian possession in terms such as to preclude a challenge to the Persian claim based on support of the rival claims of Muscat. The position in the island of His Majesty’s Government depends solely, in law, on the concession granted for a telegraph station in 1868. That concession in terms permitted only the erection and maintenance of certain specified buildings, and the retention of a specified staff, for telegraph purposes. The wireless station subsequently erected, the naval coal depot, the naval canteen and recreation grounds, all therefore represent an encroachment by His Majesty’s Government for which legal justification cannot be pleaded. 36. The position of His Majesty’s Government in the island is further complicated by the fact that the Arab inhabitants, who claim to be Trucial subjects, and who dispute Persian sovereignty, tend to look to us for protection against Persia. The reactions on liritish interests on the Trucial Coast of the attitude towards them of His Majesty’s Government make it extremely desirable to take any action reasonably possible in their interests. Any such action, at the same time, is viewed with deep suspicion by Persia, and represents from the Persian standpoint an additional argument for terminating the British connection with the island. 37. The importance of maintaining that connection is, however, con siderable. The strategic value of control of an island which commands the mouth of the Gulf, which has a good water supply and a good anchorage, needs no emphasis. The maintenance of the coaling depot at present situated on it is desirable so long as the Persian Gulf Squadron contains coal burning units; while the recreational facilities at present afforded to that squadron at Henjam are not available elsewhere in the Gulf. As will be seen from the Memorandum on Wireless on pages £S to 0, the island is of substantial importance in connection with wireless arrangements in the Gulf, while it might conceivably be of importance in certain circumstances in connection with the air route. 38. The omens are not favourable to the conclusion with Persia of an arrangement on lines satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, who have little to offer in exchange. It seems likely, as matters stand, that an offer to surrender the position at present occupied by His Majesty’s Government in Basidu as the price of regularisation of the position in Henjam will prove less attractive to Persia than had at one time been hoped. It may, however, prove possible as part of the general settlement to secure the retention of the Telegraph concession, contracted to the essential needs of His Majesty’s Government, on a long lease from Persia, on the basis of recognition, as at present, of full Persian sovereignty, and the importance of obtaining this may be held to justify the making of concessions in return to Persia which would in other circumstances have been disproportionate. Should it unfortunately prove impossible to arrive at an understanding with Persia, the arguments for consideration of the practicability of establishing a station on the Musandim Peninsula will be very appreciably strengthened. 39. The importance of the Sheikh of Henjam and his affairs derives from his connection with the Trucial Coast rather than with Henjam. It is to be hoped that the matter may have adjusted itself before negotiations with Persia are resumed. Should it not have done so, the balance of advantage appears, on a broad view, to lie with representations on his behalf to Persia by His Majesty’s Government in the capacity of the disinterested friend of both parties, on the general lines set out in para. 33 above, coupled with the exercise of such pressure as is possible on the Sheikh and his subjects to recognise the status quo in Henjam. Points referred to the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 40. The following points have been referred to in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee : — (a) Position of His Majesty’s Government in Basidu, Kishm and Henjam (P.G. 6 2 (a) 5). *8 Tel. from Viceroy, 1685 S., Aug. 22 1928, P. 455U/28.

(b) Whether the existing coaling depots on Kishm [Basidn] and Henjam can without disadvantage be moved to Bahrein? (Conclusions of 1st meeting of Sub-Committee.) Views expressed by the Government of India. 41. The Government of India, who recognise that His Majesty’s Govern ment have no rights of ownership in Henjam, consider that “ the naval advantages offered by Henjam with its deep anchorage render regularisatiou of our position desirable, and we still feel that we should seek to receive this in exchange for our firmer rights in Basidu, a solution as old as our original occupation in 1868 [cp. para. 10, supra]. Not that we anticipate possibility of acquiring a lease in perpetuity. The time appears to have passed for any such veiled form of transfer of sovereignty. Long lease or concession seems all that we can now hope for. We should be prepared to contract area to our essential needs.” 42. On the question of the practicability of moving the coaling station from Henjam to Bahrein, the Government of India, while they remark that it is primarily a matter for the Admiralty, consider that prima facie the move is practicable. The Political Resident, who refers to the fact that the Henjam anchorage “ is absolutely indefensible from guns placed on Kishm Island,” has suggested on this point that His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to consider moving elsewhere, but that “ if the Persians attempt to make us move, then we must demand sufficient time to prepare some other place, and must avoid any idea of being turned out in an undignified manner.” India Office, 26th September 1928.

(1917), Sultan of Muscat and Oman, born in 1885, succeeded his father, Sultan Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.O.I.E., who had ruled the Sultanate since 1888, in 1918. He has three sons, of whom the eldest, Saiyid Said, is being educated at an Arab school in Baghdad. His Highness, who is entitled to a salute of 21 guns, represented his father at the Delhi Durbar, 1902—3, and visited England in the summer of 1928, when he was received in audience by the King, and entertained as a State guest for a period of a month. 2 . The Sultan is an independent potentate who lias commercial treaties with the Governments of France (1814) and the United States (1833), as well as with His Majesty’s Government. There is in addition a commercial declaration of 1877 with the Dutch Government. Under the Anglo-French declaration of 1862, His Majesty’s Government and the French Government engage reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat (as of the Sultan of Zanzibar). Under Ids treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, a precis of which is contained in the memorandum printed as an Appendix on page the Sultan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, his dominions, save to His Majesty’s Government, to whom, in addition, the right to search and seize Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves was ceded in 1373, as was the right (simultaneously ceded to Persia) to search Muscat vessels tor arms in Muscat waters in 1898. The right to search Muscat vessels for arms on the high seas was ceded to His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government in 1903. His Highness has further undertaken not to grant oil concessions without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. While, however, the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat, and in practice the relations which obtain between its ruler and His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India very closely approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. 3. The internal administration of Muscat is carried out by an Advisory Council of Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs, Minister of Justice)/' purely Arab with the exception noted below, * p. 937 / 24 . assistance of Mis Majesty tration and in negotiations with the rebel Omani tribes (see para. 35), is entitled to a salute of 17 guns, individual members receiving five and the P-H. 321 / 22 . President nine, or 13 if a member of the ruling House. In theory it exercises all ordinary powers of administration, not only during the absence, but during the presence of the Sultan at Muscat, subject to the retention by His Highness of power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty.^ It does not, however, l g. &lt;&gt;f 1 . Desp. to appear in the past to have exercised in practice a very effective control. At Mar. 3 , mu the request of the Sultan, an Englishman, Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., P. 1969 / 21 , formerly assistant British representative in Trans-Jordan,§ was appointed in § Letter 41 s s. from 1925 as Financial Adviser. In 1926 Mr. Thomas was appointed Wazir and j°{ y ^ s j^ 4 G - of u a member of the Muscat Council, functioning as Finance Minister, but having also a full share in the government of the State. The result has been a marked improvement in the general level of efficiency of administration. 4 . His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented in Muscat by the Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Political Department, on the cadre of which the appointment is borne.

P. 3588/21. o L-i post, which is at present held by Major G. P. Murphy, Indian Arm}’, has been maintained without interruption since its revival'*' after the separation of Muscat from Zanzibar in 1801. In 1869 it was placed in strict subordination to the Political Pesident in the Persian Gulf.t Since 1867 the Political Agent has also held His Majesty’s Commission as Consul lor Muscat. Under the Muscat Order in Council of 1915 (see paras. Od-4 4ft below), which replaced the Muscat Order in Council of 1867, the Political m Agent is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The limits of the Order are co-extensive with the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 5. Xo specific reference was made to Muscat in the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, and while, under the general principle embodied in that Committee, matters of political significance on the north Arabian littoral which may affect relations with Ibn Sand fall to be dealt with by or in consultation with the Colonial Office, such matters rarely, if at all, arise in Muscat, and political control may in consequence be regarded as resting, as in the pre-war period, with the Government of India, subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government. Under the principles embodied in the Masterton-Smith Report, the internal affairs of the State are in any event the direct concern of the Government of India. 6. With the inconsiderable exception referred to below, expenditure in Muscat is wholly borne by Indian revenues. That expenditure consists of subsidies to the Sultan, of Durbar presents, and of the cost of maintaining the Political Agency. The subsidies consist of an annual sum of Rs. 86,400, representing the $40,000 payable by Zanzibar to Muscat under the Canning award of 1861 (liability for this payment was assumed by His Majesty’s Government in 1871, and has since 1st September 1883 been wholly an Indian charge),J and of the annual subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh paid since 1912 (see paras. 12 and 22 below) in compensation for the losses to the Sultan arising out of the suppression of the arms traffic, which will cease with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. These charges are fixed, and their amount does not vary. In the latest year for which authoritative figures are available (1919-20), the cost of the Political Agency was Rs. 78,427, and in the same year Durbar presents amounted to Rs. 5,000.§ The solitary item of expenditure shared with His Majesty’s Government is a yearly payment in respect of anti-slavery measures, the amount of which in 1926 was Rs. 73. I i A &gt; * II.— 1908 to 4th October 1913 : Sultan Faisal. 6. The dominating feature of the period between 1908 and 1913 is the successful suppression, in agreement with the Sultan of Muscat, of the arms traffic from his State, and no other question of sufficiently general ^ ^ interest to call for reference in this Memorandum arose in the closing years of the reign of Sultan Faisal. The rebellion of the Omani tribes, which broke out some months before ins death on 4th October 1913, belongs principally to the reign of his successor. It is dealt with in a separate section in paras. 43 to 52 beloAv. The Suppression of the Arms Traffic from Muscat. 7. At the beginning of the period a general prohibition of the arms traffic was in force on the Persian Gulf littoral save in Muscat. The Sultan of Muscat had prohibited in 1891 the import or export of arms and ammunition to or from Gwadur, his dependency on the Persian littoral of the Gulf. In 1898 iiis Highness had agreed to prohibit the export of arms from Muscat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal), and had empowered Persia and Great Britain to act on his behalf by sea in enforcing this prohibition within Muscat territorial waters. In 1903 he had further agreed to the search by British and Italian ships of Muscat vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying arms. But the import of arms into Muscat, and their export, except to India and Persia, were still unprohibited in 1908.■■■Hi mm 8. The result was to make Muscat the recognised centre of the trade in arms for the whole Middle East. At the beginning of the period novv in question, the main channel of distribution was from Muscat across the to the coast of Persian Makran, whence arms were taken xip country by caravans, ultimately reaching the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North- • West Frontier of India. From 1910-11, the stringency of the prohibitive measures imposed by His Majesty s Government led to the adoption, in preference, of smuggling to El Katr. on the Arabian coast, then still under Turkish control, and thence across the Gulf to the Persian coast of Laristan. 9. The constant flow of modern arms of precision from Muscat to the North-West Frontier of India created a very serious situation for the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. The situation was one which could be dealt with adequately only by the suppression of the free trade in arms at Muscat. The fact that the Sultan had commercial treaties not only with His Majesty’s Government, but with the United States of America and France, which expressly provided for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions); that he had further a commercial declaration which provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between Muscat and Holland; that a large part of the trade in arms was in the hands of certain French firms with considerable political influence in the Chamber ; and that the French Government, unlike the Governments of the United States of America and Holland, was not prepared to sacrifice its treaty rights provided other Treaty Powers did the same, made it extremely difficult to take effective steps to this end. I.O. Memo. B. 175, 182, 196. 10. The efforts made by His Majesty’s Government to provide a quid pro quo acceptable to the French Government having failed, steps were taken, in the light of a reiteration at the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-9 of the refusal of France to modify her attitude, to suppress the traffic so far as was practicable without the violation of existing treaty rights. Towards the end of 1909 a naval blockade was instituted, which was still in being on the outbreak of the War in 1914, but which, though it met with very considerable success, proved extremely costly. Between 1910 and^ 19UJ further lengthy negotiations took place in consequence with the hrench Government and with the Sultan. The Sultan, who saw in the suppression of the traffic not merely a possible occasion of immediate compensation from His Majesty’s Government, but the closing of the most convenient source from which the rebellious tribes in the interior of Oman could arm themselves against him, was generally amenable, though in 1911-12 his financial difficulties, which delivered him into the hands of the arms dealeis, • led him y ic ^y' to g“ of g for a time to change from an attitude of neutrality towards the trade, to active, f or i., jan. 141911 , if surreptitious, participation in it. The French Government, however, p. 10 , p. 200 . remained unyielding, and in view of the complete failure of the negotiations with them, it was decided to disregard France, and to endeavour to concert with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangements for a satisfactory control +IO toFO&gt; of the trade.t Ju h 1919n - 11. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various incidents which took place in connection with the suppression of the traffic between 1910 and 1912, or to enter into details of the discussions which took place during that period with the Sultan and with France. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was finally reached with His Highness in May 1912, Under this the Sultan agreed to establish at Muscat a bonded warehouse under sufficient control, in which all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation, the warehouse to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects. All issues from the warehouse would be regulated by special licences prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by the Sultan personally, and such licences would be issued only t 0 individual purchasers or their authorised agents subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was “ free from justifiable objection.” Licences would not be issuable to traders. 12. The terms on which the Sultan agreed to this settlement were as follows. He was to receive as compensation an immediate lump sum4 t P.5179/13.

In addition he was to receive compensation for certain specific losses in 1909 and 1911. The Sultan was further guaranteed that His Majesty’s Government would give him all the necessary support to dispose of objections that might ensue from France or other Powers ; that no right was given by the arrangement to His Majesty’s Government or their officials to take action in his territories any more than in the past; and that a friendly understanding should be reached with him by His Majesty’s Government as to suitable arrangements for the supply of the bond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. 13. The arrangement, which was to come into force, after three months’ notice, on the 1st September 1912, was published on the 4th June 1912, came into operation on the appointed date, and was subsequently maintained with complete success. 14. Very serious difficulty immediately arose with the French Government, which expressed its readiness to approve the regulations only subject to the compensation of the French merchants, who had hitherto played a consider able part in the arms trade. Compensation to French interests would have meant compensation to the other interests—Muscat, British, German, Belgian—affected, and the objections to it from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government were overwhelming. The fact that Fngland, while a joint guarantor with France of Muscat independence under the Agreement with France of 1862, was not a party to the French Treaty of 1844 with Muscat, under which the arms trade was permissible, further complicated the issue. 15. His Majesty’s Government, however, made it clear to the French Government on the 14th September 1912, that they were firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations, which, they stated, in their view did not infringe French treaty rights, but merely regulated a dangerous trade, a right enjoyed by every Government. They added that, while compensation without arbitration could not be admitted, as His Majesty’s Government did not recognise that French rights were infringed, they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration. 16. After lengthy and difficult negotiations, which lasted until the early part of 1914, the French Government agreed 0 to recognise the regulations in force at Muscat, and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government, if His Majesty’s Government, m direct negotiation with the French trade interests affected could arrive at an agreement as to the terms on which those interests should be bought out. An agreement having been reached,! under which £64,495 was paid by His Majesty’s Government to the interested firms, an exchange of notes took place on 4th February 1914, by the settlement embodied in which the trench Government undertook ‘‘no longer to claim for their nationals the privileges and immunities secured under the Treaty between France and Muscat of 1844, in so far as those privileges and immunities conflict with the regulations for the prevention of the illicit trade inarms and ammunition in the Sultanate. In other respects the Treaty of 1844 remains in force.” The expenditure involved was divided equally between Indian and Imperial revenues.t Jt was decided that no compensation should be paid to British firms aflected. 17. While a continual vigilance is called for, the steps taken to put a stop to the arms traffic from Muscat, as described above have been completely successful. In 1921,§ and again in 1925,j| the Political Resident was able to report that, save for the Batineh coast, on which a truculent Omani tribe (Jhe 1 al Saad) are not under the Sultan’s effective control (c/. para. 52), Muscat had entirely fallen out of the arms traffic ; and the fact that under the post-war Arms Traffic Convention, to which the Sultan has adhered at the request of His Majesty’s Government,^ Arabia had been made a prohibited area for the import or export of arms, has for practical purposes disposed of the probability of the recurrence in present circumstances of international difficulties. » \ V -rIII.—-Internal History of Muscat from Accession of Sultan Taimur, 4th October 1913 to 1928. 18. Sultan Faisal died on 4th October 1 ( J13. :;: ‘ His son, Saiyid Taimur, had in practice, if not formally, for some years previously been recognised as heir apparent,! and while His Majesty’s Government had in the past in ^Muscat postponed recognition of a successor until they were satisfied that a particular claimant was assured of the general support of the more important ‘dements and could be regarded as the de facto ruler, the demise of the late Sultan at a time when the interior was in a state of revolt, the urgent necessity of establishing a fresh administrative centre, and the fact that Saiyid Taimur was familiar with the policy of his predecessor, and could •probably be relied upon to follow that policy in the vital matter of the arms traffic, decided them in favour of his immediate recognition.J This the Political Agent was authorised to convey to the Saiyid in November 1913. The French Government, who had suggested that the two Governments reconnaissent en meme temps the new ruler,§ were informed that while His Majesty’s Government, as they had already indicated, adhered to the Declaration of 18G2, it was their usual practice to recognise the de facto ruler, and that they had accordingly already authorised the Government of India to take this step in the case of Sultan Taimur, especially as they understood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instructions by his British colleague himself to accord official recognition on behalf of France. 19. But the recognition had not been unconditional. The new Sultan had been required as a prior condition to state that he accepted all the obligations which his father bore towards His Majesty’s Government, and that in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters he intended to pursue his father’s policy, and undertook “to be guided by our advice in all important matters.”|J And, immediate recognition having been granted by His Majesty’s Government on compliance by the Saiyid with these preliminary demands, further requirements were presented to him as a condition of the continuance of the subsidies granted to his predecessor. 20. Of these subsidies the Zanzibar subsidy was one the precise ‘Conditions antecedent to the grant of which are a matter of some dispute.^ It would, however, appear that those conditions are that a Sultan should be acknowledged by His Majesty’s Government and should promise friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations, and that subject to this he might prefer an absolute claim. The arms traffic subsidy of lls. 1 lakh per annum had, however, been personal to Sultan Feisal, and, while it was essential that the new ruler should afford the co-operation in the suppression of the trade to secure which it had been granted, he could prefer no claim to it as of right. 21. After lengthy discussion between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office, it was finally decided that ihe Sultan should be required as a condition of the regrant of the subsidies to agree to postpone for five years, or such shorter period as His Majesty’s Government might desire, the revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1891**; a decision being deferred pending further examination on two connected questions—the assent of His Highness to the establishment of a Muscat Levy Corps, and his agreement to conclude no further treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. The second of these questions was one which had arisen towards the close of the reign of Sultan Faisal|t, the disposal of which presented political difficulties owing to the position of France vis-a-vis the State, and which was still under examination when the outbreak of the European War in August 1914 made its immediate pursuit unnecessary.^! It has not been revived. For various reasons the proposal to raise a Muscat Levy Corps (to which the Foreign Office saw no political objection in 1914§§ so long as the force was nominally a Muscat force and commanded by officers nominally in the service of the Sultan) produced no result until 1921 (see j)ara. 31). 22. The arms traffic subsidy was renewed without a very clear definition •of the terms of its renewal, though the intention both of His Majesty’s * P. 4116/13. t Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Oct. 20 1913, P. 4318/13. x F.O. to I.O., Oct. 31 1913, P. 4518. § M.

Government and the Government of India had been that, as in tne case of Sultan Feisal, it should be personal to the mler.^ The complete success of the restrictions imposed on the arms traffic, the extension to Arabia of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, and the financial stringency of the post war period, led at a later stage to re-examination oi the position in regard this subsidy, and as a result the Sultan was warned in 1922 that, while would he continued to him during his tenure of power, it would not be admissible to his successor. In this decision His Highness reluctantly acquiesced. 23. The dominating position in Muscat throughout the war was the rebellion of the Omani tribes, which Sultan Taiinur inherited as a legacy from his predecessor, which he found himself unable to quell on his accession, and the history of which is separately dealt with in paras. 43 to o2 of this Memorandum. The pre-occupation of the State with this problem absorbed its energies during the War period, while its relative remoteness from the politics of Central Arabia resulted in its isolation from the disputes of Ibn Sand and Ibn Rashid, and from the development of events alike at the head of the Gulf and on the coast of the Red Sea. 24. It is unnecessary to enter in any detail into the internal affairs of Muscat (as distinct from the Omani rebellion) in the early years of the war. The control of the arms traffic, itself no inconsiderable element in that rebellion, was on the whole satisfactorily maintained. I Jut the Sultan retained his throne thanks only to the active military assistance and support of His Majesty’s Government, a support not, extended to the administration of his State until 1918; his administration, never distinguished, became hopelessly corrupt; while His Highness’s financial position, as the result of the inefficiency of his servants, the demands of the campaign against the Omanis, and the loss of revenue involved in the Omani rebellion, gradually deteriorated until in 1918 it could be described as desperate.! 25. The Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, committed by their undertakings of 1895 and 1913 to secure the safety of the coast towns of Muscat and Muttrah (cp. para. 45), in the early part of the war confined their action to implementing these undertakings with some generosity of interpretation, and abstained from interference in the internal policy of the State. But the inefficiency of the internal administration, the action taken at the behests of His Majesty’s Government by the Sultan and his predecessor, and the Omani rebellion were closely interwoven; the strategic position of Muscat, athwart the main route to the headwaters of the Gulf and to Mesopotamia, was of vital interest; the nominal independence of the Sultan rendered his situation of more than local importance, and in 1917 the then Political Agent, Major Haworth, submitted for consideration a programme the acceptance of which would involve active interference in the internal affairs of Muscat by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. 20. The proposals of the Political Agent were that a levy corps should be established under British officers ; tliat a loan should be granted the Sultan sufficient to rid him of his liabilities; and that as a condition of the loan His Highness should agree to the transfer to British control of the Muscat customs, to the appointment of a British adviser and to the establishment of an educational system the ultimate result of which would be the provision of a nucleus of Muscat subjects educationally qualified for employment in the local administration, which had hitherto been wholly dependent on alien talent. 27. 5fajor Haw'orth’s proposals necessitated careful consideration in the light of the Declaration of 18G2, under which His Majesty’s Government had become a joint guarantor with France of the independence of Muscat. A further difficulty was the uncertainty as to the authority with which respon sibility for Muscat affairs would rest after the war, and the reluctance of the Government of India to initiate a policy the development of which was unlikely to rest with them. But circumstances forced the pace : negotiations with the Omani rebels in the spring of 1918 were unproductive, the financial7 situation became, if possible, more critical; the reactions of maladministration at home, alike on the financial situation and on relations with the tribes of the interior, became increasingly apparent; and in August 1918 the Government of India, after further discussion with Sir Percy Cox and Major Haworth, expressed to the Secretary of State for India the view that action could not &gt;l)e postponed indefinitely, and submitted proposals to meet the situation. 28. The Government of India suggested the offer to the Sultan of a loan of Rs. lakhs at 6 per cent, interest to be paid off in 10 years and to be secured on the Muscat customs ; the loan to be conditional on agreement by His Highness to undertake a definite programme of reform which would result in financial reorganisation and the improvement of the administration of justice. The Foreign Office did not consider 0 that the proposed loan could afford any ground for legitimate protest to the French Government, to whom no reference was accordingly made by His Majesty’s Government, and it was finally sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India on 4th December 1918.| It was borne wholly by Indian revenues, the Treasury refusing to contribute. + 29. The programme of reform accepted by the Sultan as a condition of the loan covered the following points :— Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Aug. 16 1918, P. 3661/18. * F.O. to I.O., Nov. 5 1918, P. 4913/18. f Tel. to Viceroy, Dec. 4 1918, P. 4913. £ Treasury to F.O., Jan. 10 1919 ; S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Feb. 14 1919, P. 371/19. (1) Appointment by His Highness of an Indian, to be selected by His Majesty’s Government, as Customs Director, who would in the first instance reorganise existing customs posts, and subsequently extend a customs system to all ports in Oman. (2) Fixation of amount of Privy Purse, remainder of State income being appropriated to charges of administration and payment of instalments and interest of loan. (3) Appointment of a Wazir or Dewan to conduct Courts of Justice and control proceedings of local governors of districts. (4) Improvement of roads, establishment of schools, &amp;c. (5) Reorganisation of Sultan’s guard with a view to its eventual use as nucleus for a levy corps. 30. Considerable discussion took place regarding these conditions in the early part of 1919, Sir Arnold Wilson, then Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, feeling serious doubt as to whether they did not at once constitute too heavy a commitment on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and traverse the principles of self-determination embodied in the post-war policy of the Allies. Thev were, however, ultimately substantially accepted by the authorities concerned, and were put into operation during 1919. It may be recorded for convenience at this point that the Commercial Treaty of 1891, which had been renewed for five years in 1914, was extended for one year in 1919, and has been extended yearly since that date. p.901/14. 31. An additional loan of Rs. 1 lakh, borne, like the original loan, by Indian revenues, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in February 1920, raising the total of the advance to Rs. 1% lakhs, repayment of which was to be made in 19 equal half-yearly instalments of Rs. 46.740. 5.§ 32. The very considerable degree of indirect control represented by the measures described in para. 29 was justified from the point of view of Muscat by their results. By the beginning of 1920 the Sultan’s debts had been discharged with the assistance of the additional loan ; steps had been taken to introduce financial order; the result of the appointment on 1st October 1919 of three trained Egyptian customs officials to reorganise the customs, which provided the major part of the revenue of the State, was seen in a balance in the Treasury on 1st October 1920 of Rs. 3^- lakhs, :| and a regular Court of Law, though with less immediately satisfactory results, had also been established. In addition, a European Wazir (Capt. McCollum, formerly Political Agent, Koweit) was employed from January to August 1920, when the reorganisation of the administration referred to in paras. 35-6 below renderedTit possible to dispense with his services. Early in 1921, a Muscat lew corps under a British officer, which has since been maintained at a strength varying between 200 and 250, and which is now recruited from the Makran coast, made possible the withdrawal of the Indian troops maintained § Tel. to Viceroy, Feb. 9 1930, P. 863/20.

Simultaneously with the reorganisation of the internal administration,, the steps referred to in para. 41) below were being taken to bring about a settlement with the Omani tribes. With the attainment of a settlement ii^ September 19^0, the State found itself solvent and in sight of a condition of political stability such as it had not previously enjoyed. 34. While, however, the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government had secured the results described above in the affairs of the State, the Sultan, an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler, who had at no stage displayed the qualities of character necessary in the ruler of Oman, saw in the new dispensation an opportunity to divest himself of his nominal responsibilities, and in March 1920, in a private interview with the Viceroy, expressed his desire to abdicate and to reside permanently in India. 35. Other considerations apart, the facts that the tribal situation was still critical, that there was no obvious successor, and that the succession was a matter of more than local interest in view of the Sultan’s international treaties, rendered the proposal inopportune. Lord Chelmsford declined, to countenance it, and His Highness was required to return to Muscat on the conclusion of his visit. But the Sultan was in name at least independent; his reluctant co-operation might do more harm than good, and a compromise, which by reducing Mis Highness’s interference with the administration might simplify the task of reorganisation, was not altogether without advantage. As a result, the Omani tribes having in the autumn of 1920 asked that negotiations might be reopened, the Political Agent, after personal consulta tion with the Government of India, was authorised to inform the Sultan that His Majesty’s Government were willing to assist him in the continued reconstruction of his finances and in his negotiations with the rebels on the following conditions :— (a) That if he persisted in his wish to live away from his State as- much as possible, he should spend not less than five months every year continuously at Muscat. (b) That he should authorise the constitution of a regular Advisory Council, purely Arab in composition, to exercise all the ordinary powers of administration, not only during his absence, but during the periods of his presence at Muscat. (c) That he should retain the power to decide ail matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty. (d) That should he at any time change his mind and decide to live permanently at Muscat, these arrangements should be cancelled, and lie should resume all powers of administration, subject to the conditions of the loan maOe to him by His Majesty’s Government (see para. 28 above). 3f&gt;. After lengthy discussions these conditions were accepted by His Highness subject to the reduction of the period of his obligatory annual residence at Muscat and to the fixation of his privy purse at Rs. 10,000 per mensem. The Government of India agreed to modify their requirements; the period of residence was fixed at four months and subsequently reduced to three ; and approval was given to a privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem subject to His llighness’s continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain. An arrangement on these lines has since been in operation. 37. The financial position gave ground for increasing uneasiness in 1923- and 1924. Trade depression had reacted on the customs revenue; the Egyptian customs officials had not proved an unqualified success—one had been dismissed while another had resigned ; efforts at retrenchment, and the imposition of certain minor taxes, produced no substantial result. A large increase in revenue could be secured only by an increase in the customs duty from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., and the existence of treaties between Muscat and France and the (J.S.A., fixing that duty at 5 per cent., made action on these lines difficult.Lor. i, 417-!&gt;.

The Oman Rebellion, 1913-21. 43. Up to 1783 the capital of Muscat and Oman was at Rastaq in the interior. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spiritual ruler of the country, had, in accordance with the tenets of the Ibadhi sect of Islam, been elected by the people. The transfer of the capital to the coast of Muscat relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control to which they had hitherto been subject, while the fact that from the usurpation of Saiyid Sultan in 1793 the formality of election had been dispensed with, enabled them to regard their nominal ruler as a usurper. The relations with heretical foreign Powers which followed the transfer of the capital and the progressive degeneration in the capacity of the ruling house by which that transfer was accompanied, further weakened the position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the Omani tribes; and a series of rebellions between 1829 and 1867 culminated in the temporary seizure of power (1868-71) by a representative of a younger branch of the ruling family supported by the tribes. 44. The usurper was overthrown in 1871 by the legitimate branch; but between that date and 1913 numerous attempts were made by the Omani tribes to dethrone the Sultans, whose survival as rulers may fairly be said to have been due solely to the support of His Majesty’s Government. In the years immediately before the war, tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the importation of arms,* following on the suppression of the slave trade, both of them measures permitted by Islam, at the instigation of Christian Powers; a carefully organised conspiracy followed, and in May 1913, in an outburst of religious fanaticism, the Omani tribes arose in rebellion.| 45. Reinforcements were despatched by His Majesty’s Government in fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895, and then communicated to the Sheikhs of Oman, that they would not allow attacks to be made on Muscat or Muttrak whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes—a guarantee, the principle of which was extended in practice to the ports of the Batinah coast and to Kuryet, which contained resident British subjects. The warning in question was renewed, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government,+ but produced no impression on the Omanis, and while in January 1915 the crushing defeat of an attack in force on /the British outposts stationed at Bait-el-Falaj for the protection of Muscat and Mattrah taught the tribes their lesson, by 1916 the rebels had obtained complete control of all Oman proper, and had organised a Government in it; and they remained thereafter in undisputed possession of the interior, and a constant menace to the coast towns. These they would probably have taken had it not been for the British garrison at Bait-el-Falaj and the knowledge that the arrival of one of His Majesty’s ships would quickly have forced them to relinquish any hold which they might temporarily have established. 46. Thanks to the efforts of the Political Agent, a conference to consider terms of peace between the Sultan and the Imam of the Omani tribes took place at Sib on the 15th September 1915. It was completely abortive,§ the demands of the Sultan that the Wadi Samail and its forts (captured in August 1913, and essential to the commercial prosperity of Muscat)!' should be returned to him, and his temporal supremacy in Oman recognised, being categorically refused by the Omanis, who demanded on their part that the Sultan should reform his Government according to their ideas, that their financial claims should be settled in full, and that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed. No reconciliation proved possible, and the negotiations were broken off. 47. From the breaking off of the negotiations in September 1915, no further steps were taken towards a settlement until March 1918. The Imam consolidated his power in the interior, while the Sultan’s Government, according to the Political Agent, “ became involved in hopeless debt and reached an unparalleled degree of ineptitude.” 48. Further abortive negotiations took place in March 1918, but there was no substantial advance until the following year. At the beginning of9L9 ( see paras. 29-30) the necessity of taking drastic measures to preserve the Sultan’s Government on the coast from complete collapse was recognised by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government; a loan from Indian revenues was made to His Highness to enable him to put his house in order internally, and pressure was put on the Omani tribes through the Political Agent with a view to securing a settlement between them and the Sultan. After much correspondence, the Imam was persuaded to resume negotiations, and a meeting took place between him and the Political Agent at Sib on the 15th September 1919.* 49. Very great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreement. It was only after negotiations had been broken off, and definite action taken to show not only that the support of the Sultan by His Majesty’s Government was a reality, but that the Sultan was in a position to retaliate effectively on the Omanis by the taxing of their produce when it came down to the coast for export, that any advance was secured. A British Adviser was appointed to the State,f a British warship, which actually inflicted punish ment at Masnaah,^ was despatched to support the Sultan’s authority on the coast, and prohibitive duties were imposed on Omani produce, with the result that in July 1920 the Imam was murdered by his tribes,§ and that on 25th September 1920, after considerable further negotiation, agreement was reached between the conflicting parties.j| 50. Under the terms of settlement, the Sultan undertook^ not to interfere in the “ internal affairs ” of Oman (no formal admission of Omani indepen dence being given); not to impose taxation in excess of 5 per cent, on commodities brought into the coast towns from Oman ; to allow members of the tribes to enter and leave Muscat and the coast towns in safety and freedom ; and to return fugitive criminals on demand. 51. The tribes, on the other hand, contracted to remain in peace and amity with the Sultan’s Government, with which they were not to interfere; not to attack the coast towns ; to impose no restrictions on trade: to under take that travellers to Oman on their lawful business should be free and safe ; to turn out fugitive criminals and evil-doers; and to dispose of the claims of merchants and others against them according to the Sharah law. 52. The agreement, which, as will be seen, involves recognition by the Sultan of the practical independence of the Omani tribes, has, on the whole, worked well since 1920. Action had to be taken in 1922 by His Majesty’s ships in support of the Muscat Government against one of the Omani tribes (the Yal Saad, on the Batineh coast),** but, broadly speaking, the situation has stabilised itself, and the Omani tribes, while they would no doubt constitute an immediate menace were the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment withdrawn, have ceased, at any rate temporarily, to interfere with and harass the Sultan’s Government. V.—Foreign Relations of Muscat, 1908-1928. 53. During the first part of the period now under consideration, the existence of treaty relations between France and Muscat was, as will be seen from paras. 7-lb above, of the first importance from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the relations between the two countries, since the substantial consideration which led to French interest in Muscat disappeared with the amicable settlement reached between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government on the suppression of the arms traffic in February 1914. But the settlement in question did not involve the abrogation of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844, or of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18b2, and the continued existence of these instruments is of sufficient importance in present circumstances to call for brief notice in this Memorandum. 54. As will be seen from the precis of the Muscat Treaties referred to in para. 2 above, the Sultan of Muscat has a Commercial Treaty with France dating from 1844. There is further the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 3064 C * P. 37!»0/l'J : tel. 1464 S. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Oct. 22 1919, P. 6724/19, 7369/19. t Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Jan. 16 1920, P.8544/19, 5039/20.

Letter 109 S. to G. of I., Mar 2 1928, P. 1592/28. 1862, the signatories to which agree reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan. While the agreement concluded by the Sultan with Her Majesty’s Government in 1891, under which he pledged himself and his successors never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to Her Majesty’s Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies, represents a substantial departure from the spirit of the Declaration of 1862, that Declaration remained and remains binding, and an assurance that His Majesty’s Government recognised it as such was formally given to France in September 1913.' ,: ' Its existence, taken with the existence of the Treaty of 1844, was responsible for the difficulty which arose with France in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic between 1910 and 1914, and it is not only clear that it precludes the establishment by His Majesty’s Government of a formal protectorate over Muscat, but in view of the action taken under its terms vis-d-vis France at Bander Gisseh. in 1899, it seems probable that it constitutes a definite impediment even to the acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of the lease, e.g. for use as a naval base, of any portion of Muscat territory. This latter difficulty is of importance at the present time in view of the revival by the Political Resident of the proposal for the establishment of a British naval base at Khassab in the Musandim Peninsula (see paras. 65 to 71 below). 55. It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the efforts made between 1910 and 1914, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, to secure French concurrence in the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 and possibly of the Treaty of 1844. Suffice it to say that it proved impracticable to arrive at an agreement which could be confined to Muscat, or even to Muscat and the French possessions in Indiaf; that France was not prepared to cede her rights in return for territorial acquisitions in India- alone-J; that the Government of India were reluctant to agree to any cession of Indian territory, save in return for a corresponding acquisition of French territory in India (Chandernagore and the Loges); and that proposals of compensation in other parts of the world by the cession of Gambia, the rectification of the Desert Boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and hrench Equatorial Africa, or by the grant to the French Government of certain concessions in North Africa, came to nothing. 7 o 56. The position, therefore, is that French rights persist in their entirety. On the other hand, for the last 14 years no matter of dispute between the French Government and His Majesty’s Government has arisen in Muscat; the Muscat dhows flying the French flag had fallen by 1920 to seven, of which two only belonged to French subjects^ ; and French interests in the affairs of the Sultanate has shown a progressive decrease, although a Consulate is still maintained by France. In 1920-1 the French Government relinquished the coal depot at Mokalla,!| which had been granted them at the time of the Bander Gisseh incident of 1899 dealt with in Mr. Parkers memorandum, and in 1928 the Political Resident^ stated that he gathered from the French Consul (at Bushire?) that “France now takes very little interest in Muscat and is now considering closing down permanently the Consulate, which has not been held by any incumbent for some years.” 57. While, however, France may no longer actively concern herself with Muscat affairs, so long as the engagements referred to in para. 54 remain in being His Majesty’s Government cannot be regarded as free agents in lespect of Muscat, even though practical control may rest with them and all external expenditure on the State be financed by them. On a broad view the interests of His Majesty’s Government would probably best be served by the abrogation of both instruments, and it is possible that, at some later stage, if French interest in Muscat diminishes to vanishing point, the French Government might be willing to consider the extinction of their rights as part of an arrangement which would also dispose of the Ion ^standing question of the French Loges in India itself, without demanding an unreasonable quid pro quo. But it cannot be overlooked that the 1862 Declaration, inconvenient as it may be in certain ways to His Majesty’s Government, is of value as constituting a certain check on designs on Muscat by other Powers. From a different standpoint, its existence, taken with that■■■Hi mmmmp ■■■■ 13 of the Treaty of 1811, is an assurance to the Sultan, the value of which was certainly fully appreciated by his predecessor, that he will not suffer the fate of Zanzibar. 58. The United States of America, despite their Treaty of 1833 with ^Muscat, appear in practice to ha've no relations of any importance with that State, their interests in which are now entrusted to His Majesty’s Government. 0 No question affecting these relations arose during the period now under consideration. Here, however, as in the case of France, the guarantees embodied in the Treaty of 1833 would make it impossible for the Sultan to increase his customs duty (the most important method of raising revenue at his disposal) without the prior concurrence of the United States Government (cp, para. 37 above). 59. No question affecting the relations between the Sultan and the Dutch Government arose during the period in question, and those relations appear, as in the case of the United States Government, to be entirely unimportant. Under the Commercial Declaration of 1877 Holland is, however, entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, and so would be affected by any modification of the customs duties. GO. The possibility of the development of a German interest in Muscat was of interest to His Majesty’s Government in the years before the war. The present Sultan was informed in 1913 that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to direct correspondence between him and the German Consul, a practice contrary to the practice of Sultan Faisal, who had referred to His Majesty’s Government matters affecting Powers unrepresented at Muscat.']* The danger of the acquisition by Germany of a foothold in Muscat through the grant to Muscatis of German certificates of nationality, was prominently before His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in 1914-. To prevent the establishment of a precedent which could be quoted by Germany, arrangements were made that the British flag should not be granted to Muscat subjects in British East Africa unless a “no objection ” certificate had first been secured from the Sultan through the Political Agent,J and the question of securing the Sultan’s approval to an edict which would have made his personal consent a condition of the transfer of allegiance by an Omani to a foreign State was under consideration at the outbreak of the war.§ The difficulty which would be presented by a German request to the signatories of the Joint Declaration of 18G2 for their concurrence in the conclusion of a direct German Commercial Treaty with Muscat (on the basis of which a political connection could be developed), were brought to the attention of Government bv the Political Resident in July 1914.' Relations between Muscat and Persia. 61. No question of importance as between Persia and Muscat has arisen during the period now in question. It may be recorded that in the autumn of 1914, on the request of the Persian Government, the Political Agent was instructed to exercise his good offices on behalf of Persian subjects in Muscat should an appeal be made to him, and in all serious cases of hardship and oppression.^ The report recently received from Sir Lionel Haworth that instructions had been issued by the Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire that Persia can recognise no rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that persons belonging to and arriving from Muscat (as from the other principalities on the Arab littoral) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports issued to them, necessitates, however, a brief reference to the possible basis of a Persian claim to suzerainty over Muscat. So far as can be traced, the only two incidents in the past on which any such claim could be based are the fact that for a few months in 1623 Persia occupied Sohar and Khor Fakkan and that from 1737 until her expulsion in 1744 she was in occupation of Muscat. It is impossible as yet to estimate the importance which should be attached to the report referred to above, of which no confirmation is available from other sources. Any Persian claim of the * Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I Oct. 29 1920, P. 7936/20. f Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I Dec. 31 1913, P. 1/14; F.O. to I.O., Jan. 9 1914, P. 139.

Relations between Muscat and Ibn Saud. 02. Ibn Saud is a growing influence on the Trucial Coast, but he has not so far come very directly in contact ^with Muscat, to the independence of which he constitutes at the moment a less immediate menace than is the case on the Trucial Coast. VI.—Miscellaneous Questions. (a) The Muscat Order in Council. (b) Establishment of a British Naval Base on the Musandim Peninsula. (c) Cession of Gwadur. (d) Oil in Muscat. (a) The Muscat Order in Council—1867 and 1915. 63. From 1807 the jurisdiction exercised over British subjects in Muscai by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul was exercised under the Muscat Order in Council of 1807. :i: ' The revision of this Order, which had become out, of date, was raised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1913. His proposals that the revision should be undertaken were accepted by the Government of Indiat and His Majesty’s Government, 6 and a revised Order in Council in substitution for the Order of 1867 was approved by His Majesty on the 3rd February 1915. The new Order, which came into force on the 1st January 1910,J vests in the Political Agent, 2 subject to the general control of, and right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, jurisdiction over— (а) British subjects, and British ships, with their boats, and persons and property on board, or belonging to them, within the limits of the Order. (б) Muscat subjects registered in the Political Agency as in the regular service of British subjects, subject to a proviso as to the disposal of cases in which such Muscat subjects are concerned. ‘ (c) The property, &amp;c., of all British subjects and of the Muscat subjects referred to in (?;), whether within or without the limits of the Order. (d) Foreigners, with respect to whom any State, &amp;c., the subjects, or under the protection, of which they are has agreed by treaty to the exercise of power or authority by His Majesty. (e) Muscat subjects and foreigners, other than those referred to in (b) and (d) in certain specified cases. The limits of the Order are the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 64. Various regulations, &amp;c., have since 1910 been issued under the new Order, certain amendments in which were approved by His Majesty in §r. 931/22. Council in 1922,§ but no question of importance has arisen in connection with its working. (b) Proposal for the establishment of a British Naval Base in the Musandim Peninsula. 05. The earlier history of this proposal, which appears first to have been made by Sir Lewis Pelly, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in 1803, is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and in Lorimer’s Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Vol. I, pp. 251 to 258. 00. The question was again raised in 1913. In a Note communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 17th January 1913, the Admiralty expressed the view that it was “ essential that any naval station that may be * Cp. letter 205 from Pol. Res. to G of I., Jan. 19 1913, P. 4187/13. t G. of 1. Secret Deep. 108. Gen., to S. of S for 1.. Oct. 1 1913. P. 1487/13. J G. of 1.

There would otherwise be risk of our being driven by military force from our necessary naval base. Moreover, the only anchorages which can be trusted are on the Arabian shore.” w 07. Almost simultaneously the Political Resident had suggested that it might be desirable to choose Ras Musandim as a site for a lighthouse in preference to Little Quoin,and the Government of India, in the light of the expression of the views of the Admiralty quoted above, were prepared to ^ agree to the substitution “ apart from the considerations arising from the Anglo-French Declaration of lS62.”t OS. In April 1913 the Government of India reported that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, saw technical objections to the selection of Musandim as the site for a lighthouse on the grounds that “ thick weather over Musandim is the rule rather than the exception . . . further . . . worst tides experienced anywhere in the Gulf and its approaches are found round Musandim Island.”+ 69. In May the Admiralty expressed the view that “ while a naval base on the Musandim Peninsula would theoretically be in a somewhat better strategical position for the control of a railway passing along the northern shore of the entrance to the Gulf, if threatened by a hostile advance from the north-west, practical considerations point rather for the present to the use of Henjam . . . with Basidu as a subsidiary base. It does not appear necessary to contemplate the actual fortification of a naval base in this region so long as we retain the command of the sea in Eastern waters.”§ This disposed of the question of a station on Musandim; and it was agreed that the lighthouse in contemplation should be erected on Little Quoin as being preferable from the strictly navigational standpoint. 70. There appear to have been no developments until in February 1927 the Political Residentj] indicated that Khassab was of value, not merely in connection with the air route, on which it would constitute a jumping off ground for Gwadur on the Makran coast, but for strategical reasons, since “the country possessing it can practically command egress from and ingress to the Persian Gulf.” Sir L. Haworth therefore favoured the purchase of Khassab from Muscat, possibly for about £12,000, and the establishment of “a Gibraltar at the head of the Gulf.” He regarded this as practicable vis-d-vis France, in view of the right of pre-emption enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government under the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. 71. Xo views have been expressed on the subject by the Government of India. With the Persian challenge to the position of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Basidu and Henjam the possibility of establishing, if not a fortified base, at any rate a station, in the Musandim Peninsula or on one of the adjoining islands, on two of which (Telegraph Island and Sheep Island) the British flag has for a short period been hoisted in the past, becomes of more * immediate importance. But, financial and strategical considerations apart, the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are free agents vis-d-vis France, who, though aware of, is not a party to, and has never formally recognised, the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, will call for careful examina tion before a decision can be taken. (c) The Cession of Gwadur. 72. It was decided in 1863 after exhaustive examination that no attention need or could be paid to the claims to Gwadur, a dependency of Muscat in Makran, on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, of the Khan of Kalat or of the Gitchkis. This decision was reaffirmed by the Government of India in 1928.^ 73. The question of its retransfer to Kalat at a price was raised by the Political Agent, Muscat, in 1921, when the financial situation of Muscat was critical, but the Government of India were instructed’ 1 ' 0 that no overtures should be made to the Sultan of Muscat without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government, and the matter dropped. fisty * Tel. from Pol.

The geographical position of Gwadur would lend it consideialih importance in the event of an air route being established along the north Arabian coast, and the Political Resident mb ehruary 192, proposed that it should be purchased outright for, say, £ 13 o , 000 , or a bo u - jeaia purchase of the present customs revenue (Rs. 11 b ,000 in sa .Y a v 1 after deduction of expenses of collection) as a British possession, ic Khan of Kalat being compensated for his claim out of the amount in question. No opinion on the matter has been expressed by the Government of India. But, as in the case of Khassab and the Musandmi 1 romontoiv (para. 71 above), the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are free agents vis a-vis France would need very careful examination betoie a decision could be taken even were the proposal held to be fiee from objection on other grounds. •f Pol.

The Sultan undertook in February 1923 not to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories, or to grant permission for its exploitation, without prior consultation with the Political Agent, and the appio\al of the Government of India. An oil concession was secured from His Highness, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, by the Anglo-1 oisian Oil Company in 1925. (Hie general question of oil m tue Gulf is dealt uith m the Memorandum by the Board of 1 rade on p. fUJ. ! VII.—Summary. 76. The last 20 years have seen the practical elimination of French influence in Muscat and the consolidation of the influence of His Majesty s Government. Despite the fact that the Sultanate is independent, a '^013 close degree of indirect control has been established ; the succession has been regulated ; the customs administration has been brought uudei the management of officials recommended by the Government of India, a European adviser, a servant indeed of the Sultan, but recommended and selected by the Government of India, and working in close and fi lendly co-operation with the Political Agent, is the mainspring of the adminis tration; the arms traffic has disappeared, and, thanks to the active intervention, both political and otherwise, of His Majesty’s Government, a working arrangement has been reached with the rebellious tribes of the interior of Oman. The main difficulties which at the moment confront the State are the instability of the Sultan’s character, and the possibility that before a suitable successor is available he may renew his desire to abdicate; the financial situation, which is complicated by the need for expenditure on essential improvements, the fact that the main source of additional revenue—increase of customs duties—cannot without, great difficulty be tapped, and the necessity of repayment to the Government of India of the balance of the loan made to the State in 1919 : and the problem, the importance of which cannot at this stage be appraised, but which may not prove to be serious, of the attitude of the tribes of Sur. 77 . The direct intervention in the affairs of Muscat of His Majesty’s Government has been very definitely in the interests of the State, and, so far as those interests are concerned, it is desirable that it should be maintained. At the same time, so long as the treaties at present in force between the Sultan and the Governments of France, Holland and the United States continue to subsist, there can be no question of the establishment of a formal protectorate, even should wider objections of principle not be held to militate against the acceptance of such a policy. From the narrower point of view of the interests of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, there is no less advantage in a maintenance of the status quo, under which control in everything but name rests with His Majesty’s Government. With the gradual elimination of British authority from the south Persian coast and with the adoption, for however long it may be maintained, of an active policy in the Gulf by Persia, the strangle hold on the Gulf which the effective control of Muscat constitutes has assumed an importance, more especially in view oi British commitments in Iraq, which it did not in the past present. Moreover, not only is effective, if veiled,17 control o£ Muscat the po(7’appiii of the consolidation of British influence on the north Arabian littoral, but the danger, in its absence, of active foreign interest in the State cannot be overlooked, while should it ultimately prove that the difficulties in the way of an Imperial air route through Persian ^territory are insuperable, Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, may prove to ^ be of great importance for air reasons. From the naval point of view, should a decision favourable to the establishment of a naval base in the Musandim Peninsula at any stage be taken, and should it prove possible to reconcile the acquisition of a site for such a base with the terms of the Anglo-French v Declaration of 1802, the principality would acquire an additional importance. 78. To sum up. The predominant influence in Muscat of His Majesty’s Government is in the interest of the State itself. The commitments involved in its maintenance are not, in existing circumstances, heavy, though the presence of a British Adviser and the exclusion of foreign interference imposes on His Majesty’s Government a measure of responsibility for the progress, or lack of progress, of the State. The predominant influence of His Majesty’s Government is equally, and more especially in present circumstances, an Imperial interest, whether from the commercial or the strategical standpoint. It can be maintained without undue “Westernisation,” and, while it can never be popular with the fanatical tribes of the interior, its withdrawal is unlikely to be desired so long as the country internally remains divided as it has been for many years, and so long as no ruler arises with a personality so outstanding as to show himself capable of disposing effectively, single- handed, of the problems presented by the government of his State. VIII. —Points referred to in connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 79. The points in connection with Muscat which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Committee are as follow :— (1) Is the maintenance of the independence of Muscat (which is also threatened, though less immediately, by Ibn Saud) necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 (viii).) (2) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery and the arms traffic. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 3.) (3) Extent to which British influence is to be maintained in Muscat: question of relations between the Sultan and the Amirs of Jaalan (Sur): position vis-d-vis the French. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 5.) IX.—Views expressed by Government of India. SO. The Government of India have expressed the view that “ the maintenance of independence of Muscat, Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Chief is necessary. Our veiled protectorate over them suffices against European encroachments. So long as we do not alienate Arab opinion by attempting undue Westernisation, it suffices also against encroachments by the Wahabi State. At need it can be more explicitly asserted.” India Office, 25th August 1928. )5t) Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., July 23 1928, P. 3880, P.G. 9. J. G.

To :he Port Director and Director-General of Navigation, Basrah. 3ubj ec t: ject:- Survey report of the Southern entrance to the Khor Kaliya (Bahrein). Submitted. - The M 1TDAHG|^'13 ,, arrived at Bahrein at 1720 on the 29.11. and enchored in the Inner Harbour pending favourable weather to commence the Survey. The Bench mark at Hannas Village was located and found to be in a dilapidated condition the pipe having apparently been broken off short. Prom subsequent observations it was found that there was a difference of 4.72 feet m the levex the top of the pipe to the level given on Admiralty Chart Ho.3380. Tiiis mark was therefore ignored and a tide gauge was erectec at Kassar Diwan Rock which is shown as 1 foot high on the above Chart, and a series of observations made from whiciu the mean tide level was obtained, this agreed with the value of mean tide level shown on the Admiralty Chart to within .09 oi a a. oot; all soundings were subsequently reduced to this dauum. On 1.12.1926 the 'ITDARCHUS' proceeded to the entrance to the Khor Kaliya and anchored. After soundings had oeen taken and buoys laid the 'Nearchus' proceeded across the Bar and enchored at the Southern end of the Khor Kaliya. The survey of the entrance was commenced on the 2.12.1928 the base line being measured from Khor Kaliya Beacon as being were set up and soundings taken with aid of tne snips Eio^oi The prevailing weather conditions did not permit of borings being taken but the area was thoroughly examined with a pricker and the nature of the bottom ascertained to consist of the most suitable position available. After the tnangulation had been completed transit marks as shown on the Pair Sheet boat. layer of loose c oral and sand about 2 to 3 inches in depth covering acovering an aqueous roclc forma‘tion samples o± v, r liioh. were obtained. This appears to be an extension of the Kassar Div;an reef and not of silt formation. fhe set and drift of the tide was observed and the results are shown on the IPair Sheet. Comparing the observations made with my experience of the dredging operations at the Shatt-al-Arab Outer Bar, I am Oj. the considered opinion that the Brag ouction type of Diedger could not be employed with any measure of success. Blasting and grab dredging would appear to be the only means by which the desired depth could oe obtained a^ hie entrance to the Khor. The whole period during which the survey was carried out was interrupted by bad weather and further work was abandoned on the 14.12.1928 when the 'USARCHU3' sailed for Basrah there being no prospects of the weather moderating.

The best anchorage is undoubtedly that shown on Chart 5540, to tile Bastward of the middle ground, *llEARCHU3 tt rode out a strong shamal in this anchorage. It is equally well sheltered from the KAU3 T .7ind. W 1IBARCKU3 M was previously anchored about 5 cables HITS from Khor Kaliya Beacon and good shelter was obtained from the haus. A sudden shift of the wind to the 3SW caused the ship to drag and I shifted berth to the anchorage previously mentioned. The entrance to Khor Kaliya in my opinion should only be attempted before H.W. as a strong cross current rendered a low powered ship practically unmanageable. I have , etc. , 3d.

Referrring to your instructions, I have closely exaLiineci the plans prepared by the Survey Party and the specimens of rock obtained from the bar across the Khor Kaliyah and submit the following The removal of the shoal does not appear to present any serious difficulty but due to set of currents, open site, nature of bottom, etc. it is suggested that the channel be laid true 1TK7* and S.E. and be 300 ft. wide with 22 ft. of water oelu.,- datum to allow of vessels drawing 19 ft. to enter and leave at any state of the tide. Prom the sample of rock produced it would appear that the bottom is composed with the exception of a thin layer in places of sand and loose coral, of coral rock. The samples have no appearance of aqueous rock or sandstone. The net quantity of material to be removed is 36,000 cubic yards and allowing 25^ for an uneven depth the amount to oe dredged can be taken in round figure as 45,000 cubic yards. With a rock Gutter (Lobnitz) the material could be broken up more evenly and less material would be removed than explosives but the cost of obtaining suitable plant might be prohibitive. After the rock had been broken it would have to be picked up by a grab dredger and dumped. A hopper grab dredger appears to be the most suitable type of craft. fhe cost of the work entirely depends on the plant available and cost of geeting it to the site as the joo is nou big enough to warrant new craft being constructed. Provided suitable plant can be hired either in Karachi, Bombay or one of the near Indian Ports it is considered that the cost would be about Rs.6 per cubic yard or in all Rs.270,000. (Thisno data is available for (This figure must he checked as closely estimating the work). There would he no difficulty in erecting leading beacons in the neighbourhood of Khor Kaliyah Beacon and these are recommended as well as two port hand ouoys at the entrance and exit of the cut hut these would have to be heavily moored to prevent dragging* The Basrah Port Directorate do not possess suitable craft for the work. The only vessel suitable is the 3.7.
