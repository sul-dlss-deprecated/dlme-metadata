Half the anount levied may be taken by the clerk in cash! and half will be credited to the fund. From this fund disbursements of the amount available will be made every half year to those clerks on whom co )ying falls. The total amount should not be disbursed however, the idea being to ultimately have in hand a balance of about a yea^s receipts. This would be attained by keeping back about ten per cent each year. The above order applies equally to all copying work done in the Agency. Clerks who have been absent during the half year would only be entitled to share in the fund according to the length of time they have been available for this duty. It is not intended that clerks should receive money from this fund whether they do copying or not, but that only those whose duties require them to do copying should do so.OFF IP'S OHIBR NQ.1Q, Bhaghwan Singh Mis try, Bahrein Radio, will get an allowance of R b#10/- p»m. vdth effect from the 1st June 1929 for looking after electric bells, telephone etc# Bahrein# Bated 13th Lx^xst 1929 01 Political Agent, Bahrein# 4^.

Since this arrangement is in many cases unfair to permanent and senior men in the Lower Division it is proposed, as an experimental measure, to fill these Upper Division vacancies, wherever possible, by appointments from our permanent staff. The clerks so appointed will not necessarily travel to the place to take up their offi ciating appointments but will continue to work where they are. For example, Mr.'X' who may be working in Bahrain, may be appointed to an officiating Upper Division post in Bushire. Mr.'X' will continue to work in Bahrain and his pay will be drawn by the Bahrain Agency and debited to Bushire estimates. Similarly, Mr. 'Y' who may be appointed vice Mr. 'X' in Bahrain will stay in Bushire and his pay will be drawn in Bushire and debited to Bahrain estimates. As Customs Compensatory Allowance is attached to posts in Iran those working on the Arab Coast will not draw this allowance. Similarly, wherever free quarters are given no house rent will be drawn. m- f. /2.2. 2. An Office Order showing officiating appointments is forwarded herewith.

British Consulate General Bushire• 31st August 1942. I have been trying to ascertain why the Bahrain office goes in for issuing office orders of its own. (None of the other sub-offices do.) It seems that the reason was to inform the Residency of the actual dates when clerks handed over or took over, so as to form the basis of the Residency office order, (which is, of course, the only official one for the purpose of pay bills, service book entries and so forth). 2. It seems to me that it would be much better if this were done by ordinary memorandum, as the other sub-offices do; as the issue of two sets of office orders leads to confusion, and one never knows whether your office order is an extract from ours, or a proposal for an entry in ours. 3. So I should be glad if Bahrain also would handle these matters by letter (or telegram where desirable) in future.

I was in the office till 4,0 f clock, and was then just on the act of soing out, when Mr. Ramanathan came to the office and in answer to my query as to what brought him there told me that he had some Express letters etc. to be typed for despatch etc. He went to the E.G. and then I went to my room, as there was a letter from Gray,Mac kenzie to the address of P.A. which I wanted to place on the Head Clerk ! s table. When I went to the E.O. to place this letter on H.^s table, Mr. R. asked me to read to him a certain word from one of the drafts. While we were thus engaged, Dr.Siddiq came there and after some friendly chat asked Mr. Ramanatham to give him a certain file (old volume) saying that the file which was sent to him in the morning did not contain what he wanted. He did not give any details of what paper he wanted. Ramanathan told him that all the volumes of the file were in a certain cupboard and showed the Dr. the cupboard The Dr. went there, took out one of the volumes and after going through the pages, said Irhat he could not find what he wanted there, and asked for another volume. Mr. Ramanathan took a certain volume from the rack behind him (saying that that was the current volume) and gave it to the Dr. After some time, the Dr. said that he could not find what he wanted in that volume either, and said he wanted yet another volume (l think he mentioned Vol.VII^ Mr.Ramanathan said that he did not know where that volume was, and that he was not fully conversant with all the files and that he would have to ask Mr. Braganza about it. The Doctor then asked me whether Mt.Braganza was in the office and I said 'No.' In the meantime Mr.Ramanathan inserted paper in his typewriter and began to type., and D-r.Siddiq was again going through the file. After a few [ minutes, the Doctor said to Ramanathan that the next mor- I■ - &amp;-2~ ning he wanted the old volumes to le put up to him. Mr.Ramanathan who was all this time typing got up from his machine and came to his writing table and told the Dr. that he was very busy with some urgent worfe- and would see the files next morning. To this the Dr. asked 'Did you hear what I said? You have been most inattentive. When I asked for the file you shov/ed me the rack without find^the file yourself, and then you say that you aid dbo not know anything about the files? Do you expect me to know about them?' or words to this effect. Mr.Ramana- than answered with saying that he was not the record keeper arui that he did not know anything and that the Dr. had no business to ask him directly for the files and especially after office hours, and that he should approach the Head Clerk if he wanted anything. The Dr. ^ot very much heated at this and went to Mr.Ai.1az Ali ! s table saying that he would complain about the rude behaviour of Mr.Hamanathan, and passing remarks once again about the careless and irresponsible of his A answering him, Mr. Ramathan then told him in a tone of finality that he should be approached only through the H.C. and that the Dr. had better mind his business ins tead of passing reflections on him. After that Mr.Rama- nathan went on with his typing, and after sometime (it was somewhere near 5) we left the office. I did not think it advisable to butt in and I did not make any remark throughout - during the course of this altercation. kj-r V') v '-Yesterday I camCto office at about 3- 30. P .I'-, to type some express letters to Bushire. fhen I was about to start typing Dr. Siddiq came to the office and commenced talking some private matters with me and T'.Tr. liajagopal. Incidentally he asked about N.O .C. Files anJ I told him that I sent a file in the morning and as he vaguely asked about fie IT.O.C. files I asked him which particular he wanted as there are several I-.O.C files, and what reference he .;a; ted to .ake. I told him that some old N.C .C. files are lying in the shelf and I am not aware o ' the old files. I showed some current files and even leaving my typing work for which I came specially, 1 searched some files in the cupboard and being unable to find files I told him that I will ask Mr. Braganza about the old files. - ean.;hile he was referring to the ;£xiK current .:'ile that I gave him and I started typing. He was uttering something which 1 could not hear properly and I told him that I will see the old files today morning ( 16-7-37). Suddenly he interrogated me in a provoking and threatening manner Tl V/hat do you say? ' and some thing like this and to avoid any unpleasantness with him I told him to put in writing whatever file he wants through the proper channel. I know Dr. Siddiq very well when I was in Bushire, and being a .'are kx of his temper 1 told him like this to avoid any unpleasantness with him. Dr. Siddiq himself knov^that I am new to this office and I am not in touch with the old files nor Braganza has showed me the old files as I presume the old files are in charge of the record keeper. TSven yesterda ' morning he addressed Record keeper for the old files and even leaving aside my urgent sd? work of decoding telegram I sent an old file that I found in the % shelf for which Dr. Siddiq himself told in the evening that he wanted some other old 'ile. Without giving any letter ' r o. or date of his reference, I could not locate which old file he wanted. His remarks an the p nultimate para of his note is uncalled for and he has no occasion to see my work at BushireI { ■ r lulpl as he was only a munshi in the vernacular office. Dr * 3idciic l may be having his o\m prejudices against me especially after this incident and this being reflected in his notings, I leave to your discretion to view the things in the proper light . Even after this talk When he was writing something at the spot he was saying something about me though i did not reply to him as I was busy in typing. It is really un fortunate that I had to face the humiliating remarks of Dr. Siddiq in an^fficial hour and rather in an unofficial way. \ Yesterday I came to office to clear up my arrears and i was confronted dth this unhappy episode, . Ki • r ;-^5 Mr.Rajagopalan was the eye witness to the incident and his statement is attached for perusal pi. It appears from Hajagopalan 1 s statement that Dr. Siddiq wanted the H.O.C.files at 4-35,p.m. from Mr.Ramanathai who happened to be in the office to clear up his arrears of * typing etc., He was not on duty on that date, and even if any clerk would have been on d^rty hp was supposed to attend to the urgent telggraras(vide office orders) and was not supposed to search for the old records which the I,A.deinande&lt; at 4-30 p.m. If Dr.Siddiq wanted the files he could have done this next morning or during office hours between 8 to 1 p.m. Further as Mr.Ramanathan was not on duty on that day he was neither bound to carry out Dr.Siddiq 1 s wishes nor was it flair for Dr.Siddiq to ask for the files at 4-45, p.m.from Mr.Ramanathan who does not act as a record keeper. The old volumes of files are kept under lock in the record room and the record keeper only has an access to them. Mr.Ramanathan is new to this office.He is here only for the last nine days and if he failed to produce the proper file required by the I.A. at 4-30 p.m. the I.A. could have taken the next morning. As English Office is directly under the control of A.P.A. and not under the control of I.A. it would have been fair for the I.A. if he would have demanded the files throug the proper channel i.e. through A.F.A. or from the Head Clerk, in case of absence of the former. Dr.Siddiq 1 s underlined wordings(vide Rajagopalan 1 s statement) to an English Office Clerk who -was neither on duty nor was under I.A.'s direct control, appear to be rather vindictive and dominating in so far as it does not fall within the cognizance of the I.A. to tpeat an English Office clerk in the manner specified therein especially when the clerk was not under his direct control In brief if Dr.Sidiq wanted the old volumes of files he could have written an urgent slip to the^ Head Clerknext morning and his request could have been complied with instantaneously instead of coming into an embroil with the clerk who is new to the office at present. n-i *1 0 Issued an Office Order dated 17th July 1937 Issued D.O. dated 17th July 1937 to Dp-Siddiq. y. o- No-, iSlb lA-' (L. , f'- t.'-- , , Vt- 5V / - 3 '3Office TT ote e T am expecting that T Tr.
