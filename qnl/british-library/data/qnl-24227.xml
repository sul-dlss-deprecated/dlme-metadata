Receipts in connexion with public information services.I (XF 022 (9/48) ) CIHGULAR No. 060 Foreign Office, 30th April, 1948. Estimates and Expenditure Difficulties and delay have been occasioned by reason of a widespread failure to observe the directions in my circular No. 094 of 18th July, 1946. Moreover, many returns received have contained information in a misleading form. '2. Estimates, at the time of presentation to Parliament, should approximate as closely as possible to the ultimate actual expenditure and receipts based on authorisations and expectations existing at that time. Any wide discrepancies may involve the Foreign Office in embarrassing explanations and adverse criticism. In order to attain the required degree of accuracy it is essential that local returns of actual expenditure should be accurate. I 3. The annual estimates have to be furnished by the Foreign I Office to the Treasury not later than the 1st December, each year. I Unless, therefore, all returns from overseas Missions reach the Foreign Office during October and early November, they are useless. It should be possible for most Missions to send their returns during October. Only in exceptional circumstances should it be necessary to delay despatch until November. '4. Financial returns and quarterly accounts cannot be rendered when due unless the local accounts are kept up to date. Regard for the adequate safeguarding of public funds demands that accounts should be kept up to date. Any considerable arrears of accounts work suggests unsatisfactory methods and calls for early investigation. 5. In framing the local return of financial transactions during the period 1st April to 30th September, it is important • to note any considerable item of either expenditure or revenue ■'which is of a non-recurring nature (e.g., car purchases, cessation of a section of work or a post). Particulars should also be fur nished of nonrecurring and additional items of expenditure, or receipts, which are likely to arise during (i) the remaining six months of the current financial year and (ii) the whole of the following financial year (i.e., from ist April to 31st March). 6. In these circumstances, and in view of a rearrangement of subheads in the 1948—49 Vote, the form of return has been revised. A supply of the new form is attached. I 7. Amounts shown against salaries, wages, allowances, &amp;c., should be supported by a detailed statement shoving a complete list of staff (both United Kingdom based and local) employed at your post on 1st October, whose emoluments are a charge on t le Diplomatic and Consular Establishments, &amp;c., Vote, as directed in paragraph 6 of circular 094. 8. For the purpose of accounting on and from 1st April, 1948, attention is directed to the amalgamation of certain expenditure under n-w general subheads, as follows:-1948-49 Subhead Service Incorporating previous Subheads v- p Journeys on the Public Service (excluding P.I.S.) A2. Diplomatic C3. Commercial Diplomatic Part D3. Consular G Outfits (excluding P.I.S.) Part A7. Diplomatic Part Cl. Commercial Diplomatic D4. Consular H • Official Car Service... Part A7.

Consular Other subhead changes will be observed in the accompanying specimen forms. 9. Additional copies of this circular, together with_the appropriate forms, are enclosed for distribution to Superintending Consular Officers within the Metropolitan territory of the country in whiph you reside, who should be instructed to complete the forms in due*course and return them to the Finance Department, Foreign Office. A similar circular is being addressed to consular posts outside your metropolitan territory and to those posts which have no superintending mission. 10. Separate returns, for which additional copies of the circular and forms are also enclosed, should be completed by Commercial Diplomatic and Public Information Officers at your post. The latter should obtain, and forward to the Foreign Office, a return from each Public Information Services post in the provinces.
