The biographical notices in the present volume were writ 1897, but, in order to bring them up to date, some notes to them on January 23rd, 1898. The register of names contains the names of living in consulting it, search for the name, surname or title by is known, and neglect all titles such as Aka, Hajji, Khai Mulla, Sayyid and Shaikh. For instance—Hajj' ' Tabrizi, will be found under A, the person's name beinJ Hajji Shaikh Muhsin Khan, Mushir ed Dowleh, will b the title by which he is known being Muskir ed Dowleh. Titles are conferred by the Shah, and generally composed of two words; the first in the nominative, as Mushir, 'Counsellor,' and the second in the genitive, as ed dowleh, ' of the State' or ' of the Empire. Not so long ago, persons possessing a title in Persia numbered about two hundred, now they number several thousands, and tides which were formerly conferred only upon princes, ministers of state, and distinguished persons, have, during the past few years, been bestowed indiscriminately, with the consequence that at present many high-sounding titles are held by persons who are neither of note nor of noble family.

AEAB TEIBE OF FAES— The Arab tribe is one of the five tribes composing the Khamseh tribe. Came originally from Najd, Omman and Yamamah in the seventh century. Some reside winter and summer near Earn Hormuz and on the banks of the Jerrahi Eiver; others are in Ears, during winter in the Buluk i Sabah, Eudan and Ahmadi districts, during summer in Bonat, Kunkuri, etc. The members of the tribe speak Persian and Turkish. This tribe is subdivided into two principal branches or sub-tribes, Jabbarah and Shaibani, the Jabbarah having twenty-eight branches, and the Shaibani twenty- three.The Jabbdrah Arabs are also known as Arab Kiichi. Prom ancient times until 1881 the chiefs of the Arabs were of the Shaibani branch, and frequently the Basari tribe was also under them. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the chief was Mir Ismail Khan Shaibdni; he was succeeded by his son Mir Mehdi Khan, who served Nadir Shah and was also chief of the Basaris. Under Kerim Khan Zend, Mir Salim Khan, son of Mir Mehdi Khan, succeeded his father as chief of the Arabs, while his brother, Mir Shafi Khan, became chief of the Basaris. Salim was succeeded by his son Aka Khan, who died 1815, and left two sons: one Abbas Khan, chief of the Arabs until 1837, when he died; the other Eeza Kuli Khan, who was Sartip of the Baharlu and Arab infantry regiment until its disbandment in ] 863, and became chief of Arabs in 1868, and died in 1881, at which time the chieftainship of the Arabs was given to Kavvam el Mulk, of Shiraz. Erom 1837 until 1868 Ali Kuli Khan, son of Abbas Khan, was chief; he was killed in the latter year, near Darab, by some of his own people whom he was pursuing in order to recover some horses which they had stolen from Darab Khan Kashkai. He left no issue. Two of Eeza Kuli Khan Sartip's sons— Aka Khan, 42 years of age, and Mir Salim Khan, 41 years of age—now reside in Kunkuri and receive a pension from the Government. The Arabs have some irregular cavalry which is commanded by Fath el Mulk, Muhammad Hassan Khan, Sartip. The branches of the Arabs are as follows:— I. Jabbdrah A1 i Sadi, Abu'l Ghani, Pirsalami, Bahluli, Jabari, Urbuz, Abu'l Muhammadi, Tati, Abu'l Husaini, Tarbar, Abu'l Sharaf, Chahar Bunichah (sub-divided into Burbur, Bozsurkhi, Jilodari, Lur), Jahaki, Hannai, Sadat i Husaini, Shahisavan, Shaba ni, Shiri, Darazi, Safari, Azzizi, Issai', Kara'i, Karaghani, Kanbari, Lavardan, Mazidi, Nakdali.

BAHIELU TEIBE OF FAES— The Baharlu tribe is one of the five tribes composing the Khamseh tribe. Was originally brought to Persia by the Seljuks andMonghols in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (a tribe of Turkomans called Baharlu still exists near Khiva). The tribe camps near Darab in summer and winter. Nadir Shah gave the chiefship of the tribe to Hajji Husain Khan, of the Nafar tribe (q.v.), who was succeeded at his death by his son Muhammad Taki Khan. The latter's son Ali Akbar Khan then succeeded, but was deposed in 1852 in favour of Mullah Ahmad, of the Ahmadlu branch of Baharlus. Mullah Ahmad then became known as Ahmad Khan, and on his death in 1858 the chiefs of various branches fought for supremacy until 1862, when the government troops interfered, and Mirza Chiragh Ali Beg, son of Shah Eeza Beg, of the Talakeh branch, was appointed chief. He was killed in 1876 by the sons of Nasr Ullah Khan, of the Ahmadlus, and the authorities appointed Husain Khan, the present chief and a relative of the late Mullah Ahmad. The Baharlus are divided into the following 19 branches Ibrahim Khani, Ahmadlu, Ismail Khani, Burbur, Talakeh, Jamalbuzurgi, Jarghah, Jukah, Hajji Attarlu, Haidarlu,' liasulkhani, Sakkiz, Safi Khani, Issabeglu, Kerimlu, Kolahpushi, Meshhedlu, Nazarbeglu, Varaseh.11 BEGLEEBEGGI OF EAKS, HABBIB ULLAH KHAN- Son of Kawam el Mulk, of the Hashimiyeli family (q.v.

They have but a small following now.I138 HAZ1EA TEIBE OF KHOEASSAIST— After the last siege of Herat the Persian commander, Hissam es » Saltaneh, governor-general of Khorassan, brought about 5,000 families of this tribe from Kala Nan, in the Herat district, to Khorassan. They were allotted lands in the Jam and Bakharz districts, and their chief, Yusnf Khan, was given the rank and pay of a Sartip, with a service of Hazara Sowars. After a short time about 2,000 families returned to Kala Nau, and the Persian government did not consider it advisable to leave the remaining families on the frontier. They, therefore, moved them to Isfarain, where they remained some years. Prom Isfarain they were moved to Kana Gusha, a village.near Meshed. In 1877 Yusuf Khan was appointed governor of Bakharz, where he built the village of Muhsinabad, on the Herat frontier, and settled a number of the families there. His son, Ismail Khan, remained with a number of the families at Kana Gusha. Yusuf Khan died in 1885, and was succeeded by his son, Ismail Khan, Shuja el Mulk (q.v.). The Hazaras in Khorassan now number about 1,200 families, who live in Kana Gusha, Kanabist, Kalta Chanar, and Muhsinabad, in the Meshed and Bakharz districts. There are some families in the Zorabad district also. They all are Sunnis. / CUL /it^ C /j fillip /, fret J ^ (i [/ //v* ^fJlf\£ j &lt;r^ ^ Ihnc jf /Ivtf ^ Jple ^ ^ ^r7^r-&gt;v i'l*' (/*- ^ ^ ^ tlx iPt/Vm-C i ^ ^ I i) /16. HISHMAT EL MULK, MIE ALI AKBAR KHAN— Is the present chief of Sistan, and was governor of Tabas. He succeeded his father (who was chief of both Sistan and Kain) in 1891, Ka'in being given over to his younger brother Shaukat el Mulk. He had the governorship of Tabas in 1896, but was dismissed 1897. The government of Tabas was for a long time held by the members of the family of Mir Hassan Khan, Vakil i Tabas. He was of Arab origin, of the tribe of Ibn i Sharban, said to have been brought to Tabas from Arnbia by one of the Safavian kings. The chiefs of the tribe were formerly independent and only nominally under the Shah of Persia, but they gradually lost their power. The government of the district, however, remained hereditary till quite recently. The Vakil of Tabas was succeeded by Hajji Muhammad Bakir Khan, who was granted the title of Imad el Mulk by Nassir ed Din Shah during his first journey to Khorassan in 1867. The Imad el Mulk died in 1894, 77 years of age, and left three sons : Ali Akbar Khan, Muhammad Beza Khan, and Abu'I Kassim Khan. On the Imad el Mulk's death, his eldest son, Ali Akbar Khan, succeeded to his father's title and to the government of Tabas. The second son became Imad i Diwan, and the third son was granted the title of Muin i Diwan, and they were both appointed deputy governors of districts under their elder brother. The Imad el Mulk soon lost the governorship owing to his own incompetence and to the intrigues of his brothers, who persuaded the priests to denounce him as a Babi. He was thereupon summoned to Teheran, and the Imad i Diwan succeeded him. He did not retain his post for long, and was dismissed in 1896, when the district of Tabas was added to the government of the Hishmat el Mulk. On the Eukn ed Dowleh's arrival in Meshed in autumn 1897, Hishmat el Mulk was deprived of the governorship of Tabas, which was given to the Imad i Diwan. This, however, was not confirmed by the Prime Minister, who on obtaining a present from the eldest brother, Imad el Mulk, ordered him to be reinstated. In consequence the Imad el Mulk now holds the government of Tabas. In order to compensate the second son, his title was raised from Imad i Diwan to Imad el Mamalih. These three brothers must now be very near the end of their resources, and when they have no more money their ruin will be complete, and probably a generation hence their descendants will be occupying a position little removed from that of an ordinary peasant. As the Hishmat el Mulk has large resources, in all probability he will eventually oust them from Tabas entirely and get its government for himself. The Hishmat el Mulk has two sons. The eldest, Mir Masum Khdn Sartip, 17 years of age, is deputy governor of Sistan. His mother is a daughter of Sherif Khan Sardar, chief of Nahroes, who occupied a prominent position in Sistan politics after the-boundary arbitration was finished, and afterwards went over to the Afghans, and died at Kabul some eight years ago. Age 45. (Age 60. 12. BALUCH TEIBE OF KHOEASSAN'— A large number of families of this tribe are said to have been brought from Baluchistan to Sistan by Mahmud of Ghazni, from 96 KHORASSAN. 17.

JAMSHIDI TKIBE OF KHOEASSAIST— During the reign of Shah Kamran, the Jamshidi tribe numbered about 12,000 families and were settled, under their chief Zaman Khan, son of Karah Khan, in the Badghis district of Herat. Zaman Khan's cousins, Mir Ahmad Khan, Abdullah Khan and Mehdi Kuli Khan (sons of Jabbar Khan, son of Mahmud Khan), who were also Jamshidi Khans, were inimical to him. From Badghis the tribe migrated to Merv and afterwards to Urganj; about 2,000 families, however, remained and settled at Kurrukh, and Khan Hazrat, the Amir of Urganj, appointed Mir Ahmad Khan as chief of the tribe settled in that district. Abdullah Khan was appointed chief of the Jamshidis in Herat, but he fled to Maimenah, whereupon Allahyar Khan, son of Zaman Khan, took his position. About this time disputes arose between the Urganj and Yamut tribes, and during these disputes Mir Ahmad Khan was killed. The Khan of Urganj then appoinied Mehdi Kuli Khan chief of the Jamshidis, and conferred upon him the title of Khan Aka. During the disturbances in Urganj, Mehdi Khan, who was anxious to return to his former residence, escaped and went to Andkhui. Herat was, at this time, being besieged by the Persians under Hisam es Saltaneh, Sultan Murad Mirza, who, acting under the orders of his government, persuaded 2,000 families of Jamshidis to migrate to Khorassan, under their chief Allahyar Khan, and settled them in the Sar i Jam district. After Hisam es Saltaneh's return from Herat, the Jamshidi families in Andkhui came back to Herat and settled in Badghis, under their chief Mehdi Kuli Khan, Khan Aka, who was after wards murdered by Sardar Ayub Khan at Herat. His son Yalangtush Khan, who succeeded him, was killed by Amir Abdur Eahman Khan. The Jamshidis who had migrated to Khorassan' remained in Sar i Jam for six months, but, as the Turkomans frequently raided that district, they migrated to Kanagushah and Karrabukhah, near Meshed, whence a large number of the families were sent feack to Herat by their chief; and on this becomingQ2 khoeassan, 97 MM Eiaii son of Zw^ ; Dj then appoint )!: [ conferred f)^ bances in ftfi''- 20. a, who.aciiiig^; )0 families 01 ^ lie f AUahyar^^ - jAb.*! at ^ \ to micrrateQ ^ . ; . ! as tbe ^ :;r^- known to the Persian authorities, Allahyar Khan, the chief, fled to Herat. On his flight, the remaining families were placed under the Raoti chief Ismail Khan. The Jamshidis were then moved to Kushkhaneh, in the Kuchan district, where they remained for a few years with the Eaoti families. Afterwards they were brought back to Kanagushah and Karrabukhah. In the meantime Allah yar Khan, being displeased with the treatment he received at Herat from Sardar Yakub Khan, fled to Meshed, and became chief of the Jamshidis in Khorassan. They then numbered about 300 families, but this number was subsequently reduced to 150 by a famine which occurred in Khorassan. Allahyar Khan died at Karrabukhah and was succeeded as chief by his son Zulfikav Khan. In 1885, half of the Jamshidis were sent to Paskamar, and the rest joined them three years after wards. At this time they only numbered about 80 families, which is their present strength. In 1889 Zulflkar Khan opened negotiations with the Eussians, whereupon he and the tribe were sent back to Karrabukhah. He then fled to Eussian territory, and his younger brother Muhammad Azim Khan was made chief. The tribe is now settled in Jellala- bad and Jiza Abad, near Shahan i Garmab, about ten farsakhs from Meshed. Zulflkar Khan returned to Meshed, and settled at Shurja, near Paskamar, where he lives at present. He is about 40 years of age, and, with his brothers, receives a pension. About 50 families of Jamshidis fled from Herat to Khorassan in 1893, and are at present in the Zorabad district under Sayyid Ahmad Beg. The Jamshidis have a service of 50 sowars. KAIYANLU TEIBE OF KHOEASSAK— This is one of the Kurdish tribes moved from Western Persia to Khorassan by Shah Abbas Safavi about 1600. It occupies the districts of Eadkan and Juvain, and consists of some 3,000 families. It has no tribal chief, being under the gover nor of the district—Shuja el Mulk. Its leading khans now are Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (son of Muhammad Reza Khan, late chief of the Kaivanlu tribe and governor of Eadkan), his uncles Kazim Khan and Muhammad Husain Khan, and his cousin Asadullah Khan. The above Kazim Khan is the deputy governor. KAEAI TEIBE OF KHOEASSAN— The Karais are Turks, and a large number of their families were removed from Turkistan to Syria by one of the Mongol kings, whence they were brought to Fars by Amir Tirnur, and eventually from Fars to Khorassan by Shah Ismail Safavi. They remained in [344] HM 98 khoeassan. the Merv and Herat districts for some time, but afterwards settled in the Turbat i Haidari district, which was an almost independent] state in the early part of the nineteenth century. At that time they were a very powerful tribe, but gradually their number declined. This decline 'was the result of rebellion, continued; persecution fit)m the Turkomans, and famine. Ishak Khan Karai, who was then chief/gained great power and was in open rebellion during the reign of Fath Ali Shah. In 1815, he and his son Hassan Ali Khan were killed at Meshed by Muhammad Wall Mirza. The second son, Muhammad Khan Karai, then rebelled,] but was coerced by Hassan Ali Mirza, Shuja es Saltaneh, in 1819. In 1829 he again rebelled and took possession of Meshed; he was subdued, however, by the troops of Ahmad Ali Mirza, son of lath Ali Shah and governor general of Khorassan. He then remained in a semi-independent state, and never properly acknowledged the authority of the Kajars. After his death, the chiefs of the Karai tribe lost their former independence, and gradually the hereditary chiefship was abolished, and the tribe was put under the governor of the Turbat i Haidari district. Their leading khans are Ali Naki Khan, Shaji ul Malk, and Abdur Reza Khan, descendants of Ishak Khan. The former is Sartip of the Karai Battalion, and is about 55 years of age. 22. KAEISHMAE TEIBE OF KHORASSAN— This tribe is also called Fayiij and Gharibzada; but it is generally known as Karishmar in Khorassan. The name is a corruption of 'ghair i shumar' (out of the count). They are gipsies ; and it is said that about 12,000 families of them were brought to Persia] from India by Bahramgiir, to act as singers and dancers. They are scattered all over Khorassan, and number several thousand families. The whole of this tribe is under the Shah's Shatirbashi, who collects their taxes and governs them through his deputies in each province. The chief in Khorassan is Ali Akbar Khan Sartip, son of Hajji Hashim Khan, now dead, a relative of the Shatirbashi who lives at Meshed. He is about 30 years of age. 23.

At the end of the fourteenth century, when Timur removed the Khalaj from Asia Minor to Central and Eastern Persia, a great number of them ran away and settled in Ears, and from this ' running away ' (in Turkish kachmak) the part of the Khalaj which settled in Ears was called Kashkai, i.e., fugitives. They now number about 25,000 families, subdivided into 66 tirah (branches), each with a kalantar or kedkhoda. The chief of the tribe is the Ilkhani, and his deputy is the Ilbeggi; the former generally resides in Shiraz as hostage for the good behaviour of the tribe, while the latter is with the tribe. The last Ilkhani was Darab Khan (b. 1829), son of Mustafa Kuli Khan, Sardar of the Shahilu branch. His ancestor Ismail Khan (son of Jani Aka, son of Namdar Aka, son of Muhammad Aka, son of Safar Ali Aka, son of Jani Aka, son of Kazi Aka, son of Amir Kazi, who flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century) and his brother Hassan Khan were much trusted by Kerrim Khan Zend, and were chiefs of the tribe, but Kerrim Khan's successors blinded Ismail Khan and cut Hassan Khan's hands off. After the death of Ismail Khan, his son, Jani Khan became Ilbeggi, and in 1819 was made Ilkhani. He died in 1824 and was succeeded as Ilkhani by his second son, Muhammad Ali Khan (b. 1793), who died in 1851. Muhammad Ali Khan had married a daughter of Firman Eirma Husain Ali Mirza in 1826, and left three sons by other wives, viz., (a) Jahangir Khan (b. 1815), Ilbeggi, who married a sister of Muhammad Shah and was commander (Sertip) of the Kashkai Infantry Regiment until 1849, when he was appointed governor of Darab. In 1851, on his father's death, he became Ilbeggi and was appointed governor of Kazerun. He died in 1871. His son Muhammad Hassan Khan was Serhang of the Kashkai Infantry, and some time governor of Abadeh, and lately governor of Bonat. The second son was Lutf Ali Khan, who was Sertip of the Kashkai regiment from 1851 until his death in 1856, and left a son— Eajji Muhammad Sadik Khan, now living in Abadeh. His third son, Hajji Nasr Ullah Khan (b. 1840), was Sertip of Kashkai regiment from 1856 to 1878, when he became Ilbeggi and governor of Kamfiruz and Chahar-dangeh. He died some years ago and left a son, Sultan Ibrahim Khan Sarhang (b. 1870). The eldest son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Hajji Husain Kuli Khan, who, of a quiet disposition, was thought to be incapable of succeeding his father as Ilkhani, and settled in Kamfiruz, where three of his grandsons—Abbas Khan, Ali Akbar Khan, and Bakir Khan—are now living. The third son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Murteza Kuli Khan Ilbeggi; he died in 1833 of a wound which he received in an engagement with government troops sent out to seize him. He left two sons, Ali Kuli Khan and Kobad Khan. Ali Kuli Khan was born in 1815, appointed Ilbeggi in 1871, and died not long ago. He left four sons : Allah Kuli Khan, KuhandU Khan, Aman Ullah Khan, and Hahbib Ullah Khan, who are now living. Kobad Khan died some years ago. He left one son. Imam . Kuli Khan, now living. The fourth son of Jani Khan Ilbeggi was Mustafa Kuli Khan Sardar, who was killed at the siege of Kerman in 1831. He left two sons: one Sohrab Khan, who was executed in 1874, and left a son, Bahadur Khan, now living; the other, Darab Khan (b. 1829), the late Ilkhani, who died a short time ago, had three sons, all now living : Abdullah Khan, present Ilbeggi, Ahmad Khan, and Ismail Khan, The fifth son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Muhammad Kuli Khan (b. 1809), who became Ilbeggi in 1835 and Ilkhani in 1851, and died 1867. He had one son. Sultan Mohammad Khan, who became Ilkhani in 1867, resigned in 1871, and has, several times since then, held the governorships of Eerrashband and Firuzabad.MUAYYID-ES-SALTANEH, MIEZA EEZA KHAN— . ns The only son of the late Mirza Husain Khan, Giran May eh, Consul-Greneral of Bagdad. Was educated at the Military College of St. Cyr, Paris. Secretary at the Constantinople Embassy when the late Mushir ed Dowleh, Mirza Husain Khan, was Ambassador. Came to Teheran in 1871-72, and was attached to Mirza Husain Khan, then Sadr Azam.

They are so called because they are natives of old Merv.- A large number of them are said to be in Bokhara territory, and, again, a considerable number are in Herat, where they are called Afshars. Numbers of families also exist in the Teheran, Shiraz, and Astrabad districts. All Mervis in Persia were brought from Merv by Nadir Shah. Those in Khorassan number about one thousand families, and are settled in the Meshed and Jam districts. Their headman is Sharif Khan, son of Muhammad Tahir Khan Mervi. He is about 50 years old and is said to be a descendant of Bairam Ali Khan, of Merv. The other leading men are Beza Beg, 60 years old, and Hassan Khan, 30. The Mervis had a service of 200 sowars, but the number has been gradually reduced to 65. Of these, 20 are under Sharif Khan, 20 under Reza Beg, 5 under Hassan Khan, and the remaining 20 under Sultan Husain Mirza, son of Hajji Muhammad Mirza, governor of Turbat i Haidari. 111 \ ■^RHi295 fii/Vvx&amp;vx if' i/hcdA c^W 6j fun. bufc doJ^i (fau/aw ka* j Onr\i Ckdruj&amp;fc m(Jkoli ^A^AxJj S&amp;l f\p, lf IAa- dz^Sr ujt- /VuuJsSt /hl^ ^ Jyu. tj' Ivu i3l&amp;y\Sk^£ , £l0tL 3. • f )Xy[&amp;kcii /eJi.

He was then taken into the Foreign Office by Sipah Salar Azam and appointed consul-general at Trebizonde. After acting in that capacity for a year or two, he was made consul-general at Baghdad, with title of Mushir el Vizareh, and held that post until 1891, when he came to Teheran and joined the ministry of justice, which was then held by Mushir ed Dowleh. In November, 1896, 'when Mushir ed Dowleh became minister for foreign affairs, he returned to the P.O. and was appointed chief secretary, with his present title, but rarely did any work, and since Jhtesham es Saltaneh (q.v.) joined the P.O. has done none at all. He has a numerous family (seven sons); his eldest son, now about 26 years of age, received the title Mushir el Vizareh when his father received that of Mushavar el Mulk, and acts as assistant to Nazam el Mulk (q.v.); the second son, Yahya Khan, is secretary to the consulate at Baghdad; the third son, Ahmad Khan, is in the translating department of the P.O. in*, /ILCslM^ ..'lie grandson of the late Nassir-el-Mulk, Mahmud Khan, and son f Abdullah Khan, of the Karagnzlu tribe of Hamadan.

Muhammad Eeza Khan, having been well received by Humayun Shah, elected to remain in India and received Machuli Bendar (Mazulipatam) in fief; and his descendants held that district until it was taken by the East India Company. The chief of the family then was Jafar feii/W' Khan, who held an appointment in the East India Company's army; he received a pension of 1440 rupees from the Company, resigned his appointment and went to Kerbela, where he met Mirza Hassan Ali, the son of Hajji Aghassi Beg Shirazi, whose sister he married. He then went to Shiraz, settled there in the Mahallah Maidan i Shah, and died in 1819.

Aka Baba Khan had three sons, Mirza Asad Ullah Khan, Nasr Ullah Khan and Muhammad Zaki Khan, and in 1798, when Path Ali Shah appointed his son, Firman Firma Husain Ali Mirza governor of Fars and sent 80 Nuri tufangchis with him as a special body guard, Aka Baba Khan's two younger sons, Nasr Ullah Khan, and Muhammad Zaki Khan, as well as Hajji Shukr Ullah Khan, a son of the eldest son, went to Shiraz, and their descendants are there now and known as the Nuris of Shiraz. Nasr Ullah Khan died in 1800. Muhammad Zaki Khan became vizir of Fars in 1823, and of his three sons the eldest, Mirza Nairn, became Lashkar Navis Bashi of Fars and died 1875 ; the second, Khair Ullah Khan, was murdered by some Khalaj robbers; and the third, Abbas Kuli Khan, entered military service and rose to be commander of the Kazvin regiments. Mirza Nairn's eldest son, Mirza Ali Muhammad Khan, succeeded his father as Lashkar Navis Bashi of Fars, died 1878, and was succeeded by his son Luff Ali Khan, who was born in 1860, and is now living in Shiraz. Another son of Mirza Naim was Mirza Abdullah Khan Mustanfi, who died at Teheran, and whose three sons, Fath el Mulh (q.v.), Mirza Muhammad Husain Khain, and Zain el Abedin Khan, are now living in Shiraz. The murdered Khair Ullah Khan's eldest son is Aldul Husain Khan, born 1828, Sartip of Artillery, and now living in Shiraz, and his eldest son is Faraj Ullah Khan, Sartip, who married a daughter of Nassi'r el Mulk, son of Kavvam el Mulk I (see Hashimiyeh family), was several times governor of Bandar Abbasi and other small districts of Fars, and is now living in Shiraz. Of Abbas Kuli Khan, the third son of Muhammad Zaki Khan, one son. Khan Baba Khan, Sartip, is now living. Hajji Shukr Ullah Khan, son of Mirza Asad Ullah Khan, who accompanied his uncles to Shiraz in 1798, married a daughter of Firman Firma Husain Ali Mirza in 1826, became Amir i Divan k ■ IKhaneh of Fara and died at Madina in 1844. His two sons were Hajji Muhammad Hashim Khan (born 1812), who succeeded his father as Amir i Divan Khaneh in 1844 and died a few years ago, and Hajji Mihr Ali Khan (born 1816), who became chief com mander of the Pars troops, with the title of Shuja el Mulk, was commander-in-chief of the army opposing the English troops in Fars during the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57, and died 1870. Mirza Muhammad Khan (born 1850), a son of the former, and Mirza Ahmad Khan (born 1858), a son of the latter, are now living j in Shiraz as pensioners of the Government. Mirza Asad Ullah Khan, the eldest son of Aka Baba Khan, remained in Teheran when his brothers and his eldest son, Hajji Shukr Ullah Khan, went to Shiraz in 1798, rose to be Lashkar Navis Bashi of Persia, and the Teheran Nuris are descended from him through his sons : Mirza Nasr Ullah Khan, who is better known as Mirza Aka Khan, Mirza Fazl Ullah Khan, and J afar Kuli Khan. Mirza Aka Khan received the title of Itemad ed Dowleh on ISTassir ed Din Shah's accession, became Sadr Azam on the fall of Amir i Xizam Mirza Taki Khan in November, 1851, and held that post until September 21, 1858, when he was dismissed, and a cabinet of six ministers formed. His eldest son was the late Nizam el Mulk Mirza Kazim Khan, whose eldest son, Nizam el Mulk, Mirza Abdul Vahab Khan (q.v.), married to a sister of Amin ed Dowleh, | is the present Minister of Finance and has two sons, Mudir es Saltaneh, Mustaufi, and Afkham el Mulk, the latter married to a daughter of Izz ed Dowleh (q.v.).

The sons of these three last-named j sons of Mirza Aka Khan, as well as the descendants of Mirza Fazl Ullah Kan Mustaufi and of Jafar Kuli Khan, uncle's of Miza Arka I Khan, are not of any note. SAAD ED DOWLEH HABMB UfcLAH KHAN, TUNAKA- BUNI— / / Is the father of Nasr es S^ftanehVveli Khan; served from early youth in military service. Thr^e or four years ago quelled the disturbances in Kel^rdashty/Mazanderan. Held some small • governorships, and i/ now governor of Irak (Sultanabad).and Egypt, for Mecca. He is to visit England and return by Constantinople and Enssia. This young man is a worthy son of his father, and his development is watched with some apprehension. The father has some moments of remorse, the son none. He is agent for the Persian line of steamers at Mohammerah. The Eeis-ul-Tujjar has an interest in the English carrying trade on the Karun in the form of an annual subsidy of 4,000 kntns; at the expiration of the present agree^ ment, in two years, this may be altered by Messrs. Lynch Brothers to a fee for each package carried by their steamers. It is very necessary that the Reis-ul-Tujjar's great influence with the Sheikh ot Mohammerah and in Arabistan should be used on our^side. It is impossible to say, as yet, whether his son will take his place. The Sheikh of Mohammerah has extended his power, in a verv marked manner tayond that of his late brother. There arc now few signs of Persian authority south of Band-i-Kir to the border of Ears. The Governor of Arabistan does not appear at Ahwaz, nor is there a Karguzar there, as was the case in 1807, when I was last in the country. The Sheikh now nominates the Governors of Ahwaz and Mashur, and controls the Chaab Arabs of Fellahieh, whose Chief is under surveillance at Mohammerah. I ha^e not seen enough of the Sheikh to form an opinion as to his real character. But this extension of his authority must have been brought about by the exercise of a fixed purpose and great ability; perhaps this may be looked for in the direction of the Reis-ul-Tujjar; though the negotiations with the Arabs must have been carried out by Mirza Hamza. Shei ! dl ' s tei rito . rv ^retches apparently along the coast as far as Shah Abdul Shah, a few miles west of Dilani; his authority over this coast is of great importance to us. He has also bought Zeitun, in conjunction with the Bakhtiari Chiefs. He has intimate relations with these Chiefs, and may have come to an understanding with them for mutual defence. His frontier marches with that of the Bakhtiaris from the latitude of Band-i-Kir to south of Ram Hormuz. I do not know exactly where it lies towards the Kuhgdu tribes, but the whole is remarkably safe owing to their combined authority, and there appears to be now no raiding in that direction. r ' The Sheikh's authority is not established towards Hawizeh and the Karkhah in the same manner as it is on the left bank of the Karun - but his operations against the Beni W ' l\t Ver ™! n l d 0U X may extend his P ower in thafc q^rter, though the nebulous state of the Turkish and Persian borders will always tend to insecurity. ✓vPfi don _ e ™ uc h for the suppression of piracy on the Shat-el-Arab, and the safety pljrYn' Karun River in Arabistan ; with encouragement, and to please the affeeW ^ ver ^ Iientj J ould do more - He can give us great assistance in matters attectmg oui Karun trade.

Ha is, on the contrary, accessible from every side. The Karun and JerrahiEivers afford an excellent line of advance from both north and south. As the country between those streams is practically waterless, except between Hohammerah and Felahieh, the camps, flocks, and herds of the Arab tribes are concen trated on the river banks and easily accessible. The centre of the Arab power does not now, as in former times, lie at Hawizeh or Felahieh, which were comparatively secure ; it is at Mohammerah, where two Persian steEiners are constantly anchored and may be supplemented by steamers of the Belgian Customs Administration. We have at present no one to interfere with any arrangements we may wish to make with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but we may not be so favourably situated much longer. He has as yet derived no tangible benefit from his relations with us. If the guarantee he asks for is granted him, he might also be given a subsidy for guarding the projected Khurarnabad road as far as Susa, and paid for the sowars he now maintains on the Bakhtiari road from Nasiri to the border. The Sheikh has lately repaid the money he borrowed from Messrs. Lynch Brothers ; a favourable opportunity may now occur to lend him money at a lower rate of interest. Though wealthy, he is sometimes in want of money before the date harvest is sold as his expenses are very large. (Signed) E. B. BURTON.

The present generation is the eighth in descent from the founder of the family, Mir Ali Khan, of the Arab tribe of Khuzaima, which is said to have been forced to emigrate from Arabia to Khorassan in the time, of Khalifa Harun el Eashid, in the beginning of the ninth century, and was settled in the Kain district as a check on the turbulent natives of that district. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir Ali Khan, their chief, became Amir of Kain about the seventeenth century. His son, Mir Masum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Shah's service, and his grandson, Mir Alam Khan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Eukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his. eye- eight at Meshed in 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently ensued, Mir Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khorassan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Kain by Mir Ismail Khan, and the latter by Mir Alam Khan II, the grand father of Mir Alam Khan III, Hishmat el Mulk, father of the present chief of Kain, and of the present chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Hishmat el Mulk (q.v.) was given to his elder son, Mir Ali Akbar Khan ; and a new title, Shaukat el Mulk, was conferred on his second son. By this the family has been split up into two, and the power of the old Amir pro portionately reduced. The Persian government has now dropped the title of amir, and designates the sons as ' hukmrans ' (governors) of Kain and Sistan. He has no children, and has appointed his younger brother Mir Muhamniad Ibrahim Khan Sartijp, age 15, his heir. ('SHAIKH UL ISLAM FAMILY OF SHIEAZ— The title of Shaikh ul Islam has been hereditary in this family since 1704, when Shaikh Ali Muhammad, the first Shaikh ul Islam of the family, died.

Shaikh Abu'l Kassim. 4. Shaikh Abdul Husain. 5. Shaikh Abdul Ali. The present Shaikh ul Islam and his sons are greatly respected.m ■■■■■■■■■ wmmm timuei tbibe of khoeassak— The Timuris are said by some to be of Tartar origin, but this is not certain, as they have neither a tribal history nor the distinctive Tartar features. It is, however, beyond doubt that they originally came to thesfe parts from Syria, and therefore they may be Arabs. About 20,000 families of these people are said to have been moved from Syria to Turkistan by Amir Timur, hence their name. Amir Timur settled them in the Balkh district, which he gave them, as a dowry to his daughter, who was married to Mir Sayyid Kalal, a saint of Arab descent living on the banks of the Oxus, who was Amir Timur's spiritual guide. On Mir Sayyid Kalal's death, the tribe was distributed among his sons. One of these sons, Sayyid Mir Shahid (also called Mir Shah Khan), got about four thousand families and removed them : from Balkh to the Herat district. He was very considerate and kind to his people, and his amiable qualities attracted the majority of the families remaining in Balkh, who also joined him and settled in the Herat district. When Muhammad Shah Kajar besieged Herat in 1838, he moved about eight thousand families to Khorassan under their chief, Kilich Khan, a great-grandson of Mir Sayyid Kalal, who gained great power and became the ruling chief of the districts of Jam, Bakharz, Khaf, and Zorabad, with the title of amir. About two thousand families of Timuris are said to be still in the Herat, Sabzawar and Farah districts of Afghanistan. The Timuris of Khorassan number some six thousand families. They are scattered in the Meshed, Jam, Bakharz, Zorabad and Sarakhs districts and are under Mir Ali Mardan Khan, Nusrat el Mulk (q.v.), their present chief.

The notes give the subject's name as heading, and various information including dates of birth and death, office and career history, family details (including members of the Shah's family), pay and financial details, interests, linguistic abilities, and some personal comments.The introductory page (folio 4v), which is signed by Churchill and dated 1904, is inscribed 'Strictly Confidential and for the Use of His Majesty's Government Officials Only'. A manuscript note states that the volume had been compiled from a variety of sources, and embodied the bulk of Colonel H Picot's biographical note of 1897, which Churchill had endeavoured 'to bring up to date and amplify'.
